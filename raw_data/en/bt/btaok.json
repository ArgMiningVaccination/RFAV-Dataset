W. E. RfALSTON HEIGHTS\" Hopewell, N. J. WILL YOU? * * * Will you read this book twelve times? If you will, we will make it worth your while. This book contains the most successful system of modern times; its results are attracting attention everywhere. We ask of you, as a personal favor, that you will carefully, slowly, patiently and thoroughly read every word of this won\u00ac derful work once a month for twelve months; for reading means adoption. If you read this book through once you will con\u00ac sciously or unconsciously live up to some of its standards; two readings will establish new lines of thought that will affect your daily existence; three readings will start new habits; and a dozen readings will bring your whole life into a clear understanding of the mighty influences that are at work to make you into a new being, so much superior to your present self that two photographs, one taken now, and one a year hence after twelve readings, will show two different personalities! Are you willing to become an example of perfect health, of vigorous energy, of powerful physique, and of magnificent ap\u00ac pearance, so that your friends and acquaintances will marvel at the change? If so, the Ealston Health Club will stand by you through thick and thin, and will prove its friendship at all times. This book is paid for; you owe us nothing; we ask no money; all we want is that you give the system twelve readings, and make your\u00ac self an example of its power. 4 RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 5 Platt nf tlw -jferamtal look The Ralston Health Club teaches in this book that diet, fixed rules, exercise, and other widely used methods are power\u00ac less to bring the weakened human body back to normal condi\u00ac tions. All these things are good for a while; but they fall short of the great end desired. No two persons are alike. Each individual should know himself, and be shown the way to find his needs. The diet that is good for one person may not be good for another. There is a way to know what one wants, and this way is taught in the present work. While there are laws that are valuable at all times, there are no rules that lift the body out of its depressions, and the more this course is insisted upon, the less attractive life be\u00ac comes. New impulses are needed to take the place of those that are lacking in the broken temple. The better plan is to bid farewell to the old body, discard it part by part, and build a new edifice in its place. As it lives in the act of a constant change, this method is both feasible and simple. It is possible to become some one else; to have a new brain, new flesh, new blood, new nerves, new faculties, and a wholly different body. A person who is now in good health can do nothing better than to make the body IMMUNE by this process of a new creation. But one who is ill or weak can find no power in this world that will bring permanent health except under the plan of the pres\u00ac ent work. This Personal Book is complete in itself. It proceeds by a logical increase of value along the follow\u00ac ing steps: 1. It removes part by part the old body. 2. It uses perfect material and a high state of vitality in building or creating, part by part, a new body. 3. It then shows the way to keep the new body always at the highest standard of health. 6 PERSONAL BOOK 4. It recognizes the fact that nature, from the beginning of life, sets up processes that bring on ripening; that these pro\u00ac cesses are necessary in order to give the body of the infant the growth that brings strength and maturity; but that, after such maturity, the processes may be checked and controlled for a re\u00ac markable length of time. 5. It brings the organs into their best functional duties, and the faculties into the highest state of usefulness. 6. It recognizes the law of nature that the ripening pro\u00ac cesses cause a wearing out and breaking down of the faculties, and thus invite decreptitude long before life should be on the wane. 7. It shows the individual what course is best to pursue in seeking personal health. IT TEACHES \"THE HEEDS THAT MAKE EARTH BETTER.\" RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 7 CREED OF THE RALSTONITES BELIEVE that life on this earth may be made beau\u00ac tiful and productive of happiness in the highest degree. Our reason for so believing is based on the fact that Nature is filled with possibilities of extraordinary beauty in all her works, and she is constantly holding out to humanity the ways and means of a splendid enjoyment of her gifts. W RECOGNIZE the fact that the human race is facing X a struggle for existence, the like of which has never been known since the dawn of civilization. All the inventive genius of man is today concentrated on methods by which his greed may reap increasing profits, even to the extent of producing inferior and adulterated goods of every character that are needed as food for the people, so that at the present time it is almost impossible to obtain the necessaries of life in wholesome form. Health suf\u00ac fers. People who are only half-well go about their work as best they can. Their earning capacity is lessened. Others are too ill or too weak to bear their part in the battle of life. RECOGNIZE the fact that this lack of health is bring- K ing increased expenses to every family; that to meet the demands of the sick and the half-well, the medical profession is increasing its numbers much faster than the population is increas\u00ac ing; and that this great army of doctors must be supported by the people who still retain their earning capacity. 8 PERSONAL BOOK RECOGNIZE the fact that the demand for drugs and medicines is rapidly growing. The annual consumption of such concoctions is so great that a freight train extending from Maine to California would, if heavily loaded to the top of each car, carry only two-thirds of the drugs that enter the human sys\u00ac tem every year. A large proportion of this freightage consists of patent medicines, which contain the slave-habit drugs of opium, laudanum, morphine, cocaine and chloral, as well as alcohol; and the result of the wide sale of such medicines is the fastening on the people of drug habits which, once started, can never be thrown off. There are now in the United States more than one million victims of these narcotic drugs, and one hundred thousand new victims are being added every year! Thus in the effort to obtain relief from the illness due to the forced use of inferior and adul\u00ac terated foods, the people seek the help of medicines only to find themselves becoming slaves to drug habits that are worse than death. RECOGNIZE the fact that the earning capacity of the people in all ranks of life, in and out of business and the professions, is decreased by the forced use of inferior and adul\u00ac terated foods; and the expense of methods to cure the illness that follows, is constantly growing larger; added to which is the in\u00ac creased cost of all necessaries of life; reaching at this time a total burden so great that it is being only temporarily endured. These three influences are more than human conditions can meet, and much more than human nature will long submit to. Each influ\u00ac ence has its source in an inordinate greed that seeks all the profit it can reap, regardless of the suffering that is brought to the peo\u00ac ple at large. 11% THEREFORE stand face to face with three enemies of health: 1. \u2014The adulterators of foods. 2. \u2014The makers of drugged medicines. 3. \u2014The controllers of the necessaries of life. And, by the system contained in this Personal Book, we offer a double boon to humanity: \u2014Perfect health free from the greed of these three enemies. b.\u2014A rich longevity.

ONSTANT reference is made in this book to that power which is ever present in all things that live, and which holds the secret of health or illness. What it is, no one knows. What it does, is a matter of com\u00ac mon knowledge. The same elements that make np a living body, may be brought together by the chemist, but they will not become life. Something is lacking, and the chemist cannot give it. A plant cannot be fed on food that is wholly artificial. If potash and lime are added to the soil, they must be drawn into the life of the soil before they can nourish the plant. They thus become life, and are then said to be organized into living con\u00ac ditions. A live plant placed in soil that is rich but wholly arti\u00ac ficial, would not grow. Nor must more matter be added to any soil than the soil can take up into its own life and make natural; for such excess will destroy the plant. All food of the human body is of plant growth. It may come in the form of meat, but always from an animal that has fed on plant life in some way. A person who eats meat from a meat-fed animal, cannot long remain healthy; for such food is too far removed from the source of natural energy which is plant growth. 12 PERSONAL BOOK The kind of food that the plant thrives on is well known; and the same kind of food is necessary for the human body. The plant performs the duty of organizing lifeless material into living material. No other agency on earth can perform this duty. What is good for the plant is good for man; but man is not able to organize lifeless material into living matter. Nature is so anxious to keep her supply of life abundant that she breaks out everywhere into plant existence. If man will not cultivate the soil, nature will till it with weeds or any chance growth that she has at hand. The neglected farm, if not in grass, will run to a wonderful luxuriance of weeds for a few years; after which coarse brush will follow; and finally a forest will occupy the soil. If you set out a vegetable garden and leave it to itself, in a few weeks you will find a host of weeds for each and every plant you have induced to grow there. No place escapes this purpose of nature to keep her fund alive. She is merely converting all lifeless material of the soil into living matter. When the time comes that she will cease to do this, the earth will become a dead planet. Man is able to get together the lifeless material. He has tried for ages to bring life into it. But the one thing essential is lacking, and that is Uital mfe. This double term may seem to contain a repetition of mean\u00ac ing; but there is a distinction between life that is vital and life that is not vital. Thus the soil may be filled with live food ready for the plant; yet it does not become Uit&l ICtfp until it enters the plant and puts forth an energy that gives increasing power to that plant. In the human body another slightly different distinction is made, and it is this: The parts of the body that are not under the sway of the energy of nature, are said to contain life; while the one part that is at any one time swayed by such energy is said to possess the dominant force known in this system as Uital Htfr. This energy is movable. In a healthy person it is present at the stomach during di\u00ac gestion. If it is absent then, there can be no real good in the meal itself. . The habit of eating when the Uxtal Htfe is some\u00ac where else, is one of the common causes of bad health arising from indigestion. The food will pass into a sour or fermented RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 13 condition which will give rise to gases and to poisons that affect the heart, the liver and the kidneys, resulting in poor blood and loss of tone in the system. Httal IGtfe follows the source of greatest demand. It is mov\u00ac able and travels about the body. If you worry, your Utfai Slife will cling to your brain, and, being thus absent from your stomach, you cannot digest your food. Excessive joy does the same thing. Many a person is unable to digest a meal when good fortune has taken complete possession of the mind. It has always been sup\u00ac posed that worry alone would stop digestion; but the fact is that whatever will absorb the attention, whether excess of good or bad news, will draw the Uttal ICtfp from the stomach and thus leave that organ without the means of carrying on successful digestion. This fact is today well known, although it is new to the world at large. Many experiments have been made with this power, and some of these will be given attention in this system. To begin with, nature supplies each and every child at birth with its Itital Stiff. The parentage has much to do with the character of the supply to start with. But conditions may improve or lessen the first gift; as a daily change is going on all the time, year in and year out. What was weak to begin with may be made strong; and what was strong to begin with, may be made weak by the kind of treatment received. Many strong children come into the world, only to grow sickly by the diet and habits thrust upon them. Many others are weak when they come into the world, and grow strong by reason of receiving good food and care from the very start. The spark of life is often snuffed out by innocent igno\u00ac rance; or it is lessened by neglect and bad methods; or it is made to flame up out of almost nothing into a great power. It is like the fire on the hearth stone; almost gone out; but capable of being fanned into a new vigor if some one will only try. Grown persons are slowly dying because of this lack of knowl\u00ac edge and painstaking care. Their Uttal ICtf? is becoming weaker every day. Countless causes are at work; the foremost of which are errors in the selection and preparation of food. The rush and friction of modem life play their part as well. There is no rule of nature that has so few exceptions as that which declares that simplicity of food and habits is necessary to a strong vitality. 14 PERSONAL BOOK It comes down to the point of choice between two leading high\u00ac ways: one avoiding the excitement of fast living for the sake of good health; the other choosing to take chances of breaking down the constitution in the eagerness to live at a faster clip than ever before. The following statements are for study only, and MAY BE OMITTED BY THE GENERAL READER IF TOO UNINTERESTING. 1. The power to throw off disease depends always in the first place on the amount of Uttal Sltf? present in the body. 2. If the supply is abundant, it is never possible for a person to take any malady that is contagious. No matter how great may be the exposure to the germs of consumption, small pox, typhoid, meningitis, pneumonia, grippe, diphtheria, or any of the other dreaded diseases, no impression is made on the health of the person so exposed. This is not a theory; it has been proved many times, and is being proved today in all parts of the world. 3. It is positively know that a man or woman whose Uttal iCtfc has been increased beyond a certain point, needs no other protection against sickness. The rules of hygiene never apply to such a person. It makes no difference how much germ-laden dust may be floating in at the windows or rising from the floor. The germs of tuberculosis die in attacking such a constitution. Im\u00ac pure milk, and typhoid drinking water from wells poisoned by surface drainage cannot bring harm. Every law of cleanliness may be broken with impunity. It is true that others who are less fortunate might suffer from such habits of carelessness; but, by the fiat of the survival of the fittest, the individual who makes his body vital in its life, is sure to go unscarred. 4. The proneness to a common cold is merely the sign of a low state of the'Uxtal ICtfo as a vigorous degree of health is sure to ward off all colds. One person is careful every minute of the night and day; another is careless. Yet the former is subject to a cold many times in the year; while the latter never has one. It is not because of the hardening process that colds are kept away. Many a person has gone into fatal pneumonia by trying to make the body hard by lack of care. It all depends on the amount of Uxtttl IGtfp present. Nothing else determines the fact. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 15 5. Much of the prevailing illness of the human race is due to the use of things as foods that are not foods; and an increase of Uital Safe will not bring immunity against such maladies. Thus appendicitis is due to adulterations in foods, baking powders and meats; and no person's vitality can withstand poison; although some succumb to it more easily than others. Rheumatism also is the result of long persistence in eating too many non-food ele\u00ac ments, and vitality will not keep it away. All food elements that the body needs and uses are free from this influence; but, as those elements that are not food or that contain parts that are not food, are regarded as poisons, the use of them is an act of poisoning the body; and this explains rheumatism. Certain fruits at all times, and all fruits under certain conditions, contain poisons that result in rheumatism. A plain example of this fact is seen in the common tomato. It contains oxalic acid, which is a poison to the body; and a person who is easily subject to rheu\u00ac matism, will invite a severe attack by eating tomatoes in any form; while people who do not become rheumatic will find no harm in them. It all depends on how much poison the blood has already accumulated; a little more may be carried in some cases; in others a greater quantity will be safely absorbed. 6. But, omitting such maladies as appendicitis and rheuma\u00ac tism which are due to poisons that are almost harmless in foods, other forms of sickness depend on the Uttttl ICtfe present in the body. You may become immune against contagious and against every germ disease; but you cannot become immune against poi\u00ac sons unless you stop taking them. Vitality is never able to defy such enemies. If therefore you would increase your Uital iEtfe you must make up your mind to lessen all poison foods that you are now in the habit of taking. Having taken this step, then you may successfully build up an enormous power that will protect you against everything in this world except violence or accident; and these may be lessened by the greater degree or precaution that will follow your advent into the ranks of the immunes. 7. The child that hovers between life and death, will live if its vitality is not too low. There the turning point is met in all such cases. 8. A man of iron will lay on a bed of sickness. He pos\u00ac sessed enough will power to save a thousand men; but his Utfctl was at low ebb. He had been losing it for years; and now. 16 PERSONAL BOOK when he was ill and needed it, he did not have it, and so he died. After the awful attack of pneumonia many a great man whose life would have been of great value to the nation, has faded away because the vital spark was too weak. In fact of all the deaths from pneumonia, nine in every ten come when the vitality has diminished below the mark where life can be sustained. The same fact is found in typhoid. If the patients had acquired a fair degree of vitality during the years of freedom from ill health, they would be able to survive the crisis in the fever. If they had acquired a large amount of'JJital they could never have been felled by this malady or any other contagious disease; in fact, they would never have been made ill. 9. Except for the poisons that give rise to appendicitis and rheumatism, sickness is impossible in any human being who has built up the Uital Htfr. 10. To this act of building up such life in the body, add a sensible selection of foods from day to day, and you will have solved the whole problem of health and longevity. 11. A double duty is therefore taught herein: First, the building of Uiial IStfe Second, the avoiding of poisons in food. Having taken these two steps, you will find yourself absolutely and forever immune against sickness in every from. You will never have a sick day. You will never know what pain is. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 17 Chapter Two LIFE CENTERS The human body is a machine that is fed by life electricty generated In the nervous centers and stored in countless batteries HETHER a man is awake or asleep, his body is at work as long as he lives. The vital life is attracted to whatever part is most in use. If the stomach is doing its work it holds the vital host aronnd its region. If the mind is busy, it retains the vital host. As this host or mass of traveling vitality cannot sustain two operations at the same time and do both well, it is best to separate them. You cannot carry on digestion when your mind is intensely engaged in any task. If a hard problem is there, then the mind holds the vital host, and the stomach will wait. It has been proved that a meal eaten just before a five-hour business meeting of the greatest importance, remained for all this time in the stomach in just the condition as when it entered. Dogs who have started on a hard run immediately after a meal, and been killed in the chase, have shown that digestion had not even been commenced. This proves that vigorous physical effort demands the vital host, just as vigorous mental effort re\u00ac quires it. So worry of the mind will attract the vital host, and the stomach will have to wait; or rather the food will ferment. An effective experiment has been made by hundreds of thou\u00ac sands of Ralstonites with the vital host. When it was found that the mind would indulge in thinking as soon as a person got in bed for the night's slumber, it was suggested that the vital host, havihg no other call, took its place in the brain and compelled the mind to work. The thinking delayed and often destroyed the 18 PERSONAL BOOK night's sleep. They then tried the experiment of taking a bowl of hot bouillon soup as soon as they had got in bed. This was an attraction to the stomach, enough to keep it active, and not a nitrogenous meal that would cause distress in digestion. Being in the stomach, the soup at once drew the vital host from the brain, and sleep intervened long before the bouillon was digested. This experiment has been tried so many thousands of times that doctors have now adopted it as one of the means of inducing sleep when it is lightly interfered with. As the vital host cannot be in the brain and the stomach at the same time, and as it is the cause of sleeplessness in light cases, the attraction to the stomach relieved the brain of its presence. The counter irritant used so much in medical practice pro\u00ac ceeds on the same law. The soaking of the feet in hot water and mustard is still a good remedy to draw the clogged and sluggish blood from the chest and head. When you suffer from indigestion and an inactive liver, un\u00ac dress, get in a bath tub, and bathe one side of the body from the hip bone to the armpit; then wipe it dry; using warm, and then hot water in the bathing; and cool water in the rinsing. Wipe it vigorously until very dry. Then wet the head and bathe the other side of the body from the hip bone to the armpit with cool water, and no hot water; and keep making it colder; then wipe dry. But just before it is wiped, note the extraordinary vitality of the side that was first bathed, provided you have not splashed any water on the first side when bathing the second side. This shows how the vital host travels about. It is an in\u00ac teresting and important experiment. The next night, reverse the sides, but bathe in like manner, and note that the vital host has gone to the second side. Its presence is so distinct that it is a source of wonder. Suppose your chest and lungs are weak, or the circulation is sluggish; all you need do is to invite the vital host to the weak part. This is done by undressing and getting in a bath tub, in a room where the temperature is eighty or more, or not much under eighty. Be careful not to get water on any part of the body except the chest, just where you wish the vital host to appear. Bathe that first in tepid water, then in hot water, then in hotter RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 19 water, and finally rinse in cool, but not cold water. If no part of the body has been made wet but the front chest, or the whole girth of the chest around the body front and back, then you will be ready for the next step in the test, which is to wet the head and bathe the body from the hip bones dowm to the feet in mildly warm water, then in cool water, and finally in cold water. Avoid rush of blood to the head. Between the act of bathing the chest in the manner stated and the act of bathing the lower body, the chest should be wiped dry, not a particle of moisture remaining there. As soon as the chest is dry, and the cool water is put on the legs, the vital host will go to the chest in great volumes and there invigorate it for a while. You will notice the exhilarating effect of the presence of so much vitality. The oftener these experiments are made, provided the diet is plain and nutritious, the more the vital host will grow. Some persons have given it so much increase of volume that it has nearly taken the place of the elaborate natural system known as Life Electricity which is described in the final pages of this book. If your head is dry and you go into the ocean for a bath, the vital host will travel to the head, and may cause over-pressure. As all bathers are presumed to know this, they first wet the head in cool water and then go in with the whole body. As the head dries it must be again wet. An arm that was shriveled and that no doctor could restore, was brought back to its full size by this use of the vital host; it would be bathed in warm water which was gradually made hotter; then it would be cooled in mildly temperate water and wiped dry; after which the legs from the hip bones down to the feet were bathed in cool and then cold water; during which time the arm would receive the vital host and be nourished. Many repetitions brought it back to health. There are scores of pretended secrets for building the bust and filling in the hollows of the upper chest, so as to give better symmetry to that part of the body; but they depend on grease and massage, unless they adopt the plan in the work on Chest Culture which belongs to Ealstonites of the tenth degree. But the use of the vital host as a builder of any part of the body is so satisfactory that it is superseding all secret methods. It is healthy and safe, which means a great deal. 20 PERSONAL BOOK Suppose you wish to build up some thin part of the body, say the hollows of the chest; the first thing to do is to establish a plain diet in eating, according to the rules of this book; then take the vital bath. The hollows must be bathed with warm, then with hot, then with hotter water; then rinsed with cool water; allowing no water to go to other parts of the body. Wipe dry and thoroughly. Then wet the head and bathe the legs from the hip bones to the feet with warm, then with cool, then with cold, then with very cold water; and you will at once note the tremen\u00ac dous inflow of the vital host at the hollows of the chest, or wherever you seek to build the body. This is called creating a new body by the vital host process. Suppose the circulation of the heart is weak; send the vital host to that part in the same way. Here is an oft made experiment used to cure weak stomach. As is well known, when the stomach will not digest food the vital host will not visit it. Undress; bathe the region over the stomach with warm, then with hot, then with hotter, then with very hot water; rinse with warm, then with cool, then with cold water; wipe so as to cause great friction. When the region is dry, wet the head and bathe the legs from the hip bones down to the feet with cool, then with cold water; and at this time the vital host will be at the stomach. As it is not a thin surface flow, but a thick mass occupying much of the interior of the body, it will have entered the stomach itself, and have accomplished more good than any other known treatment in the world. Sluggish liver, and hardening of the liver, may be treated in the same way. In a large number of cases, the results have been like miracles. The circulation of the blood is of itself of great value, and this is the smallest of the effects produced; for the vitality is a still greater agent for recovery from an abnormal condition. If tried in the manner described, the vital host will accom\u00ac plish wonders; and it will grow with the using, just as any faculty grows with the using. It is well to make one experiment every time you take a bath as it does not interfere with the bathing; nor does it take longer. In the summer time some persons bathe mornings and evenings; in the winter once a day or three times a week. The oftener you generate the vital host, the healthier you will be; so RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 21 bathe as often as yon please. The difference will be seen very soon in your personal appearance. The principle is this: There is in the atmosphere a vast fund of vitality, contain\u00ac ing the spark of life. No person has his full share. You can obtain more. Every time you draw the vital host to any part of the body, you catch from the general fund of the atmosphere a greater share. If your diet is plain and wholesome, it unites with the new materials and makes a better body with a New Identity. In the generating room of an electric power house, with all doors and windows shut, the general fund of electricity that is in the air is made to give up some part of itself under the force of the inviting energy of the engines. Yet that fund is never weakened. Enough in one room can be drawn to furnish the power equal to millions of horses, yet the fund is just as strong. So with the spark of life. The fund is there all about you; it needs only the generating effort of the body to draw it forth and to appropriate it. You can create a new vital body, part by part, in this way, and you can draw a new life to dwell in it. Try it. The results will surprise you. Storage of Vitality. One of the most remarkable of laws in life is the simplest. The body is all the time generating its life; but there is a fearful waste going on all the time. When this waste stops, the body accumulates an immense fund of vitality. In the study of personal magnetism, which is nothing at all like Life Electricity, the same rule is made to work wonders in so quick a time as to seem impossible until the process is watched. In this work now before us the following facts are our guide: 1. When the body takes enough food to supply it with its needed nutrition, it uses but little of the vital host in digesting and assimilating it; and this amount is quickly restored by the natural life of the body. 2. When the food supply is in excess of the actual needs of the body, as is the case in almost all instances where the health is not good, the vital host is called upon to digest and assimilate the needed food, and to break down and throw off the extra 22 PERSONAL BOOK accumulation. When it is not able to do all this work, fever or fasting or other agency must be called in to help it. But the vital host has been weakened at every step of this hard work. 3. The art of eating enough wholesome food and no more, is the fine art of perfect health; for it leaves the vital host to its own accumulations, which means that it will build itself up when the overtax is removed from it. How to Measure Life Energy. The following method of making a gauge of your stored life energy, will prove interesting. 1. Take the stronger arm, which is generally the right. 2. Learn to open the fingers and thumb to the greatest spread. Anything less than the fully open digits will not do. The test rests on this one act. Each digit of the hand is directly associated with the brain, as will be seen in the book on Life Electricity. 3. Hold the arm out directly in front of the body, on a level with the shoulder, and fully extended. The palm of the extended hand must face the ceiling and be parallel with it. 4. Open the five digits to their full spread, tense and tightly apart each time. Shut them close bringing the fist together as if to crush an object in the hand. This wide open action and close shutting will make count One. When you open and shut the hand again in the same manner, it is count Two. 5. Five full counts of opening and shutting will constitute One Per Cent, in the measure of your Life Electricity. 6. The arm must not be lowered, nor the hand changed in any way from its position of action. 7. If you can succeed in making ten counts of the double action of opening and closing, you will have a credit of two per cent, for your first trial. This is good. Twenty such actions would be four per cent, which is grand. Five hundred such actions would be perfect, which is impossible if done right, until you have built up a great vitality.

N?ut Pfgsfrai RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 25 Chapter Three how WE RIPEN The moment we are born we ail begin to die for It Is natural law that earthly life is mortal. MANITY, like all life, ripens. Nature sets up a law that works itself into death. The law is that of the first development from birth. No matter whether it is a plant, a blade of grass, an animal or man, the young days lead on into maturity, and this much is necessary. Nothing can be born at full size of an adult being, for there is not room enough to spare for that purpose. Having to begin small, it is necessary that size and strength should be added, and this is done by an excess of mineral matter in the nutrition. The sap in the plant is overloaded with mineral material; and the blood of the child is likewise charged with an excess which is found in almost all kinds of food. It is the mineral matter in food that changes the gelatine of the infant form into cartilage, and later the cartilage into bones. It is the mineral excess that increases the size of the hones so that the frame of the body shall keep getting larger until it is large enough; and, when the normal or desired size is attained, the bones stop growing while the mineral matter keeps coming into the blood through the food. Even in the vegetable kingdom every plant, every tree has a certain time in which to make its growth, a certain time in which to maintain its prime, a certain era through which to ripen, and a certain period for dying. 26 PERSONAL BOOK The same relationship exists in all the higher animals. In the nobler species of the animal kingdom below man, where care is given to the health of the animals, there is a uniform increase of life; and it is well known that the average age is closely allied to the time of developing the first period. The infancy and childhood period of plant and animal life is one-tenth of the average duration of such life; allowing careful attention to the life at every stage. This period is that which precedes the power of parentage. Where life is left to the vicissi\u00ac tudes of Nature, its duration does not follow any fixed rule, although many writers claim that it does, and from it they reach the same results that are to be stated here. Parentage in the human family is possible on an average at the end of twelve years. In some climates it happens three years earlier, and in others three years later; and life seems to be weakened or strengthened in proportion as such period is early or late. The longer the power of parentage is delayed, the longer should be life, all other influences being normal. Aside from this line of proof, there are many other facts that point conclusively to the intention of Nature to extend human life to an average of 120 years. The old time belief that seventy years is the limit, is not verified by the facts of the past centuries; for the average duration is actually less than thirty years; while, on the other hand, many of the most devout men and women of the church have lived to be ninety and over, no less than a thousand having passed the one hundred year mark. There are a few to-day who are more than 120 years old, some who are about 115, and quite a number who are 105 and over. The fact that the average age is less than thirty years is readily explained by the lack of proper food and regime. The surprise is that any person could reach even ninety under the errors of the times. It is necessary that the osseous tendency should occur in youth. This process makes the bones and gives the hardness. All foods and liquids, except fruits and distilled water, contain carbonate and phosphate of lime and other calcareous salts, which develop bones; and, by a continuous action, carry the tendency to every part of the body. When the bones become hardened, the body reaches its limit of growth. If a young person should eat RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 27 such food and drink such water as the grown person ought to have, the bones would not harden for many years, and the body would attain to great size. This hardening of the bones deter\u00ac mines why some persons are small and other large. At birth all bones are gelatine. Life begins in gelatine and ends in bones. Ask any physician; he will tell you that old age is but the osseous tendency of heart, brain, and arteries; that ninety-seven per cent, of all people past middle life are ossifying, or turning to bones, in the heart, in the brain, and in the arteries; that a steady, gradual change in this direction is going on from youth to age; and that when any part of the body, excepting the bones, begins to secrete bony matter, weakness follows; resulting, first, in re\u00ac ducing the circulation, second, impoverishing the blood, third, breaking down tissues, and fourth, exposing the organs to the ravages of germ life. These facts are stated by Koch, Grumaine, Browne, Lews, Bichat, Bailie, and a score of others: and are proved by observation. To deprive the child of carbonate and phosphate of lime and other calcareous salts which develop and harden the bones, would result in rickets. But allowing it enough of these foods to slowly harden the bones, growth of the gelatine conditions would continue for many years, even until the child should attain thirty or forty years of age; with the result that an enormous size would be reached. This also would retard the ripening of maturity. There was once a time when the conditions of food and water were favorable to the slow development of the child. Tradition and various historical accounts state that there were giants in those days, and people lived for hundreds of years. The mistake that humanity has been making is in not study\u00ac ing the question of food and water. Nature provides the bone-making food and drink for the growing body; because she seeks to preserve the race. When maturity is reached, Nature leaves man to find out for himself what to eat and drink, and he goes right on eating and drinking the very things that were used in giving his body growth. All persons ripen. The process of ripening is only the hardening of the blood vessels in the organs. This compels them to work harder in order to sustain life, and they thus stiffen and become decrepit. It is the work of the mineral material in the food; which, being in 28 PERSONAL BOOK excess for the purpose of increasing the size of the body, carries its excess into the system after the body has attained its size. Each blood vessel, vein and artery is a hollow tube, having an active inner surface that urges the blood on by its motion. The excess of mineral matter in the blood is sure to linger on those delicate inner surfaces and gradually harden and stiffen them. As all flesh is composed of tissue that is filled with blood vessels, the latter when they lose their elasticity make the general body seem stiff; and so the man feels his age coming on. He gets out of bed in the morning and is not as limber as once he was when the blood was young. He rises from his chair and the legs are more like pipe stems than rubber. He is growing old. Experiments in feeding animals that are matured, with a diet that is mostly free from mineral matter, and giving them only distilled or pure, soft water, has resulted in prolonging their lives to more than double their extreme normal age. The test is simple and is easily within reach of every person who cares to make it. The result is the direct and certain proof that the contents of food and drink determine how long an organism will live. Scientific feeding of horses, and the use of rain water as drink, will cause them to live from forty to sixty years. There are horses at work today, and nimble too, that are thirty years of age; one such horse is close at hand as these lines are being written. A pet cat that has had only rain water to drink is now twenty-eight years old, and has not given up even one of its nine lives. Nature sets in motion certain laws, and leaves it to man to discover their variability. Nature produces new varieties of life, by her accidental departures from parentage. But man is able to make fast and lasting use of her laws by directing their impulses. He has developed in half a century a greater span of improvement in animal breeds than she would have made in ten thousand years, if at all. Nature realizes the necessity of an excess of mineral matter in the diet of animal and man; for the child would remain the child if there were not such an excess. It alone makes growth. Now she keeps right on witti the same food. The young heifer makes the cow because of the extra proportion of mineral matter in her food; but, when she has become the cow and does RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 29 not need the material that caused the growth, she does not know how to avoid eating it, and so she goes right on and ripens, stiffens, gets old and dies. Man has not, in an extensive way, yet controlled her processes. He is beginning to do so. He has found that animals may be made to live much longer, even to more than double their normal lives, if their food and drink are deprived of the excess of mineral matter. It may be asked why, if growth is caused by the excess of mineral matter, the body will not keep on growing as long as that excess is maintained. Nature fixes the average size of each species, and the growth is checked under her commands when that size is reached; so that the continued excess of minerals be\u00ac comes the cause of ripening instead of extra size. But, on the other hand, it has been proved that an unusual proportion of mineral matter in food during the first part of the young life will set in motion an impulse to a size greater than the average when maturity is reached. To effect this end, the first part of infancy or the beginning of each life must be specially fed. The size of the child is determined by the size of its bones, and its bones are made by mineral matter in food and drink. When the food and drink that are taken in the first two years of the life of the child, contain an excess of mineral matter, the body of the child will grow fast, and this start will be maintained all through life. Animals are being fed along these lines, and the results are always the same. To dwarf an animal, give it food and water that are free from mineral excess; beginning at the first part of its young life; and it will not grow large. The same animal, if the food and drink were shifted to the reverse and contained a great excess of mineral matter, would become un\u00ac usually large. To repeat what has already been stated, if the animal when it has reached its growth, is given food and water free from an excess of minerals, it will not begin to ripen. The blood vessels will not retain in their inner walls the lime that deprives them of their elasticity; and so age will be delayed; a fact that is being proved every day now. Several laws that seem to contradict themselves now appear: 1. The absence of mineral matter in the child will give it the rickets. 30 PERSONAL BOOK 2. An excess of mineral matter causes bone growth, and the size of the body depends on the size of the bones. 3. Too great an excess of mineral matter in the first years of infancy will start a tendency to a large body growth, but if begun in later youth it will hasten the development of maturity and stunt childhood. 4. A slight excess of mineral matter in later youth will prolong youth and keep the body growing larger for several years. Human beings have tried the same law and have seen the wonderful effects of its operation. We all dread to have the body become stiff as age draws on. This stiffness is known to be due to the presence of mineral matter in the countless blood vessels of the flesh and organs. Some writers refer to it as becoming ossi\u00ac fied; that is, the blood vessels turn in part to bone. The Brain is a mass of fine blood-vessels. When these ossify or turn to a bony condition, the brain is said to lose its elasticity, and it is no longer flexible. Ideas become fixed. The old man cannot change his views. He is stubborn, mulish, obsti\u00ac nate, and can see but one idea, and that is the first that comes to him on every subject. A brain specialist knows perfectly well when the brain of a patient is hardening or turning to bone. The slang term, bonehead, has much more truth in physiology than its users imagine. The most direct enemy of the ripening process is distilled water. This may be had in the form of rain, or in the form of condensed steam. Vapor rises from land and sea, makes clouds and condenses to fall in the form of rain. That is nature's dis\u00ac tillery. Exactly the same process occurs when water is boiled and its vapor is thrown off in the form of steam. This, when con\u00ac densed, becomes distilled water, and is just the same thing as rain water. In rising vapor or steam, impurities do not leave the body of the water. They remain behind as dregs. The vapor from the salt ocean is not salty. The steam from salt water is not salty. If there are impurities and foul contents in water, its vapor would not take them along. Thus nasty, filthy water, when distilled, rises pure in the form of steam, while the dregs, or leavings, are nastier still. Nature was looking out for the health of man when she made this remarkable law that only pure matter will rise in vapor. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 31 There is a home where four generations have lived and drank water from a well that is charged with lime. There are young and old in that family today, and they are each and all aged beyond their years. Nearby there is a home where four generations have lived and drank rain water stored in a double cistern. The present generation are younger looking than their years; the grandmother being rosy of face and bright of eye, giving the appearance of a woman of thirty-five. People who use long-standing boiled water grow old beyond their years. They have the bad habit of putting tea on the stove in the pot, and allow it to simmer day in and day out; adding more water, but not throwing out the grounds as they desire their full value. They are drinking dregs of water; as the vapor that boils away is the only pure or distilled part of it. Some people let a tea kettle boil away hour after hour, and then use the water that remains. The good has gone out in the form of steam and vapor, while the dregs remain; and it is the dregs that hold the poisons and mineral excess that cause old age. We knew a family where all the members were old looking, when in fact they should have appeared ten to twenty years younger; and we dropped in to ascertain the cause. We found two causes in fact. One was a boiling kettle that sent forth a merry stream of vapor, and which was replenished from time to time by the woman. The water was hard enough to begin with; the many additions brought more hardness, while the vapor took away all that was good. Yet that woman used the dregs of the water to cook with and to make tea and - coffee. No wonder the family were aged beyond their years. The practice of allowing a coffee pot to stand all day on the stove simmering, while new water is added to take the place of the old, is a prolific cause- of quick aging. Another similar cause is the custom of allowing soups and broths to boil away the distillable parts of the water and meat juices, while the dregs of both water and meat juices remain in the pot or kettle. Hospitals, knowing the evils of this practice, use a cold method of extracting the juice from the meat; and they merely heat the extract when they serve it. On the other hand, the cook will allow the water to boil or steam all day long, or hours at a time, and the distillable parts to be. lost in the air, while the dregs are served on the table as food. 32 PERSONAL BOOK No wonder old age comes on fast, and no wonder humanity dies at an average of thirty years, while few persons live beyond a hundred. What are the foods that will preserve yonth in mature men and women ? They are the following: Helps to Prevent Ripening. 1. Eggs from poultry that are given rain-water to drink. 2. Milk from cows that are given the same kind of water. 3. Young meat, if any meat is eaten. The meat of poultry, of game, of lamb, of steers and of any young life is free from an an excess of minerals, for the reason that the food of such life has supplied the growing bones with the hardening material. On the other hand the meat of mutton, old beef, and the like, contains a great amount of mineral matter, because the body has attained its growth in each case, and the excess is kept in the blood and flesh. 4. Raw vegetables, as described in this book. 5. The food fruits, as they have the nutritive value of meats, but lack mineral matter. 6. The juicy fruits. These above all things else will absorb and drive out all excess of mineral matter. 7. Rain water filtered through clean sand. 8. Distilled water filtered through clean sand likewise. How to Keep prom Getting Old. There are several steps in this process, but they are as easy to take as any other duty in life. First, re-build the body by twelve trials in one year, as pre\u00ac scribed in this book. This will remove the accumulated minerals. Second, use the foods of the high standard of living as further described. Third, avoid foods and liquids that contain an excess of minerals. Fourth, avoid dregs in water, in coffee, in tea, and in soups, broths and meat extracts. Fifth, adopt the list above given of the eight helps to prevent the ripening of the body. Sixth, increase the vitality to a high degree. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 33 Chapter Four PREPARING FOR THE CHANGE The things you most desire you must resolve to win: for then each thought and act conspires to reach the end. EVERYTHING that is acquired in this world by effort, must first be desired. In the study of psychic laws it is shown that every person can get what he wants; and the processes whereby he wins against odds is shown step by step. But this book is not engaged in psychic instruction, and the general natural law is sufficient. It is this: Make up your mind what you want; then make up your mind that you will get it; and each day will bring you nearer the goal. A simple explanation of what has been called a wonderful law is this: If you make up your mind what you want, your daily habits will all lean in that direction; and if you make up your mind to get what you want, your thoughts and efforts that other\u00ac wise would drift at random, will be employed in the one direct ehannel of activity towards that end. The brain soon becomes more intelligent along that line of endeavor, just as the man of intense employment in one kind of work soon becomes an expert. It does not require psychic keenness to show how things will surely shape themselves in the right way when your daily habits, your thoughts, your efforts, and your increasing intelligence are all focused on the attainment of one thing. Therefore when the statement is made that you can always get what you want in this world, if you want it hard enough and 34 PERSONAL BOOK make up your mind strong enough, to get it, it may be set down as a truth that cannot be denied. Nature puts human beings on earth for the chief purpose of giving them what they want and what they live for. It is necessary to want something in order to be in harmony with nature; and the person who is not in harmony with nature is inclined to think of suicide. In fact, all that keeps people from thinking of suicide is the hope of something some day that is better than the best things of today. What you were and what you did last year, were not worth living for. What you are and what you are doing this year, are not worth living for. If the coming years contain nothing more than what the past holds, you were better out of the world than in it. Every normal mind, every sane human being, is expecting something and hoping for something that has not yet been at\u00ac tained. This is Nature. Take hope out of human life, and you take the desire of life out of humanity. There must be something to hope for, something to want, something to strive for, something to attain. The desire and the prospect of securing something that allures, play a double part: 1. It keeps a person from brooding and desponding, and is thereby the most potent agency of preventing self-destruction. 2. It sets up an affirmative exhilaration that invites good health, or at least assists in bringing that boon. The last law is exemplified in the familiar case of the woman whose wasting body could not be given health, until she was prom\u00ac ised a splendid trip abroad when she got well. In a few weeks this hope brought results that all the doctors and medicines in the world could not effect. It was exhilaration to her nerves and mind. Not only is depression avoided, and bright health assisted, but the pleasure of living is based on the hope of something to be attained; the desire to wrest victory out of the coming years. Every worthy ambition is a stimulus to mind and body. The man who is a mere repeating machine day after day, and the woman who is a drudge at all times, having nothing worth living for set ahead as a goal to be sought, will fall prey to disease much sooner than the individual whose body is made elastic with the springing hope of better days to come. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 35 \"What is the use of it all?\" is the thought that is constantly knocking at the brain of most every person whose only mission in life seems to be that of fighting hard to keep body and soul together, with a growing impossibility of doing even this much since the greed classes are placing the necessaries of life beyond human reach. It is an age when the mind must be made up to do something. We are all in a stream that admits of no floating, as the cur\u00ac rent is downward. We must pull at the oars and row up the stream where we shall soon come to the uplands of life and see the blessings and glories of the world. The first thing to be done is to resolve to rebuild the human body; to make it over and establish a new Temple in which to live; for this frame is truly a Temple and contains the choicest gift of the universe. As a New Temple it will be given a new brain, a new mind, a new nervous system, new blood, organs and covering; all of the best quality. You may create for yourself a new personality. To do this, to succeed so that your friends will wonder at you and at the change that has come over you, will be an ambition full of hope and bright with the fruits of a grand success. It is something to live for day by day. It is probably the greatest thing in life; for all the victories of civilization are intended to pay homage to the human body; and to rebuild this wonderful Temple is the greatest triumph of all civilization. Let that, then, be your first great ambition; your new found hope. Second in importance, but equally inspiring, should be the desire and determination to conquer the aging elements that begin to take possession of the blood almost as soon as it begins to flow in the veins. The elements that bring on age are the ripening processes of nature. They cannot be forever subdued, but they may be held back until the time comes for the exit out of the world, which should not be made amid the wreck of broken down faculties; but like a last sheep, in the full tide of enjoyment and satisfaction. It is sweet to live like a conqueror. The accomplishment of these two most important things in life will bring many attendant blessings; for perfect health and keen faculties are able to carve a fortune and win power. 36 PERSONAL BOOK Bemember at all times the following facts: 1. Without hope and ambition, life is not worth living. 2. Definite hope and ambition stimulate and exhilarate mind and body. 3. The best goal of life is the building of a new body, a New Temple. 4. The next best goal of life is victory over the aging ele\u00ac ments. 5. Whatever you want, and are determined to secure, you can attain, if you make up your mind in earnest to attain it. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 37 Chapter Five CREATING A NEW BODY When fails the old machine from many mendings worn 'twere best to build anew with thoroughness complete. 0 you want to be some one else? That is the quickest way of getting perfect health. It is also the quickest way of improving the body and mind. If you have a machine that is not up to date, or that has not given you the best satisfaction, you will perhaps get a new part where it is weakest, or you will repair the old part and keep it. Then when some other part gives out or shows weakness, you will treat that likewise. In time you will have nothing but a patched-up machine. Had you at the start got a new one, you would have been better off and the machine would have proved more useful and more pleasing. The same is true of the human body. It was not the best that might have been given you at birth. It was weak and defective. Since then, by the mishaps of life, it has come to prove rather uncertain in one or more of its parts. The heart is weak, and the lungs are far from being strong. The stomach, the liver, the kidneys and the blood are all below the standard needed for this age of rush and pushing progress. The nerves. What about them? They are certainly erratic, or you would not be so irritable. Every little thing worries you, and nothing goes just as you want it to. Weakness of vitality, proneness to get excited or nervous, and a depressing fear of the years ahead when you do not know how you will get a living if something goes wrong in your present circumstances, all serve to 38 PERSONAL BOOK keep your nerves in an abnormal state. You need something diff\u00ac erent. Your brain halts at the great problems of daily life, and fails to make clear to you the dictates of good judgment and sound action. You are not steadily rising in the world, as you would be if you had the breadth and depth of mind necessary for the effort. You are no farther advanced than you were a year ago. A sound mind in a sound body. This is the acme of earthly gifts. Heart, muscles, blood, strength, courage, energy, life, power and achievement are all locked up in the new mind in the new body. It is another in\u00ac dividual that you must become if you would better yourself in the highest degree. Will your identity be changed so that your friends will not know you? This question may be asked many times. We have known of men and women who have built in their brains new minds, new purposes, new ideas, new thoughts and new ambitions; and then they have become as different from their former selves as white is from brown. One man said of his friend and former business partner whom he had not seen for two years: \"I cannot find one trace of Joe. He is as completely changed as if he had become another man.\"\u2014This was the verdict concerning his men\u00ac tal identity. You, if your body is weak, or your health deficient, or you have not the power that you need for your duties, will be more interested in the new physical being that awaits you, than in the mental change. The basis of the new life is vitality. You can discard all your nervous system, and start over again. This feat has been accomplished in numerous cases, and is now being taught in book form for the first time. Make up your mind that you want new nerve-fibres, new nerve-cells, new ganglia that store and hold your energy, and then new life-currents to travel over these many wires and send a brand new stream of living impulses into every tissue and muscle of the body. If you are asked what makes a healthy body, you may say vital life; and some one else may say, pure blood. Others may say, sound flesh; others, strong muscles; others, perfect organs; others fine digestion; others, normal assimilation of nutrition; others, true functional operations; and so on through the list. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 39 It is true that all parts are related to all other parts; but one fails first. There are men with the best of rich blood and muscle, who are deficient in nervous vitality, and we have seen strong bodies fade away under this defect. One man of sound health suddenly collapsed with diabetes, because some one function di\u00ac rectly or indirectly connected with his liver failed without notice. No stomach is sound in the real sense. Because a meal can be digested is not evidence that it is well digested; and when gas ferments in it, or in the intestines, there are poisons generated that may go to the heart in a flash. \" Death from acute indi\u00ac gestion\" is the report in sixty per cent, of all sudden demises at the present day; while appendicitis is no longer a patrician malady. Physicians state that autopsies show, even in cases of healthy persons who are killed by violence, a remarkable lack of health in the stomach and alimentary canal. One doctor who had practiced for fifty years made this assertion: \"X have been present in more than three hundred autopsies, including a large number of persons who had been in what is known as the best of health, and I have never seen a case where the lungs did not show that tuberculosis had been present at some time in life.\" Specialists in lung maladies all say that every man, woman and youth have within themselves the germs of tuberculosis; and only time and circumstances can determine what course they will pursue. For these reasons and for every reason, it is the act of wisdom for you to create for yourself a New Body. Let it be new in every part. New in lungs and heart; new in stomach and alimentary canal; new in all its organs; new in nerves and blood; new in brain and vitality; new in bones and muscles; and let a new iden\u00ac tity be given you so that those of your friends who meet you in later months will not know who you are. Of course where people see you every day or very often, the change, being gradual, does not alter your identity to them. They will notice that a won\u00ac derful improvement is going on in your life, and will be sure to inquire the cause. But those who see you but once a year or so, will need an introduction. The change is steady but powerful. It is complete and effective in every respect. Each step is one that will prove its value as it is taken, and the better feeling will be experienced from the very start. 40 PERSONAL BOOK Chapter Six HOW THE CHANGE BEGINS This part we take away that part is broken down and perfect made material the newer temple builds. L through the centuries men have half guessed at the greatest truth in human life. Once the doctor was called a leech, because he used the leech for sucking the blood from a sick person. Later on he was & lance, because he did the same thing with a cutting instrument. George Washington in his last illness had great quantities of blood taken from his veins in the hope that the impurities would be drawn off and health restored. The leech, or blood-letting doctor, guessed half the truth. His reasoning was partly correct. He believed, and correctly too, that the accumulated material in the body harbored sickness; and he took away as much of it as he dared, in the hope that it was forever removed. But he did not guess the other half of the story. Today the doctor is called the physician because he physicks. He half guesses the truth. Of course he physicks the body in order to draw out of it the defective material that is supposed to give rise to ill health. He reasons that, while the physic reaches directly only the contents of the intestines, their empti\u00ac ness brings much of the accumulated material of the body into the alimentary canal to lake the place of what has been drawn out. This is partly true. Then to assist that process, he sweats the body, and the skin gives up much of the bad material. If you have a severe cold, RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 41 your doctor will give you a purgative, a sweating medicine and something to work on your kidneys. Thus he will have you giving up at all the avenues of escape. It is the same thing in principle. The leech takes the blood, and with it the poisonous matter that the blood contains. The lance does exactly that with the addition that he can draw off more in quantity. The physic, the sweater, and the diuretic all draw off accumulated material that is not desired in the body. Before the leech there was the faster. That was the same in principle. Every religion teaches fast\u00ac ing; and every religion connects health with morals. Christ healed the sick. His work was largely that of a healer. He is called the Great Physician. But long before that period, thou\u00ac sands of years before in fact, fasting was a religious rite as it is today. It was an inspiration. It half reached the truth. The principle all through these treatments is the same. East\u00ac ing proceeds to do some good on the law that as long as there is life in the body, its tissues and all its parts will go on changing by breaking down and passing away. Every minute you live your body breaks down millions of cells that make up its structure and parts. Nothing fails to discard some part of itself. The faster loses in weight just what is broken down in his body. If he is a pound lighter today than yesterday, he has suffered the loss of a pound of his body's material. Some fasters lose from twenty to fifty pounds during the fast. To give up a small quantity of blood, say four pounds, means a great loss of that fluid and some danger to life. But the blood is only the river that is freighted with the material out of which the body is built together with some parts of it that have broken down; while the structural parts of the body are the real parts that are benefited by losses. The better portion should not be wantonly destroyed. The faster has come to us from out of the remotest ages. He is taught by his religion at the beginning, and then is com\u00ac pelled by nature later on to stop eating, so that the bad material that has accumulated in his body may be removed and better health ensue. Wise as is the law of fasting, it is strange that the other half of the truth has never been guessed. Some great good has come from the practice, but on the whole the heart's vitality has been compelled to pay the toll of severe fasting. 42 PERSONAL BOOK This led to the morning fast that was practiced some years ago and that is still in vogue among the few that have not been claimed by death. It was based on the law of blood-letting, of the leech, of sweating, of the diuretic, of physicking; a law that seeks to draw poisonous material from the body; a half-way and half-right method; but as the habit of fasting did the same thing, at the same time lowering the vitality of the body to a dangerous stage, the morning fast was thought a happy compromise. It lessened the amount of food taken, gave the tissue and parts a chance to waste away, and yet did not persist long enough at a time to weaken the heart, as was supposed. But in the history of many cases of morning fasters, or persons who omitted their breakfasts, we found that there followed a desire to overload the system later in the day, which, coupled with the lowered vitality of the heart, brought death to a majority of the people who adopted that regime, including the inventor of it; just as Graham, the inventor of graham bread, died from its use. Everybody who gets a lot of bad material out of the body by the fasting process, feels better for it. This inner cleanliness gives the false hope of permanent improvement. It is a guess at half the truth. Let us look at the facts: 1. The leech takes good and bad blood; and, if much loss follows, there is a shock to the system which the modem heart cannot stand. 2. Blood-letting is the same process as leeching but on a larger scale. The results today would be fatal where a century ago they might have been merely weakening. 3. Physic proceeds in a better way, as do the kindred pro\u00ac cesses of sweating and giving activity to the kidneys. These are in vogue today. They weaken the body, but do not attack its bulk of defective and poisonous material. 4. Fasting deprives the body and its functions of food and fuel, compelling it to use up some of the material that has been accumulated. This material becomes fuel in place of food. Every part loses something, and is not renewed until food is again taken. The body is burning up its debris and junk. This is exactly what nature does when she sets a fever going. During the fever, she demands that fasting occur; and thus she gets rid of the bad material in short time. If the patient survives the crisis of the fever, and the nurse knows what to feed the body during conva- RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 43 lescence, the malady will prove a blessing. In a garden, weeds compel cnltnre without which there could be no results worth while. When the human body is filled with bad material and the individual will not take steps to get rid of it, death will ensue unless nature steps in and sets the debris on fire. For this purpose many germs are created to light the fire. There are many kinds of fever. But the purpose of nature is seen in them all. She burns up the dangerous accumulation, during which process she forbids the use of foods. There are days in every fever when the patient can retain nothing on the stomach. When the latter is right for food, then hunger sets in. Here is a double process that beats anything man has invented. Fasting keeps out the new material, and fever burns up the old material in great haste. It is dangerous, but it is necessary unless man will act for himself. As in the world of plants, of flower, fruits, trees and valuable animals, man has applied his wonderful faculty for making use of natural laws in winning the laurels of new achievements, so nature expects him to find something better than fever and fasting for cleaning out his body and making a new self. Yet fevers make some remarkable changes in people. We recall the case of a young man who was painfully thin until he had typhoid fever at the age of twenty-two; and after he got well he took on good flesh, got rather stout but not fat, and was so different that his own college mate, seeing him afterwards, became angry because he was told who he was and would not believe it; he thought he was being imposed upon. In our earlier books of twenty or more years ago we refer to many cases where fever has left the body wholly different. The old material has been removed and the new material has been better than the old. A doctor says this: \"If you ever have fever, begin anew with your body building. The chances are that you will lose much flesh in the fever; new flesh will be built; and here is the opportunity for building it well.\" That is guessing or rather reaching the other half of the truth. The loss of blood from any process in the olden times should have been followed by extraordinary care in replacing it. Even when the body is physicked today, and cleaned out by sweating and diuretics, care should be taken to renew its material with the best foods that can be found. 44 PERSONAL BOOK The same is true of fasting. Take, for instance, morning fasting which has made so many persons feel better for awhile and then suddenly die of heart failure. It threw some bad material out of the body; but no attempt was made to supply something better at the next meal; nor was the loss of one meal sufficient to break down any substantial part of the body. It relieved the clogging from overeating the night before. Likewise the same law holds true of long fasts such as are now being taught by sensational health-writers. They do in fact clean out the body; but they are not followed by a better class of food. One-half the truth has been known for thousands of years: the breaking down of bad material in the body. The other half is now at hand; and it is the renewal of the body with perfect material. If bad material must be taken out, why bring back its like again? If the timbers of your house are decayed, take them out and bring in the best timbers you can procure. That is sen\u00ac sible. A man who had fasted for a week, began to eat anything and everything he chose, with the result that he needed another week's fast right away; while another man who fasted a day, renewed his loss with first class material and is in perfect health at this time. What you are is determined by what you eat. If you build a jewel of gold it will be gold when done. It will not contain diamonds if no diamonds entered into its con\u00ac struction. You cannot eat one kind of food and be another kind of man. The pork-eater shows pork in his face, in the skin of his body and in the eyes. The man who has fed on clean grains gives evidence of the cleanliness of his body. A man is what he eats. Nature allows a large margin in waste material and bulk out of which the stomach and canal may select the nutrition required to sustain life. But what actually is assimilated, makes the man, and even affects his disposition. Experiments made in thousands of cases during many years, prove this fact. Every part of the body is breaking down every minute. This change is going on from the first moment of life down to the last breath. Change never ceases. Nature completely rebuilds the body, but it takes time except when fever is present. Fasting without fever merely uses up the RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 45 body's material instead of having food to use in carrying on the functions and activities. If your body takes in as much food each day as it loses, the result is that the supply equals the demand, and no draft is made on the accumulated material; but if it uses up more fuel than the food contains, the result is that a draft is made on the stored material. If no food comes into the body for twenty-four hours, there is sure to be a large draft on the stored material. As activity assists in breaking down the stored material of the body, a day of physical tax for persons who are strong enough to endure it, will assist nature in this process. The great dis\u00ac advantage of exercising is that it breaks down bad and good structures alike and does not replace either. To aid in removing the bad accumulations from the body, a special absorbent of effete matter should he taken copiously; and this is distilled water. It travels all through the body, omitting no part, and picks up everything that does not belong there. Under the system of the Personal Book the following steps are required to create a new body: First Step:\u2014\"One day's withdrawal of food.\" This means that no food of any kind is to enter the body for thirty-six hours. The withdrawal begins after the evening meal of one day, continu\u00ac ing through all the next day and night, and may be broken at the morning meal of the third day. This is really the omission of three meals. Second Step:\u2014\"Activity.\"\u2014There should be as much activity as the person is able to endure easily without undue weariness. The strength must not be taxed. It is better to take eight hours sleep on the two nights between the meals. Third Step:\u2014\"Absorbent.\"\u2014Beginning as soon as the stom\u00ac ach is empty, which will be about two hours after the evening meal before the withdrawal of food, drink distilled water, or else pure rain water, at a cool temperature. The water should be prepared in accordance with the rules stated in a later part of this book under the title of water. One quart of this should be drank slowly and at brief intervals in the evening or night; then the next morning another quart should be drank before the middle of the forenoon; a third quart before the middle of the after\u00ac noon; a fourth quart during the second evening or night; and a fifth quart the morning following before anything is eaten. 46 PERSONAL BOOK The purpose of taking the distilled water is to pick np all dead and bad material in the blood and tissue and through all parts of the body. This with the fasting will quickly remove a large part of the accumulated matter and prepare the way for the next step which is that half of the process that is and has been for thousands of years wholly ignored. Fourth Step:\u2014\"New Material.\"\u2014When three meals have been omitted as stated, then on the morning following, great care should be taken to introduce the purest and most wholesome material into the body; for the latter will quickly assimilate it, and the whole character of the new creation will depend on the things that enter into its construction. Here is the turning point in civili\u00ac zation. In all the thousands of years that have passed during which people have lost their old bodies part by part, by fasting, by fever, by blood-letting, by leeching, by purgatives and by sweating, no one has thought to build new ones with perfect material. It is true that the patient who is getting well is told to be careful as to his diet, and he eats certain safe foods for a while; but no attempt is made to create a new body on the breakdown that has taken place. The diet of the convalescent is weak and designed for the sick room only; not for the strong man and woman. This turning point in civilization has the following features to be well considered and kept in mind: 1. The removal of the present body is accomplished without the weakening effects that attend fever, purging, fasting and the other methods so well known. 2. The creation of a different body that is to follow the present body, is based on the selection of the perfect material that nature affords to those who make the proper choice. 3. Accompanying these two processes, a new fund of vitality, known as Htt&lSItfr/ is supplied in a volume of power never before attempted by any system. 4. It is to sustain this remarkable plan of a new creation that the present Personal Book is issued. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 47 Chapter Seven NEW LIFE The world is brim full of good things given by nature for the joy and happiness of every earnest human being. attempt is made to introduce a special line of foods. Under some systems, you will be required to bunt up and buy certain things that are different from what you have been using; but the Ralston Health Club has no need of such specialties. In fact, it has been shown that the staple products of nature that have been in the household regime for all time, contain among themselves the per\u00ac fect material that is needed. The special diet is generally weak\u00ac ening. A person might be benefitted for a while by nuts and other concentrated food; for any change may be helpful as it relieves the body of its errors; but a weak after-condition follows, if persisted in. The modern doctor, if he is skilful, takes a start in the right direction. He seeks to repair the blood and the membranes. He knows that the life of the body originates in the membranes; and that the vitality arises in the nerve-centres; while the renewal of the body is made by the blood. Hence the following table: 1. Life is in the Membranes. 2. Vitality is in the Verve Centres. 3. The Blood renews the body. 4. Life is the act of living. 5. Vitality is the energy that sustains the act of living. 6. The Blood is the river that brings new material and takes away old material from all parts of the body. 48 PERSONAL BOOK 7. The Blood, therefore, is the builder. 8. It is not enough that the body exists; it must live, and in living it must carry on many kinds of activities. The synonym for life is activity. 9. Existence would be useless if there were no activity. 10. To sustain existence, there are organs in the body that keep active day and night. If one of them should stop at any time, death would ensue. These are called functions. They are involuntary forms of activity. They are kept going by the life in their membranes, for every organ is run by a membrane which furnishes it with vitality, and with a fluid that exerts a controlling influence on it. 11. All other forms of activity are set in motion by the faculties which are directed from the brain, and this organ is surrounded by membranes that feed it with power and impulse for all its work. When a thought comes into the mind, the inner membrane is moist and the fluid that gathers there has a mutual action with the nerves that enter the brain. This is the thinking process; and, if the idea is stored away for future use, it becomes also an act of the memory. 12. There are then two kinds of life: First, the functions of the organs; second, the faculties of the whole body as directed and controlled by the brain. The functions go on by themselves, like a clock that is wound up at birth or before, and that runs down when its mainspring has no more power to drive it. The faculties are run by thought, or by habits that originated in thought. 13. The engine of the body is its organs. 14. The body itself, apart from its engine and power, con\u00ac sists of bones, muscles and flesh. These are the only portions that can be lost or removed without causing death. No organ or membrane can be spared; except that one kidney, a part of the lung, part of the stomach and part of the liver may be dispensed with for a while, but with great disadvantage to the rest of the body. But a leg, an arm, an ear, or any part not in the engine, may be spared without causing serious loss of health. 15. The engine of the body consists of the brain, the lungs, the heart, the liver, the kidneys, the alimentary canal adjuncts, and the skin; the latter being a covering of the most powerful little engines in the world, when their size is considered. Their duty is to force out a vast flow of poisons that are left by the RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 49 blood just under their surface where the millions of pumps are placed. 16. The Temple of man may therefore he summed up as follows: a. The body itself, including flesh, bones and muscles. b. The engine that drives the body, consisting of the organs and their membranes. c. The engineer, consisting of the mind and its brain. d. The power, consisting of nervous energy, which is an electrical force. 17. The faculties are directed by the engineer, the brain. 18. The functions of the organs which go on night and day of their own motion, are driven by nature. She wound up the clock at the beginning of life, and woe to that part of her mecha\u00ac nism that stops, even once! Listen to the heart. It knows no rest. It may skip a beat, but the ceaseless pulsation goes on, not for a minute, nor for an hour, a day, a week, a month, a season, a year, a decade; but until the power runs down. 19. Nature also winds up the nervous coil, and fills the batteries with the charge; then makes it self-filling; and leaves it to run out of itself when neglected or worn away. From these batteries she carries wires to all the membranes, to all the organs, to all the bones, muscles and flesh; and the absence of a live wire in any part means paralysis of that part, just as the running out of the whole charge means total paralysis and instant death. 20. Here is the process of living: a. Nature supplies the charge to the batteries. b. By wires she carries the charge to the membranes. c. The membranes diffuse the charge to the organs. d. The brain, being one of the organs, receives its charge in the act of thinking, or in its habits, and it directs the charge to the muscles. The latter move the bones and flesh, and so the faculties are given their activity. e. The batteries are the cells at the nerve-centres; and the wires are the nerves. A body that is paralyzed is dead; a part that is paralyzed is useless. There\u00ac fore the batteries and their wires, meaning the nerve- centres and the nerves themselves also, must be kept alive and full of vitality. 50 PERSONAL BOOK 21. Vitality is the most important of all the qualities of the body and its health. 22. This vitality, while it is stored in the central cells of the nerves, is generated by the membranes. These parts do a double work: they create electricity and send it to the nerve-cells; and they receive it back as needed, and diffuse it among the organs. 23. In the waste of the body that attends fasting, or blood\u00ac letting, or purging, or fever, the membranes are the first to break down; and in the repair they are the first to be made anew. This is necessary in order to hurry the renewal of the lost vitality. In every healthy woman the uterine membrane breaks down completely every month and is wholly lost by sloughing off, while a new membrane comes to take its place. This shows the way in which nature acts. 24. Albumin is the direct and perfect material for creating a new surface of any membrane. This fact is of value in the healing of a sore throat, or a weak bronchial passage, or a stomach that has been injured by poison or indigestion. It repairs the hurt walls of the intestines. The lung-cavity, which is held in the great membrane, is relieved of its congestion by albumin. Singers who suffer from laryngitis, hold the white of an egg in the throat until it is all absorbed in the buccal glands; and the injured membrane is healed, sometimes slowly, but surely. Asthma has been better controlled by this treatment and deep breathing than by all the medicine that have ever been used for that malady. 25. The food of the membranes, therefore, is albumin. 26. As a wasting away or removal of a part of the body by any process, leaves the membranes weak, and as they are the first to require repair in order to maintain the highest state of the vitality, the first food taken after the loss, must be the white of an egg. The scientific removal of a portion of the body by the methods set forth already, will be continued after the evening meal of one day, through all the next day, and up to the morning of the third day, which is the loss of only three meals; then the first breakfast must be as follows, assuming that the distilled water has been taken as required. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 51 The First New Breakfast. When the water has been taken, let the white of a fresh egg that is very cold, be sipped and held in the throat for a short time, and then slowly swallowed. Wait a minnte or two, and take the white of a second egg egg in the same way. In five minutes or so, take a glass of milk in which the white of the third egg has been broken and thoroughly mixed. But the milk must be sipped very slowly. Milk never should be poured into the stomach. It was not made for that use, and can never be nutritious if used as a drink instead of a food. The first new breakfast will have consisted of the whites of three eggs and a glass of milk. All this will be absorbed and actually assimilated in the body; a thing that has never before occurred in your life since you were born. There will be an eager hunger of the membranes for the food; the vitality will flow rapidly into the nerve centres; and back from them will come a current of electrical life, the strongest you have ever experienced. You have removed a goodly proportion of your bad body; and you are creating something new and perfect. During the forenoon take distilled water in plenty, not less than a quart; and nothing else; then come to your First New Dinner. It is not a real dinner; but is called so after the old-fashioned idea that everything you eat at noon time is a dinner, however small or great. The first thing is the white of an egg, sipped as in the morn\u00ac ing. Then the white of another egg sipped in the same way after a wait of a minute or two. Then the white of a third egg in a glass of milk, which must be sipped very slowly. Then a slice of old white bread, toasted to a nice brown, and broken in small bits into a second glass of milk without egg. This must be sipped slowly and not in a hurry. If you are hungry after this and are sure you can relish a second slice of toast, take it in as much milk as it will soak up; but take it slowly. 52 PERSONAL BOOK The milk should be fresh, and brought to steam heat but not boiled; then it should be made cold by placing it in ice. Do not put any ice in the milk. If you wish iced milk, add some salt to the cracked ice that is packed around the receptacle in which it is placed, and the milk will form some ice in itself, which will be safe to use. But melted ice is dangerous at all times. Safe ice water is made in the same way. Ice made of milk is called \"milk ice.\" First New Supper. The evening meal is to be merely a repetition of the noon meal. There should be a quart of distilled water drank in the afternoon. In the evening enough distilled water to quench the thirst should be drank, taking a little at intervals. Second New Breakeast. On the morning of the next day the breakfast should be pre\u00ac ceded by the drink of distilled water, between a pint and two pints being enough. The breakfast should consist of the following: A soft boiled egg, with the white not hard. To this add enough butter and salt to make it palatable. Take two slices of old bread toasted, and break them into the egg, or else mix the egg with small pieces of the toast; having in the first place buttered the toast. A glass of cold milk sipped very slowly through the meal. If still hungry, take another soft boiled egg with more toast and a second glass of milk sipped slowly. When food is taken slowly, three or four times as much of it is assimilated, as would be if it is taken in the usual manner. Thus an egg and broken bread, if absorbed for the most part by the glands of the mouth and then swallowed, will amount in food value to all the nutrition you can get from a two dollar dinner It is not what is eaten, but what is drawn into the structure of the body that counts real value. If you eat more than the body will absorb, the excess must be thrown off by the vital powers, which is a severe tax on those powers. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 53 Vitality is saved by not taxing it in the work of getting ont of the system a mass of food that cannot serve it. As vitality is being generated all the time, the quickest way to build up a great fund of such power is to avoid wasting and overtaxing it. Like magnetism, it accumulates rapidly when you stop its loss. Our work at this stage is to prescribe just enough food to supply the needs of the body and not to allow a surplus. The result will be a quick growth of new vitality. Second New Dinner. This will consist of the following parts: A glass of milk into which a whole egg has been whipped. In this break small bits of old bread toast. Eat them slowly. A baked potato that is very mealy. Open it and spread it out, keeping the peal with it. Cut the latter into very small pieces. On the whole potato, pour some milk and enough salt to season it well, getting plenty of salt, but not too much. Eat it slowly. If still hungry repeat the potato part of the meal, by fixing a second one in the same way. Be sure the potatoes are mealy. Second New Supper. The noon meal should be repeated. In addition to what has been prescribed, take junket or corn starch pudding. If the latter is chosen, eat either milk or cream on it, but no sugar. Do not touch anything else. Follow this system carefully if you wish to see results. You may be tempted to eat pastry or something fried; but remember that nothing will so quickly break up the blood as crisp food. You are seeking to make a new body, not ruin the one you have. The Next Day. The next three meals should be the same as the last three just described. This will end the building process, for as much material will have gone into the body as the withdrawal of the three meals removed. There have been now nine meals taken. 54 PERSONAL BOOK Following these nine meals the diet is to be based on the general plan of this work, as will be described in the chapters to come. Thus there are two divisions to the plan of creating a new body: First.\u2014The nine meals just described make the first division. Second.\u2014In all life that follows there should be a High Standard of Living. All that is found in the remaining parts of this book, make up that high standard. But one trial of the methods that have already been set forth is not enough. You should repeat the whole process once a month for twelve months; and in that time all the old body will have been brought into the control of the new conditions. Assuming that you will make this effort in the manner and at the times stated, we will proceed to unfold the high standard of living in the coming chapters. As life depends on vitality to originate and sustain it, the study of the sources of vital energy must be given place in this work. Food alone is not enough. Likewise the personal needs of each man and woman must be measured and met as individual necessities, not as subjects of fixed rules or diet. This shows a four-sided system as follows: 1. The methods that change the body. 2. The high standard of living. 3. The development of vital life. 4. The personal needs of each man and woman. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 55 Chapter Eight FIRST BUILDERS No accidental law or blind established rule bestowed the wondrous gifts that wait at every hand. HEN the body is ready for its new material the power of knowledge comes into play to guide it aright. As has been shown, many times the body is relieved of its defective material and is then fed with other de\u00ac fective material which defeats the attempt of nature to build it better than it was before. Two rules should be kept in mind: 1. Some of the things that are eaten as food, are not food. 2. All the wholesome articles of food may he so prepared or combined as to become injurious. This requires two acts of the judgment to pave the way for the right kind of builders: 1. Proper food must be adopted at all times. 2. The proper methods of preparation and combination should be employed. Fully half of the money spent in the household, goes for things that are not food, or that contain very little of food value, or that are are partly composed of poisons. Even when proper foods are purchased, they are too often deprived of their nutrition by the way they are prepared. It is thus seen that the search after health joins forces with the reduction of the expenses of living. When good money is wasted on bad food, or when it buys good food that is badly prepared for the table, the earning power 56 PERSONAL BOOK that brings such food into the house or that pays the bills, should stop to consider a road to a remedy. If fifty per cent, of the money is uselessly spent, it deprives the family of many hundreds and thousands of dollars in the course of years; money that is needed for comforts that are denied, and money that old age wants when the poorhouse looms up over the horizon. The highway to good health is the least expensive of all ways, and is lined on both sides with more pleasures than any other road that has ever been traveled. It costs less, and brings greater happiness. The two divisions are simplicity itself: 1. Remove from the body its defective material. 2. Build the body with perfect material. The latter is to be found in the two classes of foods men\u00ac tioned; those that are properly selected; and those that are properly prepared. Such foods are called Builders. The first of these Builders will now be considered. POTATOES. These are the white potatoes. As a food they are capable of almost sustaining life. The body must have certain elements; and what are lacking in white potatoes may be found in drinking water and pure air, so that a person can really live on nothing but potatoes if they are prop\u00ac erly selected and properly cooked. Like everything else they may be improperly selected, and like everything else they may be ruined in the manner of being cooked. There is a case of a woman living to be over one hundred years of age who ate nothing but white potatoes for the last forty years of her life, as her own relatives testified; and she claimed that in the earlier years she had but little else. Water was her only drink. She had berries, and other fruits whenever she could get them, but not very often. There are thousands of able bodied men today who live practically on potatoes, and they are in the best of health. These facts are not cited to make it appear that we advocate a potato diet. We believe in variety to a certain extent. We would never recommend the potato as the only good food to be found. But it holds high rank, and combines qualities that can- RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 51 not be found in other things. It is vegetable and cereal, for it contains the material of vegetables, and the starch of t e grains. While bread has a value of the highest rank, it is constipating, and concentrated; but the potato is exactly what the intestinal canal needs; it is not constipating and is not concentrated. But it must be in good condition. Owing to these facts, it was the opinion of the doctors at a large meeting recently held in this country that, if hut one article of food were to be chosen on which to base good health and longevity, the white potato would be given that choice. In considering this product of the earth, let us apply the two rules that have already been referred to: 1. Select proper food. 2. Prepare it properly. In selecting potatoes the following facts must be kept in mind: 1. A new potato must not be too new. The skin should be slightly flaky to show that it is ripe. Most new potatoes are eaten unripe, or at a stage of ripening that has not fully burst the starch cells, and the result is that the nutritive value is greatly lessened. 2. A potato must not be green, even on one side. The whole potato should be discarded. This green color comes from exposure to the sun which converts the food value into a poison. 3. A potato must not be waxy. Old potatoes become waxy and are not only not helpful as food but do actual injury to the body by settling up organic diseases. 4. A potato should not be eaten after it has been allowed to make sprouts. There are ways of keeping a new, fully ripe potato in a new condition, so that it will retain for more than a year its good qualities. Some farmers know how to do this. Any Ralston Community should take up this matter and secure all the year round the best condition of this kind of food. Under the rule of proper selection we have four facts as guides. In the study of preparation we come to other facts that are equally as important. We will assume that you have learned how to select the right kind of white potatoes, and that now they are to be made ready for eating. 1. The one thing to secure is a mealy condition of the potato. This can come only from one that is fully ripe, and that has not 58 PERSONAL BOOK been allowed to get waxy or soggy. The mealy potato has a high food value. 2. The foremost way of cooking a potato so as to obtain all its great food value is to bake it. No matter how young or old it is, if it will bake to a mealy condition, the skin should be so prepared that it can be eaten with the rest of the potato. It is a mistake to bake the potato so that the skin is unfit to eat. 3. In the skin itself there are food elements that are of the highest value, and that connot be carried so readily into the system in any other way. If a potato is young, the skin is delicious in flavor and valuable as an appetizer. When the potato gets old, the skin can be scraped until the rough outside is thinly removed; but even this is not necessary. The more skin that remains on, the better the potato is. 4. Close to the skin in the potato itself, there is the highest percentage of food value; and this is thrown away by the cook. You can go into any kitchen and take the parings from the po\u00ac tatoes and weigh them, and you will be surprised at the great waste. Then analyse them and compare the results with an analysis of the contents left in the part of the potato that is usually cooked, and you will find that twice the latter value is thrown into the garbage with the skins; or, in other words, when a man spends a dollar for potatoes, sixty-seven cents of that dollar goes into the parings that are thrown out as worthless. He gets thirty-three cents for his dollar. 5. In the homes of many rich families where economy is not involved, the members have been for some time eating the potatoes with the skins on; and now after a long period of trial their bet\u00ac tered stomachs and improved blood and health prompt them to de\u00ac clare that they would never for a moment go back to the old way of eating potatoes naked. 6. The dislike of potatoes in their jackets is due to two objections: One is the necessary slowness required to eat them; and the other is the toughness of the skins. Slowness in eating is the most natural of all cures for stomach troubles which are now universal; and toughness is an advantage for it gives the teeth and their muscles much needed exercise. The habit of eating only mushy food, cramming the mouth full of it, and tucking it down the throat to urge it along, is the one great cause of defective teeth. If the skins of the potatoes were ten times tougher than they now are RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 59 it would be worth while to masticate them. Dentists are advocating the eating of whole grain to strengthen the teeth. One of the best authorities in the world on the teeth says: \"The only food fit for the race that wants good teeth is the kind that cannot be swallowed without hard chewing.\" 7. The baked potato, jacket and all, is the first great builder of a new body. Get it right and cook it right, and you have something that will do wonders for you when you have paved the way for making a New Temple. 8. In eating a baked potato, it can be dressed with butter an! a little salt added; or it may be dressed with milk and salt; or with cream and salt. The better and more wholesome way is to use milk and salt; but there is not much difference in the value of the results. Gravy is not to be used; but beef juice slightly cooked as a dressing and salted, is highly valuable, especially for a person who is recovering from sickness. 9. If mothers only knew the value of baked potatoes as step\u00ac ping stones from the nursing period to that of regular food-eating, they would be spared many hours and days of anxiety in bringing up their children. One of the first things the young stomach will take and digest, is a baked potato, dressed in milk and a little salt. It can be mixed with a large proportion of milk if relished. The jackets are not to be used with infants until they are able to chew well; and then the laxative effects must be observed and avoided. Soggy or waxy potatoes are decidedly hurtful to any stomach, and especially to that of a child. 10. Boiled potatoes have some value as builders of a new body; but not half the value of baked mealy potatoes. In a boiled potato much of the great body-builder is lost in peeling it. Of course, it is possible to eat a boiled potato with its jackets, but few persons care to do it, while almost everybody soon learns to enjoy the baked potato and its jacket, when deliciously dressed. 11. A boiled potato should be mealy. Some cooks can prepare them in almost any way except the right one. If you are so situ\u00ac ated that you must eat anything that is cooked, no matter how badly it is cooked, you are the most abject slave in the world. When a man pays a dollar for fifty cents worth of potatoes, as many are doing today; and then finds that sixty-seven cents of that dollar has been cut off and thrown out in the parings; and finally gets his sixteen cents of actual value out of the dollar in the form of soggily 60 PERSONAL BOOK boiled potatoes, he needs to fall in love with his wife and win her aid to a revolution in the kitchen. This has been done and is being done every day in Ealston families; kindly, but mighty firmly. When husband and wife come to an agreement the cook, despite her independence which is increased in proportion to her ignorance of the natural laws of cookery, must begin to learn something more than the machine rules of procedure. Let no husband find fault with his wife. Let no wife find fault with her husband. Creep into each other's confidences by the road of kindly inquiry; seeking each other s help and advice. A man who tried to reform his kitchen methods by picking here and there and exposing in an of\u00ac fensive manner the faults that prevailed, finally took our advice and said to his wife: \"Your health is not what it ought to be. My health is not what it ought to be. I do not intend to make any criticism on the cooking. I appreciate the efforts made to prepare the meals. I do not like fads. I do not want any material changes. I would not for the world interfere with your plans; but you and I both suffer from stomach trouble and nervousness. 1 want you to live long and I want to be able for many years to earn the money to make you well and happy. Will you do me the favor to study with me some ideas that may be of value? Will you agree not to turn the matter down until we have gone over it care\u00ac fully? Then I will abide by your decision.\" Some such words would weigh deeply with any woman of sense. It is true that the world is full of silly fads; but Ealstonism has always had the repu\u00ac tation of being the only fadless health doctrine in the world. The Ealston Health Club reflects the most important truths in science and common sense; no more and no less. If you believe in it, never give up because your wife or husband refuses to listen. Learn a lesson from those persistent persons who by their eternal battling have at last won. A single victory does it all; so that a hundred defeats count nothing. Keep at it. That is true character. Learn how to win others to your views. 12. When you come to mashed potatoes, look out. Conceal\u00ac ment is necessary in boarding houses, and is the policy of hotels. A waxy or soggily boiled potato is a candidate for the mashing bowl. If you do not know who mashed it you may take your chances of eating odds and ends cleaned up from the plates of guests and servants of preceding meals, or of badly selected or improperly cooked potatoes. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 61 13. Hashed potatoes are likewise to be avoided. Do you think in these times that any cook who is compelled to economize will throw into the garbage can the leavings of the plates of other people or of the servants ? All that can be served again is brought to the common fund and then put on in some disguise. Look out for dis\u00ac guised food. In it you will get the leavings of dressings, odds and ends of butter scraped from dirty dishes, and all else that can go into the amalgam. 14. The whole potato is about the only thing left in this world that cannot be adulterated by greed, or fabricated by invention. 15. The roasted potatoes that attend the roast of meat, are of some value, provided the skins have not been pared too much away from the surface. By actual measure some potato parings are nearly half an inch in thickness, others more than a quarter of an inch, and few indeed as thin as they should be made; for it takes too much skill and care on the part of the cook to remove the skin in as thin a condition as is to be desired. 16. The thick slices of potatoes fried a very light brown, but not crisp, are suited to winter cooking; but such food is not a builder of a new body. It may sustain the old body and help to furnish strength and vitality; but it has no usefulness in making the old temple over into a new one. The reason is that the high nutritive value is lacking. 17. The crisp friend potatoes are all on the negative side. They tax the system. Many persons can digest them, but at some cost of vitality; and a majority of people cannot digest any crisp surface. Of all the poisonous forms of a good product, the so-called Saratoga chips are the worst. We have made this statement for thirty years, and it has been challenged. A man who boasted that nothing that was served at his hotel could hurt his stomach, tried everything and escaped harm. He challenged our statement, and we asked him to eat potato chips at every meal for a week, taking the usual variety of other food. He wrote back, \"I will eat the chips at every meal as you suggest, and I will warrant that my stomach will be just as strong as ever; after which I will eat noth\u00ac ing but the chips three times a day and thrive on them.\" He reached his third consecutive meal, and was a total wreck from gastritis, from which he died in six months afterwards. A companion of his, died of acute indigestion from eating the thin fried potato chips. In a large boarding house, thirty boarders were emaciated and half 62 PERSONAL BOOK sick from an excess of fried cooking; and, when at last the man\u00ac ager could be induced to omit that class of cooking the stomachs got better. Then the fried methods came in vogue again, and all the boarders became dyspeptics. They left, and new boarders took their places, only to fall victims to the fried food barbarism. The human stomach will not digest any crisp food or surface. The most it can do is to get rid of it after fermentation. There are many persons who can keep well apparently on such cooking, but their numbers are growing less every year, owing to the increased tax on their systems by the inrush of adulterations in all things that enter the body. The day of the fried food regime is nearly at an end. Sudden deaths from acute indigestion increased 129 per cent, in the last year. A doctor recently said: \"There are more than a million graves in this land that have been filled by the frying pan.\"\u2014An expert and high authority on tuberculosis said recently: \"Nothing breaks up the blood so fast as pastry and fried food, and nearly all victims of the white plague have been eaters of this kind of food.\" 18. Old and waxy potatoes are sometimes used in imitations. As pearl tapioca is made from such potatoes it should be avoided. The genuine tapioca is valuable as food. In closing this part of the present work a few laws may be stated: 1. The food that will make a strong man sick, will not make a sick man well. 2. The food that will make a sick man well, will give a well man better health. 3. The food that will do harm to a patient who is recovering from illness, and that will not do harm to a well man, will not build up a new body. 4. The food that will furnish strength and vitality to a well man may not build up a new body. Foods therefore have three natural divisions: a. The varieties that will build a new body. b. The varieties that will sustain life but that will not build up a new body. c. The varieties that will gradually weaken life, although they may be eaten safely by a small class of people. We have thus far found one body-builder, which is the mealy baked potato. If your body is made ready for the rebuilding process, then you will find this article of food very helpful; but RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 63 if you have not yet taken the steps necessary to build your body over again, then the baked potato is helpful in determining what to eat to provide strength and vitality. As an illustration of this, a young lady clerk who was in the habit of taking her luncheons out, complained that her stomach was in very bad condition. A doctor recommended the baked potato with milk and salt and a slice of bread and butter. It was a simple and inexpensive lunch, but it brought her back to good health, and a freedom fiom headaches that had troubled her since she had begun to take her meals out. But we do not recommend the one-food diet. A proper and pleasing variety is best. If there are people who do not agree with you as to the value of the baked potato make a measure of their reasons. If they conduct hotels or boarding houses, the baked potato stands in the way of their using up the odds and ends that are left on the plates in the dining room. If their boarders will not eat mashed and hashed potatoes, how can such leavings be used? They are too valuable to the managers to be thrown into the waste cans. We cannot imagine any other class of persons opposing the whole potato. It shows on its face that it is not a made-up dish. When baked it performs a service that has saved lives, and in the feeding of children that have just been weaned it has proved its necessity to the human race. Take one or two daily during the period you are building a New Temple. 64 PERSONAL BOOK Chapter Nine GENERAL BUILDERS From out the crust of earth a teeming wealth proceeds to cheer the heart of man with multitudes of gifts. HIGH standard of living is maintained by the nse of foods and the cultivation of habits that do not weaken the vitality or accumulate defective material in the body. It is now assumed that you have made at least one trial to create a new body; and that, at the beginning of each month, you will make a further trial until you have twelve in all to your credit. This will complete your year. After each series of nine new meals, you should come into the use of such foods as will serve to keep the standard of health at its best. This list will be subject to the personal rules that are to apply to you as an individual. These will follow in their place. In the present chapter the high standard foods are described or re\u00ac ferred to in the following manner: HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING FOODS. 1. Eggs as previously stated. 2. Milk as previously stated. 3. Toast as previously stated. 4. Potatoes as already described. 5. Breads. 6. Cereals. 7. Fruits. 8. Vegetables. 9. Specialties. 10. Drinks. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 65 The above list includes about everything that nature holds or the earth affords. The first four have been fully described in the preceding chapters. We will now discuss the merits of the others. BREADS.\u2014In proportion as the health is poor or the vital\u00ac ity weak, the breads should be old; but a vigorous person may easily digest any new bread that is free from the following ob\u00ac jections : . It must not be soggy or heavy. . It must not be made of chemically impure baking powder or other poisonous ingredients used to raise it. Yeast-raised bread rolls, and like articles, are generally better. Alum is present in most baking powders, and also in most 6elf-raising flours. It is a slow but destructive poison, as it eats the lining from the stomach and intestines, and thus opens the passage to the appen\u00ac dix, which causes appendicitis. c. It must not be fried, or greasy, or in any way connected with fried grease. d. It must not be pie-crusty, as pie-crust breaks up the blood quicker than any other agency. CEREALS.\u2014The best of these is whole wheat free from the bran, cooked long and served with milk, slightly sweetened. RICE.\u2014This cereal when cooked so as to be very light and not soggy, is very valuable when relished. It may be made into puddings or eaten as a vegetable, with butter, or with cream. If either cream or milk is used on rice, no sugar should be taken with it. PUFFED RICE, and also puffed wheat, are both excellent eaten with cream or with milk; but without sugar, unless a very small quantity of the latter is taken with the milk. Sugar mixed with cream causes fermentation and acid. SHREDDED WHEAT eaten in the manner described on the packages is also very nourishing. The last three articles are already cooked and need no at\u00ac tention in the kitchen. They save time and labor as well as fire, and are therefore helpful in the heated season. They include the full value of the wheat. The use of crisp food, as corn flakes, while palatable, is to be avoided, as there is no stomach so strong that it will not in time be sickened by rich conditions in any food. The same is 66 PERSONAL BOOK true of chip potatoes; they have caused many fatal attacks of acute indigestion. SAMP in the cool and cold seasons, as well as hominy and hominy grits, will be found very nourishing and most excellent. If eaten with cream, no sugar is to be used; but if eaten with milk a small quantity of sugar is allowable. Butter is good on it. Breakfast foods as sold in packages, aside from the above, are to be avoided. They are the refuse from mills that are de\u00ac voted to other purposes and that must use up what was once fed to cattle, donkeys and horses. This refuse is now put into flaming boxes and sold at high prices to the public. What is worth a cent or two a pound for animals, now brings ten or twelve cents a pound when fed to human beings. FRUITS are of two kinds: 1. FOOD FRUITS. 2. JUICE FRUITS. Food Fruits are dates, figs, raisins and bananas. Juice Fruits are pears, apples, peaches, grapes, plums, apri\u00ac cots, oranges, pineapples, grape fruit, cherries and berries. The Food Fruits take the place of meat and bread. The Juice Fruits take the place of distilled water; besides help\u00ac ing purify and give tone to the blood. A Food Fruit should be taken under the same circumstances as bread or meat are taken. Juice Fruits should be taken on an empty stomach in the morning; and it does not matter how near or far from breakfast they are eaten. Only the juice should enter the stomach; all pulp should be wholly thrown off; except that the skins of apples, pears, cherries and berries may be eaten, as they furnish valuable food and are medicinal in their nature. Dates, figs and raisins should be cooked or subjected to some method of sterilization, as they may need it. Raisins are par\u00ac ticularly beneficial when cooked, and give as much strength as meat. BANANAS are both bread and meat. Some years ago a well known doctor became an ardent advocate of a banana diet, and he proved the value of this fruit when the following conditions are observed : 1. The banana must be cell-ripe. By this is meant that all green taste must be gone from the flesh, and the cells burst open so that it is mealy, but not old. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 67 2. The skin should indicate the condition of the flesh by be\u00ac ginning to dry up, but not to a great extent. 3. The banana should be taken as the first course of a meal; not after other food has gone in the stomach, and not when the stomach is to remain empty even for a few minutes. If the banana is eaten at the exact stage of ripening and at the time stated, it becomes, next to the baked potato, the best of all the foods that can be eaten. It is foolish to buy meat when a greater value is obtained from this food. A green, or slightly green, or un-mellow banana is dangerous, and may set up intestinal trouble. A few hours of time may deter\u00ac mine a great food or an unsafe one. An over-ripe banana is much better than one that is slightly unripe. There is no food that re\u00ac quires so much exactness of condition as this. GRAPES are the king of all the juice fruits. Some persons eat the skin, but this is not best. Most persons eat the seeds and pulp; and a few grapes so eaten will not do harm unless the stomach is sore. But the juice between the skin and the pulp is the real food of the grapes. As most varieties do not have much juice there, it is better to select such kinds as the white Niagaras, or the black Eatons, which are largely juice, especially the latter. APPLES with the skins, and best of all the baked sweet apples, jackets and all, are both food and juice. But the apple is a treacher\u00ac ous friend. It has fruit cells that are smaller than the point of a fine needle. They can be seen only with the microscope. Each cell is a hollow world, holding inside itself a valuable juice if that liquid has been generated by mellowness of the apple; in which case it is juicy and pleasant. But cooking an apple that is not fully self-mellowed, will separate all these cells, but will not ripen them or burst them open. Apple sauce seems mellow, but it is a mass of separated cells all of which are closed and solid. A raw apple may be eaten and be found juicy, while the cells are solid. It will disturb most any stomach and set up intestinal troubles. A raw, mellow apple whose cells have all bursted by nature never hurt any person unless the acidity was too great. If of the sweet variety, it is a food. Some persons are harmed by apples; others are benefited. The former have eaten the un- bursted cells. The pear is a diuretic and will make the kidneys free. Some pears are indigestible, but most of them are beneficial. 68 PERSONAL BOOK Grape fruit is excellent, if only the watery part be taken. The juice and not the pulp of sweet oranges is good. Sweet cherries that are fully ripe and very mellow are valuable fruit; indeed one of the best of the distilled-water fruits. Strawberries often cause the hives or some form of skin trou\u00ac ble; and lead to neuralgia. They should be eaten with caution. Many persons are not harmed by them. It depends on the condi\u00ac tion of the blood. Gooseberries lead to uric acid troubles, and set up rheumatism, gouty conditions and the like. Blackberries if very ripe and mellow are excellent, as they give strength and value to the body and blood. Currants are in the class with gooseberries; generally hurtful. Blueberries and huckleberries are not injurious. Dried currants are Corinth berries, which name is perverted into currants. They are indigestible. Cake or mince pies made of dried currants beckon a long, bony finger towards the undertaker. Pineapple pulp or flesh is wholly indigestible; yet the juice is excellent, and may be taken with sugar. The juicy fruits should not be cooked. Their value is in their distilled water which is wholly destroyed as such when the fruit is cooked. Sugar also neutralizes the wonderful power of the juices of most fruits, except that of the pineapple, and should be omitted. As the ripening process of the body is checked by distilled water, it is important that all juice fruits that assist in this checking work should be made use of as much as possble. Therefore: 1. Do not cook fruit. 2. Eat fruit without sugar. VEGETABLES are of two kinds: 1. Those that can be eaten raw. 2. Those that can be cooked. When you eat food that is nutritious, it is necessary that the nutrition that is derived from the food be woven into the parts of the body to repair the breakdown that follows the act of living. Even the beating of the heart, the respiration of air, the circulation of the blood, the act of thinking, as well as the operation of the functions and faculties, all cause breakdown, and all must be con\u00ac tinually repaired or the body will waste away. It is a nice balance between loss and renewal of each and every one of the millions times billions of cells that make up the structure of the body. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 69 The nutrition that passes out of the blood to make up the loss of life, and even the process of digesting food, as well as the con\u00ac tinual act of throwing olf waste, must be carried on by messengers and builders, known as good bacteria, or angs. There are two classes of food that are taken daily, or should be taken daily in the body: 1. Foods that contain the angs, or building bacteria. 2. Foods that are nutrition or pabulum for the angs or build\u00ac ers. The first class of foods must never be subjected to heat; for cooking, or any form of sterilization, kills all bacteria, including the angs as well as the devs. Therefore if you heat, scald, boil or sterilize everything that goes into the stomach you would soon be weak in nerves, have bad blood, and rapidly take on the conditions of feebleness in organic life. Complete sterilization means com\u00ac plete death of all the vital elements that are put into the body. Foods that belong to the second class, are those that furnish nutrition to the bacteria of the first class. Nature intends all second class foods to be cooked; not to sterilize them, but to make pabulum of them, and thus fit them for the support of the angs in the body. The fearful mistake made by the raw food faddists was to have both classes of food raw; thus supplying the angs with noth\u00ac ing they could build on or with. If you set a group of masons, bricklayers, carpenters and other artisans to erect a house, you have there the angs; but if you give them nothing to build with, they must starve for material, starve for work, and annihilate each other, else go somewhere else for the means of livelihood. All the second class foods should be cooked; never eaten raw. Here we see the raw food principle on one side of the question. But there is another side of it, the facts of which were not fully known until within a few weeks of the writing of this book. As all food that contains devs, or bad material, or that may contain it, should be sterilized before being eaten, if disease is to be prevented, it follows that such food remains in the form of carcasses in the food itself; and these carcasses must be eaten with the food. Now as the human body requires a supply of angs or good bacteria every day, to cook, boil, heat or sterilize them would result in adding billions more of the carcasses to the food that is eaten. The rule is this: Whenever the foods of the first class, or raw class, are cooked or sterilized, their dead bodies are left in the food itself, and these 70 PERSONAL BOOK are so abundant that they will work serious damage to the system, in time. Still a third fact is now known; and it is this: When any organism dies, or any life is gone forth, what has perished gives out toxins or poisons in the form of gases and vapors, some of which are exceedingly dangerous. The most marked illus\u00ac tration of the quick acting of such toxins is seen in diphtheria which kills the child, not by the invasion of the germs themselves, but by the breath that each germ sends out. So in lockjaw the nerves are convulsed by the poisons set free by other germs. In rabies or hydrophobia, in horrible sufferings that last for days, and end in torture too terrible for one of the world to understand who has not been in the sick room where some strong man, or some noble woman, or some sweet child is paying the most agonizing of all penalties for the indifference of the public in allowing dogs freedom of range; in that saddest of all suffering the toxins do their awful work. If an animal dies in a field and is left to itself, it will be changed back into chemical elements by many kinds of life that will feed on its rot and decay. In fact, rot and decay are processes due to nature in the effort to effect the needed change. If the life that perished is small, it will likewise be reverted to elements and set free; but such alterations cause the escape of toxins or poisons. When bacteria die they also give out toxins. This fact is absolutely proved and known to all investigators of bacterial life. When the bad bacteria are destroyed in food by heating or sterilization, they remain in the food with their toxins; so that such food is not as beneficial as if it had been free from the germs. It contains death. But the first class foods, they that contain needed angs or builders of the body, if cooked or heated or sterilized, are not only deprived of their workers, but are loaded with dead carcasses, and to this danger is added the toxins that are set free on their death. These statements are not theory; they are absolutely proved facts. They have been known for years except the toxin effects following the death of bacteria in the foods that belong to the raw class. Let us sum up the three forms of danger that cooking does to the first class foods: 1. It deprives the foods of their builders. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB n 2. It puts death in the foods in the form of dead carcasses, 3. It sets free the toxins that follow death. Now think of the human body as a temple that must be re\u00ac paired every minute of the day and night; and that builders are required to build and repair. Think then of the effect of killing your builders. This is what you will do if you cook the first class of foods. Then think of dragging into the temple every minute the dead bodies of friends and enemies alike. Finally think of the odors, the effluvia, the rank smells that arise from those dead bodies to foul the air and ruin the place as one of habitation. Here you have the effects of cooking the first class of foods. While other parts give a full description of the classes of foods, it is thought best to list them here to save the necessity of turning to other pages of this book for the information when merely a reference is wanted. The following are the foods that should not be cooked: 1. Lettuce. \u2014 2. Celery. \u2014 3. Young onions when digestible. \u2014 4. Young cabbage when digestible. \u2014 5. Young cucumbers when in very small quantity, and also when the system is clogged; otherwise they are dangerous. \u2014 6. Young radishes, subject to similar restric\u00ac tions. \u2014 7. Berries of all kinds, subject to the restrictions stated in the foregoing lines. \u2014 8. Fruits of all kinds. \u2014 None of the fore\u00ac going articles should be sterilized or subjected to heat or cook\u00ac ing, unless there is disease in the locality, or worms are suspected as in dates and figs. \u2014 9. Tomatoes, if you have no tendency to rheu\u00ac matism. The following are the foods that should always be cooked until they are mealy or free from gummy conditions: 1. Potatoes. This includes only the white or Irish potatoes, as sweet potatoes and yams are not easily digested by any person well or sick. \u2014 2. All fibrous vegetables, such as beets, turnips, carrots, parsnips, old cabbage, old onions and the like. \u2014 3. All young cereals, such as green corn, green peas, green beans, and the like. \u2014 4. All grain, whether whole, cracked, rolled or ground into flour or meal.\u2014Not one of the foregoing foods is intended to be eaten raw. They are the pabulum, or material with which the builders or good bacteria construct the temple of the human body. Until they are mellowed by cooking they are not suited for mankind. Thus the two classes of foods furnish the two forces that are PERSONAL BOOK n needed in the building of a new body wholly different from youi present self. The builders, or raw foods. The material, or cooked foods. It is not every kind of food that is good for the person. The condition of the health and its temperament and occupation has much to do with the selection of the diet. But it is a well proved fact today that some people eat much food and get frail results; while others eat little and are strong. Two rules follow: 1. The more pabulum you eat, the more waste is put into the body and the greater is the vitality that is required to use and dis\u00ac pose of it. You cannot get along without it, as it is the material that is so much needed; nor can a house be built when a surplus of material prevents using what is actually required, by being in the way and blocking progress. 2. The more evenly balanced the raw foods and the cooked foods are; with enough of the latter to furnish the supply needed for building the body, and of the former to act upon the supply, the greater will be your health, and the greater your vitality, for you will secure the required results with the least wear and tear, the least waste and the least amount of food. Try this and see. It accounts for the strange fact that one person on half the amount of food eaten by another person will derive twice the benefit. A man may be a heavy eater and not be well nourished; and another man may be a light eater and be well nourished all the time. And then it must not be forgotten that these rules, which are founded on the supposition that you know what is included in the raw food list, and that you avoid cooking that class, are to be applied to your physical condition. If you are in a laxative state, there is too much of the fibrous material going through your body; too much that is neither in the class of builders or class of material; but dead waste or indigestible matter that merely passes on without giving nutrition to the blood. In such a condition the raw foods may become useless, and having too little material with which to build they may add to your laxative condition. If you are con\u00ac stipated, such things as radishes, cucumbers and cabbage may be taken when they might do harm if you were in a laxative con\u00ac dition. It is true that some persons can eat cucumbers without harm; and it is equally true that cucumbers have quickly ended lives by their action on the intestines. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 73 All sensible persons will go slowly in food selection; first finding out to a certainty what things hurt them, what help them, and what are neutral. This is the result of observation and test. Canned or tinned foods are never useful and they not on y fail to supply proper material to the body, but add the poisons of toxins and dead germ life with which they are loaded. A good Ralstonite never buys or uses canned or tinned goods m any torm, and avoids all package foods. Only such things as are ^tamable in bulk are found in the homes of the true Ralstomtes. And that is evidence of a high degree of common sense. That nature has given care and attention to the needs of the human body is seen in the fact that she has made the stomac 1 of man capable of digesting three classes of food: 1. It is able to digest some raw foods of the vegetable king\u00ac dom and all raw products of the animal kingdom. _ 2. It is able to digest cooked foods of the vegetable kingdom. 3. It is able to digest cooked foods of the animal kingdom. 4. Bnt it is not intended to digest raw foods of the anima kingdom. . 5. ISTor is it benefited by cooked products of the animal king* dom. . . . While there can be no iron-clad rule laid down at this time forbidding the eating of all meats, the time will come when there will be only three classes of foods used by humanity, and they may be summed up as follows: 1. The products of animal life will hold the highest place in the supply of food and will be eaten raw; but no part of animal life itself will be eaten. There is a vast difference between the products of such life, and the life itself. _ Milk, cream, butter, eggs and honey are all products of animal life, but are not animal in any sense, and have none of the faults of meat. 2. All vegetables and fruits that can be eaten raw will con\u00ac stitute the only raw foods of the vegetable kingdom. 3. All the cereals that are useful will be eaten cooked. Here is the trinity of future humanity; clean, wholesome, full of vitality, and destined to a long life and lasting prosperity. 74 PERSONAL BOOK Chapter Ten NO TWO PERSONS ALIKE We differ as the flower is different from its kind Nor heart-beat, thought or mood can all men move alike. NCR, in fact always, it was supposed that health was a mechanical result from a mechanical cause; that # ^ ^ human beings were brought like machines into a normal condition; and that it made no difference what was eaten, as the nutrition would follow in any case. One person is offered something that in a chemical sense is good food, although the recipient does not want it; and another person is given what he wants, so that it is nutritious and not hurtful. The latter individual will thrive, while the former will lack vital power. 4he purpose of food is not to make mere flesh and bone; but to create a vital body. Vitality must be present in the food, and this cannot enter m any instance where it is not invited by a power back of diges\u00ac tion. The stomach is a receptacle that holds the food and churns it in order that every particle will come in contact with some part of its surface. Much of it will be absorbed and passed into circulation by the sponge-like pores of the membrane; but this is mechanical; and it is generally a dry stomach or a catarrhal stomach that so absorbs it. Behind these conditions there is a power known to us as the vital host of digestion. It seems to come to the stomach like a ball of energy. When it comes, then digestion will be perfect and easy and the food will be drawn into the body and create new vitality; RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 75 it will be fully assimilated. There will not be an excess of food to be thrown off by a great nervous effort that breaks down the powers of life. Recent experiments have revolutionized the whole theory of digestion and assimilation. What was not known a few years ago and is now fully proved is the following law: Vital life comes from vital digestion, and this is controlled by the third brain, and not by the stomach. The latter is merely the agent of the former. The third brain is located at the base of the head. It plays the most important part in other functions, as it controls the heart, the lungs, the liver and the kidneys, as well as circulation and all organic activity. That it furnished vitality to the stomach was well known, but that it actually determined what foods should be digested and what rejected, was not even guessed at until a short time ago. This wonderful third brain may make or may cure so danger\u00ac ous a malady as diabetes. A blow on the third brain has caused thousands of such cases. Worry of the mind that weakens this third brain by sapping its nervous centers, causes more cases of diabetes than a blow or strain on the third brain. The fact is that whatever does it injury, is sure to affect one or more of the organs that it controls. All life depends on the nerve-centers. There is a broad and wide muscle that is called the floor of the lungs or the roof of the stomach; its name is the diaphragm. It does the coughing, the sneezing, the laughing and the crying for all persons. If you tickle the sensitive nerve inside the nose, the excitement will reach the third brain, and the latter will order the diaphragm to move violently, first by sinking down, causing the lungs to draw in a quick and deep breath, then by a sudden jumping up which forces the air out through the throat and nose, ending in a great sneeze, the purpose of which is to eject the intruder from the nose. Joy causes the first brain, known as the cerebrum, to exhilarate the third brain, and the latter orders the diaphragm to respond, which makes laughter; for the quick succession of movements of that big muscle makes the air come and go quickly through the throat and mouth; and we laugh. Bad news or worry or depres\u00ac sion, make the first brain so weaken the third brain that the latter 76 PERSONAL BOOK gives a slow action to the big muscle at the floor of the lungs, and there is weeping, moaning and sadness. All vitality is at low ebb. Look at the process of nature: 1. There is the first brain, known as the organ of living im\u00ac pressions that are bright or dark. 2. This first brain makes all its impressions felt by the third brain, and the latter is vital or weak according to the nature of those impressions. 3. \"When the third brain has received its impressions from the first brain, it sends those exact impressions to all the organs that it controls; and the stomach and its powers of digestion will be most strongly affected by them. This process explains why worry has caused diabetes of the fatal kind, and wh}^ the heart beats slower under conditions of melancholy or faster and in better motion when the mind is bright and cheerful. The lungs follow exactly with the third brain. The number of respirations per minute and their depth, depend on the vital brightness of the first brain and its influence over the third. Health and digestion, life and vitality, all originate in the moods of the first brain; and are made real by the power of the third brain over the organs of the body. This great law must be recognized. How if you were asked what causes digestion and health from good assimilation, you would answer, the third brain ? This would be true, for there the control is exercised. But if you were asked what causes the third brain to in\u00ac fluence the making of health through digestion, you would say the first brain or what is in fact the intelligent brain; the brain that knows and acts upon its knowledge, and that masters the opera\u00ac tions of the body through the functions. It may be dry reading to say that the third brain is the master of the involuntary opera\u00ac tions of the body, which means the functions; and it is under the influence of the first brain; while the second brain masters the faculties, which are the voluntary operations of the body; the sec\u00ac ond brain being under the mastery of the first brain. So it is seen that intelligent thought and feeling may master both the functions and the faculties. The functions, being the duties performed by the organs, go on at all times, night and day; so that sleep is often a relief from the depressed moods of the first brain, unless there are troubled dreams. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 77 The first brain is bright or dark as its knowledge is cheering and its moods are exhilarating, or the opposite conditions prevail. What is back of the first brain? Does it have any earthly master? If not, then it must be the prey of all influences, now flighty and now gloomy. But if it has a master, what and where is it? There is the most absolute proof that a master exists, and that this master is the soul in the mind and body. It need not necessarily be the immortal soul that belongs to another world, but that there is a distinct being of a personal nature, that is able to sway the first brain at will, is proved in the gigantic volume known as the Operations of the Other Mind, or Soul, which is the Personal Master of every man and woman. This is fully de\u00ac scribed in the booklet called Honor Values, which is allotted to every member of the Ralston Health Club without cost, as stated in the final department of this book. But it is not material for the purposes of this work to know whether or not the first brain has a master that can compel it to do its bidding. It is sufficient to know that the processes of digestion and health depend on the condition of the third brain. If the nose is irritated by dust or mucus the command is wired to the third brain to set the big muscle at the floor of the lungs to work. Here is the sequence of action: 1. The cause. 2. The response of the third brain. 3. The action of the organ it controls. 4. The removal of the cause, which is the result sought. Digestion proceeds along the same route. 1. There must be the exciting cause. 2. Then the third brain will respond. 3. The stomach will receive the fluids that carry on digestion. 4. The result desired will be attained, which is the assimila\u00ac tion of the nutrition into the general circulation. IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT THE EXCITING CAUSE OCCURS IN THE MOUTH. By the word mouth we mean all its cavity and the upper throat .that holds the food until it is swallowed. . It was always supposed that the stomach fluids were called into the stomach by the presence of anything in that organ; and it is only very recently that the truth has been ascertained. The 78 PERSONAL BOOK great man who proved the real process, received the prize from the Nobel Fund, a sum of cash so large that its income alone will support several families indefinitely. Here are some of the facts that came to light: 1. The presence of anything in the stomach will not draw in the fluids of digestion. 2. Without these fluids there can be no digestion. There may be mechanical absorption, but no vitality or new life will follow. 3. The old theory was that anything that entered the stomach would excite its walls and thus call in the fluids of digestion. 4. It was even thought and taught that the scraping of the inner walls of the stomach would induce this flow of fluids. 5. The school books taught that the stomach, when empty, had no gastric juice, but was dry, and that only after food came in did the fluids come to act upon them. 6. The walls of the stomach were actually tickled with a feather, but no fluids entered. _ Then the roughest and sharpest kind of sand was inserted against the inner walls, yet the stomach remained perfectly dry. 8. Real food was now inserted through the abdominal opening into the stomach. Bread and the coagulated white of hen's egg, lay for hours in the organ and no digestion took place. Raw meat, after a long period, started a very slight flow of the diges\u00ac tive fluids, but there was no actual process that could be called digestion. The uncooked white of an egg passed through the porous walls of the stomach, but this was an absorption, and not digestion. No gastric juices were present. 9. Now by one of the most ingenious experiments ever made, the full flow of gastric juice was secured without allowing any food to enter the stomach. This was done by cutting an opening in the lower throat, and dividing the food passage into two parts\u00b0, so that food put in the mouth may be drawn away before it can be sent to the stomach. It was naturally swallowed, but did not get any farther. The food selected was of a dainty kind, and was desired. As it was taken away from the gullet after it was swallowed, it was caught in a pan and eaten over and over again. 10. The greatest of modern facts is this: Although not a morsel reached the stomach, the gastric juice poured into that or\u00ac gan in enormous quantities. The saliva at the mouth was free. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 79 Enough of this saliva and of the gastric juices of the stomach were collected and used as solvents on other food, and was found sufficient to digest several large meals. It is on the same princi\u00ac ple that hospitals use hydro-chloric acid to digest meat without having to boil it or lose the good in the vapor. 11. It was afterwards found that, if there was great hunger, a very low grade of food would start the flow of these stomach fluids which are known as gastric juices. Foods that ordinarily would be rejected by a person supplied with tempting varieties, will attract these fluids to the stomach, as soon as such foods are placed in the mouth. 12. Then came the further facts: The degree of hunger de\u00ac termines the amount of flow, and the power of digestion. Food that a weak and indifferent stomach would not digest at all, would be the easiest of all things for the keenly hungry stomach to digest. More than this the sight of food, the odor of its flavor when pleasant, and the prospect of an enjoyable season at the table, all impel the flow of stomach fluids, and make digestion and health certain. In summing up the great work of the experimenter. Prof. J. P. Pawlow, we will use his own words: \"The presence of diges\u00ac tion furnishes a beautiful illustration of the influence of mind on matter.\" \u2014 \"The inspiring stimulus is not mechanical, but psychic.\" \u2014 \"The preliminary essential to an orderly assimilation of food is a keen desire for it.\" \u2014\"The passionate longing for food and this alone has called forth under our eyes, a most inter\u00ac esting activity of the gastric glands. * * * We are therefore justified in saying that the appetite is the first and mightiest agent of the vigorous secretion of the gastric juice. * * * There is only one thing to think of, namely, the eager desire for food and the feeling of satisfaction and contentment derived from its enjoyment.\" \u2014 And he sums it all up in the great phrase. \"Appetite is juice.\" When appetite is everything, it should be guarded as the one inspiration to health. The eating of rich pastry, the drinking of sickly soda water and the indulgence in candies, especially when the stomach is empty as is the usual custom with women whose health is never good, seems like flying in the face of nature. When there is a keen appetite, do not abuse it, for then is the golden opportunity to take only the foods of the higher stand- 80 PERSONAL BOOK ard of living which have been already described in this book. The greatest crime against health is eating cheap, or rich foods at a time when the desire for food is strong. Another wrong is the custom of stuffing at a meal; that is, eating more than the body needs, because it tastes good. If you eat slowly and never wash down the food with drink, it will not be taken in excessive quantities. A third wrong is the habit of eating a heavy meal at the end of the day. Food is fuel. Fuel is needed to work on, and not to sleep on. The evening meal, being heavy, is a drag to the system all night, and in the morning there is the clogging fueling that prevents an appetite for breakfast. The man or woman who has no morning appetite, is abnormal, and there is but one rem\u00ac edy: eat no suppers or evening meals until the breakfast hunger is established. This is an infallible sign. The facts set forth in this department are summed up in a few laws: Law.\u2014The health of the body depends on the wholesome ac\u00ac tivity of the stomach juices during digestion. Law.\u2014The stomach juices will not flow in abundance until the third brain acts under the stimulant of appetite and an en\u00ac joyment of the food in the mouth or the prospect of such en\u00ac joyment. Law.\u2014The third brain becomes inactive and refuses to stimu\u00ac late the stomach, no matter how attractive the food may be, if the first brain is depressed. Law.\u2014Food that may lie in the stomach undigested from lack of gastric juices, will be acted upon by an inflow of such juices if an enjoyable condition is set up in the brain. It is this last law that explains why a man who is in the habit of smoking and who is deprived of his cigar or pipe, will suffer from indigestion; which will be relieved by a smoke after a meal. The power of this pleasureable enjoyment on the brain and palate is so great that smoking, if indulged in at all, should never take place until there is wholesome food in the stomach. This fact is not stated to encourage smoking. It is stated merely as a fact. If the habit of smoking is fixed, then the use of the habit should occur only on a full stomach. Kalstonites, as a rule, do not use tobacco in any form. But a habit is a habit, be it good or bad; and there is no reason why a smoker should be sub- RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 81 jected to indigestion, when a good smoke will relieve him. It is a matter of health rather than ethics. The same law holds true of the bad habit of chewing gum. It is a boorish habit at best; but the use of it after eating a whole- Bome meal, will start the gastric juices to flowing and aid the health; while the use of anything in the mouth on an empty stomach will start the gastric juices to flowing just the same, and the walls of the stomach will digest each other to some degree. This fact, surprising as it seems, is well established. While the digestion is slight, it produces irritation and eventually inflam\u00ac mation. Chewing tobacco on an empty stomach will cause the juices to flow, and set up a tendency of the stomach walls to digest each other; just as chewing gum will do the same thing. Sucking candy, or eating anything that does not furnish food for the stomach to act upon, will draw the gastric juices into the stomach, and the latter, being empty, will begin to digest itself. Tripe is stomach, and it is readily digested whether cooked or raw. Water is the only thing that can be safely taken in the mouth when the stomach is empty, for the juices will not flow when water is present. On the other hand the drinking of water while eating, checks the flow of gastric juice. This teaches the law that water should be drank on an empty stomach, or after a meal; but not with it. As milk makes cheese in the stomach, it fur\u00ac nishes bulk and can be acted upon. There are many dainties that can be used to produce diges\u00ac tion after the food has been eaten; and these are often placed on the table to be used between the courses. By pleasing the palate with anything that is keenly relished, a strong flow of gastric juice has been brought quickly into the stomach, and digestion started where otherwise it might have fer\u00ac mented and caused severe illness. While it is much better to eat only the things that are whole\u00ac some, they often fail to tempt the appetite; and it is then useless to take them. Therefore the first rule of all is this: DO NOT EAT WHAT YOU DO NOT WANT. This does not apply to the rebuilding of the body during its first nine meals after the withdrawal of the three meals; for those nine meals make use of certain building foods as medicines; doc\u00ac tors call them food-medicines. They must be eaten in the order 82 PERSONAL BOOK and under the plan stated; and after them, there should be for a while an indulgence in the higher standard foods until the body is clean and well. Then make use of the law that you must not eat what you do not want. You must want what you eat, but it does not follow that you must eat what you want. In the chapter on food selection, the difference between these two laws will be fully stated. Having brought your body into a state of good health, you are then free to choose for yourself. You are not like others. Ho two persons are the same. You are benefited by things that would not be as good for some one else. For these reasons you should make a list of the foods that you most desire and that at the same time most agree with you, and this list should guide you at all times. When it is not pos\u00ac sible to obtain the things that you prefer, have at hand a second\u00ac ary list, and make your selection from that. 1. It is better not to eat than to take something you do not want; unless your mind is weighed down by some great grief, or some influence beyond your control in the usual course of health. If such is the case, come into the Psychic Society under the plan stated in the booklet entitled Honor Values, which is referred to in the final pages of this book. Psychic is the synonym for mind. If the mind will not come into its normal cheerfulness, it should be trained to do so, just as the body is trained. A sad or un\u00ac satisfied mental state is sure to prey on the body and deprive it of its health. 2. In eating what you want, learn to discard the non-food part of your list. People have not yet discovered all the foods that the earth produces, and they have been for centuries eating some things that are not foods. It is necessary to choose the right from the wrong. This is the work of the next chapter. 3. In feeding the body for its highest health, cater to the mind and to the palate; let the palate please the mind, and the mind please the palate. 4. When once you have a kingly appetite, do not abuse it by eating something rich on an empty stomach. This is the com\u00ac mon fault of girls, boys, young ladies, and also of women who are old enough to know that keen hunger, especially late in the day when it is almost ferocious, should not be broken into by something rich like cake, pastry, candy, soda water, ice cream, or RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 83 other unwholesome things. Doctors' bills are sure to follow, and the husband will really believe that his wife is going into a de\u00ac cline when she comes to the table with a sick headache or deli\u00ac cate appetite. If nature so blesses you that you are really very hungry, take advantage of the condition to build a new vitality, for out of normal hunger comes the new health. It is the one golden opportunity of life, and it should not be abused. 5. Bat slowly so that every particle of the food that enters your mouth shall be thoroughly mixed with its saliva; for it has been shown that saliva from a hungry person will, if taken away and mixed with food, start digestion. Saliva is the most heal\u00ac ing of all fluids in nature, when it is normal. It is an antiseptic protection for the throat and teeth; but it must be in that con\u00ac dition that results from a thorough mixing with food that gives keen pleasure, and the food must remain long enough in the mouth to be blended with the mucus in which no water or other fluid has entered. Pood eaten slowly in this manner gives several times more nutrition than food that is swallowed. The eater is satisfied with one-fourth less at each meal. It also saves the loss of vitality by the wear and tear of fighting out of the body an excess of material for which the system has no use. A slow eater may be very fully developed in flesh, and yet eat only about one- fourth the amount of food taken by a thin person. It is not what enters the stomach, but how it enters, that determines the condition of the body that is built from it. 6. Exercise that may invite an appetite, if indulged in at all, should be useful and general. Special drill has the disadvantage of bringing special results only; and then the drill ceases, as it must sooner or later, the results are all lost. It is much better to be usefully active in a normal, average manner that will be\u00ac come a part of daily life, than to take athletic exercises or any other treatment that cannot be continued indefinitely. Your habits are to determine that. What is good for you may not be good for another. The kind of life you lead, if it agrees with you, is the kind of life you should lead, if you prefer it. 7. Be yourself. Do not try to follow any rules of diet, except to keep away from food poisons. Otherwise, act on the principle that no two persons are alike, and that you need to know your\u00ac self as an individual. 84 PERSONAL BOOK Chapter Eleven specialties From dull monotony to unsought variation is a step towards a better state of mind and body. ^Jira) VERYBODY enjoys a change from the fixed routine ^e daily nieals. A visit to another place, if only for a day, is sure to whet the appetite because of the prospect of newness, or a difference in the cooking. There is a sameness of odor to the foods that come from one kitchen all the time. The sense of smell may of itself invite appetite. But there are some things that the stomach will learn to crave all the year round, and three times a day, if a slight variation is made from time to time. The first of these is wheat bread. Wheat is the food of civilization. Corn meal has its place in the cold seasons, but it is what people call \"filling.\" It is valuable under Certain circumstances. Beef is attractive when cooked the first time; after that it ceases to hold the appetite. A person could take good, freshly cooked beef three times a day the year round; but this is neither necessary nor advisable. Mealy potatoes are as attractive as wheat bread if they are properly cooked. Other meats and game, as well as poultry and fresh fish, are means of tempting the appetite. Still there arises the liking for something different; and the stomach actually demands it. Raw milk is unattractive, while milk cooked in various pleasing desserts is eagerly eaten. Raw eggs are likewise not desired; but any form of cooking that turns the yolk to powder, and prevents the white from coagulating, is RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 85 wholesome; although a slightly cooked white may be digested by a sound stomach. The fried white or yolk is wholly indigestible even by a hungry stomach. It becomes a wear and tear on the vitality. Variations in the methods of cooking meats, eggs, milk, bread, potatoes, vegetables such as the young peas, beans and limas, and other things, will prove a valuable means of building up the health through appetite; for variety brings appetite. There should not be a great variety at each meal. Mr. Roose\u00ac velt, when living in the White House, ate his midday meal of nothing but bread and milk. While a big dinner given to others might cost him thousands of dollars, his own meal cost but a few cents; and he, of all the eaters, was better nourished; for a bowl of bread and milk affords much more nourishment than a dinner of many courses. Yet human nature is so constituted that it will not accept the inexpensive diet; but wants the high-priced kinds, and the opportunity to complain of the increased cost of living. There are millionaires today who spend a small fortune dining their guests, and who sit down to bread and milk by the advice of their doctors; and are the better for it. If men and women were to eat only the most wholesome things, which are always the simplest and the plainest, there would never be a com\u00ac plaint against the high price of foods. Real food is abundant. The fewer different things there are at the same meal, the better. If it is a meat meal, then bread, potatoes and vegetables should be all that accompanies it; with as little bread as possible. Meat, potatoes and vegetables make the best alliance. Bread goes best with fruits, milk, eggs and the like. Meat and potatoes make a wholesome meal, if the meat is freshly cooked. The stomach does not do well with bread and vegetables. Po\u00ac tatoes go nicely with vegetables; or, in place of the latter, with eggs, milk and the like. Milk and meat do not do well together at the same meal, and eggs should not be taken when there is meat in the stomach. The two should be separated. Meats and desserts do not make good blood. It may seem strange, but it is a fact that desserts should be confined to a dessert meal. Ice cream, cake and such articles, should never be taken at the same meal with meat; for meat is the natural accom- 86 PERSONAL BOOK paniment of potatoes and vegetables,, and of nothing else except a small bit of bread, the less the better. Bread and milk, or bread and bntter, or bread and cake make a good meal; although it is a rule of nature that anything made of flour or any of the cereals needs milk in some form to turn it into good blood. The French have a very good custom for a regular breakfast which they seem to thrive on day after day and year after year. It consists of coffee made without boil\u00ac ing, taken half and half with hot milk that has not been boiled; accompanied by rolls or bread made out of the freshly ground wheat which is nearly the whole wheat, the outer coats of the grain being discarded. It is not a starch wheat flour which is so much used in dyspeptic America. Fruits open the breakfast. A lunch of cake and milk, if the cake is several days old, has very little added richness except raisins, but no dried cur\u00ac rants in it, will make good blood and give health. If a person is inclined to the use of meat, it should be eaten daily, but always in a freshly cooked form, and never fried. Meat should not be allowed to enter the stomach oftener than once a day. The penalty is sure to be paid sooner or later, if this rule is broken. The best time is at noon, and the next best time is in the morning, to eat meat. The least favorable time is in the evening meal; but, as most persons have no opportunity to take meat at noon, and do not care for it at the breakfast, it is gen\u00ac erally found at the evening meal. If eaten then in small quan\u00ac tity, and at least five hours before retiring, it may be assimilated without much trouble; but a man or woman who is not in the best of health, should not take meat then. As it is the natural accompaniment of potatoes and vegetables, this nitrogenous mix\u00ac ture is sure to keep the nerves of the brain and spinal cord uneasy all night, even if the body sleeps. The slumber will not be re\u00ac freshing. There is never a perfectly restful night where meat dinners are eaten late in the day or in the evening. But the most barbarous custom is that of night dinners. No wonder the per\u00ac sons who indulge in such a breach of natural laws, suffer untold nervous miseries sooner or later. The ideal meals are as follows: For the morning: Juicy fruits, baked potatoes, eggs, bread and other things that attract the appetite. If you have the coffee habit and it does not make you nervous or give you pains around RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 87 the heart, then take a mixture of hot, but unboiled coffee, half and half with hot but unboiled milk. For the noon meal: If you are in the habit of eating meats, take them then, but not fried; and take potatoes in any form that is mealy, but not crisy fried. Vegetables belong to this meal. Other things that are attractive may be added; but desserts should not be eaten when meat is in the stomach, as they conflict and tax the heart and vitality. For the evening meal: Carbons, such as bread, cakes, food fruits like figs, dates, bananas, and raisins. But bananas, being a meat-bread may open any meal; but never should be eaten when there is any food in the stomach; nor should the stomach remain empty of other foods after bananas are eaten. They are the first course; they go with other food, but always a step ahead, and never behind. Other attractions may be taken at the even\u00ac ing meal. The theory of the morning meal is this: There should have been a light evening meal preceding, and more than twelve hours of rest for the stomach between that meal and the breakfast. This will find the morning meal inviting; whereas a heavy evening meal will clog the whole system, and you will arise in the morning with furred tongue, a bad taste in the mouth, and a clogged system. Gastric juice will not flow into the stomach, and thus the break\u00ac fast will be useless; yet if you omit it, you will find a headache or neuralgia haunting you all day. This derangement of the sys\u00ac tem is caused by the one barbarism of a heavy evening meal. We know of many thousands of men and women, mostly the latter, who were once addicted to fearful headaches, and who cured them by the following plan: A very light no-meat supper at six o'clock; a cup of hot clear soup, or bouillon just on retiring for the night, and a consequent keen appetite every morning for breakfast. Those who refused to change their methods, said boast- ingly that they preferred the headaches in the day time rather than give up their heavy evening dinners; so they were compelled to take drugs to check the headaches, and terrible cocaine and morphine habits have now ruined them body and soul. Which course was better? When there has been a light evening meal, and over twelve hours* of fasting during the interval between that meal and the breakfast of the next morning, the use of the diet that built up 88 PERSONAL BOOK the body in the plan set forth in a previous chapter is partly recommended. It is toast, lightly cooked eggs, baked potatoes, and milk prepared as stated. This is slightly varied from the Nine First New Meals; but is the same in principle. By adopt\u00ac ing it, there is a constant process of making a different body. The results are so valuable that they are worth the slight self-denial required to make them permanent. Do you have the smoking habit. If so, then enjoy it after a meal, and never on an empty stomach. It will aid digestion if you are a smoker; otherwise it is a useless and unhealthy habit. Do you like sweetmeats ? If so, eat them only when there is wholesome food in the stomach. If you indulge in them at any other time, when the stomach is empty, or contains rich things, you will bring on acute indigestion which is felling thou\u00ac sands of supposedly well persons every year. Candy and sweet things, and certain nuts help digestion when there is wholesome food in the stomach. It is sufficient to eat them sparingly, as they serve only to cause a great flow of gastric juice into the stomach and have no other benefit. As the smoker does not swal\u00ac low the smoke in order to digest his food, but gets the exciting cause at the palate of the mouth, so a small piece of candy, an almond nut, or other thing that is relished, will start such a flow of juices, and need not be swallowed. A man who liked ice cream, but who was always given indigestion when he ate it, found that a teaspoonful held in the mouth until it melted served to set up the process of digestion for the meal that was in his stomach. A woman who liked mints and who had a very sluggish stomach, could always start digestion by holding this candy in her mouth. A man who could not drink coffee on account of the bad effect on his heart, always took a cup and inhaled the at\u00ac tractive odor from it; and he found that it started digestion for him. A piece of cake that is nor rich will do the same thing. So will anything that is liked; and a trifle will be better than a quantity. The odor, the flavor, the taste, will generally do as much good as the actual eating of it. Many a man who has acquired a nicotine heart from smoking, now holds an un\u00ac lighted cigar in his mouth after a meal, and it helps him wonder- fully. It is the law of appeal to the palate. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 89 A bit of fried bacon, crisp and of rich flavor, if chewed for a long time in the month and never swallowed, will start diges\u00ac tion by causing the flow of the gastric juices. Of this there is not the slightest doubt; yet the bacon itself if swallowed may cause acute indigestion. Fried potato chips will kill the vitality as quickly as anything in this world; but one held in the mouth for a short time and not eaten, will attract digestion; but not as readily as fried bacon. Fried things serve a good purpose at the palate and are fatal in the stomach. It shows that nature in\u00ac tends attractive things to be used as far as the mouth. No one swallows the smoke of a cigar. No one who chews tobacco, swal\u00ac lows the juice. No one who chews gum swallows the gum. What\u00ac ever fascinates the palate with pleasure, if taken when the stomach contains wholesome food, will assist digestion, and having done this much the agency of the good result may be dismissed. Bacon when fried crisp is one of the greatest appetizers ever made; yet it is indigestible in the stomach. Let it be discarded from the mouth like gum or other thing that is manipulated there as a mouth visitor only. The same facts apply to many other specialties that are at\u00ac tractive. In cold weather the system demands things that are not liked in hot weather. Corn meal is a great heater, and should not be used in the summer; but the white corn meal may be used iu winter, spring and fall to the great benefit of the body. A pint of sweet milk, two eggs, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of baking soda, one teaspoonful of pure cream tartar, and enough white corn meal to make a soft batter, will furnish the ingredients. It should be baked in a medium hot oven over one hour. This is a wholesome cake that has more strength-giv\u00ac ing nutrition than its weight in meat, and is a better food. THE CONSTANT CAKES. The following are called the Constant Cakes, because they never cease to be welcome. When people once start to eating them, they are eagerly sought and are liked more than any other thing. They have the qualities of being a bread, and at the same time of being a cake with none of the richness or indigestibility of cake. They may serve as bread or as a dessert in a meal. It makes no difference whether they are eaten first, middle or last. 90 PERSONAL BOOK Their ingredients are the most wholesome and the most in\u00ac vigorating of any single line of food that can be eaten alone that has yet been discovered. How to make Constant Cakes: Get some Porto Rico mo\u00ac lasses, which is the old fashioned molasses of our great grand\u00ac fathers. Do not get the light colored molasses, but the good old dark kind. It is hard to find except in the large cities, but any grocer can get it if he chooses. We buy it for about half the cost of the lighter molasses, and it serves the purpose better, be\u00ac sides being more digestible, and does not contain glucose. Gro\u00ac cers claim they do not make more money on the Hew Orleans or light molasses; but the fact is they make a much greater profit on that, which is the reason why the Porto Rico is not carried in stock. In Boston Brown Bread, the Porto Rico is essential if the real article is desired. Having made a strenuous fight to get the black molasses, take two cupfuls of it, and one cupful of butter, and get them to\u00ac gether. When they have been warmed enough to soften the but\u00ac ter, take from the stove, and add to them the following: One- and-a-half teaspoonsful of pure powdered ginger, three well beaten eggs, and mix well. Add alternately, in small quantities, three cupfuls of flour and one cupful of boiling water in which three teaspoonfuls of baking soda have been dissolved. Ho cream tar\u00ac tar or baking powder will be needed. A goodly quantity of seeded raisins should be added. Cut into cakes of the usual size, four or five inches in diame\u00ac ter, keep them thin, and bake soft. They must not be made into a hard cake, as their usefulness will be impaired from the start. The soft, or bready thin cakes are what is desired. Remember this fact. What do the Constant Cakes contain: Wheat flour.\u2014So does bread. Ginger.\u2014This is beneficial to the body and attractive to the palate. Eggs-\u2014These are food of the first value. Butter.\u2014This is food also of high value, as well as cost. Black molasses.\u2014This is free from glucose, and is both whole\u00ac some and attractive to the taste. Baking Soda.\u2014This is one of the best known blood cleansers when not used in connection with cream tartar. The avoidance RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 91 \u00a9f baking powder is an important fact in the making of the Con\u00ac stant Cakes. Raisins.\u2014This is the meat of the tropics where flesh is never eaten. Raisins are givers of great vitality to the body, and attract the palate. It is not best to eat them uncooked, nor is wise to eat them alone. In the Constant Cakes they are in their best place. Ten persons ate three meals in one day consisting of nothing but fried potato chips, and all nearly died. On the same day ten other persons ate three meals in one day of nothing but Constant Cakes, and all thrived and were the better for it. They may be constantly with you. If you have to get a quick lunch away from home, take six Constant Cakes and they will suf\u00ac fice. There are bankers who eat nothing else six days in the week, every week in the year unless they are away. Some add a glass of milk, and the meal is then fit for a king. The strongest laborer or the most delicate sedentary person will find this combination a perfect one, and it will sustain life indefinitely. Have the Constant Cakes on the table at every meal, and catch up a few of them to take with you when you go out and are likely to be detained, for they will tide you over a hungry interval in the day. They are the best for children, the best for young people, the best for the lunch-eater, and the best for every man and woman who wants nutritive food in an attractive form. \\ou will never get tired of them. A child who took six of them to school every day for the lunch, had to give up five to her friends, and some of these were divided into parts. In a short time, an\u00ac other scholar began to bring them, for they were soon popular. The mother of the second girl sent for the receipt, and this began the episode of a better food at the school lunch with the result that the children who brought the Constant Cakes were always in bet\u00ac ter health than the others; and they liked those Constant Cakes, which made digestion easy. Fully ripe and mellow bananas, very mellow and soft sweet apples, and bread sandwiches filled with sliced yolks of hard boiled eggs salted to taste, make attractive and health-giving lunches or even meals. Various mints, or small discs of cream candy, should be kept in the house to use at the end of meals, for the purpose of pleasing the palate and aiding digestion. 9 2 PERSONAL BOOK Roasted almonds, but not roasted peanuts, are helpful. So are boiled or roasted chestnuts if mealy. Oily nuts are bad. Raw peanuts, with the skins bleached off, are helpful if taken in small quantities and chewed fine. But peanuts are generally injurious to the liver and aggravate diabetes. It is always possible to add something attractive to the food list without resorting to pastry and fried things. These break up the blood, tend to cause tuberculosis, and lead to anaemia as well as atrophy, two conditions that weaken the organs all through the body. Omitting them, seek all the good things in the world that please the mind and tickle the palate, and eat like a royal guest at the table of nature. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 93 Chapter Twelve FOOD SELECTION All Is not gold that glitters and It has taken centuries to discover what are foods and what are poisonous eatables. UMANITY has found many foods for its use, but it has not yet found them all; and some of the things that are regarded as foods, are not wholly so. The end of all nutrition is to make blood; and blood comes from a milk that is made in the alimentary canal. This milk comes from albumin, and the latter is found either in blood, or in plant life, or its products. Cattle and horses find albumin in grass. The Bible says that man shall eat grass. In the West the millers are grinding alfalfa into flour and the blend makes a very wholesome bread. It lowers the cost of food to a considerable extent. But because we mention this fact, it does not follow that we advocate such a mixture. At the present writing we see no objection to it. A starving man will eat grass and will keep alive on it. Even dry hay has saved men from death when they could get no other food. Albumin, being the one thing required to furnish the body with food, the first step to be taken is to find it in that condition that is most pleasing and most beneficial to man. The white of an egg is pure albumin. Any cereal, such as wheat, rye, corn, and rice, if ground into flour and cooked, will become albumin when fully mingled with the saliva of the mouth and the gastric juices of the stomach; otherwise it will ferment and cause distress and loss of vitality. So that it is a part of the work of eating to create albumin from foods that contain its parts. 94 PERSONAL BOOK The danger in the use of foods is that all the products of nature are mixed with parts that are not food. Thus the covering of wheat and other grains, is no more digestible than the nails of the fingers. The real food is that part of the wheat berry that is freed from the outer coats, but not all of them. The French method of grinding secures the best part of the wheat; while the American method either uses the whole grain or else takes only the inner starch. Neither course is right. Oats are subject to the same rule. The inner parts are called groats, and are very nutritious. The Scotch use them. But in America the entire oat grain is used, and the stomach and in\u00ac testines suffer. Rice is also mis-treated. In Japan they use more of the grain and do not bleach it; the result being that the people of Japan are the most healthful and the strongest in the world, as they practically live on rice. In America the inner parts are used, and they are bleached, which takes away their vital nature. Buckwheat is not a true food for man. It does not harm the body very much, but it lacks good nutrition, and causes headaches from its deficient nutrition. Yellow corn is oily and heating. It suffices in cold weather in the North to keep the body warm; but the man who eats yellow corn in the summer time will be uncomfortable from an excess of heat in the blood. In the United States white corn is an ideal winter food, and may be prepared in many forms. While bran is not digestible, there is much phosphate dust in any floury bran. This can be used by making lemonade without sugar, and mixing in it the juice of the bran as it is called. This is obtained by soaking the bran in water and allowing the latter to strain through cloth into the lemonade. A quart of bran in two quarts of water will furnish a large quantity. Strange to say this bran lemonade is both refreshing and nutritious. Ice water is not good to drink when one is heated. Baseball players put bran water in ice water, and drink the mixture, sipping it slowly. They find it very refreshing and invigorating. Yeast raised bread is the best. The yeast is lost in the form of carbonic acid gas. When baking powders are used, they leave a mineral in the bread or cake; and alum is a slow but steady poison which tears the lining off the intestines and exposes the appendix, RALSTON HEALTH CLUB (J5 which gives rise to appendicitis. Any poison, or any adulteration, or any preservative, however harmless to the general health, is sure to act on the lining of the intestines, and sooner or later bring on appendicitis when it catches the vitality at low ebb. People who live in countries where the preservatives are not used in foods, meats and drinks, never are attacked with this modern malady. The carbonic acid gas that is set free by yeast, raises the bread or cake; and this gas should be given time to escape before the bread is eaten, if there is the slightest disorder in the stomach; otherwise new bread, rolls, and cakes may be eaten hot if chewed well and thoroughly mixed with the saliva of the mouth before being swallowed. They will turn to albumin when so masticated. For the weak stomach and for a low state of vitality in the intestines, old wheat bread toasted and eaten hot, is by far the best food, if broken in a soft boiled egg, or into a glass of milk. The albumin of the egg-white, is changed into a coagulated mass when it hardens under the influence of heat. It is then a source of strain on the vital powers to dispose of it when in the stomach. The same is true of the albumin of meat. If you wish a roast in its best condition with all the juice value held in, put the roast in a quick oven where the great heat will at once coagulate the whole surface of the meat, and prevent the juices from running out. On the other hand if the roast is put into an oven that is not very hot, much of the value of the meat will be lost. Whatever is co\u00ac agulated is turned into an indigestible condition. This explains why the crisp outer surface of a roast cannot be endured by a weak stomach, although the palate craves that part. It is good to set free the gastric juices, and serves this purpose when it is chewed and not swallowed. In the mouth it is an angel; in the stomach, it is not. This is true of all crisp surfaces. They serve to stimulate appetite and bring the fluids into the stomach; but they are useful in that way only as long as they remain in the mouth. The habit of quickly swallowing anything that has a delicious flavor is as wrong in fact as the act of putting delicate extracts of the rose in the nose where a violent irritation is set up. As long as fine perfumes feed the sense of smell at the portals of the nose, so long are they pleasant. As long as anything that has an exceptionally fine taste is kept in the mouth, so long is 96 PERSONAL BOOK the taste present; but as soon as it is swallowed, it is gone. Taste ceases with the dropping of the food to the stomach. The latter organ has no sense of enjoyment, except at the nerves of the palate in the mouth. Crisp meats and such an appetizer as bacon belong only in the mouth. Pie crust and every form of pastry is good flour turned into an indigestible condition. Its end is acute indigestion. In the mouth it is an angel of pleasure; in the stomach it is a demon of night\u00ac mares. Why not treat all pastry, all piecrust and all crisp meats and surfaces as you treat chewing gum; chew the pleasure out of them, and then annex the remains to the under part of the table or back of the bed post? In almost any large family you will find exhausted chewing gum sticking to the concealed parts of the furni\u00ac ture, if you make the hunt. Eich cake is a ferment-producer, because it holds in its con\u00ac struction a wholly wrong combination of things. Butter and sugar will not digest, but will ferment. Cream and sugar are about the same form of evil. The whites of eggs and sugar will cause fer\u00ac ment. Too much sugar in flour is bad. Cake that is not rich and that is kept for a few days, having no other fruit in it than dates or figs or raisins, will be good, and probably better than bread. Many persons make a whole meal from such a diet and thrive. While raisins are healthful forms of grapes, and never cause any trouble if they are not eaten raw, on the other hand currants that are dried are not from grapes, but from berries that are not regarded as food. Some persons can digest dried currants, but most persons, even those who are well, are harmed by them. Tapioca is a good food; but the imitation, pearl tapioca, is not food, and will hurt the stomach. A dead ripe and soft banana is filled to the brim with good albumin ready to make rich, red blood; hut a banana that is ripe looking, but that has not yet mellowed, has almost no albumin, for it has not been set free. Here an hour or two marks the line be\u00ac tween the best and the worst of conditions. Skill is required to determine when the banana is ready to eat. Always err on the side of over-ripeness, and you will be safe In the plum you can study this quick development of albumin. The sweet plums are very sweet and rich in flavor when their albumin has been set free by the ripening of the small cells within; RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 97 an hour or so before this albumin is set free, the plum will be sour and unpleasant to the taste, and the flesh will be hard; but in a brief while the flesh will become mePow, and the sweetness will be present. Here is the secret of eating apples. Most apples are not food, because they do not contain developed albumin. When they are sweet and become very mellow, then they are food; otherwise they may cause intestinal trouble, and set up neuralgia and rheumatism. Cherries are dangerous and have caused quick death from bowel troubles when eaten before their albumin has been set free in the form of mellow flesh and good juice; but when these two qualities have entered into the cherry, it is one of the best foods in the world, and gives good blood to the veins. The same is true of peaches and of all kinds of juicy fruits. Of course, no person could live indefinitely on this class of fruits; but the food fruits, as the bananas, the dates, the figs and the raisins, will sustain life for a long time, and improve the health. Vegetables when raw are rich in albumin as they come closest to grass; especially lettuce. But the tubers, such as turnips, beets, parsnips, and the like, are too full of fibres to be useful for human digestion. The potato is free from fibers. Radishes are safe in very small quantities, but are fibrous and indigestible. They serve as an appetizer. Huts, such as the almond and the chestnut, when boiled or roasted, are good; and other nuts that are not oily may be taken raw. Peanuts should be avoided if there is liver disorder. Coffee, if it is real coffee, should not be boiled, but may be made by the drip method, or it may be brought to the boiling point with a tight cover to retain all the vapors. The latter takes away the good of everything. Coffee pots are now made for this purpose of holding in the moisture. The most vicious of all customs is that of boiling coffee, or making it too long ahead of its use. A poison is set free very soon after heat is applied to it, and this does great harm to the stomach and eventually to the heart. Ho person should drink old coffee; have it just made when you take it. Tea is not a food. It deranges the heart, the nervous system, and the kidneys in time. You never saw a tea drinker who was not nervous. When\u00ac ever they are found, they are taking medicines between meals, and at night for some form of head or nervous troubles. 98 PERSONAL BOOK Iced tea is a slow form of suicide, and is so pronounced by the United States chief chemist. Cocoa from an absolutely reliable source may be useful when cooked with milk as a drink; but be careful that it is pure. Chocolate is not pure at the present day. When we say that ninety per cent, of all chocolate is impure, we are not putting it too strong. The result of eating this adulteration, which is advertised as purity itself, is a backache, or a headache, or neuralgia, or heart irritation, or blood disturbance. To be safe, never allow any choco\u00ac late of any make to enter the body. Let fruit syrups alone, and all canned fruits alone. Let canned goods alone as far as you are able to get along without them. It is one of the Ralston Mottoes: \"We never buy canned or package goods/' If you do buy them you are not sure what you are getting. But there are some pure foods put up in packages. Let hygienic foods alone. Let alone all substitutes for food or drink. Let cereal coffee alone, or your heart will pay the penalty. The only condiments are ginger and salt. All spices are in\u00ac digestible and linger in the system to form centres for uric acid crystals. Salt contains the important part of the gastric juice, which is needed. But too much salt causes fatty degeneration be\u00ac cause it breaks down good tissue of an organ. Ice cream is generally made of sugar and cream flavored. Sugar and cream set up gas and ferment, and derange the stomach. Frozen custard or water ice are more wholesome. Avoid fancy drinks. It is well known that many of them are drugged in the hope that a fixed habit will be formed. Do not eat re-cooked meat. It is bad enough when fresh; but when it has been cooked over, it is useless as food; the strain on the vitality being greater than its nutritive value. A dog will never eat thoroughly cooked meat; he will starve to death first. He knows it has no food in it. Look out for hashed foods. Let them alone. Sausages would never be eaten by humanity if they saw them made from the first selection of the ingredients. In them are some good things, but there are added a lot of tendons, muscles, cartilage, and parts of dogs, goats, horses, cows that died from disease, and everything else that can be hidden in the concoction. It is the most barbarous product of an age of boasted civilization. Is a man who eats sausage really civilized ? RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 99 On the same principle let mince meat alone. If it were pure, it would nevertheless be indigestible, owing to the presence of cur\u00ac rants and of chopped un-mellowed apples, both of which are enemies to the body. Let fried potato chips alone. They are even worse than sau\u00ac sages. Quick and fatal acute indigestion will follow these errors. If you are traveling on the road and come to a sign which says, STOP, LOOK, LISTEN, you will stop, if you have sense, and you will look and listen. But the other day one of the ablest clergymen of a great city came to a railroad crossing when the gates were down. His little girl was with him. She had come down as far as the tracks to see him off. He kissed her good bye, and plunged under the gates just in time to be struck by a rushing train, and he died before the eyes of the daughter whom he had just kissed. It was no suicide. He thought he had time and op\u00ac portunity to pass over the tracks despite the warning of the low\u00ac ered gates. So he gave up his life to the god of chance. The same is true of warnings in the diet. Thousands of peo\u00ac ple who are in good health, die every year from aoute indigestion, and other thousands suffer from appendicitis. These troubles are caused by the willingness of humanity to take chances in what they eat. STOP! LOOK! LISTEN! 100 PERSONAL BOOK Chapter Thirteen SUGAR PROBLEMS From earliest infancy the craving taste has sought the sweet and tempting products of the 'uicy sugar cane. ANY facts are known about sugar at the present day that were not known a generation ago, or were over\u00ac looked. These facts may seem on their face to be too scientific for the general reader; but they hold such a close relationship to the health of the body and its re-building that they cannot be evaded. If the following array shall prove too dull for you, take it slowly and allow your brain to rest between items. If you master only one fact a day, you are gaining wisdom. 1. Sugar is almost pure carbon. This element exists in many forms. 2. The only real food of life is carbon. While it alone is not sufficient, all other foods are mere incidents to carbon. This is ex\u00ac plained in another part of this work. 3. All the energy, strength, power, heat, life, motion, and en\u00ac durance of the body must come solely from its fuel, which is car\u00ac bon; just as carbon is the only fuel of the locomotive or other engine. Nothing else but carbon gives power and active life to the human body. 4. Carbon is found in foods in several groups. The first and most important group is that of starches, which are the products of the grains. The second and next important is the group of animal and vegetable fats. The third is the group of sweets, known as sugars and syrups. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 101 5. Some doctors are wholly antagonistic to sugars; others recommend them. At an association of dentists held in July, 1910, at Asbury Park, New Jersey, it was agreed that \"sugar is nothing but crystalized acid,\" and is one of the most harmful agents that enter the body. It was urged on all dentists to fight against the use of sugars and candies among children especially. There is no doubt that sweets have much to do with the early decay of the teeth. 6. It would seem thus that a case had been made out against sugar. But there are strong natural facts on the other side. In the tropics the heat is so great that heating foods ought not to be eaten, if theory is to prevail. But as life consists of fuel-power, and as carbon is the only fuel power that can possibly be taken into the body, it must be eaten in the tropics. While it is a heat-produc\u00ac ing food, its discomforts never show themselves unless an excess is eaten, or it is wrongly combined in preparation. In the tropics the products of the sugar cane furnish direct power with the least pos\u00ac sible tax on the digestive system; and these, when used in connec\u00ac tion with such a fruit as the banana, give the desired strength and lead to good health. As the non-heating foods are nitrogenous, their use in hot weather tends to weakness of the digestive system, and consequent diarrhoea. Sugars have an opposite effect; as they tend to constipation, as do all power-foods. 7. The voice of nature is the best guide when it is rightly un\u00ac derstood. This voice speaks aloud in children. They all crave sweets. The craving is so great that, once started, it rejects the so- called wholesome foods for sweets. As this demand is universal, it cannot be ignored. 8. Here again there is a double question. Children under two years of age cannot digest sugars or sweets of any kind. Such foods pass through their bodies unchanged except by dissolution. 9. The excessive use of sugars and sweets among infants will set up diarrhoea, the very trouble that is checked by the same foods in adults. But babies will digest animal carbons, such as cream and fats, from the very first hour of life. Honey, free from the comb, if known to be pure, is easily digested by young children whose systems will not absorb sugars. Honey is animal carbon. 10. Vegetable fats, such as olive oil, cocoa oil, and the like, are digested by infants. 11. Sugars and sweets occupy, therefore, a place by themselves. They are called the products of the sugar cane. 102 PERSONAL BOOK 12. Nature suits her products to the climate in which they are grown. What is obtainable in the far North is best suited to the people who live there. What is at hand in the temperate zone is suited to its inhabitants. So what grows in other parts of the world is best for the people who dwell where it is found. Nature never contemplated transportation lines. This fact does not pre\u00ac clude us from using the foods of other lands if we find them agree able and not hurtful. But it would undoubtedly be better for each nation if it confined itself to its own products. In the far North animal carbons predominate; in the temperate climes, the grain or starch-carbons abound; and in the hot zone and tropics the sugars are at hand. 13. Unmixed foods are hurtful. The nitrogens if taken as such are sure to set up intestinal troubles. So the carbons are not good alone. Sugars and sweets in proper combinations, even in our climate, have a great value; but, alone, they become dangerous acids. 14. Giving straight sugar or candy to a child old enough to digest it, will very soon cause trouble. If the child is under two years of age, as has been stated, it will not digest it, and diarrhoea will follow; but if it is older the result is the formation of gases from fermentation. 15. Ask your mother what she most fears in the child that is in ordinary health, and she will say colic. Now colic is fermen\u00ac tation which sets free gases that distend or stretch the walls of the intestines and cause griping pains. Did the mother ever stop to think that colic cannot arise except from fermentation; and that nothing ever ferments except carbon ? It is the carbon in milk that causes its souring and gas-making habits. It is the carbon in bread and cake that set up gases in the system. Much of the misery in children is due to the practice of giving candies and sugars to them at too early an age, and of giving it straight when they are old enough to digest it. 16. There are two rules of golden value that should be under\u00ac stood and adopted: First RuleCandies and sugars should never be allowed to enter an empty stomach. Second Rule:\u2014Sweets should never be combined with animal carbons. 17. As sweets are carbons from the vegetable kingdom, coming from the sap of trees, as the maple, or from the sap of canes, they RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 103 are known as vegetable carbons; and vegetable carbons when com\u00ac bined with animal carbons, set up poisons and fermentations of the most injurious character. In other words the animal and vege\u00ac table carbons will not mingle safely when in concentrated form. 18. Some persons are blessed with an iron clad digestive sys\u00ac tem, which will withstand for a long time any kind of abuse; but, as the present era is known as the age of stomach breakdown, there is nothing to hope for when the following combinations are sanc\u00ac tioned. A person who would be safe must avoid them. a. Sugar and butter. b. Sugar and cream. c. Sugar and eggs, or sugar and albumen, which is largely carbon. 19. The combination of sugar and butter in what is known as hard sauee, is a severe attack on the blood and digestive system. Persons who have eaten it freely have been made almost deathly sick by it. Anything that is food can be eaten by itself or in a natural combination. 20. The combination of cream and sugar leads to gas in the stomach and intestines; where there is but little taken and other food is in the stomach to mix with it, the fermentation is lessened. But it slowly day by day increases its power of harm until at last the collapse comes in the form of chronic dyspepsia or organic breakdown. Tests have been made by the thousands in the use of ice cream, with the same result. Some persons are able to go for many years without being seriously harmed by ice cream, but they fail quickly when the time comes. 21. The combination of sugar and egg, especially the white of an egg, while not so bad as the sugar and butter or cream, is hurt\u00ac ful for the reason that fermentation is set up and the most deadly of all poisons that enter the body, carbonic gas, is generated. 22. As sugar when not combined with natural foods becomes a destroying acid in the body, it should not be taken on an empty stomach. It is not injurious in small quantity when the stomach contains wholesome food, and none that is rich m its character. As an acid in crystal form, as stated by the dentists, it is powerful enough to eat the enamel from the teeth; and anything that can do that is an enemy. 23. Yet, in spite of its bad record, sugar holds an important place in nature. It is good when treated right; and it is bad when 104 PERSONAL BOOK mis-applied. The strongest and perhaps the strangest of all facts in food laws is the intense craving that people of all ages have for sugar or its carbon. 24. A child that has never had anything sweet, will be wonder\u00ac fully attracted and fascinated by sugar. It can be led by it. Noth\u00ac ing in all its horizon of life is one per cent, as pleasing. If it can not get sugar in the form of candy or cubes, it will crave it in the form of sweet cakes. Let a boy have before him a few slices of bread with good butter to spread on them; and at the same table a few cakes made of the same flour with sugar added; and he will, if left wholly to his own inclinations, devote himsely solely to the cakes. We know a man who gets his own breakfast, as his wife is not in good health. She leaves for him plenty of good bread, and plenty of cake. For the last thirty years he has eaten nothing but cake for breakfast; and as he is now nearly seventy years of age and seems well, it must follow that he has fuel enough to begin his day's work with. On two occasions only was he made ill. One was when the cake was too rich for him; the other was when he supplemented it with confectionery. As a matter of fact, the cake he has eaten for thirty years has been plain, not very sweet, and well combined with flour. In effect it is chemically the same as bread and butter ; for the sweetening in the cake is carbon, as butter is; and the rest of the cake is principally flour such as is used in making bread. A banker tells us that he has for more than twenty years eaten nothing for his mid-day meal except half a dozen home made ginger cakes; and that he learned to like these from seeing one of the bank clerks make his noon meal from them. He now says that this clerk has, for more than forty years, made his noon meal solely of ginger cakes. Noth\u00ac ing but water has been taken with them. 25. Most any child will prefer sweet cakes to bread and butter; yet the chemical composition is the same in both. 26. The intense craving of all humanity for carbon or the product of carbon is a fact that cannot be ignored. It means that nature has something in mind that must be learned and adopted. 27. The craving for alcoholic beverages is just as strong as the craving for carbons. But the same person does not crave both. If a young man is brought up to like sweets, he will never crave alcohol. The reason is plain. Carbon and alcohol are different forms of each other. You cannot get alcohol from anything but carbon. All whiskey is made from the starches of grains, which are RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 105 carbon. Rum is made from molasses, which is liquid sugar from the sugar cane. It can be made from sugar. It is a very simple matter to produce alcohol from any sugar. Grapes contain much sugar as is seen in raisins; and gin and brandy are alcoholic forms of that sugar. A man who craves alcohol has very little use for candies or sweets. And the reverse is true; train a man to like sweets and he will not seek alcohol. His system cannot stand both. But the craving is about the same. Some doctors say that sugars and candies do more harm than alcohol; but sugars and candies do not make men criminals and murderers, a feat that alcohol accom\u00ac plishes in thousands of cases every year. 28. There is but one real food, and it is carbon. It is found in fats, oils, starches and sweets. All else is incidental although necessary. To get carbon is the one chief demand of all living creatures. It happens to appear in a very intense form in sugars, and in alcohol, and the human race is divided into two classes, one seeking sweets and the other seeking fermented sweets. 29. One man in Hew York has made millions of dollars in the manufacture of candies which young men have used as baits for catching young ladies' hearts. The stomach is next door to the heart, and love has been born in many a box of bonbons. These together with soda water with its sweet syrups, and its ice cream with its sweet flavors and sugar, have made life seem one intense dream of bliss. 30. As alcohol when abused holds the devil in its spirits, so sweets when abused point the way to the grave. In this country there are countless thousands of girls and young ladies with spend\u00ac ing money who, near the close of the afternoon, find themselves in the vicinity of the candy store and the soda fountain. They can no more pass them by than the man with a thirst can clear himself of the call of the saloon. More than this, young ladies near the close of any afternoon have the keenest appetite of the whole twenty-four hours; and they indulge freely in the ice cream soda and the con\u00ac fectionery. In many such cases, where physicians had been in\u00ac formed of the practice in a certain city, parents saved their daugh\u00ac ters from certain stomach ruin; while in other cities the girls are doctoring for indigestion and organic trouble, and their parents are paying the bills, not knowing that the whole cause is the silly and senseless indulgence in sweets on an empty stomach. And the sweets are in the most vicious form. In one home a young lady 106 PERSONAL BOOK comes into the house just before the evening meal. In her stomach there is a glass of ice cream soda, and nearly a pound of candy. She cannot eat anything at the table. Her mother becomes anxious. Her father consults the doctor. The cause is not known. But ill health and a large medical bill are the first results. If you do not believe this statement, go to any store where soda water and con\u00ac fectionery are sold; go in the late afternoon, shortly before the even\u00ac ing meal; and note the facts. You will be surprised to see the quantities of candies that delicate misses eat on stomachs that are worse than empty; having soda water as the first course. It is an intense craving that does all this. The power of the mind should mark the huamn being as superior to animal desires, so that the latter may be controlled. 31. By many thousands of tests it has been ascertained that nature has a purpose in this craving, and in every form of craving. This purpose is discussed in a still more important department of the present book. To learn how to take advantage of it is one of the chief duties of the human race in this era. 32. The present chapter may be summed up as follows: a. Sugar in certain combinations or under certain conditions is a decided enemy of the body. On the other hand if sugar is taken in proper combinations with other things, and under proper conditions, it serves a most useful purpose. c. The universal craving for sweets is a part of the plan of nature to assist in the work of building the body; and the correct understanding of this plan is one of the most important studies of life. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 107 Chapter Fourteen THE SEVENTEEN WONDERS OF LIFE O Nature, gracious mother of us all, Within thy bosom myriad secrets lie Which thou surrenderest to the patient eye That seeks and waits. VERY human being exists in a body that is a most wonderful temple. It is full of mysteries that have baffled science and investigation for many centuries. Today there are vast libraries written on the sub\u00ac ject of this body and its remarkable operations, and yet we are hardly on the threshold of knowing the truth. Much is known, so much that a great public building could not hold all the works that relate to this knowledge; and yet less than one per cent, of the truth has been reached. And, whereas, a few years ago one doctor covered all the practice of his pro\u00ac fession, now there are specialists who are trained by years of study each in some subdivision of the body; a specialist for the dis\u00ac eases of the stomach, one for the heart, one for the liver, one for the lungs, one for the eyes, one for the throat, one for the nerves, and so on through the whole list. Still the wonders grow. If you go into a hospital you will be amazed at the great volumes and the myriad implements and instruments that have been produced in the cause of curing the ills of the human body; and you will ask yourself the question. Did Nature when she created this temple of life intend all this elaboration of science and invention to save the body from the grave? The increase of 108 PERSONAL BOOK books, of drugs, of apparatus, of instruments, of treatments, has kept pace with the advance of civilization; and which is the cause of the other? Is civilization the cause of all the diseases that now over\u00ac whelm the human race? In the simplicity of Nature, far away from all the skill of doctors and surgeons, it is possible to live long and live well. Yet the skill of doctors and surgeons is helping humanity in straits where no other help is available. It all seems a mystery. It sounds like a paradox to say that doctors and surgeons are saving life and doing a vast deal of good in the world, despite (the fact that the numbers of medical books, medical apparatus, surgical instru\u00ac ments, hospitals, drugs and treatments are increasing all the time, and patients are increasing all the time. There are more sick people than ever before. Vitality is lower than ever before, doc\u00ac tors, surgeons and treatments are far more numerous than ever before; and yet they are all doing more good than ever before. You cannot find fault with the doctors and surgeons because they are increasing rapidly every year. Their services are in de\u00ac mand. Yet woe to the person who must be doctored! Far away from all this influence of science and skill, or knife and drug, even in the heart of a great nation, even in the region of a vast population, but far outside the pales of the baleful science of medicine, there is the simplicity of Nature that takes care of all its followers and bids them fear no illness. The commonest fault of the masses of sufferers is their lack of knowledge of the operations of Nature in the life of the body; and to teach this knowledge we present here the chart of the Sev\u00ac enteen Wonders of human life. Each wonder is briefly described, but in such a way that you ought never again to abuse the power it brings to you. If you will turn to the next page you will find small lines near the seventeen wonders. Follow the extent of each line so that you will see to what inner part of the body it leads. The arms and legs are the only parts of the temple of life that do not contain vital organs. All the regions above the hips are filled with vital operations. Everywhere organs are present, and every organ is surrounded by a membrane that brings electrical power into the organ and thus maintains its energy. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 109 CHART OF LIFE. SEVENTEEN WONDERS OF THE BODY. 110 PERSONAL BOOK ! First Wonder.\u2014This is found in the surrounding mem\u00ac branes of the brain, which are three in number and lie directly under the skull. When they are active the brain is at work, either day or night, in wakefulness or sleep. When the mind is at work, a flow of mucus is poured from these membranes into the brain; and the blood, by its increased circulation, brings additional nutrition to feed the work of this organ. The phos\u00ac phate foods serve to maintain the health and strength of the brain better than any other class. The best brain food is whole wheat deprived of its coarse bran. Bran itself sometimes has clinging to it a phosphatic meal which is used in bran-lemonade. The three membranes that surround the brain are known as meninges, and when they are inflamed by breathing foul air which carries germs into the general circulation of the blood, the dis\u00ac ease is known as meningitis. In crowded tenements and in badly ventilated houses, it is a common malady, and is often fatal. The best method of prevention is outdoor life free from road dust; and indoor life where pure food and cleanly methods are found! Living in dusty rooms is dangerous. All in-door dust is laden with disease. 2.\u2014Second Wonder.\u2014The thinking brain next claims our attention. It consists of convolutions that nearly fill the skull. They are located at the head of the spinal column, which is the seat of life. The spine feeds all the organs, and extends from the highest to the lowest. Its vitality travels with the demands made upon it; as when the mind is very active the stomach cannot digest its food; for the vitality will not supply both functions at the same time. 3 .\u2014Third Wonder.\u2014The little brain comes next. It is the dark mass at the base of the skull at the back. It is called the cerebellum; while the thinking brain is called the cerebrum. The little brain attends to all muscular activities of the whole body that are voluntary, which means all the things you do either from choice or from habit. The big brain thinks out what you decide to do in work or in play, and the small brain executes every command of the big brain. What the latter begins and repeats, the little brain will in time catch up and proceed with of itself, not waiting to be told by the cerebrum. If this were not so, you could never become skilled. If you play the piano and desire to put m motion more than one note at a time, as when cords RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 111 of six or eight notes are played, your thinking brain will not be aJble to attend to all these activities, for it cannot think of so many things in a fraction of a second. Hence the small brain, which controls all the muscles of the body, will do all the execu\u00ac tion required if it is given practice enough. This is why many hours a week of practice is necessary to make you an accomplished player. The same law holds true in all matters of skill. 4. \u2014Fourth Wonder.\u2014If you will look at the front of the CHART OF LIFE you will see the opening at the forehead where the eye is set. It conveys information to the brain, and there\u00ac fore leads directly into that great organ. What reaches 'the eye stimulates the brain, and by that means reaches the spinal column and extends to the stomach and all the organs. If you see on food something that displeases you, or the surroundings are unin\u00ac viting to the eye, the stomach will hold back its digestive juices and do harm to the health. Therefore one of the best steps in modern civilization is to bring pleasure to the stomach through cleanliness and neatness in the dining room, on the table and in the views round about. Hospital nurses know this law perfectly well and act upon it at all times. Cleanliness is inspiring. 5. \u2014Fifth Wonder.\u2014By following the fifth line on the Chart, you will note the entrance to the ear. It, too, is located so that its impressions reach directly into the brain and through that organ they affect the spinal column and the stomach. As life comes from food, it is important that eating should be aided by every pleasure possible. Hot all persons can have music near at hand during a meal, as is the custom in some homes, and in many hotels; but distracting noises may be avoided, and disagreeable conversation should be kept out of the dining room. Flowers please the eyes and their fragrance enters the brain by the nose; and there are ways of bringing pleasing sounds to the ears. Some persons love the song of birds, some the flowing brooks, some the sea-like sounds of rustling leaves, some the whole voice of nature; and these are a few of the ways in which summer days may be brought into the enjoyment of eating, even at the windows of the dining room. But the buzzing of flies and other insects, the discordant tones of scolding men and women, the shrill shrieks of bad-mannered children, and the horrible din of dirty city life can never bring health through the organ of hearing. 112 PERSONAL BOOK 6.\u2014Sixth Wonder.\u2014You would never for a moment think that the nasal passage is a wonder. Wait a moment. The disease of diphtheria is one of the most deathly and most to be feared of all maladies that take an epidemic form. It begins in the throat and is caused by the dust laden air taken in at the mouth on which the germs of disease are borne to the delicate membrane at the back wall of the throat where they begin to build colonies and increase very fast. In the nasal chamber, the Sixth Wonder, there is a great sponge, put there by Nature to save human life. If children and older persons are taught to inhale through the nose, there will never be a case of diphtheria, or other throat disease; nor a case of pneumonia or consumption. The germs float on indoor dust, and can get to a person in no other way. In schools where diph\u00ac theria epidemics have prevailed, all children have escaped who have been rigidly trained to inhale through the nose; even in play and in running, when much air is needed, it is possible to maintain nose\u00ac breathing. The great nasal chamber 7.\u2014Seventh Wonder.\u2014The upper throat is the resonance chamber of the voice, in connection with the nasal chamber just described. It is in the upper throat that catarrh lodges at a place where it is hard to get at. As all catarrhs begin by the bad habit of mouth breathing, the most natural Particle of Dust Highly cure is to cultivate the good habit of \"arfie\"Con ^surface dSe nose inhalation. When the upper fumption, la ^ippe^' small- throat is blocked by mucus, you cannot ffir\"2et8es8carl't feTer and sing in clear tones or speak with the lesonance that is necessary to a good voice. But the greater danger is the formation of catarrh that drops eventually to the lungs and stomach. By so doing it carries disease-germs to vital organs and may set up fatal maladies there. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 113 8. \u2014Eighth Wonder.\u2014This happy provision of Nature should be studied in connection with the nasal chamber and the upper throat. The hard palate, which is shown by the number 8, is a very hard bone, probably the hardest in the body. It is a sound\u00ac ing board. Your piano has a sounding board, and a resonant chamber; so has the violin, and so have all musical intruments that are musically pleasing. The roof of the mouth consists of a very hard bone which is covered by a thin membrane. The bone is soft at the back, as, we shall see, but it becomes harder and thicker as it proceeds for\u00ac ward to the front upper teeth. In speaking and in singing, you can throw your tones at will, after a little practice, at whatever part of the sounding board you please. If you are gloomy and sad. Nature will cause you to make known this fact by throwing your voice against the soft or back part of the palate, where a deep, or dull, moanful sound will be made. You may be sad and a trained singer, and so be able at will to throw your voice for\u00ac ward against the front part of the hard palate, where the tones will be bright. But this is art and not nature. You may thus conceal your real moods. Some persons are natural actors. As every musical instrument must have a sounding board, so there must be a resonant chamber close to it; and the upper throat and nasal cavity furnish the resonant chamber for the hard palate. 9. \u2014Ninth Wonder.\u2014This is the snoring attachment known as the uvula. If you will look into a mirror with your mouth wide open, you will see this little tongue hanging down at the back end of the hard palate. People who breathe in through the mouth are troubled with the hanging down of the soft palate or uvula. In speaking, yon will raise it a little, or you would snore at every word you tried to speak. But when you go to sleep the uvula will drop down in the passage of the throat, and there vibrate, making the familiar sound of snoring. This is a fault, but very prevalent. It may be cured by doubling two new habits: a. \u2014First, learn to inhale all day long through the nose. The air can go out at the mouth, but it should never go in at the mouth. b. \u2014Second, learn to raise the soft palate as a constant habit. This is a necessity in singing. If you have a fine singing teacher, you will be taught to raise the soft palate and to become con- 114 PERSONAL BOOK scions of its position. The higher it is raised the more it en\u00ac larges the resonance chamber of the throat, and it is in this way that voices are increased in volume. These facts are very elemen\u00ac tary principles among accomplished instructors of singing. But they are most remarkable. 10.\u2014Tenth Wonder.\u2014The lower throat comes next, and plays a very important part in the health of the body. Here all the dust from mouth breathing is brought and lodged until it is dis\u00ac tributed into whatever part it is to set up maladies. Diphtheria begins here, as has been stated on a preceding page. But the germs of tuberculosis and of pneumonia, as well as grippe and other diseases, have their first camping ground in the lower throat. You can see that currents of air that have been inhaled through the mouth will naturally strike this part of the throat. All indoor air is laden with dust. You will never find such air free from it. If you must live in dusty rooms, or near dusty roads, increase your vitality and by that means drive off disease. But it is not true that children and invalids can control their vitality unless they become Balstonites, and they should be taught to keep out dust- germs by inhaling always through the nose. Day habits of inhala\u00ac tion soon become night habits; for what you do all day long as a habit is adopted by the little brain and made a night habit as well. 11-\u2014Eleventh Wonder.\u2014We come now to the tongue and tonsils, and nearby are the glands that carry on mouth digestion, the most powerful of all curative measures. Dust from mouth\u00ac breathing will set up irritation and inflammation of the tonsils, and this too may be prevented by nose-breathing. Some of the infantile maladies are caught in the same way. The tongue is the seat of the fourth sense. We have seen the eye as the first sense, the ear as the organ of the second sense, the nose as the organ of the third sense; and now we have the tongue as the seat of taste. The whole muscular and nervous system of the body constitutes the fifth sense, touch. The tongue and its glands must be pleased with the taste of the food given it. As the eye, the ear and the nose may find something inviting or repugnant in connection with the eating of food, so the tongue and the palate may be aided or shocked by the flavor of the eatables offered. Thus all four senses help to make appetite. It has been well proved that the process of digestion is checked, stopped, or made energetic through these agencies. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 115 12. \u2014Twelfth Wonder.\u2014We now find the vocal cords and the swallowing gate demanding onr attention. Nature is economical. She uses the same thing for two or more purposes, as may be seen in the study of the palate and the nasal chamber. The throat becomes divided into two parts; one is the passage to the stomach, and this will be seen in the Chart as located close to the spinal column. The other is the passage to the lungs, and is shorter. Fresh, pure air is needed to put oxygen into the blood so that it will have the power of motion to distribute its nutrition as it cir\u00ac culates to all parts of the body. To get air to the lungs, the throat is divided into the two passages described. If you swallow anything, even a drop of water, and it does not take the back pas\u00ac sage, you may strangle. A fine piece of meat fibre, no larger than a small hair, has caused death. It is very necessary to let the air enter the front passage, but that must be tightly closed when you swallow any food or liquid. This swallowing gate is the epiglottis, or little cover over the glottis which is the entrance to the windpipe. Under the gate we find the two muscles made of cartilage which vibrate into tones either of song or speech. Vowels are made by shaping the tone column as it passes through the mouth; and consonants are produced by methods of interference with the tone column, as by the teeth, lips, and tongue; but the beginning of sound is at the glottis edges just under the swallowing gate. 13. \u2014Thirteenth Wonder.\u2014The passage in the throat under the swallowing gate, is known as the windpipe. It leads to the lungs. If catarrhs are allowed to remain in the throat, or if mouth-breath\u00ac ing is not cured, it is only a question of time when disease germs, floating on dust, will find lodgment there and set up sore throat, or some other troublesome affection. Here the terrible malady of asthma begins, and from this very cause. Here tuberculosis, trac\u00ac ing its track down from the dust left in the throat, will softly and insidiously wend its way to the lungs where it will very soon set up a domain that is hard to overthrow. The throat is the key to life and death. 14. \u2014Fourteenth Wonder\u2014 As the windpipe reaches the lungs it proceeds in branches which are called the bronchial tubes, to enter the greatest organ of life in the body. Here the dreaded disease, known as bronchitis, is set up. It always is a heritage of mouth-breathing. 116 PERSONAL BOOK The lungs themselves are now reached. Of all the deaths of people above the age of eighteen years, more than fifty in a hun\u00ac dred go to their graves from some form of lung disease. Here the vital\u00ac ity is made to show its greatest powers or its most depressing losses. The act of breathing is the act of life. You may cease its process for a short time, but not for The Lungs and Bronchial Tubes. many seconds without dis\u00ac tress. It is possible to hold the breath for a minute or two; but Hature never holds it in absolute cessation very long. Yet when a person is low in spirits, the respiration is very feeble, hardly noticeable by an observer. So when the attention is wrapt, as in some game or in a theatre. To overcome these bad habits, it is best to increase the natural respiration by two or three hundred per cent. This means that a person who inhales a gallon of air in a certain time, may be taught, or may learn, to inhale three gallons of air in the same time. 15. \u2014 Fifteenth Wonder.\u2014 Located in the midst of the lungs is the heart, that wonder\u00ac ful engine, the strongest for its size of all the engines in the world, which begins to beat long before birth and which never ceases until the spirit goes forth to the unknown world beyond. Ho one can tell what makes it beat. The sur\u00ac prising fact is that it keeps going. Yet it never once stops during life. Interior of heart, showing sections. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 117 FRONT VIEW OF THE VITAL ORGANJS Situation of the stomach and i ts surroundings. D, The Liver. 5' LuP\u00a7s- E, Large Intestine. C, Stomachy G, Small Intestine. The above illustration is placed here in order to make clear by a front view, the situation and relation of all the parts that are involved in the processes of respiration, circulation and diges\u00ac tion. 16.\u2014Sixteenth Wonder.\u2014The dark, back passage from the throat is seen in the Chart coursing down by the edge of the spinal column to the stomach where it enters. Here the con\u00ac tents of the mouth, passing the swallowing gate, are drawn to the organ of digestion. This organ rests close to the spinal column which contains the monumental pile of vital energies, and close communication is set up with the mouth, the brain and the senses; all of which affect and control digestion. See Chart of Life on page 109. 118 PERSONAL BOOK Inside View of the Stomach. One of the glands that secrete the gastric juice, magnified 150 diameters. The interior of the organ that receives all food and liquid is shown in the accompanying illus\u00ac tration; and the outside view of the same organ is seen near it. It must be understood that the most important process of life is that which builds the body, and gives it all its powers for self-sustaining and for the work and duties of liv\u00ac ing. What a man eats, that is he. But what a man digests deter\u00ac mines what he is in a different meaning. Food that the stomach will not act upon is better out of the body than in it. Digestion is controlled at the mouth, is set in motion by the glands that secrete the gastric juice, and is aided by the walls of the stomach. Until the taste-buds of the tongue and the mouth glands are aroused, there can be no activity of the glands that secrete the gastric juice, and all food that enters an inactive stomach will ferment and set up poisons that lead to disease. Owing to the prevalence of food adulterations at the present day, almost every stomach is diseased. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 119 17.\u2014Seventeenth Wonder.\u2014The last in the nobler vital group is the spine, to which reference has already been made. If there is such a part of the body as the seat of life, it must be in the nervous system that centers here. Life itself is electrical, and here there are countless storage batteries, from which endless wires radiate to all parts of the body. As this column is made of many sections, it will bend easily and old age is shown most clearly by the curving of the back. This can easily be avoided, as there are many Ralstonites above the age of eighty who are as erect as young soldiers and in whom no trace of the feebleness of age can be found. The spinal column is affected most readily by the manner in which a person walks or sits. It is bad to lounge much of the time. Either lie flat on the back, or flat on one side, or prone on the stomach; but avoid the half sitting and the half lying position, as it brings the fluids into a partial stoppage, and weakness ensues. Paralysis has been instigated by the lounging habit. There is but one rule, and it is that the spine should be kept perfectly straight, either lying down or sitting up, or standing, or walking. Study this. The body has been so shaped that it is possible to sit in a chair and keep the spine straight. Easy chairs that permit leaning back are comfortable, but not beneficial. That which we most like to do, or to eat, does not always seem to have the endorse\u00ac ment of Nature. Keep the spine straight. In bed when ready to go to sleep, lie flat on the back if you have not ever-eaten at the noon or evening meal; otherwise die flat on the stomach, with the head on its side. A person who is nervous, or who does not fall to sleep readily, should lie in a prone position, with the weight on the front of the body. Never lie on the right or left side unless you have established such habit and can repose better that way. Protect the spine. In walking, be careful not to use the greatest pressure of the step on the heel. The heel should touch first, but the weight should quickly be carried over to the front of the foot on every step. This takes the jar and strain from the spinal column; and, after a person gets used to it, weariness in walking will be unknown, and the vitality of the whole body will be greatly increased. 120 PERSONAL BOOK In and around the spinal column there are countless cells where human electricity is being stored every minute of life if the vital\u00ac ity is good. Out from these cells a multitude of currents of elec\u00ac tricity are rushing to supply the body with its needed power of action. A bone cannot move of itself, and each of the two hun\u00ac dred bones of the body has two muscles, one to pull the bone one way, and another to pull it back. A muscle cannot move of itself. It must have some power to move it, and this power is present in the nerves that are attached to all muscles. The nerves are like wires over which electricity travels. While the bone does the physical work, and is moved by its muscles; while these muscles are directed by their nerves, and the nerves are furnished their power by human electricity, there can be no flow of such electricity until the brain sends forth the order to act. Thus we find the- engineer in charge of the most wonderful machine in the world; mechanism so marvelous that not even its simplest part can be imitated by the cleverest invention of man. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 121 Chapter Fifteen PERSONAL ADVICE On every highway in this life are dangerous curves and hidden tracts where death and wreckage lie in-wait: beware the sign! stop! look! and listen well! EFORE a person is sick there is a cause. If the person has been in good health, the cause has been invited by some act or habit that could have been prevented. Contagions may be headed off by a high vitality just as an iron tower will intercept a conflagration. In this chapter, the primitive laws of sickness and its causes will be considered. It is not therefore a part of the great work of Ralston Doctors that is described in the final pages of this book. 1. When the vitality is weak, nature sets up a warning either in the form of a headache or neuralgia. 2. Loss of vitality which is followed or attended by pains in the head or back or neck, should at once be treated by rest. A day sleep or rest for a few minutes, if repeated several times in the day, will break up that kind of suffering. 3. When chocolate of the adulterated kind is taken, there will be pains in the head the same day or the next day, and perhaps pain around the heart. Rest and the white of an egg will help; but the diet must be both wholesome and limited, and long mastica\u00ac tion is necessary for each mouthful taken. Stimulants will do no good. This rule applies to all forms of neuralgic pains that attend indigestion, as from eating pastry or crisp foods, or other harmful things. 4. When the heart is not normal in its action or gives a heavy or sharp pain, or beats rapidly, look to the diet. The causes may 122 PERSONAL BOOK be iced drinks, ice cream, fried foods, crisp foods, rich foods, coffee, substitutes for coffee, oat meal, a heavy dinner late in the day in place of a light supper, or other indiscretion. 5. Don't expect a good night's rest if you eat a meat meal late in the day. Insomnia cannot be cured in that way, and is gen\u00ac erally caused by such methods. 6. The natural cure of insomnia is to have simple, plain and wholesome foods thoroughly masticated in the mouth, and eaten ac\u00ac cording to the plan of this book. Meats and vegetables should never be eaten later than the noon meal. The non-use of the eyes and brain after the evening meal, the habit of remaining out of doors between the end of such meal and bed-time, and the drinking of a bowl of hot bouillon at the time of retiring, will restore the system to a normal condition and bring on sweet sleep. 7. Don't go without a meal unless you do so under a plan of health arranged according to scientific laws. To omit food and then crowd the system is slow suicide. 8. When you have come into possession of a keen appetite, treat it as the most welcome guest of your existence; for in that appetite may be found the key to any kind of health or body condi\u00ac tion that you desire. The worst thing you can do is to satisfy it with cheap or low grade food or rich stuff. Then is the time for creating a new body. 9. A cold is a fever intended by nature to bum up some excess of material in the system. As such process is aided by free perspi\u00ac ration and by deeper respiration, you should rest during the first approach of the cold, for during rest the pores of the skin are very active and the lungs breathe much more air than when you are sit\u00ac ting or standing. 10. The grippe is a cold with special germs at work to bring on serious results. It should be treated in the way just mentioned. We have known of case after case being headed off by instant rest and day sleep if possible. Reduce the diet to the whites of eggs and milk. 11. Contagions cannot be caught when the vitality is high. 12. As nearly all diseases arise from indoor dust or street dust blown in the house, there are two courses to pursue; one is to keep the dust out, and the other is to raise the state of the vitality to the highest degree, and then two defences will be made for the threat\u00ac ened maladies. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 123 13. Exercises are good under some circumstances; but men and women who are fully sedentary should not be given taxing exer\u00ac cises. After the age of forty, new muscular habits are not ad\u00ac vantageous. 14. Yet a person who has diabetes should be kept on the feet all the time, should not be allowed to sleep more than six hours at night, and never at day, and should be fed on a special diet. This treatment has saved many lives. 15. On the contrary a person who has consumption should not exercise at all. Every effort of the muscles breaks down tissue that is needed. Here the diet must be special. Rightly managed, there is hope of a cure in every case. But these instances are cited to show that, in one class of conditions, exercise is essential and in other cases it is often fatal. 16. If you have rheumatism look to your diet. No first class doctor attempts to cure either diabetes, consumption or rheumatism with internal medicines. \"It is criminal practice,\" says an expert in these maladies. 17. If you meet a man or woman with rheumatism or gout, or any kindred malady, you may ask with a certainty of receiving an affirmative reply, \"Do you eat fruit, especially apples?\" If the answer is no, then there will be found to be fibrous vegetables in the diet, such as beets, parsnips, turnips, pumpkins, radishes, cooked cabbage, or an excess of raw food. Pieplant is a common cause of the disease. Gooseberries as eaten in England are responsible for ninety per cent, of the rheumatism there, and the gouty habits of the people. It is the national fruit, and all acid. 18. The first principle in the cure of rheumatism is to stop the dietary cause and jump to an opposite diet. Relief comes al\u00ac most as by magic, and then the victim goes back to the fruit, vege\u00ac table or acid foods, with a new attack. Like neuralgia this disease can be controlled wholly by re-building the blood and body in the manner stated in the earlier part of this book. 19. When the lungs are weak or partly destroyed, the natural means of assisting them is by developing the unused cells of which there are countless thousands. This can be done by increasing the automatic habits of breathing so that three times as much air is taken into the lungs as formerly. Side-breathing, which expands the body under the arms to the right and left, reaches the new cells. No medicine or apparatus can be of help. 124 PERSONAL BOOK 20. Catarrh of the nose, throat or upper passages to the lungs can always be wholly cured by increased respiration and a plain diet of the proper kind. The extra amount of air dries up the mucus, as it is formed at the surface of the membranes; the volume of air taking it all away. 21. Appendicitis can be surely prevented by avoiding foods that contain preservatives. The latter are present in each kind of food in small quantities, and the government officials are inclined to believe that so slight a quantity cannot be very harmful The system might throw it off if it entered in only one thing; but it is present m meats, m canned goods, in package goods, in much of the milk, cheese, butter and cream in use, in preserves of all kinds, m ruit juices, m tinned tomatoes, in soups and vegetables that are put up m tins; and it is coming into flour, the staple of life. The wear and tear on the intestines is too great for nature to endure and the lining is eaten away or so irritated that it becomes in\u00ac flamed, with the result that appendicitis, the guardian of protec\u00ac tion from adulterations, is involved and must be cut out, leaving humanity no sentinel to take its place. 22. Many people who are predisposed to pneumonia have by building up an enormous lung capacity, driven away all tendencies to this fatal malady. 23. The hair and eyes follow the general condition of the blood m nine cases out of ten. There are, of course, exceptions. ut the oculist is enabled by looking at the eyes to detect the presence of blood disturbance, and kidney disease, as well as other troubles. The natural treatment is to be careful of the eyes to avoiding reading in twilight or by any light that is dim or that is in front of the face. Never read print that is too fine. Do not read on the cars or in any vehicle that is in motion. In proportion as the diet is plain and the variety of food less, the sight improves with care Fresh air m the house day and night, will also prove of help The hair needs good blood to feed it, good scalp conditions to grow it, and massage of the scalp to cultivate it; with many frequent washings to keep out the germs that destroy the roots. White beneficiaTaP' S\u00b0aP* ^ \u00b0r shnilar antisePtics are 24. Anaemia is the beginning of lungs and every organic trouble, as well loss of the red corpuscles in the blood. consumption, or of weak as blood disorders. It is a The eating of acids is one RALSTON HEALTH GLEB 125 common cause; such as vinegar, lemon juice, and the like. Girls who are addicted to the use of pickles, are always anaemic sooner or later. Another cause is the use of pastry and fried foods. 25. Actual experiments and observations show that nothing will break up the blood so quickly as pastry, rich cakes, piecrust, thin fried potatoes, and fermenting foods like ice cream. A person who has been cured of consumption should never eat any of this line of foods; for the malady will surely return. In tuberculosis the one fight is to keep the tissue from being lost; and pastry destroys tissue in well persons, so that it is sure to hurry the progress of this dread disease when once it has secured a hold on the system. 26. Avoid boiled water, and boiled foods, as they contain the dregs that make old age faster than any other cause. When the steam and vapor have gone from the contents, what remains should not be taken. 27. Paralysis comes generally from a draught. A person who is perfectly well, but whose vitality is low, may invite this malady by sitting at an open window, standing or sitting by an open door, or in some way becoming exposed to the cooler current of wind. It does not make any difference how mildly cool the current may be; if there is a difference between the air and the heat of the body, it will do possible harm. 28. Don't sit by an open car window, especially if it is one seat in front of you. The party who opened the window does not feel the draft for it blows backwards to the next seat behind. We have a record of several cases where exposure to the draft from an open car window has paralyzed the face of a person, or the side. 29. The ground is a conductor of human electricity, if there is the least dampness on it. A cold cement step, or stone step, or grassy bank will soon draw off your vitality. Look out for the party who wants you to stop and talk in cool or cold weather when the street or walk is cold or damp. Rubbers will protect you to a great extent; but leather shoes will not, and some of the worst colds have followed this habit of remaining standing even for a few minutes only, on cold walks. Dry wood is safer. 30. Do not linger in the open doorway to say a long goodby to some person. Pneumonia awaits you. The caller may have her wraps on and so not feel the exposure; but you have the warm room back of you and the cold air in front, while you are clothed for the room temperature. So look out. 126 PERSONAL BOOK 31. When you have dyspepsia, remember that this is a malady of the stomach, and the natural cure is to carry on digestion in the mouth by the buccal glands of the throat. If you do this, the stomach will have a rest and recover; but it must not be wholly empty when you are carrying on mouth digestion. The best food for it at such a time is the white of an egg taken at the rate of one every five minutes until you have finished the meal; but not more than four whites are to be used. If milk does not injure the stomach, or give it distress, you can whip the whites of two eggs in a glass of milk, and sip it during the meal. 32. But the process of creating a new body, as described in the earlier part of this book, is the best of all methods of overcoming dyspepsia. 33. If you have liver troubles, depend for some time on mouth digestion, as this stimulates the third brain which controls the liver and kidneys, as well as other organs. 34. If you have kidney troubles, avoid alcohol, and all bever\u00ac ages except distilled water. 35. Hardening of the liver follows the use of alcohol; and is a very common disease at the present day. 36. A person who is subject to sun heat and the fear of stroke, should avoid in the summer time all forms of corn meal foods, all alcohol, all fats and heavy meals. The eating should be light, and distilled water should be the only drink. 37. Don't drink water that you know nothing about. Over three-fourths of typhoid in the cities comes from people who have been away on a vacation of a week or more; although one drink from an infected well is enough to start the trouble. 38. Don't drink raw milk that you know nothing about. While it is much better than sterilized milk as a food, it is not safe to take when human life is at stake; therefore let it be brought to the boiling point and then made ice cold before it is drunk. 39. All raw vegetables, fruits and other things should be thor\u00ac oughly washed and cleaned before being eaten; as dust and insects cover them with germs of disease. 40. Don't drink much liquid when you are warm; hold the fluid in the mouth as long as you can and the thirst will be quenched. 41. Don't take a bath on a full stomach, as the nervous system suffers a shock that sometimes causes paralysis. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 127 42. Don't take a cold water bath if you are very irritable or nervously weak. The sudden attack on the vitality saps the nerve centres of their best life. It is said that there are no cold water bathers who are not very nervous. Many of them have died of nervous prostration. The better way is to bathe in tepid water, and rinse off in water that is slightly cooler which may be gradually changed to cold water. This prevents loss of vitality by the shock of a cold dash or plunge. 43. Don't wear slippers when you have been accustomed to high shoes; the vitality is lessened and colds ensue by the exposure to the cold strata of the room near the floor. A person who is used to slippers or low shoes might not suffer; but high shoes are a means of protection against colds. 44. Don't wear thin soled shoes out of doors. The feet are close to the ground and the body's electricity will escape very easily if there is an opportunity. The people who wear thick soles are better able to ward off a cold or the grippe. 45. When the stomach is empty don't put anything in the mouth that is not to be swallowed, as it causes the gastric juices to flow, and these act in a digestive manner on the walls of the stomach, causing great redness and incipient inflammation. 46. Don't smoke on an empty stomach; it will do the thing just described, and also will make you nervous. 47. Don't chew anything when the stomach is empty. Swal\u00ac lowing the saliva will not suffice, as that fluid passes into the glands and does not reach the stomach. 48. Don't go out of doors with insufficient clothing on. Change the garments to suit the changes in temperature. In winter, wear suitable undershirts and vary them with the warmth and cold. Have three weights; one very heavy, one medium, and one very light. Do not take off the underwear too soon in spring. It is better to suffer from heat than from pneumonia. 49. Don't wear next to the skin any wool or flannel. Open mesh goods are safest and best. 50. Don't remain in a cold room without putting on extra wraps. The lower the temperature, the more clothing you should wear. 51. In cold weather the best health is secured when the arti\u00ac ficial heat of the house is lowered, and the natural heat of the body is increased by wearing double undervests. 128 PERSONAL BOOK Chapter Sixteen \"LAWS OF LIFE\" FOR YOU Youth is not rich in time, it may be poor: Part with it as with money, sparing ; pay No moment but in purchase of its worth : And what's its worth ask death-beds, they can tell. )U have reached that stage in your earthly existence where you realize the importance of knowing the exact needs of your body. If you have always been well, and are still well, you understand the value of maintaining the good health with which you are blessed. Prevention is better than cure, and this fact y'ou are wise enough to appreciate. If, on the other hand, there have taken place in your body certain organic changes, or your blood has begun to fail, or your vitality to weaken, it is all the more impor\u00ac tant that you should know what to do to check the advance of disease or the invitation of premature death. The moment you were born there began the road-building of your journey to the grave. When you were only twenty-four hours old, you were one day nearer death. So all through your infancy and youth, even through the years in which you were robust and full of the vigor of life, the influences that break down the health and sap the vitality, were engaged in hurrying you on to that end from which there is no escape. As all nature ripens and dies in her created forms of life, so all humanity has come to expect ripening and death. What is most feared is the breaking down of the faculties and the decrep\u00ac itude and helplessness of infirm age. \"I would rather go to my grave at the end of maturity than to live on and on in weakness RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 129 and dependence/' is the thought of almost every man and woman when age begins to show itself. It is an awful thing to be old and decrepit. It is an awful fate to lose sight, or hearing, to find all the senses failing, and the body stiff with senile decay, while one lives on and on in uselessness and helplessness. Yet Nature says, \"Decreptitude is a crime.\" The explanation is this: Decreptitude is unnecessary, and is therefore an imposition on those who must take care of you. If you are now decrepit and helpless, come into the Giant Liaws of Life here and now and throw off the burden. Live! Live anew! There are four roads to death. You may be traveling on one, or two, or three, or all of them at this time. Find out the facts. Know yourself, and see what of these roads you have been journey\u00ac ing on, and how far you have progressed. THE FOUR ROADS TO DEATH: 1. STIFFENING. 2. CLOGGING. 3. POISONING. 4. WEAKENING. A full explanation of what is meant by the terms used will be given here, and then you must analyze your own condition by the rules that will follow these accounts. First Road to Death. \u2014 STIFFENING. \u2014 What ultimately bends the hack and takes the elasticity out of the body, is a tendency that begins the day one is bom. It comes from the conditions that surround the life of every person in the battle for food. When the race came on earth it was in need of sustenance, and Nature supplied many things in the crudest forms. If a man is ship\u00ac wrecked on a wild island he will first seek water and food. He cannot go without them for many days. The water may be at hand or far away. Once he secures it and learns its source, he will dwell as near the locality ,as possible. Then he must find his food. There may be birds, fish, animals, fruits or other forms of sustenance about him; lacking all of which !he will eat grass and leaves like the lower animals. The same conditions have confronted humanity from the beginning of time. The use of more refined forms of food is always developed from crude supplies. But wherever it is found it is a gift of the earth. Fish have eaten food that originated in some way in the earth; so have animals whose meat man eats. 130 PERSONAL BOOK And so have birds. All have been fed by the product of the soil. The latter is largely mineral. In fact it is all mineral at the start, and has become blended into nutritive forms by the aid of animal life. Then whatever you eat, comes from the soil, and you cannot escape the mineral nature out of which it is extracted. Nature has never done for man what he has been able to do for himself. She has never discovered for him the laws or the secrets that have been most useful to him as he has marched onward along the grand highway of civilization. He has had to do everything for himself, and so he has suffered. The food is in the soil, and he must get it out. It is mixed with the soil, and man eats soil when he eats any kind of food. There is nothing that enters his stomach that does not contain some soil, some minerals, some cal\u00ac careous matter that is sure to remain in his veins and tissue, and sooner or later stiffen his body. This is the whole secret. The day will come when man will discover something more than his wizard genius has yet found out; he will learn how to get the food from the earth free from this soil. But today he is still ignorant of the fact. When, however, he does learn this great solution of life, he will effectually close up one of the Four Toads to Death. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 131 As it is, he eats every day some soil. It is mineral, and like any mineral it stays in fine deposits in the body, gradually interfering with the operations of life and bringing on stiffness and infirmity. There are millions of persons who are never ill, but who become aged and still in all parts of the body; developing this condition so gradually as to escape notice until they are decrepit. They die of old age after many years of help\u00ac lessness and dependence, with faculties impaired and body almost useless. It is the mineral matter in their food that has done all this harm. The veins of the heart, of the eyeballs, of the ears, of the whole structure of ,i , The solids and liquids that the body everywhere, are very small, enter the stomach have great They throb and urge onward the rush influence on the health of the i\u00bb r-i t n , ,, , kidneys. When these organs Ol blood through the system. You can are once broken down there easily see the damage that is done when is no cure- Medicines make i-t . . -| . them worse. the inside surfaces of these tiny veins are lined with deposits of mineral matter that is taken in through the food and water. There are some children who show traces of age in their youth; there are many young men and women who are growing old in their veins too soon; and all persons eventu\u00ac ally succumb to this adanvcing process of undue ripening long before they are old enough in Nature to die. It is not a theory but a proved fact that youthful conditions should endure long past a hundred years. You may be traveling this Boad to Death, or you may have come upon one or more of the shorter ones. In any case, get away from all. They are unnatural. Second Road to Death.\u2014CLOGGING.\u2014While stiffening is due to an excess of mineral matter in food and drink, clogging is due to the collection of animal soil in the blood, tissue and all organs. This animal soil is the breakdown of the food that is eaten. Nutri\u00ac tion is extracted and carried into the circulation by the blood, and brought to bear upon all parts within the system so that they may be built up rapidly and effectively. But when they have served their purpose, then they break down and become a burden to the 132 PERSONAL BOOK blood. This fluid must bring in the building material, and it must carry out the debris or ruins of inward life. Effects of Clogging the Kidneys. The above picture, taken from actual photograph, shows the dead animal soil collected around the kidneys and adjacent parts. It was the cause of death. All blood therefore that flows in your veins is carrying new material to every portion of your body, and is taking out the break\u00ac down of life. The two go together, except that as soon as the blood can take the worn out material to the lungs, or to the skin, or to the kidneys, or other parts, it lets it go. This is the hardest of all the processes of life, and is the cause of all diseases; or at least it is the first cause. If you are careful to eat only as much as the* body requires, and to select no poisons in what you eat and drink, you will find that the blood will carry the two burdens in perfect manner. But you cannot escape poisons, as they blend with all foods, and with most liquids, nor can you guage your appetites unless you are able to ascertain with scientific accuracy how much is required to satisfy ninety per cent, of your hunger, leaving the remaining ten per cent, for an attractive force for the next meal. As you cannot do these perfect things, there is but result, and that is an excess of material that will clog the system. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 133 This clogging manifests itself in two ways: 1. In constipation. 2. In dead soil deposits all through the body. Both conditions are serious. One period of constipation, while apparently very harmless, tells a story that should he heeded at the very outset. Organs suffer losses that can be repaired only by the best methods in after years. Constipation gives due notice of trouble! but dead animal soil is hardly ever detected except by a faulty complexion and unpleasant breath; but even these indica\u00ac tions are sometimes faint and not understood. The light field of the eyeball which surrounds the iris, and which is known as the white of the eye, begins to lose its beautiful clearness as soon as the accumulation of dead animal soil throughout the whole body reaches a condition that threatens health. Dead animal soil covers the heart, is present all through the' lungs, coats the stomach, clouds the kidneys, clogs the liver, and interferes with the normal processes of life. It is dead matter, and dead animal matter at that. Nature never allows dead matter of any kind to remain. She will send carrion flies or insects or birds to consume a dead horse, or a dead rat, or a dead piece of meat, or manure, or any offal that is left to itself. There are many kinds of decay in the body as in outer life; and Nature creates just the kind of bac\u00ac teria to devour it. If you have an accumulation of a certain kind of decay in your body, there will he bacteria ready to enter and devour it. Thus when the decay is of the kind that is devoured by germs of small pox, such bacteria will enter if they are available, and eat up all that kind of decay. When it is devoured, you will not be attacked by small pox again for many years. The prin\u00ac ciple of vaccination is to send into the blood a mild imitation of small pox in harmless germs that feed on the same kind of decay; and the result is in most cases that you will have no decay left in your body on which the real germs, or bacteria, of small pox can feed. The vaccine bacteria have cleaned up all that kind of dead animal soil, and that special kind accumulates very slowly. Other kinds of dead soil accumulate very much faster. The soil for typhoid bacteria comes in every day, and one attack does not insure the body against other attacks of this malady. Excess of dead animal soil in the system results in the attacks of bacteria to devour such decay, as Nature does not permit effete 134 PERSONAL BOOK matter to remain anywhere. Diseases, therefore, are Nature's method of getting rid of the clogging material in the body. The doctors guessed this truth many centuries ago, and all physicians are so-called because they are physickers. The first step in any cure is to open the pores, increase both the respiration and the perspiration, free the bowels and make the kidneys active; all of which methods serve to hurry the dead animal soil out of the body so that it can no longer furnish food for the bacteria of disease. It seems very simple. But the danger is that the germs of disease, having begun to feed on the dead animal soil, will in\u00ac clude the healthful parts as well, and death too often follows. There are two causes of clogging: 1. Too much food. 2. Unfit food. Both causes are present in the habits of the well to do classes. Two Hairs of the Head Highly Magnified These two pictures are very interesting. They show two hairs of the head, and the structure of the roots. One hair is clean at the scalp; the other is clogged, and will fall out because of the animal soil that is destroying it. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 135 third Road to Death.\u2014POISONING.\u2014This does not mean acute poisoning, but the steady, daily taking into the system of material that is not food, most of which slowly changes the nature of the tissue in the organic life of the bod}7\", and makes the blood a burden carrier instead of a wholesome river of nutrition. A large margin is allowed bj7, Nature for the disposal of this class of slow poisons. While a little hurts, a little more hurts more, and a small increase carried on day by day becomes an ac\u00ac cumulation of dangers, each of which is too slight to be regarded with fear. The word antiseptic seems a long one for a common mind to grasp, but it means something that destroys the germs of dis\u00ac ease, or the germs of decay. Milk decays by souring, and anti\u00ac septic chemicals are put in it to prevent or delay such decay. Millions of children have been killed to satisfy the greed of farm\u00ac ers and middlemen who seek to cover up habits of gross unclean\u00ac liness in handling milk. Yet without milk in some form, the human race w'ould die out in a short time. Hams, salt pork, and cured meats are treated with the coars\u00ac est kind of antiseptics; the grade of salt used is the most deadly of slow poisons, and people who eat meats that are not fresh will pay the penalty sooner or later. But fresh meats are embalmed. This is done by the use of chemical antiseptics. It is a crime, but the meat packers laugh at the law, and the people are help\u00ac less. Post-mortem examinations of the intestines of people who have been excessive meat-eaters show the presence of bacteria in great quantities of the most putrid kind; while similar exami\u00ac nations of non-meat-eaters show great comparative cleanliness. It is the accumulation of so-called \"safe\" poisons that do the greatest harm. Thus the can of tomatoes that you buy at the store contains so little chemical preservative that it will not do your body any harm in one sense of the word. It will never make you ill. The saccharine that is put in sugars, candies, and the fruit syrups of soda water fountains, as well as in glassed and tinned fruits and other goods, and even in the infant foods will not do you any immediate harm; that is, it will not kill you by acute poisoning. Yet in time your kidneys, without warning, will break down, and Bright's disease, the incurable monster, will come upon you as in a night. 136 PERSONAL BOOK The above picture represents the actual size of the human heart (from a correct photographic view taken immediately after death) reduced or shrunken by atrophy, and due to taking antiseptic medicines which destroyed the healthful cells while overcoming germ disease. The medicines, the hundreds of thousands of barrels of which are taken annually by the great American people, are caught up by the blood; and, as some calculate, in every fifty- eight pulse-beats, the entire blood of the system passes through the heart. When this organ is affected, every organ and every function of the body suffers, and ill-health results. The pure food laws of State and United States are laughed at by all makers of tinned and glassed goods, and by almost all makers of package foods. The rapid increase of infantile paraly\u00ac sis, and of appendicitis, can be traced to the use of preparations in foods and liquids, of chemicals where Nature intended only her natural growth, and of preservatives that kill bad bacteria while killing good tissue. If infantile paralysis, which slays old, middle-aged and young with equal celerity and leaves no victim well who survives, were to become suddenly a world-wide epidemic, as a rebuke to the greed classes who thrive on the murder of humanity, it might wake up the people to a campaign of annihilation of these crimi- RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 137 nal adulterators; but nothing short of a cataclysm can effect this needed end. The whole race is falling backward as the result of adulterations in food and drink. But who cares? Does the increase of doctors, of drugs, of hospitals, of operations, of uni\u00ac versal weakness and half-sickness all over the land arouse any interest in the study of their causes? Very little, if any. People who, becoming poisoned by adulterated foods and drinks, find themselves victims of some kind of breakdown, fly at once to drugs and patent medicines; thus adding quickly to the dangers of acute poisoning of some organ, notably the stomach, the heart, the kidneys, or the lung tissue; and so they drag along a miserable existence until death releases them or they invite it directly. All foods contain more than food value, and Nature makes her allowance great enough to permit the excess to be carried out by the intestines. But the chemical poisons that are found in almost all drinks, even well water, coffee, tea, and bottled liquids; and in all canned, tinned, and glassed goods, and package- foods; in all drugs and patent medicines; in syrups, fruit ex\u00ac tracts, candies, chocolates and everything that can be treated by the adulterator, furnish a mass of material that does not do enough immediate harm to bring the culprits to justice as mur\u00ac derers, but enough to undermine the best of human health. Meat is embalmed. Baking powders contain alum. Most flour is bleached or otherwise doctored. On the altar of greed all life is made a cheap sacrifice. The methods of deceiving the public are so intricate that only experts ean create them and detect them. The mind gives way under the influence of these combined poisons, and the power to resist the temptation of self-destruc\u00ac tion is lost. Insanity and suicides have increased at a fearful rate in the past twelve months, and will continue to increase until food adulteration is made what it in fact is\u2014a capital offence. The slow poisoner is as wicked as the quick poisoner. The slow murderer is as much a felon as the quick murderer. Adulterators grown rich live in homes of opulence made possi\u00ac ble only under a system of felonies by which untold numbers of victims sleep in crime-made graves. Fourth Road to Death.-WE.AKENING.-This is the ap\u00ac proach of nervous weakness or low vitality that withdraws from 138 PERSONAL BOOK the body the electrical energy that supports all the operations of life. This force is created in the body every minute and its de\u00ac velopment depends on the health of the nerves themselves and of the nutrition that supplies them. Man is like a plant in his vitality. The plant that droops must be given sunlight in medium power, and fresh air without being subjected to harsh winds. What was once largely outdoor life has in recent years become indoor life. The office has taken the place of the held. The woman who used to have a garden and who did much of her housework by the open window or on the porch, has been succeeded by the woman who shuts herself in all day. The carriage and the wagon have given way to the closed car, or to the automobile that admits no chance for deliberate en\u00ac joyment of the fresh air. The odor of gasoline poisons the heart and weakens the lungs, while speed in travel through the open air breaks down the vitality very fast. These last statements are challenged by automobile owners; but doctors tell their neu\u00ac rasthenic patients to avoid automobile riding. The only point we make here is that human life depends as much on fresh air and mellow sunlight as the favorite plant; and modem methods of living are constantly narrowing the scope of outdoor life by increasing indoor habits and occupations. This fact, together with the ever-growing array of injurious chemicals that are entering the body through the impure foods and drinks now m use, makes such inroads on the vitality that the power to resist disease, and to combat its crisis, is being lost. Nervous prostration claims today a hundred victims where fifty years ago it destroyed the life of only one. The constant feeling of nervous depression brings on mental gloom and despondency', enemies of health and of enjoyable living. When a person see? no object m earthly existence, then the mind is diseased: and there is an ever-increasing army of men and women who think this life is not worth the living. One of the most remarkable effects is that of weakening that attends mental discouragement. Enthusiasm and optimism build vitality; but the depressed person actually seems to be without reath, so slight is the action of the lungs and the beating of the Heart* Death comes from the of the body, as often as it running down of the storage battery comes from distinct disease. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 139 SEVEN ROADS TO LIFE. Thus far in this chapter we have presented the Four Roads to Death along one or more of which you are traveling at this moment. No one pretends that death is not a certainty. If so, there must be some process by which it is reached, and we have shown four of these processes. Opposed to these roads there are Seven Roads to Life, and they are described in the following pages with their relationship made clear as far as they are able to offset the highways of death. 1. DISTILLATION. 2. ELIMINATION. 3. PERSISTALSIS. The Seven Roads to Life 4. NON-CLOGGING FOODS. 5. INGESTION. 6. OPEN-SKIN. 7. DEEP RESPIRATION. First Road to Life.\u2014DISTILLATION.\u2014All Nature in her own departments, proceeds to effect her results through her law of distillation. Her fruits contain distilled liquid. She takes the vapor from the ocean and raises it to the sky freed from salt and all impurities. Vapor is pure. It floats inland, meets cold cur\u00ac rents of air, and falls in the form of rain or snow, both distilled. This is ideal drinking water when collected and given proper care. Nature causes boiling water to send forth vapor which, when it is condensed, is pure water. This is called artificial distillation; but it is of the same good quality as rain water when it is sub\u00ac jected to pure air for aeration, and it employs a great law of Nature in its production. The chief quality of distilled water is that it contains no mineral matter and therefore cannot cause stiffening of the veins in the body or any of its organs. The next quality of such water is its constant action of absorbing impurities whenever it comes in contact with them. It is a quick cleanser. The person who drinks rain water, or distilled water is sure to retain youth many, many years longer than the person who drinks hard water with its mineral matter. Second Road to Life.\u2014ELIMINATION.\u2014The many fruits furnished by Nature for the use of man have a distinct purpose in the world. They not only contain distilled water, hut also hold 140 PERSONAL BOOK qualities that serve to draw from the body the accumulated min\u00ac eral matter that causes stiffening. The great varieties of fruits teach the lesson of selection. By this is meant that one fruit is good for one person and another fruit is good for another person; or that one fruit aids one part of the body and another fruit aids another part. To illustrate what is meant we will take the use of the well known grape fruit, which is a bitter orange-looking ball of greater size. It holds a large quantity of juice. The pulp is injurious. Let the liquid part be eaten by a spoon, evading the fibre of the flesh, and avoiding the aid of sugar, and the liver will be given a wonderful cleansing in the course of ten days. This juice should be taken mornings on an empty stomach fully thirty minutes be\u00ac fore breakfast. The habit of taking it as the first or fruit course at the morning meal, is wrong; as is also the habit of taking grape fruit at other times of the day. The juice of the lemon, omitting all sweetening, is also val\u00ac uable in its effect on the intestines, if it is taken half an hour before anything else is eaten mornings and continued for ten days. As a rule only half a lemon should be used each morning, as too much juice will set up acid conditions in the system. To reach the kidneys, take the juice of any pear that is pleas\u00ac ing to the taste. This also should be taken half an hour before the morning meal. Bipe, mellow cherries cleanse the stomach. The juice of grapes builds better blood than any other one thing; and carries natural iron into the system, the iron being organized in the vegetable kingdom. When iron is taken direct from the mineral kingdom, it destroys lung tissue and leads to consump\u00ac tion. This is a wonderful law, and has been proven true in count\u00ac less cases. No food should ever be taken into the human body unless it has been organized in the vegetable kingdom. 'The juice of peaches cleanses the skin, and also brings into the blood a great quantity of iron that has been organized in the vegetable kingdom. Blackberries that are naturally sweet and that may be eaten without sugar, build up the heart tissue and cleanse it to a re\u00ac markable extent. The juice alone is preferred for this purpose. The juice of a pineapple sweetened slightly with honey, which is a pure form of carbon-food, will help keep the throat and lungs in a vigorous condition. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 141 The apple performs a service of such value that it is referred to under another head in this chap\u00ac ter. Nature, by special design, pro\u00ac duces apples in wonderful variety to meet the needs of the human body. If you are taking the juice fruits for food purposes alone, they may be eaten as the first course of the morning meal; but if you seek them strictly as elim\u00ac inators of bad material in the body, they should be all taken a half hour before anything else is eaten in the morning. Two or more fruits may be taken to\u00ac gether, if desired, but the juice alone must be used. APPENDIX. IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF \"APPENDICITIS.\" The above picture shows the intestinal canal from the stomach to the outlet at the extreme end. A little way up at the lower left hand corner of the illustration will be found a small attachment, c c, which is known as the appendix. It leads out from the intestinal canal, near the juncture of the small and the large intestines. As the above picture is supposed to be facing the reader, the appendix is in fact on the right side of the body, not far from the groin; and it is at this place that the common operation is made, by cutting open the abdomen and removing the appendix. Appendicitis is on the rapid increase, and is caused directly by putrid matter getting lodged in the appendix, from which it cannot be removed by the peristalsis of the bowels, as it is out of the way. But primarily the cause of this dreaded malady is the poisonous effect of adulterations in food, of which there are so many today that a book would be required to describe them. The delicate lining of the intestines becomes irritated, then in\u00ac flamed, and the membrane is sloughed off over the appendix, open- 142 PERSONAL BOOK mg the latter to all the foul material in the passage. The result is a tendency to rapid mortification. Third Road to Life.\u2014PERISTALSIS.\u2014This is a wave ac\u00ac tion of the intestinal canal. When it ceases or is sluggish, con\u00ac stipation and danger of piles, kidney disease, liver disease' and APPENDICITIS, may follow. The only safe way is to travel all the Poads to Life, and keep the peristaltic action perfect at all times. There is one gift of Nature that does more to aid in this good result than any other thing. Write down in your mem\u00ac ory the saying: \"An apple eaten before breakfast every morning will keep the doctor away.\" But there are more than a hundred varieties of apples. Nature never made that number carelessly and blindly. I here are about forty kinds of apples that, when mellow, will be found exceedingly pleasing to the taste. But one kind may suit one palate, and another kind suit another palate. Yoiir variety is what you want. If you eat a kind that does not perfectly suit your palate, neuralgia or rheumatism may follow or the stomach may refuse to digest it. When the flesh of the apple touches the tongue, intense pleasure should attend the eat\u00ac ing of it. This floods the stomach with gastric juice and aids the effects sought. Study yourself and the results that follow the habit of eatin\u00b0- a good sized apple every morning a half hour before breakfast5 Be sure the fruit is mellow. Never eat a cooked apple, unless it be one that is baked. Baked sweet apples with milk or cream belong to the food class rather than this service. Fourth Road to Life.\u2014NOH-CLOGGING FOODS._It has- been proved and known as a scientific fact for centuries that a thm person stands five times the chance of living to an extraor\u00ac dinary age in the possession of all the faculties that a fat per\u00ac son possesses. Let the latter be ever so careful in matters of health, he will not live as long as his thin friend. Another scien\u00ac tific fact is that the use of thin foods will aid long life and good ea does not mean that solid foods are never to be eaten; for the laborer and the soldier need staying powers and therefore foods that will remain a long time in the stomach and furnish sustenance. But the ordinary person is injured by staying foods as clogging is sure to result. Even the soldier and the laborer is helped by a mixed diet, some parts of which are liquid, as soup, milk, stews, plenty of water before a meal, and fruits. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 143 The glands of the human tace, which furnish saliva and the means of digesting bread, grains and sugars. Fifth Road to Life.\u2014INGESTION.\u2014This process is the first and most important part of digestion. It occurs at the mouth, and there are glands that are created for the sole purpose of being used to prepare food for the stomach. Part of these glands will be seen in the accompanying picture which gives a view of one side of the face. They send a flow of saliva to the mouth, and absorb in return the same saliva and all the soluble material in the form of nutritive food that has been made ready for its ac\u00ac tion. It has been proved that many kinds of food can be drawn directly into the circulation without going to the stomach, if they have been thoroughly masticated by the tongue and teeth. The whites of fresh eggs have thus been used to give strength and pure blood, without employing the stomach which may be inflamed from indigestion. Slow mastication of any food, by yielding a greater percent\u00ac age of nutrition, will lessen the quantity of poisons that enter the system. Ingestion serves many noble purposes, but among the best is the power it has to keep the body from becoming too thin or too stout. Ingestion consists of a thorough mixture of the food in the mouth before swallowing so that the taste-buds of the tongue will act on all of it, even the smallest particles. 144 PERSONAL BOOK \"TASTE-BUDS.\" \u2014 On the tongue there are wonderful growths that are known as taste-buds, which bring on digestion or else interfere with it. These taste-buds should become thor\u00ac oughly excited in the mouth by a long process of action with the food in order to make digestion perfect. Taste is the direct guide to the stomach; and the taste- buds are connected by the nerves with the stomach itself, so that they represent its health or disorder. If the stomach or its juices are out of tone, the blood is permeated by a change in the alkaline or acid conditions, and these reach the mouth both directly and indirectly. The taste-buds are in the tongue, and are mounted by hairlike projections called papillae. These cover the surface of the tongue. They rise up when you taste. Drop some vinegar on another person's tongue or your own, and you will see the papillae stand erect. When you taste, these buds absorb the liquid, and inform the nerves; the nerves inform the stomach; the stomach telegraphs back its condition; and the food is not acceptable or is relished exactly as the stomach feels. Food that has no liquid is tasteless, until it excites the saliva and dissolves in it; therefore insoluble substances remain tasteless. The back of the tongue is most sensitive to salt and bitter substances, and, as this part is supplied by the ninth pair of nerves in sympathy with the stomach, such flavors, by sympathy, often produce vomiting. The edges of the tongue are most sensitive to sweet and sour substances, and as this part is supplied by the fifth pair of nerves, which also go to the face, an acid, by sympathy, distorts the countenance. When the food is acted upon by the taste-buds of the tongue the glands of the face and throat ingest into it a most power\u00ac ful fluid that gives the food a new character. One-fourth less food will supply all the needs of the body, bring the stomach and intestines into a splendid condition of health, keep the body neither too thin nor too fat, and remove all dangers of disease by making the accumulation of dead animal soil impossible. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 145 Sixth Road to Life.\u2014 OPEN-SKIN.\u2014The pores of the skin are engines that pump both ways. They draw in air and drive out effete matter. They are clogged from two sources. This fact is important. When dead animal soil is abundant in the body it gets to the surface and lies about the millions of mouths of the pores of the skin, causing stoppage and set\u00ac ting up irritation. So dirt from without will also clog the pores. The remedy is a dry rubbing, or fric\u00ac tion bath, for the upper half mg and night in cold weather; and a hot water bath for the legs once every twenty-four hours. In summer a whole-body bath may be taken before breakfast every morning. Seventh Road to Life.\u2014DEEP RESPIRATION.\u2014It may not be known that the average person uses only about ten per cent, of the lungs in breathing, and that the remaining ninety per cent, is unused. Science teaches that used lungs are never the seat of disease, especially of pneumonia or consumption; but that the unused parts invite these maladies. This law is so important that it should be memorized. The ability to open one hundred per cent, of the lungs and to use them all, is the only safety from the most common and the most dreaded of all enemies of life, the white plague. But there is another rule and it is this: The greater the per\u00ac centage of the lung capacity that is used habitually in respiration, the greater is the vitality. Likewise, when the pores of the skin are free and active, in conjunction with the increased power of the lungs, weakness never remains; for energy is drawn in by the respiration of the pores of the skin and the breathing of the lungs. Keep these two departments active and you will not know nervous breakdown or loss of vitality. PERSONAL BOOK \"THE DEEDS THAT MAKE EARTH BETTER\" THIRD DEPARTMENT OF THE PERSONAL BOOK OF THE RALSTON HEALTH CLUB \"Slip iytjljpr Intelltgpnrp\" RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 147 Chapter Seventeen THE NEW CIVILIZATION No age is truly civilized that cannot check the flood of suffering disease and wrongs that overwhelm the world. HIS is the age of the highest civilization known to man. Inventive genius is at white heat. Its products are so amazing that, if a person who went out of life fifty years ago, were to come back to earth now he would be overwhelmed with the vastness of what he looked upon. Great engines, great buildings, great hotels, great boats, intri\u00ac cate and complicated mechanism in every branch of the operations of life, and an endless array of luxurious equipment specially made for luxurious people, confront us at every turn. There is no doubt that invention has made remarkable progress. A stream can rise no higher than its source. All true power serves to aid not crush humanity. Civilization can never be greater in fact than the capacity of man to assimilate it and make it a part of his genuine existence. Life is so complex today that neither the nerves, nor the mind, nor the heart can endure the strain that so much inventive genius has imposed upon them. But if the good works of such genius overload the powers of man, what shall be said of the evil that the same spirit of inventive genius is accomplishing in its vast output of adulterated goods, the thousand tricks in business, in chemical compounding, in alteration of products, in concealment, and in endless misguiding conditions? If the accumulated mass on the one hand, and the insidious energies of subtle poisons on the other, make life a difficult burden to bear, what is to be said of the rush, the hurry, the wear 148 PERSONAL BOOK and tear that are now necessary in order to keep moving with the tide of progress? Of what use is a civilization that breaks down the mind, over\u00ac strains the heart, and rends the nerves with pain and torturing agonies? The question arises, is inventive genius a real civiliza\u00ac tion ? In the old pagan days of luxurious splendor, many arts that are now lost, then prevailed and gave evidence of the power of the human mind for inventive genius; but there was no civilization. We are proud of the progress made in surgery today; but which is better: To be cut into by men of skill, or to so live that no surgery is required ? Which is the wiser civilization ? We are proud of the advance made in medicine, and the world looks writh admiration on the increasing army of doctors that are now so numerous that they require inventive genius to earn a liveli\u00ac hood. There never was a time when there was so much knowledge of diseases, and so many maladies to be treated. The civilization of today says: \"Let well enough alone.\" But the man who owns a horse that may be stolen locks the bam before the horse is lost, and thus prevents the loss. He does not let well enough alone. If he did, he would be spending money to get back the horse. By refusing to let well enough alone, he anticipated the loss and so was put to no loss and to no expense. This is the civilization that is taught by the Ralston Health Club. Which is better: To be con\u00ac stantly hunting for lost health, or to prevent the loss and save suffer\u00ac ing and cost? The Hew Civilization is founded on the best common sense of the human brain, instead of inventive genius. It seeks to set up good health in advance of sickness so that the latter may never come. As far as the present civilization has achieved results to this end, the Hew Civilization will let matters alone; but wherein the former has failed, the latter will succeed. 1. The First Step.\u2014\"DRINKING WATER.\"\u2014Nothing is so important as pure drinking water. It cannot be obtained from water works, nor from rivers, nor from wells, nor from springs. There are but two sources: One is from the clouds, which is natural distillation; and the other is from condensed steam, which is arti\u00ac ficial distillation. Rain is the best of all drinking water, but it is often hard to get in a state that is free from an unpleasant taste. Condensed steam has the same taste; but gives it up when exposed to clean, cool air. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB. 149 All great ocean boats, and all government vessels use condensed steam for drinking water. It enables them to convert the salt sea into pure, clear and absolutely wholesome drinking water. The principle is a simple one: That part of water that rises to the clouds in the form of vapor is only the pure part; all that is bad being left behind. All that rises from boiling water in the form of vapor or steam is likewise pure; the bad portion being left. But the first steam carries with it some of the flavor of the impurities; so that double distillation or triple distillation is better. This is done by taking the condensed steam, re-boiling it, and condensing its steam. In almost every large city in the civilized world, water distilla\u00ac tion is carried on. It also prevails, as has been stated, on the boats that do the great business of the oceans, and on battleships. There will come the time when no other water will be drank. The reason is plain. Fire and some kind of water are obtainable in all parts of the globe. The process of catching the steam is so simple that it does not even require inventive genius to get it. Any plumber can run a pipe from a boiler to a receptacle; the pipe being arranged at the top of the boiler to catch the steam and the latter will be condensed on the way to the receptacle. To aid in its quick con\u00ac densation, the steam should be led through a coil of pipes, and these should be placed in the air or in cool water. But steam does not travel faj- before it condenses. One of the best authorities on the causes of mortality in this and other countries, says: \"There is not the slightest doubt that more than ten million persons in this land have died from the use of impure drinking water; and it is safe to say that ten million more victims will die of the same cause before the world reaches that stage of civilization that will set up public water stills in every city and town. War is called the dark blot on our civilization; but war claims in its years of strife less than a hundred thousand slain men; bad drinking water kills the people by the million. As the public water stills are the only solution of this barbarism, as they are sure to come in time, why not set them up now and save more victims than a hundred big wars will bring?\"\u2014Why not? The public is too busily engaged in the exploits of inventive genius to turn its thoughts to the simple matter of saving millions of human lives. But the Ralston Community will attend to it for Ralstonites. The cost of the water still is very slight, and a fair charge for the 150 PERSONAL BOOK. water by the gallon would more than pay all expenses of running it and of the help employed, leaving a profit in time that could be placed to the credit of the Community fund. This is the First Step in the New Civilization. It requires energy to do anything import\u00ac ant; but the Rulers and the Founder of a Ralston Community will show the world what is meant by energy. Any water can be distilled. But let it be double or triple distilled; then set it aside for two days slightly exposed to a clean, cool air, where the steam flavor will be wholly lost. Then it is the pure water of nature. It can be filtered through sand, if the latter can be made perfectly clean and baked with a high heat to destroy the germs. Do not wait for some one else to take this first step. That spirit of waiting is the fault of the human race in all ages. 2. The Second Step.\u2014\"THE DAIRY.\"\u2014While nearly ninety per cent, of the human body is composed of water, and while water contains two or the parts of the vital food of life, all parts are con\u00ac tained in milk. People ridicule the use of milk as belonging to childhood only; but it is the fluid that is built by all the contents of the stomach taken daily into the system. Digestion whether in man, woman or child, has for its purpose the turning of all food and fluids into milk. In the cow, by a trick that is as old as the race, this fluid is caught on its way into the general circulation. The bag is provided by nature as a depository for the young during its few weeks' of nurture from its mother; but nature will keep on sending the milk to the bag as long as there is a demand for it. Let this cease and the bag will dry up, and the milk will then enter the general circulation again. Every man is a milk-maker in his own body; for milk is the intermediate state of the nutrition be\u00ac tween digestion and blood-production. It is called chyle, and its receptacles are called lacteals; both words that are allied to milk, as the latter is known as the lacteal fluid even in the cow. These facts are stated to explain why, when a patient is con\u00ac valescing and cannot absorb anything else, he is given an exclusive milk diet. The very thing he cares little for when well, he craves when hungry and ill. If nature ever gave any blessings to the race, she gave the cow for the direct benefit and saving of humanity; for, without milk, there would be the end of all mankind before the next generation. In fact, it is difficult to carry nutrition into the system without the aid of milk sooner or later. A person may go a RALSTON HEALTH CLUB. 151 long time without it in some form, but sickness and morbid condi\u00ac tions will ensue. All doctors agree to this fact. When asked what is the one single best food in all the earth, they answer immediately, milk. It is necessary in infancy, it should enter largely into child\u00ac hood, it cannot be omitted in sickness in adults and it does more to maintain health than all other kinds of food combined. Every man and woman needs a little each day. These are admitted facts. Being true, they point the way to a Step in the New Civiliza\u00ac tion. Milk as now produced under the auspices of present day civiliza\u00ac tion, is not clean, nor is it pure. The New Civilization intends to see that it is pure. Every Ralston Community will establish, through honest farmers, a dairy business that will be right when started, and will be kept right all the time by inspection. Pure milk raw is better than impure milk sterilized; many times better. Let the Founder and the Four Rulers of your Ralston Com\u00ac munity establish such a dairy as has been suggested. It cannot lose money. The milk will be brought directly from the dairy to the homes of the Ralstonites, and the profit of the middleman will be avoided. Energy is required to accomplish anything worth while in the world; but you possess that energy. Never let up in your efforts. Discouragement is the steel that tries the soul. 3. The Third Step.\u2014\"POULTRY.\"\u2014The gifts of nature that are most necessary to humanity are pure water, pure milk, and clean eggs. While these are not enough, they constitute the foundation of a wonderful Temple. That eggs are regarded as necessary may be seen from the fact that millions are stored away every week in cold places where they are held for the winter rise. This cold stor\u00ac age plan effects three results that are injurious: The price is forced up during the months when eggs are most plentiful and most needed. The winter prices are held up by the power of the manipulators to control the output. The eggs themselves are deprived of their nutritive value to such an extent that they are nearly worthless as food. It is unnecessary here to discuss the usefulness of eggs and of poultry. The young cockerels make high-priced broilers, selling at fabulous prices; and the old stock have a market value greater than ever before; so that if a Community were to keep poultry solely for 152 PERSONAL BOOK. the eggs, the stock would bring profits. Below, as the result of many experiments made by us or to our knowledge, are some gen\u00ac eral facts that should be used by the Community in establishing a poultry plant: 1. Pullets hatched in February, March and April, and even as late as May in many localities, will lay eggs in the fall and through the winter, when prices are exorbitant. 2. Pullets hatched in September of one year will lay during the next spring, summer, fall and winter. 3. Hens that are not forced to lay their full number of eggs after May, and are allowed some rest for several months, will lay eggs in the fall and winter. This matter has been managed suc\u00ac cessfully for the purpose of securing winter eggs when prices are high. 4. A record should be kept of the egg production so that hens may be secured that will lay in twelve months not less than 140 eggs each. By selection, discarding lazy and non-profitable hens, this result is being brought about wherever it is intelligently tried. 5. The idea that hens need a large run on the ground is not held today. There are pens containing one thousand hens each, all crowded together, and elevated several feet, where every hen is healthy and a large egg-producer. Chicks need ground to run on, but not very much. Then they begin to lay, they can be better cared for if given a raised house, with plenty of sunlight, and air without drafts, than if they run out and pick up filthy matter. The cleanliness of the food and water is of the highest importance. The result of such methods will be the supply of all members of a Ralston Community with fresh eggs known to be cleanly fed. Old hens cost more for feeding and they moult longer in the year. A healthy pullet ought to lay eggs for eighteen months without moulting very much; and after she has laid eggs for that length of time, she becomes too old to be profitable for egg-laying, and is still young enough to make good flesh for the meat market. Let every Ralston Community, by its Four Rulers and Founder, select some locality where a poultry establishment may be set up. Many farmers who are honest will gladly take part in the manage\u00ac ment, and thus save the expense of a salaried man. There are in this land today millions and possibly billions of eggs that are to be used by humanity. But these eggs were not fed with clean food, nor are they as wholesome and nutritious as they RALSTON HEALTH CLUB. 153 would have been if they had been properly produced and kept. They are necessaries and the people will have them, good or bad. For this reason it is the part of the New Civilization to set up poultry establishments and secure for themselves fresh eggs at living prices. The difference in the health of the members will pay the largest known dividends. Who has the energy to move in this matter? Let your Four Rulers attend to it. 4. The Fourth Step.\u2014\"WHEAT FLOUR.\"\u2014When man came upon the earth he found wheat waiting for him. It is one of the few products that contain all the parts of the human body. Milk and eggs are closest to the body and contain in more direct form all its parts, and are free from the old age and ripening material of the grains and meats. But wheat stands next to milk and eggs in real value, and its mineral-old-age material can be thrown from the human system by the use of distilled water described in the First Step of the New Civilization. Wheat is grown in a husk called bran, which is wholly in\u00ac digestible. This husk is ground into graham flour and in break\u00ac fast foods. Such articles should be avoided. They are not food in fact. Mills that produce white flour extract the starch only from the wheat, leaving several layers of the highest nutritive value as well as the husks to be disposed of in some other way. The white starch is not the real value that was created for man. It is a weak, sickly and puny part of the grain. It may be adulterated by the addition of different minerals. We have seen a barrel of finely ground white earth, so light and fluffy that it afforded a most attractive appear\u00ac ance. There are clay eaters in some parts of the country; but when people pay a high price for flour they have a right to expect flour from wheat and not from milled earth. The bleaching process, the addition of poisonous alum, and other foreign ingredients, and skil\u00ac ful alterations of flour under the control of inventive genius, will furnish the history of the next few years. It makes no difference to the millers who is made sick or who dies; if only they can add to their dividends. Food adulterators do not believe in any future punishment, and so they are willing to commit murder in the name of commercial profits. Laws cannot reach them. Great corpora\u00ac tions and little politicians control the situation. They rule not only the government but the human race as well. 154 PERSONAL BOOK. Thus we see the dizzy height of present day civilization making graves for men, women and children through the climacteric vie tories of inventive genius. Deception is the goal of human achievement. The New Civilization turns in the other direction. It learns that wheat is the one food created for man. From wheat is made the staff of life, as old as the race. But is was only in recent times that the starch was taken for bread, and the better part discarded for other uses. The United States Government has discovered in France what is known as the Schweitzer process of grinding wheat, which is not in any way imitated in this country. In a Bulletin issued by our government, this process is described and the remarkable nutritive value of the bread made from it is also noted. Such bread has all the strength-giving powers of the best beef, and furnishes a better line of food than any meat. Laborers and business men feed almost exclusively on such bread. There are millers in this country that pretend or claim to make similar flour; but there is no truth in the assertion. The difference between the so-called whole wheat bread of America and the half wheat bread of France, is very distinct; although both are vastly superior to the starch-wheat bread now used by every one in America. The French bread has the following advantages over any and all kinds of bread made in this country: 1. It is made from wheat freshly ground the day it is used. 2. It uses half the outer layers, and avoids those that are harsh and indigestible. 3. It affords a bread the flavor of which surpasses any food that can be lifted to the lips of man. 4. It gives strength greater than meat or any other food. 5. It cannot be adulterated, bleached, blended, or altered. It is pure from the hand of nature, and there is no other way of get\u00ac ting it. 6. Each family has a mill of small size that grinds the wheat, or else a number of families band together for the purpose and secure a larger mill. This custom prevails universally in France. 7. No corporation can lay the weight of its leaden hand on the purse or the health of the consumer. 8. The wheat can be purchased from the farmer, or can be raised by a Ealston Community. It can be stored ahead in such quantities as may be desired, and used daily. To get the rich, RALSTON HEALTH CLUB. 155 palate-attracting flavor of the bread, the wheat must be ground the day it is used. 9. The cost of the bread is less than one-third the cost of white starch wheat bread now in use; and the strength-giving power is fully ten times as much. But figuring on the commercial side only, a family can cut its expenses down to about one-third in this department. As bread is the stafi of life, and as the French process makes it more attractive than any other food, it can be safely as\u00ac serted that if this process is once adopted by a Ralston Community, the cost of living will be reduced to a remarkable extent. More than this, the health of the body will be enhanced to a high degree. It seems revolutionary. But French civilization is far ahead of American civilization in this one respect, although far below it in barbaric riches of cookery in other departments. French pastry fells more men than war. We do not know of any French wheat mills having been intro\u00ac duced in America. No one has yet taken the trouble to do so. People are so busy with the present day civilization that they do not have time to look up and see the sky or the signs of the times. Death catches them still busy and absorbed. But the New Civilization, as borne forward by Ralston Com\u00ac munities, will take the necessary step to procure a mill large enough for its families. Do not let this matter drop from your mind. Show yourself worthy of something better by actually doing something better. It seems as if the present day civilization had hypnotized men and women; as they give little heed to the causes of ill health, but go on doctoring the results of ill health until death clips them. One death in a family is not enough to wake the parents from their lethargy. In a city where the people had warning that the drink\u00ac ing water was polluted by typhoid germs, it took seven years of fatalities and many thousands of deaths to wake the people up. Beautiful children sleep now in young graves, and afflicted parents mourn their loss and take flowers to the cemeteries; but the same parents will not lift a finger to save the lives of other children in the same family. As a doctor says: \"The living do not care, and the dead cannot care; so what is the use?\" And we stand at the apex of present day civilization. The New Civilization looks to the cause, and builds a sound body with a sound mind. 156 PERSONAL BOOK There are many groups of people in France today who eat the delicious bread of their process, and privately owned mills are every\u00ac where in use. The time will come when such mills, or others like them, will be made in America, or be imported here from France, and the cost of living will be reduced two-thirds in this one line alone. Then will the problems of health and of food be solved. To Americans this is a great step. To the progressive French, it has already been taken, and is an old story. Now let your Ralston Community through its Founder and Four Rulers, set up a Community Mill, and bring these dual bless\u00ac ings as soon as possible. 5. The Fifth Step.\u2014\"DUST.\"\u2014There is no doubt that eighty per cent, of all the dreaded maladies arise from dust. This danger is described in many recent official publications. Under the micro\u00ac scope a. piece of dust so small that it cannot be seen except in the sunlight of a window, looms up like a vast world, filled with every variety of landscape. In its nooks and cavities, and sitting proudly on its ridges and promontories, are the germs of tuberculosis, of small pox, of measles, of mumps, of scarlet fever, of meningitis, of pneumonia, of grippe, of catarrh, of diphtheria, and many contagions. These germs ride with the dust and stop with it. It may affect the eyes, the nose, the face, the neck, the lips, the throat, the bronchial passages, the lungs, the hands, or other exposed parts of the body; and, being taken into the circulation, it soon has control of the whole system. But fresh outdoor air, and clear sunlight are more than they can endure. Here are nature's antiseptics. Fresh air in a room has value, but no antiseptic powers. Some remarkable cures have been effected by consumptives who, after trying everything else, have moved to the South where they could live day and night under the sky. But it is only in the parts of the South that are rainless the year round, or nearly so. Some States have excellent climates, but consumptives who go there have not lived day and night under the clear sky, and have not always recovered. Some get well, but many do not. Yet in States where there is almost no rain in a year, and the patients remain wholly in the open, the cures have been many, even when started late. In cities and in the country throughout the United States, the dust has reigned supreme until of late. Now oiled roads are being built, and houses are using rugs instead of carpets. Brooms and RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 157 brushes, as well as dust rags, are being abandoned. Curtain and drapery collect dust in heavy masses and let it go when agitated. Colds, grippe, catarrh, and pneumonia follow. Many cases can be traced to the use of curtains and drapery. Schools, public buildings, halls, theatres and churches are being oiled out instead of swept out. The old way was to sweep all the dust of a church into the air, then let it settle down on the seats where the in-coming people would be sure to get it all in their nostrils and thoats. Even where the sexton dusts the seats after the sweeping, the dust merely dances up into the air, and then comes down again. Where did he think it was going when he chased it olf the seats with his feather duster ? In schools where the old methods of sweeping and dusting prevailed, sore throats and other troubles were common; but in some of those same schools where the oiling system is in use, such maladies ceased unless they found a similar source at home. It is a well-proved fact that no disease arises out of doors. All contagions begin in the house, or else in bodies weakened by house atmosphere. The members of a Ralston Community should pledge them\u00ac selves to reduce as much as possible all indoor dust, and all nearby out door dust. While disease does not arise in outdoor life, this means when such life escapes the blowing dust of the roads; and, while pure fresh air and clear sunlight are nature's antiseptics, they do not act on masses of filthy dust that rise in clouds from a manured highway, although they will in time defeat all dangers if given ample opportunity. Sunlight and fresh air act slowly; the air must be fresh and pure; and the sunshine clear and strong. In cities there is no pure air, and the sunlight is cut off by trees and buildings from doing its best work. A Ralston Community can do much to keep outdoor dust from entering the houses. The roads may be watered or oiled. Then much can be done to keep the indoor dust from being inhaled, or filling the air, or falling on the dining table, or on plates or food. This is accomplished by decreasing the carpets to rugs, oiling the margins of the floors, getting the free dust out at windows long before the rooms are used again, and lessening the draperies and curtains. The vacuum process of cleaning is a blessing. These cleaners are now sold at a very low price and will be still lower One will serve all the families of a Ralston Community. The 158 PERSONAL BOOK users can contribute a few cents per hour for the time it is re\u00ac tained, and this will add to the Community Fund. With the disappearance of dust, more than eighty per cent, of all maladies will go away; and some of the most dangerous of the fatal maladies will be kept out of reach. Lift the shade at a window where the sun is shining, and see if there are flecks of dust in the air. This tells the story. Something is yet defective. Make the fight. It is worth while. Educate the people. It is the dawn of the New Civilization. 6. The Sixth Step.\u2014\"INSECTS.\"\u2014It has been proved that malaria, chills and fever, and other diseases, are carried by the bite of the mosquito into the human system. It has also been proved that typhoid and many other contagions are conveyed by the house- % Never let a mosquito in the house. Keep all flies out; admit not one. This can be done for it is being done today. Screens are very important. Next in value is watchfulness, for the individual who belongs to present day civilization will stand at the open screen door and talk while droves of insects enter past him. He has the same degree of intelligence as the young man who rocks the boat when a party is out rowing. As screens are imperfectly used at times, it is well to remember that mosquitoes breed in stagnant water standing in pails, cans, pools and ponds. The liberal use of crude petroleum on the surface once a week, will kill the eggs. It is cheaper than the doctor's bill. Flies are being kept away from houses in numerous instances by not allowing manure to remain in the air near by. Flies lay their eggs in anything that is filthy, notably manure. Each Ealston Community should see that there is no filth left on the surface of the ground within five hundred feet of any mem\u00ac ber's home. In cities there are stringent laws covering this matter; but they are not always enforced. Attend to that. Privies should be tightly sealed from the air. Garbage should not be left uncover\u00ac ed. Compost put on the land should be worked at once into it. Nothing has been more clearly proved than that outdoor cleanliness will keep files away from the whole locality. \"I have not seen a fly in this house, nor near it. But I think there are thousands of flies around the screens of the next house,\" said a man who was visiting in the country. The next house was a thousand feet away. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 159 It had manure from dogs, cats, horses, and other life lying all around; while the first house was surrounded by perfectly clean grounds. It costs almost nothing to be exempt from disease. The price is the willingness to wake up and take notice of the coming dawn of the New Civilization. 7. The Seventh Step.\u2014\"RALSTON STORES.\"\u2014It is a part of a better civilization that useless profits should be brought to an end. In the matter of milk, the farmer receives the lowest possible price, and the consumer pays the highest. In the matter of eggs, the poultryman is not paid what he should get for them; the buyer takes his profit, the cold storage company makes its share, and the retailer charges the consumer the final profit. If the poultryman were to sell eggs direct to the consumer, he would receive more money and the consumer would pay less. Three middlemen would be got rid of. A Ralston Store is a place where goods are on sale that are bought at first price, with but one profit; and no profit in fact after they leave the producer or wholesaler. There is no middleman and no retailer to take part of the price. Such things as milk, cream, butter, eggs, fruits and vegetables, can be secured from the farmers, if there is no Ralston Farm conducted under the management of the Ralston Community. Other goods, even clothing as well as groceries and provisions, can be obtained from the manufacturers in most cases. The saving in the cost of living will be so great that it will amaze those who join the Community and try it. If some honest grocer could be induced to set aside a part of his store for a Ralston Community, he would find his general business increasing all the time. Some years ago this was tried in several places, and the grocers found it to their advantage to come into the Club. There business greatly grew, and their prosperity was never so great as then. At first thought it looks as if a Ralston Community would hurt the business of a store-keeper; but the facts of actual experi\u00ac ence show differently. Grocers and others were not in favor of the movement until they tried it. In any event, there should be Ralston Stores to protect the people from adulterated goods and from excessive profits. It all depends on the interest and determination of the men and women who organize the Ralston Community. Here is the first genuine opportunity to reduce the cost of living. 160 PERSONAL BOOK A Ralston Store would be known as a reliable place for the entire public to trade in. The goods could be sold to Ralstonites at cost; and to others at a fair profit; and the benefit of the gain could be carried to the cash fund of the Ralston Community. In conducting a Ralston Store:\u2014 Avoid impure or low grade goods. Do not be tempted by cheap prices. Let the store win the name of being reliable, so that all persons may know they are getting unadulterated goods that are fresh and honest in quality and value. Avoid goods that bear the name \"pure,\" \"hygienic,\" or some similar title. The adulterator makes a loud claim for purity, or for hygienic qualities. Pure food displays are dyspepsia breeding concoctions. Domestic science as taught today is the science of making wicked food combinations appear attractive; and its pupils are little girls whose minds are too young to know better; thus being molded in error while yet plastic. Avoid goods bearing our name. If the source of a stream is polluted with the foulest of offal, you do not want any part of the outcome. So if the use of a valued name is stolen, the goods to which it is wrongfully attached must ever be tainted with dishon\u00ac esty. The adulterator is a murderer; he slays hundreds of people. You do not want him to make your foods or other goods. Turn to the rising sun. Seek a new civilization by founding or entering a Ralston Com\u00ac munity and displaying your ability, your will power, and your energy of execution. Live men and women are wanted today by this new civilization. Do not wait for some one else to start the good work. Have your share at once in \"The deeds that make earth tetter RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 161 Chapter Eighteen RALSTON COMMUNITIES In union there is strength: but In the Idle fragments of the best constructed car a noble power is sacrificed. RGANIZATION is necessary in every line of success. The Ralston Health Club has tried for a third of a century to execute its doctrines and carry on its wor& by its book alone; but we now find that it can accom\u00ac plish the great results for which it exists, only by set\u00ac ting up local organizations. These are to be known as Ralston Com\u00ac munities. The true definition of a Ralston Community is this: An agreement existing between forty or more persons who are members of the Ralston Health Club, who hold Membership Cards under the plan of the Personal Book. The method whereby cards are issued is stated in the final page of this book. The Rules of Organization are as follows: \"HOW ORGANIZED.\" RULE ONE.\u2014A Ralston Community may be organized in any city, town, borough, village, or country locality where forty or more Card Members may be found. A Card Member is a person who holds a Membership Card under the Personal Book. Two or more Ralston Communities may be organized in the same place, if there are enough Card Members; or one Community may contain as many members as such Community desires to admit beyond the number of forty; but the same person cannot join two Communities. 162 PERSONAL BOOK \"MO AGE LIMIT.\" RULE TWO.\u2014There is no limit to the age of a member. In many families the father and mother become members, and then bring their children into the Club. There are thousands of young boys and girls who are Ralstonites at the present day. No better inheritance can be left to children than perfect bodies. \"ALL MAY VOTE.\" RULE THREE.\u2014Every member of a Ralston Community is entitled to vote, no matter how many Honors such member has won, or what the age may be. A young child would have the same vote as the father or mother. This is the only organization where every person in the family has equal right to attend, and all are entitled to vote. It is the only organization where the whole family are ad\u00ac mitted; thus preventing separation evenings or day times when meetings are held. \"SECURING THE CHARTER.\" RULE FOUR.\u2014A Charter is issued by the Ralston Health Club of America to the Ralston Community when application is sent in according to the following form: \"To Ralston Health Club, Ralston Heights, Hopewell, Mercer County, New Jersey:\u2014We, the undersigned, being forty or more Card Members, agree to organize a Ralston Community; and we promise to abide at all times by the Rules set forth in the Personal Book governing such organiza\u00ac tion. Our names are stated below, and our full addresses are ap\u00ac pended, together with our Club numbers as written on our Member\u00ac ship Cards. We therefore ask that a Charter be issued to us and full title and authority given to our Community of Ralstonites.\" The foregoing application must be copied in ink, and all signa\u00ac tures must be in ink, with names and addresses clearly set forth. \"NAME OF THE COMMUNITY.\" RULE FIVE.\u2014A Community receives such name as the char\u00ac ter members desire except that the first three words of the name must be made uniform in all organizations as follows: The first word must be either First, Second, Third, etc., and the next two words must be Ralston Community. Thus the first Community to be organized in Washington would be named, \"The First Ralston Community of Washington, D. C.\" The next would be named, RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 163 \"The Second Ralston Community of Washington, D. C.\" But the locality need not be a part of the name if the charter members prefer some other title. NEW MEMBERS AND STRANGERS.\" RULE SIX.\u2014Not less than forty Card Members must make application for a charter. After the organization has been effected, which may be done as soon as the Charter arrives, new members may be admitted by the unanimous vote of a Committee of Four. The members of the Committee are called Rulers. Every stranger to the locality who holds a Membership Card in the Ralston Health Club is entitled to attend all public meetings of any and every Ralston Community; but no private meeting or celebrations without the unanimous consent of the Four Rulers. \"THE OFFICERS.\" RULE SEVEN.\u2014The following are the officers of each Rals\u00ac ton Community: The Founder; the President; the Secretary; the Treasurer; the Four Rulers. The Founder is so named in the ap\u00ac plication and must be the first signer of same. He holds office for life. The first President is named by the Founder and twenty or more others of the charter members. The Secretary, Treasurer and the Four Rulers are all appointed by the President. The same per\u00ac son cannot hold two offices except that the Founder may become President or a Ruler. \"DUTIES OF THE OFFICERS.\" RULE EIGHT.\u2014The duty of the Founder is to keep the Com- munity keenly interested at all times in its great opportunities for the betterment of the human race. The duty of the President is to preside at all meetings of the Community, and at all meetings of the Four Eulers. The duty of the Secretary is to keep a correct record of all transactions of the Community, and of all other mat\u00ac ters that the President may wish to have recorded. The duty of the Treasurer is to handle all moneys of the Community, to receive and to pay out such funds as the Community may order, and to audit all bills and accounts. \"DUTIES OF THE FOUR RULERS \" RULE NINE._The duties of the Four Rulers are many, and may be briefly stated as follows: They are to make and cause the 164 PERSONAL BOOK execution of all laws and rules of the Community so that they do not in any way conflict with the Rules herein set forth. The Rulers are to pass upon all questions of meetings, entertainments, celebra\u00ac tions, and measures for the improvement of the Community and the betterment of the public health. They shall determine what fees, if any, are to be paid by members of the Community for the maintenance of the same; but no officer or other person connected with the Community shall receive a salary or shall be paid for services rendered the Community; but outside parties, when prop\u00ac erly employed, may be compensated under special contract only, and goods purchased are to be paid for likewise, provided no member shall sell anything to the Community. \"ACQUIRING PROPERTY.\" RULE TEN.\u2014The Community may acquire and hold property which shall be purchased only on the written consent of three- fourths of all the living members of such Community; and the title to the same shall be in the charter name of the Community. A valid power of attorney may be executed by the written signatures of three-fourths of all the living members of the Community; such power of attorney being given to the Four Rulers, whose action under the same shall at all times be unanimous in order to be legal. The Four Rulers, acting under said power of attorney, or in the absence thereof, three-fourths of all the living members of the Com\u00ac munity, may buy or sell any property in the name of the Com\u00ac munity, provided no member thereof shall have any interest direct or indirect in the property so bought or sold. \"LIFE SUPPORT FOR THE FOUNDER \" RULE ELEVEN.\u2014If the Founder shall for not less than ten years have performed his duty of keeping the Community at all times keenly interested in the betterment of the human race, and shall have maintained constant enthusiasm in the many grand op\u00ac portunities for doing good both publicly and privately, in saving life, lessening suffering, driving out disease, securing pure foods, decreasing the cost of the necessaries of living, and safeguarding the health of all members; then, after the end of ten years so spent in such forms of higher usefulness, the Founder shall, if his circum\u00ac stances require it, become the special honored charge of the Com\u00ac munity, shall be provided with a home for life and all the com- RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 165 forts and attention that a man who has been a blessing to the world should receive. It will be found that ten years of savings in the cost of living alone for each and every member of the Com\u00ac munity will in that time amount to a vast fortune; and, as each Community should grow to a very large membership, a few cents a week from each member would be more than sufficient for con\u00ac tributing full honors to the Founder. The reason is this: Life on earth is wasted in almost every instance; and when people come to die, even if they have become successfully rich, they realize how empty it has all been and how little they have done for the world. On the other hand the Founder who does his duty well is greater than a king, and his happiness must be the greatest of all persons, for he does the most good. A woman may organize a Community and become a Founder. \"THE FOUR SECTIONS.\" RULE TWELVE.\u2014The Four Rulers govern four sections of the Community; each section being one-fourth, by actual count, of all the members, or as near as may be. The President, after ap\u00ac pointing the Secretary and the Treasurer, shall divide all the mem\u00ac bers into the four sections, consulting with them, and seeking to satisfy all. The four sections should be equally balanced in their interest in the success of the Community. After they are so divided the President shall meet each section separately and select a Ruler who shall be agreed upon by the section; but, if this cannot be done by a majority vote of the section, the President shall make his own choice of Ruler. \"LENGTH OF SERVICE, AND ELECTIONS.\" RULE THIRTEEN.\u2014The Founder shall hold office for life. The President shall hold office for a year, or until his successor is elected. The Secretary and Treasurer shall hold office during the term of the President; and a newly elected President shall appoint such persons to be Secretary and Treasurer as he desires. The Four Rulers shall hold office for two years; but any Ruler shall be re\u00ac moved from office when a majority of his section so request and the other three Rulers consent thereto; or when three-fourths of all members of the section so request in writing. Thereupon the Presi\u00ac dent shall appoint another Ruler for that section. When any Ruler 166 PERSONAL BOOK has held office for two years, he may be re-appointed by thp Presi\u00ac dent, or the latter may appoint another Ruler for that Section. When the President has held office for a year, the Four Rulers shall hold an election, and the choice of any three Rulers shall determine who shall be President for another year. The same President may be re-elected; but no Ruler shall be a candidate for the office of President or hold the same within one year of the time he has held the office of Ruler. \"PREVENTION OF FRAUDS\" RULE FOURTEEN.\u2014It shall he the duty of every officer and every member of a Community to see that no disadvantage is taken of the organization. Private or secret agents of concerns who have goods to sell will make an effort to enter as members, or will seek the names and addresses of members so as to constantly urge them to buy their goods. Likewise those concerns that attempt to reap fortunes by wrongfully giving our name to their products, and thus taking advantage of our many years of work in behalf of honest goods, using our success to bring about their own, will seek by subterfuge and cunning to win a hold on every Ralston Community. As they are traitors to the cause and belong to the greed class which we are fighting, their goods should not be used or countenanced by any loyal Ralstonite. It seems hard to be compelled to make war on our own name; but, since the first dishonest man came on earth, there have been people, who instead of depending on their own ability, have become parasites on every one who wins success; and the Ralston Health Club has had over two hundred such parasites who named their products after it, in whole or in part; but enough to deceive the public. We have no goods to sell, and we do not endorse any. It is therefore made the imperative duty of every Ralstonite, in and out of a Community, to avoid using or counten\u00ac ancing the use of goods or products that bear our name. A breach of this rule is the most serious offence against Ralstonism; for there can be no harm so great as that which clothes itself in a false as\u00ac sumption of honesty. Dishonest food-makers, knowing that the Ralston Club is fighting adulterated goods, believe that if they can use the name of that Club they can win the confidence of the pub\u00ac lic. The same is true of the manufacture of shoddy clothing and other things. From other sources, such as the. manufacturers of patent medicines, and all selfish interests that are a part of the greed classes, will come influences that are disguised. Their agents RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 167 may seek membership, and seem fully accredited, all the while in\u00ac tending to bring discord into the Community. The Founder is especially commissioned to avert any form of discouragement. He must be magnetic and arouse enthusiasm. \"OUTINGS AND CELEBRATIONS.\" RULE FIFTEEN.\u2014The Four Rulers shall establish public meetings, private meetings, socials, special events, celebrations, \"Ralston Days,\" and outings for the entire Community, or for their sections, whenever in their judgment it is wise to do so. They shall also bring about the New Civilization which is fully described in another part of this Personal Book. \"THE SAVINGS FUND.\" RULE SIXTEEN.\u2014Every member of a Community shall pay into the treasury of such Community ten per cent, of all money such member shall save each month by the aid of the Community. Thus if a member whose living bills have been fifty dollars a month, saves half of that amount, or twenty-five dollars, he shall pay in ten per cent, of the latter sum. A larger percentage shall be paid if every member of the Community agrees in writing to do so. The money so paid in shall be invested in a manner that is safe, and shall be spent when so ordered in accordance with Rule Ten. It should be the ambition of every Community some day to own property, erect buildings, establish homes, and prove to the public their influence and power for success. \"RALSTON STORES\" RULE SEVENTEEN.\u2014The Four Rulers shall establish a Ralston Store where every member may purchase goods at cost price; and where the general public may buy goods at a fair profit. All net gains-of a Ralston Store shall be paid over to the Treasurer of the Ralston Community, and shall be subject to control under the provisions of Rule Ten, and Rule Sixteen, as far as such Rules apply. \"RALSTON DAY.\" RULE EIGHTEEN.\u2014The Four Rulers shall make plans in advance for the observance of \"Ralston Day which occurs on the fourth day of every month. The methods that are most pleasing are as follows: 168 PERSONAL BOOK If the weather permits, some outdoor excursion or ramble should be provided. Flowers, fresh air, and exercises in the woods or in touch with nature, should be sought. Some time there should be a Ralston Grove near by; and a Ralston Garden at hand; as well as a Ralston Playground, or Common, which will furnish more pleasure and health than the expenditure of ten times the cost in other ways. It all depends on the executive ability of the mem\u00ac bers of your Community. You will find that it will pay to arouse public interest by actually saturating your locality with Ralston- ism. Take pride in it. The home and school exercises should be made pleasing on every fourth day of the month. Flowers, fruits and wholesome repasts may be made to blend with song and music, with physical games and inspiring talks on the blessings that earth affords to all who seek her gifts. \"RALSTON CALL.\" RULE NINETEEN.\u2014A week or so in advance of every Rals\u00ac ton Day, which is the fourth of the month, the Four Rulers shall cause to be printed in the local papers, and to be read in the churches and schools, the following notice of the coming day, which is known as the RALSTON CALL. On the fourth day of the coming month Ralston Day will be observed. This should be devoted to the practice of health, and to the enjoyment of life's blessings by association with nature. Flowers, fresh air, pure foods, pure water, and health producing games and pleasures should be sought, in the hope that the mind, heart and body will be greatly benefited thereby. The deeds that make earth better are imperishable flowers in the garden of human character. They are beautiful to look upon, and their fragrance reaches to the courts of heaven. They exhale a glory here and breathe a welcome there. They raise some part of life to paradise, they bring some part of heaven to earth, and in this union they proclaim their parent\u00ac age. The foregoing Ralston Call should be printed on small slips of paper and forwarded to the newspapers, and to all others who are asked to announce them. Let this be done every month. It will RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 169 increase the interest of the public in your Community; and, when you secure a majority of the men and women there, you will be the one power that will sway it in all things. There is no limit to the possibilities of success. Do not be annoyed by lukewarm people, nor by those who oppose every movement for the betterment of the world. It has generally happened that one man or one woman has had to stand the brunt of the whole battle when a great era was being ushered in. Be that person, if you must; but, above all things, never be discouraged by enemies or by adverse criticism. Failures are the stepping stones to success when the heart never knows discouragment. \"BEQUESTS AND GIFTS.\" RULE TWENTY.\u2014Many wealthy men and women are mem\u00ac bers of the Ralston Health Club, and some of them have proffered gifts or asked the privilege of making bequests in favor of the Club. To one and all we make the following statement: No be\u00ac quests, gifts or other advantages will be received by the Club, and any such contributions will be turned back to the donors or their estates. But wealthy members whose lives have been saved by the Club, or whose health has been vastly improved, and who are de\u00ac sirous of rewarding their benefactors, should seek out the persons who invited them to join the Club, and should bestow all favors on them; or may, in case of a desire to benefit the general public, give aid and property to one or more Ralston Communities. The Ralston Health Club does not wish to centralize in itself either money or power, but is making plans to place its full government in the hands of all the Ralston Communities, so that it may be free to promulgate its teachings unhampered by great wealth or great obligations. 170 PERSONAL BOOK Chapter Nineteen ARE DOCTORS HONEST? N almost every mail we receive inquiries asking us if we have reason to believe that the present day distrust of physicians is well founded. \"Are doctors honest ?\" everybody wants to know. There are two sides to the question. The general disposition to attack a person or a profession is one that ought not to be encouraged unless it is done under the law that self-perservation is the first demand of nature. If doc\u00ac tors, or a great number of them, are not to be trusted, then human life is in danger, for there is no class of people that can do so much injury to mind and body as the doctor. The entire public, m fact, is at his mercy or in his power. He can diagnose any intestinal pain into appendicitis, rush his patient to the favored hospital, drug the victim into unconsciousness in a few seconds, divide the large fee with the surgeon, and becpme that much richer. Random abuse has no weight with unprejudiced people. Calm facts are wanted. Let us get at the truth in the proper way. In the first place there is always a test of the honesty of doc\u00ac tors, and it is this: If the patient, exercising a reasonable degree of care in his habits, does not become permanently cured by his physician, then the latter is either dishonest or unqualified. This is proved by the fact that every normal human being who pur\u00ac sues natural habits, once well, stays well. Medicines beget more maladies than they cure. The person who is compelled to keep doctoring is being deceived by some one, as it is unnatural to re\u00ac main weak and sickly. The rapid increase of doctors, surgeons, drug stores, hospitals and medicines, shows that the race is fast going to pieces, and that some one is guilty of the greatest crime known.in history; for sickness is keeping pace with this awful increase. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 171 In preparing the present edition of this Personal Book our attention has been called to an article that appeared in Current Literature for January, 1911, entitled \"America's Medical Hell.\" The article which seems to he editorial in its nature, begins: \"Upon the heels of that terrible indictment of the medical schools of the United States which has so stimulated general interest in the work of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, comes an even more harrowing revelation from one himself a physician. * * * it revives all the horrors of the torture cham\u00ac bers of the Middle Ages. To make matters worse the profession has formulated for itself a code of ethics quite inconsistent with any sense either of social responsibility or of moral responsibility. \"Frenzied finance, of which we have heard so much, seems to Doctor Barnesby a display of childish innocence in compari\u00ac son with the horrors of frenzied surgery. The lacerations and dissection of 'human beings in this country by medical men whose fondness for the sight of blood grows to mania with them would have to be witnessed at first hand in order to be quite believed. ISTo such carnival of butchery has ever been witnessed in any land or in any age since the downfall of the sanguinary empire of the Moguls. The operating tables of the United States drip with the blood of helpless sacrifices to the blind worship of the terrible god of medical science. The devotees of this religion are safe, partly because they are licensed to glut their savage instincts by their diplomas, but for the most part because the physicians who know the worst are forced by the superstitions of the time to look on and shudder without betraying the criminals. Hence the rise and spread of the successful conspiracy against American health and life.\" The early history of America contains accounts of the savage rites of human butchery, one of the most common of which was that of sacrificing the patient alive. A beautiful maiden was se\u00ac lected and placed naked on a raised platform where her plight could be seen by tens of thousands of people. The operator would then skillfully cut her heart out while her tied body quivered with the agony of the torture as the organ, dripping with her life blood, was held aloft for all to see. So deftly was the operation performed that she would gaze on her own heart ere consciousness left her. The thirst for the sight of blood increased with the preva\u00ac lence of this custom, as it does today with the medical profession. 172 PERSONAL BOOK In the article referred to there are quotations and extracts from the work of the doctor, some of which may be repeated here: \"For example. Doctor A., finding that Doctor B. has lost a patient through carelessness or stupidity, may forfeit his career if he so much as hints at the truth to the victim's family. * * * \"Doctor So-and-So, we will say, has made a mistaken diag\u00ac nosis and given wrong treatment till the precarious condition of his patient arouses him to a realization of his mistake. If he is wise he will immediately consult with another physician. It is al\u00ac most an absolute certainty that the latter will agree with all he has done, since he has everything to lose and nothing to gain under the circumstances by irritating or antagonizing an associate. If a stranger is summoned, the case is somewhat different. The doc\u00ac tor will see the patient, talk learnedly about the malady, and then assure the distressed family that their physician has done about the right thing, though owing to a complication that has appar\u00ac ently just arisen he would suggest a certain modification of the treatment which he will communicate to the physician in charge. And so the farce is over and the patient perhaps doomed, simply because the code values a doctor's reputation and dignity above that of a human life.\" In another case referred to by the same physician, it seems that a lady of wealth and social position had employed an emi\u00ac nent doctor and paid him liberally to remove her appendix. He performed the operation and she felt much better. She was loud in her praise of him. The next year she became suddenly ill. The eminent doctor was away and she sent for another who told her that she had appendicitis. She was thunderstruck. As she grew worse, another operation was then performed and the appendix removed, although she had already paid a high price a year before for its removal. In still another case involving the methods in vogue in hos\u00ac pitals the author of the work referred to speaks of an accident in which a woman had a fracture of the arm, a common injury which yields in every instance to ordinary skill. But as the arm was bruised and discolored, the hospital surgeon, without advising the woman, gave her a sleep producing drug and amputated the whole arm! Doctor Barnesby says: \"This, I will admit, is one of the most outrageous cases of malpractice I have ever known. Such a monstrous blunder may seem almost incredible, but the facts are RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 173 exactly as I have related them. A malpractice suit is on foot. If it comes up for trial the surgeon will have several of his clique on the stand to swear that there was nothing else to do under the circumstances. They will perjure themselves, of course, but this is the proper etiquette under such compromising conditions. Many another surgical malfactor has escaped in this manner when, if justice were done, he would now be serving time in the State's prison, or waiting his turn in the electric chair.\" It is a well understood fact, known not only to the medical profession, but to the public as well, that doctors must, by their code, swear falsely on the stand whenever it is necessary by so doing to save their associates from verdicts for damages, or pun\u00ac ishment at law. This willingness to commit perjury which is in itself a serious crime, shows the extent of the wickedness that pre\u00ac vails among the doctors. To merely lie may not be a crime; it may indicate nothing more than dishonesty; but to swear falsely in a court trial is perjury, one of the most black-hearted of crimes. There is not the slightest doubt that ninety per cent, of the doc\u00ac tors are willing to thus debase themselves. Who, then, is safe? But we think there is a still greater source of danger that has been launched on the public by the doctors in the last few years. It is briefly stated as follows: Owing to the discovery by chemists of many subtle poisons, and of many slightly injurious agents that can be introduced into the human body without means of detection, so small a quantity as one-hundredth of a grain may be added to a medicine or drug and escape any analysis except the most searching. It is for the interest of chemists who prepare drugs, and also for the interest of druggists as well as doctors, to maintain a perpetual attack on the human system. In addition to this means of keeping a person from getting permanently well, there is a still more subtle process which does not involve the chemist or the druggist, but rests wholly in the machinations of the physician. Today science has advanced far enough to ascertain that certain elements and compounds will unite with certain organs or parts of the body, while letting other parts alone; and that some medicines will relieve a malady while set\u00ac ting up another form of slow, but chronic irritation elsewhere in the body. 174 PERSONAL BOOK Thus the chemist, the druggist, and the doctor possess today the means, each independent of the other, of prolonging sickness, but when all three combine, as their interests dictate, what escape has the sick man or woman? If your body has received a terrible wound which is almost healed when a doctor tears it open afresh, what are you going to do if he continues this practice indefinitely ? Yet the hidden wounds in your body are known to him if he is skillful; and if he belongs to the ninety per cent., and you pay your bills, he does not intend the hidden wound to get wholly well. If you fall into the quicksand and a doctor succeeds in reach\u00ac ing you and ties a rope to your leg, he thus prevents you from sinking to your immediate death, and he has you in his power. The rope will not let you perish, for when you sink too far, the doctor pulls your leg and you are brought partly back to solid ground; but he knows how to keep you from getting back to per\u00ac manent safety, and this he will not do as long as he can extract money from you. Did you ever see a big cat play with a small mouse? The cat does not let the mouse die, but allows it some freedom, and a hundred times the mouse thinks he is just on the edge of freedom when the claws and the teeth of the cat pull him back into cap\u00ac tivity. The onlooker knows that the mouse can never get away, no matter how much latitude and independence are given him. So in the medical profession today, among the ninety per cent, of the doctors, it is a game of big cat and little mouse; of quicksand and leg-pulling; of the never healing wound in the body, and the best part of the condition is that the public are wak\u00ac ing up to the truth. Not only the great Carnegie institution, not only the advanced sciences, not only leading periodicals, not only conscientious doctors, but the intelligent force of the public search\u00ac light everywhere can be seen taking concerted action against the ninety per cent of dishonest doctors. In that ninety per cent are many great physicians and surgeons of mighty fame and high rep\u00ac utation. The test is this: Does the doctor permanently cure his pa\u00ac tients if they obey his instructions and are reasonably careful in their habits? If not, then he is either dishonest or stupid. The Ralston Health Club, without using medicines or apparatus, brings its patients into complete health, and they remain well all their RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 175 lives. On the other hand, the patrons of physicians keep on doc\u00ac toring and feeing their doctors all their lives. That is one side of the question. On the other side we find physicians who are honest. We know they are honest because their patients get well and stay well, and their further practice does not come from those whom they have cured, but from those who seek aid because of the recom\u00ac mendation given by those who are cured. Thus if the doctor per\u00ac manently cures A., he loses A's future patronage; but he secures new patronage from A's friends and acquaintances ever after. If A. sends fifty new patients to the doctor, the latter's practice is sure to increase,and if the fifty new patrons send each a number, then the increase will steadily grow. This is not theory, but it is actual fact that is today being demonstrated as the \"new ethics of the medical profession.\" Doc\u00ac tors who cure permanently in a brief period of time, and at mini\u00ac mum expense, are sure of an immense practice, as soon as these facts are known. The question then arises. How can a doctor who permanently cures his patient expect to find patrons enough to give him an increasing practice ? The answer is that he will find them among the patients of the ninety per cent, of dishonest physicians; for it is correctly estimated that less than ten per cent, are trustworthy. The vast majority are piling up human wrecks as fast as they can; and it is the duty of all good Ralstonites to aid in diverting this horde' of unfortunate victims away from their danger into the right direction. A woman who is a loyal and enthusiastic Ralstonite tried to induce a large number of her friends to join the Club. Some did join and were made well and have remained well. Others thought nothing could cure them unless prescribed by doctors. The wo\u00ac man says: \"Seeing the bent of their minds I asked the names of the doctors they had consulted. I then found that these doctors had a long list of patients who were chronic sufferers. I next found a doctor who really cured his patients. He told me quietly that he was a Ralstonite. I induced one of the uncured women to take her case to him, and in a very short time she was well, and is well today. This cure convinced the other women, and they went to him and were cured. All of us are now sounding his praises, and he is curing the patients that the other doctors have kept sick so 176 PERSONAL BOOK many years. The thought occurs to me that all good Ealstonites should do likewise. Hunt up a regular doctor who honestly wants to cure his patients, and take to him all people who think they need medical help and who will not join the Ealston Club.\" It makes no difference how a person gets well, if he only is made permanently well. That is all we ask. If therefore your friends who are always doctoring, will not take up the powerful system set forth in this book, but think they must have medical treatment, then you can do them and humanity a great service by hunting up some doctor who cures and whose patients, once cured, never have to doctor again all their lives. Find that kind of a doc\u00ac tor. It is often the case that he is a Ealstonite. If he is not, then help him to get all the light on Ealstonism that you can. A doctor may be honest who is not a Ealstonite; but you can rest assured that he is unknowingly making use of the great basic truths taught in this book. A dishonest doctor, one of the ninety per cent, could not pos\u00ac sibly be a Ealstonite. His one great purpose is to keep his patients sick, or half well, or half cured, like the cat playing with the mouse. When a doctor is a Ealstonite, that fact is prima-facie evi\u00ac dence that he is honest; for he is sure to permanently cure his pa\u00ac tients if they obey him. He can be honest and not be a Ealstonite, but he cannot be a Ealstonite and be dishonest. We are constantly having applications from physicians who wish to join this Club. From that time forth they become valuable physicians in their communities, for their lives are devoted to the permanent cure of their patients. Their success in one case brings new patrons and they in time are sure to have the leading practice. It is a well established principle that medicines never cured a human being, and never will. But this does not mean that they are not useful in a crisis, or in an acute attack. In such instances, the man or woman is foolish who will not employ a doctor. An honest physician is always a benefit to every person who suffers. It is a duty to call in medical aid when circumstances require im\u00ac mediate help. For this reason it is a great advantage to have a doctor at hand who is a Ealstonite. 'Can you find one or more in your com\u00ac munity? If you can, let him know that you can help him, that other Ealstonites can help him, and that we can help him. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 177 If there is none, then can you discover the most honorable doctor there, and make a Ealstonite of him? We have said that there are many physicians who are Ealston- ites, and that more are constantly joining this Club. They are making permanent cures and their practice is increasing. How blind are those doctors who hate Ealstonism even as his dark majesty hates angels! When a doctor speaks against this Club you can be sure he knows of Ealstonism; and you should avoid him and have all your friends avoid him, for the person who knows our teachings and who is an enemy to them, belongs to the class referred to by Dr. Barnesby. They would swear falsely. He who would in this age of human suffering prolong the agony of the unfortunate who know not which way to turn for safety, is an enemy to his kind. The Ealston Health Club has but one great end in veiw which is that each Member shall become an example of perfect health. When any doctor can prove that he has the same end in view in his practice, then he can look with honest gaze into the eyes of his fellow mortals. In the midst of the debris of human suffering, in the chaos of physical wreckage that has been dumped into the lap of civiliza\u00ac tion by the great majority of practicing physicians of today, there are whole-souled men and women engaged in the noble work of saving as many of these victims as possible, saving them by the hardest kind of work and study and struggle, saving them from the hands of monsters who have made them useless to themselves and to the world, and seeking in sincerity to open the flood gates of a new life on earth. Forget not the test: The patient who is permanently cured at a minimum cost has an honest adviser; but the patient that is continually \"doctoring\" is the dupe of a schemer. The time has come when every person of intelligence should turn away from the direction of these growing dangers that men\u00ac ace the race, and should come into the fold of safety. There is but one place today where absolute safety from all these evils can be found, and it is in the Ealston Health Club. Others have been safe here for many, many years; why not you and your friends? If you and your loved ones become faithful Ealstonites, there will never be any danger of surgeons' knives or physicians' drugs. PERSONAL BOOK \"THE DEEDS THAT MAKE EARTH BETTER- FOURTH DEPARTMENT OF THE PERSONAL BOOK OF THE RALSTON HEALTH CLUB \"(fammmmt\" RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 179 BUSINESS DEPARTMENT. Chapter Twenty PERSONAL SYSTEM OF THE RALSTON HEALTH CLUB. FOR CLUB-NUMBER MEMBERS IS WELL KNOWN the entire system of the Ralston Health Club comprises one hundred degrees, arranged solely at the request of Members or for their benefit to reward them for their efforts in securing new members. So many persons regained health that their friends and neighbors wondered and asked them how they had done it. In reply they said they had found health by joining the Ralston Club. This caused many of the inquirers to likewise join. Soon a Mem\u00ac ber would be the means of adding many recruits; and as it was found necessary to recognize the good results, this led to the plan of degrees; one being awarded for each new member. Under the Personal System, this plan of degrees will be aban\u00ac doned. The Ralston Health Club will be limited to fifteen degrees, and specially powerful works will be included in that scope; thus accom\u00ac plishing more real good in fifteen degrees than was secured in one hundred degrees of elaborate emoluments. This does not mean that the former degrees will be taken away; we have no right to do that. All agreements will be fully carried out as made, and all Members under the high degree plan who wish to proceed with it will be allowed to do so. But we strongly advise all new Members to enter the present plan of the Personal System, and to seek fifteen degrees instead of the hundred, as the results are more concentrated and therefore much more powerful in each life. 180 PERSONAL BOOK THE PERSONAL SYSTEM OF THE CLUB is devoted solely to the needs of each Member, and to no other purpose. It consists of four works, each having a specific line of usefulness unequaled by any other work \"Personal Book\" is the present work. It is complete in itself, and covers all the ground needed. The book of \"Life Electricity\" contains a course of one hun\u00ac dred lessons including ten steps to graduation in reaching the life centers of the body; something that was never before attempted. It is designed for persons who have inherited a weak constitution. The book of \"Chest Culture\" is designed to make the fight specially for perfect lungs and a perfect heart, in this era when more than half of all humanity have weak lungs and a heart of low energy. These two organs give way at the present day very sud\u00ac denly, owing to the rush and hurry of living. Fifty per cent, of all deaths among women are now due to lung troubles; and seventy per cent, of all deaths among men are due either to lung disease or to heart failure. There was never a time when such a work as \"Chest Culture\" was so much needed as now. It has been in use for many years, and no person who has secured it in time has ever died of lung or heart disease. It is a perfect guaranty of safety; better than a policy of insurance. The fourth great course is known as \"Doctors of the Ralston Club,\" but the title of the giant work is \"Complete Membership.\" It enables any Ralstonite to cure others either in his family or among the neighbors, as it has a natural cure for all curable maladies. A letter just at hand from a Member says: \"I have cured seventeen cases of rheumatism in this locality by the treat\u00ac ment of the great Ralston Book. In all these cases, doctors and medicines were useless. I have not had a failure.\" Other Members have made all kinds of wonderful and almost miraculous cures, some for fame, some for financial reward, and some to win blessings that are beyond price. You can help human\u00ac ity best by first making yourself an example of perfect health RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 181 through the influence of the \"Personal Book.\" Let people see the change in you, and tell them the cause. Now what are you to do? You will be grateful and will frankly admit that your better condition is due to the great Personal System of the Ralston Health Club. If your less fortunate friends learn the cause, they will ask how THEY can secure similar benefits. You can\u00ac not keep the truth from them. They will see the wonderful change in you. In spite of all you can do, one or more of your friends will send for the \"Personal Book,\" and your Club-Number will receive credit for the recruits so brought into the Club. When your Club-Number has received one credit, you will be the owner of ONE HONOR, which will be recorded on our ledgers. When your Club-Number has received two credits, you will be the owner of TWO HONORS, etc. Now when your Club-Number has received five credits, you will be the owner of FIVE HONORS. This will mean that you have been the cause, willingly or unwillingly, of five persons joining the Club by procuring the \"Personal Book\" through your Invitations. Securing these FIVE HONORS has cost you nothing, not even any effort; and they will never be taken away from you. What will you do with your FIVE HONORS? You can sell them without losing them, which seems a paradox. If you so desire, you can sell them to the Ralston Health Club and receive five degrees and be recorded as a fifth degree Ralstonite; thereby receiving the great course known as \"LIFE ELECTRIC\u00ac ITY.\" You will thus have secured, free of all cost, one of the most important works in existence, and will also have sent five persons on the road to perfect health, happiness and long life. The whole process is simple and is being enacted every day in all parts of the world where Ralstonism is practiced: You improve your own health until your friends demand to know the cause; you tell them the cause; and they become Ralstonites. Could anything be easier? Could anything be grander? The Ralston Health Club, if it buys your FIVE HONORS and allows you five degrees, will give you free of all charge the most wonderful system ever taught for reaching the spark of life and increasing it. This is known as LIFE ELECTRICITY. 182 PERSONAL BOOK LIFE ELECTRICITY. It is the fifth degree work of the Personal System of the Ralston Health Club. It is so important that we are compelled to describe it very fully at this place. LIFE ELECTRICITY is a new use of the laws of nature! It is not in any way connected with magnetism and has noth\u00ac ing to do with that force. LIFE ELECTRICITY is founded on the recently made dis\u00ac covery that all weakness, all sickness, and all processes towards death begin in the nerve-centres; no matter what the affecting cause may be to start with. The course of One Hundred Lessons in Life Electricity builds up the nerve-centres, step by step, until they are so strong and so full of vitality and renewed life, that nothing can reach them to do harm. As they direct and control all functions of the or\u00ac gans of the body, this process means a wonderful improvement, and the coming in of a new life that is amazing in its power. All over the world the successful, honest physicians are pre\u00ac scribing our system of \"LIFE ELECTRICITY\" to their patients. One doctor said to a woman whom he had not been able to bring into good health: \"You inherit a weak constitution, and I might as well tell you now that you will find but one means of help worthy of notice, and that is the course of treatment called Life Electricity issued by the Ralston Health Club of Washington, D. C. I prescribe that in place of further medicine. I say this, knowing that I shall lose you as a patient in the future.\" It was a hard sacrifice to make, but the doctor was brave and honest. The woman secured \"Life Electricity.\" In one month she wrote: \"I began to get new life from the first day and now I am well and filled full of the happiness of living. But what about the physician who generously gave me up and has lost the hundreds of dollars he might have received from me had he not told me to buy the course in Life Electricity?\" How many doctors are willing to give up for life their pa\u00ac tients whose money flows steadily into their pockets? When once a physician prescribes \"Life Electricity\" to a patient, it is like dismissing that patient with the words: \"Good by. You are now leaving me forever. I have been honest with RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 183 you in prescribing Life Electricity in place of medicines. You have been paying me more than a hundred dollars a year. Here\u00ac after you will pay me nothing. I must live. For weeks I have been struggling against the desire to prescribe the Life Electricity course for you; but my conscience has won the victory. My in\u00ac come will be lessened, but you will get well/' Is your constitution weak? Has your vitality at any time been sapped to the core? Do you lack the courage and energy of purpose to make the fight for perfect health? You need LIFE ELECTRICITY. Many persons obtain the first book of the Ralston Health Club, but lack the will power to take up the battle of life for themselves. They are just the persons who need LIFE ELEC\u00ac TRICITY. Medicines will not help them. Doctors will not help them. Treatments will not help them. Travel and special systems of cure will never give them the slightest benefit. They lack that one fundamental essence of existence, courage of pur\u00ac pose for a brave fight; and this can come from only one source which is LIFE ELECTRICITY. It gives will-power, energy of mind and heart, ambition, ac\u00ac tive interest, and the driving enthusiasm that wins. As Theodore Roosevelt said to his fellow soldiers: \"I am no better than you are. Every one of you can do all I have done if you will fully make up your minds to do so.\" The inability to make up the mind is due to \"lack of human electrical energy\" as Edison puts it in his description of the man who fails because of a weak will power. Has your youth gone too early? Have your faculties lost their fullness of power? Are you nervous, depressed at times, disposed to be melan\u00ac cholic or apprehensive of the future years? Are you afraid of a breakdown in case you live to be old? Then NOW is the time to build LIFE ELECTRICITY. In placing this course of One Hundred Lessons and Steps to Graduation within reach of every man and woman at the Fifth Degree of the Ralston Health Club, this organization has done a great service to humanity; and all persons are wise who secure that great system as soon as possible. Five Honors will bring it to you. 184 PERSONAL BOOK \"CHEST CULTURE\" This is a name for a much greater course than it expresses. It is the Tenth Degree System of the Ralston Health Club. Ten Honors will secure it free; or five Honors after you win the Fifth Degree System. It is shown in the reports of mortality among adults, or persons above the age of eighteen years, that one person in every six dies of consumption; and as many more die of pneumonia or other form of lung trouble. It is also shown that, where tuberculosis is checked, either the heart is weakened, or the lungs become an easy prey to pneumonia. YOU will probably die of some form of lung or organic malady. A medical cure that drives out tuberculosis at the expense of the heart or other vital part, is substituting one evil for another. The error is in the basic methods. To make lung troubles and heart troubles IMPOSSIBLE, the great system known as \"CHEST CULTURE,\" was estab\u00ac lished years ago and has done more real good in the world than any other aid to suffering humanity. No person has died of any form of lung or heart disease who has made use of this System. It has a record unsurpassed in the history of the race. It proceeds as follows: 1. Its first great work is to cure all weak lung-cells. 2. It then brings into use the thousands of lung-cells that are left undeveloped; for it proves that in every case of weak lungs and consumption, there are great masses of unused cells which, if they are not developed, will die with the individual. 3. It proves that the germs of tuberculosis present in the lungs, will all be killed and driven out by the method employed in this great system. 4. The difference between the most modern treatment of con\u00ac sumption in sanatoriums, and CHEST CULTURE, is that the former seeks to nourish the body to the highest degree of endur\u00ac ance and thus establish a competition between the germs of death and those of life; while CHEST CULTURE slays ALL the germs at once, drives them OUT, and then repairs the cells that are hurt, while it OPENS the unused cells and sets them to work. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 185 By this method there is never any chance for the disease itself; it is doomed the moment the patient begins the adoption of the System of CHEST CULTURE. 5. It changes the chest-frame, giving it a new shape and a proper carriage; filling in all hollows in the upper right and left zones where you are certainly hollow now; and it beautifies the neck, the form of the shoulders and the entire region, thus pro\u00ac ducing a marvelous perfection of the body where it counts most for appearance as well as health. There is no other method to be found in this wide world that can do any of these things. All parents, all children, and all persons who seek to be kingly and queenly in bearing and demeanor, should begin at once the prac\u00ac tice of CHEST CULTURE. 6. By bringing the vital zone into its best form, it invites an ideal shape of the entire body. The step changes; the car\u00ac riage is much more graceful; the individual becomes easy and full of attractive manliness and womanliness; and nature is at her best in the temple of life. 7. All the faults of form are studied and overcome. 8. A magnificent presence takes the place of the old ways. 9. The CHEST is the seat of life, the seat of vitality, the seat of magnetism, the seat of the soul. Hot only in outward form should it be developed; not only in its inward vitality and nealth should it be cultivated; but as the zone of life where the spark of human existence is every moment being created, the CHEST should be brought into a new heritage. This has been done by the method of the System described, and is going on now in every part of the civilized world where our members are for\u00ac tunate enough to possess this grand work. 10. All the laws of grace are studied and the body is made easy and naturally refined in all its motions and attitudes. The relation between a depressed and faulty carriage of the chest and the attendant errors of the body is thoroughly shown and cor\u00ac rected step by step until they disappear. This remarkable System of CHEST CULTURE is placed at the Tenth Degree of the Ralston Health Club. The members are fortunate indeed to be able to secure so great a boon to life. A total of fifteen HONORS, or five in addition to the last number referred to, will bring you to: 186 PERSONAL BOOK \"DOCTORS\" OF THE RALSTON HEALTH CLUB. This is the name of the Complete Membership System; so called because it contains treatments for each and every curable disease in the whole list of human ills. They are issued all in one giant book under the name of \"COMPLETE MEMBERSHIP BOOK\" When there is any fixed disease of which some person in your family or among your neighbors is the victim, then you call a DOCTOR of the Ralston Health Club; which is done by employing the proper line of treatment set forth in the System of Complete Membership. If you have but two books, it is certainly far better to own the Personal Book, and \"Life Electricity.\" Together they will make you wonderfully secure against sickness. If you can have but three books, you should have the Per\u00ac sonal Book, also \"Life Electricity,\" and \"CHEST CULTURE.\" Since the chances are that you will otherwise die either of con\u00ac sumption or pneumonia, this plan of safety will make such result impossible. You will be independent of all such dangers. This security is worth more than a fortune of a million dollars. The fourth and last course in the Ralston Health Club is established to enable you to do good in the world. You do not wish to go through life without helping your fellow beings. Sup\u00ac pose you were to come into an immense fortune and were to have much more of this world's goods than you could ever use for your\u00ac self ; or suppose, by hard effort carried through many years, you were to win success: what then? Is life well spent that is devoted to you alone? There are many persons of humble means who deem it a part of right living to help their friends and neighbors. Most people are lacking in health. Around you there are some who can never get well if they are to look to medicines for relief. There are consumptives in your town who have been failing steadily under the treatment of medicines. Somewhere else there are high priced sanatoriums where men and women are actually cured of consumption; but they never give medicines! The expert physicians know that it is a crime today to use medicines in this malady. The success\u00ac ful sanatoriums are using the methods that were inaugurated more than thirty years ago by the Ralston Health Club in the cure of RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 187 this all-prevailing malady. This is the method that is employed in the great book which we call \"DOCTORS\" of this Club, or technically known as Complete Membership. That method actually cures. It makes a direct attack on the disease itself; while CHEST CULTURE builds a magnificent body and extends its work through a whole volume to the most needed of all means of help to mankind. Now this is one only of the \"DOCTORS;\" this treatment that is contained in the Book of Complete Membership. There are more than forty others. To show you what can be done let us quote a part of a letter from a woman who has all these courses of the Club: \"I have enjoyed such perfect health myself that my neighbors often ask me how I got well after I gave up using medicines. With the exception of the book to begin with, my other hooks cost me nothing, as I won them by taking de\u00ac grees. I found around me a number of women who could do the same, but who do not have the ambition to help themselves.. One by one they fail and die. Since they will not do for themselves and try to get well, I deem it my duty to help them all I can. By the aid of Complete Membership I have saved from death a beautiful young girl who was far gone with tuberculosis. A young man has also been saved solely by my effort. I am now doing for others and will have very soon a role of a dozen or more vic\u00ac tories. These folks who are brought to good health from the very edge of the grave, really become useful citizens. They are strong and able to work. The young man is now helping to save two others who were very far gone with the same disease. I have never known what happiness is in this life until I was able to give my knowledge to others. When I see people about me who are alive and well, hut who would have been in their graves but for me, my heart leaps with joy at the pleasure of doing good. Now I enjoy living because I have given life to others.\" This strikes the keynote of it all. Take another instance. A man who had suffered from rheu- matism for many years despite his use of medicines, became wholly well by the methods of our Complete Membership. Then he hunted up all persons he knew who had rheumatism, and he cured them. In another community a member of this Club who had come into perfect health, heard of a very wealthy business man 388 PERSONAL BOOK who was dying of nervous prostration due to inability to sleep nights. The merchant said he would give his fortune to any one who could save him. Expert physicians tried and failed. Our member took to the sufferer the treatment which is provided in the book of Complete Membership, and the very first night the rich man got some sleep; the second night he got more; and in a short time he was entirely well. Many Ealstonites are practicing nature today and receiving financial rewards by so doing; but most of them love the work of saving life and not making a business of it. In every grade of social rank there are men and women who are helping others to get well; in other words, they are practicing Ealstonism, or nature, by employing the \"DOCTOES\" of the Ealston Health Club. Almost everything is reached by that giant System. Stomach troubles, nervous disorders, blood defects, organic weakness, skin eruptions, heart, liver and kidney maladies, and everything that has not passed into the incurable stage. We claim to have the only certain cure for diabetes. A man who was made well of this disease when all hope had gone, has since helped eight others to recovery. He used the great volume of Complete Membership, which we call \"DOCTOES\" of the Club. Headaches and weakness of the nerves are today bringing more misery to people than they are able to endure; yet they are sure of finding relief and permanent cures in Complete Mem\u00ac bership. These are examples only of the greatness and vast import\u00ac ance of the giant work. It has been before the public for more than twenty years and has been steadily growing all the time in order to keep up to date, so that nothing shall exceed it in value. . completes the courses of the Ealston Health Club, for which reason it is called Complete Membership. Being a Degree book it may be obtained free of expense at the Fifteenth Degree which is the last under the new or Personal System. HOW TO GO AHEAD. Let us assume that you can own the Personal Book, which is the volume now open before you; and that you have none of the other courses as yet. If you possess ambition to attain wonderful health, you will adopt all the teachings of this book. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 189 You will change completely. Even your identity and ap\u00ac pearance can be so changed that you will seem to others to be a new individual. This is true ambition, for the human body is the Temple of Life. You cannot escape the attention of others. They will want to know how it is done. Strangers from afar will hear of you. This has been the history in the past, and is bound to be the history of the future. Invitations which we send to you freely, will always be on hand in your house, and all you need do is to answer every inquiry by an Invitation. If people ask your advice from a distance, just mail them Invitations bearing your Club Number. As you are allowed Members' discounts, all persons who receive your Invitations must mention your Club Number in or\u00ac der to receive the discounts which you have the power to give them. Thus your Club Number will be credited with the ac\u00ac ceptances of the Invitations which you send to other people. Every such acceptance brings you AN HONOR. Some persons have thus received hundreds of HONORS. You need only fifteen to bring you to the highest Degree of the Ralston Health Club, which is the Fifteenth Degree. But when you have received only FIVE HONORS the Club will buy them of you, and you need not wait till you have reached the fifteen. The Club buys them of you by paying you in De\u00ac grees, each HONOR being good for a Degree. Five HONORS, if you wish to sell them, will be exchanged for five Degrees; and then you will be entitled to the great System of \"Life Electric\u00ac ity,\" free of all charge of every kind. It will be sent to you at the expense of the Club. Soon, however, you will find that you have reached TEN HONORS. If you wish to sell them, the Club will buy them by giving you in exchange the Tenth Degree; and you can then claim CHEST CULTURE free; all cost of delivery being paid by the Club. These must be obtained in their order. Foundation course: \"Personal Book.\" \"DOCTORS\" of the Ralston Health Club; known as Complete Membership. 190 PERSONAL BOOK THE INCREASE OF HONORS. A healthy mind is necessary to a healthy body. Enthusiasm is the magnetic stimulus to a healthy mind. Therefore you should become an enthusiastic Ralstonite. Let the Club be known. This you can do without soliciting new Members. Let its existence be known by answering all re\u00ac quests for information by Invitations which speak for themselves. If there are some about you who are ill, help them without asking them to buy a book of membership. Help them freely without seeking any reward or advantage. If others are ill who are not near at hand, merely send them Invitations to which your Club Number is added. Let the existence of the Club be known at all times. It is your Club. All the funds that the Ralston Health Club has received in the many years of its existence have been spent in its work, and not a cent has ever gone to the benefit of an owner or officer. Besides such receipts, many thousands of dol\u00ac lars have been contributed by private individuals to carry on its vast plan of saving life and lessening human suffering. There\u00ac fore it has no interest in the commercial side of its business; nor does it ask its Members to become agents for the sale of books. Like a church, or any fraternal organization, this Club wants its good work known; and the best way of making it known is by the use of its Invitations which are granted freely to Members. The Club makes no pretence of charity. It charges a low price for life membership including its Personal Book; and it sends for life to all Members who desire them, its reports and greetings; so that the small fee which is hardly the value of the Personal Book is eventually used up in carrying the membership. The early members gave a large fortune to the Club. In addition to this, the Club buys of its Members all HON\u00ac ORS up to and including the Fifteenth. As these HONORS have cost the Members nothing, the purchase of them whereby they are turned into Degrees, means a large expense to the Club. This plan was originated many years ago by the Members themselves, and consented to by us. It was based on the fact that, if a Mem\u00ac ber becomes an example of fine health, he cannot keep that fact from the world, and others are bound to come into the Club, thus bringing credit to that Member which is rewarded by HON\u00ac ORS, one for each new recruit. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 191 ADDITIONAL HONORS If you come into possession of HONORS and do not wish to Bell them to the Club; or, if you secure more than fifteen HON\u00ac ORS, you can sell them to Ralston University Company in ex\u00ac change for still greater values. To illustrate this point, suppose you have obtained fifteen HONORS and do not wish to sell them to the Ralston Health Club for Degrees; you can sell them to Ralston University Company, of which the club is a part or branch. Or suppose you do sell all fifteen HONORS to the Club, and should have more HONORS, perhaps twenty, or fifty or any number; the excess can be sold to Ralston University Company in exchange for other and greater values. All this is fully explained in the booklet which can be had for nothing by applying to Ralston Health Club, Hopewell, New Jersey. The title of that booklet is \"Sjrnuir Hah\u00bba\" It tells you what can be done even if you were to secure a great number of HONORS. While you cannot sell the same HONORS twice, your sale of them does not lessen the number you obtain. If you were to secure fifteen and sell them to the Club for Degrees, you would still have fifteen HONORS. You do not lose them by selling them; but those that have been once sold cannot be sold again. Cash is never paid for HONORS either by the Club or the Ralston University Company; but some\u00ac thing better and more valuable is given in the purchase. For the same reason we do not sell HONORS for cash. You cannot buy an HONOR by sending us the price of a Personal Book; but if any other person, mentioning your Club Number, sends to us the price of a Personal Book intending to become a Ralstonite, then that person receives the book and much more than full value for his money, while you receive the HONOR. All new recruits must be genuine. Some members seek to win Honors by buying copies of the \"Personal Book\" to give away to others. This serves the purpose only when the others really become genuinely interested. Connected with this branch of the present work are coupons which you are entitled to use by cutting them off one at a time as you require them. 192 PERSONAL BOOK PERSONAL ADVICE FREE. We aid all Members who are trying to help themselves. We have found that the present system of the Personal Book exerts so great an influence on the lives of all persons who take an interest in its teachings, that the most important step is to become familiar with those teachings. This is done, not by one reading, but by several. You may feel sure that you can grasp all that is said when you peruse this book once; but the person does not live who will not find many new truths in its pages on every repeated reading even up to the twelfth. Therefore if you will carefully, slowly, patiently and thor\u00ac oughly read every word of this book once a month for twelve months, you will be given the rank of good standing in our records. There will come times when you will need personal advice on matters that cannot be found in any of our books. The Ealston Health Club stands unique in the world. For nearly thirty-five years it has been the one great investigator of nat\u00ac ural causes and natural cures of disease without the use of medi\u00ac cines or apparatus of any kind. It has saved more than a mil\u00ac lion people from untimely death; it has cured countless others of maladies that doctors could not cure; and it has done more than any other agency to relieve human suffering. All this time it has never advertised, and has never made display of any kind. Carrying no salaried officials, having no luxurious offices, sound\u00ac ing no public trumpet, it has gone on with its grand work in silence and with victories unparalleled in the history of mankind. During all this time, and amidst this accumulation of experiences, it has gathered knowledge of so great volume and value that it now has at its disposal mountains of facts. Our books aim to contain nearly everything that is helpful; but there are many subjects of importance that do not get inside the pages of any book. No two cases are alike. Sometimes our Members need advice and need it urgently. Our practice hereto\u00ac fore has been to make moderate charges for personal advice by mail; ranging from one dollar up to five and even as high as twenty-five dollars per letter. A large part of this cost consists in the time required to secure the information and to verify its accuracy, as well as writing the reply. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 193 Under the Personal Book system, which is the most liberal ever established, we will try for a while to give private advice free of charge, if the following Buies are observed : Rule 1.\u2014The Free Personal Advice is not a right to be claimed by a Member, but is a gratuity from us. This hook has not been sold on the promise to give such advice. The Personal Book itself is worth much more than the price charged for it. No promise of free advice was made as an inducement to pur\u00ac chase the book. Rule 2.\u2014The Member must become interested in the Ral\u00ac ston Health Club; must be enthusiastic in speaking of the Club to others; and must try to adopt its teachings so as to become an example of what the Club can really do. The least interest one can take is to read this book through twelve times, once a month for twelve months. There will never be a case where adoption of its truths will not follow twelve such readings. Rule 3.\u2014The Advice Form at the end of this section must be copied, not cut out. If cut, it will cause loss of standing as a Ralstonite. Rule 4.\u2014The inquiry must be plainly written and must not contain more than one hundred words. Long letters cannot be read, and of course not answered. The name and address of the writer must be plain and complete; and the Personal Club Num\u00ac ber given correctly. Rule 5.\u2014The subject of the advice sought must be some\u00ac thing that is not published in our books. Rule 6.\u2014No fees of any kind are required. Most Members, however, send us a few stamps when they write, asking us to \"use them for the good of the Club.\" If stamps are included, they should be so noted in the letter, as we wish to account for the same. Stamps should be \"ones\" or \"twos\" of the United States, as foreign stamps cannot be used. We are always for- waiding to countless numbers of people, not only our Invitations for their benefit, but an almost unlimited mail that brings us no returns; and stamps flow from our office in a steady stream, pil\u00ac ing up an expense that would be relieved if each Member would bear a part of it. But this we do not ask. That matter is left wholly to your inclination. SCOPE OF THE ADVICE. All Ralstonites who are brought into perfect health quickly seek new channels of usefulness in this world by joining our two 194 PERSONAL BOOK other organizations, the Magnetism Club, and the Psychic So\u00ac ciety, admission to which is free under the Honor System de\u00ac scribed in the booklet. Honor Values, which can be obtained with\u00ac out cost by using the Coupon on the final page of this book. In those two societies many questions arise as to the power of personal achievement, especially in the Magnetism Club, and we are often asked for private advice and help along lines wholly new. We try in every way to assist all ambitious persons. When the health is perfect, there are faculties that must be given means of development and new realms of usefulness; other\u00ac wise a person of perfect health would be no greater a being than an animal. Faculties are implements by which power and suc\u00ac cess are achieved in this world. A weak body makes an irritated mind. A well body induces a vigorous mind, in which are born multitudes of wholesome desires for doing things of importance while life is at its best. How magnetism is not hypnotism; the latter puts to sleep or dulls the will of the subject; while magnetism arouses, charms and attracts. It is, therefore, just the opposite of hypnotism. Personal magnetism is personal worth. It is value added to every trait of the mind and heart. It intensifies the charm of conduct, of speech, of intercourse, of self-possession, of splendid control, of every attractive quality that is natural; and all the while there are exercises of the most powerful character that develop fire of nerves, of eye, of heart and of mind to a degree that is astounding. It is thus easy to see why every healthy man and woman enters the Magnetism Club. Then there are many questions as to the methods of controlling others in the family, in the busi\u00ac ness world, in the professions, in society, and everywhere, with\u00ac out manifest effort; and these we try to answer whenever a Mag\u00ac netism Club Member writes to us, provided the answer is not already given in the magnetism books. We cannot re-write the books in letters. The Psychic Society is a still grander organization, and the Members of that club often ask for private advice. The word Psychic means mind, but mind of a higher grade than the animal or brute intelligence. It is that state of mind that is above the lower forms of life. True Psychic intelligence has nothing to do with cults, or fads, or spirits, or anything but the two great minds of the universe. It is admitted on every hand RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 195 that the most important study of the coming decade will be that of psychic laws. Humanity is turning from the present day cli\u00ac max of the material, to the true knowledge of the mind in its two gigantic realms. The Psychic Society deals only with facts. It has nothing to do with the occult; but on the other hand confronts all occult phenomena with an array of facts recently discovered that make all mysteries as clear as the light of the sun. The greatest misfortune of humanity is its slavery to super\u00ac stition, fear, depressing influences, forebodings, and belief in luck and chance. Suicides and insanity follow such slavery. The health suffers, and many incurable cases are made so by the evil that hangs like a pall over such a mind. Here is where the Psy\u00ac chic Society brings good health when all other hope is lost. Only a short time ago, a young woman of wealth was given up by her physicians when she went into a rapid decline. Nothing would save her, it seemed. She joined our Psychic Society, her mind was cleared at once, and she is today in perfect health of mind and body. Private advice is given to our Psychic Members under the rules.

Ralstonism is on the eve of a great and far-reaching move\u00ac ment! Gather all yonr forces together as soon as possible! The years passed have served to test the great strength of the Ralston Doctrines. They are right. They have won the approval of good men and women. They have endured and overwhelmed all ad\u00ac verse criticism because they are right. We ask no gifts of money or labor, no open efforts on your part; nothing but your ever present desire to make the great principles of health known to others. This is all; wherever we refer to active loyalty, remember what it means. Now think of the revolution that must eventually be wrought in the world if each member of the Health Club is actively loyal. That desire to win others to your great doctrines will eventually develop into an influence; and one by one, like stars beginning to shine at night, your influences will blossom into results, and you will have won members into your club. Think, too, what a moral change will be wrought; for all physiologists agree that ill health causes irritability, morbid nerves, defective moral nature, and more than nine-tenths of all the wrong in the world. The key of moral reform is turned by the hand of Health. The Ralston Club can never die. It was wrought in inspira\u00ac tion, and its principles are Nature's richest laws, framed by an all-wise Creator solely and absolutely for man's happiness. Its plan of existence reaches far forward into a rapidly multiplying growth which no power of man can check. The many great names now enrolled upon its list, and the intense interest they take in spreading its influence and increasing its membership speak of a Higher Power working in the hearts of men and women to make the world better. RALSTON HEALTH CLUB 197 \u00a9t}? \u00aetfm Coupons This copy of the Personal Book is perfect when, at the time it is delivered to the person who is to own and use it, there are attached Three Coupons on one page, following these two pages. of description. It is imperfect when the Three Coupons have been removed by some person who is not the owner and personal user of this copy. For these reasons you should be very careful not to deliver to another person this copy if it does not contain all Three Coupons; as it will lead to trouble and loss of rights which go with the volume. As soon as you have decided to dedicate this copy to your own use, then appropriate the Three Coupons. This is right. They belong to you as the personal user. THE FIRST COUPON 1. Membership Card.\u2014The possession of this Personal Book gives you the right of life membership if you wish it. No Club Number is necessary unless you wish to have HONORS; in which case a Membership Card is necessary, bearing your Club Number. The Membership Card is good all over the world. By show\u00ac ing it you establish your right to be known as a Ralstonite. THE SECOND COUPON 2. Honor Values.\u2014The next coupon is to be used to ask for a free copy of the booklet of HONOR VALUES, which will explain how you may dispose of HONORS in case you have an accumulation of them. While there are other courses of reading and study that are for sale by Ralston Company, of which this Club is a part, it is our sincere desire that you do NOT BUY anything further of us, as we want you to receive everything free under the plan set forth in HONOR VALUES. THE THIRD COUPON 3. Invitations.\u2014The third coupon is one that asks for In\u00ac vitations to the Ralston Health Club. These are sent freely, and you in ay have as many as you will use judiciously. At first it may be well to send for twenty Invitations. Then you may send 198 PERSONAL BOOK for more at any time you desire, and as often as you wish. Sim\u00ac ply state your Club Number when you write for them. A Club Number will not be issued to a person who does not own a Personal Book and keep the same for individual use. A Personal Book can be used but once for the purpose of securing a Club Number. Two persons cannot obtain Club Num\u00ac bers from the same Personal Book. There is so much in the book that requires individual use and ownership that every man and woman should have a copy. In a family of man and wife, the husband, without suggestion, procured a copy of the first book for both. In a family of four children and two elders, six copies were bought, so that each could have an individual book and all could count themselves Ralstonites. The FIRST COUPON on the next page is of great value, be\u00ac cause it enables you to secure a Membership Card, and a Club Number, which is absolutely necessary before you can begin to take HONORS. Therefore see at the start if the First Coupon is in this book. If it is not, find out of whom you obtained the book. We never send them out unless each copy is verified and the First Coupon known to be in its place herein. It is a seriously defective book if such Coupon is lacking. The only thing to do is to find the person from whom you got the book and demand a perfect copy. If that is not possible, then send the defective book back to us, and remit $1.25 for a perfect copy. As we never send out books that lack the First Coupon, we cannot exchange the books free. After you once obtain a supply of Invitations and need more, you can write for them; always letting us know your Club Num\u00ac ber, as we do not know you by name. Without knowing your Club Number we cannot find your records; nor can we award HONORS. Therefore it is highly im\u00ac portant that you never fail to send your Club Number. Many members have it engraved on their letter heads as a coat-of-arms, and even attach it to everything that it can be placed upon. HONOR VALUES. * * * This booklet, which is known as \"Honor Values\" is a gold mine of splendid surprises for you, and a copy should be in your possession as soon as possible.
