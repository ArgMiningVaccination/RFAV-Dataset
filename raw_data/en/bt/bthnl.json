The microbes are also known as pathogens. A microbe infects an organism (which is known as the host of the microbe). In a human host, the microorganism causes a disease by either disrupting an important body process or by stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. The pathogen, interferes with the normal functioning of the host and can lead to chronic wounds, gangrene, loss of an infected limb, and even death. The host's response to infection is inflammation. An interaction between parasite and host, whereby the relationship is beneficial for the former but detrimental to the latter, is characterized as parasitism. Scientific research seems very factual and straight-forward. In reality, science deals with uncertainty, something that, when not used in the right way, creates weaknesses. The uncertainty of scientific research allows scientists to explore intellectually as well as creatively, and \"venture into the unknown\" to create the known. In his account from The Great Influenza, John M. Barry uses formal diction, strategically placed rhetorical questions, and an appeal to logos to characterize scientific research. Staphylococcus epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogen, meaning that they can cause infection more frequently and more easily in persons' with a weakened immune system such as, HIV patients (CDC, 2015). This organism is seen primarily in nosocomial infections, also known as, hospital-acquired infections (Bukhari, 2004). This means that the organisms favors the hospital environment and is easily passed to a person while they are in the hospital. Ways that a person can get a Staphylococcus epidermidis infection is through IV's, more commonly in drug users, catheters, and artificial equipment (Bukhari, 2004). Skin-to-skin contact can also be a form of getting this type of infection. The people that are most susceptible to get Staphylococcus epidermidis are newborns, the elderly, immunocompromised patients, and patient's who are using a catheter. This is because newborns and the elderly do not have as strong of immune systems as children and middle-age adults Attention getter: Danny Thomas,opened the doors to St. Jude Research Hospital on February 4, 1962 in front of a crowd of 9,000 people. The building was star-shaped and designed by an African American designer named Paul Revere Williams. In 1969 the Hospital expanded and welcomed a patient care center with Hillary Clinton With a little less than a month to go in this school year it's very common this time of the year for students here at West Central to come down with the disease that has pledged students for years. The disease is called Senioritis and it 's spreading through the halls at West Central at a remarkable rate. Senioritis is defined by Wikipedia as \" a decreased motivation toward studies displayed by students who are nearing the end of their high school, college, and graduate school careers. It combines the word senior with the suffix -itis, which technically denotes inflammation, but in colloquial speech is assumed to mean a general illness.\" Although many medical professionals don 't see this as a real condition or a real disease, many 1. Simply Put, the flu shot is an injection (shot) or nasal spray that contains a harmless amount of the virus, so that your body can build up antibodies against that strain of the flu. Do you know why it is important to get children, teens, and adults vaccinated? Well I'll let you know why it is important. The first reason why to get vaccinated is because you have a less likely chance to catch a disease. The second reason why it is important to get vaccinated is because a disease can turn into a worldwide epidemic. The last and third reason is so you can maintain a healthy life. These are the most important reasons in my opinion that all people should be vaccinated. Healthcare. We all need it, but we don't all have it, and because of that simple fact, we are one of the sickest countries in the industrial world. Our life expectancy for the first time ever is going down, not up. We have the highest maternal mortality rates in the industrial world. And the worst outcomes per cost anywhere. The Staphylococcus Epidermidis is classified as bacteria. Scientists reckon it to Firmicutes phylum and adjust it in Bacillales order of Bacilli class. This bacteria belongs to Staphylococcaceae family. As the name order, it is settled into Staphylococcus genus and S. Epidermidis species. S. Epidermidis makes its home on human skin, mucosal layer and nasal mucosa. Diseases can be taken form in human body and warm-blooded animals such as septicemia and endocarditis. In fact, S. Epidermidis is not too harmful on healthy tissue. The infection often occurs on newborn baby, drug users, and older people and those who need to use assistant devices on every part Silicone. I'm sure you have all heard of this substance before. But it's more than an element on the periodic table, we actually encounter it in our everyday lives whether you like it or not. Let's bring in a show of hands, who here has ever used moisturizer? Hmm. okay who here has ever used any kind of makeup? Last but not least, who here has ever used shampoo? Sorry to break it to you but unless you spend more than $50 on a single bottle of shampoo, silicone is in your everyday lives. The presence of a suture in a surgical wound has been found to increase the tissue's susceptibility to infection.(10) (3) Occurrence of bacteria inside a wound does not always implicate an infection. Altemir and Culbert(29) have suggested that the infection risk depends upon the host resistance, bacterial contamination and virulence of the organism. In human volunteers, Elek and Conen(3) have noted that an injection of 106 Staphylococcus pyogenes was required to elicit a pus-forming clinical infection. When a silk sutures was introduced into the same conditions only 100 staphylococci were enough to form pus. The results of this study indicate that the introduction of staphylococci on a silk suture can enhance the development of infection as much as 10,000 fold. It's a virus where itchy red blisters appear in your whole body, it usually comes when you're young. It's safer if you're infected when you're younger than old. Bacterial diseases is any type of disease caused by bacteria. Bacteria 's are a kind of microorganism, which are tiny forms of life that cannot see by easy only be seen with a microscope. The bacteria that cause disease are called pathogenic bacteria. Bacterial diseases happen when pathogenic bacteria inter the body and begin to reproduce and grow in tissues. Pathogenic bacteria may also emit toxins that damage the body. Common pathogenic bacteria and the types of bacterial diseases they cause include: Staphylococcus Aureus belongs to the extremely common bacteria of microflora of the skin and mucous membranes of the humans. These pathogens cause many infections, including superficial and deep purulent infections, poisoning, urinary tract infection etc. In the US, staphylococcus bacteria are supposed to be the leading cause of sepsis, postoperative wound and prosthesis infections. In addition, staphylococcus belongs to one of the leading causes of bacterial food poisoning. Staphylococcus Aureus is one of the most dangerous human pathogen. It is highly virulent with the high rate of resistance to the treatment and antimicrobial infectious agents. The mentioned above proves that the Epidemiology of Staph. Auerus as foodborne pathogen requires Central Idea: The three benefits about vaccination have preventing disease, vaccines are safe and functional ,and vaccines "}
