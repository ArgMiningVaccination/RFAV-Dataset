Executive Summary 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 1 I. Executive Summary Tax expenditures are legal mandates that provide preferential tax treatment to taxpayers that meet the requirements of the mandates. The 2016 Tax Expenditures Report contains information on 219 tax expenditure items enacted in the Rhode Island General Laws as of January 1, 2015. For tax expenditure items that did have reliable data from which to estimate revenue forgone, the estimated total revenue forgone was $ 1.83 billion in 2012 and $1.94 billion in 2013. The following table shows the number of tax expenditure items by tax expenditure category , the revenue forgone by tax expenditure category , and the average reliability index level by tax expenditure category for 2012: Summary Table by Tax Expenditure Category for 2012 Tax Expenditure Category Number of Items in Each Category Tax Year 201 2 Revenue Forgone1 Average Reliability Index Level Credits 29 $ 224,011,424 1.1 Deductions 23 205,650,183 3.0 Exclusions 27 55,796,654 4.3 Exemptions 97 1,321,515,144 3.6 Modifications 30 7,945,608 1.4 Other Items 7 --- 5.0 Preferential Tax Rates 2 16,371,130 3.0 Tax Abatement s 2 1,808,900 1.0 Tax Deferral s 2 --- 5.0 2012 TOTAL 219 $ 1,833,099,043 3.0 The tax expenditure category with the highest number of tax expenditure items in 2012 was Exemptions with 97.

Mixed fiscal year/tax year tax expenditure categories, the number of individual fiscal year items, the fiscal year revenue forgone amount, the number of individual tax year items and the tax year revenue forgone amount are: Exclusions, 25 for $41,298,707 and two for $14,497,947; Exemptions, 59 for $187,018,677 and 38 for $1,134,496,467; Modifications, one for $2,779,430 and 29 for $5,166,178; Other Items, seven for an indeterminable amount and zero; Preferential tax rates, one for $16,371,130 and one for an indeterminable amount; and Tax Abatements, one for $1,608,900 and one for $200,000. I. Executive Summary 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 2 forgone was Tax Abatements at $1,8 08,900 or 0.1 percent of the estimated total revenue forgone. The revenue forgone for each of the tax expenditure items is assigned a reliability index level on a scale of one to five, with one meaning the calculated revenue forgone is the most reliable possible and five meaning that it is not possible to calculate the revenue forgone for the tax expenditure item. A total of 76 or 34.7 percent of all 2012 tax expenditure items received a reliability index level score of one, wh ile 77 or 35.2 percent of the 219 tax expenditure items were assigned a reliability index score of five. The remaining 66 tax expenditure items were assigned a reliability index level score of two, three or four with 38 of the remaining 66 tax expenditure items receiving a reliability index level of three.

Several tax types had the smallest amount of revenue forgone at $0 for tax expenditure items for which revenue forgone could be determined. The largest amount of calculated revenue forgone for an individual tax expenditure item for 2013 is the s ales and use tax exemption for pur chases used for manufacturing purposes at nearly $350.5 million or 18.1 percent of the total calculated revenue forgone. This tax expenditure item was assigned a reliability index level of three. There were 96 tax expenditure items in total which had the smallest possible revenue forgone of $0 and all were assigned a reliability index level of one. II. Foreward 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 7 II. Foreword The 2016 Tax Expenditures Report generally uses data for 2012 as its base year and includes estimates o f forgone revenue for 2013 through 2017. The year reference can be either calendar year or fiscal year and is dependent on the tax expenditure item. For example, the tax expenditure amo unt for the exclusion of the biodiesel portion of a blended gallon of diesel fuel is reported on a fiscal year basis for 2012 through 2017 while the tax expenditure amount for the tax credit received for the provision of accommodations under Americans with Disabilities Act is reported on a calendar year basis for 2012 through 2017. The Office of Revenue Analysis (ORA) has tried to make it clear throughout the report when a tax expenditure amount is for a fiscal year versus a calendar year and when a summar y tax expenditure amount is provided by tax expenditure category or by tax type a note is provided that breaks out the tax expenditure amount by fiscal and calendar year. Whenever more recent data w as available for subsequent years, be it for fiscal years or tax years, the latest data was included in the report rather than an estimate. It should be noted that more recent data may have become available for some tax expenditure items during the preparation of this report, but is not reflected in this report . The 2014 Tax Expenditures Report included information on tax expenditure items for Tax Years 2010 through 2015, with Tax Year 2010 as its base tax year. Technically, the 2016 Tax Expenditures Report is mandated to provide information on all tax expendi ture items in effect on January 1, 2015, as well as an estimate o f forgone revenue for 2016 and 2017. In an attempt to provide a complete and more accurate picture for 2012 through 2014, ORA reported current data or an updated estimate of forgone revenue as appropriate . As always, constructive comments are welcome and any errors or omissions in the report are the responsibility of the Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis. Paul L. Dion, Ph.D. Chief, Office of Revenue Analysis Rhode Island Department of Revenue III. In troduction 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 8 III. Introduction Purpose of the Tax Expenditures Report The purpose of the Tax Expenditures Report is to provide information on the cost of tax preference items that are mandated under Rhode Island law, federal law, or other legal mandates. Tax expenditure items are not subject to the same public scrut iny as spending appropriations that are made through the budget process. Oftentimes the estimated cost of a tax expenditure item is made only once \u2014 at the time it is passed into law. The Tax Expenditures Report provides for an accounting of the cost of tax expenditure items on an ongoing basis. By providing this cost information, the Tax Expenditures Report allows these expenditures to be assessed on par with appropriated expenditures. Absent a Tax Expenditures Report it would be extremely difficult to assess the cost effectiveness of a tax expenditure vis -\u00e0-vis an appropriated expenditure. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes , tax expenditures are simply \"spending by another name.\" 5 Current Rhode Island Law on Tax Expenditures Reporting Rhode Island General Law Chapter 44- 48.1 - Tax Expenditure Reporting 6 Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44- 48.1- 1(a) mandates that the Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis deliver to the General Assembly by the second Tuesday in January of each even numbered year a tax expenditure report. The tax expenditure report must include the minimum information for 100.0 percent of the tax expenditures in place on January 1 of the odd numbered year preceding the report's publication. Thus, the 2016 Tax Expen ditures Report covers all of the tax expenditures that were in place on January 1, 2015. Rhode Island General Law s \u00a7 44- 48.1- 1(b) defines a tax expenditure as \"any tax credit, deduction, exemption, exclusion, credit preferential tax rate, tax abatement, a nd tax deferral that provides preferential treatment to selected taxpayers.\" The term \"credit preferential tax rate\" is not defined in the statute. The Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis has chosen to interpret this item to mean a \"modification\" or \"preferential tax rate\" and reports on each of these tax expenditure items separately. The Office of Revenue Analysis has determined that as of January 1, 201 5 there were 219 tax expenditure items in effect in 2012 7 either \"directly through Rhode Island general laws or constitutional provisions or indirectly through adoption of other tax codes.\" Rhode Island General Law s \u00a7 44 -48.1- 1(c) delineates the information on each tax expenditure item that must be included in the report. This information includes : (1) the 5 Levitis, Jason, Nicholas Johnson, and Jeremy Koulish, Promoting State Budget Accountability Through Tax Expenditure Rep orting. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: Washington, D.C., April 2009, page 5. 6 A full copy of the statute governing tax expenditure reporting is contained in Appendix A. 7 For 2013, the number of tax expenditure items increases to 224 primarily due to the addition of several tax expenditure items during the 2015 Session of the General Assembly. III. Introduction 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 9 legal reference of the tax expenditure items , \"including whether the tax expenditure is the result of a federal or state constitutional, judicial, or statutory mandate; \" (2) the actual amount of revenue forgone or an estimate for the calendar yea r in which the report is published and the year following the report's publication, and an index of the reliability of each estimate that ranges in value from one to five , with level one being the most reliable; (3) the identification of the beneficiaries of the tax expenditure by \"number, income, class and industry; \" (4) a comparison of the Rhode Island tax expenditure items to tax expenditure items of the other New England s tates, but particularly Connecticut and Massachusetts; (5) \"the data source(s) and analysis methodology\" for each tax expenditure item estimate; and (6) \"identification of similar taxpayers or industries\" that do not benefit from the tax expenditure item. To the greatest extent possible the Office of Revenue Analysis has tried to compl y with each of these informational mandates. Rhode Island General Law s \u00a7 44- 48.1- 1(d) requires that each report contain a section comprised of recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the tax expenditures r eport as a tax policy tool. The recommendations are to be accompanied with an identification of the resources needed to implement the recommendations and an estimate of the costs associated with the recommendations. Rhode Is land General Law Chapter 44- 48.2 - Rhode Island Economic Development Tax Incentives Evaluation Act of 20138 On July 11, 2013, Rhode Island General Law Chapter 44- 48.2 entitled the \"Rhode Island Economic Development Tax Incentives Evaluation Act of 2013\" was enacted into law. Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44- 48.2- 4(a) states that the Tax Expenditure Report produced pursuant to Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44- 48.1- 1 \"shall include an additional analysis component,... produced in consultation with the director of the economic development corporation, the director of the office of management and budget, and the director of the department of labor and training.\" A total of 21 tax expenditure economic development incentives are to be analyzed \"at least once between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2017, and no less than once every three (3) years thereafter\" while the analysis of any tax expenditure economic development incentives enacted into law after July 1, 2013 \"shall be completed within five (5) years of taking effect and no less than once every three (3) years thereafter\". The statutory references for the 21 tax expenditure economic development incentives are listed in Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44- 48.2-3(a)(1). The additional analysis component that must be included in the tax expenditure report for these tax expenditure e conomic development incentives is detailed in Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44 -48.2-5(a). To date, the Office of Revenue Analysis has been unable to fulfill its obligations under Rhode Island General Law Chapter 44- 48.2 and, as a result, the additional analy sis component mandated in Rhode Island General Law Section 44- 48.2- 5(a) for the tax expenditure economic development incentives listed in Rhode Island General Law Section 44-48.2- 3(a)(1) is not included in the 2016 Tax Expenditures Report. The Office of Revenue Analysis expects to produce a separate addendum to the 2016 Tax Expenditures Report containing the analysis required in Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44- 48.2- 5(a) for all 8 A full copy of the statute governing tax incentive evaluation is contained in Appendix B. III. Introduction 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 10 21 of the tax expenditure economic development incentives listed in Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44- 48.2- 3(a)(1) by the June 30, 2017 deadline noted in the previous paragraph. History of Rhode Island Law on Tax Expenditures Reporting Rhode Island's governing statute for tax expenditure reporting was passed into law without the Governor 's signature on August 9, 1996 (see Rhode Island Public Laws 1996, Chapter 327, Section 1 and Chapter 394, Section 1). This initial statute required the state tax administrator to submit annually to the General Assembly beginning in 1998, on or before the second Tuesday in January , \"to the extent possible within the appropriations provided for the purpose ,\" a tax expenditure s report. The tax expenditures report for 1998 was to provide the \"minimum information\" for 25.0 percent of existing tax expenditures . The report for 1999 would cover an additional 25.0 percent of the tax expenditures , so that 50.0 percent of tax expenditures will have been reported. Similar 25.0 percent increments were required for 2000 and 2001, such that by January 2001, 100.0 perc ent of tax expenditures will have been reported. Beginning in January 2002, the cycle repeated itself so that no report on a tax expenditure item was more than four years old. The definition of tax expenditure was the same as it is in current law as was the requirement for providing the legal reference of each tax expenditure, identifying the beneficiaries of each tax expenditure as well as similar taxpayers or industries that did not benefit from the tax expenditure, and comparing Rhode Island's tax expe nditure items to those of other New England states particularly Connecticut and Massachusetts. The original statute also required that the report include the legislative history of each tax expenditure, the \"determination of the beneficiary's state tax bu rden\" and a cost/benefit analysis of each tax expenditure item \"including the direct revenue loss from the tax expenditure as well as the economic and tax revenue gains occurring through the economic activity resulting from the tax expenditure.\" On June 25, 1997 (see Rhode Island Public Laws 1997, Chapter 30, Section 1) , the original statute was amended to delete the requirement of the inclusion of a cost/benefit analysis for each tax expenditure item in the tax expenditure report. On July 10, 2003, the s tatute was amended again to change the periodicity of the report from annually to biannually beginning in 2004. In addition, the rolling renewal of 25.0 percent of existing tax expenditures was changed to require that \"the minimum information on 100.0 per cent of tax expenditures in effect on January 1\" of the prior calendar year be reported. The requirement that the legislative history of a tax expenditure item be reported was eliminated leaving only the requirement that the legal reference for each tax expenditure item be reported. Further, the original statute was modified to require that an estimate of the revenue for gone that results from each tax expenditure item be reported if the actual amount cannot be determined and that such estimates be made fo r the calendar year preceding and following the year in which the report is published as well as the report's publication year. Additionally, the requirement that the beneficiary of tax expenditure item's state tax burden be determined was deleted and rep laced with the requirement that the data sources and analysis methodology underlying each estimate of revenue forgone be provided. Also, the amendment to the statute required each report to include \"a section containing recommendations for improving the e ffectiveness of the III. Introduction 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 11 report as a tax policy tool\" including the resources required and an estimate of the costs associated with these recommendations. Finally, the revision to the statute required the state tax administrator to \"make available to the Gener al Assembly a plan to improve Rhode Island's tax expenditure reporting effort\" by the second Tuesday in January 2004. On June 30, 2006, Rhode Island General Law Chapter 44 -48.1 was amended to shift the responsibility for the delivery of the tax expenditur e report from \"the state tax administrator, to the extent possible within the appropriations provided for the purpose\" to the Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis without regard to appropriations provided for that purpose. In addition, this amendment r equired the Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis to \"make available to the General Assembly a plan to improve Rhode Island's tax expenditure reporting effort\" by the second Tuesday in January 2004. This latter amendment could not be fulfilled given tha t the Office of Revenue Analysis was not created until June 2006. IV. Interpreting the Report 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 12 IV. Interpreting the Report The Index of Reliability Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44- 48.1- 1 (c)(2)9 requires the tax administrator to \" develop an index of the reliability of each estimate \" of revenue forgone . By statute, the index of reliability is based on a scale of one to five, \" with level one being most reliable. \" The statute further specifies that estimates of revenue forgone that are derived from actual tax returns \"should be assigned reliability level one,\" while those estimates of revenue forgone for which no reliable data exists \"should be assigned reliability level five. \" A perusal of previously published tax expenditures reports revealed that the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report was the first such report to provide such an index. The 2016 Tax Expenditures Report uses the reliability index that was developed in the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report . The Index of R eliability is shown b elow: Index of Reliability Interpretation Level One (1) Estimate is from actual Rhode Island tax return data Level Two (2) Estimate is extrapolated from Rhode Island source data Level Three (3) Estimate is from Rhode Island tax simulation model Level Four (4) Estimate is federal/national data scaled for Rhode Island Level Five (5) No reliable data exists from which to derive an estimate The end points of the Index of Reliability (i.e., Level One and Level Five) are consistent with their statutory mandates. An estimate of revenue forgone for a tax expenditure item that is assigned an Index of Reliability Level One will be based on actual Rhode Island tax return data. Given the fact that an Index of Reliability Level Five indicates that \" no reliable data exists from which to derive an estimate ,\" tax expenditure items assigned this level will not have an estimate of revenue forgone presented. Rather, the phrase \" no estimate possible \" will be presented next to the tax expenditure item. The In dex of Reliability Levels Two through Four requires some further explanation. An estimate of revenue forgone with an Index of Reliability Level Two is based on data that can be directly sourced to Rhode Island or an update of a previously derived estimate of the tax expenditure item. Some examples of data that can be directly sourced to Rhode Island include data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. In addition, state government agencies, quasi -public agencies, and non -governmental organizations are able to provide reliable Rhode Island specific data from which to estimate the revenue forgone of a tax expenditure item. In the case of updating a previously derived estimate , the o riginal estimate may be from a previously published tax expenditures report, a fiscal note that was completed for a particular piece of legislation during a session of the General Assembly, 9 A full copy of the statute governing tax expenditure reporting is contained in Appendix A. IV. Interpreting the Report 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 13 or an estimate that was derived by the Budget Office, the Division of Taxation, the Office of Revenue Analysis or some other state agency for a purpose other than that of the tax expenditures report. When an Index of Reliability Level Two is assigned to the revenue forgone estimate of a tax expenditure item, the source of the Rhode Island data will be specified. An estimate of revenue forgone for a tax expenditure item with an Index of Reliability Level Three is derived from a micro simulation model of a particular tax that has been developed and provided by a third party vendor. In some cases such a micro simulation model will generate estimates based on underlying Rhode Island economic data rather than actual tax data. The most obvious example of this type of micro simulation model is the Rhode Island Micro Sales Tax Model that was purchased by the General Assembly in 2008 and made availabl e to the Office of Revenue Analysis for the purpose of estimating the revenue impacts from changing sales tax rates, sales tax exemptions, and/or the sales tax base. This model is used extensively to estimate the revenue forgone from the numerous transact ions that are exempt from the State 's sales and use tax. Finally, an estimate of revenue forgone for a tax expenditure item with an Index of Reliability Level Four is based on federal / national data that is scaled to Rhode Island. Alternatively, the est imate may be based on federal data that is then adjusted by a factor that allows for the extrapolation of the federal data to Rhode Island. When an Index of Reliability Level Four is assigned to the revenue forgone estimate of a tax expenditure item, the date on which the original estimate was derived will be stated if it is known as will the method used to update the original estimate. In the case of an estimate that is based on federal data that is scaled to Rhode Island, the base federal data will be i dentified as will the scaling factor. Structure of the Report Previous tax expenditures reports presented tax expenditure items by tax type. In other words, the primary organizing key was tax type with tax expenditure items appearing under each tax type. For example, in the Tax Expenditures Report, January 2008, thirty -eight tax expenditure items are listed under the heading \" Personal Income \" and these tax expenditure items are comprised of modifications, credits, exclusions, adjustments, deductions and preferential tax rates. 10 In addition, when it comes to tax expenditure items, it is often the case that what is available for one tax type will also be made available for other tax types. For example, the Motion Picture Production Tax Credit allows for a credit of 25.0 percent \" of the state certified production costs incurred directly attributable to activity within the state, provided that the primary locations are within the state of Rhode Island and the total production budget as defined herein is a m inimum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).\" 11 This credit, which can be transferred or sold, can be used against the \" tax imposed \" under the state 's business corporation tax, financial institutions 10 State of Rhode Island, Department of Revenue, Division of Taxation, Tax Expenditures Report, January 2008, p. 3. This report was prepared by Cecilia C. Vallee, Revenue Analyst, at the request of David M. Sullivan, Rhode Isl and Tax Administrator. 11 See Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44 -31.2- 5 (a). IV. Interpreting the Report 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 14 tax, insurance companies gross premiums tax, and t he personal income tax. As a result of this type of tax expenditure, tax expenditures report issued prior to the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report had to include a category labeled \"Tax Preference Items Applicable to More Than One Tax \"12 in order to consistentl y categorize tax expenditure items. In the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report , the Office of Revenue Analysis adopted a different presentation format. Rather than list the tax expenditure items by the tax type to which they apply, the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report used the category of tax expenditure item as the organizing key. That is, each category of tax expenditure item s listed each individual tax expenditure item and the tax types to which the individual tax expenditure item applies. For example, the Moti on Picture Production Tax Credit would be categorized under \"Credits \" with the business corporation tax, financial institutions tax, insurance companies gross premiums tax, and the personal income tax as the relevant tax types. The 2016 Tax Expenditures R eport follows the same approach as was adopted for the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report . To assist readers in the use of the 2016 Tax Expenditures Report , two sets of summary tables are included. The first set of summary tables lists the value of tax expenditures by tax expenditure item. Thus, for example, under the category \"Credits \" the total value of each individual tax expenditure credit item, without regard to the tax type under which it was used , will be shown. The second set of summary tables lists the value of tax expenditures by tax type. Thus, for example, under the tax type \"Personal Income \" the total value of each individual tax expenditure item that is used under the personal income tax will be displayed. Definition of Terms The following definitions will be used when referring to the different types of tax expenditure items included in this report. Credit : The direct dollar -for-dollar reduction of an individual 's tax liability . The value of a tax credit is invariant to a taxpayer 's tax bracket. Deduction: An amount subtracted from adjusted gross income when calculating taxable income . The value of a tax deduction is proportional to a taxpayer 's tax bracket. Exclusion: An amount or proportion that can be legally excluded from the taxable base prior to the assessment of tax. Exemption : A taxable expenditure , income , or investment on which no tax is levied. A tax exemption may be of li mited or permanent duration. Modification : An amount added to or subtracted from gross income to arrive at adjusted gross income. Usually, adjusted gross income is the basis from which taxable income is derived. 12 See Tax Expenditures Report, January 2008, p. 144. IV. Interpreting the Report 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 15 Preferential Tax Rate: A tax rate made av ailable to certain taxpayers that is less than the statutory tax rate. Typically, the preferential tax rate is made available to taxpayer s that meets specified criteria. Tax Abatement : Rebate given in levies or taxes under special circumstances or as an offset to the performance of particular actions. Tax Deferral : Paying taxes in the future for income earned in the current year, such as through an Individual Retirement A ccount (IRA), 401(k), Simplified Employee Pens ion (SEP) IRA or Keogh plan. Categorization of Tax Expenditure Items The tables on the following pages show the categorization of tax expenditure items and to which taxes each tax expenditure item appl ies. The individual tax expenditure items are listed alphabetically and those tax expenditure items that originate in the federal Internal Revenue Code are so indicated. Italicized tax expenditure items and indicatory (\"X\") represent tax expenditure items that were in effect in Tax Year 2010 or earlier, bu t were eliminated for use as of January 1, 2015. IV.

For a defined -contribution Keogh or SEP plan, the deduction is limited to 25.0 percent of the compensation paid to the emplo yee(s) that are participating in the plan or a specific dollar limit, whichever is less. For tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014, the dollar limit is $50,000, $51,000, and $52,000, respectively. For tax years 2015 and 2016, the dollar limit is $53,000.

A net operating loss is apportioned in the year incurred according to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 77-A:3. T he law does not allow for the carry -back of losses in any instance. New Hampshire uses 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 172 that was in effect on December 31, 1996 except for the requirement to carry back the loss and the limitation to carry forward for 10 years following the loss year. The net operating loss must be apportioned in the year the loss is incurred and is also a deduction before apportionment in the year deducted. New Hampshire Statute: N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 77- A:4, XIII Vermont : Effective for tax years begi nning on and after January 1, 2007, Vermont enacted a \"stand -alone\" net operating loss deduction, in place of the federal net operating loss deduction, by defining \"Vermont net operating loss\" (VNOL) as any negative income after allocation and apportionment of Vermont net income.

(4) There is value in expanding the arts district program statewide, providing incentives for the sale and purchase of art. This is a unique opportunity for Rhode Island to shape history, and gain an advantage over other states, by becoming the first and only state in the country to declare a statewide sales tax exemption on art.

Bonus Depreciation Provided by JCWAA of 2002 and JGTRRA of 2003: Statutory Reference: Rhode Island General Law Section 44- 61-1 Stated Purpose : No stated purpose given in law. Year Enacted / Year Amended : 2002 / 2008 Description : For purposes of depreciating assets under Rhode Island General Law Chapters 44- 11, 44- 14 and 44- 30, the bonus depreciation provided by the federal Job Creation and Workers Assistance Act (JCWAA) of 2002 and the federal Jobs Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) of 2003, or any subsequent enactment for federal tax purposes , is not allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes. In the year those assets are pl aced in service and in all subsequent years, depreciation for Rhode Island tax purposes is allowed as it would have been computed prior to the enactment of the JCWAA of 2002. The JCWAA of 2002 allowed a special 30.0 percent bonus depreciation deduction in the first year for qualifying property purchased after September 10, 2001, and before September 11, 2004, for purposes of computing federal net income. In addition, the JCWAA of 2002 modified Internal Revenue Code Section 168(k) to allow taxpayers to claim an additional first- year bonus depreciation allowance on any new Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) property when the recovery period is 20 years or less. The additional depreciation allowance is equal to 30.0 percent of the adjusted cost basis of the property after any Internal Revenue Code Section 179 expense deductions are taken. The JGTRRA of 2003 increased the bonus depreciation deduction from 30.0 percent to 50.0 percent for assets purchased after May 5, 2003, but before January 1, 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 extended some bonus depreciation rules for certain aircraft as well as other items. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 reintroduced bonus depreciation of 50.0 percent for qualifying property placed in service in tax year 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the 50.0 percent bonus depreciation for qualifying property placed in service in tax year 2009. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 increased the bonus depre ciation from 50.0 percent to 100.0 percent for qualifying property acquired and placed in service after September 8, 2010, but before January 1, 2012. Qualifying property acquired on or before September 8, 2010 is eligible for the 50.0 percent bonus depre ciation , provided that it was placed in service prior to January 1, 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extend s the 50.0 percent bonus depreciation for qualif ying property placed in service in tax year 2013. Rhode Island's disallowance of bonus depreciation is a timing issue. In the year that an asset is put in service and is eligible for the federal bonus depreciation, a Rhode Island taxpayer must take as a modification increasing federal adjusted gross income (federal AGI) the difference in the bonus depreciation amount allowed on the federal tax return and the depreciation amount allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes. In subsequent years, a Rhode Island taxpayer may take as a modification decreasing federal AGI the difference in the depreci ation amount allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes and the depreciation amount allowed on the federal tax return. At the end of the asset's \"useful\" life, the same VIII. Tax Expenditure Items - Modifications 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 359 amount of depreciation will be realized by the taxpayer on both the federal and the Rhode Island tax returns. Thus, over the life of the asset, there is no net impact on Rhode Island tax collections. Data Source: Business Corporations Tax : TY 201 2 and TY 2013 Statistics of Corporate Income - C Returns Only, Rhode Island Division of Taxation.

For TY 2012, the total net modification resulted in an increas e to federal taxable income; therefore, there is no revenue forgone from this modification in TY 2012. For TY 2013, an apportionment factor of 0.39976112 percent, supplied by the Division of Taxation, was applied to the net decreasing modification reporte d. The amount of revenue forgone is derived by multiplying the apportioned decreasing modification for bonus depreciation and enhanced Section 179 expensing by the business corporations tax rate of 9.0 percent.

Expensing of Assets in Lieu of Depreciation, Section 179 of Internal Revenue Code: Statutory Reference: Rhode Island General Law Section 44- 61-1.1 Stated Purpose : No stated purpose given in law. Year Enacted / Year Amended : 2003 / 2013 Description : Beginning on or after January 1, 2014, f or purposes of the expensing of assets under Rhode Island General Law Chapters 44- 11, 44- 14 and 44- 30, the expense deduction for Rhode Island tax purposes shall be allowed in the same manner as is provided for under Section 179 of the IRC.

Tax Expenditure Items - Modifications 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 372 Prior to January 1, 2014, the expense deduction could not exceed $25,000 in any taxable year. The additional expensing of assets under Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provided by the federal Jobs Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) , or any subsequent enactment for federal tax purposes , was not allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes. In the year assets we re placed in service and in all subsequent years, expenses and depreciation for Rhode Island tax purposes were allowed on those assets as it would have been computed prior to the enactment of the JGTRRA. The expense deduction limitation of $25,000 applie d to tax years beginning January 1, 2007 and ending December 31, 2013. Prior to the JGTRRA, businesses could expense up to $25,000 under Section 179 of the IRC. The amount that could be e xpensed was reduced on a dollar -for-dollar basis by the amount by which the cost of qualifying property exceeded $200,000. Therefore, capital investments over $225,000 did not qualify. The JGTRRA increased the maximum amount of expensing to $100,000 and the phase -out to $400,000, allowing purchases of qualifying property up to $500,000 in cost to qualify. These limits were indexed for inflation for tax years beginning after 2003. JGTRRA applied to tax years 2003 through 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 extended the JGTRRA 's provisions to tax years 2006 and 2007 and added off -the-shelf computer software to the list of qualifying property. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 extended the increased expensing for small bu sinesses under JGTRRA to tax years 2008 and 2009. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 increased the maximum amount of expensing to $250,000 and the phase -out amount to $800,000 for tax year 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the provisions of the ESA to tax year 2009. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 increased the Section 179 limitations on expensing of depreciable business assets for tax years beginning in 2010 and 2011 to $500,000 per item and $2.0 million overall. In addition, the SBJA temporarily expanded the types of property that qualified for Section 179 expensing to include certain qualified real property. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended the Section 179 limitations in effect for tax years 2010 and 2011 to tax years 2012 and 2013. As of March 31, 2016, the federal Section 179 expensing rules for tax year 2015 revert back to $250,000 of immediate expensing subject to a maximum capital expense of $500,000. Rhode Island's disallowance of the increas ed expense deduction under Section 179 is a timing issue. In the year that an asset is placed in service and is eligible for the federal increased expense deduction, a Rhode Island taxpayer must take as a modification increasing federal adjusted gross income (federal AGI) the difference in the increased expense deduction amount allowed on the federal tax return and the expense deduction amount allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes which is a maximum of $25,000. In subsequent years, a Rhode Island taxpayer may take as a modification decreasing federal AGI the expense deduction amount that was disallowed for Rhode Island tax purposes but allowed for federal tax purposes and the expense deduction amount allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes up to a maximum of $25,000. This modification reducing federal AGI is taken until the expense deduction amount that was disallowed for Rhode Island tax VIII.

Law Comparison: Maine , Massachusetts and New Hampshire have similar provisions. Maine: Maine's tax laws require the federal adjusted gross income or the federal net income of a taxpayer, for tax years beginning on or after Janua ry 1, 2003 but prior to January 1, 2011, to be increased with respect to property placed in service during the taxable year by an amount equal to the net increase in expensing attributable to the increase in aggregate cost under Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) arising from amendments to the IRC applicable to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2003. Maine's tax law requires that the federal adjusted gross income or federal net income of the taxpayer be decreased by a fraction of any amount previously added back by the taxpayer to federal adjusted gross income . In the case of property expensed pursuant to Section 179 of the IRC, the term \"recovery period\" means the recovery period that would have been applicable to the property had S ection 179 not been applied. In 2011, the Maine legislature enacted full conformity with federal Section 179 expense thresholds for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. Maine Statute: Me. Rev. Stat.

In 2004, the ETIEA was also ruled an illegal trading subsidy by the WTO. In 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 repealed the federal laws governing FSCs and the exclusion of extra -territorial income. VIII.

IX. Recommendations for Improving the Report 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 447 IX. Recommendations for Improving the Report The Tax Expenditures Report's effectiveness as a tax policy tool is dependent on the report's users' background, knowledge of state tax law and ability to understand the process by which estimates have been derived by the Office of Revenue Analysis. Although 43.9 percent of the tax expenditure items for which reliable data existed in TY 2013 were assigned a reliability level index of \"1 ,\" meaning the source of the derived estimate was actual tax returns, ideally 100.0 percent of the derived estimates for tax expenditure items f or which reliable data exists should have as a source actual tax returns. The primary tax type for which actual tax return data does not exist and thus estimates of forgone revenue must be derived vi a less reliable methods is the s ales and use tax. Given that the sales and use t ax is the second largest source of state general revenue and that it also is the tax type for w hich the greatest amount of for gone revenue was estimated at $1,250,954,859 in TY 2013, the Office of Revenue Analysis finds that the quality and quantity of data collected for the sales and use t ax needs to be improved for there to be an increase in the reliability of the for gone revenue estimates for the sales and u se tax. The Division of Taxation is currently changing the tax ret urn re conciliation process for sales and use t ax filers requiring that more information on exempt sales be provided on the return with the frequency of reporting being reduced from quarterly to twice a year. Sal es and use taxpayers who are currently required to file their monthly returns electronically would also be required to file their twice a year reconciliations electronically. In addition, the quanti ty and quality of data for the business corporations t ax is lacking. The business corporations t ax, common ly referred to as the corporate income tax, is the tax type with the third largest amount of estimated forgone revenue due to tax expenditure items at $80,769,493 in TY 2013, but has the largest percentage of tax expenditures items at 39.3 percent for whic h no reliable data exists from w hich to derive estimates of for gone revenue. 13 This compares to 7.5 percent of tax expenditure items for which no reliable data exists for the personal income t ax and 35.3 percent of tax expenditure items for which no reliab le data exists for the sales and use t ax. The Office of Revenue Analysis finds that the quality and quantity of data collected for the business c orporations tax needs to be improved for there to be an increas e in the reliability of the for gone revenue est imates for the business corporations tax. Fortunately, most of the data that would improve the reporting of business corporations tax expenditure items is already reported on the taxpayers' tax returns and the crux of the issue in this regard is capturing the relevant data from these returns. The Division of Taxation is in the process of requiring most business corporations taxpayers to file their tax returns electronically allowing for the capture of more data. In the FY 2012 Capital Budget, the Division of Taxation requested $25.0 million over the FY 2012 - FY 2016 period to finance the development of an integrated tax system. The development of the integrated tax system is well underway and is expected to be completed 13 It should be noted that in the 2014 Tax Expenditures Report , the same metric was 58.3 percent so there has been improvement in thi s regard. IX. Recommendations for Improving the Report 2016 Rhode Island Tax Expenditures Report 448 by FY 2017. The Office of Revenue Analysis expects that once the integrated tax system is in place and fully functioning more data on tax expenditure items will become available and be disclosed in this report. Finally, the Office of Revenue Analysis needs to more directly take into account the definition of a tax expenditure as it is provided for in Rhode Island General Law Chapter 44-48.1. The statute defines a \"tax expenditure\" as \"any tax credit, deduction, exemption, exclusion, credit preferential tax rate, tax abatement, and tax d eferral that provides preferential treatment to selected taxpayers, whether directly through Rhode Island general laws or constitutional provisions or indirectly through adoption of other tax codes .\" To date, the Office of Revenue Analysis, following prec edent set by the Division of Taxation when it was responsible for producing the Tax Expenditures Report, has reported on all tax expenditure contained in state and federal law. It is not clear that every tax expenditure included in the biennial Tax Expenditures Report \"provides preferential treatment to selected taxpayers\" and, if not, those tax expenditures should be excluded from the report on a going forward basis.

(a) On or before the second Tuesday in January of each even numbered year beginning in 2004, the chief of the office of revenue analysis, shall deliver a tax expenditure report to the general assembly. Each report will provide the minimum information for one hundred percent (100%) of tax expenditures in effect on January 1 of the calendar year preceding the report's publication. (b) For t he purposes of this section, a \" tax expenditure\" is any tax credit, deduction, exemption, exclusion, credit preferential tax rate, tax abatement, and tax deferral that provides preferential treatment to selected taxpayers, whether directly through Rhode Island general laws or constitutional provisions or indirectly through adoption of other tax codes. (c) The information included for each tax expenditure shall include, but shall not be limited to: (1) The legal reference of the expenditures, including information whether the expenditure is required as a result of federal or state constitutional, judicial, or statutory mandate. (2) Amount of revenues forgone or an estimate, if the actual amount cannot be determined, for the calendar year immediately preceding the publication of the report. The rep ort shall also include an estimate of revenue forgone for the calendar year in which the report is published and the year following the report's publication. The tax administrator shall develop an index of the reliability of each estimate using five (5) levels with level one being most reliable. Where actual tax returns are the source of the estimate, the estimate should be assigned reliability level one. Where no reliable data exists for the estimate, the estimate should be assigned reliability level five (5). The reliability level shall be reported for the estimate of the revenues forgone. (3) To the extent allowable by law, identification of the beneficiaries of the exemption by number, income, class and industry. (4) A comparison of the tax expendi ture to the tax systems of the other New England states, with emphasis on Massachusetts and Connecticut.

(6) To the extent allowable by law, identification of similar taxpayers or industries that do not enjoy the exemption. (d) Each report shall include a section containing recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the report as a tax policy tool. This section shall identify the resources required to implement these recommendations and shall also contain an estimate of the costs associated with such recommendations. (e) On or before the second Tuesday in January 2004, the chief of the office of revenue analysis shall make available to the general assembly a plan to improve Rhode Island 's tax expenditure reporting effor t. The plan shall include measurable criteria to evaluate improvements in the reliability of tax expenditure item estimates and the identification of beneficiaries of each tax expenditure item by number, income, class and industry. The plan shall also in clude cost estimates of additional resources necessary to implement the plan, and may include any other information that the tax administrator deems appropri ate for inclusion in said plan.
