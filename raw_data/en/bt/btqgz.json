If you're on TikTok, you've probably heard about skin cycling, the latest viral beauty trend that calls for alternating the products in your [nighttime skincare routine](https://www.oprahdaily.com/beauty/a40919403/skincare-routine-steps/). Have you stared into your medicine cabinet and wondered how many exfoliating acids are too many? Have you compared ingredient labels, contemplating whether you should layer their contents? If so, then this method is for you. Skin cycling has you switch out active ingredients so you avoid over-exfoliation and potential irritation. \"There's so much confusion surrounding how to layer active ingredients and how often to use potentially irritating products like exfoliating serums,\" says [Whitney Bowe, M.D](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1583755&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrwhitneybowebeauty.com%2F)., the board-certified dermatologist who coined the term skin cycling. \"Skin cycling encourages you to use products strategically to complement one another rather than adding more products on top of one another.\" The method highlights a \"less is more\" approach by simplifying your routine and promoting a strong skin barrier. Keep reading to learn more about skin cycling, including how to customize it for your skin type and which products to use. What is skin cycling? Skin cycling encourages you to space out the active ingredients in your routine to give your skin time to adjust and heal from any potential irritation. While Bowe was the one to give skin cycling its catchy, viral name, many dermatologists have utilized this method for decades, says [Azadeh Shirazi](https://www.instagram.com/skinbydrazi/?hl=en), MD, a board-certified dermatologist. \"It simplifies fundamental skincare principles into a four-day cycle alternating between active ingredient nights and recovery nights,\" she explains. The four-day cycle kicks off with exfoliation on night one. Bowe recommends using a leave-on product formulated with chemical acids because it's more effective and gentle on the skin than physical scrubs. On night two, you apply [retinol](https://www.oprahdaily.com/beauty/g28661550/best-retinol-serums/), a powerhouse ingredient that stimulates cellular turnover to reduce signs of aging, dark spots, and acne. Days three and four are recovery nights: Skip active ingredients (exfoliants and retinols) and focus on nourishing and moisturizing skin, Shirazi explains. Use serums and creams that contain hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and/or ceramides. Then it's time to repeat the cycle. Bowe compares skin cycling to going to the gym. \"If you're trying to build strength in a particular muscle group, you don't load those muscles every day with heavy weights, because that leads to injury, not strength. The same is true for skin,\" she explains. \"By cycling through active ingredients and building in recovery nights that focus on repairing your skin barrier, skin cycling makes your products work smarter and harder for you.\" What are the benefits of skin cycling? People tend to think that more product steps, more exfoliation, and more treatments will yield better results. However, overdoing it leads to sensitized skin that's angry, irritated, and dry, says [Christina Lee Chung](https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/christina-lee-chung-md-faad/), MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in Philadelphia. Skin cycling limits the chance for irritation; it gives your skin's barrier time to rest and heal between active treatments, she says. Skin cycling also offers flexibility and customization, Bowe adds. \"If you're experiencing sensitivity and irritation, you can increase your recovery nights.\" For those who tolerate active ingredients well, replace a recovery night with a retinol or exfoliation night. You can modify the framework depending on your skin's needs, but the four-day cycle is a solid guideline you can always reference. How to do skin cycling for your skin type The good news is everyone can do skin cycling, no matter their skin type or knowledge of skincare. If you're establishing a routine, this method is a great starting point to help you understand how products affect your skin, Bowe says.

Or if you're a skincare veteran but feel like your old routine isn't giving you the best results, you might be pleasantly how the skin cycling technique can improve your outcome. Dry and Mature Skin Dry skin types might need more recovery days than oily types. Instead of two days of recovery, you may want to do three. Be cautious of ingredients that might over-strip the skin. \"Skin that's easily irritated, prone to dryness, or is mature requires products with lower concentrations of retinoids or chemical exfoliants,\" says Chung. If you find that even low levels of these ingredients are too harsh, she suggests using niacinamide and vitamin C as alternatives. Oily and Acne-Prone Skin While skin cycling only requires exfoliating once a night, oily and acne-prone skin types can be the exception to the rule, says Bowe. \"If you use an exfoliating product every day without irritation, then you might be someone who has oily, acne-prone skin,\" she says. \"I find that some of these patients benefit from a salicylic acid toner every morning (think: [La Roche-Posay Effaclar Clarifying Solution](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LO2RO7K)) to keep oiliness at bay and can still do skin cycling at night using a more powerful blend of exfoliating acid.\" Bowe recommends a leave-on exfoliant that contains glycolic acid.
