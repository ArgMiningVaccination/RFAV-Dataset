Part 1 of her answers is [ here](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/booming/answers-about-rheumatoid-arthritis-part-1.html). Dr. Bykerk, a rheumatologist who has practiced for more than 20 years, is the director of research at the Inflammatory Arthritis Center at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan and a researcher at Weill Cornell Medical College. Her focus is the [early detection](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21885485) of rheumatoid arthritis and the adoption of optimal treatment strategies. She was chairwoman of the Therapeutics Committee of the Canadian Rheumatology Association for four years and was the lead author of Canada's rheumatoid arthritis treatment recommendations. Dr. Bykerk is currently working in collaboration with the Inflammatory Arthritis Center to develop a clinical research program in early rheumatoid arthritis. Because of the volume of questions, not all may be answered. The final part of Dr. Bykerk's answers will appear next week on Booming. This feature is now closed to new questions. 'NATURAL' REMEDIES Q. I do not want to take any medication; I want to treat my R.A. by natural means. I don't believe that supporting the pharmaceutical industry and popping a pill with significant side effects is the answer to anything. I am curious to know what alternative treatments physicians will be recommending to their patients. I know there are many effective ways to treat this without chemicals. Thank you. \u2014 Deb, Los Angeles A. Deb, you are one of many who has concerns about adding chemicals to the body to treat R.A. and rightfully so. People are exposed to chemicals every day (on the road, in their food, in cleaning products, in the products they use to wash) and the impact is often unknown. Ideally, a natural approach (reducing stress, eating a well-balanced, more diverse plant based diet, getting a good night's sleep, doing light exercise \u2014 especially in water as this limits strain on joints) can be adopted by all and will have a positive impact on the disease. Practitioners of integrative care often focus on improving health by improving diet, and eliminating foods that are not nourishing and adding those that are. These may come under the category of \"cleanse.\" They also frequently focus on trying to reduce stress and improve energy (by recommending meditation, yoga, etc). I would caution the natural approach from herbalists as these also contain chemicals\u2014 you just don't know what they are or if they have undergone quality control. It is still best to keep a dialogue with your doctor going if this is your approach. At minimum most rheumatologists want to make sure nothing you are doing is causing any harm. Having said all this, be careful. R.A. can be a very severe disease that can have very serious consequences, including irreversible damage to the joints, early heart attacks, and can affect many parts of the body. Once damage starts to occur it becomes very difficult to control this disease. Sometimes a short course of a medically recommended therapy to get you into remission quickly with an attempt to wean down the therapy once the disease is in remission (while starting to use natural means) may achieve more than trying natural means alone. [Last week](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/booming/answers-about-rheumatoid-arthritis-part-1.html), a reader, Darci, described exactly this approach, starting a therapy, getting in remission while starting a vegan diet. More than likely both have helped, though we don't know how much a vegan diet contributes to the reduction of inflammation. Be particularly cautious if your doctor has identified factors that indicate your R.A. could be severe. These might include a high number of swollen and tender joints, blood tests including a positive rheumatoid factor, anti CCP antibody, high inflammation markers like C-reactive protein or evidence of damage (what rheumatologists call erosions) on imaging tests such as X-rays or ultrasound of the joints. If you have bad prognostic signs associated with your R.A., you should discuss with your rheumatologist the best combined approach to managing the disease. Q. I'm glad you're in remission, but it's incredibly rude and dangerous to take your n=1 experience and advise all other R.A. sufferers out there to follow your Chinese herbal remedies. Don't you understand that people are affected differently by R.A. and that it actually kills people when they are untreated? Do you lack any imagination whatsoever that renders you incapable of recognizing that what's going on in your body isn't what's happening in someone else's? You obviously don't have a very aggressive form of R.A. I wasted years and thousands of dollars on alternative, unproven, garbage and have only permanent joint and kidney damage to show for it. The amount of pressure from friends to try that junk is unbelievable. What I should have done was started on Enbrel a year earlier like my doctor told me to. I am so tired of the herbal/alternative/yoga/Chinese medicine crowd feeling such little compassion for ill people that they would have them forego medical treatment to boost up their superstitious health beliefs. It seems so good and leftist, but it's no better than others insisting prayer can cure cancer. I don't even understand why they would accept a diagnosis of R.A., something that only exists in the Western medical paradigm, when they believe so much in their roots and charms and gurus. Some adjuvant therapy can bring great relief and comfort, but none of it is going to cure R.A. or protect joints and organs from real, life-threatening damage. \u2014 Hattie, Seattle A. Hattie, thank you for reinforcing what the downside is of heading for the \"natural route.\" So many people with R.A. have had exactly your experience. I can't emphasize enough the importance of continuing to discuss with a rheumatologist what you are wanting and or doing to help manage your R.A. More important, people with R.A. need to be assessed often by a rheumatologist to understand what their risks and prognosis are with any approach to treating this disease. R.A. is not just arthritis! This is a disease with serious consequences and the treatment needs to be appropriate to the severity or potential severity of this disease. Q. Hi. I am 46, have early signs of R.A. and a diagnosis from a doctor, but have not returned to the doctor for drug treatment. I have found that by changing my lifestyle, exercising hard for one hour, three times a week, and increasing the exercise when my joints hurt, I can make the inflammation go away. I have found that I don't need to exercise the affected joints, just my body and heart, so if my knees hurt I swim and if my hands hurt I jog. A few years ago my knees and feet were so swollen I couldn't walk to the letterbox, but I have received help to strengthen the muscles supporting my joints from a professional trainer and I am training toward climbing a small mountain this spring. There is lots of help out there and I encourage others to consider exercise. Plus losing weight makes a big difference. My question is, will exercise continue to help and at what stage should I consider returning to the doctor for medication? I don't anticipate being in the early stages forever. Thanks so much for your time in answering questions. \u2014 Arlene, New Zealand A. Arlene, if you truly have R.A. and it is persisting you need to be in close touch with your rheumatologist to consider ways to best treat this disease. Exercise is really important and has many good health consequences when done right as does loss of excess weight. Neither will cure R.A. You do not want to miss the boat in getting into remission. Generally speaking the earlier R.A. is effectively treated the less we need to use \"the big guns.\" That is to say it is easier to treat R.A. with milder medications earlier and even achieve drug-free remission. Longer disease duration, as well as smoking, certain genetics and blood tests as discussed earlier make it more difficult to manage this disease. DIAGNOSTIC PROBLEMS Q. In the years since my R.A. diagnosis, I have seen five rheumatologists, none of whom have shown any interest in addressing the extra-articular manifestations of the disease. To them, it is all about the joints. Yet PCPs seem to just want to tell us patients that we should have our rheumatologists address these symptoms. What is a patient to do in this case? \u2014 Gwyn, New York A. Gwyn raises the important issue of extra-articular manifestations. These can include lung disease which is relatively uncommon, carpal tunnel syndrome which often improves when the disease is under good control, secondary Sjogren's syndrome (dry mouth and eyes), and early risk of heart disease, especially risk of heart attack. Continued discussion and questions to your rheumatologist around this issue is important. Most rheumatologists are thinking about this as they ask you questions about your general health. If you have a specific concern, however, you should bring it up. For instance, if you have a new cough or trouble with breathing, ask if this could be because of your R.A.? Either your rheumatologist or your primary care should be monitoring your lipid status and helping to modify any risks for heart disease. This includes stopping smoking which is generally detrimental for R.A. Q. What is the link between hemachromatosis and R.A.? Should someonewith an R.A. diagnosis be routinely tested for the condition? \u2014 hillynelson, Canterbury, N.H. A. People with hemachromatosis can present clinically looking as if they have R.A., but there is no link between the two and R.A. patients do not need to be routinely screened for this condition. Q. A word of warning: always get a second opinion! My fianc\u00e9 was given a diagnosis of R.A. last year but after six months of taking prednisone, methotrexate and Enbrel his condition only worsened. He finally ended up in severe pain at a large teaching hospital where a correct diagnosis was made: multiple myeloma, cancer of the plasma cells. He will undergo a stem-cell transplant at the end of August. I've since read that multiple myeloma symptoms can mimic R.A. \u2014 Julia, Wisconsin A. Julia highlights the importance of needing to consider many conditions when considering a diagnosis of R.A. and reconsidering the diagnosis if usual approaches to treatment don't work. There are mimics of this disease, most of which tend to be rare. Your fianc\u00e9's disease presentation sounds very unusual. The new diagnostic algorithms try to take this line of thinking into account. A diagnosis of R.A. is not meant to be not made until other conditions are ruled out and blood tests for R.A. are tested. I cannot attest to why this diagnosis was missed for your fianc\u00e9. It is possible that the myeloma presentation was very unusual and not identifiable by usual screening for immune diseases when testing for what appeared to be an inflammatory arthritis. Q. Dr. Bykerk, R.A. runs in my family in Eastern Europe. I am now in my mid-30s. Anything at all I can do to slow the onset of R.A. for myself? Thank you. \u2014 Student, Pa. A. Your actual risk for developing R.A. is unknown but probably somewhat elevated. You should be tested for R.A. and if you have joint symptoms see a rheumatologist. Q. What if any relationship is there between R.A. and G.I. disorders? \u2014 Sonya, Toronto, Ontario A. You have already read that many are interested in gut health and R.A. In particular people are interested in the gut bacteria (microbiome) and R.A. Inflammatory bowel disease can cause inflammatory arthritis but it is different from classical R.A. Nonetheless the types of arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease can be and often are just as serious. Some of these include ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis. We term these kinds of arthritis spondyloparthropathies and they can be associated with G.I. inflammatory disorders.
