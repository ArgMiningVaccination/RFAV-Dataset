There is degeneration in the lower spine; L4-L5 discs. Some scoliosis is present. The back became problematic twelve years ago. I truly believe that it was because of your treatments that I was able to make it through both the fall and winter without any back incidents. I travel twenty-five miles to be treated, and consider it well worth it. Results are due to your expert technique in acupuncture. I find you knowledgeable, informative, and patient with any questions asked. I feel well cared for and confident that I am receiving the gold-standard in acupuncture care. -Art (Rockford, IL) Already visited "}
