Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make coverage determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and coverage determinations do not apply to those clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan docum ent] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based. For example, a custo mer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supersedes the information in the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a c ontrolling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment and have discretion in making individual coverage determinations. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other coverage determinations.

Bone marrow produces all of the different cells that make up the blood, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. All of the cells of the immune system are also made in the bone marrow. All of these cells develop from a type of precursor cell found in the bone marrow, called a \"hematopoietic stem cell.\" Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow; therefore stem cells can be collected or harvested from either location . Some of the most effective treatments for cancer, such as chemotherapy and radiation, are toxic to the bone marrow. In general, the higher the dose, the more toxic the effects on the bone marrow. After the treatment, a healthy supply of stem cells is reintroduced, or transplanted. The transplanted cells then reestablish the blood cell production process in the bone marrow. HSCT is a method of replacing imm ature blood -forming cells in the bone marrow that have been destroyed by drugs, radiation, or disease. It may be autologous (i.e., using a person's own stem cells) or allogeneic (i.e., using stem cells donated by someone else). Autologous transplant \u2014 In autologous transplantation, an individual's own hematopoietic stem cells are removed before the high dose chemotherapy or radiation is given, and they are then frozen for st orage and later use. After chemotherapy or radiation is complete, the harvested cel ls are thawed and returned to the individual, like a transfusion. Allogeneic transplant \u2014 In allogeneic transplantation, the hematopoietic stem cells come from a donor, ideally a brother or sister with a similar genetic makeup. If an individual does not ha ve a suitably matched sibling, an unrelated person with a similar genetic makeup may be used. Under some circumstances, a parent or child who is only half -matched can also be used; this is termed a haploidentical transplant. In other circumstances, umbilic al cord blood may be used in an umbilical cord blood transplant. Page 4 of 18 Medical Coverage Policy : 0534 Myeloablative transplant \u2014 A myeloablative transplant ation uses very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation prior to transplantation with autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. Non-myeloablative transplant \u2014 A non- myeloablative transplantation, sometimes referred to as reduced intensity transplant, allows an individual to have less intensive chemotherapy before transplantation with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. The idea is to minimize up front toxicity by using lower doses of intensive therapy, while retaining the immune graft versus tumor effect. This approach may be recommended for a variety of reasons including age, type of disease, other medical issues, or prior therapies. Contraindications Many factors affect the outcome of a tissue transplantation; the selection process is designed to obtain the best result for each individual. The presence of any significant comorbid conditions which would significantly compromise clinical care and chances of survival is a contraindication to transplant. Relative contraindications for HSCT include (but are not limited to): poor cardiac function (ejection fraction less than 35%) poor liver function (bilirubin greater than 2.0 mg/dL and transaminases greater than two times normal), unless related to disease poor renal function (creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min) (not applicable for most auto transplants) poor pulmonary func tion (diffusion capacity less than 50% of predicted) , human immunodeficiency v irus (HIV) if not controlled, active hepatitis B, hepatitis C , or human T -cell lymphotrophic virus type 1(HTLV -1) Karnofsky rating less than 60% and/or Eastern Cooperative Oncol ogy Group (ECOG) performance status greater than two Bone Cance r True (or primary) bone tumors start in the bone itself and may include: Osteosarcoma (also called osteogenic sarcoma) is the most common primary bone cancer. It starts in the bone cells. I t most often occurs in young people between the ages of 10 and 30, but about 10% of osteosarcoma cases develop in people in their 60s and 70s. Chondrosarcoma Ewing tumor/Ewing sarcoma is rare in adults older than 30 Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) mos t often starts in soft tissue (connective tissues such as ligaments, tendons, fat, and muscle); it's rare in bones. This cancer is also known as pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma, especially when it starts in soft tissues. This cancer most often occurs in elderly and middle- aged adults. It's quite rare in children. Central Nervous System (CNS) T umors Primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors are a diverse group of tumors originating in the br ain or spinal cord. CNS tumors develop f rom different cell types and form in different areas of the CNS. CNS tumors are more common in children than adults and constitute the most common solid tumors of childhood. Tumor location: The brain is divided into two compartments by the tentorium. Above the tentorium (supratentorial) are the cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, and the tentorium (infratentorial) pineal gland, the tectum, the pons, the medulla, and the cerebellum. Adult brain tumors tend to be supratentorial; however, pediatric tumors are evenly split between supratentorial and infratentorial. This division of location in the pediatric population is dependent on the age of the patient. Tumor type: Some CNS tumor types include astrocytoma/oligodendroglioma, intracranial and spinal cord tumors, meningiomas. Cranial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) are embryonal neoplasms showing varying degrees of differentiation. They are described by their location as infratentorial (medulloblastomas) and supratentorial (cerebral neuroblastoma, pineoblastoma, esthesioneuroblastoma). Germ Cell T umors (GCTs) Page 5 of 18 Medical Coverage Policy : 0534 Germ cell tumors are growths that form from reproductive cells. Tumors may be cancerous or non cancerous. Most germ cell tumors that are cancerous occur as either cancer of the ovaries (ovarian cancer) or cancer of the testicles (testicular cancer). Testicular cancer: More than 90% of cancers of the testicle start in cells known as germ cells. These are the cells that make sperm. The main types of GCTs in the testicles a re seminomas and non -seminomas. These types occur about equally. Seminomas tend to grow and spread mo re slowly than non - seminomas. Non -seminomas usually occur in men between their late teens and early 30s. Many testicular cancers contain both seminoma and non- seminoma cells. Ovarian: Germ cell tumors start from the cells that produce the eggs (ova). Less than 2% of ovarian cancers are germ cell tumors. Neuroblastoma Neuroblastoma starts in certain, very early forms of nerve cells, most often found in an embryo or fetus. This type of cancer occurs most often in infants and young children. It is rare in chi ldren older than 10 years. Neuroblastoma treatment depends on risk groups determined by cancer staging, the age of the child, tumor histology, and tumor biology. Ovarian C ancer The ovaries are mainly made up of 3 kinds of cells. Each type of cell can develop into a different type of tumor: Epithelial ovarian tumors start from the cells that cover the outer surface of the ovary. Most ovarian tumors are epithelial cell tumors. These tumors can be benign (not cancer), borderline (low malignant potential), or malignant (cancer). About 90% of malignant ovarian cancers are epithelial ovarian carcinomas. Germ cell tumors start from the cells that produce the eggs (ova). Less than 2% of ovarian cancers are germ cell tumors. Stromal tumors start from structural tiss ue cells that hold the ovary together and produce the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. Some of these tumors are benign (non- cancerous) and never spread beyond the ovary. Malignant (cancerous) or borderline (low malignant potential) ovarian tumors can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body and can be fatal. Retinoblastoma Retinoblastoma is a cancer that starts in the retina, the very back part of the eye. It is the most common type of eye cancer in children. Soft Tissue Sarcoma Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are the main two types of sarcoma. Soft tissue sarcomas can develop in soft tissues like fat, muscle, nerves, fibrous tissues, blood vessels, or deep skin tissues. They can be found in any part of the body. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma seen in children. In a review on racial disparities related to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), Majhail, et al. (2012) indicated that HSCT is a specialized, high- cost, and resource -intensive procedure ass ociated with racial disparities. The authors point to the following conclusions drawn from several studies that have addressed race and access to HSCT: Blacks are less likely than whites to receive H SCT. There is no association of race and outcomes for autologous HSCT; Black allogeniec HSCT recipients had higher risks of mortality compared with whites; and the effect of race was independent of socioeconomic status. Blacks had a shorter progression free survival compared with w hites after autologous HSCT for multiple myeloma; this study did not account for socioeconomic status. Page 6 of 18 Medical Coverage Policy : 0534 Black allo genei c matched unrelated donor recipients had worse overall survival, disease free survival, and higher treatment related mortality than whites; the effect of race was in dependent of socioeconomic status. Blacks had worse overall survival compared with whites after single umbilical cord blood H SCT; the study did not account for socioeconomic status. The authors cite several reasons for these disparities including donor av ailability and access to HSCT. In those patients who require allogenei c HSCT, there is a need for appropriately HLA -matched donors which has a much higher likelihood if the individuals are of the same race. According to the National Marrow Donor Program, 74% of donors are white, 10% are Hispanic, 7% are Black, and 7% are Asian. As such, the \"probability of finding a match within the registry is estimated to be 0.93 for whites, 0.82 for Hispanics, 0.77 for As ian Americans , and 0.58 for Blacks. \" Black patients with leukemia and lymphoma were 51- 53% and 34- 45% as likely , respectively, to receive HSCT compared to whites (p<0.05). Compared with private insurance, Medicaid patients were also less likely to receive HSCT. For all diseases, whites were significantly more likely than Blacks to receive HSCT (p<0.0001). This review highlights the need for additional research to better understand the factors contributing to these racial disparities and to develop intervent ions to eliminate the them . Similar findings were presented in a 2021 systematic review (n=40) of retrospective cohort studies, literature reviews, longitudinal studies, cross -sectional studies, and focus group samplings that aimed to summarize racial disparities related to HSCT referral, utilization, and survival.The author pointed to \"discouragement of potential donors, differences in treatment failure and/or transplant rejection, and overall stigmatization and mistrust of the medical profession\" as significant reasons for the worse outcomes that are seen in minority patients (Landry, 2021).

Five- year overall survival rates were 15% and 9% at 10 years. Data do not suggest an enduring benefit of allogeneic HSCT for the indications included in the study. Central Nervous System: Peer -reviewed published data are limited to small prospective case series and retrospective reviews and support the use of autologous HSCT in the treatment of supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) and medulloblastoma (Sung 2 013, Fangusaro 2008, Sung 2007) as well as primary of Tumors: The Ewing family of tumors is a group of cancers that start in the bones or nearby soft tissues that share some common features. These tumors can develop at any age, but they are most common in the early teen years. The main types of Ewing tum ors are: 1) Ewing sarcoma of bone, 2) Extraosseous Ewing tumor and 3) Peripheral primitiv e neuroectodermal tumor (PPNET) . Several uncontrolled trials demonstrated improved or survival outcomes with autologous HSCT ( Ferrari, 2011; Ladenstein, 2010). Germ cell randomized controlled clinical trial data have not demonst rated improved health outcomes with the use of high- dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT as a front -line therapy. Although data are not robust, the use of single or tandem HDC with autologous HSCT is considered an acceptable therapy for the treatment of i ndividuals with refractory or relapsed testicular and ovarian germ cell tumors. For metastatic germ -cell tumors, three cycles of high -dose chemotherapy, each cycle followed by HSCT, is considered an appropriate second- line treatment option ( ). Neuroblastoma: Treatment of neuroblastoma is dependent on risk groups. The stage of neuroblastoma is one factor used to determine risk group. Other factors are the age of the child, tumor histology, and tumor biology. Autologous HSCT is a standard treatment option for individuals classified as having high -risk disease. Improved survival has been demonstrated with the use of autologous HSCT compared with chemotherapy in several randomized controlled clinical trials . Although allogeneic HSCT has not been investigated in large numbers of patients, it may play a r ole in treatment of those patients who are not candidates for autologous HSCT when a HLA-matched donor is available (at least 5 of 6 HLA -match) ( Berthold, et al., 2018; London, 2017; 2008). Retinoblastoma: Retinoblastoma is a rel atively uncommon tumor of childhood that arises in the retina. Several prospective case series and retrospective studies have suggested the safety and effectiveness of autologous HSCT for the treatment of retinoblastoma (Lee, 2008; Kremens, 2003) . Treatmen t-related mortality was zero for all studies. In the study by Lee involving 14 children with bilateral disease, vision was preserved in one eye for nine patients and in both eyes doe two patients; without the use of external beam radiation. Disease-free su rvival (DFS) ranged from 42- 107 months ( de Jong, 2014; Dunkel, 2010). Soft tissue sarcoma: A retrospective analysis investigated the value of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT ) according to histological subtype in soft-tissue sarcoma ( STS) patients who were registered in the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation database between 1996 and 2016. Median progression -free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the entire cohort of 338 patients were 8.3 and 19.8 months, respectively, and P FS and OS at 5 years were 13% and 25%, respectively. Analysis of outcomes in different subgroups showed that younger age, better remission status before transplantation and melphalan -based preparative regimen were predictive of benefit from ASCT, whereas histology and grading had no statistically Page 14 of 18 Medical Coverage Policy : 0534 significant impact. The authors noted that their data do not allow for conclusions as to whether specific histological subgroups benefit more from ASCT than others. Thus, the authors concluded, ASCT should not be performed in routine clinical practice (Heilig, et al., 2020). Wilms tumor: Wilms tumor (also called Wilms' tumor or nephroblastoma) is the most common type of kidney cancer in children. Results regarding benefit to event -free-survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) are mixed; however, there are some data suggesting a survival benefit with high- dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT for relapsed disease (Malogolowkin, 2017; Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Foundation Choosing Wisely\u00ae Initiative No relevant statements.
