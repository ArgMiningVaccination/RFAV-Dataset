Summary Title: A Prospective Household observational cohort study of Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial virus and other respiratory pathogens community burden and Transmission dynamics in South Africa (The PHIRST Study) Partners: National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), Johannesburg, South Africa; University of Witwatersrand, School of Public Health, Johannesburg, South Africa ; United States Cent ers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta, United States of America (USA) ; Perinatal HIV Research Unit, Johannesburg, South Africa; MRC/ Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research (Agincourt), Bushbuckridge, South Africa ; Medical Research Council (Environment and Health Research Unit), Johannesburg, South Africa . Background: Information on the community burden of influenza is essential to inform control, but is not routinely collected. For example, influenza transmission models, which are widely used to inform the efficacy and cost -effectiveness of vaccines, antivirals and non -pharmaceutical countermeasures, depend on valid epi demiological estimates of the community occurrence and transmission of disease. While community level studies such as the Flu Watch cohort study in the United Kingdom have been implemented in recent years in high -income countries, the community burden of i nfluenza remains largely unknown in lower - and middle -income countries, especially in Africa where the burden of influenza may be higher. In addition, no data exist on the household transmission dynamics of influenza virus es. Such data could provide import ant insight to inform targeted interventions, for instance, how to maximize indirect effects of influenza vaccination to protect more vulnerable groups for which the available influenza vaccines are currently not licensed or the efficacy is low (e.g. child ren <2 years of age). Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of childhood acute lower respiratory tract infection, especially among infants <3 months of age. While a RSV vaccine is currently not available, the efficacy of promising RSV c andidate vaccines is being evaluated. Alternative strategies for RSV vaccination have been proposed, including vaccination of older age groups to indirect ly protect vulnerable infant s by reducing circulation of virus in the population or preventing chains of transmission to the infant. Nonetheless, to evaluate these effects knowledge of the RSV burden, transmission dynamic s and source of infection for infants in the community is needed . Pneumococcus is the leading bacterial cause of pneumonia. The pneumcoccal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced into the expanded programme on immunisation in 2009. Data on carriage prevalence, dynamics of carriage and interaction with other respirator y pathogens will be helpful to guide interventions to target pneumococcal disease not prevented by vaccination . Both dipht heria and pertussis have been i dentified as emerging pathogens in South Africa in recent years , giving rise to outbreaks in 2014 and 2 015 after years of low prevalence. Meningococcus is an epidemic -prone disease causing cyclical outbreaks in South Africa but little is known about the carri age prevalence in South Africa. Group A streptococcus (GAS) causes significant morbidity and mortali ty globally . Gas c arriage maybe a potential source for acquisition of infections for others in the community and therefore carriage strains may be of Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 8 relevance to active disease e.g. pharyngitis . However, there is limited data on GAS carriage in South Afri ca. Annual incidence of tuberculosis in Southern Africa is the highest globally, with Swaziland, Lesotho and South Africa have the highest rates of tuberculosis in the world. Moreover, in South Africa tuberculosis is the leading cause of death on death no tification forms and , in HIV -infected individuals (both not yet receiving antiretrovirals and whilst taking antiretrovirals ), is the leading serious opportunistic infection. Data on the carriage prevalence and/or transmission dynamics of these pathogens are important to guide control measures, including targeted vaccination strategies. Prevention efforts to limit transmission in household s are often recommended but data on hou sehold transmission and the impact of HIV infection are limited to date. Objectives Primary To estimate the community burden of influenza and RSV, including: (i) the incidence of influenza and RSV infection in the community; (ii) the symptomatic fraction associated with influenza and RSV infection; (iii) the severity associated with symptomatic infections; and (iv) the fraction of individuals with symptomatic infection seeking medical care. To assess the transmission dynamics of influenza and RSV infection s in the community, including: (i) the estimation of the household secondary infection risk (SIR), serial interval and length of shedding; (ii) the estimation of transmission of infection between age groups within the household and possibly the community; and (iii) the estimation of the effective reproductive number ( Rt) and its variation over time in the community. Secondary (selected) To estimate the symptomatic fraction, the severity associated with symptomatic infections and the fraction of individuals with symptomatic infection seeking medical care among influenza or RSV positive cases by HIV serostatus and age. To estimate the SI R and length of shedding of influenza and RSV among HIV -infected and HIV - uninfected index cases and the rate of acquisition o f influenza and RSV infection among HIV -infected and HIV -uninfected household members. To assess the role of asymptomatic infections in the household transmission of influenza an d RSV. Determine the heterogeneity of influenza and RSV virus strains within household clusters and describe viral evolution within and between households as well as the association between virus strains and the duration of virus shedding and HIV status To describe and compare nasopharyngeal pneumococcal loads in healthy individual s by age and over time, and how the loads may be altered by respiratory viral infection, HIV -status and vaccination - status To identify the prevalence and duration of B. pertussis colonization within the community by age group, vaccine status and over time, the transmission dynamics within a household, and the proportion of individuals that develop symptomatic infection Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 9 To determine the prevalence of N. meningitidis , C. diphtheria e and S. pyogenes colonization within the community by age group at a single point in time each year To measure the annual incidence of tuberculosis infection in individuals living in study households and assess risk factors (including incident and prevalent HIV) for acqu iring tuberculosis infection. To ascertain the impact of housing quality, fuel use and indoor air quality and selected measures of ventilation on tuberculosis infection and on household transmission of respiratory viruses and bacteria Methods: We will co nduct a household -level community cohort study in a rural community in Mpumalanga Province where health and demographic surveillance ( HDSS) is conducted (the Agincourt HDS S surveillance site) and selected urban area s in the Matlosana Muncipality in North West Province . Prospective, hospital -based surveillance for influenza - and RSV -associated severe acute respiratory illness has been conducted at th ese sites since 20 10. The prospective cohort study will be conducted for 3 consecutive years , from 2016 -2018, to include 3 consecutive RSV and influenza seasons. Approximately one hundred households ( 50 household s per site, with an expected average number of household members of 5 to re cruit a total of 500 enrolled individuals) will be randomly selected within the study population each year and consented to participate to the study. For each household member , serum will be collected quarterly (January -February, April -May, September -October and November -December) including before and after the RSV (February to May ) and influenza (May to September) seasons and a final blood draw at the end of the year . The demographic characteristic s of the household members will be collected on enrollment. Starting before the RSV and influenza seasons , upper respiratory tract samples will be collected twice -a-week by trained study nurses from all household member s irrespective of the presence of respiratory symptoms throughout the year . During each visit the development of symptoms (using a severity score) and healthcare seeking behav ior of symptomatic cases will be recorded. In addition, during winter at one household visit , an oropharyngeal swab will be collected from each individual for testing for meningococcus , diphtheria and GAS . Nasopharyngeal samples will be tested for the dete ction of RSV or influenza virus and pneumococcus and B. pertussis infection by real -time reverse - transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt -PCR). Blood samples will be tested for rise in RSV , influenza and pertussis antibody titers. From consenting patien ts, blood samples will be tested for HIV infection. For tuberculosis infection, we will do a tuberculin skin test (TST) at baseline and the end of the first year and annually thereafter in people are found to be TST negative at their previous test. HIV te sting will be offered to all participants at baseline and then six monthly thereafter. All participants will have a sputum sample taken for culture at baseline and thereafter sputum will be collected based on symptoms of cough (> 1 week duration) for TB (Xpert Mtuberculosis/Rif) and pertussis The sample size of approximately 1500 individuals over 3 consecutive seasons will allow the estimation of 20% risk of infection and a 10% risk of illness with 95% CI and 5% desired absolute precision in the community . Individuals in the households enrolled in the first and second year of the study will be have a three follow -up visit towards in the 2nd and 3rd year of the study ( February, May and October) . At th ese visits a blood specimen for testing for , influenza and RSV serology will be collected . In addition, HIV and TST testing will be done twice a year on those who tested negative on the previous test. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 10 Impact: This study will improve understand ing of the community burden of influenza , RSV, pertussis , tuberculos is and pneumococcal infection in South Africa. It will also provide data on the carriage prevalence of meningococcus , diphtheria and GAS . The data generated from this study will also provide important information on the transmission dynamics of influenza, RSV, pertussis and pneumococcus in the community allowing to better strategize interventions (including targeted vaccination strategies) and evaluate their potential impact. Moreover, there is an absence of prospective data on tuberculosis infection from h igh tuberculosis burden countries. The data generated will both inform modelling of transmission, sample size for prevention studies and surveillance assessing the impact of the National Tuberculosis Control Program. 2.

Background 7.1. Influenza Internationally, influenza surveillance provides real-time information to inform prevention and control policies[1]. However, in most cases, influenza surveillance focuses on cases seeking medical attention. Information on the community burden of influenza is key to inform control [2], but is not routinely collected. For example, influenza transmission models, which are widely used to inform the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of vaccines, antivirals and non -pharmaceutical countermeasures, depend on valid epidemiological estimates of the community occurrence of disease [3]. While community level studies such as the Flu Watch cohort study in the United Kingdom have been implemented in recent years in high - income countries [3], the community burden of influenza remain s largely unknown in lower - and middle - income countries, especially in Africa where the burden of influenza may be higher. In addition, limited data exist on the household transmission dynamic s of influenza virus at the individual level . Such data could provide important insight to inform targeted intervention s, for instance, how to maximize indirect effect s of influenza vaccination to protect mo re vulnerable groups for which the available influenza vaccines are currently not licensed or the efficacy is low (e.g. children <2 years of age) . 7.2. Respiratory syncytial virus Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the commonest cause of childhood acut e lower respiratory tract infection , especially among infants <3 months of age [4]. While a RSV vaccine is currently no t available, the efficacy of promising RSV candidate vaccine s is being eva luated [5]. Nonetheless, there are considerable obstacles confronting the development of vaccines targeting young infants, including immaturity of the immune system and presence of maternal RSV -specific antibodies; both of which are associated with suboptimal vaccine responses [6]. Alternative strategies for RSV vacc ination have been proposed [7], including delaying delivery to an older age [8]. In ad dition to direct protection of the recipient, vaccination of older age groups may lead to indirect protection of the vulnerable infant by reducing circulation of virus in the population or preventing chains of transmission to the infant [7]. Future availability of more affordable generic candidates of palivizumab (the only currently available treatment for RSV) targeting the RSV fusion (F) protein will potentially lead to more widespread use of these drugs to treat RSV disease in very young children. Reports of RSV variants with reduced susceptibility to palivizumab have been reported which also highlights the need to monitor drift in circulating st rains. Nonetheless, to evaluate the impact of these interventions knowledge of the RSV burden, transmission dynamic and source of infection for infants in the community is needed. 7.3. Bacterial pathogens The development of bacterial respiratory tract and in vasive infections is preceded by nasopharyngeal coloni zation with the infecting pathogen. Although colonization is a prerequisite for the development of disease, the majority of individuals remain asymptomatic and only a small proportion of colonized indiv iduals develop disease. There is a complex interplay of host, pathogen and environmental factors that determine whether the coloni sing organisms will be cleared by the host's immune system or transmitted to cavities such as the lungs and/or cross the mucos al barrier and invade normally sterile sites resulting in invasive disease. While factors such as underlying Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) infection [9, 10] are established risk factors for developing disease, other factors remain unknown. At an y one point in time, the nasopharynx of an individual is inhabited by a complex microbiome of pathogens. Use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the etiology of respiratory tract Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 16 infections [11-13] has highlighted the prevalence of polymicrobial respiratory tract infections [14-16]. The interaction of these co -existing pathogens in the upper respiratory tract plays an important role in the bacterial loads of the organism in the nasopharynx, and developmen t of disease. The interaction between the pneumococcus and influenza virus is one of the most well documented synergistic bacterial -viral interactions, with influenza virus infection being a risk factor for the subsequent development of pneumococcal diseas e [17, 18]. In a previous study we have shown that respiratory v irus infection is associated with elevated pneumococcal colonization density and, in turn, invasive pneumococcal pneumonia [19]. Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is an acute respiratory illness caused by Bordetella pertussis . B. pertussis can be asymptomatically carried but may also cause severe disease, particularly in infants.[20] Pertussis is vaccine -preventable, and routine use of the whole -cell vaccine for decades has significantly reduced the burden of disease in South Africa, and around the world. However, due to the adverse side e ffects associated with the whole -cell vaccine many countries have changed to the acellular vaccine, including South Africa in 2009. A number of countries, such as the U nited States of America , have recently documented increases in pertussis disease which i s thought to potentially be due to waning immunity to the acellular vaccine. There are limited data on the prevalence of B. pertussis carriage and disease in South Africa, and this is of particular importance as the acellular vaccine has been in use for 6 years. In 2015, data from routine surveillance, have demonstrated an increasing incidence of pertussis infection in several provinces of South Africa [21]. Invasive disease (meningitis and bacteraemia) caused pathogen Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) rem ains a significant problem worldwide. The ecological niche for N. meningitidis is the human nasopharynx/throat and carriage rates are approximately 5 -10% during endemic disease but may be significantly higher during epidemics or in closed communities [22]. Carriage is most frequent in teenagers and young adults and overcrowding increases the risk of meningococcal carriage and dise ase [23]. Meningococcal disease is a ra re outcome of carriage and the interaction of host, pathogen and environmental factors is poorly understood. Carriage data are thus important in trying to further our understanding of disease and potentially improve patient management. Although we have a comprehensive systematic collection of invasive meningococcal isolates collected through national surveillance since 2000, there are no carriage data for meningococcus in South Africa.[24] The most common clinical presentation of Corynebacterium diphtheriae infection is an upper respiratory tract infection, most commonly involving the tonsils, pharynx, larynx, or nasal mucosa [25].The incubation period is usually between 2 to 5 days, and humans are the only known reservoir. Infection is acquired by respiratory droplet spread. In the prevaccine era, circulation of C. diphtheriae organisms was common, and symptomatic and asymptomatic infections provided the opportunity to acquire immunity, so that in both high - and low -income countries natural immunity was rapidly acquired, and by the age of 15 years, most individuals had acquired natural immunity[25, 26]. In countries with routine infant diphtheria vaccination programmes, the level of immunity in older children and young adults declines, especially witho ut regular booster vaccinations[26]. The latter accumulate as a susceptible pool of adults, and together with the presence o f susceptible children (e.g., due to low vaccination coverage), may allow for the possibility of outbreaks[26]. In such settings, the bacterium may be commonly carried in the nasopharynx of asymptomatic individuals, especially in settings of low vaccine coverage or waning immunity. South Africa recently experienced a large outbreak of diphtheria in KwaZulu -Natal in 2014 - 2015. [27] Conditions, thought to be likely causes of the outbreak i.e. very low coverage (<50%) for the 6 and 9 year diphtheria booster vaccines are widespread in all provinces of South Africa. There are no data on the prevalence of diphtheria amongst asymptomatic individuals in South Africa. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 17 7.4. Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus (GAS)) GAS is associated with a range of infections including skin infections, pharyngitis and more severe invasive disease (endocarditis, septic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis) . Repeated GAS infections may be associated with acute post infection complications such as glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease ([28], [29]). Invasive disease rates vary by region with between 1 -3 cases per 100 000 persons described [30, 31] [32]. Globally between 5% and 15% of children carry GAS in their throats. Carriage of GAS may occur for months after resolution of an infection or may be independent of a clinical infection. Carriage maybe a potential source for acq uisition of infections for others in the community[33, 34] and therefore carriage strains may be of relevance to active disease e.g. pharyngitis . Molecular characterisation of the GAS strains associated with carriage may g ive insights to risk factors associated with developing GAS active disease as some asymptomatic carriers have been shown to maintain the same strain when progressing to active disease[35]. In 2017 NICD was involved in investigating an outbreak of necrotis ing fasciitis caused by GAS, (with a high case fatality ratio , 75% among invasive cases ) in a long -term care facility . In this outbreak there was also a high prevalence, 14%, of asymptomatic colonization among staff members. This is the first such outbreak to be described in South Africa. Following this outbreak gaps in surveillance for GAS have been identified, including lack of recent data on GAS carriage in healthy people, although there are a few small studies among indivi duals with pharyngitis or rheumatic heart disease ([36], [37]). The PHIRST study provides an unique opportunity to as sess carriage of GAS in the community and will provide three consecutive years of data. In addition, rheumatic heart disease (non -infectious complication of GAS) notifications are being reassessed with the new notifiable medical condition legislation in So uth Africa . These data combined with data from additional surveillance programme such as GERMS will enable us to describe to describe and better understand the epidemiology of GAS in our setting. Data on GAS carriage in South Africa will also make an impor tant contribution to the regional and global data on GAS , a pathogen that has gained more attention in recent years as some countries have reported an increase in incidence of invasive disease [38-41]. 7.5. Tuberculosis Despite the recent evidence of initial reductions in tuberculosis rates in South Africa, tuberculosis in Southern Africa remains an extremely severe publi c health problem. Annual incidence of tuberculosis disease in South Africa massively increased over the past three decades, mostly as a result of the HIV epidemic. And in 2012, South Africa's annual incidence of tuberculosis is ranked third globally with a lmost 1% of all individuals in South Africa are diagnosed with tuberculosis disease each year. HIV -infected individuals bear the brunt of the disease as over 60% of all patients with tuberculosis are co -infected with HIV. Mortality and morbidity associat ed with tuberculosis is severe, ~10% of all cases die and of tuberculosis cases admitted to hospital almost one quarter die during their admission. However, details on the transmission and acquisition of tuberculosis are scanty, and data on prevalence an d incidence of tuberculosis infection are unknown as there are few contemporaneous studies from Southern Africa reporting rates of tuberculosis infection in different settings, and no prospective studies that report risk factors for incident tuberculosis infection. A cross -sectional report from Cape Town suggests that scholars Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 18 who recently started high school have a dramatic increase in annual risk of tuberculosis infection [42] and our cross -sectional data from Matlosana show that the annual risk of infection in children at cr\u00e8che or recently started school is 2.5% per annum [43]. People infected with tuberculosis are the reservoir of tuberculosis cases in the future and partially reflect the efficiency of the South Afric an National Tuberculosis Control Programme to curb tuberculosis transmission by identifying infectious cases and treating them early. Having prospective estimates of incidence of tuberculosis infection and risk factors for tuberculosis infection (includi ng the presence of a case of infectious tuberculosis in the household) will provide valuable data for subsequent clinical trials of preventing tuberculosis , modelling the impact of control measures and, assessing the impact of the National Tuberculosis Control Programme. 7.6. HIV Although the public health antiretroviral therapy programme which has initiated over 2.6 million people on antiretroviral treatment ( ART) since 2004 has had immediate and dramatic beneficial impacts on survival, risk of opportunistic in fection, quality of life and household wealth; HIV incidence remains high. Recent reports of HIV incidence for the country [44], and in the non -intervention arms of clinical trials of prevention interventions show that HIV incidence overall remains high. Despite this , there is little HIV incidence data in prospectively followed cohorts. A massive condom distribution program, a nationwide male circumcision program, and the step wise increasing the CD4 threshold for initiation of antiretroviral therapy from a base of 20 0 cells/mm3 to the current 500 cells/mm3 should reduce HIV incidence. However, there is a reliance on cross -sectional surveys to assess r eductions in HIV incidence. Our study should add to understanding of the impact of HIV infection on transmission and acquisition of a range of respiratory pathogens and, may also provide some insight into new HIV infections. 7.7. Indoor air pollution Despite the rollout of a massive electrif ication programme over the past two decades, large numbers of South African households continue to make use of polluting fuels for cooking and space heating. Evidence reviews have shown that the risk of pneumonia in young children is increased by exposure to unprocessed solid fuels by a factor of 1.8 [45, 46]. In the South African context therefore, an ex amination of the role of exposure to domestic air pollution in respiratory disease transmission is of high importance. 7.7 Household contact patterns and disease transmission Respiratory infections spread mainly through large droplets and self -inoculation f rom contaminated surfaces [47, 48]. Measuring the quantity and durati on of face -to-face interactions among people is important to understand this transmission [49-51]. Most of the contacts we make tend to be in limited social groupings such as households, school or work setting [52], and this has also been suggested to influence the spread of respiratory pathogens [53, 54]. Despite the importance of empirical rates of contact in transmission models, data from developing countries are limited even though there is a heavy bur den of respiratory and other infectious diseases from these settings [4, 55 -58]. In infectious disease epidemiology, contact networks consist of individuals ( nodes) with connections between (edges) that represent interactions which can lead to infection transmission [59]. For respiratory Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 19 and close contact infections, social contact networks can be used to highlight potential transmission routes [60]. Questionnaire surveys have been conventionally used to collect data on contact patterns [61-66] and net works [67-71]. Despite providing \"who -contacts -whom\" matrices that can be incorporated into mathematical models of infection transmission and control [65, 66, 72, 73], the questionnaire method suffers several limitations key being recall bias and low participation rates [51, 63, 65]. Current models that omit important factors such as frequency, duration and location of contacts do not capture the heterogeneity of transmission that has direct bearing on intervention measures [74, 75]. Efforts to provide methods that aim to cover these gaps have resulted in the use and advancement of automated methods of data collection. These include the wireless sensors embedded in portable devices such as mobile phones and customized wearable tags that use Bluetooth and WiFi [76, 77] or low power radio frequencies [[78, 79], respectively, to determine proximity and co -location of users. Radio frequen cy (RF) proximity sensors (henceforth referred to as \"tags\") have been used in closed settings such as schools [49, 80, 81], hospitals[79, 82 -84], work [85] and conferences [86] to characterize close contact social networks relevant to the spread of respiratory infections. The sensor platform in these studies has been designed to collect proximity data only from individuals facing each other while wearing the tags, representing conversations or actual physical touch that can lead to infection transmission (http://www.sociopatterns.org ). The majority of studies using thi s platform reported a high participation rate (75%) suggesting that an unobtrusive way of data collection requiring minimal participant intervention elicits better response rates compared to paper diaries [5], especially in settings with a high proportion of illiterate individuals and have been shown to be feasible in a rural Kenyan setting [87]. Despite the relatively high initial cost of design and production, tags provide a rich data source, even for partial networks, that can be used to in vestigate plausible characteristics of infection transmission on networks weighted by frequency and duration of contacts. In addition, statistical methods are available to impute missing data by generating synthetic networks based on the network properties supplemented by additional demographic assumptions [33]. 8. Justification for the study and study impact This study will provide better understand ing of the community burden of selected respiratory viral and bacterial pathogen infection s in South Africa. The data generated from this study will also provide important information on the transmission dynamics of these pathogens in the community (including its determinants) allowing to better strategize for interventions (including potentiall y cocooning vaccination strategies for selected pathogens like influenza , pertussis and potentially RSV , and targeting groups at highest risk of transmission for diseases such as meningococcus, diphtheria, pertussis and pneumococcus ) and evaluate their pot ential impact. The additional data on GAS carriage will build a new dataset to describe the prevalence of GAS carriage and molecular charecterisation of GAS strains (emm type profile ) in our setting. In addition, for influenza , dip htheria , GAS and meningococcus, information obtained on carriage prevalence and or transmission within households will be useful to inform preparedness and response to outbreaks.

Study design overview We will conduct a household -level prospective cohort study in one rural and one peri -urban community located in Mpumalanga Province (the Agincourt demographic surveillance site) and North West Province (Klerksdorp), respectively. The characteristic s of the st udy population are provided in S ection 10.3. The study will be conducted for 3 consecutive RSV and influenza seasons (2016, 2017 and 2018) over a 12 - month period each year (January through December). One hundred households ; 50 per site with expected average number of household members of 5; will be randomly selected every year within the study population and consented to participate in the study. The process o f household selection is described in Section 10.5 . The study will be conducted over three years because influenza transmission intensity as well as circulating influenza strains are known to vary substantially from year -to-year. If the study were conducted for only one year, biased measures may be obtained if the year is a particularly high or low transmission year. Each household member will be followed up for the calendar year of selection . In addition, for individuals enrolled in the first and second year of the study, three follow -up visits will be conducted annually to collect serum for serology of influenza and RSV . At two of the visits TST testing and HIV testing will be done/offered to those testing negative on previous tests. At the time of enrollment , the demographic characteristics of each individual within the selected household will be recorded (Appendix 2 Form 2 ), each household and household member will be enumerated and the HIV and tuberculosis infection status of each household member will be assesse d in consenting individuals . Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 24 In Agincourt, there is a high rate of migrancy and therefore we expect that many ho useholds will have one or more household members who work and reside elsewhere but spend weekends or holiday periods within the household. The se individuals will be enumerated in the baseline survey consented for study participation if they are present at any household visit. Thereafter, if they are present in the household at the time of a household visit , forms will be completed and specimens will be collected from them as per other household members for that visit . When not present, they will be recorded as absent . 10.2.1. Estimation of the community burden of influenza , RSV, C. diphtheria e and B. pertussis infection For each household member paired sera will be collected before and after the RSV ( January -February and April -May seasons to assess sero -conversion for the specific pathogen during the time of viral activity. An additional specimen will be collected at the end of the year to assess for viral infection out of the season. For the assessment of RSV sero -conversion a first serum sample will be collected in January -February while for the assessment of influenza virus sero -conversion a first serum sample will be collected in April - May , this will also serve as the second serum sample for the RSV season . In addition a serum sample will be collected after the estimated end of the influenz a season (September -October) and a final specimen at the end of the year (November -December) . The actual time of specimen collection will be decided after reviewing data on in fluenza and RSV circulation. The end of the RSV or influenza season (e.g. weekly detection rate for the specific pathogen <10% for 2 consecutive weeks) will be estimated from national RSV and influenza surveillance. Serum specimens will also be tested for the presence of antibodies to B. pertussis and C. diphtheriae. The baseline survey will allow estimation of the baseline prevalence of immunity and recent infection. Testing of follow -up sera will provide information on rates of acquisition of infection. 10.2.2. Estimation of the transmission dynamics of influenza, RSV, S. pneumonia and B. pertussis in the community Following enrollment , upper respiratory tract samples (nasoph aryngeal swabs ) will be collect ed twice a week from each household member irrespective of symptoms during the study period . Samples will be tested for RSV, influenza and other respiratory viruses as well as the selected bacteria throughout the study period . During each visit a follow up questionnaire will be administered to household members t o assess development and severity of symptoms and contact patterns among individuals within the household. 10.2.3. Estimation of the carriage prevalence of N. meningitidis , C. diphtheriae and S.pyogenes in the community In the month of July each year , we will conduct a cross -sectional survey to measure the carriage prevalence of N. meningitidis and C. diphtheriae in the study population. For the conduct of this survey, in addition to the nasopharyngeal swab being collected, we will collect a once -off oropharyngeal swab specimen. The nasopharyngeal and or opharyngeal specimens collected at this visit will be tested for N. meningitidis and C. diphtheriae using PCR as described below. The oropharyngeal specimens will be tested for N. meningitidis and C. di phtheriae using culture as described below. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 25 For GAS we will retrospectively test all samples collected in 2016 and 2017 initially by PCR and prospectively in 2018 by culture, PCR and whole genome sequencing, details are described below . 10.2.4. Estimation of the transmission dynamics of M. tuberculosis and HIV in the community At the time of enrollment (January -February) all consenting patients will be offer ed HIV testing as described in S ection 10.11.5 after counselling. At the time of enrollme nt (January), and again at the end of the study year (December) all individuals will be tested for tuberculosis infection using the tuberculin skin test (TST). This will allow estimation of tuberculosis incidence. Follow -up HIV tests will be offered every six months in those who were found to be HIV -negative at baseline . Follow -up TST for all patients previously TST -negative will be placed and read in December of the first study year. Thereafter at annual follow -up visits in October , HIV testing and TST wi ll be performed in those who were negative previously . We will also take specimens from anyone who is HIV -infected at baseline to assess prevalence of recent HIV infection. In addition, a t baseline, all household participants will provide a sputum sampl e for liquid mycobacterial culture. Thereafter, participants will be screened for symptoms of tuberculosis at least monthly and if they have symptoms of active tuberculosis, a sputum specimen for analysis by Xpert M tuberculosis /Rif will be taken . All pati ents testing positive for tuberculosis will be referred to the local clinic for treatment. 10.2.5. Assessment of environmental factors associated with pathogen transmission Information on housing type, construction materials, access to basic environmental health services, dampness and the presence of mould, and fuel use for daily cooking, space and water heating will be collected through the administration of a pre -structured questionnaire. Levels of indoor air pollution (particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5), carbo n monoxide and carbon dioxide ) will be measured using stationary monitoring devices over a period of one week during the winter as well as in the summer. During the same period, one member of each household will keep an air quality monitoring device on their person in order to measure air quality in all locations they visit. This device will have a GPS logger attached to it in order to measure the geographic location of air samples collected. Logtag instruments will be located in all study dwellings to moni tor indoor temperature and humidity over a period of one year. Floor dust samples will be collected from each dwelling using US EPA/HUD methods once during the winter and once during the summer . Details of methods for environmental assessment are provided in Appendix 3. 10.2.6. Assessment of household social contact associated with pathogen transmission Information on proximity data between household members will be collected from consenting household members. A pilot study, aiming to assess the acceptability, feas ibility and variation in data using proximity tags will be conducted in 5 households at each site for 4 weeks during September and October of 2017. In 2018, all participating households will be asked to wear the proximity tag devices for a period of 8 - 12 Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 26 days , repeated every 4 - 6 weeks . All participating household member s will be asked to complete a questionnaire twice during the follow -up period on their time use and social contacts (appendix 6) which will be used to validate and supplement the proxi mity tag data. 10.3. Study setting and population The study will be conducted at two sites, one in the Mpumalanga province and one in the North West Province. 10.3.1. Mpumalanga Province site The study will be conducted within the health and socio -demographic surveillance site (HDSS) at the MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research Unit (Agincourt) . The population is approximately 110,000 people and is set in the rural Bushbuckridge Distri ct of Mpumalanga Province. 10.3.2. North West Province Site Klerksdorp is located in the local municipality of Matlosana in North West Province and has a population of over 385,000 people and is 115 km2. The city of Klerksdorp is surrounded by the townships of Jouberton, Alabama, Kanana, Khuma, and Tigane. The t ownships are organized into extensions that include mostly single -family houses and shacks. Prevalence of HIV in Klerksdorp is approximately 12% .5 Annual incidence of tuberculosis is extremely high approaching 1200/100 ,000 with an HIV coinfection rate of over 80%. 10.4. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Eligible households will be randomly selected households that have been residing in the selected communities for at least one year prior to the commencement of the study, that conse nt to participate to the study and that are planning to reside in the selected community for the duration of the study. Households should have at least 3 or more individuals in order to be eligible. In addition, at least 50% of households should have at le ast one child aged <5 years in the household. Non -eligible households will be households that were not randomly selected, that were selected but did not consent to participate to the study or, that have 1 household member s that do not consent for inclusio n in the study . 10.5. Sampling and sample size The sample size of approximately 1500 individuals over 3 consecutive years will allow the estimation of 10% risk of infection and a 5% risk of illness or higher with 95% CI and 5% desired absolute precision in the c ommunity for the selected pathogens. This should be adequate to address the objectives for influenza and RSV as infection rates of at least 10% are expected.[3, 88] Two -hundred households (estimated mean household size: 5 members) will be initially randomly selected annually within each of the two selected communities. This will allow sufficient households to ensure that we meet the target of 50 households per site meeting study criteria and considering study refusal. The selection process will be based on a two -stage cluster sampling design whereby 3 -5 township extensions (in Klerksdorp) and 3 -5 villages (in Agincourt) will be randomly sel ected first. The same number of households will be then randomly selected within each of the selected extensions or villages. The sampling frame (e.g. list of dwellings within the selected communities) will be obtained from Statistics South Africa for Kler ksdorp and the Agincourt HDSS Database. Selected household will be visited prior to the Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 27 commencement of the study to verify inclusion criteria and consenting. The verification process will continue until 50 households in each of the two selected communitie s will be successfully enrolled, including at least 50% of households with children aged <7 years. Five additional households in each community will be enrolled to cater for loss to follow -up. The selection process will be repeated before the beginning of each study year as described above. Households that were selected in the previous study years will not be eligible for selection in consecutive years. A household in whom >2 0% of individuals decide to suspend study participation will be considered suspend ed. If a household is suspended or decides to withdraw from the study during the RSV season (January to April), a new household will be enrolled to replace the household for the next upcoming influenza season (May to December ). 10.6. Recruitment period and foll ow up visits 10.6.1. Recruitment Household identification and recruitment will be implemented from November of the year preceding the study year . Upon random selection of dwelling s within the selected community , household s will be visited by trained staff to verif y inclusion criteria and consenting. Written informed consent will be obtained from each household member as detailed in Section 10. 6.1 and Appendix 4. Each enrolled household and household member will be enumerated and the demographic characteristic of th e household will be recorded. The physical address and /or global positioning system ( GPS) coordinate of each dwelling will also be recorded. The starting time of the study (January of each study year ) will be communicated to the primary caregiver. As household recruitment proceeds, the number of households with children aged < 5 years will be reviewed. When 50% of households have been recruited the proportion of households with children aged <5 years will be evaluated and thereafter households with chil dren may be preferentially selected until the target is met (e.g. at least 50% of households with at least one children <5 years of age). After enrollment and enumeration of t he target number of household s is completed , the number of enrolled household mem bers will be evaluated to assess that the target sample size is met. If the number of enrolled household members is below 90% of the target number of household members then additional households will be recruited until the target sample size is met. After recruitment is completed , a first visit and follow -up plan for each household will be developed. The exact start date of the study will be then communicated to the primary caregiver by telephone or household visit 2 weeks before the assigned start date of the study. This process will be repeated for each study year and if new households are enrolled mid -year . Any babies who are born into the study household during the study period will be recruited. Detailed baseline questionnaire s on household make -up, de mographics, regular sleeping and eating arrangements, occupation and underlying illnesses will be completed (Appendix 2, Questionnaire 2 and 3 ) A detailed diagram of the study visits is provided in Figure 1. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 28 Figure 1: PHIRST Study Chronogram * 500 individuals from 100 households. ** In addition to baseline, expectorated sputum for tuberculosis testing will be collected whenever symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis are recorded. *** Symptoms Forms (Form 7), Hospitalization Forms (Form 9) and Death Forms (Form 10) will be administered whenever a household member was symptomatic, hospitalized or died during the twice -weekly follow -up visits. 10.6.2. First study visit The first study visit at each household will take place between the second week of January and the second week of February of each study year. At the first study visit the household demographics on record will be verified and the follow -up schedule will be communicated and agreed upon with the head of the household and household members. A copy of the follow up visits calendar wi ll be provided to the head of the household . During the first study visit the following specimens will be collected and assessments made for each household member or the whole household as appropriate : A serum sample wil l be collected for serological testing for influenza, RSV, pertus sis and diphtheria. If serum is insufficient influenza and RSV testing will be prioritized, followed by pertussis and diphtheria. A tuberculin skin test will be performed and read 48 -72 hours ther eafter An expectorated sputum specimen for culture will be collected HIV testing will be offered as described under the section HIV testing below Nasopharyngeal swabs will be collected for bacterial and viral detection A urine specimen will be taken from all individuals who are able to provide a urine sample A copy of the vaccination card of all children aged <18 years and the verbal vaccination history for influenza vaccine and other vaccines outside of the routine infant immunization schedule of ea ch household member will be collected A structured questionnaire will be administered to assess presence, duration and severity of symptoms as well as contact patterns among individuals within the household (Appendix 2, Questionnaire 7) Housing typology, visible signs of the presence of indoor air pollution (fossil fuel heating device, ashtrays or other signs of indoor smoking, number of windows and doors, number of people sleeping in each room and household, etc. will be recorded (Appendix 2, Questionnair e 4 and 5) Logtag instruments will be located in all study dwellings to monitor indoor temperature and hum idity over a period of one year The date and time of the next visit will be communicated and agreed upon 10.6.3. Twice -weekly f ollow -up visits After the first study visit , each household will be visited twice per week according to a pre -established schedule. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 29 During each visit the following will take place: Nasopharyngeal swabs will be collected for bacterial and viral detection Structured questionnaire s will be administered to assess presence, duration and severity of symptoms, contact patterns among individuals within the household and the history of any tuberculosis testing that the household member may have undergone outside of the study procedures For symptomatic individuals the following will be pe rformed at each visit until symptoms resolve : o A digital temperature will be measured and documented o A detailed symptom history will be completed (Appendix 2, Questionnaire 7) o Healthcare seeking behavior wil l be recorded o For any individuals who are admitted to hospital or die a detailed form (A ppendix 2, Questionnaire 9 and 10 ) will be completed to collect information on clinical presentation, management and laboratory results . o Individuals who warrant admission to hospital with respiratory illness will be referred to Matikwana or Mapulaneng Hospital in Mpumalanga and Klerksdorp or Tshepong Hospital in Klerksdorp and enrolled into the NICD pneumonia surveillance programme ( Wits H REC Protocol number M140824 ). At least monthly, during the household visit, symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis[89] (cough and/or fever and/or drenching night sweats and/or unexplained weight loss) will be screened for (Appendix 2, Questionnaire 8) and if any one is identified, the following will take place then a sputum sp ecimen for ana lysis using the Xpert M tuberculosis /Rif will be taken. All patients testing positive for t uberculosis will be referred for treatment to the local clinic. 10.6.4. Annual visit for the survey of meningococcal , diphtheria and GAS carriage Once a year in the month of July, in addition to the nasopharyngeal specimen collected on the twice - weekly visits, we will collect an oropharyngeal swab for detection of meningococcus and diphtheria colonization by PCR and culture. For GAS the samples collected in 2016 and 2017 wil l be tested retrospectively. 10.6.5. Assessment of levels of indoor air pollution Levels of indoor a ir pollution (particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) and carbon monoxide) will be measured using stationary monitoring devices over a period of one week during the winter as well as in the summer. During the same period one member of each household will be as ked to carry a portable air quality monitoring device with them. This will be pre -arranged with the household based on instrument availability. In addition, at the same time we will assess levels of dust in the household. 10.6.6. December end -of-year visit Towards the end of the year, at the first household visit in December a follow -up TST will be performed on all household members who tested negative previously. At this visit a copy of the vaccination card and the vaccination history of each household member aged <18 years will also be evaluated at this visit to ascertain if vaccination status has changed during the study year.

Quarterly follow -up visits Follow -up visits for the collection of additional blood specimens will be performed in April -May (before the in fluenza season) , September -October (after the influenza and RSV seasons) and November - December (the end of the year) . The exact date within these months will be determined by reviewing data on influenza and RSV transmission to ensure that the post season s pecimens are taken when pathogen circulation has dropped below 10%. At these visits all specimens and information will be collected as per twice -weekly follow -up visits . In addition , a blood specimen will be collected from each household member . At the April-May and September -October and November -December visits the detailed baseline questionnaire on household make -up, demographics, regular sleeping and eating arrangements, occupation, fuel use, underlying illnesses will be repeated ( Appendix 2 Questio nnaire 2, 4, 5 ). 10.6.8. Annual follow -up visits for individuals enrolled in the first and second year of the study For individuals enrolled in the first and second year of the study, we will perform three visits per year in each subsequent year, one in February, one in May and one in October. This means that the first c ohort of households will hav e 2 years of these visits and the second cohort of houses will have 1 year of these follow up visits . At these visits, a serum specimen will be collected from each individual . This specimen will be tested for influenza and RSV serology . During at least one of the visit HIV testing will be offered to those consenting individuals who previously tested HIV negative (there will be an open opportunity to test for HIV at each contact with the household to encourage people to test and access care) . In addition, a TST will be performed during the February and October visit on those who tested negative on TST previously . In addition, we will ask the questions in Questionnaire 2 , 3 and 8 (household enrolment form and case intake form and tuberculosis form) again. 10.6.9. Data and specimen collection Household visits will be performed by teams of an enrolled nurse who may be accompa nied by a field worker. All specimen collection and medical investigations, specifically, nasopharyngeal swabs, b lood specimens , sputum specimen collection and performance of tuberculin sk in tests will be performed by a nurse. All staff will be fully train ed in collection of specimens and data. Details of procedures for specimen and data collection are described below. 10.7. Data collection 10.7.1. Questionnaires The demographic characteristic s of the households will be collected on enrollment by structured interview conducted by trained field worker s. During each visit the development of symptoms (using a severity score) and healthcare -seeking behavior of symptomatic cases will be recorded. For each symptomatic case a structured interview will be done to assess duration and severity of symptoms. The questionnaires are included in Appendix 2 , updated forms are attached as additional submi ssions as per the covering letter . This is due to the size and format of the download from the REDcap database. 10.7.2. Household contact data collectio n We will collect information on contact patterns between individuals. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 31 We will conduct a pilot study in 5 househ olds at each study site for 4 weeks. The households will be selected randomly and approached to participate in the pilot study. Each household member will be asked to wear a tag (described in detail below) for 1 month (see image in Appendix 6 ). In order fo r a household to be eligible to participate in the pilot study at least 80% of household members must be willing to wear the tag. For the pilot study the tags will be packaged in waterproof cloth pouches which can be carried in the chest pocket or pinned t o the inside of clothes using a safety pin. During the pilot we will explore the acceptability of this packaging and obtain input on any possible improvements. In 201 8, all participating households will be approached to participate in the household contact study. All household members will be asked to wear the device for 8 - 12 days (depending on the exact day the tag can be issued to each participant and recollected), every 4 - 6 weeks to capture information for the different seasons (summer, autumn, winte r and spring) and to capture information in and out of the school holidays . To identify the location of contacts between household members within the home, tags will be placed in key locations within the houses (for example kitchen, living room, and bedroo ms). During deployment, participants will be asked to complete a time sheet (Appendix 6) to indicate during what periods the tag was not worn. To enable participants to record this information, each household will be supplied with one digital clock. This c lock will stay with the household after the study is completed. To measure contacts of participants of the study outside houses, participants will be asked to complete a contact diary and time use data questionnaire collecting information on the number of contacts per day, the age of the individual whom there was contact with and where the contact took place . In addition, all household members will be asked to complete a questionnaire on their time use and social contacts two times per year. Household members will be eligible to participate in the main study even if they refuse to participate in the contact study. Data collection infrastructure and type The tags detect dyadic close proximity interactions between individuals separated by 1.5 metres (or other customized distance), suggestive of a conversation or skin -to-skin touch such as a handshake. The tags are considered to be in proximity when at least one data packet (device ID, timestamp, power level) was exchanged between them during a 20 second i nterval. A 20 -second gap indicated a contact break. The tag will be worn as in the pilot if found to be acceptable to the community. Only face -to-face proximity relations will be detected since the radiofrequency used cannot propagate through the human bod y. For each deployment, field workers will issue each participating household member with a tag. Fieldworkers will ensure participants are properly trained on carriage and storage of devices. During the data collection with the devices, trouble -shooting an d mitigation according to laid down SOPs will be conducted. The head of the household will also be asked to ensure that correct use of the devices is maintained throughout the study. At the end of each deployment period, fieldworkers will collect all the t ags from participants and ship the se to NICD where data retrieval will take place. After the data is downloaded , the tags will be shipped back to the sites where fieldworkers will issue them back to participants for the next deployment. Community engageme nt and consent A community engagement plan will be developed in consultation with site partners, including relevant stakeholders. The household head will be requested to assent to engaging the rest of the household. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 32 Other residents will provide individual informed consent or assent as appropriate. Joint feedback meetings with study participants and other stakeholders will be organized per site in consultation with the site teams. General results of the study and experiences will be presented and discussed. The study progress and findings will also be discussed at local and international scientific meetings, and published in peer -reviewed journals as appropriate. 10.8. Specimen collection Respiratory pathogen diagnosis depends on the collection of high -quality spe cimens, their rapid transport to the laboratory and appropriate storage before laboratory testing. Viruses and bacteria are best detected in specimens containing infected cells and secretions. In addition, it is important for samples for tuberculosis diagn osis as well as blood specimens for serology to be transported to the laboratory as soon as possible and cold chain maintained as delays in the transportation increase the number of contaminating bacteria and this may result in higher percentage of contami nated cultures. Specific procedures for the collection of specimens are described in Appendix 1. Sampling from the respiratory tract is hazardous due to the generation of aerosols and droplets. Standard precautions should always be followed, and barrier protections applied whenever samples are obtained from patients. Respiratory samples ( oropharyngeal ( OP) swabs , nasophryngeal ( NP) swabs and expectorated sputum) from pneumonia cases should be collected wearing disposable gloves and N95 particulate respira tor mask. All human biological materials collected as part of this protocol will be used only for the study described in this protocol. A table summarizing the types of specimens to be collecting and testing to be done is included (Table 1).

Blood will be taken by a trained nurse. We will collect 1 ml of blood from children aged <15 years and 5ml from individuals aged 15 years. 10.8.4. Nasopharyngeal swabs for identification of respiratory pathogens Nasopharyngeal flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) will be collected twice weekly and inserted into Primestore medium. Procedures for collection are described in Appendix 1 Section 2 . 10.8.5. Oropharyngeal swabs for identification respiratory pathogens Oropharyngeal flocked swa bs (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) will be collected once -off in July and inserted into Primestore medium. Procedures for collection are described in Appendix 1 Section 2 . 10.8.6. Sputum samples for tuberculosis testing Sputum samples will be collected at baseli ne and thereafter from any individual with tuberculosis symptoms and placed into a universal container . Procedures for collection are described in Appendix 1 Section 5 . 10.8.7. Urine samples for cotinine testing Urine samples at baseline will be collected from all individuals who are able to produce a urine specimen quantitative urine cotinine levels. Procedures for collection are described in Appendix 1 Section 4 . 10.9. Specimen labeling The collection containers will be marked with: The unique identifier Visit number The specimen date The type of specimen in the tube (e.g. nasopharyngeal swab) Note: The tube/ universal container itself and not the cap should always be marked with identifying details. An indelible and alcohol resistant marker should be used as stick on labels can easily come off, especially when the specimens are chilled. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 35 As soon as the specimens are collected, the relevant information should be recorded on the Laboratory Specimen Submission Form (Appe ndix 2 Form 11 ). 10.10. Specimen transport and storage 10.10.1. Nasopharyngeal specimens Specimens should be inserted into Primestore and can be stored for up to 30 days at ambient temperature (2-30C). Specimens will be transported to the NICD for testing on a weekly basis. Specimen aliquots will be stored in a -70 deg C freezer until testing . 10.10.2. Oropharyngeal specimens OP swabs will be placed in Amies Transport medium and submitted to the laboratory within 72 hours of collection . 10.10.3. Blood samples Clotted blood samples collected in vacutainer tubes should be kept refrigerated (4\u00b0C) and should be transported as soon as possible to the laboratory on ice along with the laboratory slip. Site laboratories will spin the blood at 1000g for 10 minutes, keep tubes upright after centrifugation and ship in that manner to NICD. ETDA /heparin samples will be collected for CD4 and viral load testing, these will be shipped immediately to Lancet laboratories in either Hazyview or Klerksdorp for testing. 1.1.1. Sputum and urine samples Sputum and urine samples should be collected in universal containers and transported on ice to the laboratory for testing 1.1.2. Packaging and transport Detailed information about packing/transporting specimen s can be found in Appendix 4. Specimens will be transported in sealed plastic bags. Blood and sputum specimens must be kept cold during transport and a cooler box filled with ice packs can be used for this purpose. 10.11. Laboratory methods 10.11.1. PCR testing for respiratory viruses Nucleic acids will be extracted from Primestore medium using the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid small volume kit. Upper respiratory tract samples will be tested for RSV and influenza A and B viruses by real - time RTPCR using the FTD Flu/RSV detection assay (Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg). Influenza A and B positive samples will be subtyped using the CDC influenza influenza A (H1/H3/H1pdm09) subtyping and the CDC B/Yamagata - B/Victoria lineage typing kits respect ively (available through Influenza Reagent Resource Program; www.influenzareagentresource.org ) RSV A and also determined by real-time RTPCR . Additional will be determined using real time RTPCR. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 36 10.11.2. PCR and culture testing for respiratory bacteria 10.11.2.1. Detection and quantification of S. pneumoniae in nasopharyngeal swabs S. pneumoniae will be detected using a single -target ( lytA) quantitative real -time PCR assay [90]. Samples with a cycle threshold (C t) value of 40 w ill be recorded as negative. A standard curve will be prepared using se rially diluted DNA extracts from a known quantity (confirmed spectrophotometrically) of S. pneumoniae ATCC49619, and used to calculate pneumococcal (genomic copies/ml). 10.11.2.2. Detection of S. pneumoniae in EDTA blood specimens Total nucleic acids will be e xtracted using the Roche MagNA Pure 96 instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and tested for the pneumococcus using a single - target ( lytA) quantitative real -time PCR assay [90]. Samples with a cycle threshold (C t) value of 40 will be recorded as negative. 10.11.2.3. Detection of N. meningiti dis by PCR N. meningitis will be detected by a singleple x real -time PCR assay targeting the sodC gene, which will enable the detection of groupable and non -groupable meningococci [91]. Specimens testing positive for meningococcus will be serogrouped using a previously described method which enables the identification of serogroups A,B,C,W,X and Y [92]. 10.11.2.4. Detection of Bordetella spp. by PCR Bordetella spp. (including B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, B. bronchiseptica and B. holmesii ) will be detected by a combination of a triplex and singleplex real -time PCR Detection of C. diphtheriae by PCR C. diphtheriae will be detected by targeting the rpoB gene, and toxigenic strains identified by the detection of the tox gene [94]. 10.11.2.6. Detection of C. diphtheriae and N. meningiti dis by culture Each swab will be removed from Amies transport medium on arrival in the laboratory and used to inoculate the following 3 agar plates: 5% horse blood agar, New York City agar (NYC) and Hoyles and the plated out for single colonies. The blood and NYC plates will be incubated in CO 2 at 37oC and the Hoyles in O 2 at 37oC. Plates will be examined the next day for the presence of suspicious colonies, and re - incubated a further 24 hours . Suspicious colonies of N. meningitidis and C. diphtheriae will be picked off and sub cultured to confirm identity using standard laboratory methods . Serogroups of N. meningitidis isolates will be determined phenotypically using latex slide agglutination with antisera for capsular polysaccharides A, B, C, W, X, Y and Z. A subset of carriage isolates will be further characterised by whole genome sequencing at the NICD core sequencing f acility. Toxin production of C. diphtheriae isolates will be determined using standard laboratory methods 10.11.2.7. Detection of Group A streptococcus by PCR and Culture Retrospectively all samples collected in 2016 and 2017 (from -70\u00b0C) will be thawed and a PCR assay performed on all of these to detect the spy-gene which is specific to Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS). For Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 37 all samples that are PCR positive for GAS, 100ul of the broth will be used to inoculate a blood agar pl ate for the isolation of GAS. Plates will be incubated in CO2 at 37\u00b0C overnight, and suspicious beta haemolytic colonies will be further tested to confirm their identification as GAS. Plates will be checked up to 72 hours before being discarded as GAS not isolated. Confirmed isolates will be submitted for whole genome sequencing and stored in skimmed milk in -70\u00b0C for any future work -ups. For the 2018 cohort; we will firstly attempt to isolate GAS by placing 100ul of the broth the swab was immersed in, onto blood agar plates. Plates will be incubated in CO2 at 37\u00b0C overnight, and suspicious beta haemolytic colonies will be further tested to confirm their identification as GAS. Plates will be checked up to 72 hours before being discarded as 'GAS not isolated' . Confirmed isolates will then be stored in skimmed milk in -70\u00b0C for any future work -ups, such as whole genome sequencing. A PCR assay will be performed on all of these samples to detect the spy-gene, specific to Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS). 10.11.2.8. Microbiome studies A subset of specimens will be selected for in -depth analysis of the composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiota. The 16S gene is a conserved gene with variable regions amongst bacteria, and therefore sequencing of this gene enables the detection o f all bacteria in the microbiota. Bacterial DNA will be extracted from nasopharyngeal specimens, quantified, and the 16S rRNA gene amplified and sequenced using next generation sequencing 96]. Sequences from the 16S rRNA V5 -V7 variable regions will be compared to a database of known microbial sequences to identify the microbes present. There will be no direct or intentional sequencing of human DNA, any residual human reads will be informatically filtered and discarded prior to analysis . 10.11.3. Serologic testing for immunologic response to influenza and RSV Blood samples will be tested for rise in RSV or influenza antibody titres. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays will performed to determine serological reactivity titres f or serum samples against reference influenza virus antigens based on the selected vaccine strains and strains predominantly circulating in South Africa during each year. Turkey red blood cells will be used as indicator in the HAI assay. The protocol will b e based on the method described by Rowe et al. (1999) [97]. RSV antibody titres will be pathogens 10.11.4.1. Serology for pertussis Serology for pertussis antibody will be perf ormed using the anti -Pertussis Toxin enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure recommended by CDC. This ELISA involves in -house coating of microtitre plates with antigen prior to incubation with serum (20 \u00b5l per well) and detection with enzyme - labelled anti -human IgG. 100 \u00b5l serum is the optimal serum volume per patient to allow for repeats. Relevant standards and controls will be ordered from the National Institute for Biological Standards (NIBSC) in the USA. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 38 10.11.4.2. Serology for diphtheria Serology f or diphtheria will be performed using one of two commercially available ELISA kits which detect either IgG against diph theria toxin (Virotech) 10ul patient serum is incubated with toxin in each well, followed by d etection with e nzyme labelled anti -human IgG. 100ul serum is optimal per test, to allow for repeats. Choice of ELISA kit will depend on kit validation results at the Centre for Vaccines and Immunology. 10.11.5. HIV testing All patients will be offered HIV testing a t the baseline visit and then 6 monthly for the first year for individuals testing HIV -negative at the previous visit. For individuals in the first and second year of the study, patients will be offered HIV testing at an annual visit in October of each yea r. HIV status will be defined as follows: If the patient has a documented positive HIV result (or evidence of ART) available in the medical records they will be recorded as HIV positive. If the patient is not aware of their status or a previous result doc uments a negative result the patient will be offered voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) by Rapid HIV -antibody detection tests or by PCR assay from dried blood spots (tested at NICD) for patient under the age of 18 months. From consenting patients who do not want to have a rapid HIV test as described above, blood samples already collected for serologic testing will be also tested for HIV infection. Patients will be offered the option to receive their result if they would like to . A documented HIV negat ive status for the mother would be confirmation of negative status for a child under the age of 10 years . In order to define HIV exposure in infants, the mother's HIV status at the time of pregnancy will need to be defined; this information will be gained verbally from the mother and confirmed by the clinic/hospital records or the child's road to health card. If mother's HIV status is unknown she will be offered VCT and rapid HIV testing as described above. Patients not wanting to know their HIV status or unwilling to provide an anonymous sample may still be enrolled into the study. For HIV positive patients, a specimen for CD4 count will be collected if there is no recent documented CD4 count results (within 6 months of household enrolment ). Patients newl y diagnosed with HIV will be referred to the local clinic for assessment for initiation of antiretroviral therapy For all individuals who decline HIV testing, they will be encouraged to test at follow up visits and the benefits of knowing your status empha sized. 10.11.6. Testing for tuberculosis infection and disease 10.11.6.1. Performance of the TST The test is done by putting a small amount of tuberculosis protein (antigens) under the top layer of skin on the inner forearm. If an individual has ever been exposed to the tuberculosis bacteria ( M.tuberculosis ), their skin will react to the antigens by developing a firm red bump at the site within 2 days. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 39 Specifically, a standard dose of 5 tuberculin units (TU) is injected intradermally to raise a wheal or bleb about 6mm in diameter in the longitudinal axis on the volar surface of the forearm and read 48 -72 hours later. Reading is done by measuring the indurated area - not only the reddened area - i.e. it must be raised from surrounding skin. It is measured transversely using calipers with the ruler/reading face down to avoid digit preference, then turned over once the desired distance is fixed. The ball -pen method can be sued to identify edges of the indurated area. 10.11.6.2. Tuberculosis culture Baseline specimens collected from all patients will be cultured for detection of M. tuberculosis . Sputum samples will be digested and decontaminated. Following decontamination, 0.5mls of the sediment inoculated into a Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) tube for culture and isolation of Mycobacteria in the BACTEC MGIT 960 instrument as per manufacturer's instructions. The primary isolation of mycobacterium will be done using the N -Acetyl L -Cysteine hydroxide the MGIT will be placed in the BACTEC 960 instrument and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius. Cultures will be reported as negative if no growth has been observed in 42 days. When a MGIT tube \"flags\" positive, a smear will be assessed for acid -fast bacilli (AFB). If A FB are observed microscopically, then identification will be done using the MDRTB plus Line Probe Assay for AFB positives. This assay will confirm the presence of M. tuberculosis complex and report isoniazid and rifampicin resistance. If the MDRTB plus fai ls to demonstrate M. tuberculosis complex, despite the presence of acid fast bacilli on the Ziehl Neelsen stain, further species identification may be performed using the Mycobacterium CM/AS Line Probe Assay. 10.11.6.3. Testing for tuberculosis using Gene Xpert Mtube rculosis/RIF Specimens in symptomatic patients identified on monthly follow -up symptom questionaires will be tested using Gene Xpert Mtuberculosis/RIF . The Xpert Mtuberculosis/RIF is based on the GeneXpert platform, a sensitive, rapid and simple test targeted nucleic acid sequences in the tuberculosis genome, and provides results from unprocessed sputum samples within 100 minutes. The Mtuberculosis Xpert/RIF detects M. tuberculosis as well as rifampicin resistance - conferring mutations directly from sputum. 10.11.7. Urine cotinine testing Cotinine is an alkaloid found in tobacco and is also the predominant metabolite of nicotine . Cotinine is used as a biomarker for exposure to tobacco smoke. Cotinine has an in vivo half -life of approximately 20 hours, and is typically detectable fo r several days (up to one week) after the use of tobacco. The level of cotinine in the blood, saliva, and urine is proportionate to the amount of exposure to tobacco smoke, so it is a valuable indicator of tobacco smoke exposure, including secondary (passi ve) smoke. In urine, values between 11 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL may be associated with light smoking or passive exposure, and levels in active smokers typically reach 500 ng/mL or more. Cotinine assays provide an objective quantitative measure that is more relia ble than smoking histories or counting the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Cotinine also permits the measurement of exposure to second -hand smoke (passive smoking). Drug tests can detect cotinine in the blood, urine, or saliva. Urine cotinine concentr ations average fourfold to sixfold higher than those in blood or saliva, making urine a more sensitive matrix to detect low - concentration exposure. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 40 10.11.8. Organism characterisation 10.11.8.1. Respiratory virus characterization and evolution Identified clusters of influenza viruses and RSV in households will be investigated using molecular methods to determine the diversity of virus strains circulating within a household by using heteroduplex mobility assays to identify single strand conformational polymorphisms [100]. Sequencing of influenza A and B viruses will be done after cDNA synthesis and PCR HA gene segments or comp lete genomes using One - step SuperScript system (Invitrogen, USA)[101, 102].The R SV F gene be amplified and sequenced as described previously [99]. Amplicons will be sequenced using the BigDye Terminator sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) whereas genome sequencing will be performed on the Illumina MiSeq next generatio n sequencing platform. Multiple sequence alignment of nucleotide sequences will be done using ClustalW algorithm embedded in BioEdit v7.0.9.1. Phylogenetic analysis will be performed on codon aligned sequences with MEGA 5.2 program [103] employing a Hasegawa -Kishino - Yano (HKY) substitution and Gamma site heterogeneity models as inferred by the data. Tree topologies and robustness will be assessed by bootstrap analysis using 100 -1,000 replicates dep ending on whether maximum likelihood or neighbour -joining tree drawing methods are used. Representative reference sequences of relevant viral strains will be retrieved from international sequence databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ ). To determine antigenic characteristics of RSV strains the F protein gene sequences will be analysed to identify polymorphisms in epitopic regions identified as vaccine targets and antibody -based interventions. Additionally, samples will be shipped to the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) in the United States of America, for next generation sequencing of Influenza and RSV viruses. Influenza -positive samples may also be shared with the World Health Organization Collab orating Centres as part of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response Network. 10.11.8.2. Pneumococc al serotyping LytA-positive specimens with a Ct a PCR assay described by Pimenta et al.[104]. 10.12. Patient compensation for household visits Each participant will be compensated for the time commitment involved in this i ntensive study. Each participant will be compensated for each study visit with a voucher for the local supermarket to the value of R25. An additional voucher will be issued to each participant upon return a proximity tag with no visible physical damage aft er each deployment. During the environmental sampling, an additional R50 electricity voucher will be provided per device placed in the household to cover electricity usage of the device. 10.13. Procedures for case enrolment and c onsent Cases will be identified through stratified r andom sampling as described in S ection 10.5 . The purpose of the study will be explained to all household members in English or the local languages (as per the preference of the participant). In addition , a printed study information shee t will be provided in English and appropriate local languages for participants to read. Participants aged 18 years and older will be asked to give written consent. For participant s younger than 18 years of age the parent/guardian/primary caregiver will provide for written consent for the child. Assent will be obtained from children between 7 years and 17 years by a similar process. If an individual agrees to participate but is unable to sign, a thumbprint will serve in place of a signature, and an impartia l household member will sign as a witness. Consent to continue in the study will be obtained verbally at all follow up visits. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 41 Consent an d assent forms can be found in A ppendix 5. 10.14. Ethical approval Ethical approval for the study will be obtained from the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) . The protocol will be submitted for a reliance from the US CDC ethics committee. 10.15. Referral to health services If any household contact with ILI /ARI symptoms are identified that should se ek medical attention, they will be referred to the relevant clinic. Patients with suspected tuberculosis will be offered tuberculosis testing by GeneXpert M tuberculosis Rif and referred to the local clinic /hospital if indicated clinically or they test tube rculosis positive . Patients requiring hospitalization for respiratory illness will be referred to pneumonia surveillance hospitals (Matikwana and Mapulaneng in Mpumalanga and Kle rksdorp and Tshepong in Northwest Province) and enrolled into the NICD pneumon ia surveillance programme (Wits HREC Protocol number M140824 ). Patients with newly -diagnosed HIV infection will be referred to the local clinic for assessment for antiretroviral treatment including CD4+ T cell count testing . 10.16. Prevention of influenza and other infections in front line staff Front -line staff including study nurses will be trained in infection control procedures including proper hand hygiene and the correct use of surgical face masks, not only to minimize their own risk of infection when in close contact with patients during home visits and elsewhere, but also to minimize the risk of the nurses acting as a vector of infection between household members or between households. They will also be offered influenza vaccination prior to influenz a season each year . Staff will be properly trained in collection of blood specimens and disposal of sharps. Staff will be encouraged to stay home from work and practice good respiratory hygiene and handwashing if they have any respiratory illness. A nasoph aryngeal swab will be collected from all field workers on a weekly basis and tested for influenza, RSV and pertussis to document possible infection transmission to and by fieldworkers. 10.17.

Data management All data gathered during household enrollment, first study visit, follow -up visits and quarterly visits will be collected electronically during each household visit and uploaded directly to the REDcap server at Wits on the mobile data collection system REDcap . This will include information on household demographic, sign and symptoms, contact patterns among household members, sample collection and selected laboratory results (e.g. tuberculin skin and HIV testing results). A unique identifier including household , household member and a follow -up visit identifiers will be used for each household visit. The database will be password protected to ensure that outside parties will not have access to the database. The database will be backed up daily. A data quality/da ta verification process will be developed and will be implemented by a study manager and a database manager at site. This will include verification of completeness and accuracy of collected data. A study log will be maintained by study staff and compared w ith a pre - established study calendar to assess concordance of study implementation with study procedures. NICD will access the database on a daily basis to check on follow up progress and data quality. Data quality and completeness will be again evaluated at NICD by a dedicated data manager. Laboratory results will be entered into the same data system (REDcap) which will be stored on the REDcap server at Wits . Each sample will be identified by the same identifier allocated to each individual household membe r (including the follow -up visit identifier) and, after data quality verification, linked monthly with the central database encompassing data collected at sites. Participant names and study identifiers will be captured in a separate table at the start of the study. All patients will be allocated a unique study number which will be used for all study information and specimen labelling . Patient identifiers will be kept in a separate database which will be hidden to data entry staff. Patient identifier data m ay be accessed by laboratory staff for the purposes of laboratory reporting of diseases which require patient treatment or public health action for example positive results for tuberculosis. No personal identification will be displayed in any reports or co mmunication regarding this investigation. All study data will be archived electronically on the REDcap server at Wits, which has additional back up. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 43 10.18.1. Data management for the household contact study 10.18.1.1. Data Storage Data collected by the wearable devices will b e stored internally and extracted using cables. Data from the devices will be downloaded into a MySQL database. Anonymised raw data, log files and analysis code will be archived in the NICD servers by the Project Data Manager after analysis. 10.18.1.2. Data analysis Characterizing contacts : Patterns of contact will be described using several quantities that quantify the number of unique individuals contacted (degree), number of contacts between individuals (frequency), the duration of these contacts (weight) and the cumulative time spent in contact by each pair of individuals. The statistical distribution and variations will also be assessed. Heterogeneity of the contacts and their statistical distributions will be assessed across six key variables: demography, tempor ality, grade, role and setting. Analysis will be conducted using R and Python. Characterizing networks and community interactions : To describe the characteristics of networks and community interactions, network data analysis and visualization will be aggre gated at the household level. Temporal data will be aggregated hourly, daily and over the entire duration of study. Networks will be stratified by the covariates (demography, grade, role, setting). Nodes and edges will represent individuals within the stra tum and the occurrence of a contact between the nodes, respectively. Results obtained from this descriptive analysis will be used to determine the appropriate statistical network model to be used to better understand the heterogeneities affecting the obser ved network structure. This will also provide household -based mixing parameters to be used in a transmission model. Network and Transmission models : The transmission model will investigate the role of mixing between and within households and schools on th e risk of an epidemic. The network model will investigate the impact on transmission dynamics of key features identified from the household and school socio - behavioural structure. This will be undertaken to establish which quantities appear to have dominan t impact on transmission rates and patterns and intervention impact on common respiratory infections such as respiratory syncytial virus. 10.19. Variables 10.19.1. Main outcomes of interest for the primary study objective The main outcomes of interest, will be as follows : Laboratory -confirmed influenza -infection on PCR on PCR or serology Consultation with a primary care provider Proportion of laboratory -confirmed influenza and RSV infections that are sym ptomatic 10.19.2.

Type of residential dwelling categories include: formal house/apartment, in formal dwelling, traditional house or l/ Overcrowding in residences: this will be assessed by determining number of people residing in the household, as well as the number of rooms in the household (excluding bathrooms and kitchen). An index of number of p eople per room will be used to assess impact of crowding in the household. We will also assess the number of people sleeping in the same bedroom, as well as the number of children residing in the household. Cigarette smoke exposure: in children exposures t o passive smoking on history will be analyzed. Passive smoking will be defined as a participant who resides in a household where there is active smoking indoors and/or where they are exposed to an indoor cigarette smoking environment (other than their resi dence) for more than three hours every week. For adults and teenagers a detailed smoking history will be taken and smoke exposure will also be assessed on urine cotinine testing Exposure to smoke in the household from indoor fires - this will be assessed o n history as well as using objective measures of indoor air pollution Education level: the highest level of education for each participant will be determined. This will be analysed according to whether the caregiver achieved a primary, secondary or tertiary level of education. Socioeconomic status: various tools will be used and adapted to determine the socioeconomic status of participants. Items used by the World Bank in the Demographic Health Survey Wealth Index as well as those used in the Agincou rt Health and Demographic Surveillance System Asset Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 45 status module57 will be included in the questionnaire.

Household level exposures Temperature Humidity Indoor air pollution 10.20. Statistical analysis 10.20.1. Estimation of the community burden of influenza, RSV, B. pertussis, and M. tuberculosis infection Incidence of RSV, influenza virus and pertussis infection within age groups and HIV infection status will be estimated using serological and PCR data. Inciden ce obtained from the study subjects will be standardized to the demographic characteristic of the study sites to account for potential differences between the selected households and the population. The symptomatic fraction will be expressed as the proport ion of RSV, influenza or pertussis positive cases that developed symptoms. Severity of symptoms will be assessed over a pre -established scale and analyzed using ordinal regression (proportional odd model) to discriminate between severe and mild disease. In addition, the proportion of individuals that were Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 46 hospitalized or died will be reported. The healthcare seeking behavior among the symptomatic patients will be assessed. The annual and quarterly incidence of tuberculosis infection and symptomatic disease will be estimated using tuberculin skin test and sputum results, respectively. 10.20.2. Estimation of the prevalence of meningococcal , diphtheria and GAS carriage and HIV infection The prevalence of meningococcal , GAS and diphtheria carriage within age groups and HIV infection status groups will be estimated using data from PCR and culture testing performed annually. The prevalence of HIV infection in the study population will be assessed at baseline and re -evaluated quarterly. 10.20.3. Estimation of the transmission dynamics of influenza virus, RSV, S. pneumoniae and B. pertussis in the community The incidence of infection/colonization of PCR confirmed cases will be estimated for each of the selected pathogens. The SIR for each pathogen will be evaluated among all household in which at least one household member tested positive by PCR for one of the selected pathogens and the index case was identified during the study period. The latter would be particularly relevant for S. pneumoniae given its high colonization rates and its prolonged colonization time. The SIR will be expressed as the proportion of infected individuals divided by the individuals at risk excluding the index case. The serial interval in the transmission chain will be expr essed as the time of symptoms onset of the index case to the time of symptom onset of secondary cases within the household. A metapopulation transmission model will be developed for each pathogen to assess the characteristics of the individuals serving as the most likely source of infection/colonization for the household as well as the transmission dynamics of infection/colonization when the pathogen is introduced in the household. For each pathogen the intensity of the transmission will be assessed throu gh the estimation of the effective reproductive number ( Rt) and it's variation over time. A similar analysis will be implemented for the other respiratory viruses evaluated in the study. 10.20.4. Estimation of determinant of transmission within household For each pathogen factors associated with risk of infection will be assessed using unconditional logistic regression and survival analysis. Predictors will include individual and household level demographic characteristics, co -infection (or preceding infection) wit h other respiratory pathogens, co -morbidities (including HIV infection) as well as environmental and behavioral factors. A sub -analysis will be implemented to asses factors associated with high pneumococcal colonization density in the community. 10.20.5. Estimation of the prevalence of immunity to and recent infection with C. diphtheria e and B. pertussis Baseline immunity levels for each individual will be studied by quantitating IgG to diphtheria and pertussis at the start of the study period, which will give an in dication of immunity due either to natural infection or prior vaccination, and compared to immunity at the end of the study period. New seroconverters who Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 47 become IgG positive and any future timepoint will be an indication of actively circulating infection during the study period. Such results will be compared with symptoms reported and molecular results obtained from swabs during the same period. 10.21. Personnel, training and supervision Surveillance staff (registered nurses, enrolled nurses, and /or research assi stants/counsellors) will be employed at each proposed study site to assist with patient enrolment, sampling and completing questionnaires . All nurses and research assistants/counsellors will be trained in obtaining consent, completing study forms and HIV p re-and post -test counseling. The nurses will be trained in taking adequate samples . Each study site will have a study co-ordinator who will be responsible for on -site supervision of day -to- day activities of the s tudy team . The site co -ordinator and database manager/epidemiologist will monitor the forms submitted and review a subset of forms for completeness and consistency of data on a regular basis. Staff from NICD will visit the surveillance sites regularly to evaluate s urveillance officer performance and overall site performance. 10.22. Monitoring and evaluation Performance indicators will be developed for : Questio nnaire completion e.g. number of fields completed, inconsistencies in data, visits with missing forms Completeness of visits - completeness of household visits including specimen collection and forms Specimen submission - numbers of cases with no specimens submitted, specimen labeling Data entry - consistency checks, lag in data entry etc. Laboratory indicators - time taken to transport specimens to laboratory, turn -around -time for results 10.23. Pilot study A pilot study will be performed in November -December 2015. This will involve identifying pilot households, taking them through the informed consent process , also piloting data collection tools and specimen collection. Based on the findings of the pilot study, study tools and procedures will be amended. 10.24. Study limitations The limitation s of this study pertain mainly to the implementation of the study at two s elected sites, which may hinder the generali sability of the study results to other areas or settings. In addition, we may have limited power to accurately assess the selected endpoints for pathogens expected to be found at low prevalence in the community s uch as N. meningitidis and C. diphtheriae . 10.25. Dissemination and publication of results Finding of the study will be summarized in annual reports to all investigators. Study findings will be published in the peer -reviewed literature. The first draft of the mai n manuscripts will be complete in June 2019 and the final version in December 2019.

Oropharyngeal (OP) swabs (throat swabs) Hold the tongue down with a tongue depressor Have the patient say \"aahh\" to elevate the uvula Use a sweeping motion to swab the posterior pharyngeal wall and tonsilar pillars. Avoid swabbing the soft plate and do not touch the tongue with the swab tip.(This procedure can induce the gag reflex) Put the swab into a collection container with viral tr ansport medium (VTM ) Figure 1: Oropharyngeal (OP) swab 2. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab A flexible, fine -shafted flocked swab is inserted into the nostril and back to t he nasopharynx until a slight resistance is met the swab is rotated two to three times and held in place for 5 seconds to ensure maximum absorbency. It is then slowly withdrawn with a rotating motion and placed in VTM. The tip of the swab is put into a via l containing 2 -3 ml of virus transport medium and the plastic shaft is broken at the break point line so that it can fit in the VTM, taking care not to touch the tip. The NP swab can be put in the same container as the OP swab. Place the specimens on ice in laboratory cooler box. Complete the lab requisition forms/lab slip Note: Nasopharyngeal swabbing is an invasive process that can cause considerable distress to the patient. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 56 Figure 2: Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab 3. Blood specimens Specimens will be collected using the vacutainer collection system, as follows (see Figure 3): By twisting, remove the bottom white cap (D) of the needle. Now, firmly screw the needle in the needle holder/barrel (B). Remove the top cap (C) to ready the needle (A) for use just before the sample is taken. Figure 3: The Vacutainer Needle & Barrel System Apply the tourniquet to the patient's arm (a) and disinfect the site of venepuncture (see Figure 4). Hold the needle holder between thumb and index finger of the right hand and insert into the vein (b). Now change the position of the hand i.e. fixes the n eedle holder on the patient's arm with the thumb and index finger of the left hand. The left hand now serves to keep the needle Immobilized in the vein during the different actions. Position the first tube in the holder and press it onto the needle to all ow the tube to fill (c). (C) (D) (B)(A) Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 57 (a) (b) (c) Figure 4: Collecting the Sample Fill the tube and remove once full. Release the tourniquet then remove the needle from the patients arm and immediately apply pressure to the venipuncture site. Firm pr essure at this time will minimize bruising and therefore discomfort and distress to the patient. Ask the patient to take over applying pressure to the site. If collecting blood in EDTA: Invert the ETDA, purple topped, tube gently 6 to 8 times (see Figure 5) Figure 5: Inverting the ETDA Check that all the barcodes match and that you have marked the t ube with the patient's unique bar coded study number. (d) invert 6 -8 times Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 58 Blood collection for infants and young children Use a winged 23 gauge needle, with a butterfly. Avoid gauge 25 gauge because these may cause haemolysis. Use a butterfly with either a syringe or an evacuated tube with an adaptor that has a barrel volume of 1 -5 mls depending on collection needs. 4. Urine Samples This sample must be collected for all patients who are able to provide a specimen . For these you will need the universal container (clear plas tic bottle with a green lid). Ask the patient to pass a fresh urine specimen into the universal container. Label the universal container with a unique identifier/bar code ID (NB label the container and not the lid). Quantitative testing for coltinine will be done at the Lancet laboratory in Cape Town 5. Expectorated sputum The optimum time for sputum collection is first thing in the morning but it can be collected anytime of the day. This sample must be collected for patients > 5 years if able to expectorate. Ask the patient to gargle with water to rinse out the mouth. Brushing of teeth or rinsing the mouth thoroughly will reduce contamination. Instruct the patient to take a deep breath through the mouth and try to cough up mucous from deep in the chest. Patie nt may have to take several deep breaths and cough a lot in order to get adequate sputum. Specimen should be a deep cough specimen and not saliva. Patient must open the universal container and hold it close to the mouth, spit mucous into the container, wit hout getting any of the mucous on the outside of the container. Patient must screw the lid of the container tightly, so that it does not leak.

Assessment of levels of exposure to particulate matter Levels of exposure to particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) will be measured through the installation of portable, constant flow Gilian pumps with Dorr -Oliver cyclones as pre -separator with mixed cellulose ester filters in line. Filters will be dehydrated for 24 hours and pre -weighed using a micro -balance under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Each filter will be assigned a unique identification number and weighed thrice. After weighing, the filter will be placed in a sealed cassette and stored in a temperature controlled envir onment prior to transportation to the field sites. In the field the cassette (containing the cyclone) will be inserted into the cyclone separator and attached to a Gilian pump. Pumps with cyclones will be located at the breathing height of adults. Sampling will be undertaken at a flow rate of 1.7 litres per minute. The time of switching the pump on and off (24 hours later) will be recorded. In 10% of dwellings a filter, unattached to a Gilian pump, will be installed to determine whether factors unrelated to respirable particles are influencing readings. Each Gilian pump will be serviced and calibrated beforehand. Cassettes containing filters will be sealed after sampling and carefully stored and transported to the laboratory for dehydration and weighing. A smaller version of this device will be worn by one member of each household during the environmental sampling period to monitor personal air quality. This device will have a GPS logger attached to it in order to monitor the area where the air sample was collected. 2. Assessment of exposure to carbon monoxide ChromAir badges will be used to monitor exposure to carbon monoxide, either personally or an area within the dwelling. The carbon monoxide monitors are non -invasive and are placed on top of clothing worn by the participant. After purchase, the badges will be kept under refrigeration. In the field, before monitoring starts, all pertinent information will be entered on the I .D. label. After removing the protective strip, the badged will be attached to the participant's breathing zone (for personal monitoring) or placed in a suitable location in the dwelling. The results will be read and interpreted in line with the manufactur er's guidelines. 3. Assessment of exposure to dust Dust within a pre -determined area of the floor will be collected using a ghost wipe. Sampling and analysis of dust samples will be conducted using US EPA/HUD methods. 4. Assessment of indoor temperature and rel ative humidity Battery operated LogTag, Haxo -8 indoor temperature monitors will be placed in all dwellings to monitor indoor air temperature and relative humidity over a period of one year. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 86 Appendix 4: Specimen packaging and transport protocol Transport of specimens should comply with WHO Guidance on regulations for the Transport of Infectious Substances (WHO/CDS/EPR/207.2), applicable from 1 January 2007. The receiving laboratory should be notified before shipment of specimens. All specimens to b e transported must be packed in packaging consisting of three layers. These consist of the following (Figure 6): Primary receptacle: A primary watertight, leak -proof receptacle containing the specimen. The receptacle is packaged with enough absorbent mater ial to absorb all fluid in case of breakage. Secondary packaging: A second durable, watertight, leak -proof packaging to enclose and protect the primary receptacle(s). Several primary receptacles may be placed in one secondary packaging, but these must eit her be individually wrapped or separated so as to prevent contact between them. Sufficient additional absorbent material must be used to absorb all fluid in case of breakage. Outer packaging: Secondary packagings are placed in outer shipping packaging with suitable cushioning material. Outer packaging protect their contents from outside influences, such as physical damage, while in transit. The smallest overall external dimension shall be 10x10 cm. Each completed package is required to be correctly marked a nd labelled with the receiver's (consignee's) name, address and telephone number. The specimens are transported as Biological Substances, Category B. These are classified as infectious substances that are not in a form generally capable of causing permanent disability or life -threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposed to it. This includes substances transported for diagnostic or investigational purposes. The label UN3373 (Figure 7) is not necessary when transpor ting Category B substances by road.

Investigator: Prof Cheryl Cohen 011 386 6593, day time and 082 803 8093, afterhours Hello, my name is Prof Cheryl Cohen, I am the Head of the Centre for Respiratory Disease and Meningitis at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg. I would like to invite you to think about helping us with a research study called the household transmission study. Before you agree to take part in this study we would like you to read this information sheet about the study. Before you say you would like to take part please make sure you understand what you need to do. You should also make sure you understand the purpose of the study, the study procedures, benefits, risks, discomforts, and p recautions as well as the alternative procedures that are available to you, and your right to withdraw from the study at any time. This information leaflet is to help you to decide if you would like to participate. You need to understand what is involved b efore you agree to take part in this study. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask me or the study staff that will introduce the study to you. You should not agree to take part unless you are satisfied with all the procedures involved. Pleas e be open with me regarding your health history, since you may otherwise harm yourself by participating in this study. If you decide to take part in this study, you will be asked to sign this document to confirm that you understand the study. You will be g iven a copy to keep. Background/Purpose Updated 2018 consent forms on page 109Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 89 Infectious diseases are caused by different germs (virus, bacteria or parasites). By infectious we mean that the illness can be passed from one person to the next. It is important to understand the way these infecti ons are passed on to other people. The household (home) is an important place for transmission (passing on) of these infections because people spend time together in close contact. It is also possible that someone is infected with the virus or bacteria but does not become ill. It is important to understand the number of people who get infected and do not get ill. The information from the study will help to make guidelines for the use of vaccines and other interventions to help prevent these illnesses in peo ple. We are conducting a study to try and understand how infectious diseases are passed on in households. We are interested in viruses and bacteria that cause respiratory illness ( for example influenza and tuberculosis (TB)). We are also interested in the bacteria that causes meningitis called meningococcus. The names of all these germs are confusing so it is easier to group them into the germs that cause respiratory illness (colds, flu and pneumonia (chest infections)) and the germs that cause meningitis (infection in the brain). We know that some people are at risk of getting very severe forms of these illnesses, these groups include very young children, the elderly, people with other illnesses (like heart disease, diabetes and other lung conditions), and people who have weak immune systems (like people with HIV). We would like to know how these infections enter the household and then how they are passed on in the house. This is why we are doing this study in the household. There are important factors in households, including the compositions of the household (how many young children, children who go to school, people who work and people who stay in the household). There are also important factors like smoking and making of fires inside the house which als o play a role in the transmission of infections. In order to help us explain all these things we are planning a study that will enroll 100 household in the Bushbuckridge district and in Klerksdorp each year. Each household will be asked to be part of t he study for one year. During this year we will do a number of things after the household members have signed consent to participate, details of each of these procedure are outlined later in this form. 1. Complete a detailed questionnaire for each person in t he home including questions about your age, the kind of work you do, what illness you may have and some questions about your home (number of rooms, cooking etc). 2. We will ask about your HIV status and if necessary do testing for HIV. If you test positive fo r HIV we will counsel you and refer you for treatment. 3. We will take blood samples (10mls (two teaspoon) from adults and 5mls (one teaspoon) from children aged <15 years, at the beginning of the study and then three times during the year. These blood sample s will be tested for bacteria and viruses and for your bodies' reaction to these viruses. 4. In September we will take one additional blood sample which will be 1ml (less than one teaspoon) from children aged <15 years and 5mls (one teaspoon) from adults. The se blood samples will be tested for a particular bacterium, streptococcus, which causes pneumonia and meningitis. 5. Take a sputum sample at the beginning of the study, this sample will be tested for TB; if you test positive for TB we will refer you for trea tment. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 90 6. Each month we will ask you if you have any symptoms of TB and if you have these symptoms we will take a sputum specimen for TB testing. If you test positive for TB we will refer you for treatment. 7. At the beginning of the year and again at the end of the year we will to a skin test to check for TB infection 8. Take a urine sample at the beginning of the study. This urine sample will be tested for a chemical that tells us how much you smoke (this will not be done on children under 12 years of age). 9. At the enrolment visit and following that at the twice weekly household visit we will take a swab from each member of the household. At the follow up visits we will ask a few simple questions about any respiratory symptoms you may have experienced. These swabs will be tested for the germs that cause respiratory illness. If you have experienced/are experiencing any respiratory symptoms we can refer you for treatment. 10. Towards the middle of the year in July, we will take a throat swab; this swab will be tested fo r the bacteria that cause meningitis. 11. We will also ask if anyone has been in hospital or died. We will ask questions as about why they went to hospital and what they died from. 12. We will put a small machine in the house that will measure the temperature and humidity in your house. These machines are similar to a thermometer and will not interfere with your day to day activities. 13. At two points in the study (once in the summer months and once in the winter months) we will also put a machine in your house that measures the amount of carbon monoxide (smoke) in your home. These machines will not interfere with your day to day activities. 14. After the first year of the study is finished we will visit you at your house once a year for the next 2 year in October to take a blood sample of 5mls (one teaspoon) from children aged <15 years and 10mls (two teaspoon) from people aged 15 years, perform a tuberculosis test and perform an HIV test. Length of study and number of participants The study will be performed in South Af rica only. Approximately 1500 participants will participate in this study, 100 households each year with an average of 5 people in each household. Every household member, regardless of their age will be asked to participate. We will visit the household twi ce a week for the period of one year. After that we will visit the household once a year for a maximum of two years. Study procedures 1. Blood samples: Blood will be taken from your arm; this will be done by a trained nurse. 2. HIV testing a. If you are HIV-positive and have some way of showing us this, either by a clinic record or your ARV treatment we will not need to test you for HIV. b. We can do a rapid HIV test at your house by doing a small prick on your finger and you will be able to receive the resu lt immediately Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 91 c. We can also test the blood sample that we have taken at the beginning of the study or four times per year for HIV in the laboratory in Johannesburg. If you choose for us to do this we can still give you your results if you would like to know them 3. Naso -pharyngeal swab (swabs are like a long cotton bud), the nurse will put a swab into your nose until it touches the back of your throat. 4. Throat swabs. After asking you to open your mouth wide, the nurse will put the swab into the back of your mo uth and touch the back of your throat with the swab. 5. Sputum samples, we will ask you to cough into a small bottle. 6. Urine will be collected in a small bottle, the nurse will explain how to do this and you will collect the sample yourself in the bathroom. 7. Skin test for TB, the nurse will give you a very small injection into the skin with a very small needle, this may cause a slight swelling on your arm. After 2 to 3 days the nurse will come back to measure how big the swelling is. Your rights as a participant It is your right to choose if you want to take part in this study. If you chose not to participate this will not affect your right to health care, other services or your right to participate in future studies. Expected duration of participation The first visit will take about an hour per person including taking the blood samples; the follow -up visits will be about 15 minutes per person. We will try to arrange these visits when most people in the household are present and this may involve us visiting your household in the evening or over weekends. Risks of this study There is minimal risk to you in this study as we are only asking questions about your normal behaviour at home. You may find some of the questions uncomfortable. There may be minimal discomfor t when we take the nasopharyngeal or throat sample. Some people may gag when we take the sample, but the procedure only takes a few seconds. The TB skin test has a slight risk of discomfort and may result in slight swelling of the arm. Venipunctures (i.e. drawing blood) are normally done as part of routine medical care and present a slight risk of discomfort. Drawing blood may result in faintness, inflammation of the vein, pain, bruising or bleeding at the puncture site. There is also a slight possibility of infection. Your protection is that experienced personnel perform the procedures under sterile conditions. Testing for HIV may be stressful, we will have a trained counsellor to explain all about the test and what the results will mean to you. We will also refer you directly into the treatment programme if you do test positive for HIV. Benefits of this study By taking part in this study, you will help us learn more about how certain infectious diseases affect different people and who may benefit from va ccines. You will have a chance to get the results of your HIV and TB tests and if you test positive for these infectious you will get the benefit of early treatment. Community burden and transmission of influenza and RSV (PHIRST study) ammendment1 3 July2018 Page 92 Confidentiality Every effort will be made to protect your confidentiality: study forms and blood samples will be marked with a number and not a name. Study staff will keep a log of household members and identifying details of household members, these will be kept in secure locked offices. No reference to personal detail will be made in any stud y report or in the final results of the study. Withdrawal from the study Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you can decline to participate, or stop at any time, without stating any reason. Your withdrawal will not affect your acces s to other medical care. The investigators retain the right to withdraw you from the study if it is considered to be in your best interest. If you did not give an accurate history or did not follow the guidelines of the study and the regulations of the study facility, you may be withdrawn from the study at any time. Reimbursement for Participation You will not be paid to participate in this study. However we will offer you some reimbursement for the time and inconvenience of participating in this study. We will offer you a voucher to be redeemed at a supermarket for items sold at that supermarket. Each member of the household will receive a v oucher to the value of R25 for each of the visits. For a household of 5 people counting the twice weekly visits this would be in the region of R1000 worth of vouchers for an average month. The study will not pay for any care that you need for the any illn ess you may experience during this study. We will share the results of the HIV and TB tests with you so that you will know if you have been infected with these illnesses. In addition, we are able to refer you for medical help to your nearest clinic if this is necessary. Ethical approval This clinical study protocol has been submitted to the University of the Witwatersrand, Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) and written approval has been granted by that committee. The study has been structured in acco rdance with the Declaration of Helsinki (last updated: October 2013), which deals with the recommendations guiding doctors in biomedical research involving human participants.

If you decide to take part in this study, you will be asked to sign this document to confirm that you understand the study. You will be given a copy to keep. Background/Purpose Infectious diseases are caused by different germs ( virus , bacteria or parasites). By infectious we mean that the illness can be passed from one person to the next. It is important to understand the way these infections are passed on to other people. The household (home ) is an important place for transmission (passing on) of these infection s because people spend time together in close contact. It is also possible that someone is infected with the virus or bacteria but does not become ill. It is important to understand the number of people who get infected and do not get ill. The information from the study will help to make guidelines for the use of vaccines and other interventions to help prevent these illnesses in people. Household T ransmission Study P rotocol Protocol: Information sheet and consent forms for household Version enrol2018 v2Investigator: Cheryl Cohen Approval by WITS HREC, approved Date of approval 16 Janua ry 2018 - 2 - We are conducting a study to try and understand how infectious diseases are passed on in h ouseholds. We are interested in viruses and bacteria that cause respiratory illness (for example influenza and tuberculosis (TB) ). We are also interested in the bacteria that causes meningitis called meningococcus. The names of all these germs are confusin g so it is easier to group them into the germs that cause respiratory illness (colds , flu and pneumonia (chest infections)) and the germs that cause meningitis (infection in the brain). We know that some people are at risk of getting very severe forms of t hese illness es, these groups include very young children, the elderly, people with other illness es (like heart disease, diabetes and other lung conditions), and people who have weak immune systems (like people with HIV). We would like to know how these in fections enter the household and then how they are passed on in the house . This is why we are doing this study in the household. There are important factors in household s, including the compositions of the household (how many young children, children who go to school, people who work and people who stay in the household). There are also important factors like smoking and making of fires inside the house which also play a role in the transmission of infections. In order to help us explain all these thi ngs we are planning a study that will enroll 100 household in the Bushbuckridge district and in Klerksdorp each year . Each household will be asked to be part of the study for one year. During this year we will do a number of things after the household memb ers have signed consent to participate, details of each of these procedure are outlined later in this form. All the following procedure apply to you as an adult and/or your child 1. Complete a detailed questionnaire for each person in the home including questions about your age, the kind of work you do, what illness you may have and some questions about your home (number of rooms, cooking etc). 2. We will a sk about your HIV status and if necessary do testing for HIV (as explained in detail below) . 3. We will take blood samples 10mls (two teaspoon) from adults and 5ml s (one teaspoon) from children aged <15 years , at the beginning of the study and the n three times during the year. These blood samples will be tested for bacteria and viruses and for your bodies' reaction to these viruses. 4. If you test positive for HIV or are already HIV positive we will take additional blood samples for CD4 and viral load testing, this is an additional two 10ml (two teaspoon) samples 5. In September we will take one additiona l blood sample which will be 1ml (less than one teaspoon) from children aged <15 years and 5ml s (one teaspoon) from adults . These blood samples will be tested for a particular bacterium, streptococcus, which causes pneumonia and meningitis. 6. Take a sputum sample at the beginning of the study , this sample will be tested for TB (if you test positive for TB we will refer you for treatment ). 7. Once a month we will ask you if you have a cough and we will take a sputum specimen for TB and pertussis testing. If you test positive for TB /pertussis we will refer you for treatment. Household T ransmission Study P rotocol Protocol: Information sheet and consent forms for household Version enrol2018 v2Investigator: Cheryl Cohen Approval by WITS HREC, approved Date of approval 16 Janua ry 2018 - 3 - 8. At the beginning of the year and again at the end of the year we will to a skin test to check for TB infection . This test involves inserting a small needle under the skin and then looking at your bodies reaction to the test after 3 days 9. Take a urine sample at the beginning of the study. This urin e sample will be tested for a chemical that tells us how much you smoke and how much smoke the rest of your household is exposed to. 10. At the enrolment visit and following that at the twice week ly household visit we will take a swab (from the nose) from each member of the household . At the follow up visits we will ask a few simple questions about any respiratory symptoms you may have exper ienced. These swabs will be tested for the germs that cause respiratory illness. If you have experienced/are experiencing any respiratory symptoms we can refer you for treatment. 11. Towards the middle of the year in July or August , we will take a throat swab ; this swab will be tested for the bacteria that cause meningitis. 12. We will also ask if anyone has been in hospital or died. We will ask question s about why they went to hospital and what they died from. 13. We will put a small machine in the house that will m easure the temperature and humidity in your house. These machines are similar to a thermometer and will not interfere with your day to day activities. 14. At two points in the study (once in the summer months and once in the winter months) we will also put a m achine in your house that measures the amount of carbon monoxide (smoke) and carbon dioxide in your home. These machine s will not interfere with your day to day activities. 15. At two points in the study (once in the summer months and once in the winter months ) we will ask one person in your household to wear a device that will measure the amount of air pollution (particulate matter and carbon monoxide) they are exposed to. This device has a GPS logger attached to it for us to understand where the air was sampled. The person who will wear the device will also be asked individually to consent to wear the device. 16. We will place a small thermometer in your house to measure temperatures in the house. 17. For two weeks every month we will ask you to wear a small dev ice on your clothing, this device is called a proximity sensor and is designed to measure how close you come to other members of you r household. We would like you to wear this device all day. This device is not a camera. As HIV infection weakens the immu ne system. HIV infected people react differently to infection, knowing the HIV status of people in this study is very important. There are a number of ways for us to do this. We can offer you a rapid test and you will get the result after about 15 minutes. We can take a blood sample and test it in the laboratory (you will get the result in about a month ), or if you do not wish to know your results we can test the blood sample but not give you the results. Because HIV is a treatable infection it is important to know your status so that you can access treatment for the infection and live a healthy life. It is also important that you know the status of your children so that they can access treatment early. In this study we will offer you an HIV test, we will a lso offer this test to your children. It may be difficult for you to receive your test results at home and so we can facilitate giving you the result at a nearby clinic or in a private location. The study team can also assist you with giving Household T ransmission Study P rotocol Protocol: Information sheet and consent forms for household Version enrol2018 v2Investigator: Cheryl Cohen Approval by WITS HREC, approved Date of approval 16 Janua ry 2018 - 4 - an HIV result to your child/ren. Also we able to refer you for further counselling to deal with your HIV status should you need this assistance. Our teams are trained in HIV pre and posttest counselling and will provide this before and after testing. Some people may fi nd it hard to disclose their HIV status to family members. It may also it be difficult to disclose the status of your child to your family. Our trained counselors will help you through the process of disclosure should you need this assistance. You may chan ge your mind at any stage of the study and we can arrange for you to receive the latest HIV test results. We will also be doing HIV testing later in the year and we will discuss the test with you prior to the time. If you would like to test for HIV at any time during the study we will be happy to assist you with testing and receiving your results. Length of study and number of participants The study will be performed in South Africa only . Approximately 1500 participants will participate in this study , 100 households each year with an average of 5 people in each household . Every household member, regardless of their age will be asked to participate . We will visit the household twice a week for the period of one year. After that we will visit the househ old three times a year for a maximum of two years. During these visit will be take a blood sample to test for influenza and RSV infection (5mls from children and 10ml from adults . Additional blood samples will be taken if you test positive for HIV ( additional 20 ml) At one of these follow up visits we will also redo the TST and HIV tests on those people who tested negative previously. Study procedures 1. Blood samples : Blood will be taken from your arm in a standard medical procedure ; this will be do ne by a trained nurse. 2. HIV testing a. If you are HIV -positive and have some way of showing us this, either by a clinic record or your ARV treatment we will not need to test you for HIV. b. We can do a rapid HIV test at your house by doing a small prick on your finger and you will be able to receive the result immediately c. We can also test the blood sample that we have taken at the beginning of the study or at one of the follow up visit for HIV in the laboratory in Johannesburg. If you choose for us to do this we can still give you your results if you would like to know them , as per the details on HIV testing above. 3. Naso -pharyngeal s wab (swabs are like a long cotton bud) , the nurse will put a swab into your nose until it touches the back of your throat. 4. Throat swabs. After asking you to open your mouth wide, the nurse will put the swab into the back of your mouth and touch the back of your throat with the swab. 5. Sputum samples , we will ask you to cough into a small bottle. 6. Urine will be collected in a small bottle, the nurse will explain how to do this and you will collect the sample yourself in the bathroom. Skin test for TB, the nurse will give you a very small injection into the skin with a very small needle, this may cause a sligh t swelling on your arm. After 2 to 3 days the nurse will come back to measure how big the swelling is.

At the second visit we will take all the samples this visit will take about an hour per person including taking the blood sample s, sputum, skin test, urine sample and HIV test . The follow -up visits will be about 15 minutes per person. We will try to arrange these visits when most people in the household are present and this may involve us visiting your household in the evening or over weekends. At the end of each visit the study team will tell you what will be happening at the next visit and how long they will need with each person. This will include the once of visits for the additional blood samples and the throat swabs. Risks of this study There is minimal risk to you in this study as we are only asking questions about your normal behaviour at home. You may find some of the questions uncomfortable. There may be minimal discomfort when we take the nasopharyngeal or throat sample. Some people may gag when we take the sample, but the procedure only takes a few seconds. Some people may experience a short nose bleed. The TB skin test has a slight risk of discomfort and may result in slight swelling of the arm. Venipunctures (i.e. drawing blood) ar e normally done as part of routine medical care and present a slight risk of discomfort. Drawing blood may result in faintness, inflammation of the vein, pain, bruising or bleeding at the puncture site. There is also a slight possibility of infection. You r protection is that experienced personnel perform the procedures under sterile conditions. Testing for HIV may be stressful, we will have a trained counsellor to explain all about the test and what the results will mean to you or your child. We will also refer you directly into the treatment programme if you do test positive for HIV. Benefits of this study By taking part in this study , you will help us learn more about how certain infectious disease s affect different people and who may benefit from v accines. You will have a chance to get the results of you r HIV and TB tests and if you test positive for these infectious you will get the benefit of early treatment. Confidentiality Every effort will be made to protect your confidentiality : study forms and blood samples will be marked with a number and not a name. Study staff will keep a log of household members and identifying details of household members, these will be kept in secure locked offices. No reference to personal detail will be made in any s tudy report or in the final results of the study. Withdrawal from the study Household T ransmission Study P rotocol Protocol: Information sheet and consent forms for household Version enrol2018 v2Investigator: Cheryl Cohen Approval by WITS HREC, approved Date of approval 16 Janua ry 2018 - 6 - Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you can decline to participate, or stop at any time, without stating any reason. Your withdrawal will not affect your a ccess to other medical care. The investigators retain the right to withdraw you from the study if it is considered to be in your best interest. If you did not give an accurate history or did not follow the guidelines of the study and the regulations of t he study facility, you may be withdrawn from the study at any time. Reimbursement for Participation You will not be paid to participate in this study. However we will offer you some reimbursement for the time and inconvenience of participating in this study . We will offer you a voucher to be redeemed at a supermarket for items sold at that supermarket. Each member of the household will receive a voucher to the val ue of R25 for each of the visits. If you miss a visit you will not be reimbursed for the visit. For a household of 5 people counting the twice weekly visits this would be in the region of R1000 worth of vouchers for an average month. In addition, each mem ber will receive an additional R25 voucher to the value of R25 each time they return a proximity sensor without any visible damage. We will also provide you with a once -off R50 electricity voucher while the air monitoring equipment is in your home to reimb urse you for the electivity the device uses. The study will not pay for any care that you need for the any illness diagnosed during this study. We will share the results of the HIV and TB tests with you so that you will know if you have been infected with these illnesses. In addition , we are able to refer you for medical help to your nearest clinic if this is necessary.

Investigator: Prof Cheryl Cohen 011 3866593, day time and 082 803 8093 , afterhours Hello. My name is __________________________ and I would like to explain the surveillance/study that we are doing here that we'd like you to be part of. You can help by listening and then tell me whether you would like to be part of the study or not. Why are we doing this study? Infectious diseases are cause d by different germs ( virus , bacteria or parasites). By infectious we mean that the illness can be passed from one person to the next. It is important to understand the way these infections are passed on to other people. The home is an important place for passing on these infection s because people spend time together in close contact. The information from the study will help to make guidelines for the use of vaccines (injections that prevent infections) and other ways that we can prevent these illnesses in people. We are interested in viruses and bacteria that cause respiratory illness (for example influenza and tuberculosis (TB) ). We are also interested in the bacteria that cause infection s of the brain (meningitis ). The names of all these germs are confusing so it is easier to group them into the germs that cause respiratory illness (colds , flu and pneumonia (chest infections)) and the germs that cause meningitis (infection in the brain). We will also be testing peop le for HIV in this study. This is because people with HIV react differently to infections. If you are older than 12 and would like to know you r HIV status please talk to your parents and the counsellor. We can give you the result at your home with your par ents support or if you are older than 1 2 we can refer you to a clinic to receive your results. We would like to know how these infections come into the home, meaning who brings the infection into the house and then how the infections are passed to other people in the home. Household T ransmission Study P rotocol Protocol: Assent form Version enrol2018 Investigator: Cheryl Cohen Approval by WITS HREC, approved Date of approval 10 November 2017 - 2 - There are important things about homes , including the how many young children, how children who go to school, how many people go to work and how many people stay at home that can help us understand how infections are passed from one per son to the next . In home there are also factors like people who smoke, the amount of fresh air that flows through the house and the making of fires inside the house which also play a part in passing infections from one person to the next. We will also ask you to wear a small button on your clothes; this device is able to measure how close you come to other household members. This device is not a camera. In order to help us understand all these things we are planning a study that will ask people in 100 homes in the Bushbuckridge district and in Klerksdorp to agree to be part of the study . Each person in the home will be asked to be part of the study for one year. During this year we will do a number of things after the people in the home members have s igned consent to participate . Here is a list of the things that we would like you to take part in. What will happening to you during the study? 1. We will ask you a number of questions about your age, where you go to school, what illness you may have and s ome questions about your home (number of rooms, way of cooking etc). 2. We would like to take a photograph of you, this photo will only be used as a confirmation when we put the study number on your samples. This will help the study team to make 100% sure tha t your samples is labelled with your study number. This photo graph will not be visible to any person on the data team. 3. Blood samples : Blood will be taken from your arm; this will be done by a trained nurse. 4. Throat swabs (swabs are like a long cotton bud). After asking you to open your mouth wide , the nurse will put the swab into the back of your mouth and touch the back of your throat with the swab. 5. Nose swab, we will put a swab into your nose until it touches the back of your throat. 6. Sputum (spit co ughed up) samples , we will ask you to cough into a small bottle. 7. A skin test for TB 8. If you are older than 15, a u rine will be collected in a small bottle, the nurse will explain how to do this and you will collect the sample yourself in the bathroom. 9. After your family has completed one year of follow up we would like to see you and take blood three times a year until the end of 2018 Your rights as a participant You do not have to be in this study if you do not want to . You won' t get into any trouble with me, or your parent/guardian if you say no. You may stop being in the study at any time. If you want to be in the study now but change your mind later, that's okay. You can stop at any time. Your parent/s/guardian/s will be asked if it is okay for you to be in this study. Even if they say it's okay, it is still your choice whether or not to take part. Household T ransmission Study P rotocol Protocol: Assent form Version enrol2018 Investigator: Cheryl Cohen Approval by WITS HREC, approved Date of approval 10 November 2017 - 3 - You can ask any qu estions you have, now or later. If you think of a question later, you or your parent /guardian can contact us. Expected duration of participation The first visit will be quite short, we will ask you to sign on a piece of paper if you want to take part, and then we will ask you/your parent some questions about your health and will ask questions about the house. The second visit will take about an hour for each person including taking the blood sample s; the follow -up visits will be about 15 minutes per person. We will try to arrange these visits when most people in the household are present and this may involve us visiting your household in the evening or over weekends. Risks of this study We don't think that any big problems will happen to you as part of this study, but you may feel some pain when we prick you to collect blood and it may be uncomfortable when we c ollect samples from your nose and throat but this will be quick and the discomfort will not last for long. The nurse/s that will be collecting the samples are all trained and they have been collecting similar type of samples from other children without any problems. Benefits of this study By taking part in this study , you will help us learn more about how certain infectious disease s affect different people and who may benefit from vaccines. You will also get the results of the tests if you have any infecti on that can be treated, like TB. Confidentiality Every effort will be made to keep all your information a secret : study information and blood samples will be marked with a number and not a name. Your name will not be used when we report on the results to other people . Withdrawal from the study Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you can stop participating , stop at any time, without giving a reason. If you leave the study it will not affect your access to other medical care. Ethical approval All researchers have to explain the work they plan to do to a committee.
