Strategy : > Improve medical care delivery > Remove Waste and Friction > Use the savings to increase benefits for employees and reduce workers' comp rates for employers. > Win - Win 010How Was This Done? Improve healthcare quality and delivery. Use evidence- based guidelines for presumptive first-level treatment decisions. Establish protocol (hierarchy of decision making) for escalating to other treatment regimens based on individual circumstances. Reduce over- care, i.e., provide evidenced based care first before surgery is considered. Eliminate litigation over issues that belong to the healthcare experts, not lawyers and judges. 011The Foundation of Effective Reform > Improving healthcare quality and delivery. > Access to quality medical care through medical provider networks and ombudsman. > Standardized reference material for first level, evidence-based treatment. 012History: DIR contracted Rand Corp to conduct a comprehensive study of existing medical treatment guidelines, applying the following criteria to rate their acceptability\u2014Are they/Do they:(1) Evidence-based, (2) Peer reviewed and nationally recognized, (3) Address the full range of tests and therapies commonly utilized particularly for injuries of spine, arm , and leg, (4) Reviewed or updated at least every three years, (5) Developed by a multidisciplinary clinical team, (6) Cost less than $500 per individual user to subscribe 013Rand Study Evaluation:ACOEM stands out overwhelmingly as the best choice, particularly with its adherence to the principle of evidence- based validation. ACOEM subsequently addresses recommendations of Rand Study for continuous improvement. ACOEM Guidelines become the legal standard in California. 014What are guidelines and why use them? It is a set of regulations that provide the clinician with an analytical framework for the evaluation and treatment of injured workers in the workers' compensation system . It is the primary source of guidance for treating physicians and physician reviewers in workers 'compensation. It provides the pathway to providing appropriate patient care and getting treatment requests approved. Good for workers: guidelines are presumed correct. Formulary is a component of the medical treatment guideline. The drug list is not stand alone it needs to be in conjunction with treatment guideline. 015Remaining Challenges Resistance to change.

All Rights Reserved. NCCI estimates that the changes to the fee schedule in Alaska , effective January 1, 2019 , will result in a negligible1 impact on overall workers compensation system costs. SUMMARY OF CHANGES The major changes to the Alaska medical fee schedule (MFS) effective 1/1/2019 include: Update to the Physician Fee Schedule to incorporate 2019 Medicare Resource -Based Relative Value Units (RBRVUs) established for each CPT2 code and published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The prior Physician Fee Schedule was based on 2018 Medicare RBRVUs. The conversion factors established by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development (DLWD) for surgery, radiology, and pathology & lab services have been updated from $ 174 to $165, $206 to $196, and $ 142 to $135, respectively. All other conversion factors remain unchanged. Update to the Hospital Inpatient Fee Schedule to incorporate 2019 Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (M S-DRG) weights. The prior Hospital Inpatient Fee Schedule was based on 2018 MS-DRG weights and hospital specific base rates. The DLWD established multipliers for each hospital to be applied to the Medicare Maximum Allowable Reimbursement (MAR) amount. All multipliers remain unchanged , with the exception of Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital which is now a critical access hospital . Update to the Hospital Outpatient Fee Schedule and Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) Fee Schedule to incorporate 2019 Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) relative weights established for each CPT code and published by the CMS. The prior Hospital Outpatient Fee Schedule was based on 2018 OPPS relative weights. The conversion factor es tablished by the DLWD remains at $221.79. Update to the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) Fee Schedule to incorporate 2019 DMEPOS MARs established for each HCPCS3 code published by the CMS. The prior DMEPOS fee sched ule was based on 2018 MARs. As established by the DLWD, DMEPOS services will continue to be reimbursed at 184% of Medicare's DMEPOS fee schedule. Update to the intrastate air ambulance fees associated with wing air mile rates to incorporate the 2019 Ambulance Fee Schedule MARs established for each HCPCS code and published by the CMS. The prior intrastate air ambulance fee schedule was based on 2018 MARs. As established by the DLWD, intrastate air ambulance HCPCS codes associated with wing air mile rates will not 1 Negligible is defined in this document to be an impact of less than 0.1%. 2 Current Procedural Terminology maintained by the American Medical Association 3 Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System maintained by the CMS 089 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE CHANGES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019 Page 2 of 5 CONTACT: 9 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. exceed 400% of the Medicare fee schedule rate. The fixed wing lif t-off fee will not exceed $11,500 and the rotary wing lift -off fee will not exceed $13,500. ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS NCCI's methodology to evaluate the impact of medical fee schedule changes includes three major steps: 1. Calculate the percentage change in maximum reimbursements Compare the prior and revised maximum reimbursements by procedure code and determine the percentage change by procedure code. Calculate the weighted -average percentage change in maximum reimbursements for the fee schedule using observed payments by procedure code as weights. 2. Estimate the pri ce level change as a result of the revised fee schedule NCCI research by David Col\u00f3n and Paul Hendrick, \"The Impact of Fee Schedule Updates on Physician Payments\" (2018), suggests that approximately 80% of the change in maximum reimbursements for physician fee schedules is realized on payments impacted by the change. For non -physician fee schedule changes, a price realization factor of 80% is assumed. 3. Determine the share of costs that are subject to the fee schedule The share is based on a combination of f ields, such as procedure code, provider type, and place of service, as reported on the NCCI Medical Data Call, to categorize payments that are subject to the fee schedule. The share is calculated as the greater of the percent of observed payments with a maximum allowable reimbursement (MAR) or 75%. NCCI assumes no change for the share of costs not subject to the fee schedule. In this analysis, NCCI relies primarily on two data sources: Detailed medical data underlying the calculations in this analysis are based on NCCI's Medical Data Call for Alaska for Service Year 2017 . The share of benefit costs attributed to medical benefits is based on NCCI's Financial Call data for Alaska from Policy Years 2014, 2015, and 20 16 projected to the effective date of the benefit changes. Physician Fee Schedule In Alaska , payments for physician services represent 46.8 % of total medical costs. The overall change in maximums for physician services is a weighted average of the percentage change in MAR by procedure code ( Revised MAR/ Prior MAR). The weights are based on Service Year 20 17 observed payments by procedure code for Alaska , as reported on NCCI's Medical Data Call. The overall weighted -average 090 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE CHANGES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019 Page 3 of 5 CONTACT: 9 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. percentage change in maximums for physician services is -2.3%. The impact by category is shown in the following table. Physician Practice Category Share of Physician Costs Percentage Change in MAR Anesthesia 4.0% 0.0% 0.2% 0.0% Physician Payments with no specific MAR 3.4% - Total Physician Costs 100.0% -2.3% A price realization factor of 80% was applied. The impact on physician payments after applying the price realization factor is -1.8% (= -2.3% x 0.80). The above impact of -1.8% is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to physician payments in Alaska (46.8 %) to arrive at an impact of -0.8% on medical costs. This is then multiplied by the percentage of benefit costs attributed to medical benefits in Alaska (70% ) to arrive at an impact on overall workers compensation costs of -0.6%. Hospital Inpatient Fee Schedule In Alaska , payments for hospital inpatient services represent 12.1 % of total medical costs. Of these payments, 83.5 % have a MAR. The overall change in maximums for hospital inpatient services is a weighted average of the percentage change in MAR by episode (Revised MAR/Prior MAR). The weights are based on Service Year 20 17 observed payments by episode for Alaska , as reported on NCCI's Medical Data Call. The overall weighted -average percentage change in maximums for hospital inpatient services is +3.1%4. A price realization factor of 80% was applied. The impact on hospital inpatient payments after applying the price realization factor is +2.5% (= +3.1% x 0.80). The above impact of + 2.5% is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to hospital inpatient payments in Alaska (12.1 %) to arrive at an impact of + 0.3% on medical costs. This is then multiplied by the percentage of bene fit costs attributed to medical benefits in Alaska (70%) to arrive at an impact of + 0.2% on overall workers compensation costs. 4 This does not include the impact of any change in reimbursement levels due Mt. Edgecumbe 's transition to a critical access hospital. This impact is expected to be minimal . 091 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE CHANGES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019 Page 4 of 5 CONTACT: 9 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Hospital Outpatient Fee Schedule In Alaska , payments for hospital outpatient services represent 14.4 % of total medical costs. Of these payments, 90.6 % have a MAR. The impact on hospital outpatient services , which is calculated in an analogous manner to the physician fee schedule change , is +1.0 %. A price realization factor of 80% was applied. The impact on hospital outpatient payments after applying the price realization factor is +0.8% (= +1.0% x 0.80). The above impact of +0.8 % is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to hospital outpatient payments in Alaska (14.4 %) to arrive at an impact of +0.1 % on medical costs. This is then multiplied by the percentage of benefit costs attributed to medical benefits in Alaska (70%) to arrive at an impact of +0.1 % on overall workers compensation costs. Note that Medicare rules for outpatient services contain a comprehensive payment policy that packages payment for adjunctive and secondary items, services, and procedures into the primary procedure under certain circumstances. For this analysis, the experience is aggregated accord ing to the packaging rules reflected under Medicare, if applicable. Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASC) Fee Schedule In Alaska , payments for ASC services represent 11.4 % of total medical costs. Of these payments, 90.5 % have a MAR. The impact on ASC services , which is calculated in an analogous manner to the physician fee schedule change , is +3.1 %. A price realization factor of 80% was applied. The impact on ASC payments after applying the price realization factor is +2.5% (= +3.1% x 0.80). The above impact of +2.5 % is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to ASC payments in Alaska (11.4 %) to arrive at an impact of +0.3 % on medical costs. This is then multiplied by the percentage of benefit costs attributed to medical benefits in Alaska (70%) to arrive at an impact of +0.2 % on overall workers compensation costs. Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Sup plies (DMEPOS) Fee Schedule In Alaska , payments for DMEPOS services represent 3.9% of total medical costs. The impact on DMEPOS services , which is calculated in an analogous manner to the physician fee schedule change , is +1.8%. A price realization factor of 80% was applied. The impact on DMEPOS service payments after applying the price realization factor is +1.4% (= +1.8% x 0.80) . The above impact of +1.4 % is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to DME POS payments in Alaska (3.9%) to arrive at an impact of +0.1 % on medical costs. This is then multiplied by the percentage of benefit costs attributed to medical benefits in Alaska (70%) to arrive at an impact of +0.1 % on overall workers compensation costs. 092 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE CHANGES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019 Page 5 of 5 CONTACT: 9 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Intrastate Air Ambulance Fee Schedule In Alaska , payments for air ambulance services represent 2.4% of total medical payments , and 37.4% of air ambulance payments are for intrastate flights. Therefore, the payments for intrastate air ambulance service s represent 0.9% (= 2.4% x 37.4%) of total medical payments. The impact on intrastate air ambulance services , which is calculated in an analogous manner to the physician fee schedule change, is +1.4% . The impact on intrastate air ambulance payments after applying the price realization factor is +1.1% (= +1.4% x 0.80) . The above impact of +1.1% is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to intrastate air ambulance payments in Alaska ( 0.9%) to arriv e at a negligible increase o n medical costs and on overall workers compensation costs.

Update to the Durable Medical E quipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics , and Supplies (DMEPOS) Fee Schedule to incorporate 2018 DMEP OS MARs established for each H CPCS2 code published by the CMS. The prior DMEPOS fee schedule was based on 2017 MARs. As established by the DLWD, DMEPOS services will continue to be reimbursed at 184% of Medic are's DMEPOS fee schedule. Update to the intrastate air ambulance fees associated with win g air mile rates to incorporate the 2018 Ambulance Fee Schedule MARs established for each HCPCS code and published by the CMS. The prior intrastate air ambulance fee schedule was ba sed on 2017 MARs. As established by the DLWD, intrastate air ambulance HCPCS codes a ssociated with wing air mile rates will not exceed 400% of the Medicare fee schedule rate. T he fixed wing liftoff fee will not exceed $11,500 and the rotary win g lift off fee will not exceed $13,500. Actuarial Analysis NCCI's methodology to evaluate the impact of medical fee schedu le changes includes three major steps: 1. Calculate the percentage change in maximum reimbursements Compare the prior and revised maximum reimbursements by procedure code and determine the percentage change by procedure code. Calculate the weightedaverage percentage change in maximum rei mbursements for the fee schedule using observed payments by procedure code as w eights. 2. Estimate the price level change as a result of the revised fee schedule NCCI research by Frank Schmid a nd Nathan Lord (2013), \"The Impa ct of Physician Fee Schedule Changes in Workers Compensation: Evidence from 31 Sta tes\", suggests that a portion of a change in maximum re imbursements is realized on pa yments impacted by the change. o In response to a fee schedule dec rease, NCCI research indicates that physician payments decline by approximately 50% of the fee schedule chang e. 2 Healthcare Common Procedure Codi ng System maintained by the CM S 095 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDIC AL FEE SCHEDULE CHANGES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 National Council on Compensation Insurance, In c. All Rights Reserved. o In response to a fee schedule inc rease, NCCI research indicates that physician payments increase by approximately 80% of the fee schedule change. The magnitude of the response for physician fee schedules depends o n the relative difference between actual payments and fee schedule maximums (i .e. the price departure). Consequently, the fo rmula used to determine the per cent realized for physician fee schedule changes is 80% x (1.10 + 1.20 x (pri ce departure)). For nonphysician fee schedule changes, a price realization factor of 80% is assumed. 3. Determine the share of costs tha t are subject to the fee schedu le The share is based on a combination of fields, such as procedure code, provider type, and place of service, as reporte d on the NCCI Medical Data Call , to categorize payments that are subject to the fee schedule. The share is calculated as the greater of the percent of observ ed payments with a MAR or 75%. NCCI assumes no change for the share of costs not subje ct to the fee schedule. In this analysis, NCCI relies primarily on two data sources: Detailed medical data underlying the calculations in this analy sis are based on NCCI's Medical Data Call for Alas ka for Service Year 2016. The share of benefit costs attributed to medical benefits is ba sed on NCCI's Financial Call data for Alaska from the latest three policy years projected to the effective date of the benefit changes. Physician Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for physician services represent 47.1% of t otal medical costs. Of these payments, 91.1% have a MAR. The overall change in maximums for physician services is a weighted average of the percentage change in MAR by proced ure code (Revised MAR/Prior M AR). The weights are based on Service Year 2016 observed payme nts by procedure code for Alaska, as reported on N CCI's Medical Data Call. The overall weightedaverage percentage change in maximums for physician services is 7.1%. The impact by category is shown in the following table. 096 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDIC AL FEE SCHEDULE CHANGES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 National Council on Compensation Insurance, In c.

Note that Medicare rules for out patient services contain a comprehensive payment policy that packages payment for adjunctive and secon dary items, services, and proce dures into the primary procedure under certain circumstances. For this analysis, the experience is aggregated according to the packaging rules reflected under Medicare, if applicable. Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASC) Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for ASC services represent 11.6% of total medical costs. Of these payments, 90.2% have a MAR. The impact on ASC services, which is calculated in an analogous manner to the physician fee schedule change, is +2.8%. A price realization factor of 80 % was applied.

All Rights Reserved. NCCI estimates that changes to the Alaska Medical Fee Schedule (MFS) due to the update of Medicare fee schedules by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) effective January 1, 20171 will result in an overall impact on Alaska's workers compensation system costs of +0.2%. Summary of Changes Alaska's MFS was adopted by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development (DLWD) effective 1/1/2016. The major changes to the Alaska MFS effective 1/1/2017 include: 1. Update to the Physician Fee Schedule to incorporate 2017 Medicare Resource Based Relative Value Units (RBRVUs) established for each CPT2 code and published by the CMS.

Update to the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) Fee Schedule to incorporate 2017 DMEPOS maximum allowable reimbursements (MARs) established for each HCPCS3 code and published by the CMS. The prior DMEPOS fee schedule was based on 2016 MARs. As established by the DLWD , DMEPOS services will continue to be reimbursed at 184% of Medicare's DMEPOS fee schedule. 6. Update to the intrastate air ambulance fees associated with wing air mile rates to incorporate the 2017 Ambulance Fee Schedule MARs established for each HCPCS code and published by the CMS. The prior intrastate air ambulance fee schedule was based on 2016 MARs. As established by the DLWD, intrastate air ambulance HCPCS codes associated with wing air mile rates will not exceed 400% of the Medicare fee schedule rate. The fixed wi ng lift off fee will not exceed $11,500 and the rotary wing lift off fee will not exceed $13,500.

All Rights Reserved. In this analysis, NCCI relies primarily on two data sources: Detailed medical data underlying the calculations in this analysis are based on NCCI's Medical Data Call for Alaska for Service Year (SY) 2015. For the hospital inpatient fee schedule analysis, Medical Data Call for Alaska for SY 2014 was used as well. The share of benefit costs attribu ted to medical benefits is based on NCCI's Financial Call data for Alaska from the latest three policy years projected to the effective date of the benefit changes. Physician Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for physician services represent 48.0% of total medical payments. To calculate the percentage change in MARs for physician services, NCCI calculates the percentage change in MAR for each procedure code. The overall change in MARs for physician services is a weighted average of the percentage change in MARs (revise d MAR / prior MAR) by procedure code weighted by the observed payments by procedure code as reported on NCCI's Medical Data Call, for Alaska for SY 2015. The overall, weighted average percentage change in MARs is +0.4%. The impact by service category is shown in the table below: Physician Pra ctice Category Share of Physician Costs Percentage Change in 4.0% 0.0% Physical) 29.7% +0.8% Evaluation and Management 14.0% +0.5% Physician Payments with no specific MAR 8.1% Total Physician Costs 100.0% +0.4% Since the overall average MAR for physician services increased, the percent expected to be realized from the fee schedule increase is estimated according to the formula 80% x (1.10 + 1.20 x (price departure)). The observed price departure for physician payments in Alaska is 13%, which implies the ratio of actual payments to the prior fee schedul e maximum is 0.87. The price realization factor is estimated to be 76% (= 80% x (1.10 + 1.20 x (0.13))). The impact on physician payments after applying the price realization factor is +0.3% (= +0.4% x 0.76). The above impact of +0.3% is th en multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to physician payments (48.0%) to arrive at the impact on medical costs of +0.1%. This is then multiplied by the percentage of Alaska benefit costs attributed to medical benefits (72.9%) to arrive at an impact of +0.1% on overall workers compensation costs in Alaska. 102 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE UPDATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Hospital Outpatient Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for hospital outpatient services represent 12.7% of total medical payments. To calculate the percentage change in MARs for hospital outpatient services, NCCI calculates the percentage change in MAR for each procedure. The overall change in MARs for hospital outpatient services is a weighted average of the percentage change in MARs (revised MAR / prior MA R) by procedure weighted by the observed payments by procedure as reported on NCCI's Medical Data Call, for Alaska for SY 2015. The prior and revised MARs are based on the Calendar Year (CY) 2016 and CY 2017 version of Medicare's OPPS relative weights, res pectively, and a conversion factor of $221.79. Note that Medicare rules for outpatient services contain a comprehensive payment policy that packages payment for adjunctive and secondary items, services, and procedures into the primary procedure under certain circumstances. For this analysis, the experience is aggregated according to the packaging rules reflected under Medicare, if applicabl e. The overall, weighted average percentage change in MAR for hospital outpatient services is 0.4%. Since the overall average MAR for outpatient services decreased, NCCI expects that 50% of the decrease will be realized on hospital outpatient price levels. The impact on hospital outpatient services payments after applying th e price realization factor is 0.2% (= 0.4% x 0.50). The above impact of 0.2% is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to hospital outpatient payments in Alaska (12.7%) to arrive at a negligible 4 decrease on both medical and overall workers compensation costs in Alaska. Hospital Inpatient Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for hospital inpatient services represent 10.6% of total medical payments for SY 2015. To calculate the percentage change in MARs for hospital inpatient services, NCCI calculates the percentage change in MAR for each inpatient hospital episode that is reported with a Medicare severity diagnosis related group (MSDRG) code. The overall change in MA Rs for hospital inpatient services is a weighted average of the percentage change in MARs (revised MAR / prior MAR) for each episode weighted by the observed payments by episode as reported on NCCI's Medical Data Call, for Alaska for SYs 2014 and 2015. Two SYs are used to enhan ce the reliability of hospital inpatient experience. The prior and revised MARs are based on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 and FY 2017 version of Medicare's MSDRG relative weights, respectively, and a hospital specific base rate. This analysis uses a weighted average of the hospitalspecific convers ion factors weighted by the number of admissions by hospital as reported to the CMS. The overall, weighted average percentage change in MAR for hospital inpatient services is 0.2%. Since the overall average MAR for hospital inpatient services decreased, NCCI expects that 50% of the decrease will be realized on hospital inpatient pri ce levels. The impact on hospital inpatient payments after applying the price realization factor is 0.1% (= 0.2% x 0.5). 4 Negligible is defined in this document to be an impact on overall system costs of less than 0.1%. 103 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE UPDATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. The above impact of 0.1% is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to hospital inpatient payments (10.6%) for Service Year 2015 to arrive at a negligible decrease on both medical and overall workers compensation costs in Alaska. ASC Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for ASC services represent 14.4% of total medical payments. The impact on ASC services due to the adoption of the 2017 Medicare OPPS relative weights is calculated in an analogous manner to the hospital outpatient fee schedule change. The overall, weighted average percentage change in MAR for ASC services is +2.0% . Since the overall average MAR for ASC services increased, the percentage expected to be realized from the fee schedule increase is estimated according to the formula 80% x (1.1 + 1.2 x (price departure)). Since a reliable price departure could not be determined, NCCI assumed a price r ealization factor of 80%. The impact on ASC payments after applying the price realization factor is +1.6% (= +2.0% x 0.80). The above impact of +1.6% is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to ASC payments in Alaska (14.4%) to arrive at the impact on medical costs of +0.2%. This is then multi plied by the percentage of Alaska benefit costs attributed to medical benefits (72.9%) to arrive at an impact of +0.1% on overall workers compensation system costs in Alaska. DMEPOS Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) services represent 4.4% of total medical payments. To calculate the percentage change in MARs for DMEPOS services, NCCI calculates the percentage change in MAR for each code. The overall change in MARs for DMEPOS services is a weighted average of the perc entage change in MARs (revised MAR / prior MAR) by code weighted by the observed payments by code as reported on NCCI's Medical Data Call for Alaska for Service Year 2015. The overall, weightedaverage percentage change in MAR for DMEPOS services is 1.1%. Since the overall average MAR for DMEPOS services decreased, NCCI expe cts that 50% of the decrease will be realized on DMEPOS price levels. The impact on payments for DMEPOS services after applying the price realization factor is 0.6% (= 1.1% x 0.50). The above impact of 0.6% is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attrib uted to DMEPOS payments in Alaska (4.4%) to arrive at a negligible decrease on both medical and on overall workers compensation costs in Alaska. Intrastate Air Ambulance Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for air ambulance services represent 1.5% of total medical payments and 54.1% of air ambulance payments are for intrastate flights. Therefore, the payments for intrastate air ambulance 104 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE UPDATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017 \u00a9 Copyright 2017 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. services represent 0.8% (= 1.5% x 54.1%) of total medical payments. To calculate the percentage change in MARs for intrastate air ambulance services, NCCI calculates the percentage change in MAR for each service. The overall change in MARs for air ambulance services is a weighted average of the percentage change in MARs (revise d MAR / prior MAR) by procedure code weighted by the observed payments by procedure code as reported on NCCI's Medical Data Call, for Alaska for Service Year 2015. The overall, weighted average percentage change in MAR for intrastate air ambulance services is +0.4%. Since the overall average MAR for in trastate air ambulance services increased, the percentage expected to be realized from the fee schedule increase is estimated according to the formula 80% x (1.10 + 1.20 x (price departure)). Since a reliable price departure could not be determined, NCCI assumed a price realization factor of 80%. The impact on in trastate air ambulance payments after applying the price realization factor is +0.3% (=+0.4% x 0.80). The above impact of +0.3% is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs subject to the intrastate air ambulance fee schedule in Alaska (0.8%) to arrive at a negligible increase on both medical and overall wor kers compensation system costs in Alaska. Summary of Impacts The impacts on Alaska's workers compensation system costs due to the changes are summarized in the table below: (A) (B) (C) (D) Impact on Type of Service Share of Medical Costs Impact on Medical Costs Impact on Overall Costs (A) x (B) (C) \u00d7 (2) Physician +0.3% 48.0% +0.1% Ambulance +0.3% 0.8% Negligible Increase (1) Total Impact on Alaska Medical Costs +0.3% (2) Medical Costs as a Percentage of Overall Workers Compensation Benefit Costs in Alaska 72.9% (3) Total Impact on Overall Workers Compensation System Costs in Alaska = (1) x (2) +0.2% 105 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE UPDATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016 Page 1 of 9 Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc.

For the hospital inpatient fee schedule analysis, Medical Data Call for Alaska for Service Year 2013 was used as well. - The share of benefit costs attributed to medical benefits is based on NCCI's Financial Call data for Alaska from the latest 3 policy years projected to the effective date of the benefit changes. 108 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE UPDATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016 Page 4 of 9 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Physician Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for physician services represent 50.0% of total medical payments. To calculate the percentage change in maximums for physician services, NCCI calculates the percentage change in maximum allowable reimbursement (MAR) for each procedure code. The overall change in maximums for physician services is a weighted average of the percentage change in MAR (revised MAR / prior MAR) by procedure code weighted by the observed payments by procedure code as reported on NCCI's Medical Data Call, for Alaska for Service Year 2014. The prior MARs are calculated as follows: Prior MAR = Prior Medicare RVUs x Conversion Factors The revised MARs are calculated as follows: Revised MAR = Revised Medicare RVUs x Conversion Factors Where Prior Medicare RVUs are based on the Calendar Year 2015 version of the Medicare RBRVS publication and the Revised Medicare RVUs are based on the Calendar Year 2016 version. The Conversion Factors are Evaluation and Management $80.00 Medicine [excluding anesthesiology] values for work hardening CPT codes 97545 and 97546 are 3.41 and 1.36, respectively. The overall weighted average percentage change in MARs is 0.0 %. The impact by service category is shown in the table below: 109 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE UPDATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016 Page 5 of 9 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Physician Practice Category Share of Physician Costs Percentage Change in MAR Anesthesia 3.7% 0.0% Physical) 29.2% -0.1% Evaluation and Management 13.8% -0.1% Physician Payments with no specific MAR 7.3% 0.0% Total Physician Costs 100.0% 0.0% Given the above impact of 0.0 % for physician services, the physician fee schedule changes will result in a negligible3 change i n both medical and overall workers compensation system costs in Alaska. Hospital Outpatient Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for hospital outpatient services represent 12.8% of total medical payments . To calculate the percentage change in reimbursements for hospital outpatient services, NCCI calculates the percentage change in prior reimbursement to revised reimbursement for each procedure. The overall change in reimbursements for hospital outpatient services is a weighted average of the percentage change in reimbursements by procedure code weighted by the observed payments by procedure code as reported on NCCI's Medical Data Call, for Alaska for Service Year 2014. The prior reimbursements and revised reimbursements are calculated as follows: Prior Reimbursement For each relevant procedure, Prior Reimbursement = [Prior Relative Weight x Alaska-Specific Conversion Factor + Prior Outlier Amount (if applicable) - Multiple Procedure Discounts (if applicable)] Revised Reimbursement For each relevant procedure, Revised Reimbursement = [Revised Relative Weight x Alaska-Specific Conversion Factor + Outlier Amount (if applicable) - Multiple Procedure Discounts (if applicable)] 3 Negligible is defined in this document to be an impact on overall system costs of less than +/- 0.1%. 110 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE UPDATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016 Page 6 of 9 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Where Alaska-Specific Conversion Factor in both Prior and Revised Reimbursement Formulas = $221.79 The prior reimbursement is based on the Calendar Year 2015 version of Medicare's OPPS publication while the revised reimbursement is based on the Calendar Year 2016 version. The overall weighted-average percentage change in reimbursements for hospital outpatient services is +0.8 %. Since the overall reimbursements for hospital outpatient services increased, the percentage expected to be realized from the fee schedule increase is estimated according to the formula 80% x (1.1 + 1.2 x (price departure)). Since a reliable price departure could not be determined, NCCI assumed a price realization factor of 80%. The impact on hospital outpatient services payments after applying the price realization factor of 8 0% is +0.6 % (= +0.8% x 0.80). The above impact on hospital outpatient payments is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to hospital outpatient payments in Alaska (12.8%) to arrive at the impact on medical costs of +0.1%. The resulting impact on medical costs is then multiplied by the percentage of benefit costs attributed to medical benefits in Alaska (76.1%) to arrive at the impact on overall workers compensation costs in Alaska of +0.1 %. Hospital Inpatient Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for hospital inpatient services represent 12.7% of total medical payments for Service Year 2014. To calculate the percentage change in reimbursements for hospital inpatient services, NCCI calculates the percentage change in prior reimbursement to revised reimbursement for each inpatient hospital episode that is reported with a diagnosis related group ( MS-DRG) procedure code. The overall change in reimbursements for hospital inpatient services is a weighted average of the percentage change in reimbursements for each episode weighted by the observed payments by episode as reported on NCCI's Medical Data Call, for Alaska for Service Years 2013 and 2014 . Two service years are used in order to enhance the reliability of hospital inpatient experience. The prior and revised reimbursements are calculated as follows: Prior Reimbursement Prior Reimbursement = [Prior MS-DRG Weight x Conversion Factor4 + Prior Outlier Amount (if applicable)] Revised Reimbursement Revised Reimbursement = [Revised MS-DRG Weight x Conversion Factor4 + Revised Outlier Amount (if applicable)] 4 This analysis uses a weighted average of the hospital-specific conversion factors weighted by the number of admissions by hospital as reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . 111 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE UPDATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016 Page 7 of 9 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. The Prior MS-DRG weight is based on the Fiscal Year 2015 version of Medicare's Inpatient Prospective Payment System publication. The Revised MS-DRG weight is based on the Fiscal Year 2016 version of the same Medicare publication. The overall weighted average percentage change in reimbursements for hospital inpatient services is -0.6%. Since the overall reimbursements for hospital inpatient services decreased, NCCI expects that 50% of the decrease will be realized on hospital inpatient price levels . The impact on hospital inpatient payments after applying the price realization factor of 50% is -0.3% (= -0.6% x 0.5). The above impact on hospital inpatient costs is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to hospital inpatient payments (12.7%) for Service Year 2014 to arrive at a negligible change in both medical and overall workers compensation costs in Alaska. ASC Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for ASC services represent 10.4% of total medical payments. To calculate the percentage change in reimbursements for ASC services, NCCI calculates the percentage change in prior reimbursement to revised reimbursement for each procedure. The overall change in reimbursements for ASC services is a weighted average of the percentage change in reimbursements by procedure code weighted by the observed payments by procedure code as reported on NCCI's Medical Da ta Call, for Alaska for Service Year 2014. The prior and revised reimbursements are calculated in an analogous manner to the hospital outpatient analysis, except that Medicare has no outlier provision under the ASC fee schedule. The overall weighted average percentage change in reimbursements for ASC services is +5.5%. Since the overall reimbursements for ASC services increased, the percentage expected to be realized from the fee schedule increase is estimated according to the formula 80% x (1.1 + 1.2 x (price departure)). Since a reliable price departure could not be determined, NCCI assumed a price realization factor of 80%. The impact on ASC payments after applying the price realization factor of 80% is +4.4% (= + 5.5% x 0.80) . The above impact on ASC costs is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs attributed to ASC payments in Alaska (10.4%) to arrive at the impact on medical costs of +0.5%. The resulting impact on medical costs is then multiplied by the percentage of benefit costs attributed to medical benefits in Alaska (76.1%) to arrive at the impact on overall workers compensation system costs in Alaska of +0 .4%. DMEPOS Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for DME services subject to the fee schedule represent 1.5% of total medical payments. To calculate the percentage change in maximums for DME, NCCI calculates the percentage change in maximum for each procedure code. The overall change in maximums 112 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE UPDATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016 Page 8 of 9 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. for DMEPOS services is a weighted average of the percentage change in MAR (revised MAR / prior MAR) by procedure code weighted by the observed payments by procedure code. The overall weighted average percentage change in MARs for DMEPOS services is -3.2%. Since the overall average maximum reimbursements for DMEPOS services decreased, NCCI expects that 50% of the decrease would be realized on DMEPOS price levels. The impact on DMEPOS payments after applying the price realization factor of 50% is -1.6% (= -3.2% x 0.50). The above impact is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs subject to the fee schedule attributed to DMEPOS payments in Alaska (1.5%) to arrive at a negligible change i n both medical and overall workers compensation system costs in Alaska. Intrastate Air Ambulance Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for air ambulance services represent 2.0% of total medical payments and 34.8% of air ambulance payments are for intrastate flights. Therefore, the payments for intrastate air ambulance services represent 0.7% (= 2.0% x 34.8%) of medical payments. To calculate the percentage change in reimbursements for intrastate air ambulance services, NCCI calculates the percentage change in prior reimbursement to revised reimbursement for each service. The overall change in reimbursements for air ambulance services is a weighted average of the percentage change in reimbursements by procedure code weighted by the observed payments by procedure code as reported on NCCI's Medical Data Call, for Alaska for Service Year 2014. The overall weighted-average percentage change in reimbursements for intrastate air ambulance services is - 0.2%. Since the overall reimbursements for intrastate air ambulance services decreased, NCCI expects that 50% of the decrease would be realized on air ambulance price levels. The impact on intrastate air ambulance payments after applying the price realization factor of 50% is -0.1% (= -0.2% x 0.50). The above impact on intrastate air ambulance payments is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs subject to the fee schedule attributed to intrastate air ambulance payments in Alaska (0.7%) to arrive at a negligible change in both medical and overall workers compensation system costs in Alaska. Average Sales Price (ASP) Drug Fee Schedule In Alaska, payments for drugs subject to the ASP fee schedule represent 0.2% of total medical payments. To calculate the percentage change in maximums for ASP, NCCI calculates the percentage change in maximum for each ASP drug code. The overall change in maximums fo r ASP services is a weighted average of the percentage change in MAR (revised MAR / prior MAR) by procedure code weighted by the observed payments by ASP drug code. 113 ANALYSIS OF ALASKA MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE UPDATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016 Page 9 of 9 National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. All Rights Reserved. The overall weighted average percentage change in reimbursements for ASP services is +3.4%. Since the overall reimbursements for ASP services increased, the percentage expected to be realized from the fee schedule increase is estimated according to the formula 80% x (1.1 + 1.2 x (price departure)). Since a reliable price departure could not be determined, NCCI assumed a price realization factor of 80%. The impact on ASP payments after applying the price realization factor of 80% is +2.7% (= +3.4% x 0.80). The above impact on ASP payments is then multiplied by the percentage of medical costs subject to the fee schedule attributed to ASP payments in Alaska (0.2%) to arrive at a negligible change in both medical and overall workers compensation system costs in Alaska. Summary of Impacts The impacts on Alaska's workers compensation system costs due to the changes are summarized in the table below: (A) (B) (C) (D) Impact on Type of Service Share of Medical Costs Impact On Medical Costs Impact on Overall Costs (A) x (B) (C) \u00d7 (2) Physician 0.0% 50.0% 0.7% Negligible ASP +2.7% 0.2% Negligible (1) Total Impact on Alaska Medical Costs +0.6% (2) Medical Costs as a Percentage of Overall Workers Compensation Benefit Costs in Alaska 76.1% (3) Total Impact on Overall Workers Compensation System Costs in Alaska = (1) x (2) +0.5% 114TAB 8 April 2, 2019 Email from Carla Gee at Optum regarding Hearing aid/services fees : Hi All, Montana is silent on hearing aids/services but I've provided its fee schedule below along with Wyoming's per the list Misty provided. Wyoming's narrative of 'invoice +30 %' is what the MSRC used as its basis last year for the hearing aid rule. I've also attached other state information on hearing aids; it is what I provided Marie last year (and is based on 2018 schedules). Montana is able to value codes that Alaska does not as it adopts Optum's gap -fill values (Optum develops relative values for many of the codes that are not valued under RBRVS). Wyoming uses Relative Values for Physicians which also provides relative values for some of the codes listed below in which RB RVS does not. I could check NCCI's data, however, it won't show shift from 2018 to 2019 as the most current full year information available is 2017.
