So, [naturopathic medicine](https://www.nycintegrative.com/naturopathic-medicine/) focuses on and advances natural healing. Our bodies have the unique capacity for self-healing. Our Naturopathic Physician, [Dr. Robert Kachko](https://www.nycintegrative.com/meet-dr-robert-kachko/), acknowledges and honors this innate ability. He thoroughly assesses your medical history and health concerns to uncover the \"root\" cause of troubling symptoms and debilitating conditions. With this information, Dr. Kachko will work with you to develop a comprehensive plan. So, you get well-and stay that way. Just as you are constantly evolving, changing, and growing as a person, the techniques and treatments available to restore your health and well-being are not static. Fundamental to the naturopathic process and our holistic, integrative approach is the notion of providing the right medicine to the right person at the right time. We do not \"shoehorn\" you into the likes of prescription medications, which may only provide symptom relief (but fail to address the underlying or root causes of those symptoms). With our highly individualized program, we can pull from an array of potential treatments and techniques to \"balance\" your body and brain. After all, symptoms such as pain or sleeplessness are signs of imbalances. Following a thorough intake process and lab tests that are ordered with your particular needs at heart, Dr. Kachko may recommend: We at the NY Center for Integrative Health like to say that we take the \"best\" from naturopathic, functional, conventional, and Chinese medicine to create a truly holistic program that works. We do not limit ourselves to cutting-edge western medicine. In turn, there is sure to be a personalized, targeted therapeutic program that gets you physically, mentally, and emotionally feeling your best. We listen to your needs and what your body is \"telling us\" via our range of diagnostic techniques and testing. That way, when we deliver on a treatment plan, your overall health and wellness are supported in the short-term and sustained for life. This is a true partnership and tenet of our multi-faceted approaches to medicine.
