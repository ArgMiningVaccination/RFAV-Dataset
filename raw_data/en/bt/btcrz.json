Acknow ledgements We thank the staff at the Cape Hatteras Na tional Seashore headquart ers in Manteo for their helpful suggestions and support of this pr oject, m ost notably Doug Stover, Steve Harrison, Toni Duffic y, Steve Ryan, and Mary Doll. The fo llowing s taff of the Nort h Carolina Division of Marine F isheries shared m aps, statistics, a nd illu strations : Scott Chappell, Rodney Guajardo, Trish Murphy, Don Hesselm an, Dee Lupton, Alan Bian chi, and Richard Davis. Assistants in the field provided quality interviews and valuable in sights into village life - Susan W est, Jennifer Miller, and Julie Burke. Special thanks also go to Susan W est for pr oviding m eals and lodging in support of this project. Stephanie Bodine , Carol Filby, Sandra Kellum , and LaVern Reels transcribed our interviews. The staff at the History Center in Mant eo, th e Hatte ras village library, and the Ocracok e Preserv ation Society o ffered enthusiastic help. Outer Banks historian David Stick was kind enough to proof-read the hi storical section of this work despite his struggles with glaucom a. Danny Couch of Buxton was willing to m ake tim e in his busy schedule to share his wealth of knowledge about village history. Karen Duggan with the Cape Lookout National Seashore headquarters, Pam Morris with the Core Sound Waterfowl Museum and Heritage Center, and Sally A nger all helped scan photographs and maps. Conversations with the Cedar Island - Ocracoke ferry staff were insi ghtful and fun, as the ferry workers tend to be former fisherm en and island residents. Most im portantly, we thank the m any Hattera s and Ocracoke Island villagers who took the tim e to share their storie s, thoughts, and suggestions; wi thout helpf ulness this p roject would not have been possible. This report, however, owes a special debt to the ef forts of the Nationa l Park Service Applied Ethnography Program , particularly Dr. J. Anthony Paredes, Regional Ethnographer and Chief of the Ethnography and Indian Affairs Br anch, Southeast Regional Office, for its design, structure, an d content - the value an d utility of the repor t to f uture s taff, residen ts, and visito rs to the Cape Hatteras National Seashore is due in large part to his s upport and initiative. Thanks m ust also be given to Dee Sm ith-Wilson, our Contracting Officer, to Dan Scheidt, the Division Ch ief of Cultural Resourc es, and Kirk Cordell, his predecessor, to Paul Hartwig, the Associated Regional Directo r for Cultural Reso urces, to Regional Director Patricia Hooks, and to the Southeast Regional Cultural Resources Council for recommending the project for funding and for their persiste nt support of the program . Finally, the principal investigator, John S. Petterson, m ust acknowle dge the efforts of Barbara Garrity -Blake, the lead et hnographer and lead au thor of the report, for devoting years of her tim e to m aking this project such a success. The quality of the study is prim arily a result of her work, and the devotion of Laura Stanley to the num erous editorial revisions. i2. Executive S ummary This document results from a three-year long research project funded by the National Park Service beginning in 2002 to conduct an et hnohistorical and ethnogr aphic study of eight communities adjacent to the Cape Hatteras Nati onal Seashore (CAHA). This study grew out of the National Park Service's recognition of the im portance of understanding the social, cultural, and economic his tories o f comm unities affected b y its policies and actions; its purpo se was to \"support the Park in the interpretation of its cu ltural resources, stew ardship of ethnographic sources within the Park, a nd in community relations w ith these Park neighbors.\" Research m ethods included participant-obser vation in Hatteras and Ocracoke villages, social apping, genealogical interviews, and ex tended, tape-recorded inte rviews of community elders and leaders. W e also built upon interviews of residents who born before or near the turn of the century that were recorded in the 1970s an d 1980s by National Park Service staff as part of the University of North Carolina's S outhern Oral Hi story Project. In some cases we were able to interview th e child ren of those in terviewed in earlier decades, now deceas ed. These in terviews helped us form ulate a diachronic description of social and cultural change in Outer Bank villages, pa rticularly relating to the in terpr etive th emes of Cape Hatte ras N ationa l Seas hore: seashore living and fishing econom y. The final docum ent is divided into three m ain components: A description of contemporary life on the Outer Banks, including dem ographic changes, cha llenge s and issues faced by trad itional banker co mmunities, and a discussion of the role of the National Park Servic e in village r life (Chapter 6). This section includes a discussion of m anagem ent issues and recommendations. An ethnohistorical description of the eight villages adjoining Ca pe Hatteras National Seashore: R odanthe, uxton, Frisco, Hatteras, and Ocracoke. This is the m ain body of th e text, and includes an overall history of Hatteras and iiOcracoke Islands (Chapter 5), as well as sp ecific ethnohistories of the six other villages (Chapter 7), and is based prim arily o n record ed interv iews. Interpretive them es of hi story and heritage. This section offers inform ation pertaining to ten inte rpretive them es identif ied by Nati onal Park Service staff. The purpose of this section is to provide a reference guide for Park interpreters who are developing program s about the cu ltural m eanings of artifacts, places, o r events in Ban ker history. We have included as m uch prim ary source inform ation for each of these them es as possible, and included secondary source references as well. In addition to the m ain docum ent described a bove, we have com piled the oral histories record ed an d transc ribed for this pr oject in a se parate docu ment. These inte rviews will be m ade available to National Park personne l as well as the public. They should be studied in conjunction with the interviews from the 1970s and 1980s conducted by National Park staff and Southern Oral Histo ry Project res earchers. Th ese in terviews are file at the His tory Center in Manteo, and at the Cape Hatteras National Seas hore headquarters in Manteo. Al so useful to any research of Outer Banks culture and history is an annotated bibliography of coastal research com piled by Betty Duggan (2001), which was undertaken as a precursor to this project. iii iv3.0 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1.

Introduction In collecting interviews for an ethnohistory of the Outer Banks-that is, a history through the eyes and memories of comm unity members-we found that Hatt eras and Ocracoke Islanders did not necessarily relish a lot of questions, particular ly from strangers working on a project for the federal government. Fortunately, however, this reluctance was counterbalanced with hospitality, curios ity, and humor. Islanders are sorely aware of the pressures brought to bear on their communities, and have eloquently and gruffly expressed their concerns at county commission meetings, community planning sessions, fisheries hearings, National Park Service meetings, in letters and editorials to newspapers, and internet chat r ooms. Although some people politely declined to speak to us, many took the time to patiently answ er our questions and sh are thoughts and stories above and beyond what we asked. Some wondered why we would be interested in talking to them, and others seemed to recognize that their place on these fast-changing islands could become as invisible as an unmark ed grave if not recorded. Ocracoke and Hatteras Islanders have a l ong track-record of graciously hosting off-island visitors who have frequented the Banks since the late 1800s to hunt, fish, bathe, and rest. They have exchanged information and stor ies with these visitors; they also have a history of traveling off-island for work, school, and military service. So, today's tendency to be reclusive during the tourist season or to express fatigue at yet anothe r request for information is not necessarily part of the \"island character\" or a trad ition of reticence. Ra ther, it is more an outgrowth of living in an overwhelmingly crowded and expensive tourist-destination replete with an ever-increasing barrage of rules, restrictions, and managers. Perhaps for this very reason people were willing to sit down and describe a different life that they once knew, a different community that they helped shape, and a different quality of culture on the Banks. 4.1. Background The Cape Hatteras National Seashore (CAHA) represents the m iddle and farthest-flung boundary of the 172-m ile Outer Banks region of No rth Carolina. Arcing out into the Atlantic Ocean som e 30 m iles fro m the m ainland, the barr ier island s of Hatteras an d Ocracoke appear impossibly narrow and vulnerable. Yet, the region has long supported inhabitants; first American In dians, th en English se ttlers. Today, descendants of ear ly settlers continue to liv e and work on the Banks, but share the sandy spit with a staggering num ber of tourists, second-hom e vacationers/investors, u rban expatriates, a nd labo rers im ported from other countries. Since the 19 53 estab lishment of Cape Hatte ras N ationa l Seas hore, the n ation's f irst national seashore park, the National Park Servi ce has com e to be neighbor, friend, and nem esis to residents of Hatteras and Ocracoke. On the one hand, Bankers are than kful that the federal governm ent has protected m uch of Hatteras and Ocracoke from comm ercial developm ent. On the other hand, they resent som e of the manage ment policies and practices that the Park Service has im posed on their lives. Nevertheless, the histor ic sites, artifacts, and natura l areas that the Park Servic e maintains a re of deep s ymbolic si gnificance to the village rs and provide tangible links to their not-too -distant past. In 2001, the National Park Service, descri bing the eight villages as \"living exponents of the hum an history and maritim e cultures\" of Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands, called for an ethnograph ic and ethnoh istorical stu dy to bett er understand the neighboring communities along the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. A prim ary inte nt of this research is to \"support the park in 2 the interpretation of its cultural resources, stewar dship of ethnographic s ources within the park, and in community relations with these park nei ghbors.\" Inf ormation collected for this research will help preserve th e past and docu ment the dynam ic, changing culture that is an ou tgrowth of that past. B etter integration of ethnographic data with the cult ural interpretation of sites and artifacts will result in a \" living h istory\" that is inclusive of m odern day villagers. A deeper understanding of and appreciati on for the cultural resources of Hatteras and Ocracoke should also help improve relations between the Park and Bank dwellers. 4.2. Goals and Objectives One goal of this r esearch was to colle ct information and m aterials that would contribute to the existing inventory of oral histories, interviews, photogra phs, and maps pertaining to the culture and history of the eight villages adjoining the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. This inform ation enables us to establish a baseline characterizatio n of is land life before m ajor transform ations began taking place, so that triggers of change at various points in history could be identif ied and tra ced in rela tion to present d ay communitie s. Another goal of this project was to develop a diachronic description of social and cultural change, particularly pertaining to the interpre tive them e of \"se ashore living and a fishing econom y.\" There is, of course, no such thing as a static period of tim e, and the curve of social transform ation is dram atically steeper at so me points than others. For example, the establishm ent of a paved road and bridge c onnecting Hatteras Island to the m ainland brought about a faster-paced life and num erous other changes for islanders . The cyclical nature of various fisheries has an im pact on island life, as do m ajor fisheries policy shifts. Among features 3 that rem ain constan t is the regi on's vulnerability to \"Mother Na ture,\" including Hurricane Is abel which devastated Hatteras village in 2003. Considering the lev el of tourism , real esta te sales, and developm ent today, the prim ary question tha t has em erged f rom this projec t is th is: at wha t point do com munities los e the ab ility to maintain their coh esiveness and distinc tiven ess? Before this que stion can be addressed, numerous other questions m ust be asked such as : what defines a comm unity? What holds a community together? Are the social and economic forces changing the nature of Outer Banks life underm ining traditional comm unities, helping m aintain them , or both? Are community and village boundaries the sam e? What does a community display, and what does it hide? W hat is turned into a commodity to be sold, and what is prot ected a t all cos ts? Is it possible to define and describe an Outer Banks culture? 4.3. Methods The collection of oral histories and interv iews from January of 2002 to May of 2004 was central to this project. R esearchers interviewed long-term island residents who had mem ories of Hatteras or Ocracoke before the National Seasho re was estab lished in ord er to ex amine the contrast bef ore and after the arrival of the Park. We were also interested in the transition period when the concept of a National Seashore was introduced and vill agers relinquished control and ownership of property to the governm ent. Alt hough interviews were loosely structured, the following prom pts were used: Could you tell m e about your fa mily history? (Where/when born, parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, children, occupations, etc.); What was your experience growi ng up here? (School, c hurch, revivals, baptism s, fune rals, weddings, pastim e for kids and teens, gam es/ toys, travel off island/ between villages, hom e 4 remedies, meals, chores, dating, jobs, neighbor s, stores, storm s, house, gardens, pets, livestock, cars, boats); Are there particular m embers of the community who stand out in your m ind as you were growing up ? (Teachers, preachers, midwives, doctors, lifesavers, m usician s, community leaders, firem en, counse lors, Do you remem ber any are no longer here? (Salvaging, boatbuilding, yaupon tea, seaweed harvesting, styles of fishing); Can you describe the activities or work that have stood th e test of tim e and are still practiced? (Fishing, hunting guide s, visiting, gardening, etc.); What did the village and the surrounding ar ea look like when you were growing up? (Village size and layout, road s, trees, dunes, etc.); What was/is the re lation ship of this village to th e other v illages of Hatte ras Is land an d Ocracoke? (Dependencies, rivalr ies, trade, rituals , etc.); How is this village different from surrounding villages, and how is it sim ilar? (What \"sets it off,\" m akes it unique, and what do villages have in common? ); What kind of things have brought change to the way of life in this village and how has it changed village life? (Transportation, electric ity/water, telephone, cab le, internet, fishing regulations, alcohol, drugs, m oney, t ourism ); What \"watershed\" events m ost affected village life, and how? (Women's vote, Depression, WW II, Civil Rights, establishm ent of the Park); What features of this area have special m eaning to you? (e.g., family burials, hom eplace, remnants of the past, gathering places, swim hole s, harbor). 5 We recorded m ost of the interviews, and paid repeat visits to m any of the island ers. W e also undertook inform al, non-recorded intervie ws. W e used the m ethod of participant- observation during field work, accompanying fisherm en, attending festivals and co mmunity events, and observing p ublic f isheries hear ings a nd m eetings. Villag ers helped us m ap out the local nam es of s mall creeks, sloughs, cuts, and isla nds. W e did aerial surveys of the region with local pilots. W e photographed resi dents, hom es, graves, hurricane-da maged areas, and artifacts. We also incorporated Census records, land use plans, and other secondar y sources to provide a demographic histo ry of the Hatte ras and Ocracok e 4.4. Organiz ation of Ethnohist ories and Interpretive Themes The following ethnohistories are organized as if one were traveling down the Banks north to south: from Rodanthe to Ocracoke. They are b ased first an d fore most on oral histories gathered during the course of this project, those gathered in 1988 by University of North Carolina's S outhern Oral Histor y Project, and a variety of inte rviews undertaken in the 1970s and 1980s by Park Service personnel. The categor ies within each ethnoh istory (e.g., times\") from the topics addressed in the in terviews. A major challenge in writing th ese ethnohist ories was avoidin g redundancy from village to village. In som e respects we are describ ing eight version s of the same story. Yet, each villag e is unique in the par ticular families an d individu als m aking up the comm unity, and the particula r experiences and stor ies they tell. For exam ple, all eigh t communities ha ve a his tory of waterf owl hunting, fishing, m eeting the m ail boat, and so on. But, we focused on details such as who m et 6 the m ail boat, where particular villagers hunte d, and how the community's location shaped how fisherm en went about their work. We prefaced the ethnoh istories with a hist orical and m Hatteras and Ocracoke to provide a fram ework and context for the eight villag e descriptions. Although oral histories were central to the village ethnographies, we rounded them out with other sources where needed, including inform al interviews, sc holarly publications, and newspaper articles. Participant-observation allowed us to experience first-hand m any of the observations m ade in interviews; this m ethod serves, when possible, as a check for interview validity. Indispensable to any study of the Outer B anks is the work of David Stick, Gary Dunbar, Roger Payne, Alton Ballance, D anny Couch, Nancy Van Dolsen, and Walt W olfram/ Natalie S hilling-Estes. The National Park Service headquarters fo r the C ape Hatteras National Seashore in Manteo provided the ethnographic team with several interpretive them es (Chapter Seven) to explore. These them es were then develope d for the purpose of providing infor mational and reference m aterials to P ark Service interprete rs who wish to create presentations, displays, demonstrations, or other such interp retive program s for Park visitors. 7 5.0. History of Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands 5.1. The Colonial Period: Stockmen Beginnings The first written account of the Outer Banks was by Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524. Verrazzano, navigator for a French expedition, fam ously m istook Pam lico Sound for the Pacific Ocean (\"oriental sea\"), separated from the Atlantic only by a thin strip of sandy bank; Europeans accepted this as fact for the next 150 years (Stick 1958). Verrazzano anchored off what was likely Hatteras Island and deployed a boat of 25 m en in search of fresh water. W hen a \"large num ber of native people\" appeared on the beach to m eet them , the crew stopped short of the surf and sent a m an to shore to offer trinkets (ibid, 12). The m an tossed the gifts toward the natives and attem pted to swim back to the boat, but the surf sent him tumbling to the beach repeatedly. The Indians hauled him to dry sand, built a fire, rem oved his clothes, and exam ined his white skin. W hen the sailor recovered his strength, the natives hugged him and sent him back into the surf where he successfully joined his com panions (Stick 1958). Sir W alter Raleigh of England organized three expeditions to the Banks region in the mid-1580s in search of a prim e site for settlem ent. A group of English m en, wom en, and children settled on Roanoke Island in 1587. The settlers sent one ship back with Governor John White to England for supplies, but W hite was unable to return to Roanoke Island until 1590 because of England's war with Spain. Upon his return, the fort was in disarray, and there was no sign of the settlers or their bodies; just \"CRO\" and \"CROATOAN\" carved in two trees. The fate of the \"lost colony\" was unknown; John W hite speculated that they joined the \"friendly Indians at Croatoan, now Hatteras Island,\" but this and later theories have never been substantiated (Stick 1958, 20). 8 Legend has it that the f irst white settlers on the Outer Banks were castaways, cutthroats, pirates, and wreckers. Although the region's inaccessibility due to treacherous waters and shoals made it ideal for those seeking a hideout, early settlers were stockm en and sm all landholders, the great m ajority of whom were \"poor but respect able yeom an who saw an opportunity to acquire, generally for the taking, land for a hom estead\" (Dunbar 1956, 39) and who were \"trying to gain a foothold in the new colony\" (Stick 1958, 24): Their habitations were alm ost invariably situated in the wooded ham mocks on the sound side, where they could find building sites in close proxim ity to the sloughs and creeks in which their boats were kept and where they were protected from the strong winds on the back of the beach and the high tides which periodically flooded the m arsh (Stick 1958, 24-25). The earliest recorded m ention of livestock on the Banks was a 1710 petition to settle stock near Ocracoke Inlet. The island was owned by Richard Sanderson of Perquim ans County who bequeathed \"Ye Island of Ocreecock, with all the stock of horses, sheep, cattle, and hoggs\" to his son in 1733 (Dunbar 1956, 38). By 1722 m uch of the Outer Banks had been granted to or claim ed by noblem en, squatters, ranchers, and investors: The land grants on the Banks during the colonial period were often very large, necessarily so for the purpose of stock raising...it should be rem embered that the ownership represented by grants and deeds did not always m ean control or occupation of the land. Presum ably m any of the early settlers acquired their property m erely by settling on it (Dunbar 1956, 39). Settlers f rom Virginia or the North Carolina m ainland m ade their hom e in the hum mocks on the Sound side of the Banks, protected from the ocean winds and seas (Dunbar 1956, 40). They lived in sm all, scattered settlem ents with large, f enced gardens and f ree-ranging livestock. Settlers supplem ented their living with subsistence fishing and waterfowl hunting as well as shoreline scavenging (ibid). They built windm ills in the 1720s for grinding corn, obtained from plantations in areas such as Stum py Point, in exchange for fresh fish, salted fish, and oysters 9 (Stick 1958; W echter 1975). They also built fish cam ps along the ocean beach and hunting blinds along m arshes. They built one and a half or two story houses, one room deep \"with outside end chim neys and a central hallway\" typical of the m id-Atlantic style of the 17th and 18th centuries (Dunbar 1956, 40-41). During the early 1700s, a sm all group of about 80 Indians lived in the Cape W oods along the Sound, and were likely of the sam e Hatteras or Hatterask culture encountered by Verrazanno's expedition 200 years earlier. The Hatteras Indians were part of the Croatan Chiefdom , classified as northern coastal Al gonkian-speakers (W ard and Davis 1999, 194). The archaeological record suggests that the Hatteras had the only perm anent settlem ents on the Island during this period, com pared to the tem porary hunting and fishing cam ps of the Coree and Machapungas along the Banks. But the Hatteras Indians did not fare well with the newcom ers to the Banks, and by 1715 were described as being \"in great poverty\" (Dunbar 1956, 40). In 1733 a cartographer reported that there were \"6 or 8 (Indians) at Hatteras, who dwell am ong the English\" (Dunbar 1956, 40). Mixed-blood individuals of European and Native Am erican stock were known as \"Mustees.\" Early settlers took part in subsistence fishing as well as lim ited com mercial fishing, trading salted fish for corn to m ainland plantations. W haling developed on Core Banks and Shackleford Banks to the south after the Lords Proprietors tried to induce \"New England whalers to settle in the province\" (Stick 1958, 33). But whales were \"not the object of a boat fishery\" on Hatteras and Ocracoke. Bankers did, however, but cher and dry whales and dolphins that were \"cast on shore\" (Dunbar 1956:, 41). They also \"[availed] them selves of the tim bers and cargoes of wrecked ships,\" not considering it stealing but rather as m aking use of that which was unclaim ed (ibid, 55). Their reputation as \"wreckers or land pirates\" who lured ships to ruin and 10 robbed them of cargo is the result of fanciful im agination, exaggeration, and is wholly undeserved (Dunbar 1956, 42). Ocracoke Inlet becam e an official port of entry to Bath Town in 1715. Ocracoke village, originally m apped as Pilot Town, was officially settled around 1743 by British governm ent workers assigned the duty of piloting vessels through the strategically im portant inlet (Stick 1958; Payne 1985). Both Ocracoke and Portsm outh, the largest towns of the period, served as gateway outposts for trade to m ainland com munities. The practice of \"lightering,\" or transferring cargo to shallow draft boats, enabled goods to be shipped across Pam lico Sound to river towns such as W ashington, New Bern, or Edenton (Dunbar 1956). Lightering m ade smuggling easier, as it enabled pilots to offload goods in sm all settlem ents, thereby avoiding custom s fees charged at the ports of Bath, Edenton, and Currituck (Dunbar 1956, 45). Piracy becam e prevalent off the North Carolina coast in the early 1700s, reaching its heyday with the exploits of Edward Teach or \"B lackbeard.\" Teach enjoyed the seclusion of the North Carolina's islands, estuaries and rivers. He com mandeered a fleet of four vessels and a crew of som e 400 pirates. His operation was re sponsible for the capture of twenty-five ships between 1716 and 1718. In autum n of 1718, after receiving a pardon from the royal Governor Eden in Bath, Teach \"found\" a French ship and divided the booty with Governor Eden and Governm ent Secretary Tobias Knight. Outraged Carolinians turned to Virginia Governor Alexander Spotswood for help, and he responded by dispatching two British warships. Robert Maynard's crew engaged Teach' s crew on the Adventure in battle at Ocracoke Inlet Novem ber 22, 1718; the subsequent death of Blackbeard m arked the end of piracy's short-lived golden age in North Carolina (Stick 1958). 11 The Banks rem ained relatively peaceful until 1741 when England and Spain went to war. A Spanish tent town was erected on Ocracoke, and Spaniards harassed passing vessels, burned houses, and killed cattle. Conflicts with Spaniards continued in various form s until Tarheels (North Carolinians) petitioned for fortification along coast. \"All the sea banks (are) covered with cattle, sheep, and hogs,\" a writer observed in 1776, expressing the concern that British vessels would find a ready supply of fresh meat during the Revolutionary W ar (Dunbar 1956, 43). On April 14, 1776, warfare cam e to the Banks when the arm ed British sloop Lilly crossed Ocracoke Bar and approached the m erchant schooner Polly . Lilly's crew, along with those of its sister ship Fincastle , captured and looted the Polly in front of Ocracoke pilots. Before daybreak, the Fincastle weighed anchor and went to sea. But the Ocracoke pilots rowed out to the Lilly and took the captain and crew prisoner. They transferred the British gang to Edenton where they were tried and found guilty. Recognizing the vulnerability of inlets, the North Carolina Provincial Congress approved the establishm ent of five independent com panies of troops up and down the coast. British raids continued near Ocracoke Inlet, however, until the Ocracoke Militia Com pany was f ormed from 1779-1783; Bankers recognized that they could m ost effectively protect the inlet (Stick 1958). Islanders willingly signed up f or militia duty, but were exem pt from having to serve in distant expeditions because of the likelihood of a local raid (Dunbar 1956). Ocracoke Inlet was the passageway of m uch North Carolina and Virginia trade, and its security was a top priority. Hatteras Inlet was too shallow to be of any im portance, and filled com pletely by 1755, joining Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands to com prise one long bank. An Ocracoke Inlet pilot lived in Hatteras Village and walked to work af ter the Inlet was f illed. The Hatteras Inlet was reopened by a hurricane in the fall of 1846 (Stick 1958, 296). 12 \"Settlem ent sites...in Colonial days were the sam e as those of the present,\" wrote geographer Gary Dunbar (1956, 47), \"wooded ham mocks on the sound side.\" Dunbar challenged the notion that the Banks were covered from end to end in thick forest, m aintaining that stum ps exposed by storm s along the beach at Chicam acom ico indicate that the beach once lay further to the east, not that trees once grew on the beach (Dunbar 1956, 64). \"A 'beach forest'... cannot exist because wind-borne salt spray would prevent it\" (ibid). He also questions claim s that livestock denuded forest and vegetation, as well as the idea that Bankers them selves deforested the area. A 1795 description supports his contention that the Banks were never carpeted in f orest: The coast (beach) from Occacock to Cape Hatteras is sandy and barren...Cape Hatteras and the land from it toward Occacock, to the distance of about thirteen m iles, are covered with large evergreen trees, such as live oak, pine and cedar. Here are three large and remarkable sand hills, called Stowe's (present Styron) Hills. The coast af terward is a bald beach, interspersed with a few low sand hills; about eleven m iles farther is a group of trees, called the Six Mile Ham mock, from its distance from Occacock - from thence the coast is quite barren and sandy (Dunbar 1956, 63-64). 4.2. The Federal Period (1780 to 1865): Shipw recks and War About 1,000 people were living on the Banks by the end of the Revolutionary W ar in 1783 and the last reference to the Hatteras Indians was in a 1788 deed from \"'Mary Elks, Inden, of Hatteras Banks' to Nathan Midyett for a track of land which included the site of the old Indian town\" (Stick 1958, 73). After Independence \"there was a brisk trade in Outer Banks real estate\" (ibid: 74). Slave ownership was m inimal but present (Stick 1958). Although larger Ocracoke landowners, like those of Hatteras Island, owned slaves, \"racial boundaries were confused on the Outer Banks, where islanders...heeded the less rigid racial m ores of shipboard life m ore than those of tidewater plantations or inland ports\" (Cecelski 2001, 50). Records indicate that 13 children of free black W illiam Meekins owned 140 acres at Cape Hatteras and 50 acres at \"Kinnakeet Banks\" in the late 1700s (Cecelski 2001, 238). After Independence, ship traffic grew along the Atlantic seaboard. Federal authorities, alarm ed at the growing num ber of shipwrecks off the Outer Banks, authorized the first lighthouses in 1794, including Cape Hatteras in Buxton and Shell Castle Island in Ocracoke. The Ocracoke Shell Castle Island lighthouse was built on a spit of oyster shells and put into use in 1798. The Shell Castle light becam e useless when the channel shifted away, so in 1820 Congress appropriated $14,000 to replace it with a lightship. In 1822 $20,000 dollars was approved to build the present day 65 foot-high lighthouse in Ocracoke (Cecelski 2001, 303). Cape Hatteras lighthouse was built near Buxton and put into operation by 1802. It was 120 feet in length from its underground stone foundation to the dom e roof. Shipwrecks continued to occur, however, and ship captains com plained about the dim ness and low visibility of the light. In 1852 a newly form ed Lighthouse Board reported criticism s that Cape Hatteras was \"a disgrace to our country\" and represented the \"m ost im portant\" and \"worst light in the world\" (Stick 1958, 186; 289). Congress appropriated 15,000 dollars to fit the lighthouse with a new lens and lantern, and to elevate the structure to 150 feet, a task which was com pleted in 1854. A Buxton resident recalled that the light was \"a beautiful lam p, made up of twenty-four beautiful prism s,\" (Toth et al. 1973, 47). He also r ecalled that the last keeper of the old light was Junius Jennette, who had to \"pull five gallons of to the top\" or \"wreck auctions,\" form alized in 1801. The North Carolina General Assem bly passed a bill that established wreck com missioners and wreck districts (Dunbar 1956). Coastal counties were directed to appoint two or m ore \"discreet and proper persons\" as commissioners, who would \"collect as m any m en as necessary to go to the assistance of vessels 14 in distress and to take custody of the vessels and goods until reasonable rewards were paid to the salvers by the owner of the vessel or by the m erchant whose goods were saved\" (ibid, 70). The vendue or public sale was held if goods went \"unclaim ed for a year\" (Dunbar 1956, 70). Interested parties would com e from mainland areas to vendues, and Bankers also participated in the bidding. Money from the sales was deposited with the county clerk of court. Anyone finding \"stranded property\" had to report it to the com missioner, and hiding stranded property resulted in a fine equal or double the value of the goods (ibid). A crooked wreck com missioner could be fined three tim es the value of the goods; thus, there was m ore incentive for islanders to get paid to be a salver or to bid on cheap item s than to abscond with cargo (Dunbar 1956). \"The econom y of the Bankers in the Federal period was not vastly different from that of colonial tim es,\" concluded Dunbar, \"the great changes were to com e after the Civil W ar\" (1956, 70). By the m id-19th century there were about eight windm ills for grinding corn on Hatteras Island and three on Ocracoke, a num ber that prom pted a visitor to rem ark \"There are greater number than I supposed were in existence in the whole county\" (Dunbar 1956, 73). They included \"Howard's W windm ills in Hatteras, \"Jennet's Mill\" in Buxton, two in Avon, two in W aves and one in Rodanthe (Dunbar 1956, 98). They were the \"post m ill\" or Germ an style where the relatively sm all and short body of the m ill was \"pushed round by hand to face the wind by m eans of a tail pole\" (Dunbar 1956, 99). By 1904 only Avon had a m ill still in service. During the 19th century through the Civil W ar period Bankers collected and prepared yaupon, a wild holly, for tea. During the W ar, yaupon tea enjoyed widespread popularity as a substitute for hard-to-find coffee. Som e Frisco residents were able to m arket their yaupon to the mainland. After the war yaupon tea-drinking declined sharply, and those who m ade and drank it 15 \"were looked down upon as people who could not afford im ported tea\" (Dunbar 1956, 102). Dunbar points out those occupations requiring little effort, or that depend on the gathering of easy-to-find m aterials such as yaupon bushes, tend to have low status: \"People tend to look down upon those who m ake a business of gathering and selling any item which can be so easily procured\" (Dunbar 1956, 102). Bankers were renowned for their am bivalent allegiances during the Civil W ar, and were called \"opportunists\" by Confederate troops who com plained that they raised white flags to the \"house-tops on the approach of either Confeder ates or Federals\" (Stick 1958, 155). If anything Bankers expressed Union leanings, given their s eafaring history and the key role the federal governm ent had played in establishing lighthouses and forts. \"Bankers could not have m uch sympathy with the revolt against a governm ent which had been their constant friend,\" wrote a Union officer (cited in Stick 1958, 155). Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands fell under Federal control early in the war. Although Ocracoke Inlet was, by 1861, less strategic than Hatteras Inlet, a sm all regim ent of Confederate troops that m anned Fort Ocracoke on Beacon Island pr otected it. But, federal forces blocked the Inlet by sinking schooners in 1861, and went on to establish a regim ent at Live Oak Cam p in Chicam acom ico. Confederates later attacked this position; chasing Union troops southward on foot down the beach to Cape Hatteras. The Rebels, noting that the whole com munity of Chicam acom ico did not rejoice at Confederate arrival but abandoned their hom es and fled after Union troops, took this as evidence that Bankers were loyal to the Union. The next day, federal reinforcem ents arrived and drove the Confederates back up the Banks again - this event thus becam e known as the \"Chicam acom ico Races.\" Fort Hatteras and Fort Clark at Hatteras Inlet 16 had suffered bom bardm ent from four Union ships and were captured as well, securing the region under Union com mand (Stick 1958, 117-136). Under Federal occupation som e 1,200 people lived on Hatteras Island including alm ost 100 slaves (Stick 1958, 154). W ithin ten days of Union forces landing, \"nearly all of the m ale adults had taken the oath of allegiance\" to the United States. A visiting preacher found congregations along the island to be half \"National soldiers\" and half \"natives of North Carolina\" (ibid, 156). Anti-secessionists charged North Carolina leaders with treason in decreeing secession. Following a convention on Hatteras Island, North Carolina leaders set up a provisional governm ent declaring Hatteras to be the capital North Carolina. The provisional Governor, a Hatteras preacher, called for elections in the Second Congressional District, whereby Charles Henry Foster of Hatteras was elected to the House of Representatives. In Washington, D.C., the case of Foster was referred to a com mittee on elections and declared invalid (Stick 1958, 157-158). The Bankers' allegiance to the federal governm ent alienated them from mainland trading partners: \"their m arket for fish...was cut off, and they no longer had the buying power - or m ore accurately, the trading power - to secure corn and other foodstuffs across the sound\" (Stick 1958, 159). They m anaged to find em ploym ent tending to the needs of soldiers, however, as well as addressing a shortage of tea with yaupon production, and had no need for offers of charity from Yankee benefactors. Upon the war's end, Hatteras and Ocracoke villagers had \"little dif ficulty adjusting to the new order,\" as there had been \"little slave ownership on the Banks before the war\" (Stick 1958, 166). 17 4.3. Moderniz ation (Post Civil War - Post World War II) As outsiders cam e into contact with Outer Banks com munities, the villagers gained a reputation for their idiosyncrasies and independence. A Confederate officer had com plained that islanders \"m ingle but little with the world; apparently indif ferent to this outside sphere, they constitute a world within them selves\" (Stick 1958, 155). Another observer characterized Bankers as \"Queer folks (who)...get their living by fishing, gathering oysters, wrecking, and piloting. Most of them were born here, never saw another locality and all are happy\" (ibid). Bankers were indeed happy during Reconstruction, as the Federal Governm ent \"was preparing to distribute the first in...a steady flow of vouchers and pay checks\" for jobs in \"new lighthouses, lifesaving stations, weather stations, and post offices\" (Stick 1958, 168). It was \"as if the Bankers were being rewarded for their wartim e loyalty with steady jobs\" (Stick 1958, 168). The U.S. Lifesaving Service built seven lifesaving stations along North Carolina' s coast by 1875, including one at Chicam acom ico and Little Kinnakeet, adding m ore governm ent jobs for barrier island villagers. Station keepers were paid $200 dollars a year to supervise six surfm en during a Decem ber through March duty. The m en, receiving $40 dollars a m onth and $3 dollars per shipwreck, slept six in one room in sm all wooden stations. They m anned watchtowers in search of foundering vessels or flares, and took shifts walking the beach 24 hours a day, meeting Surfm en from neighboring stations and ex changing tokens to prove that the full beat was covered (Stick 1958). During the winter of 1877-78, an astounding 188 shipwreck victim s and Surfm en died within a 30 m ile stretch of northern beach, including victim s on the USS Huron, which foundered off Nags Head in late Novem ber near a lifesaving station that had not yet opened for the season. This tragedy com pelled Congress to authorize eleven m ore stations; by 1879 Creeds 18 Hill near Frisco, Durants in Hatteras, Big Kinnakeet south of Avon, and Gull Shoal south of Salvo were in operation. By 1883, the New Inlet (Pea Island), Cape Hatteras, Ocracoke (Hatteras Inlet) and Ocracoke Villages stations were working. A seventh m an was added to each crew, and the season was extended from Septem ber to April. The num ber of deaths due to shipwrecks declined, and the status of the Lifesaving Station Keepers grew. The presence of the Lifesaving Stations, which becam e the U.S. Coast Guard stations in 1915, was socially, culturally and econom ically significant in the everyday lives of the Bankers. In addition to rescue m issions, the Lifesaving St ations provided governm ent jobs for islanders, infusing the Banks with steady incom e. The Lifesaving/Coast Guard system rotated Banker families to far-flung places as well as providing local em ploym ent. The stations served as \"safe houses\" for islanders traveling up and down the beach; the servicem en could be counted on to provide food, water, and som etimes transportation. The Stations also assisted Bankers with emergency com munications and m edical assistance. The Service form ed an integral part of local politics, as m en vied f or the coveted position of \"Surf man.\" To be a m ember of the service was to enjoy a certain status above those without steady paychecks, such as the typical \"Jack of All Trades\" Banker who fished, m arket hunted, guided s portsm en and/or did carpentry. Such status was expressed not so m uch in term s of m aterial wealth, but in term s of local influence and a certain worldly air gained from off-island tour s of duty. Lighthouse keepers at Ocracoke and Buxton enjoyed sim ilar status, as well as the m en who served on Lightships. Post offices were established around the turn of the century, form alizing a new nam e for many villages and im proving com munications. In addition to the pre-Civil W ar postal f acilities at Ocracoke (1840) and Hatteras Village (1858) Rodanthe (1874), Buxton (1882), Avon (1883), Frisco (1889), Salvo (1901), and W aves (1939). Mail boat routes 19 were lengthened and im proved upon to accom modate the needs of Bankers villages; the Ocracoke route started in Morehead City, Ca rteret County, and the Hatteras Island route cam e from Manteo. Freight boat routes to Ocracoke cam e from Little W ashington, Belhaven, or New Bern, and the Hatteras Island freight was run from Washington or Elizabeth City and Edenton. Dozens of sm all fam ily-run stores were established, as were \"tourist hom es\" or hotels to accom modate salesm en, visitors, and sportsm en. The Outer Banks was considered prim e waterfowl territory by 1900, and sportsm en traveled from New York, Baltim ore, and Philadelphia to take advantage of the rafts of waterfowl that wintered over in Pam lico Sound, and islanders carved decoys out of shipwreck debris and discarded lifesaving station telephone poles (W echter 1975). New public schools were built throughout the region as well. These schools incurred an increased dem and for teachers. Turn of the century innovations were close to hom e for Outer Bankers, including the Wright Brother's first flight at Kill Devil Hills in 1903, and Thom as Edison's staff m ember Reginald Fessenden's successful transm of a wireless m essage from Buxton to Roanoke Island in 1901 (Stick 1958,180). General Billy Mitchell proved the effectiveness of aerial bombing by sinking two obsolete battleships off Diam ond Shoals in 1923 (ibid, 295-96). The Coast Guard stations were the first to get wired for telephone service, and stores and fish houses were the first to get electricity (early 1930s) in the form of gas-powered Delco Light Plant generators. Autom obiles appeared in the 1920s, long before paved roads, and sail skiffs began losing out to \"gas boats\" with the influence, m oney, and dem ands of wealthy Yankee sportsm en in the late 1910s and early 1920s. Pre-W orld W ar II occupations besides governm ent jobs, storekeepers, and freight boat operators included com mercial fisherm en, eel grass harvesters, 20 teachers, preachers, carpenters, cannery worker s, hunting guides, and housekeepers at hotels and lodges; m any residents were em ployed in a com bination of such jobs. Som e islanders who had left the region in search of work during the econom ically stagnant 1920s returned during the Depression, knowing that they could eke out a living on the water. The \"cattle tick wars\" of 1921-26, requiring all free-ranging livestock to be dipped in a toxic solution, added a bit of excitem ent to the Banks as folks rounded up unruly herds and ran them through \"dipping vats\" every two weeks or so. This gave way to st ate legislation passed in 1935 outlawing free range stock - unpenned anim als were shot for a bounty of five dollars per head (Stick 1958). Ocracoke resisted such restrictions, but eventually succum bed before the laying of the highway. Harbor and canal dredging projects both assi sted Bankers and dim inished the im portance of Ocracoke and Hatteras Inlets: the of harbors in Ocracoke (1931), Hatteras (1936), Rodanthe (1936-37), and Avon (1946) was beneficial to fisherm en; but the decision to build the Intracoastal W aterway \"from Beaufort Inlet to Chesapeake Bay killed all hopes of again m aking Ocracoke Inlet or Hatteras Inlet m ajor ports of entry\" (Stick 1958, 183). \"A Coastal Park for North Carolina\" was the headline of the Elizabeth City Independent on July 21, 1933 advocating the rehabilitation and preservation of the Outer Banks environm ent. Rehabilitation plans gained m omentum after a hurricane destroyed roads and houses along the northern banks, and by 1934 the Civilian W orks Adm inistration com mitted funds for the project. Four non-resident owners, J.S. Phipps, J.H. Ph ipps, W inston Guest, and Bradley Martin, donated 999 acres surrounding the Cape Hatteras lighthouse for the proposed park. The state General Assem bly prohibited stock from grazing freely on the banks, which aided in grass planting and dune building. The National Park Service joined in restoration efforts, and recom mended the 21 establishm ent of the Cape Hatteras Seashore, which was passed by federal legislation in 1937 (Stick 1958, 183). All restoration efforts cam e to a halt in 1941, as W orld W ar II m ade dune stabilization seem trivial. Travel and tourism were curtailed, and Bankers by the hundreds enlisted in the armed forces. Villagers who did not serve overseas spent tim e scanning the coast and closing their curtains for fear of providing illum ination to Nazi U-Boats so successful at picking off U.S. warships; m ore than 60 boats were sunk off the Banks. During W orld W ar II, oil com panies began buying up m ineral rights off the Outer Banks. By the war' s end, islanders who had initially supported the establishm ent of a National Park during the Depression because of the potential for increased em ploym ent opportunities favored instead bringing in the oil industry. Oil com panies, however, soon m oved on after exploration efforts were not productive. Bankers enjoye d a post-war tourism boom , and property owners tended to m aintain their opposition to the Park. But, in 1952 two foundations in association with Andrew Mellon donated over $500,000 toward buying parkland; the state m atched these funds, and the National Seashore project was back on track (Stick 1958, 250-253). Hard feelings followed what som e called the \"land grab\" by the U.S. governm ent. Many questioned the m anagem ent policies of the Park Service, including Buxton resident Bill Dillon, who com plained in a 1973 interview that the National Park Service (NPS) was \"bent on letting the ocean com e over and do whatever it feels like doing...we are truly locked in a battle for survival with the Park Service\" (Dillon 1973, 8). Islanders were especially peeved when problem s with erosion led the Park Service to propose beach driving restrictions in 1978. Rather, m any villagers felt that the erosion could be better stopped with jetties, the building of a new inlet, or artificial reefs m ade from scrapped m erchant vessels (Glonek and Quidley 1978). 22 Another volatile issue concerned a 1974 National Park Service proposal to ban com mercial fishing on weekends along the elbow of the Cape during the m onths of January, February, and March. Spearheaded by sport fishing interests in New Jersey, the proposal was lam basted by islanders as running contrary to the Park's agreem ent to guarantee fisherm en a right to earn a living in the seashore area (Gray 1974). The developm ent of a paved road linking the villages of Hatteras Island preceded the establishm ent of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore in 1953. The road was built in sections starting with Hatteras to Avon in 1948, Avon to Rodanthe in 1950, and Rodanthe to the Oregon Inlet Ferry in 1952. This road was a significant catalyst for change. For exam ple, its developm ent led to the 1955 consolidation of sm all village schools into the Cape Hatteras School in Buxton. W hen the Oregon Inlet Bridge was com pleted in 1963, Hatteras Island was fully connected to the wider world, and this ushered in an era of tourism and developm ent. The pre- highway m odes of transportation - walking, sailing, horseback, beach cart - that had so long shaped islander's sense of space and tim e, and gave rise to phrases such as \"bank of the beach,\" and \"the old 101\" (101 sand tracks that always moved and changed), gave way to a single asphalt route that changed everything. Gone were the freight boats, m ail boats, fish boats and, in a sense, the art of boat building: There's still a considerable num ber of boat builders who could build boats, even shad boats, if there were a dem and, but the days of sm all boats, particularly sailing craft, are past. Mass-produced, f actory-built boats are now cheaper. Trucks and hard-surf aced roads have facilitated transport and ruined boat-building (Dunbar 1956, 125). Roads and bridges also ushered in a new degree of land prospecting, investing, and tourism . Although greatly convenient to Bankers who could drive to Manteo in less than an hour instead of a day, the road also quickened the pace of daily life, bringing about a \"trem endous cultural revolution\" and the \"passing of old folkways...\"(Dunbar 1956, 129). 23 Ironically, in a seaside area, the property m ost highly prized is that which was of least value prior to the advent of tourists - the beach itself. This sandy waste, the portion of the Banks m ost vulnerable to storm dam age, has the two features, sand and sea water, which constitute the prim e attraction of the area to tourists....The acquisition by the National Park Service of all the Banks from Whalebone Junction south to Ocracoke Inlet prevents the repetition there of the pattern established in the Nags-Head-Kitty Hawk area (Dunbar 1956, 129-30). 24 6.0. The Outer Banks Today (2004) Vehicles sporting white oval OBX (Outer Banks) bum per stickers are visible throughout the eastern seaboard, underscoring the popularity of Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands as a tourist destination. The predom inance of opulent vacation hom es and fancy shops and restaurants m ake it possible for visitors to rem ain unaware that long-term , traditional com munities exist on the Banks. Indeed, m uch of the interaction between natives and tourists occurs in the context of the services natives provide for tourists as carpenters, house cleaners, waiters, realtors, and other such tourist-based positions. This chapter describes m odern-day Outer Banks, and includes a discussion of the m ajor issues Banker com munities face in today's fast-paced, tourist-oriented econom y. This chapter concludes with a set of m anagem ent observations and recom mendations pertaining to the relationship between Cape Hatteras National Seashore (CAHA) personnel and neighboring villagers. 6.1. Regional Overview 6.1.1. Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands: Ecology and Geology Hatteras Island is a narrow 33 m ile-long sand bank south of Nags Head's Bodie Island; its width ranges f rom three m iles to less than one m ile. Hatteras Island represents the largest stretch of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. The northern portion of Hatteras Island includes the eight-m ile long Pea Island National W ildlife Refuge, a m ajor stopover for m igratory birds along the Atlantic flyway. Pea Island has, in the past, been separate from Hatteras with the opening of New Inlet; the last closing was in 1945 (Payne 1985). W imble Shoals off the northern villages of Rodanthe, W aves, and Salvo are the rem nants of Cape Kenrick, which jutted into the Atlantic until becom ing subm erged m id-17th century (ibid). The m uch larger and m ore treacherous Diam ond Shoals off Cape Hatteras are com prised of three shoals: the Hatteras, the 25 inner, and the outer shoals. The warm Gulf Str eam meets the cold Labrador current off of Cape Hatteras creating a \"weather-m aking\" chem istry that, along with the shoals them selves, has contributed to hundreds of shipwrecks throughout history. Ocracoke Island, just south of Hatteras and north of Portsm outh Island, stretches over 18 miles in length and ranges from 100 yards to two m iles in width. Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands were connected in the past, but have been separate banks since the Hatteras Inlet opened in 1846. The Hatteras Inlet was created by the sam e hurricane that opened the Oregon Inlet (Payne 1985). Although Ocracoke Island has no m ajor shoals off its Atlantic shores, it has had its share of shipwrecks due to the close proxim ity of Diam ond Shoals about 20 m iles to the northeast. Ocracoke Inlet, on the southwest end of the island, was the m ost im portant gateway to North Carolina during the 18th and early 19th centuries; it is the only inlet along the northern banks that has been continuously open since 1585 (Payne 1985). The barrier island ecology of Hatteras and Ocracoke is rich, diverse and extrem ely dynam ic. Although the width of the islands is as sm all as a half m ile across in som e areas, there are distinct environm ental features associated with the estuary, m aritim e forest and the ocean beach zones. The interior boundaries of Hatteras and Ocracoke islands face Pam lico Sound and are characterized by saltm arsh, tidal creeks, and lagoons. The shallow waters contain expansive beds of SAVs (subm erged aquatic vegetation), intertidal sand and m ud flats and shell bottom ; they function as a refuge and nursery for benthic larvae, juvenile fish and hard clam s. Crabs, minnows and shellfish m ake use of the intertidal and subtidal estuarine waters for spawning. The estuarine shoreline also provides habitat for a large variety of waterfowl, as well rodents, terrapin, and otter. Maritim e forests found along Ocracoke and Hatteras Island are characterized by a variety 26 of trees and shrubs (e.g., live oak, red cedar, pines, wax m yrtle and yaupon bushes) that appear sculpted or stunted by their close proxim ity to saltwater spray and high winds. The trees provide a windbreak and form a buffer between the estuary shoreline and the ocean shoreline, although in the past forest drifting sand dunes have swa llowed forested area. The forests provide an important habitat and refuge for num erous species of year 'round and m igratory birds, as well as mammals such as deer, raccoon, rabbit, and fox. Springer's Point, an area of m arsh and trees on Ocracoke, represents one of the northernm ost edges of southern m aritim e forest. Buxton W oods is the largest m aritim e forest ecosystem along the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, and contains both northern and southern vegetation as well as fresh water m arsh. The barrier island beaches function as shock absorbers for the powerful Atlantic Ocean, and are characterized by m iles of straight, unint errupted shoreline, dry sand area between the high tide m ark and the dunes, and a slightly higher, ever-shifting dune zone. Nearshore Atlantic ocean waters provide habitat and feeding grounds for im portant m igratory finfish and m arine mammal species, including m enhaden, striped bass, Atlantic croaker, dolphins and whales. The sub-tidal zone is replete with a variety of worm s, coquinas, and sand fleas that provide food for shorebirds. The dry beach area functions as an im portant nesting ground for four species of sea turtle, m ost com monly for loggerheads. The beach supports ghost crabs, beach fleas, a variety of amphipods and insects and num erous species of bi rds. Sand dunes deflect salt spray and provide some resistance to wind and wave erosion as well as ocean overwash. Dunes harbor a rich variety of wildlif e, including birds, reptiles, possum s, shrews and m ice. Dune plant lif e is adapted to salt spray, wind and shifting sand, and includes sea oats, panic grass, cord grass, golden rod, cactus and pennywort. Natural dunes along Hatteras and Ocracoke are characterized as low and discontinuous with overwash passes; the high, continuous dunes today are the result 27 of sand fencing, bull dozing, and dune/grass planting (North Carolina Departm ent of Environm ent and Natural Resources 2005). 6.1.2. Villages Since the paved highway and bridge was built in the late 1950s and early 1960s, connecting the banks to the world via autom obile and truck traf fic, village lif e has changed considerably com pared to earlier decades. Tourism and real estate sales began escalating in the 1970s and have shown no sign of abating. W hen Hatteras villages went \"on-line\" with the county water departm ent, using new reverse os mosis plants in Buxton and Rodanthe in 1997, high density building was possible; this factor is viewed as an im portant \"tipping point\" for many islanders expressing concern over the level of developm ent in their com munities. The seven villages of Hatteras Island are still unincorporated, and are part of Dare County. Census figures indicate that Dare County had a perm anent population of 29,967 in 2000, about 4,000 of whom lived on Hatteras Island (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002). The seasonal population for the county is estim ated to swell to 200,000 in 2000 (ibid,14). Ocracoke Island has one village, which is uni ncorporated and part of Hyde County. In 2000 about 770 perm anent residents lived on Ocracoke, with the estim ated seasonal population peaking at ten tim es that num ber. Hyde County projects that the seasonal population will grow to 8,500 by 2007 (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, III-57). All villages have been bordered by federally owned land since the 1953 establishm ent of Cape Hatteras National Seashore. The villages today bear little resem blance to the pre-highway and bridge com munities described in the ethnohistorical sections of this docum ent. All the villages of Hatteras and Ocracoke are growing in both seasonal and perm anent population, and are experiencing an unprecedented rate of construction and developm ent, despite recent hurricanes. Ocracoke's 28 29growth in new shops and rental homes, however, is limited by a sheer lack of acreage suitable for development; Ocracoke is also the only village wit hout an ocean shoreline. The flow of tourists slowed somewhat in the several months following Hurricane Isabel in 20 02, but has been rapidly increasing. The volume of people visiting Cape Hatteras National Seashore has more than doubled in the past decade, growing from 2.1 million in 1990 to 2.9 million in 2000 (Nolan 2001). The percentage of islanders dependent on commercial fishing is declining, and the current boom in real estate values have contribu ted to a reduction in wo rking waterfront areas and fish houses. Several factors have changed th e character of commercial fishing in the last decade, including strict federal, regional, and state fishing restrictions, a new state licensing structure limiting the number of commercial fishermen, and shrinki ng profits due to low market prices from a growing flood of imported seafood. Other factors affecting the fishing industry include social conflicts with re creational interest gr oups, a growing privatization of waterfront areas, and soaring prop erty taxes. 6.1.3. Demographic History of Hatteras and Ocracoke Villages Census data is available for the township s of Kinnakeet (including Avon, Salvo, Waves, and Rodanthe), Hatteras (Hatteras village, Fris co, and Buxton), and Ocracoke (Table 6.1.1). The steady increase in population for the Hatt eras Township through 1940, even during the depression years when the other townships experienced declines, is largely due to increased commerce upon the opening of the inlet in 1846. Ocracoke experienced a small but steady decline in population from 1920 to 1970, but ultima tely escaped the fate of the now extinct village of Portsmouth due to the highway and th e Oregon Inlet Bridge th at bolstered the small village's tourism industry. Kinnakeet Townsh ip shows a fluctuating population from 1900 to 1950, and a low of 434 people in 1960. This was likely due to a periodic need for northern island residents to leave in seek of work; this region lacks easy access to an inlet, and therefore has not had as large a com mercial or charter boat industry as Hatteras village. All areas show a marked increase in perm anent residents from 1970 to 1980, although Ocracoke's gains have been relatively m odest due to lim ited residential developm ent space. 673 368 1880 631 821 400 1890 793 906 466 1900 842 987 548 1910 525 1,217 475 1970 565 1,333 541 1,359 United States Bureau 2000. 6.2. Chicamacomico (Rodanthe, Waves, and Salvo) 6.2.1. Population Census f igures f or the specif ic villages are not available, but the Outer Banks Cham ber of Com merce reported that, in 2002, 567 people lived in the tri-village area of Salvo, W aves and Rodanthe, also historically known as \"Chicam acom ico.\" Villagers recall approxim ately 15 houses per com munity existing before W orld W ar II; each was separated by som e two m iles of 30 empty beach, in stark contrast today's continuous strip of buildings. According to the Dare County Land Use Plan, Salvo had 482 living units (m ost of which were detached hom es), compared to Rodanthe's 335 units and W aves' 241 units (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002). It is unclear how m any of the total 1,058 hom es were for perm anent versus seasonal residents, but the building trend favors rental structures. Since 2002, all three villages have experienced a tremendous building boom , particularly after Hurricane Isabel in 2003. This increase in housing will likely translate into m ore seasonal residents rather than perm anent, as m ost new houses are eight-bedroom \"rental m achines;\" other buildings consist of new shops and strip m alls geared to upscale visitors and tourists. 6.2.2. Land Use Salvo is the southernm ost village in the \"netherlands\" of north Hatteras Island, bordered by a long stretch of Park seashore to the south and the village of W aves to the north. According to the Dare County Land Use plan, \"Salvo will continue to develop in the established patterns with a m ix of perm anent hom es and businesses along NC 12 and seasonal residents along the immediate ocean and estuarine shorelines\" (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002,12). Most commercial developm ent in Salvo is geared toward \"providing services to the seasonal population\" (ibid). Salvo villagers joined with Rodanthe and W aves residents in March of 2002 to discuss the possibility of further zoning and deriving a consensus plan, as each village is unincorporated and unzoned, and classified as \"S-1 \" which covers setbacks, heights, and density but allows all uses of the land (Nolan 2002, 10). The developm ent potential of each village in 1997 was increased when com ing on-line with the reverse-osm osis water plant built in Rodanthe. 31 Waves is sandwiched between Salvo to the south and Rodanthe to the north. The close proxim ity of the villages m akes it dif ficult to discern com munity borders, but locals explain that Salvo runs from Wimbles Shores Road on the north end to south of Clark's Bethel United Methodist Church. W aves is characterized by \"predom inantly detached residential structures\" and several trailer parks and cam pgrounds (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002, 12); and, given soaring property values, trailer parks and cam pgrounds have a questionable future in this area. No Outer Banks com munity has fought harder against zoning restrictions than Rodanthe, the last village before entering the Pea Island National W ildlife Refuge. The Dare County Land Use Plan calls Rodanthe one of the \"the last fr ontiers in unincorporated Dare County in term s of the residents continued resistance to land use controls\" (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002, 12). There is, however, concern directed toward \"unpopul ar or incom patible uses and/or structures\" in the village (ibid). The lack of subdivision regulations for houses built decades ago has left the village with \"a m ultitude of private roads in poor condition\" (ibid). This, along with the periodic disrepair and flooding of NC 12, m akes transportation a prim ary issue for villagers. According to the Dare County Land Use Plan, Rodanthe is sim ilar to other unincorporated areas of the county in lacking \"any defined pattern of developm ent\" and is m ade up of residential lots and structures of \"various sizes and ages\" (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002, 12). A 1.0 MGD reverse osm osis potable water plant was built in Rodanthe in 1997, serving the village and sister villages W aves and Salvo. This has all but elim inated the need for private wells and the problem of saltwater intrusion, ocean over wash, and septic seepage that threatened to contam inate well-drawn drinking water (D are County Land Use Plan 2002, 12). The well water is safe but of poor quality for drinking, and residents who form erly bought bottled water rather than ingest the well water are satisfied with the quality of RO water for drinking. 32 Solid waste is transported daily to Bertie County from the Chicam acom ico Volunteer Fire Departm ent, a waste station serving all three com munities. All villages along Hatteras and Ocracoke m ake use of individual septic tank system s; the newer \"rental m achine\" houses are built with individual \"package\" sewage treatm ent system s, allowing f or a greater density of developm ent. 6.2.3. Government All three villages are now served by a U.S. post office in Rodanthe, although in the past each had its own facility. Salvo has its own vol unteer fire departm ent, while Rodanthe and Waves share the Chicam acom ico Volunteer Fire Departm ent; all three villages have access to EMT rescue squad services based at the Chicam acom ico fire station. 6.2.4. Employment In the past, when Coast Guard stations were operating every seven m iles along Hatteras Island, U.S. Coast Guard jobs were of central im portance to the northern banks, and the Midgett name was synonym ous with life saving. Today, in 2004, m any Salvo, W aves and Rodanthe residents seek em ploym ent at nearby Nags Head and Manteo. Additionally, they find employm ent locally in tourism , real estate or construction, and a handful of residents still fish commercially in Pam lico Sound or out of Oregon or Hatteras Inlet. W ithout a doubt, construction and service jobs associated with tourism and developm ent are Chicam acom ico's \"growth\" industries. 6.2.5. Churches Two churches are active in Salvo: the Salvo Assem bly of God and Clark's Bethel United Methodist. Clark's Bethel United Methodist Church is the last rem nant of Salvo's form er nam e 33 \"Clarks.\" On the border of Rodanthe and W aves is the Fair Haven United Methodist Church, which has been the prim ary church f or these two villages since the late 19th century. 6.2.6. Civic Organiz ations Villagers in Salvo, Rodanthe and W aves are proud of their history, and som e are active in the Chicam acom ico Historical Association while others volunteer their tim e at the Chicam acom ico Life Saving Service Station site and m useum . Som e of the native residents complain, however, that outsider influence has taken over the life saving station m useum , while museum volunteers com plain that natives are disinclined to participate. Recent changes at the Chicam acom ico station, including a newly im plem ented adm ission fee and structure modifications that com promise the historic integrity of the f acility, have exacerbated these concerns. Chicam acom ico residents m ake use of the Rodanthe W aves Salvo (RW S) Com munity Center in Rodanthe. The RW S Com munity Center is located in the refurbished old Rodanthe School by the harbor, and is used for a variety of events including the \"Old Christm as\" celebration for which Rodanthe is fam ous. Ol d Christm as is not organized by a form al group, but by m embers of a handful of old Rodanthe families long involved in the tradition. Old Christm as is one of the few rem aining rituals celebrating Chicam acom ico culture, yet it is not embraced across the board; som e native and non-native fam ilies of the northern banks are wary of the event's reputation for drinking and brawli ng, although this aspect has been toned down in the last decade. 34 6.3. Avon 6.3.1. Population The perm anent population of Avon stood at 792 in 2002, according to the Outer Banks Cham ber of Com merce. Of the 1,400 living units listed in the 2000 Dare County land use plan, 49 were condom inium s, illustrating the extent to which Avon is experiencing developm ent m ore than m ost of the Outer Banks com munities (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002). Other indicators of growth include a new shopping center, pharm acy, movie theater, traffic light and a Food Lion grocery store. 6.3.2. Land Use Within Avon's boundaries are two distinct sections. There is the old village of Kinnakeet, com prised of year-round residents who have strong genealogical ties to the village, and a residential developm ent and business district centered along NC 12 designed to serve the seasonal population. There is som e overlap, as Hatteras Island's only chain grocery store on NC 12 serves both seasonal and perm anent residents, as well as the new m edical center. The old village of Kinnakeet is one of the region's last holdouts for a working waterfront and com mercial fishing activity. The com munity is com prised of single-fam ily hom es, trailers, and a fish house (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002). Hatteras Island's very first beach lot developm ent, called \"Hatteras Colony,\" was begun in Avon in the 1960s, and a sm all canal-side developm ent within the village, called Port Avon, was built in the 1970s. On-site septic tanks and drainfield system s serve m ost residents of Avon, but the developm ent known as Kinnakeet Shores Soundside Subdivision uses a central package 35 treatm ent plant. This plant not only serves residential hom es of the subdivision, but also the associated com mercial com plex called Hatteras Island Plaza (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002). Although developm ent in Avon and other island villages has what the Dare County Land Use Plan calls the \"natural growth inhibitor\" of poorly drained soils and no central sewage treatm ent system , business is boom ing. New construction is evident in all villages, but according to the Outer Banks Cham ber of Com merce, Avon is one of the fastest developing Hatteras Island com munities. The year 2001-2002 saw a particularly heavy am ount of building despite a national recession. This was likely due to low interest rates and a trem endous influx of wealthy northerners who see a bargain in Hatteras Island real estate prices. Hurricane Isabel did little to discourage developm ent after devastating the island in 2003 and, in fact, another building boom began as older, dam aged hom es and hotels were replaced by larger tourist-oriented facilities. 6.3.3. Government Avon has its own post office. In the early 1990s there was a push to return the nam e of the post office to Kinnakeet. The vote was very close, but the nam e Avon won out by a handful of votes. For the m ost part, villagers opposed the change because they wanted to keep the nam e \"Kinnakeet\" to them selves and said that the greater com munity was not Kinnakeet. The Avon Volunteer Fire Departm ent serves the greater Avon area. 6.3.4. Employment Similar to other Outer Banks villagers, Avon residents find em ploym ent in the three m ain sectors: governm ent, tourism , or com mercial fishing. Unlike the other villages, there seem s to be a disproportionate num ber of folks from Avon who work for the ferry division. The reason 36 for this is historical and political, as Avon is a largely Republican village with strong ties to key political figures. Particular fam ilies have held ferry jobs throughout the years, and have an advantage in obtaining such em ploym ent (Glazier et . al 1993). There are also m any jobs in the construction business, and the m any real estate offices in Avon offer jobs in sales and rentals. Real estate is a huge business in Avon, as the section outside of old Kinnakeet has been the island's \"hot spot\" for investors and new rent al housing. Retail shops, surf shops, hotels, and restaurants also benefit from a healthy tourist i ndustry. Just south of Avon is \"Canadian Hole,\" a popular sound-side site for wind surfing and kite boarding. The nam e is derived from the large portion of Canadians that travel to the site. Avon has a strong history of boat building and com mercial fishing, and although the level of dependency on the fishing industry is declining, it is still im portant to the village. There is one rem aining seafood dealer in Avon, with a branch facility in Hatteras village; he and one other fish house owner are the last com mercial fishery dealers on the island. The Avon seafood dealer is also a com mercial fisherm an, and served on the state m arine fisheries com mission before resigning in 2004. 6.3.5. Churches The village of old Kinnakeet has a United Methodist and Assem bly of God church, both of which have played a central role in com munity lif e and in the history of the village. A relatively new Baptist church is located in a shopping center on Highway 12. 6.3.6. Civic Organiz ations The Avon Property Owners Association is th e only Avon-specific organization. It has 1,500 m embers (all property owners are autom atically m embers) and 500 who pay dues and 37 therefore have a voting m embership. But the m ajority of m embers are non-natives, and m any of those are non-resident property owners. The group m eets at Easter and Thanksgiving when many out-of-towners are present, and undertakes activities such as petitioning the state for maintenance of sub-division roads when the pre-requisite num ber of houses has been built. They have also placed garbage cans near walkways to the beach and keep up the wooden walkways to discourage tourists from tram pling the dunes. They also offer a scholarship to Cape Hatteras school seniors, with a preference for Avon students. 6.4. Cape Hatteras (Buxton and Frisco) 6.4.1. Population According to the Outer Banks Cham ber of Com merce, Buxton had around 1,163 full- time residents in 2002 (Personal Com munication 2003), m aking it the largest com munity on the Outer Banks. The centrality of the village, both geographically and in term s of com munity services such as education, explains the village's size. Buxton is growing in population like all other Outer Banks com munities, and is experiencing an influx of Hispanic residents. Although Buxton is m ade up of m ainly perm anent residents, it is a m agnet for seasonal visitors, as it is home to the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse. The recent relocation of the Lighthouse brought Buxton international attention, as well as an especially heavy tourist flow. The village has its share of vacation rentals on the beach and sound side. There are lots of retirees in Buxton, and shady subdivisions tucked into Buxton W oods. U.S. Coast Guard housing in Buxton has provided a steady influx of new residents to Buxton, but the de-com missioning of the residential section of the base in 2005 has halted that trend. 38 Frisco, a satellite village just south of Buxton, had 845 perm anent residents in 2002 (Personal Com munication, Outer Banks Cham ber of Com merce 2003), m aking it a m id-sized community com pared to surrounding villages. Frisco is clearly growing along with other banker villages, particularly in developm ent of rental hom es that cater to seasonal visitors. A growing number of retirees m ake their hom e in older sub-divisions of Frisco, such as Brigand's Bay and Indiantown Shores. On the other hand, elderly residents are inclined to m ove off-island to be closer to m edical f acilities. 6.4.2. Education All children who attend public school on Hatteras Island go to Buxton's Cape Hatteras School. All the separate village schools closed and becam e consolidated into Cape Hatteras School after the highway linked the com munities in the 1950s, to the objections of m any islanders. Cape Hatteras was a K-12 facility until 1997, when it split into Cape Hatteras Elem entary School (K-5) and Cape Hatteras Secondary School (6-12). This year a new prim ary school facility was com pleted in the Buxton W oods area of the village, representing the first tim e in decades that secondary school students and elem entary school students m eet at different sites. The schools had total enrollm ent of about 360 students in 2002 according to the Outer Banks Cham ber of Com merce. A new elem entary school is in the process of being built in Buxton Woods. The school building is a m eeting place for a variety of non-school events, including concerts, religious m eetings, and English as a Second Language classes. There is also hom e schooling on the island. Many hom e schooling parents are also very active in their churches. For college or technical training islanders m ust travel of f-island unless participating in \"distance learning\" Internet courses. The closest institutions of higher learning are The College of the Albem arle, Elizabeth City State Univer sity, and East Carolina University, although som e 39 students opt to attend school out-of-state in the nearby Ham pton Roads, Virginia. The College of the Albem arle is a com munity college with a satellite cam pus in Manteo. 6.4.3. Land Use Buxton is the m idpoint of Hatteras Island and serves as the \"com mercial and institutional hub\" for all the island com munities (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002, 13). The population is mostly perm anent, and although the com munity is developing with single-fam ily hom es and modest residential developm ents, growth is controlled by special zoning regulations aim ed at protecting the large m aritim e forest known as Buxton W oods (ibid). The effectiveness of this zoning is som etimes in question, however, as evidenced by the recent rem oval of a trem endous oak tree and disruption of surrounding historical graves by a new property owner in a county- controlled area. Frisco is at the south end of the thick cape area that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean, and sits on the m argin of Buxton W oods. The ecology of the area is noticeably denser with trees and vegetation than southern portions of the island, although Hurricane Em ily in 1993 wiped out many pine and live oak trees that once lined the highway through Frisco. As with Buxton, m aritim e forest influences developm ent in Frisco. Areas within Buxton Woods are zoned as SED-1, while property outside the m aritim e forest area is subject to S-1 minimal zoning regulations. The S-1 district l acks use-specific guidelines, and has resulted in commercial developm ent along NC 12. An effort to adopt m ore restrictive zoning in 1998 was unsuccessful \"due to the lack of com munity consensus of desired land use patterns along the vacant road frontage of NC 12\" (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002, 13). Som e Frisco residents 40 pushed hard for zoning in response to a proposed go-cart park, but m eetings were contentious and residents never reached an agreem ent; the go-cart park was built and operates today (ibid). The Billy Mitchell Airstrip, located next to Frisco on National Park Service land, is the only airstrip on Hatteras Island. The Park Service m aintains the 3,000-foot airstrip. NC 12 is the only highway, and Frisco - like all other villages, save Hatteras and Ocracoke - has no direct ocean-inlet access. 6.4.4. Utilities The Cape Hatteras Electric Mem bership Cooperative, based in Buxton, provides energy for residents and facilities on Hatteras Island. Throughout the 1980s islanders experienced outages and brownouts during the sum mer months because the plant could not keep up with demand. Electrical appliances would blow out, a nd custom ers lost m icrowaves, televisions, and refrigerators all in one shot. The com pany recently undertook a vast upgrade of the system to solve that problem . The Dare County W ater Departm ent serves Buxton, as well as Hatteras Village, Avon, and Frisco. W ater use fluctuates greatly, depending on the season. W ater use in July is roughly twice the am ount used in February (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002). A com bination of Reverse Osm osis and Anion Exchange water system s service the southern half of the island, drawing water from 19 shallow wells situated in the Buxton W oods superficial aquifer. The RO plant draws from brackish wells in the Mid-Yorktown aquifer (ibid). 41 6.4.5. Government Although Manteo is the official county seat of Dare, Buxton is Hatteras Island's inform al county seat, as the village houses satellite county offices and personnel such as social services, the health departm ent, building inspection, and (m uch to the disgust of Hatteras Village who form erly housed this) the sheriff's office. Buxt on furtherm ore houses federal governm ent offices such as the Cape Hatteras National Seashore District Ranger and m aintenance offices for the National Park Service. The Coast Guard Group Cape Hatteras offices are housed in Buxton, including adm inistration, electronics, engineeri ng, housing, m edical, and supply. Buxton also is the site of the Coast Guard's Search and Rescue base. The U.S. Departm ent of Interior has an office in Buxton. Until eight years ago the National W eather Service also had a facility in Buxton. The Hatteras Island Rescue Squad has a station in Buxton, as does the Buxton Volunteer Fire Departm ent. Frisco has its own fire district and station. 6.4.6. Employmen t Because of the location of Cape Hatteras Li ghthouse and associated offices, m useum , gift shop, and grounds, there are num erous National Park Service jobs filled in Buxton. The Coast Guard Group Cape Hatteras offers another m ajor source of em ploym ent, although recent downsizing and the de-com missioning of the residential base has shrunk this source. Cape Hatteras School is a m ajor em ployer on the island. Som e villagers fish com mercially or work as charter boat captains. There are num erous restaurants, m otels and shops in the village offering seasonal em ploym ent. A sm all public harbor is in Buxton, as is the island's only boatyard for repairs, painting, and so on. Villagers in Frisco work in the com mercial fishing, tourism , or governm ent sectors, 42 similar to other Outer Bankers. Frisco is also hom e to the only boat building f acility on Hatteras Island, \"Frisco Boat W orks,\" which m 32 to 65-foot cold-m olded sport fishing boats. Frisco has the only golf course on Hatteras Island (nine holes), and harbors a Native Am erican m useum that hosts a regional inter-tribal Pow W ow. Frisco also has a couple of North Carolina craft stores, a wooden furniture store, Frisco Rod & Gun, the Frisco Superm arket, and a post office. 6.4.7. Churches Buxton has m ore churches than any other Hatteras Island com munity. The \"United Methodist\" and \"Assem bly of God\" churches are the oldest places of worship in the village. \"Our Lady of the Seas\" is the only Catholic church on the island, and caters largely to newcom ers and Latino laborers. \"Cape Hatteras Baptist Church\" non-denom inational Island Chris tian Church\" and \"Church of Christ\" also offer services in Buxton. The two churches in Fris co are the \"Assem bly of God\" and the \"Little Grove United Methodist Church.\" 6.4.8. Civic Organiz ations The Fessenden Center, a m ulti-use recreational facility, was constructed by Dare County in the m id-1990s. It serves as a gym for sporting events and a m eeting place for other community gatherings. It of fers activities f or seniors, and exercise classes f or wom en. Its sm all meeting room s are used by a variety of non-profit groups. The Hatteras Business Association is based in Buxton and prom otes tourism and busine ss ventures. The Cape Hatteras Angler's Club, organized since at least the 1960s, has a m eeting house in Buxton. The organizers were sm all business owners who thought fishing tour naments would help increase tourism . 43 \"Friends of Hatteras\" was very active in Buxton, although it has petered-out som ewhat in recent years. The purpose of this organization was originally to preserve Buxton W oods from haphazard residential developm ent. Their m ain issue concerned the wells in Buxton W oods. Buxton's water used to com e from the Cape Hatteras W ater Association (serving Hatteras through Avon) until Dare County took over when the reverse osm osis plant was built. Friends of Hatteras had been against the expansion of wells in the woods. Publicly they m aintained that they were not against developm ent, but m any residents thought they were. Their stance against wells back-fired in a sense, because the reverse osm osis plant increased the available water supply and allowed for m ore developm ent (Buxton had been under a m oratorium on new hook- ups to the W ater Association for m any years because of there was not enough water). The North Carolina Fisheries Association Hatteras-Ocracoke Auxiliary operates out of Buxton, and is a satellite organization to the largest com mercial fishing trade group in the state. Largely organized and led by wives of com mercial f isherm en, the auxiliary seeks to preserve and prom ote the fishing industry in the area by holding fundraisers, writing letters to legislators, and testifying at fisheries hearings. 6.5. Hatteras Village 6.5.1. Population According to the Outer Banks Cham ber of Com merce, the perm anent population of Hatteras Village was 634 people in 2002. The National Park Service estim ated that the seasonal population of Hatteras Township expanded from a perm anent population of 1,660 in 1990 to 4,010 during the sum mer of that year (Glazier et. al 1993), and today that figure is m uch higher. Hatteras Island is developing in the southernm ost section near the ferry term inal, where large 44 rental hom es are springing up to serve the burgeoning seasonal population. These hom es sleep up to 20 people and are called \"m ini-hotels\" or \"rental m achines,\" and have swim ming pools, hot tubs, and five to eight bedroom s. The big co ttages visible around the ferry docks rent from $2,500 to $6,000 a week in the prim e sum mer season. Construction began on two m ajor developm ents in the heart of the village shortly after Hurricane Isabel in 2003, and ground was broken in 2005 for a developm ent on and around the form er porpoise factory grounds. 6.5.2. Land Use Hatteras village is the southernm ost com munity of Hatteras Island and is the only village on Hatteras Island with an inlet close by. This inlet has shaped the m odern village, starting with the birth of the charter boat industry in the 1940s. The village is a m aritim e hub between Pamlico Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, and is an im portant anchorage for sailboats and yachts. Com mercial fisherm en from points north find it convenient to keep their vessel at fish houses and m arinas in Hatteras Village for ocean access. Hatteras village is surrounded by federally-owned National Seashore grounds, m uch of which was form er hunt-club property donated for the Park. The ferry term inal property is owned by the state, and adjoining U.S. Coast Guard property is federally owned. Com mercial developm ent is greatly in evidence, as the ferry landing is surrounded by new and under-construction m ulti-story, m ulti-fam ily beach hom es, as well as a trem endous sport fishing m arina com plex housing a yacht club, slips for private boats and charter boats, and restaurants and shops. This com mercial nexus is the result of the \"Hatteras Landing\" planned developm ent approved by the county in the 1990s (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002, 13). 45 Hatteras Landing also has the Holiday Inn Express, the only chain m otel besides the Com fort Inn in Buxton. The Landing was built to attract tourists, especially ferry travelers. Heading north of the ferry term inal and away from the new construction and m arinas, NC 12 winds through Hatteras village proper, m ade up of picturesque old hom es and town square type f acilities like the post of fice, library, stores, and a daycare center. Meandering roads, sm all cuts and creeks, and sm all bridges give Hatteras Village a contained quality sim ilar to Ocracoke. Hatteras village, as well as the six other com munities on the island, is classified by Dare County as a \"lim ited transition\" area, which is a category that provides for developm ent in areas that \"have som e services but are suitable f or lower densities...and are geographically rem ote from existing towns and m unicipalities\" (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002, 13). According to the Dare County Land Plan, Hatteras village has \"done well in retaining its coastal village character while accom modating growth directed to the seasonal population,\" despite the lack of zoning restrictions (ibid). On the other hand, a survey undertaken for the National Registry of Historical Places concluded that no historic dist rict could be established because of too m any post-1950s buildings and raised-up houses (Van Doslen 1999). 6.5.3. Government Hatteras village is the southernm ost point of Dare County. The com munity has a post office and volunteer fire departm ent. Physicians are available for routine and em ergency care at the regional m edical center in Hatteras. The m edical center in Hatteras is af filiated with the new medical center in Avon. Both are Health East Fam ily Care facilities, connected with Pitt Hospital and three doctors rotate shif ts at the centers. The center f ormerly transported traum a patients f rom Billy Mitchell airport in Frisco, but now has a helicopter pad to transport them to regional hospitals. 46 47 6.5.4. Employment Because of the close proximity of Hatteras Inlet, Hatteras villag e is a hub of marine- related activities with jobs availa ble to residents. These includ e the Hatteras-Ocracoke ferry, the Hatteras Coast Guard station, two fish houses, charte r boat facilities, marine supply stores, fuel docks, and high dollar marinas. The charter boat industry began in Hatteras village and continues to thrive. The village had more dama ge from Hurricane Isabel (2003) than any other Banks community; hotels, restaurants, and mari nas were demolished, and the new inlet cut the village off from the rest of the world from mid Se ptember to the first of December. By spring of 2005 businesses still had not fully recovered from the effects of the hurricane, as charters and hotel reservations were down. Construction continues to boom, however, as repairs carry on and new developments such as Slash Creek proceed. 6.5.5. Churches In Hatteras village there are two churches : The United Methodist Church, with a mix of native and seasonal membership, and the smaller a nd more local Assembly of God church in the old \"Sticky Bottom\" sec tion of the village. 6.5.6. Civic Organizations The Hatteras Village Civic Association (HVCA) is by far the most active civic organization on the island, serving as an organiza tion for members to meet to discuss important issues and relay those issues to the county (Glazier et. al 1993). The Association was instrumental in pushing for a maritime museum in Hatteras, an effort that was frustrated and abandoned in favor of the \"Graveyard of the Atlantic\" m useum . The HVCA owns the post office building, and the Graveyard of the Atlantic houses its tem porary offices on the second floor. They own the Hatteras Civic Center, a form er auto parts store. They also own the Hatteras Com munity Center, housing the only public library on the island and offering space to Employm ent Security personnel who com e there in the winter so people can file for unem ploym ent benefits. 6.6. Ocracoke Island 6.6.1. Ocracoke Village Population The village of Ocracoke was hom e to 769 perm anent residents in 2,000, over half of whom are non-native to the island (Nolan 2003). The seasonal population swells to 3,000 - 7,000 residents (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, III-7). No other CAHA com munity has a higher level of tourist inf lux relative to the sm all, conf ined nature of the village. Historically Ocracoke was a favored destination of r ecreational hunters and fisherm en, and tourist accom modations have been present on the island at least since the late 19th century. But, 20th century developm ents in infrastructure, including the 1950s establishm ent of the state ferry system and the construction of Highway 12 north to Hatteras Island and Nags Head, paved the way for an accelerated influx of visitors. Touted as a \"quaint fishing village surrounding the Silver Lake Harbor,\" by the Outer Banks Cham ber of Com merce, Ocracoke's charm is compromised by the top-heavy nature of its tourist econom y. Despite its popularity as a vacation destination, Ocracoke has not experienced a m ajor population boom . For the first part of the 20th century, the population gradually dropped, from 587 people in 1920 to 475 in 1960. From 1970 to 1990 the population increased by 32 percent, prim arily due to influxes of the 1970s. It has rem ained relatively stable in recent years, hovering 48 between 750 and 790 perm anent residents. The stability is largely due to a lack of new building sites, as som e 90 percent of Ocracoke Island is uninhabited federal property. Building code restrictions, such as the prohibition of high-rise condom inium s on the island, discourage dense living spaces. Another factor is the island's isolation and lack of am enities that discourage a boom ing retiree population, including hospital facilities, shopping m alls or local governm ent. Nonetheless, the population is expected to gradually rise, according to the Hyde County Land Use Plan (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, III-5). The plan also projects that the island will be built to capacity (all available building parcels developed) by around 2010 (ibid, III-10). In term s of dem ographics, Ocracoke's population is growing younger and m ore ethnically diverse. This is due to two trends: the influx of Latino residents, a group now representing over 2 percent of the population of Dare County, and the out-m igration of older residents. Ocracoke Child Care reports that an im pressive 17 percent of children enrolled are Latino, reflecting the fact that incom ing Hispanic fam ilies are young and working. Som e are seasonal, hired according to the H2B work visa program , and others stay year-round, picking up jobs in restaurants, construction, fish houses, hotels, and grounds m aintenance (Nunn 2002). Ocracoke has experienced a decline in its 55-64 population, which is in part due to rising property taxes, according to the Hyde County La nd Use Plan. \"Increasing property values are resulting in rapidly increasing tax values. This is having a...negative im pact on the ability of long-tim e Ocracoke residents to pay the taxes a nd retain property\" (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, III-64). Hyde County has increased property taxes several tim es since the 1970s. In 2002 Hyde's tax rate for Ocracoke was 0.95 per $100, com pared to Dare County's rate of 0.54, and an average of 0.76 for Hatteras Island com munities. Hyde County lowered the tax rate to 0.70 per $100 in 2003, but at the sam e time re-evaluated property values on the island. Alton Ballance's 49 modest island house, for exam ple, was valued at $179,511 in 2002, and he paid $1,705 in property tax. One year later his house was valued at $511,345, and his tax bill was for $3,579 (Nolan 2003). 6.6.2. Land Use Out of a total of 5,575 acres m aking up Ocracoke Island, only 775 acres com prise Ocracoke village on the southernm ost end of the island; the federal governm ent owns the remainder and is part of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. There are no zoning laws on Ocracoke Island, resulting in m ixed land uses such as interspersed residential and com mercial facilities, oddly positioned lots, houses and trailers, and chicken pens juxtaposed to gift shops. Although villagers expressed concerns about ha phazard and accelerating developm ent, a zoning referendum was defeated in 1981. The \"Ocracoke Village Developm ent Ordinance,\" however, was adopted by Hyde County in 1986 to: [P]rom ote the public health, safety and general welfare by regulating the density of population; the size of yards and other open spaces; the height, size and location of buildings and other structures; to provide for an adequate transportation system ; and to provide for adequate drainage, water suppl y, and sewage disposal (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, III-10). The ordinance restricts buildings to 35 feet or sm aller in height, and establishes setbacks and a minimum lot size. These provisions, according to the county land use plan, are not sufficient in controlling Ocracoke's developm ent. Between 1990 and 1997, 125 new houses were built on Ocracoke. Several new non-residential facilities have been constructed since 2000, including a hotel, a m ulti-store facility, and a replacem ent post office. The 1986 Land Use plan nam ed \"inconsistent land use patterns\" as the island's m ost signif icant land com patibility problem . This was changed to \"inf ringem ent of developm ent on 50 natural and fragile areas\" by 1997, as developm ent has proceeded without proper perm its, wetlands have been destroyed, storm water runoff and septic seepage has m ade Silver Lake unfit for swim ming, and m arina and boat discharge has contributed to degrading water quality (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, III-10). The Ocracoke Sanitary District provides water service, using two deep wells (each over 600 feet deep) that draw from the Castle Hayne aquifer and a desalination plant. The prim ary well produces 600 gallons per m inute, while the secondary well produces 400. The Sanitary District had less than 500 custom ers when service began in 1977. By 1997, they had close to one thousand m etered custom ers. During peak season, water use m ore than triples. Ocracoke has one 150,000-gallon elevated storage tank and a ground storage capacity of 232,000 gallons (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, III-13-15). Drinking water on the island is considered marginal in taste, and m any islanders buy bottled water (Personal Com munication 2004). There are no publicly owned sewage facilities on the island, with the exception of the North Carolina Departm ent of Transportation's ferry landing facilities. Although a handful of commercial facilities have advanced septic system s with low flow pum ping, m ost sewage is treated by conventional septic tanks. Like the water service, sewage treatm ent is overtaxed during the height of tourist season, and there is concern that septic tank seepage is contributing to declining water quality. Although islanders have discussed the possibility of a central sewage treatm ent system , the increase in population density that could result from such a system outweighs environm ental concerns associated with septic tanks (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, III-15-16). The 2,500 tons of trash generated annually on Ocracoke is a growing issue, as m any islanders feel the waste-rem oval system has been substandard and is overburdened during tourist 51 season. During warm months it is com mon for the \"downtown\" Silver Lake area to reek of garbage. As there is no solid waste landfill in Hyde County, Dare County is contracted to collect trash f rom Ocracoke and transport it across the Hatteras Island f erry to a landf ill som e 70 m iles away. Recently the National Park Service enacted a controversial policy of rem oving garbage cans from the beaches, in an effort to force visitors to rem ove their trash. Tideland Electric Mem bership Corporation s upplies electrical service to Hyde County, including Ocracoke, and power is purchased fr om North Cape Hatteras Electric Mem bership Cooperative. Electrical shortages, brownouts and blackouts were a problem on Ocracoke until 1990 when a larger supply cable was installed and a co-generating plant built. Power outages still occur occasionally, however, as salt spray shorts insulators on transm ission wires (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997). Many residents and businesses own generators in the event of hurricanes or other causes of power loss. A larger supply cable under Hatteras Inlet and other im provem ents to the service were com pleted in the late 1980s, which reduced brownouts and blackout problem s on the island. A cogeneration plant was built on the island in Novem ber 1990 and is licensed to operate at 200 hours per year. It norm ally functions two to three hours per day during peak dem and periods, although when the Bonner Bridge collapsed shortly after the plant was com pleted, severing power lines to the island, the plant operated as the sole power source until the lines could be repaired (Glazier et. al 1993). Ocracoke is located within the 100-year flood plain area, and is routinely subjected to storm water flooding. The Hyde County Land Use Pl an nam es \"hurricane destruction\" as the single greatest hazard to developm ent in the village (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, III-33). 52 Villagers have expressed great concern over the developm ent occurring on the island and, until the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust recently bought it, feared that a historically significant and ecologically delicate area known as \"Springer's Point\" would be sold and built upon. Local historians believe that Springer Point was the location of Pilot Town, the Island's first English settlem ent. 6.6.3. Government In 1845 Ocracoke's county assignm ent was m oved from Carteret to Hyde, located across from Pam lico Sound on the m ainland. Today, in 2004, Hyde is largely agricultural and isolated, and if not for Ocracoke, Hyde would be one of North Carolina's m ost econom ically depressed counties. Ocracoke village has no m ayor, sheriff, or other such form al county office, but has one seat on the Hyde County com mission and school board. Unlike the prosperous Dare County, Hyde County is decidedly rural (the county has no m unicipalities), sparsely populated (it has the lowest population density in North Carolina), and low-incom e. Relations with Hyde County are lukewarm at best, as island villagers com plain about the sm all am ount of county services they receive relative to the high am ount of taxes they pay to the econom ically depressed county. As a recent exam ple, villagers point to Hyde County's poor execution of em ergency m anagem ent procedures during hurricane Alex of 2004 when, due to m iscom munications, the island's tourists were not evacuated until after the storm and flood. Som e villagers resent being \"held hostage\" as Hyde County's \"cash cow,\" and would prefer to be under the jurisdiction of Dare. An ongoing debate questions whether Ocracoke should incorporate, giving the village m ore control of land-use issues. But, \"no clear consensus on the issue exists\" (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, III-19). After the 2003 property revaluation of Ocracoke, the 750 residents carried alm ost 53 54 percent of Hyde County's tax burden, while only m aking up 13.2 percent of the county's population (Nolan 2003). Other governm ental entities that m ost directly im pact the lives of Ocracokers include regulatory bodies for fisheries: the state Divi sion of Marine Fisheries, the regional South Atlantic and Mid Atlantic Councils, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Com mission, and the National Marine Fisheries Service. Ocracoke fish ermen feel that they have inadequate input in regulatory decisions, both due to their geographic isolation and the nature of how the fisheries managem ent system works. W ith the exception of a few residents who faithfully attend meetings and participate on advisory boards, m ost fisherm en are of the opinion that it is a waste of tim e to travel to m eetings only to be disregarded by policy m akers. The National Park Service is a daily presence in the lives of Ocracokers, as National Park Service em ployees m anage the Ocracoke lighthouse, pony pen, cam pgrounds, and seashore, some 90 percent of the island's land m ass. The island's water supply com es from wells on Park property, and the National Park Service sold land to the county for the airstrip and jail. The National Park Service allowed the Ocracoke Preservation Society to operate a m useum on governm ent property. The National Park Service also has provided services such as pum p out facilities at the public docks, and fire departm ent and law enforcem ent assistance (Glazier et. al 1993). The Hyde County Sheriff's Departm ent sends three deputies to Ocracoke, on a rotating basis, who patrol the island and m aintain an office and two four-m an cells. Police activity heightens during the peak season, particularly w ith regard to traffic violations and drunk and disorderly behavior (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, Glazier et. al 1993). 54 The county keeps four full-tim e em ergency m edical technicians (EMTs) on the island, and one \"m odern fully-equipped\" am bulance (Hyde County Land Use Plan, III-18). Patients are typically transported to the Ocracoke Health Center f or initial treatm ent, then if necessary to the hospital in Elizabeth City (Glazier et. al 1993). Two private m edical helicopter services, based in Greenville, North Carolina and Norfolk, Virginia, serve the island. A physician's assistant and a registered nurse staff the health center. To see a doctor, dentist, undertaker, social worker, or mental health specialist, however, residents m ust seek services off-island. The nearest hospitals are in Elizabeth City (a four-hour driv e) and Morehead City (a three and one half hour drive); one prim e factor discouraging retirees from spending their twilight years on Ocracoke. The Ocracoke Volunteer Fire Departm ent is com prised approxim ately 25 active well-trained m a m utual aid agreem ent, the departm ent keeps a trailer- mounted pum p with a 250 gallon per m inute pum ping capacity which is owned by the National Park Service\" (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, III-18). Their equipm ent is adequate for one- and two-story structures, but is not capable of m anaging fires in anything higher. Most calls are for brush fires in the National Seashore area in the sum mer (Glazier et. al 1993). 6.6.4. Employment Ocracoke, like other Outer Banks com munities, continues its historical reliance on tourism , governm ent jobs, and com mercial fishing. In 1980, about a third of the residents were employed by the Coast Guard, the Ferry Service, the National Park Service, or the school. In recent decades, tourism has overshadowed all other sectors of em ploym ent and is responsible for the highest level of econom ic return for the island. Secondary em ploym ent is vital to residents, especially during off-season winter m onths. A ccording to the Hyde County Land Use Plan, m ost 55 full-tim e non-retired residents have two or m ore sources of incom e. These jobs include commercial fishing, net m ending, construction, and crafts associated with cottage businesses (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, III-50). Only a handful of people are full-tim e com mercial fisherm en (mainly crabbing and gillnetting); m ost fishers supplem ent their incom e with other jobs. One fish house owner provides a local m arket for fisherm en, but it is not uncom mon for waterm en to sell fish directly to local restaurants. Unlike fisherm en in the deepwater port towns of W anchese or Beaufort, Ocracoke fisherm en do not have the option of working on large, ocean-going vessels, but work small boats (20- to 40-feet long) in near shore waters of Diam ond Shoals or in Pam lico Sound (Glazier et. al 1993). Ocracoke, like Hatteras Island, benefits from a lucrative m arine sport fishery. Native islanders f amiliar with the waters hire out their services to visiting anglers eager to take advantage of North Carolina's world-renowned saltw ater fishing. Ocracoke and Hatteras Village have several privately owned and operated charter boats (six passenger capacity) and larger \"head\" boats (30-100 passenger capacity). There are also a slew of tackle and bait shops associated with recreational fishing. Unlike R odanthe, Avon and Frisco, Ocracoke has no large fishing pier available to the public. Recreationa lly sought species include striped bass, red drum , kingfish, flounder, gray trout and m ackerel. There is no saltwater fishing license requirem ent in North Carolina, but the Division of Marine Fish eries collects data via phone and dock surveys, as well as National Marine Fisheries Service program s. 56 6.6.5. Churches The four churches on Ocracoke are the United Methodist Church, the Ocracoke Assem bly of God, the Christian Science Church Group (which m eets at various tim es) and the Annunciation Catholic Church (which m eets at the Methodist facility on Fridays). 6.6.6. Civic Organiz ations The Ocracoke Civic and Business Associa tion (OCBA) is an organization for local cottage businesses. As of 1997, m ore than 70 of the 100 Ocracoke businesses were m embers of the OCBA. The Ocracoke Preservation Society is the island's historical association, and is responsible for designating and m aintaining historic sites, and has interviewed and videotaped dozens of Ocracoke residents about their history. 6.6.7. Education The only educational f acility on the island is the K- 12th grade Ocracoke School, the smallest in North Carolina. The present six classroom , wood-fram e building was built in 1971, with additions constructed in 1978. In 1993, 99 students were enrolled in the 135 student- capacity school. In 1997 enrollm ent was down to 75 students, and today (2004) it stands at about 100; m uch of the growth can be attributed to the influx of Latino fam ilies. Basketball is the school's only sport. Ocracoke School has been recognized as a School of Distinction, a North Carolina School of Excellence, and a \"Top 25 School\" (Outer Banks Cham ber of Com merce 2001). The school enjoys considerable com munity support, and is at the center of much activity on the island as a variety of fund-raisers, m usical events, and variety shows take place in the gym . 57 6.7. Modern Issues Contem porary life on a barrier island retains som e of the sam e challenges of earlier decades, such as vulnerability to storm s, potential isolation in the event of road and bridge washouts and, at tim es, lim ited occupational choices. Yet, today's residents face new problem s as well, m ost of which are associated with the sheer num bers of people living on or visiting a shifting, fragile, sandbank. These contem porary problem s, discussed below, include: beach erosion and dune stabilization; transportation, impact of developm ent on environm ent and quality of life; im pact of developm ent and real estate values on com munity integrity; shortage of labor and affordable housing; erosion of tr aditional livelihoods and life-ways; and relations between residents and Cape Hatteras National Seashore staff; 6.7.1. Beach Erosion and Dune Stabiliz ation Historically villagers built their hom es on the sound side of the island and, in the event of a rising tide, would sim ply allow the water to wash through the house. If a structure floated off its foundation, villagers m oved it back, or to higher ground. Since the 1970s and, m ost intensely in the years leading up to and following Hurricane Isabel in 2003, opulent rental hom es with swim ming pools and hot tubs have been built on what has becom e the m ost valuable real estate on the Banks: the beach. The ocean shoreline outside National Seashore boundaries is packed with m ulti-level, high-dollar hom es vulnerable to storm winds, ocean waters, and beach erosion. The natural, westerly m igration of North Carolina's barrier islands threatens these structures, and \"(w)hen this process occurs along a developed shoreline it eventually collides with private 58 property or public infrastructure and com es to be described as 'beach erosion'\" (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002, 26). Environm ental organizations express concern about potentially negative im pacts of sand pumping on the intertidal and beach ecosystem , and coastal geologists point out the futility of such projects against the intense energy and m ovem ent of North Carolina's oceans and barrier islands. Village residents are largely opposed to using tax dollars to fund sand-pum ping, contending that the public should not foot the bill for beach hom eowners in their efforts to protect private property. This issue is ongoing for the entire coastline and no sim ple solution is in sight. 6.7.2. Transportation The issue of m aintaining NC 12, the only route through the Outer Banks other than by boat or sm all plane, is a continuous problem for Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands. Before the dunes were built up and paved roads established, erosion and over-wash was a frequent fact of life, and residents expected yesterday's sand path to disappear under tom orrow's tide. The hardened roads of today present a difficult problem in the event of storm dam age, as road repair is an expensive and tim e-consum ing necessity. Seven areas have been identified as likely washout areas in the Dare County Land Use Plan, including a section just north of Buxton that went out in 1999's Hurricane Dennis and a section north of Hatteras village that becam e an inlet after Isabel in 2003. A section of highway near the National Seashore cam pground on Ocracoke washed out in Isabel as well. Access to Hatteras Island and Ocracoke is of critical im portance because of the businesses that depend on delivery trucks and a flow of visitors. It is also a public safety issue in terms of hurricane evacuation. The only route off Hatteras Island becom es clogged, and 59 evacuees run into the Nags Head traffic heading north to Virginia. The increased num ber of cottages and visitors on the island has com pounded this problem . Locals are known to \"ride out\" the storm s, but m any have changed their m inds after witnessing the devastation of Isabel. Bonner (Oregon Inlet) Bridge has outlived its lifespan and is due to be replaced. A barge hit the bridge in 1990, knocking out a span and bringing island traffic to a standstill for six months. A ferry was set up to cross Oregon Inlet until the Bridge was repaired. The state built emergency ferry docks in Rodanthe for future em ergencies. State planners proposed a new, longer bri dge and causeway that would bypass Pea Island and com e in at Rodanthe in lieu of repairi ng the Bonner Bridge. Another option was a new bridge and causeway that would run along the sound, bypassing all villages except for exit ramps. This would address the problem of NC 12 washouts as well. The project has been delayed num erous tim es due to environm ental im pact studies and a lack of funds. Most recently the state decided to build a new bridge that would not bypass Pea Island, but this has yet to be funded. The North Carolina Departm ent of Transportation operates the ferry system , and Ocracoke islanders are com pletely dependent on this service for vehicular traffic and the flow of goods and services. The Hyde County Land Use Plan nam es transportation as one of the island's critical issues, particularly in regard to seasonal traffic congestion along Silver Lake road where the Cedar Island and Swan Quarter ferries load and unload. Paradoxically, the county also supports \"the establishm ent of a high speed ferry between Ocracoke and the m ainland\" which would increase the flow of visitors to the island (Hyde County Land Use Plan 1997, xxvi). Hyde County planners recom mend relocating the Swan Qu arter ferry to East Bluff Bay, which would shorten the two and one half hour trip from Ocracoke to the County Seat by 45 m inutes; this 60 change has yet to be im plem ented. Planners are also considering m aking a one-way road to and from the ferry to alleviate congestion. 6.7.3. Impact of Development on Environment and Quality of Life The Dare County Land Use Plan lists the following top three areas of concern for the future of its coastal com munities based on a series of public m eetings and a m ass-m ailed survey. The first pertains to water quality, sewage dis posal, and storm water m anagem ent. The second relates to water supply and sewage treatm ent. The third deals with econom ic diversification (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002). All these concerns are linked to the im pact of developm ent and tourism in barrier island com munities. The expansion of im pervious surface associated with new parking lots, roads, driveways, and roofs are directly related to storm water flooding and runoff that contains chem icals, septic tank overflow, and other pollutants detrim ental to shellfish, sea grass, and other f isheries habitat lif e. Villagers worry that a decline in f isheries will com pel everyone to depend on notoriously seasonal and low-paying tourist-related jobs. Many lam ent the clearing of trees, disruption of cem eteries, and altering of the native landscape in favor of gated-type com munities replete with non-native plants such as palm trees. For islanders, such activities sym bolize the uprooting of their culture in favor of an im ported lifestyle. Although some villages, such as Ocracoke and Hatteras, have started to address the problem by adopting a variety of building restrictions, there is little sign that construction is slowing. Com munity leaders throughout the banks are debating the m erits of m ore stringent zoning, town incorporation, and - in the case of Ocracoke - secession to a new county. A long-entrenched opposition to zoning from villagers and political opposition to new governm ental configurations are roadblocks that challenge such action. 61 6.7.4. Impact of Development and Real Estate Values on Community Integrity Although, in m any cases, islanders have profited from the burgeoning tourist and recreation industry-and could stand to m ake huge profits by selling land- this prosperity exacts a cultural cost. The quaint, neighborly character of these villages has been com promised by an increasing num ber of new houses, shops, and developm ents in the heart of town. Recently, a group of Hatteras villagers from the Civic Association appeared before the Dare County commission to object to a proposed 45-unit condom inium with 46 boat slips on the environm entally-sensitive Slash Creek. They presented ideas f or specif ic building restrictions previously aired before fellow villagers at a series of public m eetings. They asked for help in keeping \"the ever dim inishing quality of life in our sm all com munity\" (Nolan 2002, 10-11). The commissioners accepted their proposals, but were im mediately served with a lawsuit, brought forth by several Hatteras business owners. The issue split the com munity until Hurricane Isabel hit, putting developm ent on the back burner and com pelling villagers to work together. Af ter Isabel, state officials declared the Slash Creek area altered by the storm and eligible for required building perm its. In 2005, com mercial developm ent of Slash Creek, along with dozens of other areas in the Outer Banks, is underway, changing the appearance and character of sm all villages. Ernie Foster, son of the founder of the Albatross charter boat fleet, wrote an article entitled, \"Thoughts on W atching a Village Die.\" ...[by] intend to m ake a quick profit...chang[ing] forever the physical nature of the village and its social fabric. Once these structures are built, they will be there beyond our lifetim e...These are structures that will never be hom es (Foster 2002, 13). Com munities full of fisherm en, carpenters, and other blue collar workers long accustom ed to depending on one another are at odds with the private, sanitized lifestyle im ported with such affluence: 62 Hatteras is on its way to becom ing a place that no longer has a place for its com mercial fisherm en. Already, hom es are being built on what was once a place to m end nets, sell fish, and store crab pots. Now there are com plaints from the new owners about the sm ell of fishing. W hen you have a place where, if you actually work and m ake your living there you cannot afford to live there, then you have a strange place indeed (Foster 2002, 13). The Dare County Com missioners have responded to m any of the above concerns. Com missioners are considering countywide zoning, controls on building density and better wastewater treatm ent for Hatteras Island. They recently outlawed com mercial structures over 20,000 square feet in unincorporated areas, and set a m oratorium on new com mercial signs (Nolan 2002). In response to villagers' concern over the proliferation of \"m ini-hotels\" or six- eight bedroom rental houses, com missioners voted to tie the num ber of bedroom s allowed in a house to the size of the lot and the septic capacity. Individual villages have discussed the possibility of zoning as well, but run headlong into a strong reluctance by property owners who do not want to relinquish control of their land. Despite the concerns shown by county com missioners, there are few little signs that developm ent is abating. Proponents of controlled growth are not yet effectively organized, and continue to grapple with a problem that has overwhelm ed the island since the 1990s when builders, developers and outside m oney cam e pour ing in. Islanders express concern about m any of the changes that com e about as a result of developm ent, including the appearance of chain stores and restaurants, cable television, the push to sell liquor by the drink, other signs of m ass media culture, and an increasing drug abuse problem . High real estate values also have an im pact on village lif e as residents, som e of whom are struggling com mercial fisherm en or other such traditional users of the water, are com pelled to \"cash in\" and sell waterfront property and fam ily land. Those who choose not to sell and 63 continue to live on the island are faced with increased property taxes which have m ore or less tripled since 2002. A group of concerned Ocracokers proposed a tax relief bill in June of 2003 that would allow eligible townships (where revaluation was 150 percent higher \"than the average increase in all the other townships com bined\") to be taxed at 50 percent of appraised value, deferring the rem ainder until the property owner sells (Nolan 2003, 17). This bill was not supported by Hyde County com missioners and ultim ately failed. 6.7.5. Shortage of Labor and Affordable Housing As a growing num ber of affluent visitors and residents buy property on Hatteras, there is an increased need for laborers to serve those people (e.g., lawn care, house cleaning, restaurant work, seafood packing, retail sales, etc.). At the sam e time, there is increasingly less affordable housing available for blue-collar workers. Many of the low-rent trailer parks are being sold to developers, as the boom ing real estate values prove tem pting to landlords. Outer Banks communities have addressed their labor shortage by hiring f oreign workers f rom a variety of European countries and Latin Am erica. Many businesses provide apartm ents or trailers for their laborers, but local fam ilies worry that they and/or their children will no longer be able to afford to live and work on Hatteras or Ocracoke Islands. 6.7.6. Erosion of Traditional Livelihoods and Life-w ays Com mercial fishing has long been an integral part of the history of North Carolina coastal com munities, and the Outer Banks is no exception. Associated with com mercial fishing are a num ber of occupations that also share a place in the state's m aritim e econom y including: boat building, net m aking, crab pot m anufactur ing, charter boat fishing, seafood processing, 64 marketing, and shipping. W hile fisherm en have struggled with growing restrictions on their livelihood since the 1980s, m any had an especially difficult tim e when m arket prices becam e severely depressed for key fisheries in the early 2000s. Consequently, som e com mercial fishery participants have abandoned their occupation altogether. High fuel prices and lack of political support have exacerbated the problem . Up until the 1980s there were about a dozen fish houses on the Outer Banks. As of 2005, only one com pany operates out of Ocracoke, and two out of Hatteras. Fisherm en worry that shrinking profits will com pel the rem aining fish house owners to sell their property, elim inating the necessary infrastructure to carry on a viable seafood industry: working harbors, fish houses, and seafood trucking. Fishing is f ar more than an occupation f or island participants; it is a source of cultural identity that has, in m ost cases, been in the f amily for generations. Thus, the decline of the fishing industry and associated work m eans far m ore to villagers than a change in jobs. The growing popularity of \"heritage tourism \" and an effort to establish local, niche m arkets offers some hope to fisherm en, but they still m ust be able to afford to live on the islands and have a place to keep their vessels. 6.7.7. Relations betw een Residents and Cape Hatteras National Seashore Staff Since the Cape Hatteras National Seashore Park was established in 1953, relations between the National Park Service staff and Banks ' residents have ranged from indifferent to problem atic, if not hostile. The reasons f or this are m any and com plex, stem ming from the initial acquisition of property for park land, a process that som e islanders refer to as the \"land grab.\" Com pared to the exorbitant property values today, the price f amilies were paid f or waterfront land in the 1940s and 1950s strikes m odern villagers as a pittance, although som e 65 concede that open beach land once was regarded as having little value. Most com plaints that have followed the establishm ent of the Park pertain to people's belief that they have lost certain freedom s in their own Banks' environm ent under the rules and regulations im posed by the National Park Service. Related to this is the widespread com plaint that the National Park Service has done a substandard job of m aintaining public relations and com municating with local residents. However, the current rate of developm ent has indirectly cast a better light on the Park in villager's m inds, as m any appreciate that \"their\" land has been preserved and protected f rom outside investors and developers. Acknowle dging the am bivalence with which m any people regard the National Park Service and the outright hostility som e have toward Park policies, a villager declared, \"The Park Service saved us f rom ourselves.\" He continued: The Park Service is not great - their public relations is awful. It's like they show up with a club with a nail driven through it to try to soothe people's feelings. But hell, independent of that, where would we be? We could be Nags Head. I am fascinated by the foresight of various groups that had all these hunting clubs and large tracts of land. The Phipps fam ily owned all of Cape Point, the Gooseville Gun Club owned f rom the f erry dock down to the inlet, Pea Island wildlife refuge was owned by som e hunting club. These people gave their land to the governm ent. 6.8. Management Observations and Recommendations A survey undertaken for the 2002 Dare County Land Use Plan update asked if federal agencies such as the National Park Service facilitated the needs of county residents. 67.5 percent of the respondents, m any of whom were non-resident hom eowners, answered affirm atively. 22.6 percent, m ost of whom were full-tim e residents, disagreed that federal agencies served their needs. The negative reaction \"m ay be explained by the fact that full-tim e residents have day-to- day interaction, and som etimes conflicts, with federal agencies due to the dom inant federal presence in Dare County\" (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002, 7). 66 The relationship between the National Park Service and neighboring villages is often referred to as a \"shotgun m arriage,\" whereby Bankers have had little choice but to live within the confines of a bureaucratic agency. \"The Park Service has an agenda of the way things are supposed to be,\" said a resident. \"That's not a m arriage, and it can never be a m arriage.\" Many residents refer to wording in the Act establishing Cape Hatteras National Seashore that assures villagers that the Park will not interf ere with thei r ability to m ake a living f ishing: \"That the legal residents of villages referred to in section 1 of this Act shall have the right to earn a livelihood by fishing within the boundaries to be designated by the Secretary of the Interior, subject to such rules and regulations as the said Secretary m ay deem necessary in order to protect the area for recreational use as provided for in this Act\" (Na tional Park Service 1941, 2). Fishing restrictions imposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service or the state Division of Marine Fisheries are sometimes conf lated in villagers' m ind as stem ming from the National Park Service, while m ost realize that m any other agencies im pose regulations on their activities, but believe that those agencies should heed the original agreem ent of the governm ent. Islanders also refer to a \"prom ise\" contained in a letter to islanders from National Park Service director Conrad L. W irth published in the Coastland Tim es, October 27, 1952. W irth wrote that the \"National Park Service and its staff stand ready to cooperate with you at all tim es in the developm ent of your com munities, if you want us to. I hope we can work together as partners, and that we can look forward to a long and pleasant association...\" (Kozak 2002, 1). Wirth added that the National Park Service \"proposes to resum e the sand-fixation work; to re- establish the natural plant and wildlife within the area, and to provide access to the beach for everybody\" (ibid, 3-4). Bankers now regard these as broken prom ises: they do not believe they have been treated as partners but as recipients of policies; they do not believe the National Park 67 Service has successfully protected island dunes and beaches, especially after the governm ent adopted a \"let nature take its course\" approach in 1973 and abandoned dune restoration efforts (ibid); and finally, restrictions im posed on commercial fishing, recreational fishing, beach driving, and hunting is overly restricting beach access. Tom Hartm an, a well-respected Park superintendent who filled the position from 1981 to 1994, noted a deeply entrenched conflict between the \"com peting goals of resource protection and visitor use,\" and what villagers want and what \"Congress dictates the Park Service can do\" (Kozak 2002, 6). Hartm an pointed out that the intent expressed in W irth's letter ran against later legislation, such as \"the W ilderness Act of 1964, the Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the National Environm ental Policy Act of 1969 and the Endangered Species Act of 1972\" (ibid). Coupled with the fact that the Banks are a \"dynam ic resource\" that changes quickly according to natural forces and hum an m anipulation, \"Park m anagers found them selves m aster of an unruly subject\" (Kozak 2002, 6). Several observations were m ade by villagers in interviews f or this project or in articles in local newspapers concerning how relations m ay be im proved between the National Park Service and residents. Most centered on the issue of co mmunication, as relayed by an Ocracoke resident in the following quote: Why doesn't the Park Service engage in problem solving dialogues with the com munities located within the boundaries of the Park? Typically the National Park Service unveils a new program or policy - such as rounding up feral cats in the village or taking away trash cans - without discussion with the com munities that are affected. Officials announce that a public m eeting will be held to listen to the citizens. These m eetings are always set up in a m anner which stifles problem -solving and prom otes confrontation. W hat if two or three m embers of the National Park Service staff took the tim e to have a sit-down-at-the- table discussion with com munity leaders to f ind m utually satisf ying solutions to problem s? (Scarborough 2001, 10-11). 68 The \"m anner which stifles problem -solving,\" according to residents, is that m eetings seem organized as a m eans to inform locals about a new policy and why the policy is needed, rather than a m eans to collaborate with villagers to solve a problem . Som e villagers feel strongly that a policy is a \"done deal\" by the tim e it is presented to com munities, and resent what they perceive to be a \"one-way\" channel of com munication. They would prefer to have inform ation, as well as input, early in the process, before decisions are m ade; this would im prove communication, dialogue, and ultim ately, staff-Banker relations: [Take the restoration of the] W eather Bureau. Som ebody from the Park Service could f ind out when the Hatteras Civic Association m eeting is, and m ake a little presentation, an update. Offer to do it rather than be asked. Proactive rather than reactive. The Park Service is always in defensive bureaucratic m ode. They operate independently of the com munity. If you are the professional operating this m assive system that is im pinging on everyone who lives there, what does it cost to throw out olive branches? Most people will be swayed by the better argum ent. Residents generally believe that the National Park Service is not attuned to the culture of the Banks, and f eel the organization needs \"som eone whose job it is to be culturally sensitive. That would be a contribution, and when they have to fight these awful battles over beach access and all this m ess, they would have a little currency in the bank.\" The Park Service's efforts to uphold and enforce legislation such as the Endangered Species Act has given villagers the impression that plants and anim als are valued above people, and m any wonder why cultural resources are not given the sam e due as natural resources. For exam ple, a m an from Buxton participated in a National Park Service-sponsored effort to m anage a user-conflict between fisherm en and sailboarders. After serving on a com mittee organized by the service, he expressed frustration regarding the National Park Service's role in educating the public about local communities and traditional uses of the environm ent: Sailboarders were cutting our nets. They didn't m ean to do it, but they'd approach our net and instead of jumping it, they'd veer of f and tilt their board so the f ins 69 would hit the top of the net and cut it. The Park Service f ormed this little com mittee and I was on it. I told them since they explained the history of the area to the tourists they should also educate them about our nets. They said, we can't m ake public speeches like that. I said, why can't you? You tell them about shore birds, the lighthouse, turtles. If you can't educate them about us, why, there's no use of m e being on this com mittee. The fisherm an conceded that the idea of m aking allowances for native residents is a slippery slope, as m ore outsiders are m oving to the island perm anently, bringing new perspectives, values, and pressures to bear. \"They can't have a special rule for m e and a different rule for som ebody else just because they're from New Jersey.\" Based on these observations, we offer the following recom mendations: \u0089 Adopt a collaborative m odel of problem with com munity m embers for issues that pertain to them .

Rodanthe 7.1.1. Relation to Other Villages and Beyond The 1850 census reported that Chicam acom ico Banks, including Rodanthe, W aves, and Salvo, had a total of 206 people and 3 7 families (Wechter 19 75). The co mmunities p erched on this nor therly margin of Hatter as Island were distinct settlem ents, with Rodanthe to the north, Salvo to the south, and Waves be tween the two - all separated by about two m iles with sm all creeks and little bridg es. Yet, they were nec essarily co-dependent, and gi ven the area's relative isola tion an d lim ited m arriag e choices, interrelated. Rodanthe and W aves, however, were particular ly close knit, w hile Salvo functioned m ore independently. Salvo was once called \"Clarks\" or \"Clarksv ille,\" while the two villages to its \"Chicam acom ico\" Rodanthe,\" continued close relationship. The two northernm ost settlem ents have long shared a church, Fair Haven Methodist, while Salvo housed its own Methodi st church as well as the only Assem bly of God church in Chicam acom ico. Roda nthe shared a post office with W aves until 1939, while Salvo has had its own since 1901. Although the Chicam acom ico Volunt eer F ire Departm ent originally served the tri-village area, disagreem ents between volunteers from Salvo and those from the northern two villages r esulted in the b reaking of f and estab lishment of the Salvo Volunteer F ire Departm ent. Rodanthe has historical ties to the m ainland fishing village of Wanchese through the commercial fishing trade and kin relations. Som e Wanchese residents attended Rodanthe's Old Christm as celebration, o ne of the few \"off-island\" communities to do so on a regular basis. Until the late 1950s, Brad Payne of W anchese was th e official \"dru m beater\" at Old Christm as, 72 keeping time with the coveted Payne fa mily pre-Revolutionary W ar drum along with a horn player and harm onica player from Rodanthe (Norfolk et al. 1951). Despite their reputation f or livi ng in an isolated comm unity, Rodanthe villagers are quite worldly, hav ing done m uch trav eling for work, m ilitary service, and schoo l before the Oregon Inlet Bridge was built. F amily m embers' s ervice in the Coast Guard cause d people to r elocate near and far, from Hatteras, Ocracoke, and Fort Macon to N orfolk, New York, and New Jersey. Many joined the Navy during W orld W ar II. An elderly villager recalled leaving Rodanthe during this period to live and wo rk in San Francisco after her husband shipped out to Japan. After the wa r, her husba nd joined th e Coast Guar d and the fam ily m oved every two y ears or so to Philad elphia, Connecticut, New Je rsey, Virg inia, Georgia, a nd Florida, until retir ing to Rodanthe an d opening th e Ocean Air motel. Many villagers have kin in Manteo, Eli zabeth City, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach, maintaining an im pressive network to and from Rodanthe. Older people som etimes opt to retire to an of f-island location s uch as Eliza beth City to be close to a hospital. T hose residing on the island m ake frequent trips to m ainland locations for doctor's appointm ents, shopping, or visiting. About half the attendees at Rodanthe's Old Ch ristm as celebration live off-island, retu rning each January for this ritualized hom ecom ing and fa mily reunion. Today, in 2004, Hatteras island ers and visitors traveling north through Rodanthe can easily m iss the village in a blur of to urist attr actions and rental hom es. But for m any decades throughout the 20th century Rodanthe was the northernm ost stop of the Manteo-Hatteras Bus Line bef ore crossing the inle t to Man teo; a ll sand roads com ing up from Hatte ras v illage to the mainland literally went through Rodanthe, th e home village of the bus line's founders. Therefore, the village w as quite familiar to re sidents of all seven co mmunities to the south. 73 7.1.2. Name, Place, and Features Rodanthe is the northernmost village on Hatte ras Island, and the easternmost point in the state of North Carolina. Although a sm all comm unity, it has served as the gravitational heavyweight of the tri-village com plex known as Chicam acom ico. Prior Rodanthe was known as \"North Chicam acom ico\" and its south was \"South Chicam acom ico.\" The U.S. Postal Service, un willing to us e the length y Indian na me, chose Rodanthe for reasons unknown. Rodanthe m ay be derived from the non-native flower Rodantha (DeBlieu 1998); som e old tim ers of Ocracoke Carteret C ounty pr onounce the word \"Road- Anthony,\" but evidence is lacking that the villag e was nam ed after a pers on. The village was called \"North Rodanthe\" as opposed to \"South R odanthe (now W aves) and \"Clarks\" (Salvo) in the early 20th centu ry, bu t becam e Rodanthe prop er upon the estab lishm ent of the W aves post office in 1939. Other pre-postal service nam es for the village include Big Kinnakeet, Chichinock-Com inock, Chicky, Midgett Town, and Northern Woods (Payne 1985); a villager born in th e early 1920s recalled hearing the term \"North'ard Woods \" for Rodanthe an d \"South'ard Woods\" for Waves. Although the Chi camacom ico area is no longer heavily wooded, storm s have uncovered large stum ps along th e beach, thus confirm ing early to m id-19th centu ry accounts of deep woods once char acterizing the region and maki ng sense of the \"North'ard appellation (DeBlieu 1998). m iles offshore the tr eacherous W imble Shoals, \"re mnants of Cape Kenrick,\" a m ajor cape of Hatteras Island th at ex isted b efore the f ormation of Cape Hatteras, but disappeared in \"the m iddle part of the seventeenth century\" (D eBlieu 1998, 49). This shallow, shifting shoal is one of the hotspots that ea rned North Caro lina's waters the nicknam Atlantic.\" Rodanthe sits on an \"unusually th in\" layer of sand and peat above 74 Pleisto cene rock, and th erefore experiences a hig her rate of erosion than Hatter as Island locations to the south (DeBlieu 1998, 19). New Inlet, 5.6 m iles north of Rodanthe, ha s been closed since 1945. However, it has been open at various tim es and served to divide Hatteras Island from Pea Island, m aking Rodanthe the northernmost jum ping-off point for Bankers to Manteo. The state attem pted to re-open New Inlet in 1922 to \"sti mulate the fishing industry on the Outer Banks,\" but failed (Payne 1985, 133). The 1933 storm opened the inlet, and the Stat e of North Carolina built a wooden bridge to Pea Island, the rem nants of which can be seen to day, in 2004 . Even after the inle t clos ed for the las t time, joining Pe a and Hatte ras Islands, Ro danthe was s till the northernm ost inhabited area for travelers crossi ng Oregon Inlet to Nags Head and Manteo, although islanders som etimes stopped at the Pea Is land or Oregon Inlet Coast Guard Station to rest or eat a m eal with the Surfm en (Figure 7.1.1 ). The Chickinacomm ock Inlet, just 1.5 m iles north of Rodanthe, was opened in the 1650s but closed before 1775 (Payne 1985, 133). 75 Figure 7.1.1. Old Oregon In let Coast Guard Station. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. In 1936, the Coast Guard dug a channel and T- shaped harbor on the sound side of Rodanthe in Blackm ar Gut, giving the village the distinction of ha ving the only m an-made refuge for boats in the C hicam acom ico region (Figure 7.1.2). The Harbor was dug to serve the Chicam acom ico Coast Guard Station and \"only inci dentally to serve the local residents\" (Dunbar 1956, 115). It is the only Banks harbor not dug by the Arm y Corps of Engineers (ibid). The channel leading up to the harbor was dug seve n feet deep, but by 1945 \"it had shoaled to 4.5 feet\" (ibid). 76 Figure 7.1.2. Satellite Im age of Rodanthe. Source: NC Division of Marine Fisheries. The harbor is located at the old Rodanthe school site, wher e the m ail boat used to unload its cargo. T he harbor/school area was long the center of the C hicam acom ico community, particularly when active fish hous es were located there and buyers bid on fish (Map 7.1). The Departm ent of Transportation bu ilt an emergency f erry land ing at the Ro danthe ha rbor after the Bonner Bridge was damaged and te mporarily closed in 1990. 77 Map 7.1. Rodanthe Village with Hi storical Sites (not to scale). Sketch by B. Garrity-Blake. 78 Today, in 2004, Rodanthe has all but disappe ared under the trappings of tourism and developm ent. There is little visible evidence of a village - many of the old houses are hidden in brush or dw arfed by the overwhelm ing presence of rental m ansions and shopping plazas (Figure 7.1.3). Between Rodanthe and th e neighboring village of Waves there w as once a wetland area called Aunt Phoebe's Marsh (P ayne 1985); this area is now a them e park of sorts with a waterslide, go-cart track, and cam psites. Th e community of Rodanthe, however, becom es manifest each January, w hen nativ es travel far an d wide to participate in th eir Old Christm as celeb ration; an antido te to tourism , change, and cultural homogenization. Figure 7.1.3. Abandoned House in R odanthe. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake Photo. 7.1.3. School Chicam acom ico experienced the first consolid ation of schools on Hatt eras Island, as both the W aves and Salvo schools were closed in the 1930s and children of all three villages began 79 attending school in Rodanthe. Th e three-room schoolhouse ran through 11th grade u ntil 1947 -48 when it becam e accredited as a 12-year high scho ol. Before the school w as accredited, students intending to graduate had to leav e the village and board els ewhere to complete their la st year. Some attend ed the schoo l at Hatter as village, stay ing with loca l families or at the Atlantic View Hotel, while others lef t for Manteo and Elizabeth City. Islanders have fond m emories of the old Rodanthe School, in cluding drinking from a rain barrel with a shared conch shell, stoking the w oodstove on cold m ornings, and studying with a small class of peers who rem ained lifelong frie nds. W hen the Rodanthe School closed around 1953, Chicam acom ico, Hatteras village, and Frisco students were bused to the old Cape Hatteras school in Buxton. W hen the new Cape Hattera s school building was co mpleted in 1955, all Hatteras Island students - includi ng those from the illage of Kinnakeet, were bused to Buxton. Consolidatio n was probably m ost shocking to the distan t communities of Chicam acom ico given their strong school prid e and long-standing vill age rivalries. 7.1.4. Church Clark's Bethel Episcopal South (in S alvo) and the Fair Haven United Methodist Church (located on the border between Rodanthe and W aves and established in 1886), have long served the two communities. \" That was an other way we were sepa rated [from Salvo] ,\" said an octogenarian. \"They had their church and we ha d ours.\" Fair Haven was originally located on the sound side, but was rebuilt in th e center of the island on th e ocean si de of the road after damage from flooding. \"Everybody went to ch urch,\" recalled Anderson Midgett. \"D ad or Mother never really m ade us go to church but th ey m ade it so that if you didn't go to church you didn't go nowhere else.\" Both Methodist congregations in Chi camacom ico lost som e members 80 when the Pentacostalist Assem bly of God church was established in Salvo in 1927. Today, in 2004, the preacher at Fair Haven is shared by the Methodi st church in Salvo and Avon; she m inisters to the th ree congregations, one after the ot her, each Sunday. Before the convenience of better roads and tr ansportation, the Met hodist preacher w ould alternate Sundays between the three villages, and during \"off\" weeks churches held lay-led services. Church brou ght villagers H atteras Islan ders attended each other's hom ecomings and other big events, because of shared kin and an appreciation for social events. This practice is continued today. \"W hen we have hom ecom ing, Pe ntecostal or Methodis t, everyone's invited, everyone's glad to see you,\" said a villager, adding that \"you see a lot of people at the post office too.\" A Hatteras villager reflected on the ro le of cam p meetings -or revivals- in bringing distance ends of the island together: One of the big socializing events would be re vivals. Cam p revivals in w hich people from Hatteras would load up equipm ent for the old traditional camp m eeting and go up the banks or down the banks and stay w ith that fam ily for four or five days. Part of it was the religious services at night but the big draw was th e chance to intera ct. Originally it wa s Methodist, one of the first religions, but then the P entecostals cam e. Many villag ers felt that relig ion play s a weak er role in today's community. A s maller percentage of comm unity members attend church regularly, and the church has become less a driving force behind social gatherings and a focal point in people's lives. \"Everyone used to go,\" remarked a resident. \"T hat was all they had back then. Now you've got civic clubs, genealogies (the Hatteras Island Genealogical and Historical Society ); all th at kind of stuff to compete.\" 7.1.5. Stores By the first part of the 20th century, several sm all general stores operated in the Rodanthe/Waves area, including those owned by Rowan Midgett, Sudie Payne, and Asa Gray. 81 Joyce Midgett Rucker described th e store that her father establis hed in 1936 to serve the Civilian Conservation Corps who had a base cam p in R odanthe during their dune-b uilding initiative. The store was run by Joyce Rucker's mo ther Ersie Midgett and staffed by fam ily m embers. It \"m ore or less opened when needed\" during \"most of da ylight hours or at night.\" It was the only place in the village, other than the Chicam acom ico Coast Guar d Station, with a telephone. The Midgetts carried dry goods, canned g oods, toiletries, and a weekly de livery of fresh meats, m ilk, and bread. They kept cold dri nks in an icebox, and offered ice cream once receiving electricity. Joyce Rucker helped h er mother tend the sto re, an d said that residents bou ght on credit, tallied in a book, and settled up at month's en d. The store ran until 1952. 7.1.6. Pastimes and Childhood Activities Visiting was an im portant after-church activ ity for villagers. Fa milies hos ted neighbo rs, relatives, an d Bankers from other co mmunities to Sunday dinner. \"After dinner,\" recalled an old-tim er, \"the kids all played on the beach. They had horses that run wild and cattle, so you might be out catching a horse to ri de or tailing the cattle. You w ould grab a hold of the tail and let him sling you up and down the beach.\" Children thr illed at the e xcitem ent of watc hing C oast Guard rescues and drills, and they sometimes got to ride in the breeches buoy. \"They shot what they called the Lyle [the gun to the grounded ship]. Shot a line over the boat and they would bring pe ople ashore on it. You'd ride what they call the breeches buoy.\" The friendly relations between Surfmen and village children illustrate the inform ality of Banker life, and th e fact that som e of the statio n personnel and children were likely related. Teenagers h ad wiener ro asts, fish fries at a fishing cam p, chicken st ew parties and candy- 82 pulls at various people's houses. Young people gather ed at general stores to play cards, Chinese checker s, or strum guitar s. Bef ore W orld W ar II, dating was d one in group s. Som e families lef t the is land f or trips once or twice a y ear, trave ling to department stores or am usement parks in cities such as Norfolk. A Rodanthe wom an reported that girls were expected to help with m ost of the household chores, while boys enjoyed m ore freedom . Anothe r said that her brothe rs were treated like kings, and were at the dinner table first to be se rved by their sisters. The girls h elped gather firewood, care for sm aller siblings, cook, and wash dishes, w hile the boys m ainly fished with their father. 7.1.7. Medical Care There were f ew doctors accessible to Rodant he during the first pa rt of the twentieth century, and none based in the Chicam acom ico region. A doctor in Hatteras village or Buxton would m ake house calls to the no rthern villages, and for m ajor emergencies the Coast Guard or Navy flew people off to m ainland hospitals. Before paved roads and bridges, wom en relied on m idwives for childbirth, such as Orenda Mid gett, M ary W illiam Beck Midge tt, and Sudie Payne of Rodanthe. Af ter World W ar II more expectant m others opted for physician-a ttended and/or off-island hospital births. An elderly woman born in R odanthe explained that she was one of nine children, all born at hom e with a m idwife. But, she sought the services of doctors for her own children, born after W orld War II, and did not choose to deliver them at hom e. Families tre ated eve ryday medical pr oblem s with hom e remedies pass ed down f or genera tions. A village r recalled tha t her m other treated colds with \"cas tor oil and o range, and 83 that was terrible but it did work!\" She and her br others, like all island chil dren, went barefoot in the summ ertim e, and if they stepped on a rusty na il their m other would \"dra w\" the in fection with fat back bacon and turpentine by laying it over the wound. Another person recalled drinking Coca Cola with five drops of a mmonia for \"nerves.\" 7.1.8. Early Transportation Before automobiles, islanders traveled by f oot, horseback, or sailing vessel. Many had small pony carts to transport the whole fam ily. They sailed sm all skiffs up and down Hatteras Island, and poled in nearby sound waters in \"shov e\" skiffs. Bankers could ride the m ail boat or catch a freight boat to Elizabeth City. Cars appeared at Chicam acom ico in the 1920s; when a private car ferry opened at Ore gon Inlet, villagers drove to th e end Pea Island and caught the ferry to Bodie Island and on to Manteo. W ith th e closing of New Inlet between Hatteras and Pea Island, Rodanthe fisherm en were at a disadvantage in living a good distance from an inlet, and had to sail to Oregon Inlet to clam and som etimes to fish. 7.1.8.1. The Manteo-Hatteras Bus Line T. Stockton Midgett, a C oast Guard surfm an w ho raised his fam ily in a Rodanthe house fashioned from timbers of a wrecked ship, star ted the is land' s first \"pub lic transpo rtation\" system . Midgett, who had starte d the general store in 1936 to serve CCC personnel, had a keen eye for business potential. He found him self ne eding a ride from the Ocracoke Coast Guard Station, and pondered the need for improved tran sportation. In 1938 Midgett began the Manteo- Hatter as Bus Line tha t ran from Hatteras Village to Manteo. But he died of a heart attack two months later, leaving 18-year-old Harold, 14-year-old Anderson, a nd 10-year-old Stockton 84 \"Stocky\" Midgett to carry on the business with the Ford station wagon their father had purchased; islanders were glad to have transporta tion other than sailboat, and used the bus line in such num bers that the brothers soon switched to larger buses. The boys continued the Manteo- Hatteras Bus Line for the next 35 years. A Hatteras villager looked back at the bus line and m arveled: You had guys that were 15 or so and they we re running a bus service, and no one in the community thought that it was odd or strange or som ehow wr ong or they needed to be regulated - it was, \"Thank God som eone's running a bus!\" T hey were a couple of enterprising kids w ho could do the job. \"We used to bring just about everybody that left Ocracoke to go to Norfolk,\" said Anderson Midgett. \"They all traveled with us - Ocracoke, Hatteras, Buxton, Avon, Rodanthe, Waves, and Salvo, all of them . So we got to know just about everybody in the whole area.\" Until th e late 1940s, when paved po rtions of road were beginning to app ear on th e island, sand ruts an d hard beach formed the only routes , and a sm all wooden ferry transpo rted vehicles from the north end of the island en ro ute to M anteo. \"That was a privat e ferry run by Toby Tillet and Pam Gallop,\" recalled Midge tt. \"They were both W anchese fellows with a sm all ferry named the New Inlet and, later, a larg er ca lled the Barcelona .\" Sand paths changed with blowing sand and sw elling tide, thus alte rnately closing old \"roads\" and suggesting new ones. Thus, the m ost expedient route across the island was always in flux and dependent on the variables of tide, wi nd, and weather conditions. \"W e used to call our route the 101 - hundred and one roads because there was no designated ro ad. If th e tide was out, you drove the surf. If the tide was in, you dr ove the bank of the beach or a dozen inside roads.\" They drove across shallo w inlets cut by storm s, or avoide d deepwater cuts by driving out into th e sou nd. They maneuvered the bus aroun d shipwreck s and across sandy beach es. They 85 routinely got stuck in the sand, requiring passengers to get out and push. Stocky Midgett recalled when he alm ost lost a bus: I was driv ing to Manteo one day after we ha d the highway. The ocean tid e was com ing across the road south of the old Coast Guar d station, and the bus m otor drowned out. I got out on the front bumper to dry the distributor, trying not to get m y feet wet. Meanwhile, the front wheels just fell through th e road. I hurried to get the people out and put them on a hill. I had to practically swim [to the Coast Guard Station] but I got there. We took the duck (an amphibious vehicle) back to where the bus used to be. W e couldn't find the bus. The bus was com pletely covered (Tolson 1983, 25). The Midgett brothers worked endless hours k eeping their buses m aintained, as sand and saltwater was rough on the vehicles . \"It wasn't unusual to break a spring a day,\" said Anderson Midgett. \"Work on them half the night to get th em ready for the next da y. W e starte d a little garage and kept them painted and washed down. We m ust have used, in 35 years, over a hundred buses.\" The Midgetts took out loans when in need of a new bus or m ajor repair, always repaying the bank prom ptly. \"W e'd wear them out com pletely until they rusted righ t out. Everyone said we were hard drivers but, you had to be to drive on the beach.\" Villagers paid around $2 .50 for a one-way trip from Hatteras to Manteo, and in the history of the service \"the fare never did go over $2.75.\" Their schedule began at Hatteras Inlet, where they m et the boat from Ocracoke around 8: 15 am . They would then travel north, stopping roughly on schedule at designated stores or post offices, beginning with their own garage/station in Hatte ras and continu ing to stops th at typ ically included the Frisco Post Office, Eph Midgett's store in Buxton, Gibb Gray's store in Avon, the Sa lvo Post Office, Asa Gray's store in W aves, and Ersie Midgett's store in Rodanthe. People \"k new to sit th eir su itcase out, and we'd stop and pick them up.\" The bus reached the ferry at Or egon Inlet four and a ha lf hours later, barring no major delays from storms, flooding, soft sand, or breakdowns. \"Som etimes it took us eight hours 86 and som etimes ten,\" said Midgett, adding that it wasn't unheard of for him and his custom ers to have spent the night on the beach. \"We'd cross the ferry with Captain T oby, go into Manteo, m ake connections with the Virginia Dare Transportation com pany bus...turn ri ght around and com e back to Hatteras. That was a daily schedule seven days a week, and we didn't m iss many days.\" The round-trip route took two tanks of gas. The Midgett brothers transported Coast Guar d personnel on liberty, st udents traveling to and from boarding school, and islanders in search of dredge, shipyard, and other jobs. \"I can think of m any that really didn't have the fare; when they com e back, they'd have the money and pay us for it. They'd ride with us for years and years.\" The bus line was especially busy during W orld Wa r II, as is landers lef t to enlis t or f ind work and more Coast G uardsm en and Navy pers onnel arrived. Despite rationing, the Midgetts were supplied with all the gas c oupons they needed. They experi enced the close proxim ity of the war first hand, as Ande rson Midgett described: One m orning as I rounded a litt le turn in the beach, I saw the most tires that you could ever se e. They had bombed the sh ip off our coast that was loa ded with m ilitary tru ck tires. You could not hardly drive. One da y we found a lifeboat th at was bullet-ridden, with two bodies in it. R eported it to the Chicam acom ico Coa st Guard station when I went by. We had to keep our lights blacked out and when you were dr iving at night, it slowed you up. You couldn't drive out on the surf so you had to drive the inside. The paving of Highway 12 in the late 1950s and the com pletion of the Oregon Inlet Bridge in 1963 m ade the Midgett 's route faster and easier, although there was the continued problem of overwash and \"cut-ou ts.\" The road also spelle d the end of the bus line business, however, as residents and visitors were able to provide their own transportation. But the brothers simply moved on to their next business venture, which would prove lucrative for them into old age, as well as their ch ildren and grandchildren: r eal estate. Midgett Realty now m anages \"a 87 substantial portion of land on Hatteras Island\" (D eBlieu 1998, 40). \"W e've been in real estate for right good w hile,\" reflected Anderson Midgett. \"But I still en joy driv ing the beach.\" 7.1.9. Postal Service Rodanthe acquired a office in 1874 under postm aster Sparrow Pugh; Pugh requested the nam e \"Chickam acomico\" but the Indian nam e was refused by the United States Postal Service. Ed ward Pinner, Jr. becam e postm aster in Mary bley Rodanthe was the first village in Chicam acom ico to get a post office; m ail for the three villages was dropped off da ily by boat. \"From here [the m ail boat] would go to Avon and then to Hatteras,\" explained a villager. Once Frisco and Salvo got post offices, they were included in the route. Th e shallow waters of Pamlico Sound m ade it necessary for the m ail boat to anchor of fshore in a cut known as the \"m ail lead.\" \"There was a fellow who would take a small boat, shove out to the m ail boat, and pick up the m ail,\" an old-tim er reported. T he shove skiff also ferried passengers to and from the m ail boat. Once the highway was paved, m ail boats were re tired from service and posta l item s were delivered by truck. The Midgett brother's bus line also helped out: \"We carried m ail back and forth on the bus,\" reported Anderson Midgett. 7.1.10. Commerc ial Fis hing In the early 1900s, according to Charles W illiam s, the north end of Hatteras Island \"h ad a big lot of fisherm en and they didn't m ake much money.\" He explained that \"They never got cash for the fish. They'd trade them off for potat oes and stuff like that. T hey'd quit their work [after a shipwreck] and everybody in the village would be a salvager\" (Merrill 1979, 12). 88 Chicam acom ico and Ki nnakeet, located a good dist ance from either Ore gon or Hatteras Inlet, were m ore isolated and therefore had a less de veloped economy than the southern villages. Before the Civil W ar fisherm en dried mullet and tr aded it with m ainland plantations f or corn to be ground at the village windm ills. Comm ercial fishing increased in s ignificance at the tu rn of the centu ry, but rem ained an opportunistic endeavor that still involved m ore trade than cash. Anderson Midgett carried clam s in a Model-A Ford up to Currituck to trade for sw eet and Irish potatoes in the late 1930s to early 40s; he and his brothers also ca ught and sold small clam s to Ne ilus Midgett of the First Colony Inn in Nags Head, \"the o nes that were the s ize of a fifty cent p iece. W e would give h im a hundred of them for fifty cent.\" Fish boats or \"buy boats\" such as the Hattie Cree f would anchor offshore in Pam lico Sound. These boats would pick up f ish that was fe rried out in shove skiffs or held at offshore fish houses, such as Joseph Midgett's. The Hattie Creef would \"leave Elizabeth City and com e to W anchese,\" explained an old-timer. \"Then fro m Wanche se she would com e here. From here she would go to Avon and then to H atteras.\" Another early buy boat was called the Lloyd Junior . The Coast Guard began digging a channel and harbor on the sound side of Rodanthe in 1936, to the great convenience of fisherm en who no longer had to haul fish out in the sound to meet buy-boats. There were about three fish hous es operating at any given tim e in Rodanthe before the 1950s. One was owned by Etheridg e Seafood in W anchese, another by E d Lym an who obtained it from Herbert Midgett, and a third was owned by Globe Fish Com pany in Elizabeth City. Fish houses com peted fo r a fisherm an's catch in a bidding war: Say you bid five cents a pound. The next m ight say five and a half cents, and then the next six. They would just holler it out. Th e boat was sitting in the m iddle of the creek, and they were bidding on [its contents]. Whoever was running the house for the Globe Fish Com pany would have to call up Elizabet h City on the old crank telephone to find out 89 what the Daniels brothers wanted you to pa y for them . Whoever was the highest bidder, that boat would go there and unload. Fish houses were the earliest facilities to ship in ice, delivered by boa t after the turn of the century in 300-pound blocks. Ice wa s packed in sawdust and chipped off as needed. Once roads were im proved and the O regon Inlet Bridge was bu ilt, com panies trucked ice in and fish out of Rodanthe. A couple of sm all fish houses operated at the harbor until recent years, and today, in 2004, the few rem aining commercial fisherm en either \"pack out\" or unload their catch at Avon Seafood-the one rem aining fish house in Kinnakeet ,-or carry their fish via pickup trucks and coolers to Austin Seafood in Nags Head. A d ealer in Nags H ead counted one or two dozen remaining fisherm en from the greater Chicam acom ico region, \"Juniors and Seniors, all of them ,\" and said that those who \"stick\" or keep fishing are a rare breed that want to fish for the sake of fishing; you \"can't educate him out of it. Three cam ps were located near New Inlet, 5.6 miles north of the vi llage; two were fish camps and one was St. Claire Midgett's hunting ca mp on Jack Shoal grass. These camps were most active between 1933 and 1945 when Ne w Inlet was open (Payne 1985). 7.1.11. Livestock and Gardening Stock was grazing on the north end of Hatte ras Island as early as 1630, as settlers discovered that fencing was expe nsive and \"the most desirable rangelands were those surrounded by water\" (DeBlieu 1998, 27). Rodanthe, like the rest of Hatteras Island and Ocracoke, m anage d herds of free ranging cattle, sheep, and horses until state legislators prohibited loose livestock on the island in 1935. A steer was shot periodical ly to \"kill a beef\" for m eat; however, when legislation passed banning free ranging livestock on Hatteras Island in 1935, and statewide (i.e., 90 Ocracoke) in 1957, m any of the w ilder cattle were shot and a bounty paid. Anderson Midgett recalled that their f ather raised hogs, chickens, horses, and a f ew cattle. \"We would butcher the cattle right where they f ell and cut them up. We 'd take the m eat through the villages and sell it to get rid of it, so it wouldn' t spoil. Everybody did that. Sam e way with the hogs. Everyone had little sm oke houses.\" Livestock g razed on salt m eadow grass, cord gras s, and low s hrubs. Because of the grazing habits of the large herds of anim als, red-cedar tim ber activity of the 1800s, and the devastation of storm s, Rodanthe was largely bare-beach. W ith the exception of Buxton and Frisco, f ew Hatter as locations h ad substantial foliage by the m id-19th century (Dunbar 1956, 47). Rodanthe f amilies typic ally had sm all ga rdens where th ey gr ew an assortm ent of vegetables that survived a sandy soil, such as co llards. People had grove s of fig trees and yards full of pepperm int; they canned their own ve getables and m ade fruit preserves. 7.1.12. Significant Places Most Rodanthe natives have fam ily burial pl ots located in a variet y of places throughout the village, including at long-abando ned hom eplaces, yards, and along th e main road. These small cem eteries are sacred to v illagers, and co unt as th eir m ost cherished spaces on the is land. Joyce Rucker's fam ily plot, for example, is located where her childhood hom e once stood before it was m oved. Her parents are buried there as we ll as her husband; alth ough the old hom e is no longer there, she plans to be buried there as well. Villagers feel strongly about their ho meplaces, as m any were born at hom e, and have fond m emories of growing up in a particular house. It was not uncomm on for houses to be moved on \"bedways and rollers\" after bad floods or when a fa mily m oved to a new village. 91 Some hom eplaces today are abandon ed and crum bling, fixed up and resid ed in by newcom ers, changed in to stores o r shops, surrou nded by m odern hom es built by family, or s till lived in by a family m ember. 7.1.13. Rituals and Community E vents 7.1.13.1. Old Christmas Rodanthe is only Outer Banks village that st ill hosts an \"Old Christm as\" celeb ration- a long-held tradition fining feature of the northernmost comm unity. \"The custom is a carry-over from Epiphany and the T welve days of Christm as celeb rated by the first English settlers\" (Wechter 1975, 150). Vill agers held Old Christm as on Ja nuary fifth, or Twelfth Night Eve, but in recent years celeb rate it on the Satu rday closes t to January fifth for the co nvenience of out-of-town kin. Celebrating \"tw o Christm ases\" can be traced to England' s adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1752 which shortened the y ear by eleven days; this change went unnoticed and then ign ored and res isted by isolated gr oups of Protestan includ ing comm unities on the Outer Banks 1985). Village rs offer a Biblica l explana tion of their ce lebration: Old Christm is d ays after the reg ular Christm as becaus e the wise m en showed up after twelv e days,\" explained an islander. Early accounts indicate that there were religious overtones to the event that, to the dism ay of som e, have be come lost in the m erriment over the years. In the old days...villagers were awakened by th e sound of eerie m usic. The strange notes were produced by serenaders who carried hom emade fifes and drum s...Be hind them marched Sunday school m embers. Every villa ger...joined in the procession, which by noon had reached...a table of m onstrous proporti ons spread with al l the \"fixings\" of Christm as...Prayers were said...and thanks were offered for God's bountiful care... Honest, earnest religion was practiced daily. Old Christm as was a f ull culmination of it (Wechter 1975, 50). 92 It is not clear if islanders always donned costum es for the Old Christm as procession, but the earliest accounts described m ummer-type practices as residents from all three Chicam acom ico village s \"disguised them selves w ith old s tockings and c lothes. The wom en would dress up as m en and the m en as wom en\" (Midgett, Virginia 1979, 35). By the early 20th century b lackface m instrels becam e part of th e event, and th e motley group would march door- to-door, begging for pies and othe r contributions to the community feast. Chickens were stolen the night before. \"I [stole chickens] a couple of times. I got shot at one night, but I think they was shooting in the air. They expected their chic kens to be raided - it was all the excitem ent you had.\" An im portan t tradition in the Old Chr istmas procession was the beating of a pre- Revolutionary drum by a m ember of the Payne family. Although the drum and fife procession no longer exists, the story of the drum lives on. One legend of th e drum is described by Charles Whedbee: a Scottish wa rrior was c linging to th e drum after his ship went d own in the Great Autum n Storm of 1757. He was spied in the wa ters off Roda nthe, and rescued by a man nam ed Payne. The warrior, Donald McDonald, m arried into the community, but having no children of his own, left the drum to the Payne fam ily, who have held a p lace of honor in the Old Christm as tradition ever since (W hedbee 1978). Another legend was told by Brad Payne, who was the drum beater when interviewed in the 1950s. The Payne fa mily, he explained, are descendants of three b rothers from England who shipwrecked of f Rodanthe. Two settled on the bank s, while one settled in Hyde County. He discounted the idea that the drum washed ashore, claim ing that it was used by a com pany of m ilitia on the Lower Ba nks at K innakeet (N orfolk et a. 1 951). A descendan t of the Payne fam ily who recen tly atte nded Old Christm as said that the dru m was now \"probably in som ebody's attic in W anchese.\" 93 At least as early as the 1920s Chicam acom ico children would participate in the Old Christm as \"children's pageant\", organized by local school or Sunday school teachers. Elderly residen t Lovie Midg ett recalled the p lays, costumes, candy pu lls, and p rocessions with noisem akers that occurred when she was a child. She also recalled a poem that sh e had learn ed for Old Christm as: Of all the days folks celebrate, there's one that's sim ply grand, And that is good Old Christm as with joys on every hand. Of course, you can't expect to fi nd that joy all set on giving. You've got to stir around a bit with love instead of hating. If you can't buy gifts just becau se yo ur purse is flat, Don't go fretting and worrying over that. There's p eace and joy a plenty and a m essage m ighty sweet In the good Old Merry Christm as you can say to folks you m eet. The lifesaving/Coast Guard station s played a central role in \"Bankers\" lives, and Old Christm as was no exception. As m any Chicam acomico m en were Surfmen, the station crew spearheaded the Old Christm as event for m any year s. \"The m ain event on Old Christm as would take place at two o'clock of a day,\" reported an old-tim er. \"The crowd would gather up to the lifeboat station. (Surfm an) Thom as Payne would take six apples and put one at a tim e on his head, and Captain Ben Midgett w ould shoot it off his head with a .22 rifle\" (Midgett 1979, 36). The oyster shoot used to take place at the Chic amacom ico Life Saving/Co ast Guard station, and in fact was started by Surfm an as a test of skil l. Today it happens behi nd the comm unity center that used to be Rodanthe School. An early account described anot her practice that no longer exis ts: villagers would gather on the beach at m idnight after the Jan uary fifth festivities to w atch th e \"weird action of the cattle\": [The cattle] would f all on their knees at m idnight and m ake low m urmuring noises as if they were praying. The people believed this was the proper tim e to celebrate because the anim als play ed an im portant par t in th e nativ ity. Af ter the ca ttle d ispersed and retu rned 94 to the grassland, the folk would begin thei r journey hom e, stopping at several different houses for hot coffee and cold sw eet tater pie (Midgett 1979, 37). The highlight of Old Christm as in Rodanthe ha s long been the appearance of \"Old Buck,\" a mythological bull. No one is sure when Old Buck becam e a part of the celeb ration, but by the turn of the 20th century Surfm an Ben Payne was taking \"an old pole and putting a cow's head on it,\" leading a procession through th e villages directly af ter the test of m arksm anship. \"We m ade \"Old Buck\" out of a steer's head, including horns, and attached it to a wooden fram e. A blanket was thrown over the fram e to cover two m en who provided legs and am bulation\" (Midgett 1979, 37). Ben Payne's son Bradford took over upon his death, and led Old Buck through the communities until p assing the resp onsibility to J ohn Herbert. Today, in 2 004, John Herbert's son drives u p each year from Florida to assum e his inhe rited obligation. Around the tim e of the Depression, Old Christm as festivities w ere moved to the Rodanthe schoolhouse and included a square dance. Old Buck, still a cow 's head and skins with two m en hidden below, m ade a surprise appearan ce during the dance, kicking and bucking to the glee and horror of children. It was considered lucky to touch Old Buck, but John Herbert fended off the crowd with a larg e staff. The occasion al teenager who jumped on Old Buck's back would be thrashed about and bucked off. J ohn Herber t's son recalled a year when carpet tacks were placed just b elow the blankets, poin t side up, surp rising the bo ys who tried to m ount Ol d Buck. Today Old Buck is still led around the room , but the old bu ll's feet m ove slowly compared to h is friskier days. Like all m ythological figures, Old Buck has m ystical origins. The great b lack and white bull, like the hardiest of Bankers' ancestors, wa s the only survivor of a ship that wrecked off Rodanthe during a terrible storm . A Chicam acomico surfm an on watch duty \"saw the beautiful 95 anim al standing on the bank.\" He fetched the rest of the crew, and after they all observed the magnificent crea ture, the y turned a ll the cows loose to im prove the gene pool. The strang e anim al soon becam e acquainted with the cows an d had a field day, siring many calves. Thereafter he becam e dom esticate d and was lo ved and resp ected by the natives. Each year on January fifth he was led through the villages . Som etimes children would ride on his back (Midgett 1979, 37). But, one day Old Buck \"becam e restless and trek ked off to Trent woods lo oking for greener grass. There he was shot an d kill ed by a hunter and becam e a legend\" (Mid gett 1979, 37). So, each January, the story goes, Old Buck co mes out of Trent woods at Frisco to show up in Rodanthe and scare little ch ildren at Old Christm as. \"That mysterious old steer would com e out after bad children to scare the kids into being good.\" Author Charles Whedbee records a slightly different v ersion of this m yth: Old Buck was \"Bucca,\" a great fighting bull b rought to the New W orld by a Spaniard. The bull becam e possessed by a dragon during the journey; when the ship broke up off Ha tteras, he sw am to shore with two sailors hanging for dear life to his horns. The sailo rs married into the Hatter as Ind ian tribe, s tarting the firs t \"Mustees\" or fair- haired, m ixed blood Indians. Old Buck disappeared into the T rent, appearing in Rodanthe each Old Christm as (W hedbee 1978). Perhaps m ore frightening than Old Buck was another Old C hristm as tradition that has becom e subdued in recent years : brawling. Me n from various island communities, as well as brave souls who would venture ov er from Stum py Point or Wanchese, would settle yearlong disputes with drunken fistfight s. The fights broke out spont aneously throughout the day but particularly occurred at the dance when dar kness fell and m uch alcohol had been consum ed. Fights often revolved aro und wom en, but were als o an express ion of villag e rivalry. N o hard feelings or resentm ents carried ove r into the next day; the goal wa s to s tart the year w ith a b lack 96 eye and a clean slate. M en \"got th eir years wo rth of hard feelings over with in one night,\" recalled an islander. \"T he next day they were best friends.\" In the early years, the Lifesaving Station crews procured m uch of the food for the community feast, heading up oyster expeditions a nd cooking chicken stews. However, once the celebration was m oved to the Rodanthe school (n ow the Community Center), local wom en took over the cooking, m aking chicken and pastry as well as side dishes and dessert. The team of six or so wom en who had been in charg e for m any decades, how ever, annou nced in 200 1 that they were retiring and passing the res ponsibility to their daughters. The m ajority of their daughters lived off-island, in Norfolk, Virgin ia Beach, Ch esapeake, o r Elizabeth City. Yet, these \"daughters of Rodanthe\" rose to the challenge, and after a som ewhat rough transition pledged not only to continue the Old Christ mas tradition, but to resurrect so me of the older practices such as children 's pageants an d gift-giving. So, wom en who do not reside in R odanthe are now the prim e expeditors of Old Christm as. Rather th an posing a th reat to th e bonds of culture and community, the comm itment of thes e wom en to uphol d and preserve local traditions has served to strengthen the ties that bind. Old Christm as has long been a hom ecoming fo r far-flung residents serving at distant Coast Guard stations or other p laces of e mployment. Even th ose who have m arried non- islanders and have fam ily respons ibilities elsewhere point out th at \"two Christm ases\" enables them to spend the firs t elsewhere and Old Chri stmas at their \"true hom e\" in Rodanthe. \" We always knew that there was no place on earth like Rodanthe at Old Christm as - it was the only place to be o n this date,\" said a daugh ter of a Coas t Guardsm en who spent m any years living away. Her sister added, \"We all hav e flaws, and we all know each other's flaws. But you com e home, and none of that m atters - you are loved for who you are.\" 97 98The way Old Christmas is expressed today captures Rodanthe's ambivalence toward tourism and modernity; it also hi ghlights the village's tenacious sp irit in wanting to retain their Chicamacomico identity in the face of rapid ch ange (see Figures 7.1.4-9, below). The event is no longer a strictly loca l celebration whereby villagers catch the oysters, supply the chickens, or provide their own procession and sq uare dance music. Within the last three decades organizers of Old Christmas began advertising the event to the general public a nd charging an admission fee. This was necessary in order to pay for the band (usually from the Norfolk area), the oysters (trucked in from Louisiana or Florida), a nd groceries (from Food Lion, a local chain store grocer) for the chicken and pastry dinner. Although the event is open to the public, organizers do not aggressively push it as a tourist-friendly celebration and e xpress the concern that off-island communities such as Nags Head or Norfolk would \"steal\" Old Christmas and make it a touristy specta cle if it was no longer held in Rodanthe. Old Christmas has the feel of attending someone else's family reunion, not only because most of the attendees are kin, but al so because some of the customs are foreign if not inscrutable to the visitor. This alien feel, as well as hint s of the old practice of brawling, have fueled a widespread misconception that non -locals are unwelcome at Old Christmas and are in danger of being attacked if they attend. Yet, many of the native participants bemoan th at Old Christmas is \"not the same,\" having become too tame, commercialized, and mixed with unfamiliar faces. \"It's not like it used to be where it was a spur-of-the-moment thing. Everybody would go out oystering and get a few oysters and either donate the chicken or stea l them.\" At a recent Old Christmas a man announced to a long table of diners, \"I thought I wa s the last Midgett alive!\" a comical statement in light of the fact that virtually everyone at the table, not to me ntion at the event as a whole, was a Midgett or from Midgett stock. People also wonde r if Old Christm as is dying - som e believe it will f ade aw ay within a f ew years, while o thers point to its lo ng history and explain that it has always waxed and waned but continues nonetheless. Participants and or ganizers walk a tight rope betwee n the m odern and the tra ditional; the fact that the celeb ration incorpora tes both modern-day conveniences (e.g., sto re-bought food, imported band, adm ission fee) an d trad itional practices (e.g., \"Old Buck,\" ki n-heavy attendance, m inimal advertisem ent) suggests that Old Christm as is, am ong other things, a ritual of cultural pride and resi stance on the Outer Banks. It is through long-standing cultu ral events, such as Old Christm as, that participants express their pride in who they ar e, where th ey ar e from, and the histo ry and trad itions that, de spite hardships, have been passed down. In refusing to relinquish their unusual rite or m ake it innocuous enough to suit the v isitor's palate, Rodanthe villagers st aunchly resist the forces of hom ogenization that are transform ing coastal areas with an unpr ecedented degree of wealth an d tourism .

Coast Guard and the Military The first Midgett to settle in Rodanth e, acco rding to fam ily legend, was Matth ew Midgett who washed ashore in th e early 18th century af ter his ship wre cked during a hurricane. He married a local girl and had ei ght children, starting what would becom e the m ost common and influential nam e in the Chicam acom ico region, as well as a clan of ab le-bodied seam en who would carry on a line of decorated S urfmen and Coast Guardsm en (DeBlieu 1998). The Chicamacom ico Lifesaving Station was es tablished in 1874 in the village then known as North Chicam acom ico. Six surfm en lived at th e station from Decem ber until M arch for $40 dollars per m onth. In 1883 the season w as expanded from September 1 through April after m any lives were lost in the fall months, and eventually the m en were on duty year 'round (Stick 1958, 172). By 1899 the m en rece ived around $60 dollars per m onth. The first keeper was Bannister Midg ett III, w ho held the po st until h e retired in 1916. In 1897 he received a box in the m ail containing an internal combustion naphtha engine. Legend 102 has it that B annister Mid gett distrusted the ne w technology, and only tested the engin e because of the crews' curiosity and enthusiasm. The engi ne roared into action, th rusting the skiff with Midgett aboard out into the sound. When he returned, to the as tonishm ent of his m en, he was rowing the s kiff, and had beaten the engine with the oar (M acNeill 1958 ). Rasmus Midgett of Rodanthe was awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal of Honor for single-handedly rescuing ten people off the ship wreck Priscilla in 1899. For all the prestige associated w ith such an honor, not a m ention of this or his service in the L ifesaving Service is noted on his headstone, underscoring how m uch a part of everyday village life the business of saving lives was on the Ou ter Banks (Figure 7.1.10). Figure 7.1.10. Ras mus and Mary Midgett Grave. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. In 1915 the Lifesaving S ervice was com bined with the Revenue Cutter Service to form the U.S. Coast Guard; Surfm en were sim ply abso rbed into the new organization. In its 80 years 103 of operation, the Chicam acom ico Lifesaving Stat ion was rebu ilt on ce in 1 911 and had a total of three k eepers. In 1918 the Chicam acom ico Coast Guard stat ion crew undertook one of the m ost daring rescues in th e histo ry of life saving. T he 7,000 ton British tank er Mirlo exploded and sp lit after hitting a m ine or torpedo. Six surfm en (five Midgetts and one O'Neal) deployed their boat through the surf, rowed five m iles offshore, and navigated through an ocean of oily fire and exploding debris to shuttle victim s back to shore; after four trips, they had saved 42 of the 51 man crew. The six res cuers each earned Gold Lifesaving Medals from the British governm ent, and the Grand Cross of the Am erican Cross of Honor from the Coast Gu ard; \"In the seventy- year history of the Coast Guar d, officials have aw arded only el even Grand Crosses\" (MacNeill 1958, 35). One of the governor-appointed wreck comm issioners of the late 19th, early 20th centu ry was Israel Midgett from Rodant he. He was in charge of the Chicam acom ico Bank, and other comm issioners took care of the Kinnakeet and H atteras Banks. The wreck comm issioner would undertake the \"vendues\" or shipwreck auctions. In the early 1930s the state organized the effo rt to build \"three parallel lines of ocean- front dunes from the Nor th Carolina-Virginia border to Ocracoke Inlet\" to stabilize the beach and prevent erosion (MacNeill 1958, 8). This project was turned over to the Civilian Conservation Corps and the W ork Projects Adm inistration in 1936, and camps were established at Chicam acom ico and Buxton. WPA workers lived in bunkhouses placed on two barges that were tied up at Black Mar Gut, a m ere creek before the Rodanthe harbor was dug in 1936. The m en collected b rush and lim bs left over f rom the 1933 storm and piled it alon g the beach to collect blowing sand and build dunes. WPA laborers also bui lt a new road in Chicam acom ico from 104 topsoil collected from north Roda nthe; villagers with m emories of World W ar I jokin gly referred to it as the \"Bur ma Road.\" The dune-building project was adm inistered by the National Park Service after the establis hment of the National Seashore in 19 53. Efforts to stabilize th e beach ceased, how ever, in 197 3 when the National Park Service ch anged its polic y of inte rvention \"letting nature take its course.\" 7.1.15. Politica l Life The Lifesaving Stations of Hatteras and Ocrac oke were integr al to local p olitics, a s village m en vied to secure a job as Surfm an, a governm ent job with a steady paycheck. The station keeper held the most in fluence, and villagers supported those keepers who they believed would put in a good word for them or their kin. The role of local politic s in lifesaving raised concerns in the early history of the service, expressed in a governm ent report that warned of \"control...by petty local politicia ns, whose aim was to subordinate the service to their personal ends; their m ethod being to endeavor to pack the stations with their own creatures, without the slightest respect to use or com petency\" (Stick 1958, 171). Such problem s were soon ironed out, however, and the Chicam acom ico Station earned the utmost respect of governm ent officials. Political lif e in sm all communitie s can occur in unlike ly pla ces. Rodanthe is a c ase in point. Josep h McClellan \"Mac\" Mid gett, a legen dary figure known for his large statu re, pirate- like appearance, daring-do antics, and past ba rroom and Old Christm as brawling, ow ns Island Convenience Store in Rodanthe wi th his wife and fa mily. Even in the harsh winter m onths, residents can count on the store - a central m eeting place in Ch icam acom ico - to be open with hot coffee, sandwiches, and carryout dinners. Although Mac Midgett cuts a gruff and alm ost frightening f igure, he has a reputation for kind- heartedness, extending credit to residents who 105 need it and forgiving the debts of those who have fallen on especi ally hard tim es. He runs a large garage and towing com pany be hind Isla nd Convenience, and the sandy ridges behind the store are bedecked with junk cars. H e has a fe w torn-up, greasy chairs in the garage, and the most im portant comm unity busin ess and gossip likely tak es place there am ong the m en who sit with Mt. Dews or lunch in hand. Mac Midgett' s influence was evident in the 2004 election, as he won a seat on the Dare County Comm ission for the third tim e, beating a popular incum bent. Despite h is politica l and business a cumen, Mac Mi dgett still considers himself a comm ercial fisherm an, and lives in a modest home built fo r $15,000 in the early 1970s, revalued today at $340,000. His political philosophy is old-gu ard, opposing zo ning because people sho uld \"do what they want and m ind their own business\"; he reasons that well-conn ected residents would get around the zoning laws anyway (Nolan 2005, 13). 7.1.16. Modernity and Perceptions of Change : Rodanthe natives, like other Outer B ankers, have witnessed trem endous c hange in the last 50 years. T hey have experienced the introduction of electricity, refrig eration, indoor plum bing, a paved road and bridge to the m ainland, establis hment of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, tourism , mass communication, and an array of m odern conveniences. Villagers share the region- wide am bivalence toward changes that have transfor med island life, glad to have an increase in econom ic opportunities and a decrea se in isolation, but wary th at the underpinnings of their cultu ral iden tity are in da nger of giving out. Noth ing expres ses this am bivalence m ore than th e modern Old Christm as celebration described above. Managed by the National Park Service, the beautifully restored Chicam acomico Lifesaving S tation is open to visito rs as an his torical attractio n. This Stati on is a sym bol of the 106 village's history as a seafaring community and a present-day exam ple of the com plex relations between locals and non-locals and contested ideas of what m akes a \"community.\" Lists of early lifesaving crews are com prised m ainly of those b earing the Midgett surnam e, and residents today can trace th eir ancestry to particular heroes of the pre-Coas t Guard era w ho risked th eir lives to save victim s of foundering and wrecked ships. But, few native resident s staff the Lifesaving Station; the m ajority of those who volunteer their efforts m oved to Hatteras Island from elsewhere and sim ply took an interest in local history. Som e native resi dents express the opinion that their his tory has been co-opted b y those w ho do not accu rately represe nt it yet wan t to \"be in charge,\" while som e Life saving St ation volunteers suggest that loca ls have little curiosity about their own history and lack the de sire to \"get involved.\" A lo cal villager describes frustration toward non-locals' interpretation of family history: \"They hear th ese stories and they think they know who the people are and they put it together and it's the gr eatest m ess you ever heard when it com es out.\" 107 7.2. Waves 7.2.1. Name, Place, and Features Form erly known as South Chicam acomico and, later, South Rodanthe, Waves is sandwiched between Salvo and Rodanthe on the north end of Hatteras Island (Figure 7.2.1.). postal s ervice Chicam acom hard to spell; \"Waves P.O.\" was selected in 1939 with a \"reference to the environm ent\" (Payne 1985, 192). The fact that villagers referred to the \"P.O.\" after \"W aves\" for the next 50 years was a rem inder that the name was picked for the post office; it also expressed a strong \"reluctance to give up using the original nam e of Chica macom ico\" (ibid).

The village borders are no longer m arked beca use, acco rding to a resident, surfers and beachgoers \"keep tak ing the W aves sign.\" Like the other co mmunities o f Chica macom ico, it is difficult to detect a village am id the gift shops, rental hom es, and under-construction subdivisions such as \"W ind Over W aves.\" But, in the past, borders were clear: \"If you was out 108 in the sound in a boat,\" explai ned a villager, \"and looked back at the shoreline you would see three clum ps. And you knew W aves was the m iddle one.\" A Hatteras villager described W aves as \"just some houses strung along,\" but added that he had fam ily there and was always m ade to feel welcomed. Early fam ily surnames of W aves incl uded F lower, Meekins, Midgett, O'Neal, Pugh, and Wallis (S tick 1958). Old tim ers recall few trees in th e village, and abo ut \"twelv e, fifteen houses in each of these v illages\" (Figures 7.2.2-3.). Although som e of the old hom es are still inhabited or are crum bling behind brush and bushes, most native s live in m odular homes, trailers, and brick ranch homes tucked along the highway and toward the s ound. A villager stressed that people's lives were oriented toward the sound, not the ocean: Back in those days people didn't build on the ocean side. They viewed it as foolish. Everybody built on [the sound] side. They knew eventually it was going to wash away over there. The bulk of their livelihood was on this sound. Most of their fishing was done in the sound.

Large ren tal houses now dom inate th e landsca pe, both on the ocean sid e and in section s bordering the sound (see Figure 7.2.4, below). Figure 7.2.4. W ind over W aves Developm ent. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. 110 There was once a sound-side cow pasture on th e south end of Waves fenced off on three sides that doubled as a landing strip (Map 7.2). A doctor would som etimes fly in from Manteo to deliver babies or tend to the very ill, and the pilot had to stand by to keep the cows from \"licking [the Piper C ub] to death.\" Today \"W ind Over Waves,\" an upscale housing developm ent, stands in the form er pasture. Like m ost village s of Hatteras and Oc racoke, W aves has a s traight shore line on the Atlantic side, and a curvy shor eline on the sound side, with num erous cuts, coves, creeks, islands, and shoals. Older fisherm en worry that the nam es of the sm aller creeks, unm arked on commercial charts, will disappear with them (see Salvo Chapter for Maps 8.9.2.-8.9.4.). Som e of the creeks are natural and others are m an-made. A resident, f or exam ple, hired an outfit to dig a small harbor off his sound side property in 1958 f or $500, a project that , if attem pted today, would unlikely be approved by officials enforc ing the Coasta l Area Man agement Act (CAMA). \"A guy from Collington done it,\" h e explain ed. \"Dug it with an old drag li ne bucket.\" 111 Map 7.2. Waves Village with Historical Site s (not to scale). Sketch by B. Garrity-B lake. 112 7.2.2. Relation to Other Villages a nd Beyond When asked how W aves differs from Roda nthe and Salvo, an old-tim er laughed, \"it isn't unique any more.\" He characterized each vi llage in term s of w ho lived th ere: It was never really unique when you get right down to it. It was just a village where people lived. In Rodanthe they had Midgetts, O'Neals, Meekins, and Grays. In W there was ily of Grays and one fam ily of O'Neals and th e rest we re all Midgetts. In Salvo they were prim arily Paines, Hoopers, Grays. It was kind of clannish m ore or less. Each village had its own clan. Waves and Rodanthe were in tertwined in te rms of kin; as th e bulk of families in the se two villages were Midgetts. Before W orld W ar II ev ery fa mily in Waves had the surnam e Midgett with the exception of an O' Neal and Gray household. Village rs in Chicam acom ico were no strange rs to southern c ommunities like Hatter as and Avon. Not only did th e Midgett bus line help st itch the villag es toge ther; m any families had relatives in more distan t locations as well and visited them regularly. Som eone explained that his m other was from Avon, and he grew up visiting there of ten. A Hatteras re sident said that his mother was from Waves, and his father, a fisher men at the far south end of the island, would drive a Model-A through the sand clear to Chicam acom ico to court her in the 1940's. \"Courting at the tim e meant sittin g on the porch,\" he added. \"And turn around an d drive back .\" Because of his m other's kin ties, he grew up sp ending m uch of his tim e in W aves. School sports and teenage entertainm ent pl ayed a role in inter-comm unity visiting. A villager who went to sch ool in th e late 1930s to mid 1940s r ecalled that the \"only time we ever went (to the southern end of th e island) was when I had ball gam es. Rodanthe School would go down to Avon or Hatteras to play.\" School ga mes, he added, only occurred on Saturday, as \"there wasn't any getting out of school to play games.\" After the road was built, h e made m ore frequent trips, and m et his wife, a \"Kinnak eeter,\" at a dance at Tandy's in Frisco. 113 7.2.3. School Waves, like Salvo and Rodanthe, once housed a one-room schoolhouse when the village was known as South Rodanthe. \"It was a dilapi dated looking building, \" recalled an elderly resident. The schoolhouse in W aves was closed upon consolidation, when children of all three Chicam acom ico villages began attending Rodanthe School in the early 1930s. Clas ses were tiny- a villager recalled gr aduating with five students in his cl ass \"and those five stayed together till we went to college.\" Until buses becam e available, child ren walked the two m iles or so to scho ol each day. Occasionally the tide would ris e and make the j ourney difficult. W hen the bus cou ldn't m ake it, the \"Coast Guard station would com e over and pi ck us up on big governm ent horses, recalls one long-term resident. \"They'd com e in this wagon and bring us hom e.\" The horses w ere otherwise used to haul C oast Guard rescue boats to the wate r; that the Gua rdsmen enlis ted the ir horses to pull a wagonload of children to school is one of m any exam ples illustrating how the Service was very m uch a part of everyday community life. 7.2.4. Stores Small general sto res that proliferated in Banker v illages in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were fam ily-run operations. Som e of the early 1900s stores in Waves included the C.A. Midgett store, and the A. H. Gr ay Genera l Merchandise, run by Asa Gray. According to one of his grandsons, Asa Gray carried everythi ng from \"chicken feed to kerosene.\" He eventually had a trucking business, taking orde rs for m erchandise, picking it up off island, and delive ring it to village rs: 114 He had a covered wagon truck. ... P eople in th e neighborhood, they didn't have vehicles so they would com e to my grandfather's store...and they would get in on Sunday mornings for church and Sunday school. One of Asa Gray's sons worked at the genera l store as a child, and eventually becam e the \"Pepsi Cola m an.\" Soda becam e very popular on the island as an alternative to the po or-quality drinking water. He tru cked Pepsi Cola from Elizabeth City to each village of Hatteras Island in the 1940s and early 1950s. \"He had to com e down on the sand roads, across the ferry,\" recalled his son. The ferry was little m ore than a \"rinky -dink\" wooden rig with a chain hoist that would maneuver a ram p for cars. \"You had to try to get his attentio n by waving your arm s because he sat on the north side and he would com e across a nd get you. It was a full day to get up there and another to get back.\" The Pepsi Cola m an kept two-by-eights or two-by-twelves shoved underneath his truck for use in soft sand. \"He would pull those board s out from underneath that truck and start boarding his way. He'd take one board and go a little ways, and another board.\" His son often accom panied him on the long Pepsi runs through out the 1940 s and 50s, and therefore visited all the stores on the island. When I was a kid the g rocery sto res is wh ere all the older m en would hang out in the afternoon. It was gathering places yo u should say . Som etimes there would be ten, twelve, fourteen m en in the afternoon s itting around talking, som e of the m playing dominos, checkers, and stuff like that. The village stores were ofte n forerunners in new technology. They were the earliest places in Waves to acqu ire telephon es, Delco genera tors for electricity, and refrigeration. Stores were also v illage gathering places. A W aves na tive rem embered when v illage m en would gather at his great-grandfather's store to hear the boxing m atches on th e radio. A wom an described her hard-of-hearing father w ho listened to the news by putting the handle of a fork between his teeth and resting his head against the ra dio. Radios were battery operat ed until electricity cam e to the 115 island in 1948. Stores were points of connection between villages, and conduits of communication. \"W hen you were traveling you woul d typically stop - even after the place was paved and there's not necessarily a reason to stop - to just kind of visit, maybe buy a Pepsi or a gallon of gas, chat for 20 m inutes and go on. Keep up with what was going on.\" 7.2.5. Pastimes and Childhood Activities With the absence of television and other modern distractions, children growing up in Waves relied on their im aginations. An elderly resident recalled \"Play Pr etties,\" w here she and her friends would collect broken glass from the many trash piles in the vill age and s tick them in the sand to f orm little do ll shap es. \" The glass w as their satin dresses, \" she expla ined. Her daughter, growing up in the WW II era, said that sh e and her friends played pretend. \"The three things that life revolved around he re was church, school, and post offi ce so you played all three. Everybody could preach, all kids could preach really good serm ons.\" In the early 20th century, square dancing or house dan ces was still considered a sin by the Methodist church. \"That was a long tim e ago wh en people had different ideas,\" explained an elderly resident. By the 30s and 40s, however, island dances we re common social events. A village r stressed that there were so few age mates th at all the kids m ore or les s played in \"one big clum p,\" crabbing, sw imming, and e xploring the beach. We used to take old hoops that com e off of barrels and a piece of copper wire and run it down the road and m ake it like we were driv ing a car. There wasn't a whole lot to do. We had to amuse ourselves. W e'd take bottles and play like they were cars; push them around. W e would m ake roads, bridges and und erpasses and stuff. There wasn't a w hole lot of m oney on the island so you didn't get a whole lot. Mostly if you got som ething for Christm as it was clothes. Some residents recalled exploring th e beach during W orld War II and co ming across great gobs of oil on the shore from tankers that had been attacked. 116 7.2.6. Medical Care Before paved roads villagers c ould seek physician help if they wanted to travel to Buxton or Hatteras village, alm ost a fu ll day's trip. Chicam acom ico re sidents relied m ostly on local healers and m idwives, and hired young girls to move in and a ssist n ew mothers. Orenda Midgett, who lived in Rodanthe, was one of the pre-W orld War II m idwives who served expectan t mothers in W aves. Midwives as far as Hatteras village recalled m aking runs as far as the villages at the northe rn end of the island, as did \"Doc Folb,\" who worked out of Buxton in the 1920s. For em ergencies Chicamacom ico resident s sought the help of the Lifesaving or Coast Guard Station servicem en, who could send communi cations and call for an air am bulance. 7.2.7. Early Transportation Elderly villagers recalled traveling about with ca rts pulled by a horse or ox. But, prior to the widespread use of autom obiles, the \"norm al thing was a sailboat, horse, or you walked.\" Villagers to ok advantag e of the Mid gett bus line, and started riding a bus to Rodanthe School in the late 1930s, early 1940s. Once the road was paved, islanders were no t necessarily free of difficultie s. \"The highway wasn't like it is now,\" repor ted a villager. \"A lot of times the road would be washed out and the school bus would ha ve to go out around it. And we'd push it, and it'd get stuck. W e'd push harder com ing back th an getting to school.\" He rem embered the \"Midgett Express\" taking the en tire Methodist youth group to Hatteras for a church m eeting for one dollar a head. Som e island ers began getting their own cars in the m id-1930s, such as old Model-T and Model-A Fords. 117 7.2.7. Postal Service Waves was the last Hatteras island community to receive a post office, as it had long shared services with Rodanthe. The post office was established in 1939 with Anna E. Midgett as postm aster; she sim ply ran the service from her hous e. Villagers were relu ctant to change their community's nam e to Waves, but Waves was the only community that seem s to have adopted a name with an eye toward tourism . A m an explai ned that his aunt, Anna Midgett, had chosen the name because the community does \"have a lo t of wa ves and s torms.\" Like villagers elsewhere, a highlight in the day for Waves residents was m ail call. A wom an recalled rushing to the post office early to visit everybody: But, the best thing was y ou knew each piece of mail ev erybod y got. The p ostmaster would call out the nam es of every piece of mail so you knew who got a letter and who got a packag e. The pack ages were us ually from Sears Roebuck or Montgom ery W ard. After Anna Midgett retired, the post office was run from C.A. Midgett's general store. According to a W aves resident, the post office th en m oved four m ore tim es: first, to a Mr. Edwards' residence in the north part of the villag e, then to two di fferent locations in Rodanthe as part of the R odanthe/W aves post office, and fi nally to the present location as the Rodanthe- Waves-Salvo post office. 7.2.8. Commercial Fishing Almost everyone in the Chicam acom ico regi on was involved in comm ercial fishing, but not necess arily as a full-tim e endeavor. \"Mos t men associated with comm ercial fishing had something to fall back on,\" explained a reside nt. \"If you had som e nets, you set them ; com e along later and check them.\" Fisherm en launched small skiffs in the soun d, dories in the ocean, or kept larger boats at Hattera s or Oregon Inlets; the shallow wa ters and inconvenient location of 118 Rodanthe, Waves, and Salvo m ade it proh ibitiv e for keepin g sizeab le vessels n earby. No fish buyers worked out of Waves. Although a couple small fish houses operated in Salvo, most of the comm erce took place in Rodanthe where buyers would bid on catches of fish. Waves fisherm en did a little crabbing, and tr aveled to Oregon Inlet and Pea Island or Hatteras and Ocracoke Inlets to clam, but acco rding to an old -timer clam s have never b een found in any significant quantity off Chicam acom ico. Clam s were found by \"signing,\" the process of searching for a keyhole shaped indention in th e sand. Som e fisherm en raked clam s, hand dug clam s, even gigged for the bivalves: a \"strai ght prong gig\" was jabbed on the keyhole sign and the clam s would \"pop out of the hole.\" Fisherm en have long worked both th e sound and the ocean. In the sound they use g illnets and pound nets to target bluefish, summer flounder, trout, and m ackerel (see Appendix 1). In the ocean they u se sink nets offshore or work from small beach dories to sein e for spot in Septem ber and speckled trout, striped bass, and puppy drum in la te fall/early winter. Fisherm an I.D. Midget of W aves, who still operates \"a pretty sm art\" dory described the m echanization of the fishery (Figure 7.2.5): Now it's m otorized. But back when I sta rted it was oars. They'd put the net in the boat, row out, com e back ashore. [The net] was pulled by hand. During W orld War II four- wheel drives begin to com e out, so everybody bought surplus vehicles to pull their nets out and to pull their dories with. 119 Figure 7.2.5. I.D. Midge tt and Outer Banks Dory. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. A fisherm an's son bought an old 32-foot sai ling shad boat with a round stern from across the sound in Stum py Point. \"Had the old cypress kn ees in it for tim bers,\" he said, \"and the stem and stern was rotted out of it.\" Their neighbor o ffered to rep lace the stem and stern fo r material costs only, a nd fixed it w ithin a year. But the tr aditional work boat was not suited f or the type of fishing off the shallows of Hatteras: The old m an [that he bought it from ] had been using [the shad boat] for about 60 years. He had put a m otor in it, an e ngine. It worked all right on that side of the sound, Stum py Point, becau se along the shore over there th ey have fairly deep water. But on this side of the sound it was no good because the draft wa s too deep. So everywhere y ou went you were aground. Stum py Point fisherm en once set shad nets on the back edge of the reef off Chicam acom ico. After the Am erican shad becam e scarce in the early part of the 20th century, Stum py Pointers started setting pound nets \"for butter fish, croakers, and tr out\" but did not com pete with 120 Chicam acom ico fisherm en, as they were not yet utilizing pound nets but instead harvested with gillnets. A villager recalled watch ing his great grandm other in th e hous e tying co tton and linen nets from a skein of twine, a common indus try am ong islanders until m ultifilam ent nylon was introdu ced in the 1950s. Houses were typically built with a lo ng hall running down the center of them , and this was where people would tie nets in the winter or at night. His great grandm other \"could get her hand going so fast tying that net that you could hardly see her hand or...the needle.\" She had f our or f ive pins that would h old the twin e. She had needles m ade of little bamboo. My grandfather would m ake the gauge s for her, and that would determ ine the size of the m esh that the net would be. Sh e would say, \"Well I'm going to tie ten yards before I go to bed\" or \"before dinner today I' ll tie five m ore yards.\" She had a piece of twine going over to one of the old tim ey door knobs, and she would have a basket sitting there. She would tie out so far, m aybe tie five or six yards out, and then move it up closer to the doorknob. \"Tying\" net refers to m aking the net from twin e, while \"hanging\" net is attaching corks to the top and lead weights to the bottom. Pre- WWII fisherm en did not have to concern them selves with regulatory m esh sizes, but fished with 25 or 30 yards, considerably sm aller than nets today. The inexpen sive ined and a signif icant change for en. en shifted to \"drop nets\" -nets an chored in such a way to catch m id- to deep-water schools- in the early 1980s. This sh ift occurred prim arily because of a large showing of gray trout that turned into a ten year-long run, and th e introduction of a h ydraulic stern-placed net reel that m ade \"pulling in by hand\" a thing of the past. Drop netter s converged in Hatteras village from W anchese, Stum py Po int, and Engelhard because the boats were re latively sm all (26-25 feet) and in the w inter prevailing northeas t or northwest winds m ade it \"kind of rough up 121 on the north side.\" The crews worked the o cean and sound from October through Jan uary. Rudy Gray of W aves m odifie d his rig to include a T-shap ed stern roller that he lped feed the net from the re el to th e water : When m y boat cam e in, it was like a gatheri ng. P eople com ing to take a look at the gill net reel plu s the stern ro ller that I had custom made for that boat. They had seen that reel before [in Hatte ras] but this here was a rea l nice g ill net reel m ade out of fiberglas s. It held 2,000 yards of netting that we used in the ocean. You go out there and there'd be two guys straining to pull back the nets by hand with a lot of fish in them . But, the gill net reel just sat there doing all the work. So, som e of the local guys started building those gill n et reels , making them out of wood. Today, we have a modern drop n et fleet. Two years ago, in 2002, Gray decided to switc h from comme rcial fishing to charter boat fishing, while his brother rem ained a commercia l fisherm an. His decision was based on the bleak outloo k for the fishing indus try, and increased res trictions. \"Every thing was do wnhill,\" he explain ed. \"There was n o uphill any more.\" He enjoys his cu stom ers, especia lly ch ildren. \"I love to see children catch fish. That can really get m y heart a thum ping.\" He finds charter boat fishing easier in his m iddle-aged years, but is not immune to the im pact of restrictions. Particula rly painf ul are r ed drum restrictions that preven t his custom ers - and him self - from keeping the \"old drum ,\" mature drum fish that are m ore than twenty-seven inches long. Old drum is a key ingr edient in a trad itional and beloved Oute r Banks dish . \"You got to have those big fish to m ake that drum stew or a m uddle. W e take and thicken ours and m ake a gravy into it. W e put it over the top of the cornbrea d.\" A fish dealer added, \"Y ou can't drink whiskey with that. If you did, you'd die [of pleasure]!\" I.D. Midgett of ent was \"lim iting us to death. W e're a dying breed, I can assure you that.\" Fishing wa s merely supplem ental to his retirem ent from the ferry service, and he \"sur ely wouldn't advise a young m an to go into it.\" His son, however, is now, in 2004, one of the island's few rem aining full-tim e commercial fisherm en. Most career 122 fisherm en have either be en forced to f ind additio nal sourc es of incom e due to dwindling prof its or, finding the service-industry m ore lucrative, have chosen to ha ve non-fishing jobs on the side. Midgett rem arked that som e of his grandchildren enjoyed fishing with him , while a couple of others \"didn't want to be around th e boat. More power to them.\" I think a way of life is going to be lost if nothing else. A he ritage is going to be lost. Other than that it's just like everything else. If it's not pr oductive do away with it. L ike the cowboy, he's gone, so the fisherm en are going to be gone too. Farm ers and fisherm en always had a hard tim e. The farm er gets subsidized, but the fisherm an doesn't get anything except hard tim e. 7.2.9. Hunting Waves residents have a long history of waterfowl hunting; in the late 19th to early 20th century m en supplem ented their fishing incom e by market hunting for nor thern m arkets. W hen market hunting was outlawed upon the passing of th e Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, the era of hunting lodges began, and local m en were em ployed by wealthy Yankee sportsmen as guides. A village r noted tha t the oyster shoo t at Old Christm as, where m en dem onstra ted th eir skills as marksmen, was a carryover from the days when waterfowl hunting was a way of life. \"People were really quite good shots. They used to shoot geese and bag them off a nd send them off. Those people are long gone.\" \"Bag them off\" and \"send them off\" refers to the days of m arket- hunting when islanders m ade a good living co mmercial hunting; waterfowl was salted and packed f or shipping to n orthern m arkets such a s Baltim ore and New York. 7.2.10. Livestock and Gardening Once free-roam ing stock was prohibited on Ha tteras Island by state legislation in 1935, a villager kep t about fifty head of cattle in a si zeable pasture on the south en d of W aves. The 123 pasture extended from the present day post offi ce to Salvo, serving as a border between the communitie s. \"He had the cow pen, but he didn 't ow n the lan d,\" said a relative. \"I gu ess people let him use it.\" An old-tim er explained that they had to \"take all the old c ritters and pu t them in a pen because they were eating up all th e vegetation, causing ero sion real bad .\" We had a man that had the cow pen [between Salvo and W aves]. He would kill a beef , and sell it th rough the neighborhood here. I can rem ember him selling m om a piece o f beef. People in the n eighborhood also had hogs. My dad had hogs, and they would kill them , and he'd sm oke his own bacon and ham s. A village r pointed ou t that the cost o f keeping liv estock be came prohibitive f or island ers once they had to pen them up and fe ed them . There had been wild herds running here and the people used to kill a cow and divvy it up because there was no refrigeration or anythi ng so you had to use it imm ediately. In the early 20s wh en cars go t on the roads, they started having accidents with the life stock. The state passed a law that you had to pen up your livestock. So, penned, there was no way to feed them . So, they just killed them off. 7.2.11. Perceptions of E nvironment and Storms Bankers paid careful attention to the w eather, wind, and tides; it was im portant for fisherm en to judge the m ost auspicio us tim e for boating and h arvesting. A villager recalled his father studying the m oon and tides before he drove his car anywhere: \"If the m oon wa s about south or near south, it was about low tide. And to travel on the beach, it woul d be just as hard as it could be.\" A W aves native recalled the 1962 Ash W ednesday storm , as he was at the north end of the island w hen the sea broke th rough and swamped his car. He took refuge at the P ea Island lifesaving station un til the tide wen t down, and wade d hom e seven m iles. \"In thes e three villag es there wasn't any flooding except fo r a little bit in the ve ry north end of Rodanthe,\" he said. \"Up where the island convenience store is at now is about as far as the tide went down.\" 124 Bankers referred to the hard-packed sand at low tide as \"th e wash\"; this w as the preferable route before paved roads. The \"ba nk of beach\" referred to the sandy dry p ortion at high tid e. Fisherm en called the area where wate r forms a riptide and rushes offshore between shoals an \"outlet,\" and a gus t of wind was a \"flaw.\" 7.2.12. Significant Places Like m any islander s, families f rom Waves expr essed strong sentim ent toward buria l grounds and hom eplaces. Sm all grav eyards seem to be scattered everywhere but chu rch grounds. Church grav eyards were u nnecessary, as families b uried their o wn in their y ards or in small, fa mily-owned cem eteries. Marked and long-gone settlem ents, now federal parkla nd; theses graves range from a well-kept plot in the Salvo recreational area to an o vergrown plot at Little Kinnakeet; to unmarked and wash-away graves claim ed by sound erosion. Graveyards follow the general land use patterns of Banker' communities, com prising a patchwo juxtapos itions. D. Lance Midgett's father, for exam ple, is buried in a fa mily plot now juxtaposed to a campground along a chain link fence (Figure 7.2.6). His father had paid a very sm all sum to another villager for land that can hold about six graves. Althoug h the fam ily cem etery is becom ing som ething of tourist site, he visi ts the site regu larly. 125 Figure 7.2.6. D. Lance Midgett of W aves at Father's Grave. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. Some people still live in the house th ey were born in or, like Nellie Farro w's daughter Jackie W einberg, have moved back to their ch ildhood hom e. Islanders are proud of the portions of their homes that were constructed from the rem ains of shi pwrecks (Figure 7.2.7.): My grandfather bought this house in 1902 from his uncle. It's old - the lum ber isn't two- by-four but three-by-five or som ething, not dr essed. The floor joists are all different sizes, heavy lum ber. Probably cam e off a woode n ship. A piling off the back porch was a mast off a sailing ship that wrecked off Salvo. 126 Figure 7.2.7. Jackie W einberg and Mother Nellie Farrow of W aves. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. A villager k new of old trash piles th at ha ve been dug up, rev ealing hund reds of patent medicine bottles and kitchen item s. One such pile was in his backyard. A long-vanished landm ark that held fond m emories for W aves residents was the LST landing craft carrier, which broke from a tug in 1947 and wrecked. A resident's grandfather provided room and board for som e of the salv age workers, who in three months burned and scrapped the ship. Many recall when the vessel went down, and re member swimm ing and diving off it: \"I ev en have pictures of us,\" said a resi dent. \"I know it has to be o n a Sunday in dresses taking p ictures of each other on th is wrecked LST.\" 7.2.13. Rituals and Community E vents Waves' villagers have long been involved in Rodanthe's Old Christm as celebration and participated in a holiday exchange of sorts. \"People from Roda nthe m ight com e down here for 127 Christm as for the day and then for Old Christm as, people down here would go up there.\" In the early 1910s and 20s W aves' residents would join the procession where people would \"disguise\" and go from village to village, house to house, si nging and playing m usic. An elderly resident said that she quit going to the celebration becaus e of the brawls, but continued to spend the day in Rodanthe. \"You still ate with your friends . Nobody in W aves had anything special on Old Christm as, so I went up there.\" Other community even ts centered on religious or fa mily rites, such as funerals. Islanders recalled when the dead w ere shrouded and laid out in the parlor. Fam ily and friends \"sat up with the dead\" throughout the night. A villager confided that her fa ther was among the first to be embalmed, a process that took place at hom e in his bedroom . Before WWII the closest funeral home was in Manteo, but \"nobody was ever carried there.\" Weddings were not big celebr ations. It was not uncommon for couples to get m arried before a jus tice of the peace, and chu rch wedding s were sim ple affairs. A wom an recalled riding to her brother's wedding as a little girl on a horse and cart, but her parents stayed hom e. 7.2.14. National Park S ervice Village rs ha ve rom antic m emories of pre-Nationa l Seashore d ays of freedom when \"people cou ld go to the b each anywh ere - th ey had the full run of everything, then, as did the cattle.\" But at the sam e time they are quick to point out that the Na tional Park Service has helped prev ent ram pant developm ent of beach homes all alo ng the is land beaches that is occurring within village borders. A few Bankers recalled the transition peri od and m eetings between community m embers and park officials. \"Everybody was dead set agains t the Park Servi ce,\" a villager said, describing 128 \"heated argu ments\" at meeting s in th e Rodanthe Community building and Manteo. H e reflected that people were suspicious of the governm ent and frightened of the \"unknown.\" He recalled that people were upset with the property transfer and the price th ey were offered for their land. But, he scan ned the hor izon and the severa l new homes being built and sa id, \"The only thing I 'm sorry of is that they didn't take m ore.\" 7.2.15. Coast Guard and the Military The closest Lifesaving/Coast Guar d station to Waves was the Gull Shoal Station south of Salvo and the Chicam acom ico Station in Rodanthe . The business of saving lives was the first formal occupation f or many Chicamacom ico families. A W aves' r esident pointed o ut that before the life saving stations were esta blished villagers were \"fisherm en or whatever they could find to do.\" His grandfather was stationed at one of th e life saving stations, a nd his father carried on that trad ition by joining the Coast G uard. Most families can recount an impressive g enealogy of ancesto rs an d rela tives that serv ed in this c apacity. Many ferry workers were once mem bers of the Coast G uard as well, and alm ost everyone comme rcial fished at one tim e or another. \"That was about it. Coast Guard and fishing was about it - or you went off som ewhere and got a job.\" \"The Coast Guard is a very big part of our lives,\" agreed a neighbor. The Coast Guard was not only a significant source of employm ent, but served to help villagers in everyday ways as well. \"A ny problem s, we didn't call for a sher iff - the only sheriff's office was in Manteo so all we had w as the Coas t Guard.\" Because so many Hatteras Islanders served in the C oast Guard, the stations had som ewhat of a warm , family- like atmosphere tow ard islande rs trave ling and stoppin g in. The stations were fa mous fo r their abund ant m eals and willingn ess to feed islanders who were stuck in the sand or trapped in a storm . 129 My dad built a thirty-tw o foot shrimp boat. So everyone says, well how are you going to get that boat to the water? He said don't worry about it, I'll get it to the water. So he called the C oast Guard and they m oved that boat - dug right down and pulled it to the water with an am phibious duck, a World W ar II boat on wheels. The Coast Guard sent out regular beach patrols in search of ships in trouble, and this too was beneficial to villagers w ho found them selves st randed on isolated stretches of sand. \"One guy would be com ing from one station, the other from the other station and they would m eet. If you broke down and started walking it wouldn't be to o long before you m et som eone on pa trol.\" 7.2.16. Modernity and Perceptions of Change Several residents of W aves not ed that people's sense of tim e has changed greatly in the past few decades, as well as a sense of res ponsibility toward others. \"People are busier,\" complained a resid ent. \"You don't have tim e for each other. I can ask p eople about their relatives and they don't know anything. They haven' t seen them in days.\" Lost is the luxury of \"visiting.\" There isn't any community anym ore. Use to, everybody went and visited everybody else. That was the big highlight, the visiting. No w nobody visits anym ore. In fact you don't even know your next-door neighbor. A wom an pointed out that there were fewer houses in the past, \"so in a day's tim e you probably could go in every house for a pop visit at least. People don't have that tim e now.\" Ironically, the convenience of the paved highway and bridge has made it too easy for people to drive off-island to meet their needs, rather than depend on one another. I spend all my tim e in the car. If I want a nything I'm usually up the beach or in Manteo to get it, and som etimes I go three o r four tim es a week which takes a lot of tim e. You didn't do that when you had to catch a ferry. The sheer growth in numbers of people was cited as one of the biggest changes facing Chicam acom ico. A villager observed that there had been a \"sem i-buildin g boom \" in the 1980s, 130 and then th e water plant was built in 1995; the trans ition to \"city water\" is viewed by ts critical \"tipping point\" toward accelerated hous ing developm ent. One villager cited 2001 as the start of the \"biggest boom of all\" in ne w housing and developm ents, speculating that the post-September 11, 2001 econom y was key, with inve stors skittish about the lack luster stock market and therefore putting thei r capital in the \"sur e-thing\" property and housing m arket. Low mortgage rates contributed to this trend, as did soaring property va lues and new building policies. For exam ple, people had been require d to have at least 20,000 feet of land to build when they were on a well system , but the lo t-size requirem ent was recen tly reduced, allowing for denser developm ent. A fisherm an reflected on the is land's appare nt prosperity and the chance of future controls on developm ent. \"The m oney is what m akes things go. Most of the growth is outside developers com ing in.\" He adde d that developers \"could care le ss about the island. All they are interested in is m oney, build it and go.\" 131 7.3. Salvo 7.3.1. Name, Place, and Features Salvo, originally \"Clarks\" or \"Clarksville,\" is the southe rnmost village of northern Chicam acom ents (Figure 7.3.1). A Union ship comm ander is reported to have spotted the settlem ent from sea while headi ng north, and asked his crew for the nam e of the village. Checking the chart, the crew found none. The captain ordered his m en to \"give it a salvo anyway,\" which is a sim ultaneous firing of cannons. One of the crewm en wrote \"salvo\" on the chart, and this was noted by others and used on later m aps. The postal service simply chose the nam e Salvo from maps when the o ffice was established in 1901 (Payne 1985, 164). Figure 7.3.1. Satellite Im age of Salvo. Source: NC Division of Marine F isheries. There were nine fam ilies that p resent-day resi dents of Salvo consider to be their founding members: the Cyrus Gray, Abram Hooper, Ez ekiel Hooper, Lorenzo , ilies (Salvo Volu nteer F ent Ladies Auxiliary 2002). W illiam Wellington Hooper was 132 known for telling h is grandchild ren that he ha d washed ashore in a barrel. He, like many Hatteras Islanders, was a Union sympathizer, and fought for the north during the Civil W ar (ibid). Salvo, five feet above sea level, had a population of 77 in 1910; by 1940, it had a population of 98 people (Dunbar 1956). In the mid-1950s geographer Gary Dunbar predicted that the population would level off at 100, and dubbed Salvo \"a fishing village, with little cause for tourists to stop\" (ibid, 175). These predictio ns have proven off-the-m ark, as m ore residents earn their living from tourism than from fishi ng, and the proliferation of \"m ini-hotel\" beach homes have caused the population to increase co nsiderably (F igures 7.3.2- 3.). Although village- specific population figures are not offered, the 2000 Census listed 482 living units in Salvo, underscoring the growth of the vill age (Dare County Land Use Plan 2002). Figure 7.3.2. New Be achfront \"R ental Machine\" in Salvo. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. 133 Figure 7.3.3. Developm ent on the South Edge of Salvo. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. As with W aves and Rodanthe, it is hard to detect a core v illage am id the towering r ental houses, gift shops, cam pgrounds, and convenience stores. Upon closer inspection, however, modest homes are here and there along Highway 12, as well as one of the sm allest post offices in the country. Few natives live near th e ocean beach, following trad itional patterns of keeping away from the m oody se a. According to Burt Hooper, Salvo was hom e to 15 houses in 1944, owned by Hoopers, Grays, Paynes, and Midgetts. Shipwrecks have been incorporated into the neighborhood, as residents ha ve long salvaged lumber and other parts of ships and used them in house construction. Lon g gone are f ences betw een each hou se bridged b y four-step stiles, designed to let people pass from yard to yard while keeping livestock out. Well water tasted bad in the Chicam acom ico region. Before electricity, water was extracted by a hand pump or gathered with a cistern. 134 135We used to have an old hand pump, and you bro ught in a pail of water, and there was a ladle sitting in a white porcelain bucket. Ev erybody drank out of the same dipper. If one person got a cold, everybody got the cold. A villager noted that water \"purified itself every seven days,\" and improved in taste depending on the season. Water in the month of May \"rots or stinks,\" so households had to \"have the gutter unhooked\" so the diverted water would run into the yard instead of the cistern where the drinking water was stored. Water collected in a tank would get a shot of ch lorine bleach to keep mosquito larvae or \"wigglers\" out. A hard-packed area in Salvo known as Bl ack Bottom had little ve getation; local legend has it that too much blood was spilled during the Civil War, renderi ng it barren (Payne 1985) (Map 7.3). Before World War II Chicamacomico re sidents held automobile races there, until the 1944 storm covered it in sand and a llowed vegetation to grow. An important landmark in Salvo juts out of the Atlantic waters and is within swimming distance of shore: th e propeller shaft of the Old Richmond , a 19 th century steam vessel or side- wheeler that some locals believe burned offshor e and littered the beach with bodies during the Civil War. An illustration of wreck graces the cover of the Salvo Volunteer Fire Department cookbook. Map 7.3. Salvo Village with Hi storical Sites (not to scale). Sketch by B. Garrity-Blake. 136 7.3.2. Relation to Other Villages and Beyond Whereas Rodanthe and Waves were interc onnected, m any viewed Salvo as the \"odd one out\" in Chicam acom ico, with a reputation for be ing m ore clannish and independent than the others. Village riv alries existed and were so metimes settled during Old Christm as brawls, yet it is clear that Salvo was part of a gre ater co mmunity. A village r stressed th at families a nd communitie s relied on e ach othe r too much for any riva lries to be taken s erious ly: Everybody depended on each other. If you had to put a roof on your house, everybod y just com e helped you put it on. Every Saturd ay they would pull th em sailboats out and helped each other turn them bottom up, clean the bottom and they would take all their nets up and lim e them, and lim e the sails. Get them all snow white and clean. Mutual-depe ndency was a surviva l skill for isla nders in a ll asp ects of every day lif e, and particularly in tim es of em ergency. A village r recalled how neighbors wo uld rally to prevent a fire from spreading years before the S alvo Vol unteer Fire Departm ent was established in 1965: One house close to the road here caught fi re and people would pour water onto the bed quilts and p ut it on the roof to try an d save surro unding hous es, it was th at hot. Everybody in the neighborhood was fighting it. The Coast Guard from Rodanthe cam e down to help too. That's all we could do was tote water. Everybody's pum ps around here was dry. The history of the fire departm ents in the Chicam acom ico region underscores a certain divide between Salvo and the two villages to the north. Initially there was one fire departm ent, the Chicam acom ico Vol untary Fire Departm ent (VFD), but then Salvo broke away. We all started out together, then we never seem to get along together. Half the guys wanting to d o this and h alf that. So a ll the men in Salvo and a few of the m up there, they said well we'll build our own. So we nt and got us a franchise and built our own. Despite the som ewhat rocky history betw een the Chicam acom ico and Salvo VFD's, members stressed that all the vo lunteers train together, assist one another, and are friends. \"W e built a whole sta tion with f ish fries,\" a member of the Ladies Auxilia ry po inted ou t. They held the event each Easter and Labor Day weekend, catering to tourists. For $25 dollars they 137 purchased a fire truck, and had the property for the station dona ted. The wom en held the fish fries and raffles annually until the d epartm ent bega n receiving tax rev enue. Like the wom en who cooked for Old Christm as in Rodanthe, the auxi liary wom en had particular cooking tasks and talents. \"I'd take the potatoes and divide them up, and the wom en would peel, dice, and boil them . Jean would m ix potato salad, and we all shredded the cabbage. We had to figure up for 500 people how m any hushpuppies it would take.\" Men volunteered to fry the trout or bluefish. Salvo res idents shar e with other islan ders a deep love f or their hom e communities an d culture. A m an who left the island to work at a shipyard in Mann's Harbor for over 35 years stressed that he frequently returned throughout his life. \"I never really co nsidered that place m y home; always thought of Salvo as hom e.\" 7.3.3 . School Although Salvo once had its own schoolhous e, it was closed in the 1930s upon consolid ation of the thre e Chicam acom ico communities. A n old-tim er recalled atten ding the Rodanthe School when there was on e teach er for a ll the grad es. A m an explained that he was the school bus driver for Rodanthe School in the 1940s when he graduated from 10th grade at age 16. \"I drove six months without a ny driver's license,\" he laughe d, underscoring how inform ally things were done on Hatteras Island: I was sixteen. They didn't have any highway down here so you didn't have a driver's license and you didn't have any license on your car really. Th ey called us to Manteo for a bus training session. I drove all up and down them roads and [the official] said, you've done a lot of driving! I said yes m a'am quite a bit. She said \"Let m e have your driver's license so I can put the num ber on you bus license.\" I sai d, Lady, I don't have a driver's license. She about fainted. So she gave m e papers and m y dad and signed them so I could get a driver's license. 138 He drove the school bus for four years, m ainly along the interior sandy ro ads. \"W e took the dual wheels off of it,\" he reco llected. \"We cut th e governor off the engine so it would have m ore power. W e turned som e of the pressure dow n in the tires so it would go in the sand.\" When the Chicam acom ico schools consolidated in the 1930s, it likely eased rivalries between villages and dim inished any aura of cla nnishness. Yet, distinctions rem ained. Bankers claim ed to detect a dialect difference between Sa lvo, W aves, and Rodanthe, even to this day, as well as the other villages. Alt hough specific examples were lacki ng, they said that they could tell where a person was from by the way they talked. Even after consolidation to one Chicam acomico school, classes were tiny. A Salvo villager proudly proclaim ed that he was one of the last graduating clas ses of Rodanthe School before the \"big\" consolidation of all island schoo ls; in 1950 he was valedictorian in a class of seven. 7.3.4. Church A prim ary feature distinguishing the vill age of Salvo from neighboring W aves and Rodanthe is church. W hereas W aves and Rodanthe share a Methodist chur ch, Salvo has its own, Clarks Bethel. Established in 1886 as \"Clarks B ethel Episcopa l South,\" the nam e was changed to \"Clarks Bethel\" in 1892. It was destroyed in the 1944 storm but rebuilt the following year. Salvo also has a Pentecostal Assem bly of G od church whose congreg ation was originally Methodist. Myrtle Chambers of Elizabeth City began the A ssem bly of God faith on the Banks; she and her husband Charles Cham bers first intr oduced the f ervent style of worshiping in Avon after holding a tent revival on the beach. Th ey began the Glad Tidings Gospel Tabernacle church in 19 27. The congregation met in peop les' hom es until a church was built in 1 935 by the 139 members them selves, including the preacher, fro m timbers of the G.A. Kohler shipwreck of 1933. The first service was held October 6, 193 5. The new church was called \"The Little Church with the Big God,\" and later changed to \"Salvo Assembly of God.\" Salvo resident Lucy Hooper help ed build the church and preached to the congreg ation un til her death in 1 975. Hooper also fished h er own nets, built h er own house a nd boat, and ran a sweet sh op (Salvo Volunteer Fire Departm ent Ladies Auxiliary 2 002). Miss Cham bers cam e in with her tent and had this revival. It all ha d to be Methodist who were going to it bec ause that's all the y were. She led them a little dif ferently. Methodists were not lively in their worship, and that was the beginning of the Assembly churches here. She split the [Methodist] c hurch in Avon. The sam e thing happened at Salvo but she didn't get anybody from Rodanthe. \"The original charter of th e Methodist church,\" explaine d a m ember, \"was used as a guide to draw out the charter fo r the Assem bly of God.\" Member s attended the Salvo Assem bly of God as much as three days a week . A m an raised in th e church desc ribed the Assembly doctrine as very strict, \"You do this or do that an d you go straight to hell.\" But others pointed out that the church was not as strict as it used to be. They're all more liberal than what they us ed to be. You don't hear m any of the old- fashioned fire and brim stone serm ons like you us ed to. It's love, love, love, love, love, now. Let me tell you, God is love, that's a verse in the Bible, but he's also God of judgm ent. He's our m ediator now , but he'll be our judge later. A wom an raised in the Methodi st church but m arried into the Pentecostal described the different style of worship: \"[ The Methodists] don't want you to talk in tongues, and they don't like clapping your hands, and such stuff as th at,\" while the A ssem bly of God congregation rejoiced in a m ore effervescent m anner. \"I b elieve in the wor ship tha t they have in th e Assem bly,\" she explained. \"But, [speaking in tongues] will never get yo u in Heaven. \" She tapped her heart and added, \"It's wh at's here, and your belief and th e love of God that's going to get you there.\" 140 People in C hicam acom ico attended each othe r's churches, ho wever, no matter what th e denom ination, as church events such as reviv als presented an opportunity for villag ers to socia lize. A n Assem bly member rec alled wa lking to the Fair Haven Me thodist church between Waves and Rodanthe to attend revivals. \"Ga ng of young people would get together and walk up there.\" Today, in 2004, churches from the norther n region of the island to Avon share an event called \"the S ingspiration,\" in which m embers from the various Methodist and Assem bly churches gather to sing praise to God and soci alize with one another, thus crosscutting both denom inational and com munity boundaries. 7.3.5. Stores Mr. Aaron Hooper had a store in Salvo dur ing the 1920s and 30s. It was a gathering place for villagers on Su nday afterno on; adults would chat w hile ch ildren played in m assive, gnarled oak trees. The store wa s \"a little building m aybe 15, 18 f eet wide by 25 foot long and it stored som e can goods and stuff...no refriger ation.\" The sm all stores acted as store houses . Rather than staying open for people to com e and go, people would notify the storekeeper when they needed som ething. When fa milies purchas ed staples in large sacks, the sacks were washed, taken apart, cut, and sew n into dresses and underwear. \"They would sew with foot-operated machines. It was a very self-sufficient type of ex isten ce.\" Walter Hooper had a store before World W ar II, as did Lucy Hooper. \"Aunt Lucy\" Hooper personified the self-reliant nature of the Outer Banker. She helped build the Assem bly of God church and becam e preacher of it. She built h er own house and b oat, as well as a sm all store in Salv o. A villager recalled seeing M ac M idgett's fath er, who ran a fish house in Rodanthe, bring baby Mac in Aunt L ucy's store, \"lay him up on the scales and punch a hole in a 141 can of m ilk and give it to him to drink.\" Aunt Lucy added a wing to the store called the \"Sweet Shop,\" serving hom emade ice cream and candy. Bankers recalled food rationing during W orld War II. \"You got a half a stick of butter and som etimes a stick of butter according to how m any was in your family. Fam ily of five or six would get a whole stick. Mam a would seal [the butter] in a jar, put a rope around it, and put it down into th e well to k eep it coo l.\" Village rs co nsum ed much f ish and f owl, includ ing shorebirds that were prepared with pie bread. Collards with cornm eal dumplings were a regular fare as well. 7.3.6. Pastimes and Childhood Activities Some villag ers rem ember a ch ildho od to do, while othe rs reco gnize th e rare freedom they had growing up on a sandy bank. \" We had som ething here as children that probably very few places in the world have,\" sa id an islander. \"W e had total and abso lute freedom because the island was m ore or less sealed off from the outside world.\" He pointed out that they had \"no roads, no electricity, none of the am enities. \" Parents h ad peace of m ind as \"there were no strangers to be c oncerned with about your children.\" This islander also recalled how, as a child, he roamed about the woods a nd water, and would \"run for the m arsh, chase anim als and run under creeks. Our parents just ne ver worried where we were and what we were doing.\" Leslie Hooper and Gaskill Austin claim ed to be som e of the first surf ers to ride the waves off Hatteras Island, before surfing becam e a popular sport in the 1950s. The Salvo boys collected old planks -\"dunnage\"- that washed as hore, and used them as m akeshift surfboards. Austin rec alled: 142 One day, I got too far out on a wave and curl ed, and the board dipped in the sand, rode me up over it and I s lid off. A piece of the board split off the size of m y finger went u p through m y armpit and cam e out through the back of m y shoul der. I got stabbed good. My uncle held m e down and put his f oot on m y shoulder and arm and yanked the thing out, and I w ent back in the ocean in the salt water and soaked in the s alt water. Then I came hom e and hid [the wound] for a week or two until it h ealed up. During W orld War II, Salvo children sat on the roofs of houses to watch ships and subm arines burn in flames. They would regularl y patrol the beach, finding lum ber, bananas, and other su rprises. A village w oman stress ed that she was raised in a str ict ho usehold. \"If I went to a little girl's house to play, I was only allowed one hour . When that hour was up I knew to be hom e on time, and I had to leave...in tim e enough to be hom e when that clock struck that hour.\" She recalled spending m any hour s helping her m other with household chores: Mam a got up real early in the m ornings and boiled our clothes, washed them in an old pot. Rinse them real good and get them on the line, and then she would clean the house, and as I growed older I had to help sweep a nd scrub the floors and take clothes in, fold them up. I was very young when I learned to iron, and I stoo d on a little wooden box. We didn't have no sink to the table to wash the dishes. Youth would get together and m ake \"pull candy .\" \"It is m ade with sugar and vinegar, and you boil it and then you have to take lard or grease on your hands so it won't burn you, and pull it until it gets stiff and then you break it o ff in little taffy pieces. \" Teenagers were allowed to have bonfires and clambakes on the beach, an d dance parties at the o ld school house. The Comm unity Recreation building, fashione d out of a section of som eone's house, was a popular destination for Salvo children duri ng the 1940s. The clubhouse was established by a couple of co mmunity m embers to giv e youth a place to em broider, p lay checkers, b all and jacks- \"bob jacks\"- and other games. Villagers of Salvo, lik e those in oth er Cape Hatteras comm unities, refrain ed from 143 working on Sunday; Sunday m eals were prepared Sa turday, nets and boats were cleaned and set onshore, and the Lord's Day was reserved for church, visiting and relaxing. 7.3.7. Medical Care A resident recalled gro wing up with his grand mother, a m idwife. He used to \"travel around sometim es from house-to-house with her wh en children were born and stand by while she was helping with the b irth. I had to s it down and shut up and stay th ere un til sh e finished.\" One of the m idwives in Salvo was Patty Hooper. In the 1930s and 40s, old-tim ers recall onl y one doctor serving the whole island, so islanders depended largely on hom e remedies: Dr. Kenfield was his nam e. That was the only doctor on the whole beach . You just didn't go to doctors them days for every l ittle cold. Your pe ople doctored you up, old home remedies. If you had the flu they used to give you a dose of castor oil. That would grind your stom ach like a grindstone, then they would give you a dose of Epsom salts to clean that out of you. For em ergencies, such as when the Assem bly of God preacher was burne d in a stov e fire while cooking, an air-ambulance landed in the Waves cow pen and flew the patient to Norfolk. A villager recounted th e trag ic story of her deaf and m ute sister who drowned in the so und on Mother's Day at age five. The girl had been born with disabilities, but was stru ck with an illness. \"Th ere weren 't doctors he re and m om had to tak e her to Elizabe th City, and the doctors then weren't up to date to what they would be today, and they claim ed her tonsils had poisoned her.\" She sh ared ano ther tragic even t that illu strates the ro le of family and church in h elping with not only physical ailm ents but m ental or em otional crises as well. Her daughter was hit by a car and k illed at age five. I just wen t haywire and I never com e out of it 'til the day th ey buried he r. I was half way wacky, I couldn't even get m y own clothes on; my m om had to com e in and help bathe 144 me. But, you know, down through life I feel like a lot of times that God lets us go down in the valley, and som etimes real deep, but I f eel like He's always there to pull us back up on the m ountain. 7.3.8. Early Transportation In 1950, \"the highway was just to the north e nd of Rodanthe and the rest of it was sand trails. They were still running the w ooden ferry\" with a four car capacity. Les Hooper recalled hauling tar f or the final stretch of road from Rodanthe to Oregon Inlet. He was working with Toby Tillet on \"one of those old wooden ferries \" and carried a \"big old tank\" full of tar. \"They would pum p it in trucks on this side.\" The work crew \"jus t put the tar down on the sand and ground it up with a m achine. In hot weather if you stopped y our car on it you would just sink right down and get stuck.\" 7.3.9. Postal Service Clarks received its first post office in 1901 under postm aster Kenneth R. Pugh; for unknown reasons, Pugh requested the nam e \"Phlox\" for the village, but this was rejected in favor of \"Salvo\" (Crum bley and Ertzberger 1988). P ugh worked out of a tiny building located near the landing where the m ail boat unloaded its letters and parcels. The building was m oved up on the road toward the south en d of the village when Melvina W hedbee becam inal person b orn in Salvo \"-and still alive as of 2004- worked at the Salvo post office for almost 50 y ears, the latter years as pos tmas ter. Th e post office becam e decomm issioned after catching on fire in 1992 and the eight-by-twelve fo ot building was m oved to Hooper's front yard (F igure 7.3.4). 145 Figur e 7.3.4. W illiam and Edward Hooper, Old Salvo Post Office. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. \"People still com e by wanting to m ail a letter ,\" reported Edward Hooper. \"Som e of them sticks letters under the d oor.\" In 198 8 the Sal vo post office tied for first p lace in the \"Sm allest Post Office Challenge,\" a contest sponsor ed by the Oakland Division Communications Departm ent of California. The interior of the post office was such that custom ers could only see the postal w orker's m idriff through a slat. \"I'd talk to them and they'd say, 'yes m a'am, yes ma'am',\" laughed Edward Hooper. \"And, when I got done I'd com e around to the door - som e 146 of them had the funniest look on their face! They didn't know [that I was a m an].\" He recounted a tale where one wom an teased hi m about the sm all size of the building: A wom an com e up to that little hole and she looks and says \"Is this a bathroom ?\" \"No ma'am, lady. This is the post office.\" She di d the sam e thing again. She says, \"Is this really a bathroom ?\" I say, \"N o ma'am lady this is the post of fice.\" W ell the th ird time she rub m e the wrong way. She was just m aking fun. I said, \"Lady, you see all these bushes out round the back of this post office? If you need to go to the bathroom , you help yourself. That's where I go!\" S he didn't have to use the bathroom anym ore. 7.3.10. Commercial Fishing Comm ercial fishing was very m uch a fam ily activity; not only did wom en participate in net hanging and so on, but children o ften accom panied th eir father, un cle, or grandfather on fishing trips. These outings were not nece ssarily enjoyable for youngs ters. A m an recalled fishing with his grandf ather at the ag e of ten: \"We would go to the sou nd at nigh t and fish until two o'clock in the m orning with the other boats, com e hom e and sleep a couple of hours and go to school. If you didn't work, you didn't eat.\" H e expressed frustration at a few relatives who would wait on shore to say, \"Oh boy, there's some pr etty fish you got there, I sure would like a mess of them,\" yet neglect to go fishing them selves. He went night fishing for m ullet in the s ound. Fishing grounds generally extended south to Gull Shoal Island half way to Avon, and then nor th to the inlet. On ce mullet was spotted, two boats would encircle the school a nd \"close in on them .\" The fish would jump \"over the net like sheep, but you had to get overboard then and cat ch them individually, the big m ullets. W rap them up in a net and th row them in the boat because they didn't get gilled.\" A village r describ ed han d lining f or red drum : You would have a run in April when the fish went north and the October run when they came back south, that was the b ig one. W e would get on the beach and w e didn't hav e 147 fishing rods. W e used hand lines. It was th e precursor of the spinning reel. You used a big coil of line on your h and and you threw it in the ocean an d let it run o ff your hand. The wom en would cook and can the inch and half cubes of drum , preserving a supply for the winter m onths. \"W e would call it \"p ick fish.\" T hey'd tak e it out and f inish boiling it, put it on a plate and you'd break it up. Mix onions, m eat cracklings and sprinkle those on it. It was quite a tasty dish.\" During shad season sm oked shad would be hung in people's yards. \"It was like butterfly wings - you hang those over the clothesline and let them air dry.\" Herring was salted and layered in b arrels as well. The occas ional s ea turtle m ade its way to village kitch ens, where people clean ed and stew ed the m eat or had \"pick -up turtle,\" m eaning that everyone would gather around to pick the m eat off the bones and eat it. Old-tim ers recall when oysters were a bundant in Pa mlico Sound directly o ff Chicam acom ico, but now fisherm en have to travel far to find healthy oyster beds. \"I could go down the shore and get a bushel of oysters anytim e I wanted. Now, you can't find a shell where they used to be.\" Net m esh was known as \"m arsh,\" and childre n were expected to assist the m en and wom en in tying nets. \"That was something that everyone did, children and adults. You learned to tie nets w hen you were very sm all. Any fr ee tim e that's what you did, sit on the porches - there would be a half dozen people tying ne t while we were talking\" (Figure 7.3.5). 148 Figure 7.3.5. Hand Carved Net Hook and Gauge. Photo by Jennifer Miller. The Banker \"Jack of all trad e\" tradition where men fished opportunistically has becom e difficult in the m odern world of licenses, restrict ions, and shrinking freedom s. \"I worked for the state, although I had nets and stuff I used to set, \" said a v illager who lacked a comm ercial fish ing license and, therefore, could not sell his catch. \"I ne ver thought that there would be the day when I couldn't set a net and get me a mess of fi sh. W hat woul d it hurt?\" He calculated that \"there's not a half a dozen fisherm en in these three neighborhoods now.\" Luther Gray built a fish house in th e sound at the Mail Boat lead, but it was destroy ed in the 1933 storm . Shortly afterwards the Civilian Conservation Corps came in and dug several canals on the sound side, enabling Garland Hooper to build a fi sh house in Salvo. Today, in 2004, there are no fish houses in the northern banks region. 7.3.11. Hunting Men hunted duck and goose in Pam lico Sound as well as alon g the ocean beaches. According to a resident, islander s went to the beaches during nes ting s eason to f ollow sea tur tles 149 to the ir nes ting spot to c ollect eggs u ntil just af ter World W ar II. A village r expla ined that his favorite sport was duck hunting, but he had not pa rticipated in this activity for 15 years: It's becom e too expensive. It's a rich m an's sport, really. And, there's so m any restrictions. You can't go here and you can't go there, and you can't do this and you can't do that. A for mer hunting guide desc ribed the Gull Island hunting cl ub located south of Salvo. The club was com prised of six m en, from Knoxv ille, TN, Norfolk, VA, and Atlanta, G A who owned a clubhouse on Gull Island in the sound. They hunted \"geese, diving ducks, and puddle ducks\" and used sink boxes and blinds. A wom an in Salvo dressed the fowl, and the ducks were shipped to K noxville for the Kern's B akery annual com pany party. The gu ide's hom eplace was fashioned from the rem ains of the clubhouse dest royed in the 1944 storm . A smaller hunt club run by Guthrie M idgett was located at Clark s Bay just south of Salvo; it too was destroyed by storm . 7.3.12. Livestock and Gardening Salvo m en undertook twice-a nnual cattle roundups. \"W hen I was young, there was cattle and horses just roam ing around everywhere, like the old west,\" recalled an old-tim er. \"The old guys used to round the cattle up all the way from Avon. They would bring them to the pound to mark the cows and bran d the colts.\" The brands or ear-notch patterns were registered in Manteo to prove ow nership. From 1921 to 1926 the cattle had to be driven every few weeks to the village-dipping vat, located near what is now the Salvo Cam pground. Herds of free ranging cattle were g one by the late 1930s, as wa s the practice of \"k illing a beef.\" 150 7.3.13 . Perceptions of E nvironment and Storms Outer Bankers are know n for their attentiveness to clim ate, weather patterns, changes in wind, tide, water tem perature, and fish behavior. Before radar and m odern weather tracking, and even before the earlier w eathe r stations of Hatteras and Ocra coke, villagers depended on their own observations to judg e what the w eather was going to do. A m an recalled his g randfather, a fisherm an, standing ou tside for a half hour each ev ening to study the weather to decid e if and where he'd fish the following day. \"It was a dail y routine for him and he was very good at it. He would study the skies, wind direction, and everyt hing else. He could pretty m uch predict the weather just as well as th e weather stations do nowadays.\" Villagers po int out that, despite their long hist ory of violent and devastating storm s, there is no record of anyone dying in a hurricane. They are proud of th eir ancestors' abilities to ride out storm s, and the fact that they inherited thes e survival skills. Many sh ake their heads at th e \"fuss\" that is m ade in modern tim es, with mass evacuations, the boarding of windows, and post- storm visits by helicopters, FEMA team s, insurance adjus ters, and reporters. They concede, however, th at life is m ore com plicated today and much of the fuss is neces sary. Today island ers have carpeted hom es, whereas hi storically houses had wooden floor s that m ade it easier to sweep post-storm sand and m ud out. Fewer people had cars and other possessions to worry about. \"You didn't have electricity, worry ing about your food is going to s poil. The electric is off, when are you going to get it back, and when can we get out on the roads?\" Bankers are acutely at tuned to their natural surroundings , particularly those who spent time on the water. A hunting guide explained that he could tell where he is in Pam lico Sound on foggy days by the depth of the water and feel of the bottom : Just tak e a paddle and tell because this is grass, lo ng, grassy b ottom. This is m uddy bottom . This is sandy bottom when you leave the harbor here, you got grassy bottom out 151 through here. But just as soon as you get down here to No Ache Shoal you run on white sandy bottom, and if you're going' to Gull Shoa l, and you run into this, this is Cedar Hammock Channel. It's muddy, and when you run to Gull Shoal Channel, it's deeper. And it's also m uddy too, but it's deep er than Cedar Hammock Channel. He knew the chances of catch ing fis h in various places by w hich way the wind was blowing: If the wind is off to the east'ard, this is a good place to fish. If the wind's off to the north'ard, d own inside the reef is th e best place to fish. And if the wind's off the west'ard, then you fish on this side of the ch annel, over next to Bay Shoal. You always fish on the lee side of the channel. That's where the fish co ngregates at. 7.3.14. Significant Places A village r cited the Or egon Inle t Coast Guard st ation as an importan t plac e to him , one that he has unsuccessfully tried to get preserved. That is very special because that was the poi nt [before crossing Oregon Inlet to Manteo]. It was past the arduous part of the journey. Most of the crew was fa mily and friends. Whoever was on duty in the lookout tower woul d wave you in and we'd stop and have a meal with them , so I'm very f amiliar with th e station and spen t a whole lo t of time there. The Salvo Day Use Area on the south end of the village is important to many people as well. \"That was the m ost popular campground anyw here on the island,\" said a villager. \"W as full to over-flowing m ost of the tim e, especia lly on weekends. They had a public beach over there and lif eguards.\" H e explained that the National Park Se rvice wa s losing m oney so they shut down the cam pground and turned it into a day ar ea. On the site is an old cem etery, and in sound water next to the graveyard early baptism s and revivals took place (Figure 7.3.6). \"I can remember this heavy wom an with a dress bei ng dipped in and she cam e up with her dress all clinging to her and I didn't thi nk that looked too good. But I was a little child then. W ithin the last couple o f years, two little children in our ch urch have op ted to be bap tized in the ocean, and another in the sound.\" 152 Figure 7.3.6. Salvo Day Use Area Grave. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. As is common throughout Hatteras and Ocracoke , villagers are extrem ely attached to the burial sites of their loved ones and ancestors. A Sa lvo resident recently died of cancer. His wife had him buried in their backyard, establishing a ne w family burial plot. S ix months later she had her daughter's grave m oved from its highway -side location to the new backyard plot. The tiny creeks along the sound are significant to fisherm en, including an area where a new developm ent was going up. \"I spent a lot of happy hours up there in them creeks, hunting and fishing,\" said a Salvo m an. He sailed about in a 16-foot skiff, catching fish and crabs. His 153 154favorite area was called Jenkins Island and No Ache Island, because \"that's where I lived. Everyday I went down there fishing or hunting. \" He knew the names of the creeks, and lamented that the younger generation would not bother to learn the old names like Brick Creek, Opening Creek, Horse Wading Creek, Crooked Cree k, and Ben Peters Creek. \"I'm the last generation that's going to know [the names of creeks]. The generation that is growing up now, they don't hunt, they don't fish. They could care less what the name of a creek is.\" \"From straight Highway 12, it doesn't appear that there would be so many creeks off Salvo,\" a fisherman pointed out. He could not recall the stories behind some of the names, but did recall a few. One landing was called Percy's net rack. \"He was a ma n that lived to Avon. He cut everybody's hair years ago for a dollar a head. But he used to fish up around Gull Shoal and he had a net rack that he put there, and that 's why they called it Pe rcy's but a lot of people called it the snake pit, 'cause there was a lot of snakes in the summertime.\" He pointed out Kannigy's Pond, drained so that \"t hey could get the turtles out of it,\" and a point called \"A Man's Grave\" where somebody was buried. Another interesting name \"Hen Turd's Creek\" and \"Cross Shoal,\" where Coast Guardsmen used meet and \"clock in\" with one another on patrol: The Coast Guard used to have a little house here on the beach that was called the Cross House. That's where they met from Avon a nd Gull Shoal, to check their clocks, and the guy from Gull Shoal had a key for the clock th at was in Little Kinnakeet, and the guy from Little Kinnakeet had a key for the clock for Gull Shoal. Gull Shoal men had the key to Rodanthe clock, and Rodanthe had the ke y to Gull Shoal clock, and that's how they would strike them, and that's how they knew that they met. He attributed his knowledge of the old creek na mes from \"growing up in the sailing days\" and a childhood of exploration. \"They we re all sailboats. Later on as I got up to 15 or 16, they started getting little Briggs and Stratt on engines in their boats. When I got in my 20s they started buying outboards.\" \"No Ache Point\" and \"No Ache Island\" is humorous rejoinder to \"Pains Creek\" and \"Pains Bay\" across the sound on th e mainland, although early m aps list N o Ache Point as \"No Egg Point.\" \"No Egg Point was im portan t as a descrip tive place nam e because egg gathering from wild bird nests was an im porta nt activity supplem enting the diet of early Bankers\" (P ayne 1985, 134) (see Maps 8.9.2 through 4 in Chapter 8). Pre-1920s skiffs were about 18 feet long and four and a half foot wide, with hom e-sewn canvas sails and a jib. \"They'd bui ld them theirself. They'd just set up a place and buy the juniper and build them a boat.\" Villagers sailed the skiffs \"to Avon to a fellowship m eeting,\" on fishing trips, visits, and up and down the sound shore with its myriad of creeks, points, and islands. 7.3.15. Rituals and Community E vents Village rs in Salvo par ticipated in Rod anthe's Old Christm as, belying the se ntiment that Salvo was relatively independent from the other Chicam acom ico communities. According to a Salvo resident, Old Christm as was a bigger cele bration than Christm as, and during his childhood it was m uch more of a religious celebration than today's event. \"It was what people here believ ed was the true birth of Christ. \" Child ren received \"a little pape r bag with an orange, apple, and a couple of walnuts. That was a big present.\" A resident rem embered the old b lack face minstrels that were once part of the celeb ration. \"Everyone would black up their face a nd have a play and act like they were co lored people.\" The plays were light-hearted and co mical. \"W hen I was growing up around Christm as time you would dress up in old clothes and hats and m aybe black your face, or put a stocking over it and go around to everybody's house and they would give you pie and cake and all kinds 155 of things.\" A wom an described why she quit attending the ev ent in recen t years desp ite her lov e for oysters. \"If it's a sin for m e to take part with their drinking, it's a sin to m e to come up here to eat oysters.\" A village r played guitar at Old Chris tmas celebra tions, as we ll as squa re dances th at took place at the school th roughout the year. \"W e used to have ch icken schoo lteacher and fiddl er. They played tradition al tunes such as \"Red River Valley\" and \"Com ing Around the Mountain.\" People no longer gather like they used to, he lam ented. Funerals, like weddings, were sim ple and pr actical. \"W e had them , but it was a very simple ceremony, and then we put them in the ground.\" Before em balming, such quick funerals were necess ary, and peo ple typ ically \"sat up with the dead\" th e night before a burial. 7.3.16. National Park S ervice Some Salvo residents share other islanders ' belief that sand dunes cause, not prevent, erosion, and blam e the National Park Service fo r taking part in dune-building. \"You get that surge because of northeast winds pushing water th rough the inlets into th e Sound.\" After the eye of the storm passes, \"you get a s udden shift of wind and a ll that water tr ies to com e back at once. It's taken days to get there.\" The dunes \"block the water from going back into the ocean and we get floods. The dunes protect the houses of the people who don't have any m ore brains than to build right o n the ocean. \" A village r touched on the hard f eeling s island ers h ad for the Nationa l Park Service land acquisition. \"A lot of people were upset. They didn't want to ge t tangled up with the governm ent.\" His grandfather \"had 44 acres down south of Salvo, south of the cam pground, 156 from the campground down to them pine trees do wn there. I think they gave him about $750.00 for it.\" Yet, he conceded that, despite his ange r that the Na tional Park Service rem oved the old dipping vat from the Salvo cam pground, the estab lishm ent of the National Seashore was \"m aybe a good thing \" because \"we are not smothered to death with all th at riff-raff and house s and whatever th ey build on the beaches. \" The m any dipping vats still scatte red along Hatteras Island hold sentimental v alue to island ers recalling ol d roundups of horses and cattle; for th e National Park Service to dig them up is akin to prying out yet another artifact of Banker culture, although some worry that the vats - long ago filled with poison - are linked to a seem ingly high rate of cancer on the island and ar e glad to see them go. 7.3.17. Coast Guard and the Military Residents of Salvo had a network of fathers, uncles, brothers, and cousins in the Coas t Guard (Figure 7.3.7). Many also worked for th e ferry division, fished commercially, or were hunting and fishing guides. Five m iles south of Salvo was the Gull Shoal Coast Guard Station, originally called Cedar Humm ock when put in commission in 1878. W recks and rescues were common all along Chicam acom ico and near Salv o in particular, such as the barkentine Prisc illa that foundered in 1899. Gull Shoal S urfman Ras mus Midgett fa mously rescued ten people from that wreck without assistance. The G.A. Kohler , a four-m asted schooner, also wrecked near Gull Shoal in the 1933 storm ; both the Gull Shoal a nd Chicam acom ico crews were called to rescue the eigh t-man crew. The Kohler was sold to Av on business man Charles William s for $150 includ ing all but the s ails. William s then sold it for the sam e price to Leo nard Hooper of Salvo, and the tim bers were used to build the Salvo Assem bly of God church. 157 Figure 7.3.7. Surfm an's Grave, Salvo Day Use Area. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. Chicam acom ico residents were in close pr oxim ity of Pea Island Coast Guard station, manned by a n all b lack crew. A village wom an rem embered encounterin g this crew in the m id- 1930s: I had never seen a black m an. I was scared so bad that when I seen th ese three m en coming up the road, on a horse - one was in each track. Oh, m y Lord! I thought the dickens was after m e! I ran behind my great -gran dmother's h ouse to tell her what I'd seen, and she and m y grandfather laughe d just as hard as they could.\" The Civilian Conservatio n Corps was activ e in Salvo in the 1930s, building a road near the Assem bly of God church that forked off Highway 12 and led to the ocean. 158 7.3.18. Political Life Practical-m inded islanders becom e involved in politics when there is a specific need or concern. A villager ran for Dare County comm ission becau se of his diss atisfaction with the island's water and desire for a water plant. \"The water he re was horri ble. All we had was ground water, well water, surface water. In th e old days, we collected rain water to d rink. But the ground water was like tea - brown and stunk terr ible.\" A Republican, he was elected in the early 1980s and the com mission had a Republican m ajority f or the first tim e in 120 years. He laughed that the local paper's headline read, \"T he W alls of the Courthouse Trem bled.\" A reverse osmosis desalinati on plant w as then built in Rodanthe. \"We've now got som e of the best water in the country,\" h e declared. He was also instrum ental in getti ng a modern jail built in Manteo with a 911 communications system . 7.3.19. Modernity and Perceptions of Change Village rs ge nerally agr ee that lif e before W WII was sim pler and f ree of class dif ferences. \"We were dirt poor,\" observed a fellow, \"but , I didn't know that unt il later years because everyone was the sam e.\" He added th at \"nobody ever went hu ngry because whatever o ne had, it was shared.\" He described his fam ily drivi ng to Manteo to buy fl our and sugar in 100 pound bags, to be shared by \"fam ily, everyone in the village just about.\" This is in contrast to today, where islanders experience gr eat class differences; although many live m odest, m iddle-class lives, they dwell am id an aggressive a nd unprecedented level of affluence. The rate of change accelerated greatly af ter W orld W ar II with electricity com ing in 1948, the paved highway in 1953, and the bridg e in 1963. A villager said that the ro ad connecting Hatteras Island to the m the area \"from para dise to nothing.\" He felt 159 like the road was a gateway to population growth and a loss of fr eedom . \"Prior to the road, I could hunt and fish or do anyt hing I wanted to, everyday. Af ter that there were too many restrictions, and laws and stu ff com e. Here com e all the people, they found us.\" A Salvo resident believed that the vill age was transfor ming not only because of new people m oving in, but because native people were dying off or m oving off- island. \"They have different jobs and stuff. There's not much to do here. There are so m any laws now on fishing and stuff like that why, people got disgusted and left.\" Young peopl e in particular \"finish high school and go away to college, then they m ove a way.\" Although tourists and sport fisherm en have long visited Hatteras and Ocracoke, and islanders worked as hunting and fishing guides, the m ethods and philosophy behind recreational fishing are hard for som e to com prehend: \"I don 't fish with a pole like this so called \"sport fishing\". We fished for a purpose with utensils - to me it's a waste of time to wait f or a fish to come along and get on the end of a line.\" Is landers also have difficulty com prehending the negative view som e sportsm en and sports publicati ons have toward nets and commercial fishing. Another change noted by villagers pertaine d to crim e and drug abuse. In the 1980s the drug of choice was m arijuana but, du ring th e last decade, th e substance s have becom e much more dangerous. A m ember of the L adies Auxili ary said that the drug and alcohol problem in the villages is m aking it hard for the fire depa rtments to find \"new blood\" and young recruits. \"If Heaven is like Salvo, I don't want to go,\" she stated in reference to the state of the village today. Some villag ers noted tha t more islan ders seem to be suf fering f rom cancer than in the past. A resident wondered if processed, chem ical-laden foods played a role. \"W hen I was growing up, there could have been cancers, but, I do believe the f ood that we eat today is against 160 you.\" Sheer num bers of people and the accom panying developm ent are transform ing the communities of Hatteras Island. A v illager d iscussed the \"W ind over W aves\" develo pment going up north of Salvo where livestock was once penned: That should have been made into a natural park for Rodanthe, Waves, and Salvo instead of being destroyed - there's deer, otter, m ink, muskrat, squirrel, and all kinds of animals over there. They're destroying, th ey're tear ing the trees down, they're pu lling them up by the roots with a bulldozer. Yet, m any conceded that the job situation has improved greatly. \"I think it's b een m ore for the better than the worse. More people have jobs. You can always pick up a job around here.\" People in the past were poor of possessi ons but not of other thi ngs. \"There's a lot of things they didn't have, but they had their churches and they had God and I think they were rich. 'Cause they were very spiritual people.\" Desp ite new people pouring in to the village every day, \"the original people that lived in this neighborhood are very clos e...If one gets sick, the whole neighborhood feels it.\" 161 7.4. Avon 7.4.1. Name, Place, an d Features Avon villag e (Figure 7. 4.1), only th ree feet abo ve sea level, was known as Kinnakeet long after the post office a dopted the new na me in 1883. Kinnakeet, an A lgonkian word meaning \"that which is m ixed\" ( William s 1975), was one of the earlies t settlem ents on Hatteras Islands, and originally referred to an area extending from Buxton Woods t o Salvo. It included the village of Kinnakeet proper, and two ex tinct settlem ) and Little Kinnakeet, the latter which was abandoned upon the clo sing o f Little Kinn akeet Coas t Guard stat ion; som e residents appa rently r elocated to Roanoke Island while others m to Kinnakeet pr oper or other Hatteras villages (Payne 1985). The nam e \"Avon\" m ay be from the Avon Rive r in England, but no one knows why it was selected (ibid). In the 1 700s, Kinnakeet was home to the illiam , Miller, ooper; later the fa mily nam e beca me prom inent. Kinnakeet w as known for its stands of live oa k and cedar trees, a resource that enabled boat building to flourish in the village. During the Colonial period, dugouts and kunners- large canoes fashioned from three juniper logs-were m anufactured. By 1820, tim bers were cut for use in clipper sh ips, and sm all oyster s chooners and s loops were b uilt. Kinn akeet was one of the most thriving villages on Hatteras before Ha tteras Inlet was opened in 1846, whereupon Hatteras village soon becam e the econom ic center. After the Civil W ar, shallow draft shad boats and sharpies were built in Avon. Boat building pe tered out, however, as trees were over harvested and becam e scarce. San d hills thrived in areas denuded of trees, and an in creas e in san d dune move ment further dam aged rem aining vegetation. The \"sand wave of Hatteras\" was a giant 162 dune that traveled from the ocean to the s ound at Kinnakeet; by 1890 it h ad covered f orests and unearthed graves, m oving about 20 feet per m onth (Stick 1958, 286). Figure 7.4.1. Satellite Im age of Avon. Source: NC Division of Marine F isheries. Today the term Kinnakeet is still used, and Kinnakeeters refers to na tive villagers in the village proper, as opposed to the greate r Avon area of shopping centers, a Cineplex, subdivisions, and rental beach hom es. With th e exception of Ocracoke, n o village is more distant from the other vi llages than A von; it is seven m iles north of Buxton and 20 m iles south of Salvo. No village is as surrounde d by developments, either. The village proper is not visible from Hi ghway 12. Avon has the only two traffic lights on Hatteras, and one m arks the road into old Kinnak eet. Kinn akeet ha s a circ ular layou t, with in 163 intriguing m ix of shady side roads and loops. Ma ny of the houses are historical, with concrete cisterns still in place but unused. Som e houses in Kinnakeet are new, and there is an assortm ent of mobile hom es and pre-fabricated h ouses. A land berm or \"diken\" was built around the village after the 1933 storm to keep the ocean at bay but, when Hurricane Gloria flooded the village in 1985, people blam ed the dike for preventing the sound waters from escaping. Others felt that the dike was necessary: The ocean tide used to af fect us bad som etimes. Go into the house, wash the chicken coop down. They dug a canal all the way ar ound Avon as a drain and put the levy up. I think it helped quite a bit. But now they 're tearing it down. And one day they're going to pay for it. It'll com e back to haunt them . After the 1944 storm , dredge boats pum ped sand from the sound side of Avon in order to build up the ocean side beach. This dredg ing created a cut extendin g from the form er site of Little Kinnakeet C oast Guard station to Buxton, and incl uded the \"haulover\" or \"Canadian Hole\" site just south of the village where wooden vessels were once hauled across from sound to ocean. This site is now a popular windsurfing spot. Manson Meekins and h is sister Mary Gray (now deceased ) describ ed the Avon hom e in which they were raised in the 1920s: it was a \"T \" shaped house with a kitchen annex and dining room built on the eas t side (Figure 7 .4.2). It had two-stories, five bedroo ms, a front and back porch, and a sitting room or parlor. L ike m ost of the old Outer Banks homes, it was a continuous \"work in progress\" with a variet y of modifications and additions over tim e - this a ttests to the adaptability and thriftin ess of the islanders. The fam ily cooked with a wood stove and heated with another located in the dining ro om where, according to Meekins, \"p eople would gather in the evening or just before going to bed.\" There was no heat upstairs. W hen the kids were ready to go to bed, they'd just get warm ed up and, in real cold weather, you'd run and jum p in the feather bed. W e had feather beds m ade from goose, brant, and duck feathers. And after you shivered about 164 three or four m inutes, you' d settle down to a good night's sleep. But it w as cold, particularly if you had to ge t up and go to the bathroom . Figure 7.4.2. Meekins H omeplace, Avon. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. Village rs later switch ed to coal or o il, and Manso n Meekins r emembers when the coun ty would \"bring a pile of coal in the fall of the year and pile it u p at the corn er of the school yard. I think people from the village in those days went in and helped them selves.\" A resident recalled when his m other got her first oi l stove. \"My m other told dad dy, 'If you want m e to cook again next year yo u better buy m e an oil stove, because I'm not going to have this wood sto ve.' Can you im agine in July cooking fried spots (a type of lo cal fish) out there in that little kitchen? So, he bought her a Aladdin oil stove. It was beautif ul - it was off-white and green.\" A Hatteras storekeeper nam ed Shank Austin acquired several oil bu rners that cou ld be attached to the 165 Aladdin sto ve. The burn ers \"had a little g lass jar\" for oil; the first fam ily in Avon to equip their stove with this new apparatus found that \"every body com e in here looking at that [oil] stove.\" In the \"T\" shaped Meekins house, the family had m ahogany furniture from the G.A. Kohler that wrecked in the '33 storm. The house was surrounded by what Mary Gray called a \"paling\" fence to keep out cattle, horses, hogs , and sheep. Houses typically had several outbuildings, including a sm okehous e. \"Everyone ha d wire f ences or picket fences or plank fencing. It wasn't to m ark the property lines, but to keep the anim als out of your yard.\" The Meekins had an outhouse until 1947 wh en electricity cam e to the village and m ade water pum ps and insid e plum bing possible. The ho meplace still stands tod ay, in 2004; children visiting from off-island stay there and a fam ily m ember \"cuts the grass and sort of keeps watch on the old thing.\" Today's Harbor Road did not exist before World War II, and the harbor area was a swamp. \"The creek in the m iddle of the swam p ran from the Pa mlico Sound right on up through the village, separating D og Ridge (southern half) from Cat Ridge (northern side).\" Kinnakeeters referred to \"Cat Ridgers\" and \"Dog Ridgers,\" and joked that the nam es cam e about because families living in those areas \"fought like cats and dogs.\" A cart p ath an d four-inch wide footbridge connected Cat Ridge and Dog Ridge, before the mouth of the creek was dug out in 1947 to form the harbor and the surrounding m arshy area was filled. The east edg e of the village bordering th e swam p was called the \"Hills. \" An ar ea further south was ca lled \"Po t Head,\" and a collection of houses on the northern border was refe rred to as the North'ar d or \"Spain\" (Figure 7.4.3). About a m ile south of the village beyon d Pot Head was once a settlem ent called the South'ard (Map 7.4). Several f amilies lived do wn the South'ard. And in m y time there was m aybe f our or f ive houses left down there. But it was quite a walk in those days for people to com e up to 166 shop to the stores, and they eventually all m oved away or m oved up to the village here in Avon, and their houses just went to pot. On the south end of Avon is a little cut known as \"First Creek,\" where a schooner washed up in the 1933 storm and the sailor sim ply lived on it aground for a few years. A villager recalled fisherm en com ing from Core Sound in Ca rteret County to cam p in First Creek while fishing for speckled trout. \"They used to live on l ittle cab in boats back th ere.\" Alm ost two m iles south of the village proper on th e Pam lico Sound side is a tida l stream known as Askins Creek, just south of Black Hammock Marsh (Payne 1985). Today in the southern part of the village proper are a couple of canals dug in the 1970s for an early developm ent known as \"Port Avon.\" 167 Figure 7.4.3. The North'ard, circa 1940. Illustration by Manson Meekins. 168 Map 7.4. Avon Village with Histor ical Sites (no t to scale). Sketch by B. Garrity -Blake. 169 Like all the villages, Avon ha d its share of m osquitoes, particularly before m osquito ditches were dug. \"I've seen m osquito gluts here and it looked like sm oke com ing out of a smoke stack.\" 7.4.2. Relation to Other Villages an d Beyond Avon villag ers, in com paring their comm unity with oth er Hatteras communities, stres sed that their village was unique, independent, and geographically set- apart. Unlike the Rodanthe/Waves/Salvo or Hatteras/Frisco/Buxt on trios, Avon stands alone m idway down Hatteras Island, 12 m iles south of Salvo and six m iles north of B uxton. \"Rodanthe was Midgetts. T hey all stuck together, they didn't like people from W aves, it was just clannish,\" a Kinnakeeter said. \"Salvo was kind of a m ild place. Then you had Avon, which was totally separate - A von's alway s kind of been on its ow n.\" Villag ers found it a challenge to keep their intertwined, multi-gen erationa l kin r elations s traight: My m other's grandfather was m arried five tim es. The last tim e he m arried he was 65, and he m arried a 16-year old girl and father ed two boys. You wouldn't believe the kids he had. My mother never knew who her gr andm other was. S he said, \"I don't know which one of the children was m y grandm other.\" An old-tim er recalled a bitter winter, po ssibly of 1914, when the sound froze. She was a child living at Little Kinnakeet , the station north of Chica macom ico near Avon. Men from Rodanthe arrived on foot looking for food and supplie s, as they could not launch their vessels. The resid ents of Little K innakee t helped them out, as peop le did in tim es of stress: The people up to Rodanthe had eat their f ood up. Two m en walked down from Roda nthe and took up on their back what food they could. The sound was froze up and they couldn't get down here [by boat]. And the ground was frozen - they couldn't drive horses on the frozen ground. 170 Avon was heavily em ployed in the Coast Gu ard, and, therefore, had well-traveled community m embers who had experienced numerous assignm ents around the country. Those in the m ilitary were exposed to the wid er world. A villager lived in Tam pa, New York, Honolulu, Detroit, and Norfolk, and during W orld War II was on a ship that toured Japan, the Philippines, and China. A resident reflected on the differences that she perc eived between Hatteras Islanders and of f-islan d communities. \"I r ealiz ed [in living off-island] that the re was always so mething different about this place. W e didn't have ever ything but the people were different here - they're more though tful of each other. Until progress, it was like one big fam ily.\" A new bride m oved to Avon in 1932 at age 17 from New York. She had m arried an Avon m an serving in the Coast Guard, and experi enced quite a shock when she m oved to his barrier islan d hom e: No roads nowheres - sandy car ruts, and the ca ttle and horses was r oving free. After we bought the old church and m oved up here, the outhouse was back there in the m arsh and there was no trees, it was all the saltw ater grass. I went to the outhouse, and when I turned to com e back there was this old br indle bull between m e and the house, and I was stuck out there for about two hour s. He was a gentle old thing, but I was from New York and I didn't know nothing about gentle bulls. Her husband's fam ily treated her like th eir own, however, and \"everyone was nice and wonderful.\" She noted that all the w omen wo re sunbonnets. It was disconcerting, however, when \"the cattle would com e and scrape their horns at night on the side of the house,\" as her house was near a watering hole. The area was called \"Frog Marsh\" and \"good, fat, hoppy toads, hundreds of them in the evening, com e up here in the yard.\" Her first experience fishing with her husband was m emorable: He was going to take us out in the boat in the m iddle of the day, on a little picnic. And I was from New York, and I never drove a boat. Well, he puts m e at the wheel and says, \"Starboard this way, that way.\" I didn't ev en know what \"starboard\" m eant. I run her aground. That was the wrong thing to do. We stayed aground for I don't know how long, and his m outh was a-going continually. 171 Avon fa milies som etimes made the trip to No rfolk to shop. A villager recalled going to the shoe store with her sister so regularly that the proprie tor had a nicknam e for them: We had this one place th at we'd go to, and they had their sh oes setting o ut in th e showroom . We had to buy the ones that they'd show us. They were called sam ples because they just had th e small ones in the s amples. The oth ers was too big for us. W e had such small feet. They called us the Sam ple Girls. 7.4.3. School Nineteenth century children were educated in various people's hom es by volunteer teachers. When the firs t state school was built in the village, \"Dog Ridgers\" and \"Cat Ridgers\" lobbied for the consolidated facil ity to be located in their resp ective part o f the village (W illiam s 1975). Around the tu rn of the century, a school wa s built in the south ern part of the v illage between Dog Ridge and Pot Head. By the 1920s th e school taught through the ninth grade. One student attended eighth grade in Ma nteo, ninth grade in Buxton, and 10th grade at a school in Black Mountain. She finished high school in Hatt eras Village. She rem embered the school in Avon as \"one room after another, m aybe five room s like an old m otel.\" There was a potbelly stove that w as stoked by the chil dren first thing in the m orning. \"It was quite a while before things would get warm enough so you could really hear what the teacher was saying. \" One hundred yards away toward the beach were two priv ies, one for the boys and one for the girls. The students had \"regular spellers\" and readers in all the bas ic subjects. Manson Meekins attended Avon school through mo st of the ninth grade, but \"I didn't go any higher\" because the 1933 storm \"washed th e schoolhouse down.\" The rem ainder of the school took place in priv ate homes.\" He finished 10th grade at Hatteras, and graduated after the 11th grade in Elizabeth City in the early 1930s. Wh ile attending school in Elizabeth City, the '33 storm hit just before his f ather was due to send him m oney for books. The wind shifted out of 172 the northwest and blew the water out of the Pas quatank River; Meekins and his friend explored the m uddy river bottom and m ade a find that provided the m eans for him to buy his own books; they discovered a huge pile of \"ring dogs.\" [Ring dog] i s a wedged shape tool about six or eight inches lo ng with a ring in it. They were used to drive that w edge into log raft s and run chains through the rings to keep the rafts together to bring th e logs to the m ill. Som eone found out that we had them , and he gave us six cents ap iece. After the old schoolhous e was destro yed by th e 1933 storm , a new school was built in the Cat Ridge portion of the village tow ard the \"Nor th'ard \" across from Pritc hard Gray's store. Kinnakeet s tudents a ttended this s chool from 1935 until 195 5, when the new Cape Hatte ras School was built and all the village s chools cons olidated in to one. Kinnakeet School was the las t to shut dow n, as the other villages sent their chil dren to the old Cape Ha tteras School two years prior. The Nationa l Park playe d an im portant role in en suring r egular educa tion for villag e youth. For exam ple, the Ocracoke S chool-am ong the first on the isla nd-was instituted to educate the child ren of the surfm en working at the Life Saving Station. One villag er, born in 1898, reported that L ittle Kinnakeet station, north of Avon, ha d its own school which she attended until age 15. T hen she \"com e down he re to Avon School, and I boarded to my aunt's.\" 7.4.4. Chur ch Church was long the center of the commun ity in Avon, and som e people noted that people had a \"deeper faith in God than they have today.\" \"We grew up mo stly in the church,\" said an o ld-tim er. Until the la te 192 0s, there we re two chur ches in th e village : the so uthern Methodists and the northern Methodists. Then cam e the Pentecostal faith: \"My fam ily were Methodist in the beginn ing but later after they were sav ed, they becam e Assem bly of God,\" 173 explained Mary Gray. T he Methodist churches eventually united to fo rm one congregation, the St. Johns United Methodist church. The old Me thodist Church North, lo cated on the north end of the village, was converted into a villager's hom e before it was torn down in 2004. The inhabitant explained the differen ce between the churches as \"the Methodists is dead, dead, dead and the Assembly is up, up, up.\" Some of the early 20th century Avon preachers in cluded Mr. Johnson, Mr. Fitz, Mr. Pilcher, Mr. Altree, M r. Reagan, and Andrew Price. One of the preach ers traveled up to Little Kinnakeet to preach on a designated Sunday. A 19th century Avon preacher nam ed Anderson Gray was famous for his boom ing serm ons at reviva ls, and legend has it that he had no need to travel to Little Kinnakeet, as his voice carri ed that far (MacNeill 1958). His fa mous serm on around 1847 railed against the evils of a new-fangled thr eat to civilization and honest hard work: steam . The will of wind was the will of God, and the only allowable departure f rom natural and spiritual law - well, it was no sin for a m an to take a stout oar in his hand for short distan ces. B ut the fires that m en built under po ts to m ake steam to blow them , even against the wind - well, such fires w ere ak in to the f ires of hell itse lf (MacNeill 195 8, 128). Avon was the birthplace of the Pentecosta l faith on the Outer Banks. Methodist missionary Myrtle Chambers and her husband sailed to the village on the Missou ri from Elizabeth City in 1926. They were invited to pitc h a tent beside the Southern Methodist Church for spring revival, and began attracting villagers with an especially ferv ent style of preaching. Many villagers were \"saved,\" including som e surfmen from Little and Big Kinnakeet stations. The following year, June of 1927, Cham bers returned and held a cam p meeting so anticipated that both the northern and sout hern Methodist churches can celled their services, and the preachers attended the \"several week \" long rev ival (Rasnak e 1999, 40). As the third annual 174 revival approached, Methodist preachers and elders who had grown uncomfortable with the displays of emotion, announced the excommunica tion of Pentecostal believers for \"em otionalism and fanaticism \" (ibid, 50). This led to the esta blishm ent of a n Assem bly of God congregation and church. The religious split was one of th e most significant changes that Kinnakeeters experienced in the 1920s and 30s. Villagers recal led div ided fam ilies, deep disagreements, and hurt feelings am ong children whose fa mily \"got religion\" and could no l onger sing secular songs with their classm ates. An elderly resident rem embered the old cam p meetings. She said that people would cook biscuits and molasses bread to br ing to the event. They m ade makeshift tents and spread quilts beneath them. There were large can vas ten ts with seats for the reviv al. The cam p meeting s, lasting for \"three or four days,\" would attract villagers from Chicam acom ico, Hatteras village, and even Stum py Point across the so und. The re vivals would begin each morning with a six o'clock prayer m eeting. \"You weren't allowed to eat breakfast until after that. My youngest sister was christened at that la st cam p meeting. She was six mont hs old.\" Another villager did not recall the m eetings, but heard a lot about them. Just this side of the harbor, there was a nice, sandy beach landing where they'd hold camp meetings. And the word would get around and people from Hatteras, Manteo, Wanchese, across the sound, would gather down there. They would sleep in tents. They'd be people selling drinks, m aybe lem onade. The people in the village would help feed them . Villagers bu ilt a large ta bernacle to worship at the landing, using plank ing for pews and m arsh reeds for a thatched roof; oil lant erns were hung all around (W illiam s 1975). The \"exhorters\" or p reachers cam e around and \"people would be converted.\" A villag er supposed that the newly converted were not so much transform ed in a religious sense, but were attracted to the fellowship and social activit ies; he joked that a ll the \"congregating and 175 assem bling\" bordered on the \"pornog raphic\" as \"young people will be yo ung people. Hear all kind of tales.\" The Pentecostals and Methodist s did not always see eye to eye, and shared a friendly rivalry as illustra ted by a n anecdote : \"They sa id that the Asse mbly of God was singing , 'Will there be any stars in m y crown?' This was on Sunday m orning, and the Methodist Church was singing 'No, not one.' T hey always told that st uff.\" Som e suggest that the Assem bly of God, when establishing them selves in Avon, benefited from rifts within the Methodist church and siphoned off m embers; once the M ethodist chu rches united, s ome villagers objected to giving up their old church, and protested by attending the Assem bly of God. The Assem bly of God m et each Sunday , whereas th e Method ist church shar ed a preach er with Chicam acom ico and held services only two Sundays a m onth, creating a space for peop le to attend the Pentecostal services. There were f our sisters from Avon, mem bers of the Methodis t church. Just before one died, she said that the Methodist Church ha d invited [the Pentecostals] there to do a revival. They cam e and brought their own m usicians. Th ey brought everything, set up beside the Methodis t Church in Av on, and then split it. Her idea was th at it was the worst thing that ever happened to her church. On the other hand there are m any people who have always worshiped in both churches, back and forth. Mem bers of the Avon Worship Center, as the Assem bly of God church was called, built a new church after the 1933 storm , using the turnbuckles of the G.A. Kohler to anchor each corner of the building with cables. The church cons equently survived the 1944 storm , and was m oved to the harbor a few years later. 7.4.5. Stores The general stores of Avon were m eeting places as well as p laces of commerce. According to a resident, the general store \"is where we got all our inform ation.\" A wom an 176 raised in Little Kinnakee t said th at the Coast Guar d settlem ent had no store. \" We used to have to walk down here to Avon from Kinnakeet Station a nd take our groceries back up. If we could get a horse and cart, we could get into it.\" They bought flour, cornm eal, sugar, coffee, lard, beans, peas, canned tomatoes, and canned b eef. Village rs could no t purchase f resh eggs, m eat, or bread, but had to procure their own. \"I was te lling som ebody a few days ago, down at Food Lion (a local grocery chain store), this old m an, I said what do you think these old people would do, walk in Food Lion and see all this food. My God, they couldn't believe it!\" Luther Meekins, George Meekins, and Edison Meekins were three of the earlier proprietors. Charlie W illiam s delivered m eat by truck to Avon stores each Thursday, and before he began that route people rem embered a m an named \"Porkc hop\" who provided the service from Curritu ck. One large r establishm ent bef ore W orld War II was Gibb Gray's Genera l Store that operated from the m id-1920s to the m id-1960s. Gi bb Gray kept an iron safe, in which he held not only his own valuables but th e savings of his neighbors. In the1944 storm Gray took all the money and put it into a bag; to escape the rising waters he sat in a tree holding the sack and keeping everyone's savings safe (MacNeill 1958) . Pritchard Gray, Ersk ine Fields Meekins, A ndrew Meekins, Noah Price, Farr ow Scarborough, Edgar Mi ller, Lorenzo \"Ranz\" Gray, and George Oliver O'Neal also ran stores. Fields Meekin s was blind, and had a guide rope running from his house to the store (Figure 7.4.4). Pritchard Gray's father ran a wire to his store from a Delco generator, and the fam ily would hold dances there with a jukebox. \"And we'd go out there to that store and put ye llow m eal on the floor. And that made the prettiest yellow floor you've ever seen. Clean ed it right u p.\" A von Shopping Center and Tackle, run by the W illiam s family, was one of the first stores located on the highway; it operated during the 1950s when the 177 paved road f irst ran to Hatteras and then to Roda nthe. Avon children traded eggs to storekeepers for penny candy. Figure 7.4.4. Fields Meekins' Old Store. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. 178 Stores typically had a big barrel where patrons could fish out a pickle for a nickel. They had these pickles into a big keg. A nd I keep dipping down in there, running my hand down in there. I'd have to go around all in there to find the biggest one. And I'd lay the others on the keg, and lot of them [children] would take one of them pickles, and put it up their bloom er leg. Get a free one, y'know? Charles W illiam 's trucking business supplied the island with goods. A driver said, \"If you could have seen the re frigerators we hauled after they put that electricity down here!\" They took orders up and down the island at comm unity st ores and Coast Guard st ations once a week. They picked up orders in Norf olk and delive red th em to island stores, sta tions, and f amilies. Mainland salesm en, or \"drumm ers,\" sailed or drove to the island and took orders. They comprised an im portant custom er for the fledglin g hotel business. In Avon, salesm en stayed at the only place available: the A von Hotel located on the outer loop of the village proper (Figure 7.4.5). W hen the Avon Hotel was b uilt in 1952 it wa s the second one on Hatteras Is land; the first was the Atlantic View Hotel in Hatteras villag e, built in the 1 920s . Boat builder W illie Austin built the Av on Hotel, an d his wife ran it; late r the couple's d aughter and h er husband took it over. She cooked, cleaned the room s, and ra n the desk. The daughter recalled charging salesm en and sport fisherm en $2.50 per night pl us $1.75 for a big breakfast. A Buxton wom an worked as manager and cook at the twenty-room hot el. She said the hotel was relatively large compared to two sm aller ones in Buxton, and som etimes had prom inent visitors such as state senators. We served breakfast, lunch, and dinner. At six o'clock [a.m .] I had those grills going. Lunch was skim py, a couple or so parties off th e street. Boarders would start com ing in from fishing or the beach about five, and suppe r was from five to seven. Twenty-five or 30 dinners. Each week I had two deliveries . The owner's father bought food in Norfolk, and peddled it down here on the is land to all the s tores. Winters were slow, but som etimes work crews, such as the ro ad builders of the Dicke rson Com pany, boarded at the Avon Ho tel and provided business: 179 One winter I had Dickerson, Inc. m en here for a couple of m onths, and they were working around the lighthouse putting new road s around it. I would get up and m ake 30 eggs scram bled. They would get big platters fu ll of bacon and eggs or sausage and eggs. Lots of toast. W e would just put it on the ta ble and let them help them selves. They were charged a certain am ount per day. That was a good winter, because of incom e com ing in. Figure 7.4.5. Old Avon Hotel next to Modern W ater Tower. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. An Avon old-tim er recalled that only a few people had radios when they first cam e available. \"Clemmy Gr ay had one. An Atwater Ke nt - a big cabinet rad io.\" Because he drove a freight truck and had access to goods, som eone o ffered to trade him his radio for two cans of paint. If you give m e a couple gallons of paint, I'd trade you that radio, [he said]. So, I went and got him a couple of gallons of cheap paint, a blue or purple. You had to have three A batteries [to operate the radio] , and a D battery. T here wasn't any electricity. You could have her on and she'd be playing. If you walk ed across the floor, she'd change stations. I told him , and he said, \"I'm glad of it, that's what you get for giving m e that grape paint.\" 180 7.4.6. Pastimes and Childhood Activities Teens gathered at different friends' houses to cook chicken stew. \"W e cooked anything we could get our hands o n and that w ould have been a par ty.\" A village r remembered her mother warning her not to invite any boys who stole chickens. \"But, m ost of the tim e they would [steal chickens].\" Her fa mily had a pi ano in the hom e, and her friends would gather around to sing. Teenagers also liked to pilfer collards and cook them with dum plings. Some man come here wanting to know if I wa s the one tha t ate them colla rds tha t was stole from this m an. I wasn't going to ad mit it. \"I don't know anything about it.\" He said, \"W e're trying to find out who they we re, they were poisoned.\" Aah, they were going to see what we would do about it. Som eone told us, \"They're just trying to find out who got the collards.\" A Coast Guardsm an's son m oved to Beaufort when his father got transferred to Fort Macon and attended high school there for six months . \"I played in the first football gam e I ever saw. Didn't have football in Avon.\" Swimming was the m ain activity for young boys. \"No traffic on the beach, we'd just pull off our clothes and go naked,\" recalled a villager . \"See a car com ing from a long distance, we'd go in the ocean and let it pass. And we swa m in the sound, lot of crabs, things that make swimming in the sound inconvenient and painful at times.\" The \"sea tides,\" or occasional ocean overwash f rom Atla ntic to the P amlico, of fered entertainm ent for Avon children. \"The water would com e in m ass over towards th ese creeks, a nd kids in the summ ertim e would swi m in the heads of these creeks as the water would pile down through. And you could swim at great speed with the cu rrent from the ocean com ing down through these creeks.\" Hatteras Village was th e \"place of ex citem ent\" for Avon teen agers in the 1930s and 40s because of d ances and m ovies. \"So the boys of A von, if one of them could get their father's car, we would go down there of a Saturday night.\" They would stop in Frisco, where \"somebody 181 would go to an old house down there, and pretty soon they'd com e back with a pint of corn whiskey that cost a dollar.\" So we'd take the whiskey and go out to Fr isco w oods and all get out. Som ebody would light a cigarette for a ch aser. They 'd open the bo ttle and each guy would take a big slu g of the stuff and pass quickly to the other guy, and he'd start beating his breast, trying to get his breath. By the tim e we got to Hatte ras I'd be feeling pretty good but nobody really got drunk. Although so me of the fellows from different villag es would fight each o ther, the h ighlight of the evening was the pavilion square dances where musicians such as fiddler Jam es Austin, now deceased, w ould play. Manson Meekins, age 8 9, recalled : Along the sides there'd be benches where pe ople would sit. People were hobnobbing and laughing, enjoying themselves. But when th e music started, people would of course gather around in the center. It wasn't all fighting. It was a good fellowship down there. But all that stuff is gone. A night out in Avon m eant leaving the village by 4: 00 pm to drive to a 7:30 m ovie. If they returned right after the movie, they arrived back in Avon by midnight. The only beer hall in Avon was the \"You Come In\" near the Avon Hote l, operating during the World W ar II period. Teenagers in the 1920s they held square danc es at the old seaweed building or \"sea oar house.\" W here Kinnakeeters got term \"sea oar\" is unclear; one resident surm ised that it was from the old English term \"seawar\" for seawee d. But, the storage house f or seaweed bound for the m arket doubled as a social hall. One pe rson \"played harmonica, another the banjo, and a third the drum,\" while a caller directed the da nce. Som e Kinnakeeters w ere wary of these dances, such as a father who \"cam e down there af ter his g irl,\" unable to find her hiding behind huge bales of seaweed. We'd blow the lights out, and every one of us would go get behind the bunches of sea oars that they had fixed up ready to be sent off. We was hiding all around. He said \"Mary?\" and I said [in a gruff voice], \"This is not Mary.\" I didn't want him to know my voice. \"She's not here.\" 182 A superintendent from the Methodist church did not approve of the sea oar house dances, and tried to \"find out who was down th ere that Saturday night.\" I guess they were going to turn them out in church. So, he cam e here, m y mother told him, she said \" Well, I can tell you that m y oldest daughter w asn't into it. But I don't know about my youngest one.\" She said, \"They're young, and you've been young once, and I don't think they should be turned out of the church, I th ink they should be put in church, and talked to about things.\" \"People used to go down to the beach of an evening,\" said a villager. Evening for old- timers is the afternoon. \"But I didn't do m uch bath ing in the sea. I was afraid of that.\" She enjoyed sitting quietly to crochet and em broide r. \"Didn't have no TV or nothing - everyone mostly croc heted and e mbroidered pillowca ses and covers a nd things, th em days.\" Her f avorite pastim e was cooking candy as a teenager: Put sugar an d cocoa together, and m ilk, and boil it until it go t kind of hard and pour it out. And we used to boil sugar and m ake candy, and put som e vinegar into it, pull it. It got so tough you could m ake twistie s out of it and lay it in a pa n. It's good! That vinegar gives it a little sour ta ste. Girls and boys also got togeth er of a night to fix that fudge. A wom an recalled cutting paper dolls out of store catalogues; she and her friends played a gam e called \"eat su re 'nuf\": \"I'd com e to m y house and get salt, p epper, sugar, or so mething. Some of the others would go to their house and get som ething like tea, coffee,\" she explained. \"We'd call that 'eat sure 'nuf. W e'd take som ething ready to eat to a playhouse. So we'd eat sure 'nuf.\" Children often accom panied parents when they fished, trad ed, or visited. The son of a freight boat captain used to sail with his father at every opport unity. \"To a kid, that's very interesting, going to all these ports up river. My father m ade m e watch him do everything.\" Children he lped adults make f ishing nets f rom twine, inc luding Lottie W illiam s of Avon who made nets \"from the tim e she was a young girl. E ven right before she died she still did it just to have som ething to do.\" Quilting was another po pular pas time. 183 7.4.7. Medical Care When one resident was seven years old, in 1905, she contracted the whooping cough. Her fa mily bundled her up in a horse and cart an d took her from the Litt le Kinnakeet station north of Avon to a Dr. Davis in Buxton. \"They didn't have shots in them days,\" she reported, but she was given patent m edicine . Stores sold laudanum , a popular drug for wom en. \"Back in the old days they used to say these old wo men we re floating around the road\" on laudanum . Paregoric was also com mon. \"My mother used to rub m y gum s in it when I was a kid. No wonder the kids was happy.\" \"Chill Tonic\" was taken in \"the fall of the year, and it was supposed to keep you from getting co lds.\" Asaf etida was purchased as well. \"All the k ids around here had worm s,\" said a villager. \"W e didn't have enough vegetables.\" The children were given \"wor m drops.\" \"I've heard m y mother say that old people woul d chew willow bark,\" said a f isherman, explaining tha t aspirin is m ade from willow trees. An elderly wom an had a brother who died of the flu, and a sister who died of \"som e kind of disease that was going around.\" S he learned the recipe for cough m edicine from a villager: He told m e, \"Two spoonfuls of honey, two s poonfuls of bourbon and a spoonful of lem on juice.\" I said, \" Well what is bourbon? \" He said \"For God's sakes, Ruby, don't you know what bourbon is? It's whiskey.\" Th at was good, good, stuff, I'm telling you one thing. Villagers began seeking her out for h er hom emade cough m edicine. Different ones would say they had a cough. I fixed so m uch of that cough medicine, and give it to one of their child ren to take to their m other if (she) had the cough, or give it to the m other to take to their children. T he last lady, she died, not too long ago, she told m e, \"There's one thing that I wouldn't do without in m y home, and that is that w hiskey, honey, and lem on juice.\" The old people picked leaves off the mullein bush ( Verbascum thapsus ) and wrapped a sprained ank le with them. A m an recalled b reaking his leg w hen he was 12 years old; the Navy pharm acist placed a splint on it m ade from a shingl e, and th ree days later his paren ts took him to 184 Elizabeth City for a cas t. \"He put a cloth on m y face spread with ether to put m e asleep to put that cast on.\" The debilitated boy m oved to a fi rst floor bedroom when they returned to Avon, and that m orning the house caught fire and he ha d to jum p out the window headfirst. In the 1930's it was not unusual to see \"som ebody with their arm in a sling from old Fords, [the starting crank] kicked back on people.\" 7.4.7.1. Omi Meekins, Midw ife Mary Gray explained that her m other, Le ona \"Om i\" Meekins, the wife of a Coast Guardsm en, was com pelled to becom e a \"Jack of All Trades\" due to the frequent absence of her husband. Her skills included adm inistering m edical care to v illagers and teach ing at the old Kinnakeet S chool in the 1910s and 1920s. \"She was the community nurse. She was a teacher awhile. She pulled all the kids teeth and cut their hair. Ev erybody that had a problem would come to her.\" Kinnakeeters called on \"Miss Om i,\" who had so me training in nursing from St. Vincent's hospital in Norfolk, for \"anythi ng but operating.\" Her rem edies included \"putting m elted butter- British o il- in your ears. \" She and others would make a poultice \"out o f the m ullein leaf plant\" for aches an d sores. To othaches were treated with hot pepper vinegar to dull th e pain . She treated people for whooping cough, sore thro ats, m easles, and other ailm ents. Omi Meekins she was most known for her work as the village m idwife, delivering \"m ore than a 100 babies.\" Mary Gray recalled her m other's \"big brown bag\" fu ll of m idwife tools and birth records. \"She had to send a copy of ever y birth to Raleigh and th en she'd keep the stub - she'd have to f ill out the mother's na me, the f ather, and whether it was a m ale or f emale.\" She 185 charged $10 or $15 dollars for \"several days of care.\" Midwives typical ly \"stayed until [the mother] got on her feet.\" A Kinnakeet wom an had Om i Meekins deliver one her babies, and m idwife Annie Meekins another in the 1930s. Afte r giving birth at hom e, she hired a girl to stay with her and assist for two dollars a week. Her third ch ild w as delivered by Dr. Hornstein in Buxton. I went down there for a checkup, and it was abou t a m onth before she was supposed to be born, and he said to m e, \"How woul d you like to have your baby born tonight? \" I said, well, I ain't sick, so he sent m e back hom e. My husband took m e back the next day and I had Cheryl. I think he must have forced labo r. He wanted to go som ewheres is what it was, that wh at we accus ed him of. Her m istrust of the physician was in contrast to the faith villagers had for Om i Meekins. The midwife died one m onth short of her 100th birthday. A female physician named Dr. Stet moved to Hatteras Village and vi sited the villages via \"a broken down autom obile or a horse and cart.\" After her \"reign there was other doctors m oved in,\" a villag er explained . \"Things b egan to improve. But, until I was 16 years old [in 1932], medical care down this way was terrible.\" Kinn remem ber Dr. Kenfield and There was also a \"hospital corpsm an\" stationed at the Navy base in Buxton who could be called for em ergencies, but he was \"an enlisted m an with no form al training hardly.\" The Navy would send a seaplane to transport patient s in dire em ergencies, such as a w oman with a difficult labor. But just getting a patient from Avon to the plane was a trial. \"Take the m other who was in labor in a horse and cart or a car, ta ke her down there and put he r in a skiff, take her out to the airplane, fly her to Norfolk or Elizabeth City. I know there's people who died under those conditions.\" An outbreak of typhoid fever cam e to the island in the early 20th centu ry. One f amily in Avon experienced the deadly disease. \"They had two children die of typhoid fever, and I 186 remember seeing those kids. They lost all their ha ir. Had no m edical care. They just stayed in the old house up there and died.\" The village had no dentists, and villagers with serious dental problem s would either go to an of f-island site su ch as Elizab eth City, or wait for the traveling dentis t. The trave ling dentis ts had foot-pedal drills, and would come in on the m ail boat. A m an explained that he had to have two m olars pulled when he left for boarding sch ool in Elizabeth City because on the island his teeth \"had b een neglected.\" Som e villagers s ought Om i Meekins to pu ll their teeth, o r anyone else with the proper tools. A few people were so ught out as dentists not because they had special skill in teeth pulling, bu t because th ey had pliers. \"Mr. David O'Neal up at the no rth end of the village, he had a special pair of pliers and people would go to him to pull their teeth with no anesthe tic.\" 7.4.8. Early Transportation The old sand roads were m ade from people wa lking or driving horses or horses and carts. \"We didn't have any buggies that I can rem ember. It was just a regula r flatbedded cart hooked up to one horse.\" The first cars m ore or less fo llowed the same paths, \"fighting the sand\" and devising ways to avoid mud holes. Boats were a prim ary mode of transportati on before roads were paved and the Oregon Inlet Bridge was built. E ach fam ily had thei r own sail sk iffs, and could recognize each other from a distance by the particular cut of boat a nd sail. An elderly Avon resident had been bedridden fo r three m onths. The day before he died in 1927, he am azed the household by springing out of bed to announce that he had seen his son's sail out of the upstairs window. My grandfather hollered to m y mother, \"Her e comes Loran, there's h is sail!\" Now, he hadn't been out of bed in three m onths. My mother said she looked and here he com es 187 down the stairs. He had put on clean clothes. They went dow n to m eet my father. The next m orning he was dead in his bed. It was, was adrenaline, I guess. Bankers were able to secure transportati on on freight and m ail boats. The old Avon post office was located near the sound, unlike the m odern office on Highway 12, because it afforded easier access to the m ail boat r unning from Manteo to Hatteras . The m ail boat was \"26 or 28, 30 feet long with a long cabin all the way back wher e passengers and freight we re kept.\" He said that a ll passengers rod e the m ail boat, as did the \"drumm ers\" or salesm en who would stop to take orders. The freight boat would later deliver those orders. In Avon, because of the swa mpy eastern side , lack of docks, and shallow waters, th e mail and freight boats would anchor two hundred ya rds offshore and offload into a sm aller boat. An old m an with a shoving skiff, a skiff pr opelled by a pole or an oar, w ould push out, board the m ail boa t while she's d rifting a littl e bit, and unload passe ngers and freight and mail. He had an old horse nam ed Charlie and an old cart, and if the tide was low he would just take his old horse a nd wade out in the water and back the cart up to the skiff. The sm aller sail sk iffs were typ ically tied to st akes in creeks, or pul led ashore. Islanders regularly turned the skiffs over and cleaned the hu ll. \"My father would ha ul it out and scrub the bottom with sand on a ra g. Let it d ry. One little nick in it, and he would ha ve to pa int it, all the time.\" An old-tim er recalled the very first ca r on Hatteras Island around 1918. \"A m an to Hatteras [village] had it, Ellsworth B urrus. And, he com e up here on Sunday and takes out people for fifty cent a head to ride into it. That w as like an airplane then.\" 7.4.9. Postal Service The Kinnakeet Post Office opened in 1873, repr esenting a halfway point in the route to Hatter as village. Dam on G. Meekins was the f irst postm aster. Ten years later the nam e was 188 changed to Avon Post Office. The post office was tiny, described as being the size of an outhouse with ragged boards and crooked steps. \"Y ou'd have to turn sideways to get out - you'd go in and get your m ail [from the postm aster's window] - it The \"whole village\" gathered at Bennie's Land ing each da y, \"kids jum ping up and down\", waiting for the whistle to blow and the m ail boat to arriv e: Mr. Tom would wade out in the water and br ing the bags of m ail in, or bring the one letter in m ore than likely. He brought the freight and doled it around and we would all watch it, the n wait f or Mr. Charlie to overh aul the m ail. Oh gosh, we wouldn't have missed it for nothing. \"Mr. Charlie \" was Charlie W illiam s, postm aster, state leg islator, and f ather of the m an who wrote a book entitled, The Kinnakeeter . Today, in 2004, old -timers still ask Avon postal workers if the m ail is \"hauled ove r yet.\" 7.4.10. Early Trade Before the windm ills disappeared in the ea rly tw entieth cen tury, Avon boats would cross the sound carrying oysters, salted spot and m ullet, and other fish depending on the season, and return with corn and wheat from plantations around Stum py Point; this grain would be ground at the village m ill. They traded for a n umber of other products such as sorghum molasses and salt pork. A village wom an declared that \"in them days there was nothing nobody done\" as far as regular jobs. \"The m en fished, th at was their livin g.\" It app ears Avon had the firs t mills on Hatteras Island, including Barnes Mill, located on the sound side in the village (Payne 1985). Avon villag ers grew wh at produce they could, b ut until abou t 1947 canned goods, lumber, and other m aterials cam e by freight boat. Som e of the sail-operated vessels that ran from the Outer Banks to Elizabe th City inc luded the Julia Be ll, operated by W alker Scarborough, and the Missouri , run by Avon resident Loran O'Neal. 189 7.4.10.1 . Loran O'Neal, Freight Boat Captain (Born 1897, Died 1961) The Misso uri was a 56 foot-long two- masted saili ng sharpie that was shallow-drafted for sound waters. Th e juniper ves sel was built in Smyrna, a village in Carteret County on Core Sound. Its bottom was red, the hull was green, and the decking was buff. A shallow draft was especially important when the ve ssel was loaded with cargo. It had three sails: jib, m ainsail, and a sail on the stern. To prevent leeway, or sideways drift, the Missouri had a large centerboard. It had m etal-fram ed canvas bunks. There was a woods tove on board for cooking and warm th. It was rigged with a large block a nd tackle for heavy cargo. T he Missou ri \"weren't beautiful, but it done its job. It fed people.\" Captain Loran O'Neal worked with one crew member, but often carri ed his little boy as well. He also ran a bugeye, or a cross-planke d V-bottom sailing vessel with two m asts, called the Duncan. This vessel, built in the Chesapeake Bay region in 1886, proved a bit too deep- drafted for the shoals and shallows of Pa mlico Sound. One night a freak March blizzard blew it ashore at Buxton. The captain's son L.P. O' Neal (Figures 7.4.6. and 7.) explained what happened when his parents and grandfather were anchored in the sound in the spring of 1937. My grandfather got daddy up and said, \"L oran, you better com e up here there's something not right.\" D addy said he got up a nd you could hear a roaring. From the tim e he got shoes on, the boat lurched, broke the an chor chain, and broke the forward m ast out of it. A blizzard! She w ent right across the southern reef...to Buxton. There wasn't nothing there then but a m arsh. The bowsprit went right up ...in the sand. My m other walked off of that. Three m onths later Captain O'Neal, using the \"b edways and rollers\" t echnique, got the vessel back in th e water. The Duncan was eventually scuttled in Pam lico Sound: The wor ms got her and she wasn't worth fixi ng. They towed her out to the edge of the channel, poured gas inside of her, set her on fire, and she burnt and sunk out there. I saw it with m y fish finder, saw that l ittle rib sticking up out of the sand. 190 Figure 7.4.6. L.P. O'Neal Working on Model of Father's Freight Boat. P hoto by B. Garrity-Blake 191 Figure 7.4.7. L.P. O'Neal and Garden, Avon. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. Before running freight, C aptain O'Neal, descri bed by his son as a \"short little guy\" who received kisses on his bald head from a m uch taller wife, operated a barge in the early 1920s, transporting iron ore to B angor, Maine. His ne w bride Ida Mae and father George Howard accom panied him ; Ida Mae cooked for the crew of a half dozen m en. She brought h er first-born child aboard in 1924, and in 1927 they stopped r unning ore and purchased the freight boat from Avon resident Charlie W illiam s. Captain O'Neal had a Coca-Cola franchise, and along with general freight distributed Cokes or \"dopes\" throughout the island, as well as NuGrape soda pop, RC Cola, Nehi and Double Cola: They called \"cokes\" dopes back in those days . Coca-cola had cocaine in it up until 1937. We used to have a great big garage like a warehouse, and it was always stacked with drinks and things. He hauled freight, to mbstones, and lum ber, whatever anybody wanted he'd haul it. His wife collected m oney from island stores, often with children in tow. \"She didn't take no bull off nobody,\" attested her son. He claim ed that she never had trouble collecting from 192 Chicam acom ico accounts, but Buxton and Frisco wa s another story. \"One tim e I went with m y mother to go down and collect, this guy ran out of the backdoor of the store. My m other saw him and hollered, com e on.\" Ida Mae O'Neal was greatly respected by her fa mily for her hard work, as expressed by her son: I've heard certain people say that wom en were second-class citizens back in them days. No, they weren't second-class citizens; they loved their fam ily. I went to church one time, and I heard this wom an say that in Sunday school class I got up and left. All I could see w as my mother's red hands where sh e was washing m e and my sister's clo thes out there by hand on the washboard. Captain Loran O'Neal's route went f rom Avon to Elizabeth City, where he'd pick up freight. It took the Missouri one day to get there, and the crew would work late into the night loading cargo. The next morning they would set sail for Hatteras Island. The vessel had a \"little donkey boat with a little one-cylinder engine in it\" that they would use to tow the [the Missouri ] down river u ntil reach ing the sound. \"You got th e turn ing bu oy, and then you would hoist th e little boat up on the stern, and th en you'd set the sails and sail down.\" The crew gathered water by dropping a bucket overboard \"out of Elizabet h City around the buoy and that water tasted sweet.\" W ater was stored in an old whiskey barrel with a burned-out inte rior. His son recalled a time when his father fell \"asleep at the wheel\" after a long night of loading freight, and plowed into a f isherman upriver: My father was com ing through Allig ator River early in th e morning. They 'd been up there through Outfall Canal, picked up a load of lum ber. He said he heard som ebody cussing, and he looked there weren't a guy with him. They had run in a pound net, and the guy was fishing his nets. He'd run the freight boat right in guy's pound net stakes. When Captain O'Neal reached Hatteras Island, he stopped in Rodanthe, Buxton, and Hatteras, finally returning to A von late that day. \"Going up we w ould have beef hash and corn fritte rs,\" rec alled h is son , who often accom panied his father. \"Com ing back we would have the 193 same thing with string beans and corn in it, so it was m ore like a soup, and s till have corn bread.\" Sometimes the capta in baked biscu its and oyste r fritters. The freight boats transported lum ber to Ne w Inlet at Pea Island when a new bridge was getting constructed over the sto rm-cut channel: They'd go up out Fall C anal over here and bring back a load of lum ber and five gallons of corn whiskey each trip. It was made up there around Out Fall Canal and Colum bia. They had all those workers building the bridge . They'd take a little sip every once in awhile I im agine. The freight boat cap tain transp orted passengers free of char ge. Passengers experienced the vessels by sail until the late 1930s when gas e ngines were installed. C aptain O'Neal installed two straight-eight Bu ick engines in 1939: I rem ember folks around here who used to cr ank engines with thei r feet. They would turn the key off, turn the engine over, get the crank up, turn the key on, and push the crank down. It was a dangerous thing. My fa ther got slammed against the side of the engine cab in many a times because the engine w ould kick back. He had a gouge righ t through his nose. When \"gas boats\" began replacing sail skiffs in the early 1920s, gas was ten to twelve cents per gallon. Most profitable for Captain O'Neal were the governm ent contracts during the Depression to haul coal to Coast Guard stations. The Missouri finally m et her dem ise in the 1944 storm after washing across the island to the ocean an d breaking in two. She broke the anchor chain, she went out to Mill Creek, went across the land, and the mast took the telegraph lines down. She went to sea and broke in half. T he bow was up around little Kinnakeet C oast Guard station on the beach, and the stern wen t down to Creeds Hill just north of Hatteras. A m an to Hatteras asked my father if he could have the engines and shaft and daddy give it to him . Although Captain O'Neal quit running the freigh t boat after the Missouri was destroyed, the completion of Highway 12 on Hatteras Island in 1950 brought about the end of the freight boat business as a whole. Captain O' Neal finished out his life comme rcial fishing, after converting a 194 cabin boat used for hunting guides, the L.P. Jr ., into a little tr awler. He died at age 64 one Septem ber after catching a 47 pound red drum off the beach. My m other told him , \"Loren you don't need to go today\". S he said he w as gray looking, his skin. He said, \"Yeah, I'm going.\" He we nt up there, put his line out, caught one 47 pound (red drum ), brought it back up, put it in the truck, and f ell dead on the beach. H e told m e plenty of tim es when I go, I'm going over there. A Coast Guard supply boat called the \"AB 21\" ran freight and supplies from Elizabeth City to Coast Guard stations along the coast. Revenue officers comm issioned the boat to take them to bootleg hotspots such as East Lake a nd Mann's Harbor where corn whiskey was m ade. Captain Obie, who Manson Meekins was boarding with in Elizabeth City while he a ttended school, ran the vessel. Meekins relayed a hum orous story that involved Loran O'Neal. One evening I saw m en unloading five-gallon jugs of corn whiskey that they had captured down around East Lake. Mr. Obie said, \"My God Manson, get you a jar.\" So I got a quart jar and he took th e plug out of one of those five gallon jugs and dum ped m e a quart of whisky. I really didn't drink so I took that jar and w ent out in the back yard to a huge circle of lilies and sat th at quart ja r down in to the m iddle of those lily pads. A few days later, Meekins m et the frei ght boat run by Loran O'Neal of Avon. I went down to visit [O'Neal], find out how things were going down in Avon. And I said, \"Loran, would you like to have a quart of whiskey? \" And he was quite jubilant. I gave it to him aboard that boat. And the ne xt tim e I saw Loran, I said, \"How was that whiskey I gave you?\" He said, \"My God, Manson, it alm ost killed all of us! It m ade us all sick!\" Avon was known for boat building. An early boat builder w as Farrow S carborough, and a more recent build er was Willie Austin who sold boats by the foot. Austin, like a ll the traditional boat builders, kept his calculations \"a ll in his h ead\" rath er than in boat p lans. When old-tim e builders did sketch out a figure, it wa s typically in pencil on a scrap of wood or on the shed wall. He built sm aller boats th an his pred ecessors, f rom skiffs to forty-f ooters. He obtaine d his lum ber from Elizabeth City. One of his ski ffs sits on land before a set of rental cottages today, in 2004, with \"Avon Cottages\" painted on it. 195 [Austin] built sailboats, little m otorboats, and stuff like that. He was good at it. One day we could see m y father's sails off the back porch. My m other took m e down to the landing whe n I was six y ears old. W illy Au stin had built m e a sailboat to wed by m y father and, about part of the way in, my father turned it loose, and let it sail in towards the shore. My mother said \"I couldn't even hold you. You got in the boat and headed right into the sound.\" One long-term resident talked about the cedar trees in A von and how that sustained the boat building trade. Builders used \"a hamm er, hatchet, a plane, and for sand paper they would take a rag, dip it in the w ater, and put sand on it, \" or use \"wet leather w ith sand on it.\" Planks were cut with saws and the keel was shaped with an adze. Th ey steam ed and bent fram es with a block and tackle. 7.4.10.2. The Eel Grass Industry In 1912 postm aster C.T. W illiam s II of Kinnak eet started a seaweed harvesting bus iness, after the discovery of a neighbor led to a way to m arket the endl ess rafts of eelgrass drifting in Pamlico Sound. A neighbor, walking along the docks in No rfolk, happened to see a num ber of bales of...seaweed known as eel grass. Since eel gr ass grew in great profusion in Pam lico Sound...W illiam 's neigh bor copied d own the nam e and address on the b ales...W illiam s immediately wrote to C.T. W inchester in Ba ltimore, asking what the baled eel grass was used for, what W inchester paid for it...Eel grass, the Baltim ore buyer said, was used as packing in the m anufacture of m attresses and stuffed furniture, and it was also used f or putting the final polish on fine wooden furnitu re. Further, the dem and fa r exceeded the supply... (Stick 1958, 233). William s employed 30 to 40 Kinna keete rs to ha rvest, d ry, and bale se aweed. Crews collected great rafts of the eelgr ass, known locally as \"sea oars\" or \"sea horse,\" in sound waters from Avon t o Buxton on flat barges. W illiam s bought the barge and oth er equipm ent, and Farrow Scarborough ran the business. Villagers als o collected mounds of the grass that broke loose and blew to shore each 196 June, and spread it out on drying racks in the sun. \"It breaks loose from the reef every June and gets asho re,\" explained a resid ent. \"God Al mighty, it g ets rotten - it will turn your ho use black. \" Crews turned the drying eelgrass with pitchf orks. Once dry, the grass was taken to a building \"south of the post office landing\" and baled with a \"seale r-baler.\" \"It was a compression unit which put that seaweed in a bale , maybe four or five feet long and m aybe two feet high an d two feet wide,\" recalled a villag er. \"And they would pr ess it down with a hard presser and put [baling] wire around it, put [the bales] back on thei r flats, take it on freight boats to places like Elizabeth City.\" Another m ethod would be to em ploy a boy to \"jum p up and down on the gras s until it was tightly p acked\" (Dunbar 1956, 136). Some four addition al villagers established seawe ed business es in the area as well. Farrow Scarborough was in the bus iness, and bu ilt his own s eaweed baler w ith parts ordered at an iron foundry in Elizabeth City. He owned the 54-foot freight schooner Julia Bell , on which he transpo rted seaweed bails to Elizabeth City and returned with general m erchandise for island stores (Hooper 1983). Tom Gray a nd Fields Meekins each em ploye d about 10 villagers as well (Stick 1958). The increased ha rvest of seaweed was a blessi ng for the community - not only because of the incom e it generated, but becaus e there was a use for the eel gras s that otherwise rotted at Avon's shore. A seaweed blight know n as wasting disease de stroyed this already declining industry around 1930; lack of grass also destroyed the bay scallop fishery and caused waterf owl, e specia lly brant (Bran ta bernicla hro ta) to starve, in turn crippling the sport guiding business (Stick 1958, 232-233). 7.4.11. Commerc ial Fis hing Oysters were a significant part of the fishing industry from the m id-19th century to th e early 20th. A m an traced his ancestry back to his gr eat, great, great grandfather, who had two 197 Pamlico Sound schooners called the Resolute and the Worthington . \"During the Civil W ar they got fired on from the ocean side because they didn't know whether it was Confederate boats or not - they w ere fishing boats. Here they didn't want to side w ith either one.\" An old-tim er remembered two large sailing schooners in Avon that were used to harvest and transport oysters. [The schooner captains] would leave here in the fall during oyst er season and go over around Stumpy Point or Mann's Harbor or acro ss the sound gathering oysters which they would take to Elizabeth City and sell. My wife's grandfather, Mr. W arren Davis O'Neal, he and his brothers operated one called the Margaret Anne . As there was no harbor in Avon until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dug a T-shaped one in 1947, vessels \"were anchored or m oored to stakes\" along the soundside shore. The freight boat Missou ri was ancho red off Avon or on the b ackside of Big Island near Mill Creek. Although most shipwrecks along th e Outer Banks are assum ed to be alon g the ocean side, it was typical for soundside vessels to wash as hore or sink during bad storm s as well. During real severe storm s vessels would break their m oorings and wash ashore. The Missouri washed ashore during a storm near Buxton. The bugeye Duncan washed in n ear shore where she floundered and was destroyed. The Margaret Anne went ashore up north of Avon. That was a two-m asted schooner. [People] would eventually get them off but, over tim e, the storm s and stuff would contribute to their dem ise. Most of the Avon fisherm en worked sm all sail skiffs. \"You took your sail wrapped around your m ast and wa de it out to your skiff, step the m ast, unfurl the sail,\" explained a villager. \"It was a triangular sa il called a sprit sail. A sprit is a long pole that ran from the foot of the m ast near th e boat's seat up at an angle which pushed the clew (the corner of the sail) way up so the wind would catch it.\" Also there was \"a jib - a trian gular little s ail up in f ront of the boat. It ran from the m ast forward where the m ain sail ran from the m ast aft\" (Figure 7.4.8). The sail skiffs rarely capsized unde r such able sailors. \"For ba lance they had bags of sand. When it was blowing hard and they were running side to, they would shift the sand bag over to the high side to keep the boat more on an even keel.\" 198 Figure 7.4.8. Traditional Sail Skiff. Illustration by Manson Meekins. Fisherm en would typically set gill nets in th e evening by fixing ten or fifteen nets to a stake in Pamlico Sound. They woul d stay with the nets all night, fishing them and preventing crabs from eating their catch. \"And all during the m orning hours just after daylight, you'd see them com ing in their sailboats, sail skiffs.\" Some fisherm en worked in dayl ight hours \"hauling\" in crews of three. \"They'd take this net out and run it out into the little gulleys and sloughs and pull it up on the shore and scoop up 199 fish.\" Six or eight long haul crews worked out of Avon thr ough the 1970s. Half were crews from Kitty Hawk and Colling ton, who would sleep on their b oats all week and drive hom e in cars for the weekend. Crews were usually m ade up of four men. Today, in 2004, only one long haul crew works out of Avon. Fisherm en also worked pound nets, \"which are fish weirs or traps set out in the sound where they have these long stationary lead ne ts. The fish follow along the lead and becom e entrapp ed into the weirs. \" Fisherm en sought a variety of fish including shad, trout, flounder, m ackerel, spot and croaker. \"In the old days croakers wouldn't br ing but about a cent a pound. Now, croakers are one of the most expens ive fish. I th ink it's b ecaus e they keep well and exp ort them to Japan.\" Villagers ate what they could not sell, and fish was on the m enu every day : \"When you walked down the road in the evening and go by people's houses you could sm ell fish frying alm ost all the tim e.\" My favorite is boiled fish. You boil it in salt water, you boil potatoes, you take your f ish out, put a p iece of fish on your plate, kind of chop it up a little bit, you pu t potatoes, then you take a handful of diced up onions and put on top of it. You then take the salt pork drippings, just cook a little pie ce of salt pork and use cooking o il. Then you pour that all over that, and put black pepper on top of it a nd have baked corn bread. Oh, m y God! In the late 1920s there w as an unusual abunda nce of speckled trout in the sound. \"There was a m an here knocking them with a hamm er. They were getting fifteen cent a pound - unheard of a t that time.\" Village rs rarely so ld fis h to each o ther, but sha red the ca tch: \"They'd always give you fish. We always do now. You don't go down and buy fish off of people. They give them to you.\" Wom en and children collected oys ters, scallops, clam s, and \"m an's noses,\" or soft clam s, as well. \"Man's noses w ere in a long shell. People used to boil them .\" Even in the early 20th 200 century, som e people held \"shellfis h leases, \" a tacit, inform al ag reement, sim ilar to \" squatter's rights,\" in w hich a fisherm an's established she llfish collecting area was respected and regard ed by the community as \"belonging\" to him . My aunt took us down to the sound to dig clam s. She had a \"saw sack,\" they called them . It was a brown sack. And she was filling it up. We was going around feeling for clam s. By and by, we heard som ebody on t he shore side say, \"Get out of m y clam bed!\" Com e to find out she was in som ebody's clam bed. An d, all that tim e, there com e a hole in her bag and she was losing the clam s! Islanders were not inclined to waste resources, and usually consum ed, traded, or sold everything they harvested. \"People would get wh at they wanted; they didn't didn't waste stuff.\" They enjoyed hogfish, m ullet, and spot - the spots were cut open, cleaned, salted, and hung on the line to dry. A wom an remarked that she liked ev ery sort of fish but bluefish, because it gave her \"th e sparkle eye.\" \"When I'd eat a piece of bluefish,\" she explained mysteriously, \"the sparkles woul d come in m y eye.\" Childre n enjoyed wading out to the channel to catch big crabs or \"ch annelers\" with a dip net. An Avon old-tim er pointed out that Septem ber of 1957 marked the beginning of crab potting on H atteras Island, and he was am ong the fi rst use this type of trap. Before then, crabbers used trotlines - long lin es that were ba ited in several places and then slowly p ulled in. Pots, invented in Maryland, were available from a man in W anchese for two dollars apiece. Village rs in Chicam acom ico were the f irst to try. \"W e found out two m en in Salvo has got something to catch crabs. So, we went up there to find out about it. They said, 'W e've got to go to W anchese and take our crabs. W e can bring you back 20 pots.'\" They got bait (m enhaden) from pound net fisherm en and set the pots off Av on the next day to skeptical rem arks from villagers. \"George Gray looked at the pot s and said, 'W hat are you going to do, catch mockingbirds with those traps?'\" 201 By one o'clock they had all 20 set, and anxi ously returned to the first pots to see how they had done. We couldn't hardly lift the pot up because it was so full of crabs. From ten pots we filled a big fish box full of jimmy crabs and they were only set for th ree hours. What a surprise! Before then all anybody'd do was ta ke a dip net and get just enough crabs to eat. That's what star ted crabbing down here. Fish dealer George Gray, who had m ade fun of the pots, eventually began furnishing crabbers with bait and paying four cents a pou nd for the crabs. The wo rd got out, and fisherm en from villages south began using crab pots as well. \"They found out about it in B uxton. They cam e up here investigating. They hadn't seen any pots ei ther. They began to get them in Hatteras and spread it on to Ocracoke.\" Through the 1960s the network of people who supported com mercial fishing included the men, wom en, and children who m ade fishing nets. \"I never bought a net in m y life,\" reported a fisherm an, who worked with both c otton and m ultifilament. \"I hang m y own nets. As a m atter of fact m y son is using my nets now.\" W omen sewed nets outside and inside their hom es throughout the winter and som etimes into the eveni ng. Instead of lead weights, m en used to dip the end of a \"fly tail\" ne t into tar and then in to sand in order to create bottom weight or a \"lead line.\" \"It h eld the bo ttom of the net down, anchor it to the bottom , and they would always stick a stake, a little yaupon stick, and tie the net to it.\" Cotton nets were dipped in a lim e solution each week. \"Everybody had a lim e barrel along the shor e. You had to hang them up and dry them because co tton nets would rot.\" Some m en fished with lin en nets, which w as finer th an cotton but stronger. \"Those caught ,\" recalled a fisherm an, \"M y God they caught.\" Before the harbor was dug, the Pam lico wate rs off Avon's shore were dotted with stilt houses in w ater deep enough for freight boats to offload their cargo. Th e freight boats would also pick up iced fish and deliv er it to Elizabeth City. Earl y stilted houses were run by Watson 202 Gray and Harris Miller (W illiam s 1975) and were landm arks for Avon long after they fell into disuse. Each house had \"a big hole in the floor , and the little boat would go under the fish house,\" explained a Kinnakeeter. \"T hey would drop a basket down, put the fish in it, and pull it up.\" A buy-boat collected the fish from the variou s houses. By the 1930s with the availability of ice, buy-boat captains \"would ice the fish and carry them to Rodanthe\" to load on a boat bound for Globe Fish com pany in Elizabeth City. C.C. \"Clemm ie\" Gray had an ice house, set out in the four foot-deep channel about 500 yards offs hore in Pa mlico Sound (Figure 7.4.9). Three hundred pound blocks of ice were hauled up to th e stilted house by block and tackle; the ice was stored on the north side of the house in wood shav ings, while fish was iced and packed in the south end. Two large oil barrels at the ice hous e were filled with kerosene and gasoline, which was pum ped via underw ater pipes to m ainland Kinna keet and sold to villagers for a variety of uses. The ice house was eventually destroyed in a storm and Clemm ie Gray built a new fish house at the harbor, later operated by his son Geo rge. Clemm ie Gray also built a fish h ouse in th e North'ard section of Kinnakeet. Other fish house owners incl uded Edward Scarborough, Sum ner Scarborough, and Fields Meekins. T oday, in 2004, Avon Seafood is the only fish house in Avon, and one of two companies on all of Hatteras Island (Figures 7.4.10-11). 203 Figure 7.4.9. C.C. \"Clemmie\" Gray's Fish and I ce House.

Hunting In the early 1900s Kinnakeet, like several ot her Outer Banks locations, w as considered prim e waterfowl territory. Comm ercial and s port hunters traveled from New York, Baltim ore, and Philadelphia to take advantage of the raft s of waterfowl that wintered over in Pam lico Sound. To accommodate this m arket, Kinnakeet old-tim ers carved decoys out of shipwreck debris and other discarded m aterial (Wechter 1975). Much of the waterfowl hunting occurred in the sound, but villagers also hunted shore birds for food. Curlews and sandpipers were am ong t hose that islanders frie d or stew ed with pie bread. Duck, goose, an d brant hun ting thriv ed in Pamlico Sound until the m id-1930s when 206 wasting disease killed of f the eelgrass, a prim ary source of food for waterfowl. The eelgrass did not com e back until the late 1940s, and this period was m arked by a sharp reduction in waterfowl. Manson Meekins rem embered bran t washing ashore dead, and geese sickly or \"poor.\" You could see those flocks of geese, m aybe 50 or 60 in a flock, picking any kind of grass they could find, eating sand spur s or anything. A nd they were so poor physically. W e would run downwind on them , and som e of th em just couldn't get off the ground. W e put them in our [waterfowl impoundm ent] to try to get them to grow, regain their health. A \"Yankee sportsm an,\" as villagers called hi m, had a cottage in Avon, and frequented the area to enjoy his \"one m an hunting club.\" He had several boats. He had m en from the v illage take c are of the decoy s, paint the m up, keep his boat repaired. He'd come down in the fall of the year during the duck hunting season and bring his lady friend. He would go [hunting] alm ost every day - guides from the village would ta ke him out to the reef, tie him out, put him in his blind, his hunting box, and they would take sail sk iffs and sail up and down rallying fowl, scaring them up, so they would fly into the hunter. The villager s would stan d on Mill L anding hill , the \"highes t prom ontory that we had, \" and keep a lookout for the hunters. They w ould m eet the \"Yankee sportsm an\" and any companions he had at day's end to w atch the m en divide the take in an interesting m ethod that ensured fairness: One m an turned his back to the piles of duck and, without looking, would declare who got what pile as the portions were called out: The village would try to go dow n to the shore about dark and m eet the hunters. [The hunters] would anchor the decoy skiff and bring the fowl in and put them on the shore. If he had three fellows hunting with him that da y, they would pile the wildf owl in three piles. They'd divide them so m any ducks, so many brant. T hen the one guy would turn his back. O ne of the other would say, \" Who has this pile? \" And the guy looking westward would say, \"Y ou take it.\" \" Well, who has this next pile?\" The guy says, \"Joe takes it.\" A nd that would leave him with a pile. Sometimes the sportsm en had so m any ducks that they would sell a portion to villagers: The villagers would buy what they could afford of the geese and the ducks and the brant. Geese sold for about sixty cents apiece and fo r two brant it was about sixty cents. Ducks 207 were about twenty, twenty-five cen ts apiece d epending on the species, wh ether it was a pintail or widgeon or a redhead. Other \"sports,\" or hunters wishing to be taken out by local guides, included Reverend Paxton, who would come to Avon and \"shoot all week and preach on Su nday at th e Methodist church.\" Som e hunters kept tam e geese in the village and used them for decoys. Village boys would get \"a big kick out of going 'round and lo oking at their decoys or boats and all the expensive clothing and nice guns and things.\" Fr eight boat captain Loran O'Neal worked as a hunting guide as well; when the New York industria list that he assisted di ed, O'Neal was offered the m an's local house, land, and two boats fo r $1,200. \"He only had $400, so he bought the boat. The b oat was called the Brant . She was 30 feet long with a three cylinder Lathrop and a wood stove.\" Kinnakeeters also hunted, both comm ercially and for subsistence, until comm ercial hunting ceased upon passage of the Migr atory B ird Treaty A ct of 1918. In the winter, father hunted. He had his rig, had live decoys, geese. And he'd go out and tie them out in his blind, and com e in of the evening. And he'd ship his fowl [to Baltim ore and New York] in barre ls till they p assed [the Migr atory Bird Treaty Ac t of 1918]. Coul dn't m ake enough out of it to go ou t there, sp end all day hun ting, kill fowl, just to sell around to local people. Fowl that was shipped north was dressed in this fashion: \"What they do is take their guts out, shove a handful of salt down inside of them , and pack them in barrels.\" A resident's father brought waterfowl hom e to eat. Her mother woul d bake it, or stew it with rutabagas and pie bread (pie pastry); she \"didn't pu t all kinds of vegetabl es into it then. But it made a good stew.\" Village rs' decoys were not fancy, but fashi oned \"out of any piece of flotsam that would wash up on the beach.\" As they lacked cypre ss trees, m en would carve decoys from cypress fence posts that were imported to the island, or from discarded telephone poles from the old lifesaving station. They sim ply used a hatche t to cut the form s. At Mill L anding, Richard 208 Hooper kept a goose pound; the gees e would be brought to the hunting waters and tethered to the bottom with a line in ord er to keep th em in one place to attract other fowl. Hunting m ethods including the use of a \"l aydown battery,\" which was a coffin-shaped box fitting the contours of a hunter's body. It wa s bordered in decking, and designed to sink level with the waterline. \"If it floated too hi gh, they would put iron ducks around it...to float it down to the right h eight.\" A villag er explain ed that \"( laydo wn batter ies) were so ef fectiv e tha t ducks would com e right in over your head within three or four feet a nd sit right down in the decoys. You could see them com ing up and dow n wind. They'd fly in by m ass - it was just murder.\" Another m ethod involved a concrete, creoso te, or wooden cube or \"curtain box\" (also known as a sink box or cheese box) that was wate rtight and ringed with a wooden plate and gasket that h oused a \"can vas circular structure about three feet high.\" Guides would sink the box and secure it to the bottom with sandbags. Hunt ers clim bed in the box and raised the canvas as needed to stay low in the water while keep ing the subm erged box dry. The box was surrounded by floating latticework that help ed break rough water and prevent it from entering the box. This was called the \"wing\" o r \"sea b reaker.\" \"All yo u could see f rom a distance was just this m assive flock of [dec oy] ducks. It was a very effective m ethod,\" a Kinnakeeter recalled. Strict hunting restrictions passed in 1918 lim ited the am ount of waterfowl that could be shot, and outlawed the laydown battery and the si t-up battery (sim ilar to the laydown battery). The batteries were view ed as too effectiv e in sneaking up on fowl and \"unsportsm anlike.\" Villagers were cognizant and respectful of the new laws, but were isolated on the Ban ks and rarely saw a gam e warden at either the north'ard hunting gro the south'ard (Figures 7.4.12-13). 209 7.4.12. South'ard Grounds. Illustration Ma Meekins. 210 Figure 7.4.13. South of South'ard H unting Grounds. Illustration by Manson Meekins. 211 7.4.13. Livestock and Gardening Produce, \"if we had any, was m ostly grown.\" Villagers usually had gardens, and surfm en often grew vegetables at stations such as Little K innakeet. \"H e raised just about everything,\" said th e dau ghter of a Little ries.\" collards, and potatoes. An Avon old- timer felt that today' s gardens are not as successful, b ecause peop le \"stand an d spray\" in stead of soaking the roo ts with water p oured from a can. Families typ ically had milk cows; a v illager fondly recalled th at their cows were nam ed Levy and Brighty. One Avon fa mily trad ed property for a dairy cow: My father had a piece a land to Frisco and he traded that to a man to Hatteras f or this Jersey cow and calf. Brought her up here a nd m y mother would go out and m ilk her. She'd have a pan of soapy water and she'd go ou t there wash her teats and things off, and the calf would get on the other side and start to get another teat. My m other'd shove his head away u ntil sh e could get so m uch m ilk. While general sto res so metimes carried canne d milk, and occasionally p eople cou ld purchase butter, fam ily cows were an im portant source of dairy products. Kinnakeeters often m ade \"clabber,\" or soured m ilk curds used in preparing biscuits. [Mother] had a m ilk box, she had it on the porch and it was screened in and she'd put bowls of milk in ther e and let it clabber. She skimmed that cream off bright yellow. Take and beat it, and she som etimes she'd spri nkle salt into it, and it would m ake butter. She would m ake clabber biscuits. S he woul d take flour and baking powder and salt and a little b it a su gar. Fall and winter would bring hog and \"beef\" kil lings, where men cleaned, dressed, salted, and smoked shoulders and ham s. Hog intestines were tu rned inside out with a \"waterbush stick\" and cleaned in p reparation f or chitlin s. \"My m other'd cook them chitlin s. They'd sm ell the hous e all up, so she got so she took them in the outhouse and ha d a little a little kerosene stove in there that she'd fry them onto.\" 212 A man com e down here, he was transferred in the Coast Guard fro m New Jersey. He would buy a steer from som ebody. He'd kill it, dress it, and take it under the oak tree down there where he'd have the tables, and th en he would sell it for fifteen cent a pound for the steak. The stew stuff would be te n cent a pound. He had a pair of scales hanging on a tree. Everyone had a few chickens, and ate the m eat and eggs all year long. My m other had a coop out there that was a scr eened in and all, she'd put this chicken in there and feed her nothing but corn for three or four days before she killed her. Clean her out you know, of all the bugs and everything, becau se the chicken was th e nastiest thing. They'd eat anything. There were two windm ills operating in Avon until the early 20th centu ry, one in the southern part of the village at Zeb Miller's Landing and the other on the northern border at Farrow Scarborough's L anding. One of the m was right over here on the sound, which was used to grind grain that would be brought in by boat from across the sound, lik e corn and wheat. They ground the flour right here. The other w as up north of th e village, up from Mr. Farrow Scarborough's Landing. Som e of those old stones are still in evidence here in Avon. They're big stones, maybe four feet in diam eter, round, with gr ooves cut in them where the corn, as it ground, would exude and spill ov er the side. Outer Bankers were som etimes short of fres h greens, however, and this was cited as a cause for a high incidence of wor ms in childre n. The m ost common wild vegetation consum ed was yaupon leaves, as villagers regularly m ade and consum ed yaupon tea. A derogatory nam e used for Avon villagers in the late 1800s was \"yaupon-chopper,\" in reference to people who made the tra ditional tea. A well-kno wn taunt ca lled out du and Be Kind\" Sports Ac tivity Bus. P hoto by B. Garrity-Blake; Village rs owned f ree-ra nging cattle, horses, and sheep, and later k ept liv estock in pe ns. During bad snowstorm s, the free-roam ing horses w ould \"go get on these old store's porches to get out of the snow.\" From 1921-1926, as part of the U.S. Departm Agriculture's war agains t dise ase-c arrying ticks, live stock was rou nded up and dipped twice a m onth in a \"creosote mixture\" held in concrete vats. Villager Ernest Quidley led the roundups. Governm ent inspectors oversaw the process. \"They drug th em through that dipping vat. They'd swim through [a form ula] like Lysol m ixed in five-gallon livestock] would get in that drip pen, slan ted so that the liquid would run back in the vat.\" A m an painted the rum p of each 214 freshly dipped anim al with a da b of green paint, and a range ri der rode along the whole island in search of any anim al without the green m ark. Islanders finally gave up trying to dip th e wildest of the cattle, and accep ted the governm ent's bounty of five dollars p er head (M acNeill 1958 ). An old dipping vat remains in the village, and som e question if this vat m ay be linked to the present-day rate cancer: They'd take a cow up a ram p down through th at vat and m arch him out the other side. And DDT - they'd em pty the so lution, pull the plug a nd it would run right out in the sand. So you know it got in the water. That coul d be the reason the can cer rate is so high. Probably a dozen in Avon right now with it. An d that's a lot for a sm all village like that. 7.4.14. Perceptions of Environment and Storms \"There's always been som e men, old fisherm en, around that could look at the sky and tell what was going to happen [with the weather].\" If a hurrican e was com ing, villagers g ot as m uch as they could off the floor in preparation of flooding. People just felt like there was a storm com ing, an d finally it got there. When they left, everybody just went about their business. W ater com e up in the house, but the next day it was over. There was nothing it could hurt. May wash your house around a little bit. We didn't have anything. P eople t ook care of their house and pa rked their car on a hill. People were switching from wood fl oors to Congoleum in the 1930s, which som etimes had to be removed aft er flooding, but was not as troublesom e as present day hom es with carpeting. In recen t years Avon hom es were flooded in hurrican es Gloria (1 985) and Em ily (1993), but unlik e Hatteras Village and Rodanthe, were spar ed in Isabel (2003 ) and Alex (2004). Old tim ers recall when the beach was \"flat as a shield\" b efore the Depres sion-era dun e building began. Houses were built sturdy e nough where storm winds we re som etimes not audible fro m inside, although a villager recalled hearing \"water gurg ling under the house.\" The extrem e pelled ev eryone to be \"seafaring sailors.\" 215 \"There were dunes in them days,\" attested Captain O'Neal's son. \"W e used to stand on the front porch, and you could watch your breakers roll up on th e beach. There's a lot m ore vegetation n ow than there was then, because peo ple burned everyth ing back in them days in th eir stoves and stuff.\" \"When the sea was just a little rough,\" agreed Manson Meekin s, \"you could see the ocean waves ridin g in.\" He stressed the flatness of th e beach that was just \"w hite s and an d shells, and the frequent ocean overw ash.\" W ith the exception of som e large live o ak trees, m arsh grass, \"water bushes,\" yaupon and m yrtle bushes, he recal led little vegetation in Avon, and attributed this to bo th the saltwater overwash an d free-roam ing lives tock. Several tim es a year, the tide, the ocea n, would run over the beach. Com e on down through th e area, run through the villages, throug h the creeks. Kill m ost of the vegetation from that salt water. But then, in tho se days they had cattle, cows, and horses, sheep, and hogs, running wild and som e dom esticated all over the island. They seemed to keep the vegetation nipped off along with th e dam age wrought by the saltwater. He recalled sm all hills o r dunes near the village toward the so und side th at had \"blown up when the original island was first m ade from blowing sand.\" Trees grew in the sm aller hills. \"But the remarkable thing,\" he ad ded, \"is the hills, th e sand dunes alon g the ocean begun when the CC boys, that's the Civilian Conservation Co rps, m oved in in the early [1930s].\" They planted grass, built sand fences along the beach, and th e blowing sand kept building up. W hen a dune would reach a h eight above th e sand fence, they'd pu t another sand fence on top of that. Those are the h ills th at you see all along our coast to day. The sand fences are w ay down below m ost of t hem. As the grass grew on top of them, blowing sand caught on the grass and the hills keep growing higher, thank the Lord. The Corps had a cam p just southwest of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, adding to a collection of cabins and buildings later used by National Park Service and Ar my personnel. An elderly resident said that her m other recalled thick tr ees and vines from Avon to Buxton: When she was a girl growing up, that there us ed to be grape vines and vines all the w ay out here on the oceans ide, before yo u get to the ocean. Fro m here to Buxton it was a 216 thick, lot a tr ees, she sa id. She has be en th ere when different ones, the boys and girls, would get on, swing on them trees all the way down to Buxton. The creeks that cut from ocean to so und were clear and full o f fish and crabs when he was growing up in the 1 920s. But after the dike was built, th e dunes dev eloped, and the dredging and pum ping of sand for restoration e fforts after the Ash W ednesday storm of 1962, the creeks \"alm ost disapp eared\" and ar e not \"staying open anymore.\" The 1944 hurricane that hit the banks on Se ptem ber 14 devastated Avon more than any other v illage. The sand wall dike bu ilt du ring th e 1930s by the CCC prevented th e storm surge from sending over-wash from the sound into th e ocean and, instead, floo ded the village. A resident recalled a Red C ross re port that calculated \"98 per cent of the houses in Avon was washed off of the blocks and away from the la nd.\" A section of her house was pushed across the road, over the sand hills, and near the dike or \"diken.\" The Red Cross \"drug it back,\" and her family was unharm ed. \"The wind com e around to the west, we knew we was going to get it then, so we all went up to Mr. Fields'. He lived on a hill, and that house was packed with people, even on the stairways.\" Houses that fl oated to the beach were dragged back to the village with the \"bedway and roller\" system , where \"where you lay planks down on the sand, you take ro llers and put under the sh ills and you ha ve a hors e, truck or so mething pull it.\" By storm 's end, 96 out of 115 houses had washed off their foundations or were destroyed (Barnes 1995). Captain O'Neal's house did not float off its foundation: When m y father bu ilt the house they put a gr eat b ig chim ney block under the house, a big concrete slab that com es clear up to the fl oor, the house sat down on the chim ney and the chim ney held it. If you look at the side of the house down that way, the house is warped a little bit like this where it wanted to go that way. Each end tried to go, but the m iddle stayed the sam e and that's why there' s a little ben d there. Several Avon villagers moved to Buxton after that storm . Even the long-gone ancestors did not escape unscathed in the 1944 storm . \"A whole graveyard out th at way blew out, the 217 skele tons was lay ing the re with the b uttons wher e they ro tted off of the shirts. Th ey dug them all up and took them down t he road and bur ied them in another graveyard.\" Ships foundered, in cluding one that littered the b each with tires and inner tubes. A resident recalled several crewm en who drowned during the storm . They had four, five of them stretched out in a Little Kinnakeet boathouse where they all drowned. There was one of them they didn't find. They said he wandered off into the woods, and they found one of them later a fe w months after that in the woods. He wanted to go over there and die. Many houses in Avon were flooded duri ng hurricane Gloria in 1985. A wom an described her house when she returned to the villa ge after evacuating to he r nieces in Edenton. \"It com e in my house knee-deep. The carpet wa s rolled up, mud and water down between it. Everything was soaking sopping. And, all the mud and trash.\" Residents claim that Hurricane Gloria was the first storm for which FEMA and the National Guard were called in to help. Hurricane Em ily, in 1993, was also devastati ng to Avon residents. Many had their houses raised after experiencing flooding; som e houses that were flooded several other tim es throughout the 20th century were f inally rais ed after tha t storm. 7.4.15. Significant Places A Kinnakeeter described a half-m ile long area near the Old Kinnakeet Coast Guard station south of Avon that was low, flat, and frequ ently flooded with ocean over wash. This created a hard-packed s tretch th at villagers used f or horse rac es, as well a s autom obile race s with \"Model-T F ords, anything you could get. You c ould really pick up speed, probably 'bout to 25, 30 m iles an hour.\" A plain just west of the \"tr ack\" was a \"flat, expansive grassy area\" used for ball gam es. \"People from Hatteras, Buxton, A von would com e up by sailboats and play ball. 218 Later they cam e up by a utomobile.\" The area is now a m assive developm ent called Kinnakeet Shores with chain stores, condom inium s, and vac ation m ansions. \"I hate to see it go, really.\" The hom eplace is of great sign ifican ce to Avon residen ts. A villager po inted out that he lived in the very house he was born in, and continue d to sleep in the same room that his m other gave birth to him with th e aid of a m idwife. He recalled tha t his father h ad built the h ouse for $1,900, including \"redw ood doors.\" 7.4.16. Rituals and Community E vents Many of the community events in Avon were a ffiliated with th e churches. The Method ist church sponsored \"Children's Da y,\" where youth would come from \"Hatteras and Rodanthe, and all over.\" O ne long-term resident laments that while travel was more difficult before the advent of hard surface roads, p eople m ade more of an e ffort to get together. No w, she points out, people do not get to gether as often. Villag ers congregat ed at one or another chu rch for Easter and Christm as pageants or parades. An old tim er recalled when Old Christm as was celebrated in Avon for \"a few tim es, but m ostly it has been at R odanthe.\" Charles W illiam s describes an old Christm as-like drum and f ife march com prised of costum ed village rs, but apparen tly this occurr ed on regula r Christm as day (W illiam s 1975). Weddings in Avon involved recep tions wher e villagers would furnish the food, baking and other go odies. A co uple recalled that they g ot married b y a Justice o f the Peace, as it was typical for young couples to do, trave ling to county seats such as Eliz abeth City or South Mills. Until app roximately 1945, funerals involved hav ing a \"watch \" or \"sitting up with the dead,\" where community m embers would sit overnight w ith the dece ased, still in their bed or laid out in the parlor. Kinnakeeters, like othe r Bankers, began using the services of undertakers 219 regula rly after W orld W ar II, calling them in from Norfolk or Manteo. A n elderly wom an supposed a reason for sitting up with the dead was to keep rats away; \"It surely wasn't to keep the dead person from running away, was it? \" There was no funeral hom e in Avon, but there was a villager w ho specialized in m aking coffins: Down in the old Methodist church here, th ey had special lum ber provided to m ake coffins. W hen a person would die, Mr. Tilm an Gray, and the carpenters would m ove in, bring the lumber out under the oak, cut the coffin boards. I rem ember them sawing across the boards to m ake the little cuts so you could bend the boards to fit the shoulders. Then the people would cover [the coffin in terior] with som e sort of m uslin. A wom an named Marie Hooper would be called to \"d ress the dead,\" or w ash and dress the body. The body would typically be buried three days after death, as \"Chr ist died and rose on the third day.\" Christm as was anothe r signif icant tim e for reunion and f ellowship. A village r raised near the Coast G uard station at Little Kinnakeet woul d com e to Avon every Christm as and stay with an aunt. They would \"always have to have so mething ex tra for Christm as dinner, lik e wildf owl or chicken.\" She noted that \"if they'd killed a ho g, we'd have som e of that saved for Christm as. Baked m eat or stewed meat. Oh, they'd cook up a sight of pies. Potato, lem on, apple.\" They sometimes cooked oyster stew, adding Pa mlico S ound oysters and \"water, pepper and salt, and fry out salt pork. That's the old-tim ey like we used to do it.\" Clam chowder was cooked the same way \" but you put potatoes in clam s.\" Nowa days islanders m ay use m ilk in their oyster stew, but clam chowder is always cooked with a water base. Christm as meals usually included corn bread and sweet potatoes as well. Girls r eceived sm all gifts like do lls, but \"there weren't much to buy from them days.\" An older villager recalled wh en the churches beg an having C hristm as trees and villag ers would exchange gifts there rather than at hom e. But after a few years th is practice stopped, as \"a 220 lot of people weren't able to buy th is lot of stuff, and there was a lot of people that didn't get anything. A nd I think they thought it wa s embarrassing to som e of the people.\" 7.4.17. National Park S ervice Avon residents expressed m ixed feelings about the Nationa l Park Service. A wom an stated that th e trans ition to the Nation al Seashore pitted villagers against one another to a degree, where \"one was fussing because the other one h ad sold their land.\" She felt som e people had been short sighted, inclu ding her fath er who had land \"clear to the beach \" that he tu rned over to the National Park Service; they figured \"it wasn't any good, all that sand.\" One villag er could not re colle ct the meetings tha t were he ld regarding the estab lishm ent of the National Park Service, but did rem ember \"there was a lot of flab going.\" She thought it was a good thing that the Park was established, or \"we wouldn't even have nothing to look at.\" 7.4.18. Coast Guard and the Military Avon villag ers have a lo ng history w ith th e lifesaving serv ice and U.S. Coast Guard. As stations were located just to the south and to the north of the village, Kinnakeeters w ere in a prim e position to obtain governm ent jobs, and th e community was m ore oriented toward the lifesaving service than any other village. Politic s perta ining to who received what position ran deep as well, and to this day Avon has a re putation for being a Republican stronghold on the Banks. The Little Kinnakeet lifesaving station, locat ed a f ew miles north of the v illage, was estab lished in 1874 and included a few houses for crews' fam ilies, as well as a sm all school. Although th e station was not decom missioned until 1954, th e tiny community th at grew up 221 around the s tation \"existed in nam e only\" by the Great Depression; fam ilies h ad moved to Kinnakeet proper or off-isla nd locations (Stick 1958, 243). Big Kinnakeet, on the south edge of the vill age, was established in 1878. A m an whose father was a surfm an at Big Kinnakeet for 30 year s recalled two big \"governm ent horses\" stabled next to the station. \"They didn't have tractors to pull their boats with. They had horses.\" Boys would regularly go to th e station to get haircuts; \"they we re the barb ers.\" The Coast Guard stations also used cisterns, fi rst to capture rainwater and late r for storing ground water. \" We pumped it out of the ground into the cistern as a holdi ng tank, and then we pum ped it out of that to a filtering system . We had birds in those ta nks,\" said a form er Surfma n. \"You could sm ell a dead bird. We'd have to clean the tank out - you always had bird s build nests around the edge of a tank.\" Avon residents lucky enough to have a relative st ationed at either Lit tle Kinnakeet or Big Kinnakeet could visit them frequently. A wom an, whose father joined the Coast Guard in 1922 after comm ercial fishing and working on dredges with the Army Corps of Engineers, recalled living in a r ental co ttage in Little Kin nakeet one summ er. She and her brother would \"com e back to tow n in the evenings, down here in a M odel-A Ford \" to see their friends. Later in lif e she married a Coast Guardsm an, and their two sons jo ined the Coast Guard a s well, illus trating the pervasiv eness of the service in v illagers' lives. She noted th at the Coas t Guard turned out \"a lo t of officers from around here.\" A Kinnakeet fa mily traced five generations w ho served in the Coast Guard . Joining th e Coast Guard was sim ply what one did; in 1958 one third of all Avon households received retirem ent benefits, and well over half of the village was inv olved in the servic e, cou nting ac tive members (Wechter 1975). \"My friends was all in th e Coas t Guard. They wanted m e to join the 222 Coast Guard, so I went in the Coast Guard.\" Tim e spent away from family was hard, as indicated by a resident w ho, after retiring and having one m ore child, called this daughter his \"hand-raised kid.\" Some Avon m en joined the Civilian Conser vation Corps during the Depression for the dune-building project an d made, according to a resident, $21 dollars per month. A fe w of the CCC men brought to the island m arried local girl s. W hereas most of the CCC workers were from not locals, the W PA program hired locals for a dollar a day to plant bushes, dig ditches and maintain \"what roads there was.\" Officials w ould \"bring [WPA] checks down in an airplane.\" Wom en had a role in the WPA progr am as well. The W PA set up a textile center in an old store in Avon where local wom en were supplied with m aterial and sewing m achines in order to m ake clothing for villagers. A Rodanthe wom an was in charge of the project. \"Som ebody got one of those shirts they had m ade him with the pocket under the arm . They didn't know how to sew,\" said an islander. The WPA also supplied food to the island such as barrels of potatoes, canned hamburger, and tubs of butter. Kinnakeeters, like other Hatteras Islanders, witne ssed W orld W ar II ac tivity as Germ an U-boats bombed U.S. s hips close to shore. A re sident recalled hearing the attack on the cargo ship City o f Atlanta , the oil tanker Dixie Arrow and the S.S. A lexandria as a boy. \"In the summ er of '42 m e and m y friends...stepped in five or six inches of oil th at had washed ashore where we swam, that had been covered by blowing sand overnight\" (C ouch 2002, 24). He also remembered a local dance hall cal led Ervin's Place where sold iers danced - he and his friends sometimes rode the m ilitary horse s that were tie d up behind th e estab lishm ent (ibid). Village rs were required to blacken headlights and keep wi ndows curtained. \"They had an Army jeep that 223 ran through the comm unity,\" recalle d a resident. \"If they saw a spark of light through the window, they'd rap on your door and tell you to shut it off.\" Fewer resid ents se rve in the Coast G uard or m ilitary today co mpared to y ears pas t. Yet, the tradition continues: a villag er described the stress he expe rienced in 2004 knowing that his youngest daughter was serving in Iraq: It don't help the situatio n with that girl over in Iraq. I went to bed last night and the dog woke m e up. It was 12:58 when I looked at the clock, and I got up and let the dog out. It was after four o'clock before I got back to sleep. I've tried sleeping pills, went to the doctor got sleeping pills, and they don't even work. I'm nervous all the tim e. It's a burden on you. 7.4.19. Polit ical Life Kinnakeet m irrored Buxton's m ethods of voting for lifesaving station keepers as a means of securing a governm ent job. Avon has long bee n, and still is, the so le Republican holdout on the island, and the im portance of th e ferry system as a source of employment for villagers is reflected in the Outer Banks' nicknam e of th e ferry system : the Kinnakeet Navy (Personal Communication 2004). Avon villag e has a reputa tion for kn owing how to work politics in securing ferry jobs, partly through Republican lo yalty and co nnection s. A villager recounts a tale underscoring the political leanings of the community: I went to register to vote and m y grandfather took m e up there, and he was one of three Republicans in the v illage. He said g o in th ere an d regis ter a Repub lican. So, I did. To me it made no difference. But, to him, he wanted m ore Republicans down there. I'd say it was about 50/50. But Avon's Republican - the old village. The new people that's moved in, I don't know what they are. Bu t if you're a Dem ocrat don't go to Avon politicking. It won't help. 224 7.4.20. Law Enforcement Kinnakeeters had a reputation for taking care of their own disputes, and not relying on outside help. Mary Gray shared an exam ple of how a dispute pertaining to her fam ily and an errant hog was settled in the 1920s: The hog weighed 300 pounds, and my father kept it in the yard. One of the neighbors kept com plaining that that old hog w as eati ng her cow feed every night. Mam a said, \"that can't b e, because that hog stay s in that yard.\" One m orning we discovered sh e was down on the sound. Som ebody had shot her. S he was jum ping that fence at night and going in that lady's cow feed and com ing back. A resident recalled an in formal, almost vigi lante-style m ethod of social control b efore sheriff's deputies began patrolli ng the island regularly in 1956. Men would gather \"if som eone was beating his wife, and they'd beat the hell out of him.\" He explained that \"there w as no law down there. But nothing m uch happened - if we needed a sheriff they come from Manteo, which was an all day trip.\" 7.4.21. Modernity and Perceptions of Change In 1988, when developm ent was nowhere near the level it is toda y (2004), a villager remarked that \"now we're going to have to m ove to the country to get out of the city.\" She stressed that \"progres s\" has caused v illagers to b ecom e less close and m uch busier: There is just so m uch to put their m inds on t oday that people didn't have in those days. Everybody's working. They just don't have the tim e. I guess it's all the m odern appliances that we have today that takes our time. And, we don't have tim e for visiting like people used to. One would think that the modern appliances would give you m ore time for things like that but it do esn't. She lam ented that young villagers lack the ideals of past generations, and \"can't see beyond their nose.\" A Kinnakeeter spent 37 years away in the Coast Guard but with \"every opportunity I 225 came back to Avon.\" He stressed that he always loved the village. \"I wa tched people grow up. I watched them die. I watched the changes come about.\" T he changes that he witnessed include the com ing of electricity, the highway, an im prove d ferry system , better schools, and the return of Avon sons and daughters who were m ore worl dly and educated as well as an \"influx of strangers.\" He felt that in the old days people w ere \"so rt of com placent.\" He recalled very little \"grum bling\" and noted that withou t luxuries \"people just didn't have anything to grumble about except so cial affairs.\" A new breed of islander is more inclined to \"org anize\" and take \"an activ e part\" in civic or ecological m ovements with whic h old tim ers did not concern them selves. He viewed this more or less as a positive change . A negative change was the disinclination of young people to join the m ilitary service or work an \"eight to five\" job. You see a lo t of young people who are just drif ting from place to pla ce. Som e of them are doing v ery good. Som e of the people are fish ing, m aking good at fishing, because they stick to it. It's hard work. Others are influenced by their peers. Th ey seek m ore relaxation, more hilarity, m ore out-of-real ity experiences through drugs, alcohol. The overall effect is that Avon and other island villages are b ecom ing \"just like another m odern city.\" He also regretted the loss of freedom s that go hand in hand with \"progress,\" and an entitlem ent attitude of new property owners, and gave this exam ple: All m y life people have taken th eir families one particular place [on the s ound shore]. They've worked in the water, th ey've put up th eir um brellas, they take their boats in and out, but the land has been sold to people from New England or from Florida. [An Avon] family sat d own on the sandy beach and looke d out towards the sound. Pretty soon this person approached them and said, \"You people are on m y land.\" She was absolutely right in what she owned legally, but do you see the change that has com e about? ho would suspect that anybody in Avon would ever say, hey, you're trespassing on m y land? A wom an who raised five children in Avon poi nted out that \"we was all poor, but we was all satisfied. Nobody griped about nothing. Nobody had nothing; now they got everything and they want more.\" She also noted an erosion of neighborliness and inte r-dependence. \"Neighbors 226 would see a thunder cloud com e up a nd they'd com e with their whole gang of kids to spend the night with you. Now it's all gon e - you never see nobody no m ore.\" The lack of class differences was appealing to villagers, as \"everybody was in the sam e boat. There were no rich people.\" If one fa mily had m ore wea lth than the next, \"there was no showing it,\" although at least one villager in the Coast Guard who had a more dependable incom e than that of a fisherm an was known to get a horse and a cart and \"go around collecting canned food and take it to the people that needed it.\" \"Every month that check com e in, whether it rained or shined. The others around here was fisherm ans. So, [m y father] was always considered a good liver.\" A m an concurred th at \"the big livers around Avon were the Coast Guard;\" the 70 or so m en associat ed with the island's seven stat ions who were receiving about $60 dollars per m onth during the depression. Since villagers were white, there was m ore of a curiosity about other races than hostility. An elderly wom an recalled that he r father would invite the black deliverym en from Norfolk to dinner; em barras sed and unaccustom ed to such in vitations, th ey would he sitate but accept. Some of the old-tim ers long accusto med to living on next to nothing were overwhelm ed when m oney began circulating. A m an told a story abou t his grandfather who had accom panied his father for two years at sea when he worked a barge. \"He told daddy, ' I'm tired. I just want to go hom e and walk around.'\" Before return ing his father to Avon, \"Daddy took him to shopping\" in Norfolk: Bought him a new suit, shoes, top hat, tie, a nd a white shirt. He give him $340 in cash. (Grandfather) broke down crying, said \"I wish your m other Mary was here to see this.\" He never saw that m uch m oney in his whole life. W hen he com e home he took a lot of that m oney and bought little gifts for all these pretty girls. My gra ndfather thought he was a lover. 227 A villager who now lives in Nags Head but return s regularly to his hom eplace in Avon said that he grew up with \"old island people,\" but now \"the old people have died off, so with them the village kind of died.\" A villager in her nineties agreed, lam enting that her old friends have passed. Her neighb or and lifelo ng confidant recen tly died. She gestu red to across the road and said : I always looked forward to that light over ther e. I'd always see that ligh t, where she'd be in the living room . I sit here night after ni ght, and I get to thinking about her. I'm the only one that's living up this way. In recent years, drug abuse and related crim es have becom e more prevalent in Avon than other villages. This is of great concern to Kinnakeeters who have attended funeral after funeral for youth who overdosed on prescription drugs or he roin. A former sheriff's deputy reported that he experienced \"hom icides, suicides, everything [ on the island]. In A von [substance abuse] is the worst.\" He felt drug s were a particular pr oblem in this village becaus e \"the law never messed with Avon. And the law was never that a ggressive as far as drug enforcem ent;\" although he added in 2004 that \"the sheri ff's done a great job cleaning it up in the last two years.\" Avon has \"lost ten [young m en] since 1990, drug overd ose, suicide, hom icide b ecause of drugs.\" A fisherm an felt that the drug pr oblem stemm ed from youth \"losi ng their culture,\" and another resident pointed to a lack of direct ion and purpose in people's lives. You know why they pop pills ? These people don't have any thing to do. They don't wake up like I do. You seen m y stove I got out there? When I wake up in the m orning, I go in the garage and cook breakfast. I'll have bacon and eggs and sausage, baked biscuits. I sit there and think of what I'm going to do that day. Although conceding m any of the newcom ers to Avon are fine people, especially the retirees who appreciate the slow pace, som e residents worry that the culture of the village is eroding. \"P eople are go ing into Avo n and payin g a half m illion dollars f or those o ld houses and tearing them down. They're putting up places on stilts. Once the old peo ple are gone, it's ov er.\" 228 An elderly resident who lived on less than one acre of land cited rising property taxes as an unfortunate part of change. \"O ur taxes was $3 dollars and som ething. This year they're $341.\" Another Kin nakeeter who lived near m arshland recalled paying $13 dollars in prop erty tax in 1973, com pared to over $600 dollars today. Many question if their children or grandchild ren will be ab le to afford to live in Avon given the soaring costs of property. In the past , parents deeded property to their children; the property was not expensive and it was expected that children would make a living in the village. Today parents deed extrem ely valuable propert y to their children, but are not sure their descenden ts will be ab le to m ake enough wages to pay property tax. All m y property is turned over to m y kids, so wh en I die all they got to do is step in. It's not like m e - when I got m arried the first time I was m aking $125 a m onth. I had a car, rented an apartm ent, and bought food. My fi rst w ife worked for the telephone com pany for $25 a week. W e got by. It takes two toda y to run a house. Their m ortgage paym ent is $700-$1,500 a m onth. Back in them days it didn't cost that m uch. I rem ember one wife and I we used to buy chicken backs and necks to m ake soup out of it just so we could buy a pack of cigarettes. 229 7.5. Buxton 7.5.1. Name, Place, and Features Buxton, six m iles south of Avon and just north of Frisco, was listed as \"Cape Hatteras Indian Town\" on early m aps (Figure 7.5.1.). The fi rst post office, establis hed in 1873, served a community sim ply called \"The Cape.\" The name \"Buxton\" was chosen in 1882 after Judge Ralph P. Buxton (Crumbley and Ertzberger 198 8). The name \"Indian Town\" cam e from a population of Am erican Indians that resided or camped at the Ca pe. East Carolina University archaeo logist David Phelps recen tly found large n umbers of European trad e item s at a site in Buxton, from an Algonkian village thought to be the capital of the Croata n chiefdom (W ard and Davis 1999). The native population encountered at European contact was steadily reduced to poverty. In 1714 the North Carolina Council ordered that the Hatteras Indians be supplied with corn, but the group never recovered. The last reference to Indian inhabitants was in a 1788 deed transferring the \"Ind ian Town\" s ite and ore from \"Mary Elks , Inden,\" to \"Nathan Midyett\" (Stick 7.5.1. Satellite Im age of Buxton. Source: N C Division of Marine Fisheries. 230 Buxton, located 10 feet above sea level a nd tucked in the wooded elbow of Cape Hatteras, m ade the villag e a desirable place for people to live. Many m oved from Avon after various storm s and flooding. A vill ager explained that her house, built in the 1800s in Avon, was moved to Buxton by her parents-in-law when they decided to reside in the seclud ed village: They took it down in sections and put it on a boat, sm art old codgers. And they com e sailing down the sound with it and landed down he re. Then they hauled it up here and put it back up. So it's got a l ittle history to it. It's seen som e storm s. Could tell som e tales. Although its location afforded m ore protecti on for villagers, a unique feature of Buxton made it a particularly dangerous area for m ariners: the Diamond Shoals. Diam ond Shoals juts 25 m iles off Cape Hatteras in a three-tiered diamond shape, consisting of Outer Diamond, Inner Diam ond, a nd Hatteras Shoals (Payne 1985). E ach shoal is separated by a slough. Diam ond Shoals is the prim e reason surrounding waters have been called the \"Graveya rd of the Atlantic,\" not only because of the m any ships that have run aground and broken up on the shoals, but because it is the poin t of confluence where the warm Gulf Stream meets the cold Labrador curren t, the \"weather-breeder hatche ry\" for the east coast. S evere weather system s tend to form off Cape Hatteras and m ove north (Wechter 1975, 173). Thus, the area was the chosen location for the Cape Hatteras lighthouse, a focal point of Buxton; the area also houses facilities associated w ith th e ligh thouse, such as National Park Service offices and a visito r cen ter. The Hatteras W eather S tation has also been located at the Cape, as has a Navy base (Map 7.5). 231 Map 7.5. Buxton Village with Historical Sites (n ot to scale). Sketch by B. Garrity-B lake. In addition to its lush stand of woods , prehistoric Indian site s, and Cape Hatteras lighthouse, Buxton is known for ld Fessenden. Fessenden tr ansm itted th e first 232 musical notes received b y signal fro m Buxton to Roanoke Island, successfully sendin g the first wireless m essage and foreshadowing the radi o (Stick 1958, Wechter 1975) . Guide wire anchors are still vis ible at Fe ssenden's towe r site, and the community has since built a community center named in his honor near th e original location. The sand ro ads in Buxto n were known as \"car t roads\" and were not \"wid e enough to pass unless you went in the bushes.\" They wound throughout Buxton W oods, \"trees all the way down.\" Compared to the long, barren stretch fr om Avon, travelers m ust have found great relief reach ing the lush woods of Buxton. \"The pine s would hang out over the road and th e sand was so hot, you'd have to run from one shady spot to the other so you woul dn't get your feet burned. The lim bs hanging out there m ade a shady spot.\" Buxton residents, like m any other islanders, used the term \"up the road\" and \"down the road.\" The former was in th e direction toward Avon, while the later was going toward Fris co and Hatte ras. Rollinson road, a side avenue off Highway 12, was once a part of the m ain road. Buxton was unique in having freshwater ponds where islanders coul d go ice-skating in the winter and bass fishing in the warm er months. Along the sound shore the water was ideal for swimming, with shallo w, sandy shoals. The o nly muddy place was \"right off the heel of a creek.\" \"Doctor's Hole\" was a place in the water where \"the f reight boats had kicked o ut.\" A villager recalled saving a girl who had disappeared into that hole: I was polling the boat in, and three or four gi rls were going to wade in. This girl, much shorter than the rest of them , got in the hole. They began to scream for me, that Alice wasn't there. So I had to pole back out th ere to w here th ey were. And I co uld see the bubbles com ing up where she was. I reached ri ght over the side of the bo at and pulled her over the washboard of the boat. Wate r cam e out, and that's what saved her. 233 Standard Oil Com pany dug an exploratory well near the lighthouse in 1946. A channel was dredged \"to bring oil well equ ipment in he re because they couldn't b ring it down on the beach. They brought it on barges\": They had to run an oil line all the way along the edge of the road out to the lighthouse all the way out to that oil w ell and that's a long ways. They had two great big diesel engines. They worked night and day. You could hear the engines running from here on a calm night. The com pany did not f ind oil, but d id hit a \" trace of gas\" and unearth ed \"a ncient bug s\" fossiliz ed the ir core sam ples. Villagers recalled few rifts within th e community. A wom an cited the s aying, \"W here there's children and dogs, you're going to have tr ouble,\" but, she added that to her recollection neighbors got along well and people were generally \"kind and easy going.\" Her m other \"would cook up a big, old pot of stew and the neighbors would all share it li ke one big fam ily. Honest to goodness, I can't rem ember any of them ever ha ving a fuss.\" Early fam ily nam es Mille Ballan ce, W hite, Stowe, Scarborough , Whidbee, W illiam s, up in Buxton eating \"fish galo re,\" includ ing th e trad itional Outer Banks dish of stewed or boiled red drum : You boil it and boil potatoes. You fry up sa lt pork and m ake a gravy. You cut up an onion in that grease. You take your f ish and potato on your plate and flake it. Then you take this grease and put over it with black pepper and you have biscuits or fried cornbread and, honey, it's bad eating; you really got a down hom er. An elderly v illage repo rted that they always had dessert with fis h. Potato, bread, or pumpkin pudding, rice custard, pies, and cakes w ere comm on choices. A nother com mon dinner was fried, stewed, or baked chicken with rice, be ans, or greens. So m uch of their food cam e from fishing, duck hunting, and farming that villag ers did not feel the im pact of the D epression 234 that people did in m ainland or big city areas. \"We could always rely on fishing and our chickens. We got eggs and m eat and a gard en - you'd m ake enough selling som e fish to buy flour and m argarine.\" N eighbors looked after one another during tryi ng tim es. \"Nobody was going hungry,\" explained a villager, \"because p eople here do n't let anybo dy go hungry if they know about it.\" A village r describ ed gro wing up in Buxton as \" primitive\" b ecause of no highway or electricity. She said that peopl e fished, crabbed, or went to th e beach, and that the lighthouse was the \"m ain thing\" the village had to offer. Growing up in the 1930s, she expressed a feeling of isolation due to trans portation dif ficulties and a lim ited ferry schedule. Buxton had better water, accord ing to villager s, than other lo cation s because the v illage was higher and the well water was of good quality: My m other and grandmother had good water. People had cisterns and caught rainwater for cooking and drinking. You used the well poi nt water for baths, washing cloths. You would soon use up the rainwater. Rodanthe had terrible water. It was awful. People in Frisco m ostly depended on rainwater. They ha d a lot of barrels they would use to catch rainwater. Hatter as had rainwater to o until they got ele ctricity. 7.5.2. Relation to Other Villages and Beyond Many Avon fa milies m oved to Buxton after the devastating storm s of 1929, 1933, and 1944. This connection has not stopped villagers from teasing Avon reside nts about their history of making yaupon tea. \"We kid the Kinnakeeter s, we being from Buxton, and I think everybody does,\" said a Buxton m an. \"We say, Kinnakeeters, highly fed, yaupon tea and crackling bread.\" Buxton was described as m ore of an outgoing vill age than the m ore \"clan nish\" village of Avon. Another person interpreted the difference as peop le having less a sense of community in Buxton than in o ther places, bu t that people are st ill carin g to one ano ther when it counts: 235 Nobody can get together on anything. That's why we never got a boat ramp here, even though we have a harbor. Som e of the comm issioners didn't support it. But when it comes to looking out for your neighbor, we ll, nobody goes hungry here. If people think you're having a hard time m aking ends meet, you'll find them dropping off m ore groceries than you could ever eat. We do look out for one another like that. A villager d escrib ed strangers m otoring to Buxto n and runnin g aground in the shallow sound waters offshore; the strangers were helped and taken in by islanders. When you'd hear that foghorn blow and blow, you'd know that som ebody couldn't get ashore. Everything was called \"landing\" then. On the shoreline if they had any operation with a boat, it was called landing. We'd go down and take the landing skiff and pole off to bring them ashore. And we didn't know w ho they were - they were strangers. W e'd invite them up to the house a nd get acquainted with them . Bankers were known to leave the village a nd the island in search of work. A wom an moved to Virginia Beach in the 1960 s to work at a restauran t, but eventu ally m oved back to Buxton. \"[Virginia Beach] was the lim elight of m y life, like a little Hollywood. [But ], when they got liquor by the drink and the Mafia m oved i n, it was bad and that's when I cam e hom e.\" 7.5.3. School Before all village schools were consolidated in 1955, Buxton had two schools: the \"U p the Road School\" in the m iddle of the villag e toward Avon, and the \"Down the Road School\" closer to Frisco. The schools offered grades one through 11. Students co uld graduate from 12th grade elsew here, or simply \"quituate\" from the non-credited school. Many Hatteras village students cam e to the B uxton School for ninth, 10th, and 11th grade. Some of the early teachers included Sadie Robertson from Morehead Cit y, Charlie Gray, and a Mr. Wright. A Buxton wom an finished the 11th grade in the early 1920s and then attended beautician school in New Bern; she said that she always regretted not graduating from high school. Another wom an said 236 that co llege \"wasn't talk ed about th en, because there wasn't any m oney, so I didn't look forward to it. I looked forward to working and m aking som e money.\" The paved road that linked all the villages of Hatteras Island led to wh at islanders refer to as \"consolidation\" in 1955 as th e small village schools closed and children we re transported to Cape Hatteras School in Buxton. Buxton was ch osen because of its cen tral location and relatively protected and woodsy setting. The tran sition was n ot problem -free, althoug h it went smoother than som e feared. \"They had too m any pupils when they consolidated,\" recalled a residen t. \"They didn't g et enough teachers and the build ing wasn't big enough.\" Because of initial ov ercrowding so me Hattera s students carried on the comm on pr actice of leaving the is land for high school. \"Som e students went to Manteo and Norfolk to high school.\" A Hatteras m an shared a comm ent m ade by his grandm other when asked what the most important change to the island was: She said [th e most importan t change] was th e consolidation of the schools, because all the kids got to know each othe r and started getting along better village to v illage. The schools consolidated when I was in the fifth gr ade. W e were pretty clear that we were going to have trouble with these other peopl e. That there was going to be f ights, problem s with the other villagers. I thought that was interesting that m y grandm other picked th at as the m ost significant ch ange because it b rought the island to gether. The consolidation of Hatteras Is land schools m et with opposition from villagers, but v illagers such as Doc Folb viewed it as a chan ge for the better. \"There was a lo t of rivalry between the different villages, but no t as m uch as it used to be because con solidation h elped a whole lot,\" (Toth et al. 1973, 49). The K-12 school began an award-wi nning journal in the 1973 called Sea Chest , for which students interviewed old-tim ers about fishing m ethods, traditional healing practices, and other cultural and historical topics. The debut issue, fo r exam ple, featured an interv iew with \"Doc Folb\", the N avy Pharm acist's Ma te who doctore d island ers from Hattera s Villag e to Rodanthe 237 (Toth et al. 1973). The journa l, started by teach ers Mildred Jeranko and Richard Leb ovitz, demonstrate d the extent to which Hatte ras Is landers cared about their cultural heritage and historical roots, and no doubt he lped for mulate an island identity in addition to a fam ily or village iden tity. \"Arm ed with tape recorders and cam eras, we students opened m any doors otherwise destined to stay closed forever as th e older generation graciously reflected on the past to us,\" recalled for mer Sea Chest editor Danny Couch. \"I' ll never forget Dewey Basnett of Trent telling the hilarious story of how the first two cars on the is land wrecked the first tim e they got near each other.\" Cape Hatteras School has served as a m eeting place for a variety of non-school communities as well, su ch as public hearings concerning fish eries, b each m anage ment, and developm ent issues. 7.5.4. Chur ch Buxton had two churches: the Methodist and th e Assem bly of God. There was at least one revival a year. \"W e had a Bible reading every morning befo re breakf ast\" said a Methodist church m ember. Another said that the \"hom ey\" feeling has eroded over tim e with an influx of new people, but she nonetheless appreciated the \"modern teachers\" and new building. \"I think it's better.\" A man raised in the Assem bly of God c hurch on the island saw both good and bad in religious co mmunities: I'm not wha t you m ight call a relig ious pers on. Church m embers will g et mad with a preacher an d send him away. That's not very church-like behavior. I've seen too m uch stuff like that, people saying one thing and act ing another way. But I've been diagnosed with cancer, and the doctors are giving m e one month to liv e. I've had several people stop by from the church to tell m e they're going to pray for me. I tell them, well - go ahead if you want to. It can't hurt. 238 7.5.5. Stores As in other villages, people in Buxton depe nded on sm all general stores for staple item s like flour, sugar, tubs of butter, lard, coffee, canned goods, as well as hardware supplies. Early storekeepers included Burton Sm ith, Octavius Fulcher, Benjam Midgett, Gray. Midgett, Hollowell Gray, and Ike Jennette ran st ores around the World War II period. \" We went to get our molasses down at Mr. Octavius Fulcher's store. He used to get this m olasses and buy it from the W est Indi es. And it was heavy; you could cut it with a knife alm ost.\" Isaac Jennette had a store in B uxton as well. \"Momm a would go there, take the lid off that round wooden barrel, pull out a p iece of salt pork and wrap it up in a piece of newspaper.\" Salesm en or \"drumm ers\" from Elizab eth City stayed at one of two s mall hotels in Buxton, or at boarding houses such as that run by Maude W hite or Caddie Gaskins, while taking orders at community stores. 7.5.6. Pastimes and Childhood Activities Buxton children m ade do with the m aterials around them , constructi ng their own toys and imaginary worlds. A Buxton m an rem embered having fun as a boy with sand and shards of glass. \"I'd get a broken window and I'd break it to get it in the shape of a boat. And I would push that glass around in the sand, an d that's the way I am used myself when I was real sm all. I was that crazy about boats and I've been ever since!\" A villager recal led m aking m ud dolls in the early 1930s: Take and make them , put them on the top of a slab of wood and let them dry out, and then we'd make doll clothes for them. They'd last a pretty good while if we were careful with them . If som e part of it broke off, we'd stick it back on with m ud. 239 She rem embered swimming in the sound with her fa mily. She said that everyone swam in their clothes, as nobody had bathing suits. \"O ur parents would go with us, and they'd go in their clothes too. Me and m y grandmother woul d be out there in the water, and she w as big, heavy and she'd float. She had to hold onto a pole to keep down.\" Some villag ers repo rted that boys h ad more free tim e than girls, as girls w ere expected to stay close to hom e, helping with chores and rais ing the children. \"You had to help do everything when you didn't have hired help, and my people ne ver had hired help. W e did the work - we girls did like a lot of girls did in those days; help ed their m other with the younger children.\" Just getting around was fun for children. \"M y brother had a goat, and Daddy m ade him a cart and a harness, and hitched it up to that and w e'd tak e rides.\" Teenagers at the Cap e, as in other villages, enjoyed big gatherings where they would cook candy, fudge, or stews. They went out to th e beach on m oonlit n ights o r go to each o ther's houses. They also had square dances to an old Victrola, which \"was m ore fun than a barr el of m onke ys.\" They traveled to Hatteras to attend d ances at th e Pavilion and later the B eacon or Tandies, where they could buy beer at eighteen. Buxton res idents enjoy ed plays or m ovies at the s choolhouse. A villager recalled a man from Wanchese wh o showed movies in Buxton once a month. Many f amilies imposed a curfew, however, on children and teens. There was a curfew, and you were hom e at 9 o'clock nights. Th at's how we were brought up. You went to visit your classm ates in the evening, but you were hom e early. We ate supp er earlier, like at 4:30 o r 5:00, becau se there were no ligh ts except lam ps. We tried to eat before w e had to ligh t lam ps because it was m ore conven ient to get th e kitchen cleaned up. Sometimes wom en threw \"basket p arties\" to raise m oney for needs such as a church function. Villagers brought hand- woven baskets or cakes to be raffled. \"If you took a cake or basket, why, your boyfriend was supposed to buy it whether he wanted to or not.\" 240 As in other villages, \"v isiting \" was a f avorite pastime, inclu ding visits f rom relatives who moved off-island for work but returned hom e occasionally. \"People m oved away, but they always cam e back to s ee their relatives,\" said a 75 year-old resident. \"Y ears ago it w as so m uch fun to see them and have them for di nner.\" They always ate. People had bigger appetites. It was fried chicke n or stewed chicken with pastry, chicken and dum plings, and co llard greens, potato salad, and boiled ham when com pany was com ing. W e ate a lot of seaf ood and fowl; trout out of the sound, flounder, and sea m ullet. 7.5.7. Medical Ca re In the early part of the 20th century Buxton had an out break of typhoid fever. Tuberculos is was a prob lem as well. A wom an recalled her h usband receiving \"the cu re\" in the 1940s, living in State Sanatorium in W ilson, Nor th Carolina for four years. Her sm all daughter visited her f ather, \"and saw her dad on the gr ound from the windows. He was on the second floor.\" No one else in the fa mily becam e tube rcular, which she attributed to careful sanitation. Our m other taught us cleanliness, and it m akes a difference. Our blankets were washed, and bedspreads and m attresses - everythi ng was cleaned with Rinso and Clorox and aired. Ev idently, he d idn't take care of hi mself because no o ne else in his fam ily got TB. I think it was the life he lived, exposure. Buxton wom en had the choice of midwives or nearby doctors for childbirth. Midwives, unlike doctors, could not adm inister ether or ot her pain relievers, and could not exam ine a mother \"internally\" but were often considered better than phy sicians. \"We had this midwife,\" recalled a v illager. \"M rs. Rovena Quidley, and she was just precious. She just delivered loads of babies\" including one at th e lighthouse keeper's house. Other Buxton m idwives included Cynthia Rollinson and L aura W illiam s. Midwives took care of m inor illn esses as well, such as the flu or croup. 241 242The Naval Station in Buxton commissioned a ph ysician who served islanders as well as military and Coast Guard personnel. Doctors, acco rding to a villager, \"didn't stay very long. You had a doctor for a couple of years and then he was gone.\" Early doctors in Buxton included Dr. Davis, Dr. Kenfield, and Dr . Eppler. Dr. Eppler was a female physician who refused to deliver babies: She would not take a maternity case. She said, \"Now, I can 't attend you. I can't deliver your child but I'll tell Miss Quidley what to do, but I can't be there.\" No one ever knew why she wouldn't. Could have been somethi ng that happened some time back, and it just bothered her. In the 1920s, the island's beloved Maurice Bernard \"Doc\" Folb served as Chief Pharmacist's Mate for the U.S. Navy, working out of the radio stati on in Buxton for over six years. His predecessor had died in the flu ep idemic of 1919. Not only did Folb serve eight Coast Guard stations and five lighthouses; he also delivered babies (often helping midwife Rovena Quidley) and tended illnesses from Hattera s Village to Rodanthe. \"I couldn't have done it if the Coast Guard hadn't helped to pull me out of swamps, push me, get me out of bad places,\" Folb said (Toth et al. 1973, 49). Folb and a nurse \"set up nursing schools in every village and taught people to do emergency work.\" Folb, like all islanders, learned to \"make do\" with the materials at hand. \"Had one boy in Ki nnakeet who broke his le g playing baseball. I was there without any tools, but they were building a house next door and I took a shingle and wrapped it in cotton and made a splint for him, \" Folb recalled (Toth et al. 1973, 48). \"We used to have special first aid lockers in every vi llage,\" he reported (Tot h et al. 1973, 44). He witnessed tuberculosis outbreaks, typhus fever, and diphtheria. \"[Diphtheria] started in Hatteras and then went to Frisco and Buxton...I used up a million units of antitoxin\" (Toth et al. 1973, 48). Folb described a fatal case of diphtheria. The diphtheria gives of a germ ; you can pull th e heart m uscle apart if you do an autopsy. I took one look at the child and wouldn't to uch it. I sent for a Navy a mbulance and doctor. W e looked at the little girl. She couldn't lie down. Her eyes were popping out of her head. I took out the anti toxin and gave it to [the Na vy doctor]. He said, \"Honey, I am going to give you a shot,\" and when she turned she fell over dead (Toth 1973, 50) Cancer seem s all too comm on in Outer Banks villages, in cluding B uxton. Patients leave the island for grueling chem otherapy or radiation, usually in E lizabeth City. A fisherm an, now deceased, re flected on his illn ess: They gave me four m onths to live unless I treated the brain cancer. That's not very long. I went ahead with the surgery, and chem o. That was six m onths ago. They told m e yesterday it's in m y bones a nd to take care of anything I ne ed to take care of, I probably have a m onth to live. Doctor asked m e if I was afraid, and I said no. I'm not afraid to die. I've lived m y life. Just sold m y boat, since I'll have no need for that. Kind of hated to see that go, I've had her so long. 7.5.8. Early Transportation Before the advent of cars and buses, island ers traveled across land via horse and cart. A villager described \"flat carts\" that allowed one to sit on the edge with \"your feet dangled down between the shaft and the horse,\" that is, along the front edge of the cart where the horse's harness a ttached. Men ordered the wheels and axles, bu t built the ca rts. The wheels were wooden with a \"flat m etal rim \" around the outs ide. Buxton fa milies rod e in the flat carts to church or down to Frisco or Hatteras: \"The road s were so salty. But that's the transportation we had, and it was nice.\" Bankers also rode horses bareback after cat ching them on the beach. A villager recalled when she and her brother were sent after one of her father's mares. They approached \"Mary\" with brid le in hand, but the m are was in h eat and a stallion ch alleng ed the child ren: We were both going to ride her bareback. But here com e this old stallion. He'd rare up on his hind legs and scream . Honey, that was two scared kids. You talking about somebody praying. W e'd get on one side and when he'd com e at us, we'd go on the opposite s ide. We kept inching alon g until h e ran back to his brood. W e'd be a-cryin g 243 telling Dad about it. He said, \"W ell, next time I'll give you a gig and gig him like that. And, very calm ly, mother said, \"No, Ji m, there won't be a next tim e.\" In the 1920s travel to distant points i nvolved switching to different sources of transpo rtation. A villager described a fa mily trip to visit relatives in W ilmington, Delaware. First they spent the day getting to Manteo by car and boat. T hey spent the night at the Tranquil House, and took a boat to Elizabeth City. From there they boarded a train to Baltim ore, and then boarded a passenger boat to Delaware. Starting in the 1930s villagers in Buxt on took advantage of the Midgett brother's Manteo-Hatteras Bus Line, riding to Manteo where they could pick up a bus to Norfolk or Elizabeth City. \"W hen they took Greyhound out of Manteo that was a sham e,\" said a villager. \"But they had to - there wasn't enough patrons. People started buying cars when they got m ore jobs and m ore money, more tourists.\" 7.5.9. Early Communication Fisherm en in the early part of the century rigged a m akeshift phone line f rom Buxton Village thro ugh the forest, over th e dunes, to a Cape Point fish dealer. \"They'd walk over and use that telephone to ring over and tell Burton Sm ith, who had a little stor e there in Buxton, that they had a load of fish, and he would send horse a nd carts out to the people to bring the fish over for them \" (Baum et al.1976-77, 46). Once the fish (typically gray trout) were carted to the village, they were iced a nd sailed to Hatter as Village where they were loaded on larg er sailing vessels for m arkets in Elizabeth City or W ashingt on, D.C. \"They also had a flag they raised to keep [the boats] from having to com e all the wa y in...if they had no ice...in warning to them that there was no need of com ing on down because th ey couldn 't handle the fish\" (Baum et al.1976 - 77, 46). 244 7.5.10. Postal Service When Pharaoh Scarboro ugh becam e postm aster of the new mail facility in 1873, the village retained \"The Cape\" as its nam e. But nine years later the nam e Buxton was adopted. The post office was located near a cu t where a shov e skiff would go out to m eet the m ail boat. An early 20th century postm aster was Maude W hite, called affectionately the \"m ayor of Buxton.\" This was because of her fa miliarity with everyo ne through the post office and a sizeable boarding house that she ran. As the m ail boat could not navigate the shallo w sound waters to the shore, it would pause offshore at the lead while m ail and passengers got loaded into a sm all shove skiff that m et the boat. \"They used to say, \"tin cent\" please,\" recalled \"Doc\" F of the pronunciation of \"ten.\" \"Every vi llage had a little skiff and woul d pole out to m eet you, to pick up passengers and freight, then pole them to shore and pay them 'tin' cents\" (Toth et al. 1973, 48-49). 7.5.11. Early Trade Buxton old-tim ers described a m ill, and, at one tim e, a cornfi eld on the so und side of town. Corn was also bro ught in from the m ainland, and after the m ills were closed, corn m eal. A man recalled when the old m ill collapsed, and the two m illstones landed in the soun d. \"W e used to have to watch for those stones and not get the boat onto them . If t he tide was low, you could see th em out there.\" Before tourism took hold on Hatteras Island, residents struggled to m ake ends m eet, especially w hen comm ercial fish ing was depress ed. Like Frisco villagers, Buxton residents were dependant on firewood from Buxton Woods, both fo r household use and to sell to others. \"W e 245 used a wood burning sto ve, a box sto ve they calle d them ,\" recalled a m an. Boat builders in Buxton included Bill Q uidley, who built s ail ski ffs and shove skiffs, and Rocky Rollinson, who \"hewed ribs from trees and steam ed them ,\" building boats such as the Odessa and the Lucille when he was not fishing commercially. In the late 1950s early 1960s tourism existed, but there were too few hotels and restau rants to provide su bstantial employm ent. A village r describ ed how he trave led all the wa y to Oregon Inlet each day in order to m ake a living. In 1962 I went to work o n a state ferry at a dol lar an hour. We'd rid e with each other. A dollar an hour wasn't stretching too far so I had to go back on the pilot boat. Jobs w ere scarc e. You eithe r went of f in the m ilitary or in the Merch ant Marine s - some of the m en stayed and m anaged to m ake it fishing but the bulk of them had to leave hom e. 7.5.12. Commercial Fishing Buxton was more im portant as an inform al county seat rather than as a fishing village, accord ing to geographer Gary Dunbar, but fishin g was always part of village life (Du nbar 1956). Buxton had an offshore fish house in Pa mlico Sound, called the \"ice house,\" where fish were offloaded to an Elizabeth City-bound buy boat. Hayes Farrow of Buxton captained one of the buy boats. Fisherm en attem pted to organize a co-op once the highway was paved and ice was easily had. They paid dues, and planned to pur chase trucks, but \"it didn't work. Too m any of the ones who were going to help didn't help - it just fell apart.\" A sm all fish house operated out of the W hite's board ing house, run b y the Mille r and Gaskins families. Other fish hou ses included those run by Bill Quidley, Taylor Quidley, and W . living in Buxton keep their vessels in Hatteras village for easy access to the in let and ocean (Figu re 7.5.2.). 246 Figure 7.5.2. Fishing Vessel Lucy B . with Drop Net Rig. Photo by Danielle Waples. Comm ercial fishing is a danger ous enterprise, particularly off the Outer B anks where the weather can be so capricious. A fisherm an in Buxton described how he lost his thum b while working in Pa mlico Sound, illus trating the perilo us nature of his occupation: Our engine broke down. A feller cam e up in his boat and threw us a line so he could tow us in. It was blowing so bad we ha d trouble catching the line and tying up. The line som ehow got hooked over his throttle, and yanked it down so his boat jum ped forward. I had m y hand on the false staff (a towing bit at the forward of a boat for attaching a tow line to) on m y boat, with the line around it. When his boat jum ped ahead, the line snapped tight against m y hand, and m y thum b popped right off. It shot in the air about four feet and landed right between m y feet! \"My grandfather used to say 'get ready to take a strain,'\" repo rted a villager, underscoring how hard the work was on a fishing boat. In recent years, few fisherm en encouraged th eir child ren to f ollow in th eir footsteps, as they foresaw little oppo rtunity for fi nancial success in th is industry for th em. They point to their dwindling num bers and cite the grow ing num ber of restrictions as a prim ary cause. \" We used to launch our d ories wherever the fish were, and n ow it's got to be in a des ignated zone because sport fisherm en are there, touris ts are over here, sea turtles are there.\" So me were esp ecially 247 248discouraged over the Cape Point controversy that raged in the early 1990s as sport fishermen sought to restrict commercial fish ermen from a coveted fishing spot. It got especially bad at Cape Point where fish ing is the best. I reme mber getting ready to set my net, and there was a fella standing ther e in hip waders with r od and reel. He said, \"You'll probably catch a lot of fi sh with that net today.\" I said, \"I hope so!\" And then he just went on me, starting bl essing me out. It got so bad I told my boy, \"You better find a different way to make a living.\" The conflict with recreational a nglers is felt more along the seas hore near Buxton than in other areas, as the Cape has long been a pr emier location for surf fishermen. A Buxton fisherman even gave up his coveted pound net permit rather than pass it to his son. Pound net sets are allotted by the state by special permit, and some fishermen hold areas that have been in their family for generations. Some sets \"catch better\" than others, depending on proximity to a slough, inlet, and so on. The Buxton fisherman, dying of cancer, said that his son wanted his pound set, but he re fused. \"I gave it up,\" he explai ned, letting it revert back to the state: I told him he didn't need to get into this me ss. Said, you're doing fine with what you're doing now. He's got a heating and air condi tioning business, and built that house back there to rent. He's only in his fortie s, and he's making a good way for himself. 7.5.13. Hunting A lighthouse keeper's family had an intere sting way of getting shorebirds for supper. On stormy nights, beach birds would hit th e light. Daddy would call down next morning and he'd say, \"Bring me a bucket,\" and get bucke ts for the birds. They make the nicest pot pies, you know. Our mothers would cook them up. They were good, too. \"White's Hill\" was a hunting club and tour ist home run by a prominent Buxton family, the White's. They offered employment to some Buxton residents, not only as hunting guides but also as housekeepers and cooks. \"My m other would go up there and work for them, cook breakfasts, \" recalled a v illager. 7.5.14. Livestock and Gardening Bankers in Buxton typically had cows, and we re rar ely with out m ilk between their o wn supply and the habit of sharing with neighbors. \"Rany's father had a cow and if she had a calf first, why, they would give us m ilk. Then when our cow had one, we'd give them som e.\" A m an born in 1906 recalled h is wife selling m ilk for ten cents a qu art. He said th at Buxton ch ildren \"were all raised from the cows,\" and that he fed about a dozen cattle, som e \"that I hadn't raised but that came up for food. They run at large.\" Livestock feed, supplem enting the anim als' diet of natural island vegetation, wa s mail-ordered. Herds of cattle were called \"gangs\" by island ers, and residents at the Cape recognized distin ct groupings: th e wild gang was com prised of cattle \"raised in th e woods and swa mps and loaded with fat the year round,\" behaving \"as wild as any deer in the woods.\" The shore side gang was made up of cows m ore \"tam e, and when you'd drive them they were slow.\" Finally there was a gang of 20 or 30 running at large between Buxton and Avon. Buxton W oods was a favorite hideout fo r free-ranging goats, earning villagers the nicknam e \"Goaters.\" \"We'd call them Goaters and, m an, you could get in a fight in a hurry over calling them a Goater,\" laughed a Hatteras villager. The state began requiring all livestock to be dipped ever y two weeks during the summ er to reduce dis ease-carryin g fleas and ticks. This e ffort was part of the \"cattle tick war\" led by the U.S. Departm ent of Agr iculture between 1921 a nd 1926. In Buxton, a group of eight to 12 riders 249 would leave before daylight down Davis road, w hich was a p ath tha t jutted off the m ain road to the beach. We had to go before day light b ecaus e the wild g ang would sleep out a long the surf, o n the beach, to get clear of the m osquitoes a nd the f lies. They would be down at the water's edge, lying there asleep. If they didn't hear the ride rs, they'd ge t the sm ell, the same as a deer. They'd head for the woods to get in the swam ps. W e had to keep them down on the surf by the lighthouse up to where our vat was in the edge of the woods. Blocked by the riders, cattle would s ometimes head into the o cean th rough the surf an d stand waiting on a sandbar. O nce, three cows were herded off a sandbar by Charlie Rollinson, Eddie Midgett, Ruffm an ridi ng a \"nice stall-fed horse of my grandfather's.\" Two cows got away and one lay at the foot of a dune. \"W e had to draw straws to see who would go over the top of the hill. I chose the straw,\" said Gray. While his companions watched from their horses, he crep t ove r the h ill on f oot to scar e the cow: That buffalo cow saw me. She didn't do a thi ng but take after m e! I had to run around the hill to get to m y horse. She was so clos e, I could feel her br eath and couldn't get on my horse. I had to go around the hill a second tim e! The m other two ri ders were in their saddle dying laughing! Just se t right there and laughed at m e. And we lost all three. Some livestock was sold to m ainlanders who sail ed 30 m iles to the Cape and loaded their newly purchased cattle on boats. Villagers als o had hog killings for m eat, \"ch itlins\" (chitterling s), and lard. A m an named Jesse Foster was considered one of the experts in hog killing and was calle d to assist villagers: He didn't shoot them . He hit them in the h ead and they'd fall back. After they died, they'd stick them to let the blood out. You'd have a barrel with boiling water sitting on a kind of angle, and after they died, slide them down into tha t barre l and ro ll them over in that. That would loosen the hair on to them . They'd com e out just as pretty and hairless. Then they'd cut the h ams and the sho ulders and start the ribs. The wom en would make sausage, ch itlins. Gardens in Buxton yielded a bit m ore produce than other H atteras Island locations because if its wooded lushness and close prox imity to th e Gulf Stream . Beans, cabbag e, 250 251collards, Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions , tomatoes, and cucumbers were some of the vegetables grown. A resident said that the sandy soil was especially good for potatoes. \"I decided that after I dug my sweet potatoes, I would take a couple of them and weigh them. And those two sweet potatoes weighted eight pounds, 13 ounces when I put them on the scale! They wasn't good for baking - you could slice them and fry them.\" Gardeners ordered seed and sweet potato sprouts through the mail; they would arrive by mail boat via Manteo. A villager said that most sought after sweet potato was called \"Puerto Rico yams.\" \"Woods mold,\" or a mulch of dead l eaves, pine straw, and \"r ind\" or tree bark was used to fertilize gardens. Woods mold was collected amid the pi nes, oaks, and hollies of Buxton Woods. Buxton residents collected wild black grapes that grew near the present-day National Park Service cabins. A sand hill stretched from Park Service property to Creed's Hill, and back behind the grasses and bushes were holly trees hea vy with grape vines. Villagers made jams and preserves from the grapes, as well as from bl ackberries growing between Buxton and Rodanthe \"in the woods near the shore.\" Villagers also ha d fig, apple, and peach trees. \"I had a lime tree,\" said a villager. \"And, I knew a fella who had a couple of nice or ange trees. But it gets too cold in the winter.\" A particularly large grapefruit tree lost more than 100 green grapefruits during a \"crazy, freak hurricane\" of September, 1949. By far, fig trees were the most important and readily grown fruit, while citrus was \"introduced ...as proof to tourists of the mildness of the climate\" (Dunbar 1956, 133). 7.5.15. Perceptions of Environment and Storms Before the weather service began naming hu rricanes in the 1950s, people remembered storms by the year they hit. A woman from Buxt on explained that islanders did not even use the word \"hurricane.\" \"W e didn't know about tornad os and hurricanes. It was either a bad northwester or southwester or so mething like that.\" No m atter what the nam e, she loved storm s: I guess it's the savage in m e. It's unbelievable that som ething like that could just boil up so quickly. I'd tell m y husband, \"Com e on hone y, we've got to go to th e beach. He'd fuss and fum e, say, \" We're going to get in trouble som etime.\" W e'd go stand on those dunes and watch th at ocean com e boiling in and the wind blo wing like m ad. She never feared the storm s, and recalled her fath er saying, \"never be af raid unless you see m e afraid.\" \"If he was afraid,\" she added, \"he wasn't going to show it. W e just thought, well, if m y Dad can take it, I can take it.\" A Buxton man supported the dune-building project, begun in earnest after the 1933 storm , but later observed that the dun es accelera ted erosion. \"When we had a flat beach, the prevailing w ind in th e summer is hard southwest, moving sands from the south beach to the north beach. W inter it's the opposite. Nature's balancing act. Now the dunes block it.\" An old- timer rem embered when Buxton had m ore forested area. \"It's been all cut out and developed now. It's a sham e because now we get tide - cutting tre es causes the tide to com e over.\" People living on the Cape so fa mous fo r \"making weather\" are keenly aware of hurricanes and storm s. In fact, the nor'easters th at can develop \"in as li ttle as 12 hours and churn up waves large enough to over-wash...the only road to the m ainland\" pose as m uch if not m ore a threat to island reside nts (DeBlieu 1998, 5). Cape dwellers long learned to read the signs of an im pending storm . The thrust of the Cape out into the ocean is such that a passing wa ve m ay \"register...with a crack like a shot of a pistol\" and the \"sound of the surf pounding th e shore north or west of the Cape...has a significance that is bred into an Islander. For them the sea always telegraphs her punches\" (MacNeill 1958, 119). 252 7.5.16. Significant Places The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse was significant to many Buxton reside nts. An elderly villager recalled when her father was the ass istant keeper, and her family resided in a portion of the keeper's quarters. That little ro om upstairs, my sister and I had that for our be droom . We'd take the screen out of the window nights and lay there and watc h the rays. W e used to have these old, lovely rays that go from the tower, the light. Just li ght everything up. Between the lighthouse and the ocean was a ballp ark and diamond, where those from all over the island gathered for gam es. After W orld W ar II, villagers gathered at the baseball diam ond for games between a team of locals from Buxton, Hatte ras, and A von and a team of servicem en in the Navy. People had picnics there as well, and horse races. \"Mr. Guthrie Midgett had a racing mare with a cart. And John Gray had a regular po ny that used to run on the beach. They used to have trot races.\" A villager recalled vis iting the site o f a for mer lighthouse th at she called Old Tower Hill. At this hill was a \"dripping stone,\" which was likely a sm all spring: It was known as the dripping stone. I have been dism ayed that they ever destroyed that. Under this rock, it formed a li ttle tit-like thing, and that w ould drop at regular intervals down on this rock underneath of it. Clear water would com e out of that rock som ewhere. Kids told us if we got any water on our finge rs it would turn to stone. So, I stuck m y finger in there and let it get good and wet. I didn't sleep m uch that night. Every tim e I'd wake up I'd wiggle this finger! Family land is as im portant to Buxton v illagers as other island ers, and m any live in adjoining fam ily lots. A resident looked out his f ront door and explained his kin-shared compound: This was a fam ily enclave, literally, right here. My folk's house was where m y brother is living right directly in front. My cous in lives right next door to him where the grandparent's house was. The house he was born in is directly across the road from that, and an uncle's house was right next to that across the road over there. 253 The im portance is lander s attach to f amily grav esites is especially apparent in Buxton due to a recent controversy concerni ng the developm ent of a wooded lot on Flowers Ridge road that had a sm all cem etery within its borders. The new owner, from off-island, cleared the trees and made room for a la rge tra iler. In doin g so the crew unearthed som e clearly m arked graves, exposing a skull and gaining the outrage of locals (Figure 7.5.3). Figure 7.5.3. Graves on Edge of Cleared Lot, Buxton. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. 7.5.17. Rituals and Community E vents Christm as during the pre-W orld W ar II peri od seem ed to center m ore around food than gifts. Fam ilies would make a spr ead of two m eats inste ad of the typic al one, such as c hicken and beef or chicken and roast pork. They also had ve getables such as baked sweet potatoes, greens, fruit from gift baskets, and a huge array of dessert stored in the unheated upstairs. 254 Dad would get a plank and m other would put a white cloth over it and put it across two chairs upstairs in the big bedroom . That was piled up with pies for the holidays and puddings. I declare, I don't know how the food kept without refriger ation. W e didn't have any trouble with it. Presents included fruit and nuts that were placed in Christm as stockings, clothes, and perhaps a doll or toy. \"I never fe lt like we were cheated,\" said a vi llager. \"I always felt like we were blessed at Christmas and rem embered by fam ily and friends.\" Weddings were sim ple in Buxton, as m any opt ed to m arry in the parsonage or at hom e with fam ily in attendance. \"There w as just cake, lemonade, or punch\" at receptions. A resident said that m any weddings occurred at seven or eight in the evening, and few went on a honeym oon. 7.5.18. National Park S ervice Villagers at \"the Cape\" have had relatively intense contact w ith park pers onnel given the high profile of Cape Hatteras Lighthouse and a ssociated lands. Buxton villagers as well as people f rom other island communitie s were espec ially engage d during two major events in the past decade: the m oving of the lighthouse, and th e user-conflict at Cape Point fishing grounds. Many residents were adam antly opposed to moving the 208-foot Hatteras Light 2,900- feet from its original site in June of 1999; although the federal governm ent feared the light would soon tum ble into the ocean, islanders wanted it to stay put. S ome thought the m ove too risky for the aged structure, and felt it best to leave \"w ell enough alone.\" Others had oriented them selves accord ing to the lighthou se and did n ot like their important landm ark moved. \"It's not the sam e with it m oved because it changed all my location s,\" said a res ident. \"I used to navigate by that out in the sound.\" A Hatteras villager recalled how tourists oblivious to the lighthouse would test his grandfather's patience: 255 When they first paved the road we'd sit on his front porch and people would get lost. They'd be looking for the Cape Hatteras lightho use. My grandfather, I'd see him wrinkle up his face and say, \"You drove all the way down and you didn't see the Cape Hatteras lighthouse up there in Buxton? Do you know that lighthouse m arks some of the m ost dangerous shoals in the worl d?\" I'd say oh Papa please be nice to these people. And he'd say, \"T hey coulda run aground and killed theirself,\" and I'd say, Papa that's a car; that's a Stud ebaker! The relocation was also sym bolic of v illagers' own tenuous hold on their island and cultu re. \"Th ere's a say ing I've alway s heard ar ound here,\" said a Buxt on resident, referring to the resiliency of the Outer Banker. \"The light house is c racked all th e way down but it's still standing.\" People are fatalists here - that's why they we re at terrible odds with the Park Service, that's why they did not want that lighthouse m oved. It's an act of God, if God wants that lighthouse to m ove, you know, God'll m ove it. It was even deeper than that, now I'm speaking for them , okay? I'm dredging their heart for you. And, nobody knows if I'm right or wrong. It was like, if you move th e lighthouse, are you going to m ake us m ove next? It was a real deep nerve. In the early 1990s recreational surf fisherm en increasingly complained about comm ercial dory crews that would show up in the winter and ne t large schools of bluefi sh. Both the National Park Service and the state Division of Marine Fis heries work ed to arb itrate the conflict. Form er park superintendent, Tom Hartm an, characterized the prob lem as one of culture and sym bolism : seine netters represente d a \"visual irritation\" to anglers (W est and Garrity-Blake 2003, 65). After a series of heated m eetings, the dorym en agr eed not to f ish within a half-m ile radius of the tip of the point (Figure 7.5.4). Many were left with a bitter sense of betrayal, however, as expressed by this fisherm an: The Park Service h as gone agains t their ow n agreem ent. The y got it written down on paper, that they would run the park but not interfere with the local p eople's ability to make a living. Then they com e back and say, \"Rules are m ade to be changed.\" W ell, I don't like that. 256 He went on to propose that the Park Service wa s biased toward the se ctor that frequented National Seashore beaches, cam pgrounds, historic site s, and interpretive disp lays: visitors. \"The Park Service caters to the touris ts - th ey bring them in, give th em speeches on the environm ent, the history - so they're always going to go along with the tourists .\" He considered commercial fishing and other present-day ac tivities stemm ing from the traditions of B anker life to be important cu ltural resources tha t the National Park Service should prom ote and explain to visitors. Like m any islanders, this fisherm an agr eed that the establishm ent of the Park prevented wall-to-wall developm ent a la Nags Head, but ad ded, \"W e've also lost a lot of freedom.\" Figure 7.5.4. Sportsm en's Off-Road Vehicles Lined up at Cape P oint. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. 7.5.19. Coast Guard and the Military Until th e Coast Guard to ok over the lighthouses in 1939, three ligh thouse keepers tend ed the Cape Ha tteras Ligh t. They lit the lam p half hour bef ore su nset, and m ade sure it s tayed lit 257 throughout the night. Th e 1933 storm destroyed a stee l-piling jetty that was built in front of the lighthouse o nly three years before. The daughter of one of the keepers recalled when the th ree men were enlisted to pa int the sp irals after the h ired painter left the job unfinished, and her father led the ef fort: I don't recall whether it was the white paint they spilled on the black or vice versa. So my Dad volunteered to paint it. I can see him now. They fixed this box and they got on it from the top of the to wer. They lowered him down. They kept lower ing him till they got all that painted out. He had a cheering mob on the ground. W e were all ou t there. He was a whistling and carrying on him self. On an especially storm y night when her father w as having trouble keeping the light on; her m other realized he had forgotten his lant ern and sent the daughter to deliver it: She bundled m e up and gave m e the lantern a nd extra m atches, and I had to alm ost bend double to w alk against the wind. But I got up th ere and he was so glad. O n the way, we both heard a cat m eow, a nd we searched that to wer over and never did fi nd that c at. My Daddy was not a superstitious p erson and he said he couldn't accoun t for it unless it was just on the ledge and blew off after it meowed. We never did find him . Lighthouse keepers were \"as m uch farm ers as keeper s of the light - they had vegetable gardens, chickens, hogs, m ilk cows,\" said the granddaughter of a keeper. They fertilized their gardens with scrap fish like fatback (m enhaden) and flou nder. \"W e did flounder.\" They would also \"grub up\" with store-bought provisions once a month. She recalled three fam ilies of keepers that lived near the station; th ey had a \"summ er kitchen\" separa te from the house and used a New Perfection kerosene stove. W hen the Cape Hatte ras light was rebuilt, m aterials were carried by barge to Cape Creek or B ack Landing Creek on the north soundside of Buxton. Thirteen m iles off the tip of Cape Hatteras was the Diam ond Shoals lig htship. In 1918, at the height of W orld W ar I, a Germ an subm arine torpedoed ac tivity the lig htship. W alter Barn ett was Captain at the tim e. The lightship was stil l in comm ission in the m id 1950s (Stick 1952). 258 The Cape Hatteras Lifesaving Station was established in 1883, and becam e the U.S. Coast Guard Cape Hatteras Station #183 in 1915. The 1921 foundering of the \"ghost ship,\" the Carroll A. Deering , was one of the most highly profiled wr ecks experienced by this station. The crew spotted the five-m asted schooner, sails se t, on the outer Diam ond shoal; station keeper Baxter Miller was only able to get his crew w ithin five hundred yards of the ship due to rough seas and weather. A 20 5-foot Coast Guard cutter was able to reach the Deering four days later, and the crew found the vessel abandoned save for three cats and a fully pr epared m eal of pea soup, spareribs, and coffee (Sim pson 2002). The whereabouts of the Deering's crew rem ained a mystery: did they board their lifeboat and drow n? Were they victim s of piracy? Christopher Colum bus Gray of Buxton claim ed to ha ve found a bottle with a note from the Deering that indicated piracy. The note was later determ ined to be a fraud; Gray, a fisherm an, confessed to writing it in order to m ake sta tion #183 look bad. He had hoped someone would be fired and a Coast Guard job would open up for him (Simpson 2002). A villager working at the station in th e 1930s after it h ad beco me the Cape Hatteras Coast Guard station (#183) described a grueling training program . \"We had to turn the boats over out to sea, ride them back, a nd then do it again. D one that 21 tim es in one day: 11 at sea, and 10 on the inside, w hich was Pam lico Sound.\" He partic ipated in the last re scue before the C ape Hatteras station was washed away, rescuing eight men from a three-m asted sail v essel seven miles down the beach. They pulled a service cart, form erly rigged for horses, with a truck. \"W e just put the shafts up on the back of the truck and pulled it down the beach at low tide,\" he explained. \"When we turned it abreast of the wr eck, those two shafts come out of the truck right into the sand - over cam e everything, equipm ent and all, right on the beach. But the sea had 259 slowed down and they weren't in danger.\" A lthough they had a m ishap in using equipm ent rigged for horses, the truck proved helpful in the end: We got five of them ashore in the breaches buoy . The line g ot so slack from pulling them in, we were afraid that som ething was goi ng to happen. W e decided to try som ething else. W e used the pickup truck. Backed it down, and took a tire ou t with a tr ailer hitch onto it. And we let that truck do the pulli ng. Take the strain out, because we were holding on the lines. When we got them through the highest breakers, we began pulling them through the breakers. W e got them all to shore safe. \"Doc\" Folb of Buxton explained to Cape Hatteras studen ts how the Coast Guard beach patrol worked. The stations were about six to eight m iles apart, and a su rfman woul d \"leave at sundown till m idnight\" heading for the neighboring station. He a nd another surfm an would m eet half way and exchange tokens to prove that they com pleted the full patrol (Toth et al. 1973, 46). After the devastating 1933 storm , the Civilian Conservation Corps set up cam p just south of the lighthouse in Buxton to establish a dune li ne and build up the beach. They cut brush from downed trees and piled it on the beach along their sand fences to trap sand. A retired Ar my officer nam ed Byrum was in charg e, and accord ing to islanders the co rpsmen wore Arm y uniforms and drove m ilitary veh icles in car rying out duties of sand f ence-building and grass- planting. World W ar II brought \"d read and fear\" to the area accord ing to a Buxton native, as \"they could so easily have bombed us - the subs were out here in the ocean. They could knock the light out or the radio station so we couldn't get messages out.\" The Coast Guard towed Ar my Cavalry horses to Hatteras Island on barges for patrol duty. \" That was the last tim e the Arm y Cavalry horses were ever used for anything.\" The war also brought excitem ent, especially for young boys, as until then \"there was nothing happeni ng - it was like a tropica l island. W e were swimming every day and didn't wear no clothes.\" When a sm all Navy base was built in Buxton, incom ing recru its replen ished the 260 dwindling supply of eligible ba chelors who were leaving the is land in the late 1950s early 1960s in pursuit of jobs. \"The young girls m arried Coast Guard or Navy boys and then they left the island. There was nothing here for them .\" The Cape Hatteras W eather Station was re-lo cated back to B uxton from Hatteras village in 1956. Although it was eventually moved back to Hatteras, the Cape was a logical location given the active weather system s that were spawned off Dia mond Shoals. \"The clim ate of Cape Hatteras is fine,\" said a station m eteorologist. \"But, the weather is som ething to give a m an ulcers\" (W echter 1975, 174). 7.5.20. Polit ical Life mocratic leader from on fam ously wrote a congressm an in 1898 complaining that \"the backbone of the Re publican Party here are yaupon-choppers, mullet gillers, beach com bers - and it is no wonder they are political floa ters - a large percent of them are up 'for v alue receiv ed'\" (Dunbar 1956, 102). Buxton has long served as the inform al county seat for Hatteras Island. Although the official county seat is in Mant eo, it w as a half to f ull day's jour ney away before the Oregon Inlet Bridge was built in 1963 . Buxton houses satellite county offices and serv es as the edu cational cente r of the island ; thus the village wields a certain political clout. However, som e villagers report less of a sense of community in Buxton th an, say, Hatteras, and believe their political influence w ould be stronger with m ore consensu s. \"Nobody can get togeth er on anything,\" said a fisherm an. \"That's why we never got a boat ra mp here, even though we have a harbor.\" The importance of Lifesaving Station jobs also com pelled som e politica l maneuvering in the ear ly 261 history of Buxton: m en voted for particular station keepers as a means of securing or keeping their positions (W echter 1975). 7.5.21. Modernity and Perceptions of Change An elderly Buxton resident was asked how life on Hatteras Island has changed. \"You'd have to put on another reel for m e to tell you,\" she replied. \"There's been that m uch change here.\" She added, \"I som etimes wonder if it's for the best. I think we're getting too m any for the size of the island. But if they want to com e live here, well, that's ce rtainly their privilege.\" A villager felt th at \"youn g people do n't respect th e older p eople,\" as they did in th e past. \"We were brought up to be m ore thankful, and sharing and caring,\" she said. \"Everybody knew everybody, and you liked everybody.\" A wom an who spent m any years cooking in rest aurants does not freque nt them herself in recen t years, as eating ou t has becom e cost proh ibitive. \"Eve rything is ex pensive,\" sh e decla red, including property taxes and flood insurance. It's getting to be where hardly anybody can afford to live here now. They've gone up extrem ely high on rent and even trailers. It's just astronom ical fees people are charging. I think it's a sham e, because the youn g people, I d on't know th ey m anage. I think they've h ad to go back to two and th ree fa milies living togeth er. You don't m ake that kind of m oney here, when rent is $600, $700, $800 and $900 a m onth. On the other hand, she pointed out a much-i mproved outlook for young people regarding job opportunities: There's 100% advantages for [young people] today. They're m uch better off, and they have m ore opportunities. It's just astronom ical the scholar ships that are presented, and I'm so glad for them because there w asn't any m oney when I grew up. There were only a few that got to go to co llege. I'v e talked with other people that I've m et, and they say that was the sam e way with th eir towns. 262 Tourism has increased dram atically, and accord ing to a Buxto n residen t, the quality of touris t has c hanged as well, f or the better. \"Nice f amilies co me surfing today, but in the beginning it was beach b ums, hippies . They just wrecked ho uses and sto le. They would sleep on the beach and go sneak under the houses that were ren ted.\" Although Bankers worry that every inch of la nd within the villages is getting sold and developed, s ome residen ts have prof ited f rom the real esta te boom. A villager who ha d inher ited several acres from his father and was selling it lot by lot com pared the price difference in 1992 to 2002. In 1992 he was selling an acre for $30 to $40 thousand dollars. In 2 002 an acre in the same area was fetching $100 to $150 thousand dollars. All in all, islanders app reciate the con veniences of m odern life, but m iss the slow pace and inf ormality that m arked their liv es bef ore the highway, br idge, and in coming hoards of people. A Buxton m an reflected on the very di fferent sen se of tim e and space is lande rs had: My ancestors...had three m ajor tim es they centered their lives around - the rising sun, the sun directly overhead, a nd the setting sun. Really, there w asn't m uch need for a clock. Our watches were not on our wrists. The sun and the sea governed our lives...the men worked the sea and the sound from sunr ise to sundown. The wom en kept the hom e fires burning m orning, noon, and night (Parr 2002, 50). He described an inform al sense of measurem ent as well, and the tend ency to m ake deals with handshakes rather than written contracts. Many a land battle betwe en families on these isla nds has been the resu lt of prom ises made by anc estors that were not recorded. A lot of land deals were done by a m ere handshake...W hen the old islanders did m easur e anything, it was in yards and they used a \"pacer.\" A \"pacer\" w as som eone in the co mmunity know for his ab ility to step a yard...My u ncle was a p acer...he wo uld raise his arm s up...a nd step forward, swingin g his arm s dram atically, pacing and counting out loud. He was a \"pacer\" who m arried a \"finder\" from...Ocracoke...she had the gift of being able to use her toes to find the biggest and best clam s\" Parr 2002, 51). 263 7.6. Frisco 7.6.1. Name, Place, and Features Frisco village, on the western side of the Cape elbow of Hatteras Island (Figure 7.6.1.), was a sm all but thriving satellite of Buxton until the Hatte ras Inlet was r eopened in th e mid- 1800s and Hatteras Village becam e the econom ic center of the island. Commerce and people were siphoned from Kinnakeet and the Cape to the southernmost village at the inlet. Frisco's population declined throughout the first half of the 20th century. According to cultural geographer Gary Dunbar, the village's population was 205 in 1910, 149 in 1930, and 126 in 1940 (Dunbar 1956). E arly fam ily nam es of Frisco include Austin, Barnett, Fulcher, illiam, and hidbee. Figure 7.6.1. Satellite Im age of Frisco. Source: N C Division of Marine Fisheries. 264 Frisco was o riginally called \"Trent\" o r \"Trent W oods,\" and was \"never a nucleated settlem ent, so close to Buxton\" (Dun bar 1956, 17 3). The village, acco rding to Dunbar, lik ely experienced a population decline because of poor fi shing; he predicted, however, that Frisco's population would rise with tourism, a predictio n that cam e to pass when the Bonner Bridge ushered in tourists and land prospectors. The village's population was 300 by 1985 (Payne 1985) and 845 in 2000 (Outer Banks Cha mber of Co mmerce). Dunbar also rightly predicted that the boundaries between Frisco and B uxton would becom e imperceptible. Like other Banks' villages, Frisco in the early party of the 21st century is a m ix of old and new, with old graves juxtapos ing modern homes, orde rly subdivisio ns not far from traditional homes on m eandering roads, and w ooden work boats next to sleek fibe rglass sports fishing vessels (Figures 7.6.2-3). Figure 7.6.2. Fulcher Fa mily Graveyard in Frisco Subdivision. by 7.6.3. Frisco Photo by Garrity-Blake. Frisco was the site of Creeds Hill Lifesaving Station 20 years before the first post office was established in 1898 (Map 7.6). The village may have avoided obsolescence due to activities associa ted w ith th e station and attend ing families. \"The m en [of the Lif e Saving cr ews] built little hou ses up there for their fam ilies and they ju st started grow ing,\" reflected an islander. \"Villag es got started by these station s.\" Tren t, however, was estab lished long before the Lifesaving S tation. A prom inent feature of Frisco was th e thick, forested area continuing from the southern boarder of the community into Buxton woods. Their woodsy village is likely why residents received the old nicknam e \"Frisco T icks.\" The moist, wooded territory was a breeding ground for m osquitoes; villagers m ade smudge pots out of kerosene-soaked rags and kept them smoking on the porch. They splashed kerosene on screens, and applied it to the be dsprings. A resident recalled that the houses in Trent were sm all, although they were likely no sm aller than other 266 houses throughout the O uter Banks before W orld War II. \"They had a living room and a kitchen, two bedroom s, no bathroom s. All had outs ide toilets.\" They got electricity in 1948. \"I was glad to see it - but didn't see not hing special, \" rem arked a villager. 267 Map 7.6. Frisco Village with Historical Sites (not to scale). Sketch by B. Garrity-Blake. 268 Like all pre-World W ar II hom esteads on the Ba nks, Trenters had several out-buildings including smoke houses for ham and fish. To smoke fish, villagers scaled them and layered them in a keg with course sa lt. They f illed the keg wi th water and weighed the fish down with a br ick. They covered the barrel and brine m ixture with cheesecloth and left it alone for about a week. Then they removed the fish and washed them in fresh water; the fish we re attached through the tail to an opened wire coat hanger and hung inside the sm oke house. A large iron kettle was filled with kindling and green pe rsimmon or green oak wood; it was lit and allowed to sm older in the sm oke house for two or three days. The sm udge was rem oved from the scales, and the fish would keep for long lengths of tim e. To prepare for cooking, the fish was soaked in fresh water overnight and then fried (Jones 1973). A resident recalled a typ ical summ er day growin g up in Tren t: Our parents called us to get up in the m orning and breakfast would be on the table, always something hot...biscuits. My youngest brother and I always went fishing with our m other and father in the evening. But best of all, Papa w ould go out and fish his nets early in the morning and we ha d fish for breakfast (Nunn 2002, 20). \"Whatever o ur paren ts did, we were right th ere helping,\" sh e recalled, including weeding the garden, boiling clothes on \"was h day,\" ironing them the follo wing day, scrubbing floors, and night fishing. \" We scrubbed floors about tw ice a week and they we re beautiful...used wood ashes to m ake lye, to scrub in the chairs a nd benches and floors...looked like new lumber all the time\" (Nunn 2002, 20). Night fishing -also called \"di ngbatting\" or \"hauling\"- was also a typical family activ ity. A famous la ndmark of Frisco is a seri es of large sand dunes known as Stowe's Hills. Creed 's Hill, the largest, was the site of a lifesaving s tation. The hilly area pro tected Union troops who erected tem porary encam pments during the Civil W ar, and in the 1880s porpoise camps could be found along the beach as th ere was a sm all ren dering facto ry in Tren t. 269 A small harbor, dug in the 1960s, is the present s ite of Scotch Bonnet Marina. The harbor was especially important wh en Hattera s villagers were shuttled on and off their newly-created island after Hurr icane Isab el cut a channe l south of Frisco. Until th e new inle t was f illed in late Nove mber, Hatteras village students were transp orted by boat to the Frisco harbor and then bussed to school in Buxton. 7.6.2. Relation to Other Villages and Beyond Despite its close proxim ity to Buxton, Frisco was long thought of as its own village. It lost population from the m id-1800s to the m id-1900s to Hatteras, and a villager recalled when Frisco alm ost died out for lack of work. \"In Frisco there were som e stores up there and people did a little b it of gill net fishi ng, settin g nets out n ights and going fishing in the m ornings. Frisco almost faded out becaus e the peop le kept leaving . They went off on work.\" Frisco, h owever, did not go th e way of Portsm outh Island, Sca bbertown, settlem ents. \"There is...a lot of rivalry am ong the Seven Villages of Hatteras Island,\" wrote Ben MacNeill, excluding Ocracoke. \"They com bine and m ake common cause only when they are pitted in so me matter a gainst the s ingle village on the next island - and in turn they all combine...when there is som e confl ict, usually against the upper end of the county\" (MacNeill 1958, 94). Yet, Frisco's survival was due, in no small part, to its interdependent relationship with Buxton and Hatteras. Villag e rivalry subsided substan tially once the schools were consolidated in the 1950s, and Frisco has experienced a populati on increase partly because of families seeking to live near th e Buxton-based school. Frisco, like Buxton, is v iewed as a safer pl ace to live with respect to sto rms and flooding. 270 When asked how the community of Frisco was different from other Hatteras comm unities, a resident replied, \"Frisco is higher ground. That's probably about the only difference.\" According to Payne (1985), Frisco is actua lly lo wer than Ha tteras and B uxton villages: it sits at five feet above sea level com pared to 10 f eet for both Hatteras and Buxton. Frisco does, however, ha ve an im pressive bank of hills, and its thick g roves of trees of fer protection from storm s. When Frisco was known as Trent, it seem ed to have a m ysterious reputation in the m inds of many Hat teras Islanders. Perh aps because of the thick wo ods, Trent almost had a fairy-tale quality. Trent W oods was the hom e of Rodanthe 's mythological Old Buck, the bull that is comme morated every year during Old Christm as. Also, local legend describes a witch nam ed Polly Poiner who lived in the woods and cast sp ells on cattle and horses. A local stockm an blam ed her for his sick livestock; he storm ed into her \"hut\" while she was spinning and \"broke her neck\" (Wechter 1975, 180). The stockm an was tried and hanged; local s claim it represented the \"only legal hanging ever executed in Hyde C ounty\" (ibid). The ball ad below describes the event (\"Mattam uskeet\" refers to Lake Mattam uskeet, near the m ainland county seat of Swan Quarter). Oh, the yaupon scrub and scraggly oak, quivered on the dunes when Polly spoke. A madman turned a trick quite neat, but the noose hung high in Mattam uskeet (Wechter 1975, 180). Connie Farrow recalled the sensory experien ce of growing up in Frisco in the 1920s. You could listen to the o cean's roar and tell pretty well wh at direction the wind would be the next day. You could tell by the sunset whether it would be rainy or clear. You could walk down the road in th e ear ly morning a nd hear people grinding their coffee beans. You could sm ell such a sweet arom a from the fresh boiling coffee. Anot her sound we miss is the chopping of wood. Everyone burned wood in those days and even the sm oke from a wood fire sm elled good. W e also miss the honking of the geese and the cranking of the brant (Farrow 1976-77, 52). 271 A Frisco wom an recalled when everyone knew everyone else, not only in the village of Frisco but on the entire island. She said that if a stranger appeared, it would \"scare you to death,\" a stark contrast to today's non-stop fl ow of tourists. 7.6.3. School In the m id-1800s a sm all school operated in \"T rent,\" and a schoolm aster rescued from a shipwreck in 1837 left an im pression on the co mmunity. Joshua Daily had been bound for a teach ing job in Virgin ia when the brigantine Ralph broke up off Hatteras. He was enlisted to teach in Trent, which had becom e \"the econom ic center of the Seven [Hatteras Is land] Villages\" (less Ocraco ke) at the tim e (MacNeill 1958, 111 ). Yet, there was a paucity of school supplies, and Daily was com pelled to teach without book s and m ake use of geese quills and a m ixture of pokeberry ju ice and indigo for writin g. In 1845 the wreck of the Ontario brought a big supply of English r ag paper f or the Trent schoo l. Daily and student Joh n Rollinson, who would eventua lly serve as Collecto r of the Port at Hatteras and fi sh for the porpoise factory, wrote an arithm etic textbook out of the salvaged paper. They stitch ed the pages together with linen thread, and covered the book with sailcloth. One year late r John Rollins on began teaching schoo l him self at age 19, as \"the ascending fortunes of [Hatteras] v illage m ade it desirable that they have a school of their own\" (MacNeill 1958, 112). By the early 20th centu ry the cen ter of gravity had shifted to H atteras and F risco was no longer a hub . The Frisco School clos ed around 1 920. A villager born in Frisco in 19 15 reported attending school in Buxton in the 1920s, and then transferred to Hatteras in order to graduate. She said in her day, \"they didn't have [school] in Frisco yet,\" im plying that a school opened once again. But, by the 1940s, Frisco children were attending school in Buxton. 272 7.6.4. Church The Little Grove United Methodist C hurch long served Frisco, as has the Frisco Assem bly of God. For every Methodist church on Hatteras and Ocracoke, there is a Pentecostal as well. Ca pe Hatte ras Baptis t Church, a relatively new chur ch, also operates in Frisco. Little Grove Methodist Church was founded in the early 20th century but destroyed in the 1933 storm . The congregation m et in hom es until Fr isco villager George Austin donated land for a new church building. The new church was dedi cated in 1940. Little Grove \"fed half the people of Buxton\" during the depr ession, and m embers also attended Pentecostal tent revivals at Little Kinnakeet. \"Our church was the center of our liv es,\" recalled a villager. \"Som etimes we would go to Hatteras or up to the Cape - Buxton - for revivals\" (Nunn 2002, 21). Maggie Whedbee Austin, whose husband George donated the land for the new church, was very active in Little Grove. She served as Sunday school teacher, pianist, bell-ringer and fi re-lighter (ibid, 22). George Austin, not an \"outwardly religious m an,\" and did not attend serv ices; he r eferred to Little Grove as \"Maggie's chur ch\" (Duncan and DiSabatino, n.d.). 7.6.5. Stores There were f ew stores in Frisco. The s on of a freight boat captain rem embered one owned by Eddie W illiam s, and explained th e cost of transpo rting goods to him : I got a [ledger] book upstairs. This f ellow from Frisco, nam ed Eddie W illiam s, used to have a store. My father brought a case of tomatoes down. The whole case of tom atoes cost $1.33. He charged ten-cent freight from Elizabeth City and de livered it to Frisco, well, they ca lled it \"Tr ent\" in them days. A.J. Fulcher owned a store located in the center of the community, which was one of the largest stores on the island at th e tim e. A.J. Fulcher's was a popular place for villagers to g ather and tell 273 stories in the evening. \"Everyone paid his gro cery bill at th e end of the w eek,\" recalled a villager who grew up in Frisco in the 1920s. The m ain thing our fathers used to do was to ga ther at Mr. A.J. Fulcher's store at night. It was in teresting to liste n to the s tories th ey could tell. Around nine o'clock, they would leave and go hom e. Mr. Fulcher's store was located about the center of Frisco, so som e of the m en had quite a long way to walk. Fr om far away you could hear som e of the m strike up and sing (Farrow 1976-77, 54). 7.6.6. Pastimes and Childhood Activities Children played in the sound, swimming, crabbi ng, and clam ming. \"The boys with their carts...went to play m ostly down at the landing wh ere they caught crabs and cleaned and roasted them on the shore,\" recalled Maggie Whedb ee (Nunn 2002, 21). \"W e had a little boat that our granddaddy m ade us that we'd get to shove aroun d,\" a villager rem embered. Another described family cam pouts at the b each in the late 1950s, early 1960s: We'd go to the beach Friday night an d stay until Sunday evening. W e go and build a big bonfire, find us a gully. All of our kids woul d find them a hill they wanted to sleep on with their sleeping bag. We would put a lant ern up, hang it on a post and have a bonfire. We'd cook and roast m arshm allows and just s it there all nigh t. Next m orning we'd put our trash in bags and bury where we had the fi re. Then we'd go out on th e beach and fish all day long. A Frisco villager pointed out that in th e past, old residents spent m ore time with youngsters: Old people took the tim e to play with you. They would always play hide and seek or whatever. T hey would give us an o ld com b and a piece of cigarette paper-they used to roll their cigarettes with that real thin paper-and, they that 's how they taught us how to make music. You could play anything you wa nted on it, [as with a kazoo]. That was our music band-our washboard and tub. Adults often helped children m ake cookies or candy, not with recipes but with im provisation. \"A little b it of this and a little bit of that. Then y ou'd tas te it until you go t it jus t right. \" They introduced gam es to children like rummy, rook, and dom inoes. Adults also taught children good 274 manners, such as not to \"sit with your legs ga pped open.\" On Sunday afternoons after church child ren played baseball, an event th at garn ered a lot of interest from adults. \"Everyone...was interested in what the young peopl e were doing,\" wrote Maggie Aus tin in her diary. \"The last big gam e I played was in 1918 in front of our house...There must have been 50 parents standing against our fence watching\" (Nunn 2002, 20). Some of the older peop le enjoyed s itting on the p orch and dip ping snuf f. A village r's grandm other used to \"go out there an d take a yaupon bush and pull a little piece off of it. And then she'd chew the end and m ake a brush out of it. That's w hat she dipped down in that stuff to stick down in her jaws. She called it salt snuff.\" Frisco f amilies a ttended dances a t folk's hom es, doing the Vir ginia Ree l or Black Bottom to W alter Barnett's accordion or organ. They had easy access to the nightspots in Hatteras village that becam e prevalent in the 1930s and 1940s . Tandy's was a po pular n ightspot in Frisco where young people from Hatteras, Frisco, B uxton, and Avon would congregate for jukebox dancing. As in other villages, young people participated in \"baske t parties\" and sim ple house-to- house get-togethers. We got together for chicken stews and to cook collards in each others hom es, with parents talking in other room s, and the boys and girls cooking and dancing in the kitchen...boys didn't keep dates without thei r coats and ties on. Th e girls dressed up, too. W e had a phonograph with a horn stuck ou t front and the record s were round like a tin can...som eone played the m outh harp or accordion (Nunn 2002, 20). 7.6.7. Medical Care A Frisco res ident recoun ted a s tory o f her br other being born in a boat th at illus trates the challenges faced by exp ectan t mothers on a barrier island. All her siblings were bo rn at hom e with a m idwife \"except my brother, David. Momma left and they were going to carry her to Elizabeth City on that boat. She said she got on the boat and in about an hour she was back. Her 275 and Aunt Laurie com ing up the path holding a ba by in her arm s. She done had the baby.\" \"Aunt Rovine\" Quidley of Buxton served as midwife to Frisco fam ilies for m any decades. Sally Ann Austin \"was a m idwife who nurse d the whole community of Frisco but she was often abusive to her own children,\" wrot e her descendants in an unpublished genealogy (Duncan and DiSabatino, n.d.). The story of \"Aunt Sally Ann\" (b.1876, d. 1954) is extraordinary: the m idwife t ook up with a local m an and banish ed her husband, Marchant, \"to the loft to sleep.\" Marchant, \"lackadaisical abo ut employment,\" put up little resistance, as his wife's lover often provided food to the fa mily. Sally Ann eventually ran off with the lover to New Bern, leaving her husband to grow old and senile with one of their sons (ibid). Villagers als o took advantage of services o ffered by m idwives and docto rs in Buxton . Village rs we re relatively self -sufficient for every day ailm ents. It was up to our m om to patch it up. I was te lling the preacher the other day it's a wonder we're not all dead. W e had a cough or we got sick, they'd take a spoonful of sugar and put kerosene in it. W e always got a bottle of castor oil. She would hold our nose and say swallow this , then give u s a drink of coffee or orange juic e. I can still tas te that stuf f now, it's terrible. Hom e remedies used by villagers included m ustard plaster and red bals am in liquid f orm for bronchitis. They also used cam phor gum linim ent, asafetida, paregoric, laudanum , Sally Ann Austin's d aughter-i n-law, recalled when the whole village o f Trent was af flicted with the flu epidem ic of 1918 -1919. Everyone had gathered to play or watch a baseball gam e on Sunday afternoon. One of th e players took sick, and the gam e broke up. The next day m any were ill. Monday m orning everybody was sick in bed at our house. L ater that day we heard that all the fam ilies were sick except a n eighbor, Mr . George Farrow. He went from house to house taking care of us. He m ade bean soup and took it around to people f or about a week. I guess it m ust have been a month before people began to get ou t. This had been 276 mass influenza. Many died all over the countr y. Som e died here, in cluding m y sister and her two-year-old daughter (Nunn 2002, 20). 7.6.8. Early Communication People of Frisco first recall newspapers when the Midgett brothers began their bus service and started transporting th em in. For em ergencies they could use the telephone at Creeds Hill Coast G uard station. In the late 1930s fa milies began wiring their ho mes for electricity, and could upgrade from battery to electric radios. \"We finally threw out the kerosene lamps,\" m used an old-tim er. \"Electricity cam e along - we thought that was the greatest and m y first appliance was a washing m achine\" (Nunn 200, 21-22). Frisco residents began get ting televisions around 1960, but received only three channels . \"Every tim e the wind shif ted the picture would fade out and it'd all be a bunch of racket. W e never got to see the end of a movie.\" 7.6.9. Postal Service The post office was established in 1898, changing the nam e of the village from Trent to Frisco. The first postm aster was nam ed Wallace, an avid traveler who had shipwrecked off Hatteras Island and m arried a local wom an. W allace had been especially fond of San Francisco, and suggested that as a new na me for Trent W oods . The U.S. Postal Service, perhaps thinking that San Francisco was \"too long an d too pretentious for such a sm all hamlet,\" settled on Frisco (Wechter 1975, 180; Payne 1985). The short and easil y spelled \"Trent\" was discarded to avoid confusion with another Trent on the m ainland (P ayne 1985). Minnie Fulcher was postm aster Farrow's father poled the 16-foot juniper shove skiff that would m eet the mail boat each m orning and evening; he was paid $6 dollars per 277 7.6.10. Early 7.6.10.1. was known for its yaupon tea producti on, a beverage introduced to E uropean settlers by the Hatteras Indians. Yaupon is a m ember of the holly family and grows in abundance in coastal N orth Carolina. Abor iginal peoples along the coastal pl ain ritualistically imbibed not only the tea m ade from yaupon leaves but, also th e mildly toxic berries as well for purgative and emetic purification, hence th e plant's scientific nam e Ilex vomitoria . The Outer Banks colonists drank yaupon tea as a patr iotic substitute for British tea durin g the Revolutionary W ar. It was also popular as a staple on W est Indies ships as an \"antidote to scur vy\" (MacNeill 1958, m anufactured on H atteras Islan d until the early 1930s. John W hedbee processed yaupon tea in Fris co and turned the endeavor into industry. His daughter, Maggie Austin, exp lained that W hedbee would place the yau pon branches in a trough and \"twig\" it with a knife. Careful to remove the poisonous berries, he would then chop the twigs into sm all pieces with an axe. He would heat ballast stones in a fire and place y aupon and hot stones in a barrel or \"ho gshead\" in alternating la yers. The b arrel was buried in the sand and lef t for three days. On ce the yaupon was cured or \"sweated\" he would dry it on large ra cks in th e sun. It was bagged and sold for one dollar per bushel. He shipped six to eight bushels at a tim e across th e sound to Elizabeth City. Another tea m aker, Alonzo Stowe, would put the yaupon in a hol e in the ground lined with tin from fifty-pound lard cans . At the bottom of the pit were stones that he had collected on the beach, heated red hot. He would \"sweat\" the yaupon for a w eek, then dry it while turning it daily and covering it with canvas to avoid m ildew . Stowe sold yaupon tea for twenty-five cents 278 per gallon or fifty cents per peck; he did this for 11 years during his tim e off from the Coast Guard (W inslow 1979). Yaupon production peaked during the Civil W ar period when harbors w ere blockaded in the 20th century\" (Van Dolsen 1999, 6), although an el derly black m an ran a \"yopon factory\" in 1903 in Frisco (Stick 1958, 177). \"There wasn't a thing wrong with the peopl e,\" Whedbee's daughter rem arked, referring to the local a that deve loped against the brew. \"But it'd m ake them mad whenever you mentioned yaupon tea.\" Whedbee was one of two families in Frisco s till process ing yaupon in the 1930s (Wechter 1975). Today, in 2004, yaupon is processed occasionally by at least one family for personal consum ption. Investo rs from Norfolk built a large warehous e in Frisco aro und the early 1920s for the eel grass or \"sea oar\" in dustry as started in Avon by C.T. W illiam s. But, \"because of the scarcity of eel grass there, th ey so on sold out to W illiam s\" (Stick 1958, 234). Another product com ing from Trent and the Cape area was firewood. Villagers from Hatteras went to Frisco for chords of dry live oak and cedar that were cut from the surrounding forest and in Buxton's woods, selling anywhere betw een fifty cents to four dollars a chord before World W ar II. Bankers cam e down fr om Chica macom ico as well, for there were no trees on the northern p art of the is land to supply fam ilies with pine needed for cooking and heating . Frisco even m arketed firewood across the sound. Before fisherm en traveled to m ainland areas for pound net stakes, Frisco sold to Hatteras village fisherm en 16 to 24-foot long pine stakes for fifteen cents apiece. A windm ill in Frisco had the repu tation f or making \"the bes t meal on the island, \" and was run by the Rollinson family (MacNeill 1958 ). The site of the m ill was along th e soundside 279 shore, but b ecause of erosion the m illston es were, in the 195 0s, discovered several h undred feet out into the water. The Frisco mill, like o ther island m ills of the er a, was of the \"Ger man\" type rather than the \"Dutch\" model. It consisted of a \"huge sailed wheel\" on a large pillar and a \"massive outrigger beam with a wheel fi xed against the ground\" (MacNeill 1958, 94). With every shift of the wind the m iller ge ts down and rolls the beam ed wheel around until the hou se heads in to the wind. In the Du tch type the wo rks are fix ed on a tower and only the roof of it is turned to head the sail into the wi nd...that just wouldn't do in the winds that prevail around Cape Hatteras (MacN eill 1958, 94-95). A Trent resident recalled his father working carpentry, not \"by the clock\" but by the sun: \"You started at sunrise and you quit at sundown. They got paid $1.25 per day\" (Farrow 1976-77, 52). An inform al sense of tim e has not di sappeared on Hatteras Island, and newcom ers commonly com plain about native laborers who operate on \"island tim e\" and show up at \"all hours\" or not at all if the fish are running. 7.6.11. Commercial Fishing Frisco resid ents fished in the ocean out of Hatteras village, set nets in th e sound, or participated in the beach haul seine fishery. The Cape, off B uxton, has long been a choice spot for the dories to work (F igures 7.6..4-5). \"T hey'd row all up and down the beach, and when they'd c atch their f ish th ey would have to le ave them there,\" reported Belton Rollin son. \"Only means was t o get them by horse and cart over to the bay, what we called the Back Landing Creek.\" As the Cape itself presented a wide la ndmass to cross, the fisherm en would cart their catch over to the sound side at the th innest p art, the north end of Buxton from the ocean side to Back Landing Creek. Back Landing Creek was also known as Cape Creek. They did not transport the fish to Hatteras village via the ocean, as it was too rough, an d the buy-boats and fish 280 houses were in the Pam lico. \"They'd put them in boats and then sailed them to Hatteras to the fish m arkets\" (Baum et al. 1976-77, Figure hoto by B. Garrity-Blake. Figure 7.6.5. Dory Net Sign. Photo by B. Garrity-Blake. Frisco was the only village outside of Hatte ras v illage and Shell Cas tle (Ocracoke ) that housed a porpoise facto ry, worked by Trenter Jo hn Rollinso n and crew. It was an ou tgrowth of the Hatteras operation, as dolphins caught near the cape were diffi cult to transport to Hatteras 281 Village. \"In the 1880s J ohn Rollins on, Tom Fulcher, and J ames Stowe were im portant fisherm en who brought porpoises to the Trent factory where oil was extracted and hides prepared. A porpoise season us ually netted the fisherm en clos e to $5,000; the m anufacturers, $10,000\" (Wechter 1975, 178). The Trent factory did not operate as long as the Hatteras plant, and was probably a sm aller operation. Alvin Fulcher of Frisco still had som e hand- tied cotton fishing nets to show to Cape Hatteras school students in 1976. Each fisherm an had a stand of about twenty-five 30-yard cotton nets, before m onofilam ent wa s invented ci rca W orld War II. Fulcher used a hand-carved juniper net gauge and needle to m ake his nets , sewn around the woodstove during cold winter months. \"Once the net was tied it was attached to co tton lines,\" Cape Hatteras School students reported. \"The floats on the lines w ere made from genuine cork. There were no plastic or foam corks as there are today. To make lead weights, Mr. Fulcher poured the lead out flat and then cut pieces of it and wrapped it around the cotton lin es\" (Gray and Um phlett 19 76-77, 50). Fulcher said that he fished right off Fris co inside the reef , and typically le ft his fish by the roadside to be picked up by the m ail truck and deliver ed to the icehouse in Hatteras. In recent years a declini ng m arket was cited as a reason for dwindling numbers of fisherm en and shrinking fortunes. Imported products caused shrim p and crab to be sold at prices not seen in d ecades. A Frisco coup le, reminiscin g that they paid 39 cents for a bag of sugar, 25 cents for a pound of ha mburger, and one penny fo r five pieces of candy before W orld War II added, \"the only thing that isn't changed is [the price] we ge t for our comm ercial fish.\" 282 7.6.12. Hunting Villagers in island -wide reput ation for their waterf owl hunting skills, an d many \"market-hunted,\" selling commercial quanti ties of waterfowl to northern buyers. They consum ed shore birds and feasted on gull eggs in times of scarcity. They also hunted sm all white- tailed deer and rab bit in the wo ods of Buxt on and Frisc o. Village rs fished in th e fresh water ponds for bass as well. According to Roda nthe's legend of \"Old Buck,\" a hunter from Frisco woods shot the m ythical bull, ending the anim al's prolific reign of siring calves, and starting its mysterious role of appearing at Old Christm as each year. T his sto ry underscores th e reputation o f Frisco forest-dwellers as accom plished hunters. 7.6.13. Livestock and Gardening Frisco residents were no different than other Hatteras Islanders in keeping chickens, pigs, perhaps a dairy cow, and free-roam ing livestoc k. They were also known for keeping sheep. Frisco W oods m ay have been the hom e of Roda nthe's\" Old Buck,\" but Frisco villag ers had a flesh-and-blood bull to conte nd with: Old Albert. Between Hatteras and Frisco, we had an old bull out on the beach. They called him Old Albert. That sucker would chase you. W e had to watch for him when we was going. We kept watch on Old Albert. You see him plow the ground a little bit with his front feet, you better get out of the way. Cause he was com ing. People brok e horses by driving them into the o cean and climbing on their backs. \"You could stay on till they hit dry ground. Then they'd throw you.\" When the governm ent decided that they were losing the war on cattle ticks, and their dipping-vat policy was som ewhat of a failure, they worked to eradicate free ranging herds by offering a five-dollar bounty for each anim al. An islander nam ed Hall R oosevelt shot the last cow on Hatteras in 1938 with an old-model Spring field rifle f rom 800 yar ds away. \"The county 283 authorities solem nly paid him $5 dol lars, wh ich he casually handed to the CCC youth who had accom panied him on the hunt\" (MacNeill 1958, 70). Trenters cultivated sm all gardens, and enjoyed ri cher soil than the low, san dy areas of the island. A Hatteras resident recalled traveling to his uncle's in Fris co to get vegetables from his garden. People also walked up to Frisco to pi ck the abundant blackberries and wild grapes that grew in the area. The biggest m eal of the week was Sunday di nner, which would be prepared Saturday night. A villager wondered at the lack of refr igeration and little pr oblem with spoilage: Food didn't spoil back then lik e it does now-a-days. They'd cook fried chicken, potato salad and ice tea, and put it on the ta ble - af ter you eat, there was a cover put over it. Suppertim e, we'd take that cover off and get another plate and eat supper and it tasted just as good and didn't spoil. 7.6.14. Perceptions of Environment and Storms A Frisco villager sa id tha t she and he r husband ha d built on f amily property that they thought was immune to flooding, but that proved incorrect in 1993 during Hurricane Em ily. \"We got wiped out just about. W e had 42 trees dow n. It tore the back side of the house out. W e sit here in the [porch] swing and watched the trees pop off.\" Her cat was missing all day, but when they opened the door to let the rising tide wash through the house, he was hanging on the screen. \"He looked like he was about drowned!\" The fa mily attributed their unusual flooding event to the construc tion of a sizeable campground in Frisco, m eaning fewer trees and more hills to \"trap the w ater\" from flowing over the area back into the ocean or sound. They pointed out that the 1993 storm brought the first flooding to Buxton that people could rem ember, and linked that to dune construction. 284 Before tourism beca me rampant, villager s typically did not evacuate but simply took what precau tions th ey co uld and hop ed for the best: Most would batten down and weather it out. Back then you kept an eye on your barom eter and listened to your radio. A lot of the places had shutters, they would board up. If you had electricity you m ade sure you had plenty of kerosene for your lam ps 'cause you knew you weren't going to have no lights. An islander described the shift of wind that causes the sound to wa sh over the island; he attributed the building of sand dunes in the 1930s to incr eased flooding in the area: If [the storm] goes inland south of us, the wind moves around this way and it ends up north and th e ocean get rough, real ro ugh. It puts the water in the sound an d pushes it o n the other side sound. All of a sudden it gets real calm . The clouds are all gone for 15 or 20 m inutes and then the wind com es from this way, one hundred plus [m iles per hour]. That water com es back fast and floo ds the island. When they built these s and dunes in the '30s it w as the worst thing in m y opinion. The water, with the sand dunes, couldn't get to the ocean and that's what gave us such a high water. 7.6.15. Rituals and Community E vents Weddings in Frisco were sim ple affai rs, and of ten took place at an early age. \"I grew up with m y young'uns, I sure did,\" said a village wo man. A resident described getting married in 1953 at age sixteen, and had five ch ildren by the tim e she was twen ty-one. \"They were like stair steps,\" sh e said, \"But th e last were tw ins so they com e fast.\" Three of her children were born at a Buxton clinic; one daughter was born at the Navy Base in Buxton, and her twins w ere born in Elizabeth City. Her husband worked for the st ate highway departm ent for 62 cents an hour. Because they were lack ing in funds, their recreation consisted of loading the kids in th e back of a truck and h eading for the beach to fish and cook out. Frisco f amilies re call ea rlier Chris tmases tha t were marked with vis iting a nd feasting more than gif t-giving : 285 I rem ember pies and cakes Momm a would cook for Christm as, and she'd put them upstairs in one of our bedroom s that didn't have no heat. They had a long board that went across like shelves. Som ebody com e, alright young'un, go get one of them pies and bring it down. They'd always serve them a wedge of pie. Some decorated trees with popcorn and hung stocki ngs, but gifts were kept sim ple, reflecting both the scarcity of wealth on the isla nd and the sparse way of living: We'd get on e apple, one orange, two nuts, two or three little pi eces of hard candy, and that was our stocking. A nd, then we'd get one toy. Som etimes it would be a doll baby. But, it was always just one thing. A nd, we were just as happy with that as kids [today] getting half a liv ing roo m full. 7.6.16. Coast Guard and the Military Creed's Hill Lifesaving Stati on was built just so uth of Fr isco in 1878 on one of the larges t sand dunes in an area known as Stowe's Hills. Rock y Rollinson helped re-bu ild th e station in 1918. \"The Coast Guard has been one of the greatest assets of this place of anything I've ever known in m y life,\" said a F risco resident. This resident estim ates that, in 2004, \"75 percen t of the fam ilies right here all the way fr om Rodanthe to Hatteras is receiv ing a re tirem ent check or active duty check.\" The daughter of a lighthouse keeper recalled times when her father would be away for three m onths at a tim e tending the Diam ond Shoals Lightship. During these long stretches her mother, Maggie Austin, \"would sit a nd play with us, study with us. We could talk to her about anything and she always listened to us\" (N unn 2002, 22). Yet, her husband's long absences made for rough reunions: They spent thirty -six y ears of their m arriag e with George running his life apart from Maggie who was raising a fa mily. When they occupied the sam e house [whenever George was on leave] they engaged in a pow er struggle. Maggie was used to m aking decisions regarding the fam ily without input from George. George was used to giving orders and having them obeyed (Duncan and DiSabatino, n.d.) 286 7.6.17. Law Enforcement John Rollins on, born in Trent, had moved to Hatteras in 18 46 to teach s chool, and becam e a Justice of the Peace for Hyde County. Frisco was hom e to one of the first sheriff's deputies; Dewey Basnight. Later his brother Raymond Basnight followed suit. The latter was \"very popular with the sheriff's departm ent. He was chief deputy under F rank Cahoon, in Manteo, and Hatteras Island was his whole cup of tea. He run everything as far as law enforcem ent on Hatteras Island.\" 7.6.18. Modernity and Perceptions of Change A Frisco resident pointed out that touris m and developm ent, however overpowering, has provided em ploym ent to villagers an d allowed them to stay on the island to work as opposed to earlier decades when people were compelled to leave. It saddened him to see som e young residents not taking advantages of the opportunities that he would have appreciated w hen he was younger. All three of my children today can w ork and stay here on the isla nd and be with their family. W hen I was com ing up you couldn't do that. My son's doing contract work, he doesn't have to worry. My other son works for Coastal Concrete in Buxton, he doesn't have to worry. My daughter and her husband have several businesses. The sky's the limit with young people here on the Outer Banks . I'm almost afraid we're going too far with over building, and a lot of people cuss it , but at the sam e daggone tim e where would we be without it? You got to take the bitter with the sweet. He added that m any of t hose residents w ho com plain about growth and tourism are \"implants. They com e in from the outside and don't know what it was like before tourism got here.\" The increase in jobs has its downside, acco rding to a Frisco resident: \"Everybody's so busy - m ommas and dads are trying to m ake a liv ing. They are both working, and the kids are 287 doing pretty well what they want.\" Her husband a dded that developm ent \"i s the wors t thing th at ever happened to Hatteras Island.\" It destroyed our woods. It de stroyed our sound and everything else. More people. In the 30's and 40's you could go anywhere along th is shore-side and pick you up a m ess of oysters and clam s or anything you want ed to. Everything is polluted now. A contentious issue that fr actured the village of Fris co was zoning. One of the controversies surrounded a proposed go-cart trac k, com pelling som e residents to qu estion whether zon ing was in o rder along a vacant stretch of Highwa y 12. Divisiveness and disagreem ent doom ed the zoning proposal, how ever, which turned into a native versus newcom er conflict. I can see where zoning has got a lot of good points, there's a lot of things it helps. But, there 's a lot of things it d on't, so th e majority of the local people who were here in Frisco a long tim e was against it. W hen [people] firs t move here they talk about such a beautiful place. \"Oh, where we [lived] we can't wash our car in ou r yard, we can't do this, we can't do that.\" They m ove here and not si x months later they try to get ordinances passed. A Frisco wom an bemoaned the loss of secu rity that cam e from knowing everyone in the village: You didn't have to worry. W e never locked our doors until the past 15 years. Never took the keys out of your car. You left your sc reen door open every night and left your windows all open. You didn't worry about nobo dy com ing around becau se you knew everybody. Everybody on the island knew everybody else. Another sim ply missed her old friend s and fam ily, now deceased. \"Always got along pretty good,\" she mused. \"All of a sudden I woke up w ithout nobody to talk to - it's been a quick change.\" She was the oldest native in Frisco at eighty-eight, and added that \"I'm grouchy, tired, and disgusted.\" She was wary of the influx of vi sitors and new residents. \"There are too m any ants on this ant hill and I don't like it.\" 288As the nation's principal conservation agency, the Department of the Interior has responsibility for most of our nationally owned public lands and natural resources. This includes fostering sound use of our land and water resources; protecting our fish, wildlife, and biological diversity; preserving the environmental and cultural values of our national parks and historical places; and providing for the enjoyment of life through outdoor recreation. The department assesses our energy and mineral resources and works to ensure that their development is in the best interests of all our people by encouraging stewardship and citizen participation in their care. The department also has a major responsibility for American Indian reservation communities and for people who live in island territories under U.S. administration.
