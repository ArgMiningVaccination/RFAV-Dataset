Vaccine Research and Development: The Sabin Vaccine Institute supports innovative technologies and approaches in vaccine research and development to combat infectious and emerging threats to global health. Sabin's Research & Development strategy is to advance the development of vaccine candidates that have demonstrated early scientific value but have little commercial value, targeting diseases that impact the world's most vulnerable populations. Sabin leverages the expertise of partners in the academic, public, and private sectors, and promotes open-source research. Ebola has taken the lives of more than 15,000 people in the last many 8,796,004. 2,232,992. Global Immunization: Despite scientific advances and international support, 1.5 million people still die each year from diseases that could have been prevented by immunization. Sabin has a vision of a future free from such preventable diseases. Reaching this goal requires efficient vaccine distribution, broad vaccine uptake and equitable access to vaccination services. Through advocacy, capacity development and social, behavioral, and epidemiological research, Sabin advances evidence-based strategies for improved distribution and uptake of vaccines.
