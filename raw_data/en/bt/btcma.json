The staff and doctors truly care about peoples health and well-being and rather than just prescribing a drug that masks the problem the doctors will get to the root of the issue, which is often a nutritional deficiency, so they work with you!! You will be so glad you called sooner than later as new patient appointments are a number of months out!! Call today. Weekends you will get an answering machine, however they are very good about returning calls!! - 2/14/2013First to Review Dr. Georgia is fantastic! She just spent almost 2 hours with me going over my health and dietary concerns. She is professional, compassionate and very knowledgeable. Her experience with nutrition, homeopathy and alternative medicine is impressive and Madison is very lucky to have such a wonderful alternative health care provider.
