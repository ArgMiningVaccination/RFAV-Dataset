When describing these approaches, people often use \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" interchangeably, but the two terms refer to different concepts: - If a non-mainstream practice is used together with conventional medicine, it's considered \"complementary.\" - If a non-mainstream practice is used in place of conventional medicine, it's considered \"alternative.\" True alternative medicine is uncommon. Most people who use non-mainstream approaches use them along with conventional treatments. Integrative Medicine There are many definitions of \"integrative\" health care, but all involve bringing conventional and complementary approaches together in a coordinated way. The use of integrative approaches to health and wellness has grown within care settings across the United States. Researchers are currently exploring the potential benefits of integrative health in a variety of situations, including pain management for [military personnel and veterans](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/military-veteran), relief of symptoms in [cancer patients and survivors](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/cancer), and programs to promote healthy behaviors. Complementary Or Integrative? The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NICCIH) generally uses the term \"complementary health approaches\" when discussing practices and products of non-mainstream origin. NICCIH use \"integrative health\" when talking about incorporating complementary approaches into mainstream health care. Types of Complementary Health Approaches Most complementary health approaches fall into one of two subgroups\u2014natural products or mind and body practices. Natural Products This group includes a variety of products, such as [herbs](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm) (also known as botanicals), vitamins and minerals, and [probiotics](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/probiotics). They are widely marketed, readily available to consumers, and often sold as [dietary supplements](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/supplements). According to the [2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)](https://nccih.nih.gov/research/statistics/NHIS/2012), which included a comprehensive survey on the use of complementary health approaches by Americans, 17.7 percent of American adults had used a dietary supplement other than vitamins and minerals in the past year. These products were the most popular complementary health approach in the survey. (See chart.) The most commonly used natural product was fish oil. Ten most common complementary health approaches among adults: Researchers have done large, rigorous studies on a few natural products, but the results often showed that the products didn't work. Research on others is in progress. While there are indications that some may be helpful, more needs to be learned about the effects of these products in the human body and about their [safety](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/safety) and potential [interactions with medicines](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/herbs/understanding-interactions) and other natural products. Mind and Body Practices Mind and body practices include a large and diverse group of procedures or techniques administered or taught by a trained practitioner or teacher. The 2012 NHIS showed that [yoga](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/yoga), [chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/spinalmanipulation), [meditation](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation), and [massage therapy](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/massage) are among the most popular mind and body practices used by adults. The popularity of yoga has grown dramatically in recent years, with almost twice as many U.S. adults practicing yoga in 2012 as in 2002. Other mind and body practices include [acupuncture](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture), [relaxation techniques](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/stress/relaxation.htm) (such as breathing exercises, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation), [tai chi](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/taichi), qi gong, healing touch, hypnotherapy, and movement therapies (such as Feldenkrais method, Alexander technique, Pilates, Rolfing Structural Integration, and Trager psychophysical integration). The amount of research on mind and body approaches varies widely depending on the practice. For example, researchers have done many studies on acupuncture, yoga, spinal manipulation, and meditation, but there have been fewer studies on some other practices. Other Complementary Health Approaches The two broad areas discussed above\u2014natural products and mind and body practices\u2014capture most complementary health approaches. However, some approaches may not neatly fit into either of these groups\u2014for example, the practices of traditional healers, [Ayurvedic medicine](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/chinesemed), is the Federal Government's lead agency for scientific research on complementary and integrative health approaches. The mission of NCCIH is to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of complementary and integrative health interventions and their roles in improving health and health care. NCCIH's vision is that scientific evidence will inform decisionmaking by the public, by health care professionals, and by health policymakers regarding the use and integration of complementary and integrative health approaches.

For More Information NICCIH Strategic PlanNCCIH's current strategic plan, [>2016 Strategic Plan: Exploring the Science of Complementary and Integrative Health](https://nccih.nih.gov/about/strategic-plans/2016), presents a series of goals and objectives to guide us in determining priorities for future research on complementary health approaches. The scientific objectives in the plan are aligned with those of the broader [National Institutes of Health strategic plan](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/nih-wide-strategic-plan).
