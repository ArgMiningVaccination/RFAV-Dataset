Biodefense \u2014biological protection from harmful biological methods or objects. Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) \u2014the most effective and the most commonly used primary containment devices in laboratories working with infectious agents. Th ere are three general types available (Class I, II, III). Properly main tained Class I and II BSCs, when used in conjunction with good microbiologi cal techniques, provide an e ffective containment system for safe manipulation of moderate and high-ri sk microorganisms (bio safety level 2 and 3 microorganisms). Class II BSCs also protec t the research material itself through high- efficiency particulate air filtration (HEPA filtr ation) of the air flow down across the work surface. Class III cabinets offer the maximum protection to laboratory personnel because all hazardous materials are contained in a totally enclosed cabinet. Biosafety Level (BSL) \u2014there are four levels of biosafety used to designate and regulate lab work with microorganisms. The range is BSL- 1 in which the microorganisms are not known to cause disease in healthy adult human beings to BSL-4 in which the microorganisms pose a risk of life-threatening disease and for which ther e is no known vaccine or therapy. BSL-3Ag refers to research involving larg e agricultural animals. There are guidelines in place to ensure safe work sites through a combination of engi neering controls, management policies, work practices, and procedures. Increasing levels of personnel and environmental protection are provided for by the different biosafety levels us ed in microbiological/biomedical laboratories. The higher the level of the bi osafety lab, the more stringent the level of protection. Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) \u2014required for work with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of aerosol-transmitted laboratory infections and life-threatening disease. Highest level of containment for biological safety per the Biosafety in Micr obiological and Biomedical Laboratories guidance (a publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] and the National In stitutes of Health [NIH]; U. S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS]). Agents with a close or identical antigenic relationship to Biosafety Level-4 agents are handled at this level until sufficient data are obtained either to confirm continued work at this level, or to work with them at a lower level. Members of the laboratory staff have specific and thorough training in hand ling extremely hazardous infectious agents and they understand the primary and secondary containment functions of the standard and special practices, the containment equipment, and th e laboratory design characteristics. They are supervised by competent scientists who are tr ained and experienced in working with these agents. Access to the laboratory is strictly controlled by the laboratory director. The facility is either in a separate building or in a controlled area within a building, which is completely isolated from all other ears of the building. A specific facility operations manual is prepared or adopted. February 2008 iv NBAF Scoping Report Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) \u2014a document required of federal agencies by the National Environmental Policy Act for major federal actions that may significantly affect the quality of the environment. A tool for decisionm aking, it describes, analyzes, and compares the potential environmental impacts of the altern atives to accomplish the purpose and need to which the agency is responding. High Consequence Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) \u2014diseases not present in the United States that are capable of rapidly spreading and causi ng high numbers of deaths and/or devastating economic consequences (e.g., foot and mouth disease). National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) \u2014proposed facility that would address both current and future requirements in researc h, diagnostics, and trai ning for combating high- consequence agricultural threats. Research would focus on early development and discovery of vaccines and diagnostic tests for thes e important agricultural diseases. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) \u2014requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for major federal actions that may significantly affect the quality of the environment. In NEPA, the term \"environment\" encompasses the natural and physical environment (i.e., air, water, geography, and geology), as well as the relationship of people with that environment (i.e., health and safety, socioeconomic conditions, cultural resources, noise, and aesthetics). Plum Island Animal Dise ase Center (PIADC) \u2014United States (U.S.) laboratory for the diagnosis, research, and traini ng for foreign animal diseases . The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory is located at PIADC. This la boratory has the capability of diagnosing more than 30 foreign animal diseases and is responsible for educating veterinarians in the recognition and diagnosis of these diseases. The USDA Ag ricultural Research Service (ARS) operates a program focused on basic discovery and research of foreign animal diseases. The DHS scientific program focuses primarily on the advanced development of vaccines and other countermeasures. Zoonotic \u2014a term for diseases transmitted by animals to humans. February 2008 v Table of Contents (This page is intentionally left blank.) February 2008 vi NBAF Scoping Report 1.0 I NTRODUCTION 1.1 O VERVIEW This scoping report su mmarizes the public scoping process for the United States (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) pr oposed National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). Its primary intent is to summarize what DHS heard from the public in regard to the proposed facility during the scoping period. DHS is charged with the responsibil ity and has the national stewardship mandate for detecting, pr eventing, protecting against, and responding to terrorist attacks with in the United States. Thes e responsibilities of DHS as applied to the defense of animal agriculture are shared with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and require development of a coordinated strategy to adequate ly protect the nation against biological threats to the animal agriculture industry. Consultations between DHS and US DA on a coordinated agricultural research strategy, as called for in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 , have revealed an infrastructu re gap that must be filled by an integrated research, devel opment, test, and evaluation infrastructure for combating bio- and agro- terrorism threats. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate is responsible for filling the gap in our biocontainment infrastructure as defined by the related homeland security efforts of DHS and USDA. The proposed NBAF will enable DHS to fulfill its mission of detecting, preventing, protecting against, and res ponding to bioterrorist at tacks within the United States. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PI ADC) has historically conducted much of the research that would be conducted at the NBAF. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 recognized that protection of U.S. agricultu re is a critical element of homeland security and transferred ownership of PIADC from USDA to DHS in 2003. Recognizing the growing need for veterinary countermeasures to protect the na tion's agricultural sector and r ecognizing the limitations posed by the current PIADC facility to meet this requirement, Homeland Security Presidential Directive-9 (HSPD-9) , \"Defense of United States Agricu lture and Food\", directs that the \"Secretaries of Agriculture and Homeland Security will develop a plan to provide safe, secure, and state-of-the-art agriculture biocontainment laboratories that research and develop diagnostic capabilities for foreign animal and zoonotic dise ases.\" Furthermore, HSPD-9 requires that DHS, USDA, and others will \"accelerat e and expand development of current and new countermeasures against the intentional introduction or natural occurrence of catastrophic animal, plant, and zoonotic diseases.\" The Secretar y of Homeland Security is responsible for coordinating these activities. Based on bio- and agro-defense mission requirements, as well as facility limitations at Plum Island, such as aging Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) space and its lack of Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) space, the need was identified to enhance the U.S. Government's current research capabilities in the animal agricultural field to meet the re quirements of HSPD-9. DHS therefore began exploring potential sites, including Plum Island, for a proposed new national research and development BSL-3 and BSL-4 asset, the proposed NBAF. The publication in the Federal Register on July 31, 2007, of the Notice of Intent ( NOI) to prepare an environmental impact February 2008 1-1 Section 1.0, Introduction statement (EIS) began the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process for the proposed NBAF (Appendix A). Six alternative sites are being c onsidered for the location of the proposed NBAF (referred to as \"Action Alternatives\"), along with the \"No Action\" alternative. These alternatives will be evaluated in the EIS. The site alternative sites are: 1. Plum Island, New York (i.e., a new replacement facility) 2. Flora Industrial Park, Flora, Mississippi 3. Manhattan Campus, Manhattan, Kansas 4. Texas Research Park, San Antonio, Texas 5. Umstead Research Farm, Butner, North Carolina 6. South Milledge Avenue, Athens, Georgia Three of the six states (Georgia, North Carolina, and New York) have NEPA-like state statues. Compliance with the federal NEPA regulations is c onsidered compliant with the state equivalent. 1.2 P UBLIC SCOPING PROCESS DHS is preparing an EIS for the pursuan t to NEPA, as amended (42 USC 4321 et seq.), and in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) and the DHS's Policy and Procedures fo r Implementing the NEPA (FR Vol. 71, No. 64). The public scoping process is an integral part of NEPA complian ce and ensures considerati on of the full range of issues and alternatives that should be evalua ted and helps identify the potential for significant environmental impacts. The NBAF public scoping process will directly affect the development of the NBAF EIS, because the members of th e multi-disciplinary technical resource team preparing the EIS receive all pub lic scoping comments applicable to their section and will consider or address the comme nts as applicable in their respective sections. The NOI to prepare an EIS, published in the Federal Register on July 31, 2007, marked the beginning of the 60-day public comment period (July 31 through September 28, 2007), known as scoping, and announced DHS's intention to hold public scoping meetings. Additionally, DHS mailed postcards providing the NOI information to approximately 2,650 initial stakeholders on July 31, 2007 (Appendix B). The initial stakehol der database was provided by PIADC and was expanded to include relevant federal agencies, state NEPA points of contact, non-governmental organizations, and associations, as well as mailing lis ts developed by the potential site consortia. DHS also developed a web page at http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf where the meetings were announced and interested stakeholders could requ est to be added to the mailing list. DHS held eight public scoping meetings in the vici nity of each proposed NBAF alternative site and in Washington D.C. The meeting dates and locations are as follows: February 2008 1-2 NBAF Scoping Report August 22, 2007 August 23, 2007 Saybrook Point Inn Southold Town Hall Two Bridge Street 53095 Main Road (Route 25) Old Saybrook, Connecticut 06475 Southold, New York 11971 August 28, 2007 September 11, 2007 Kansas State University Marriott Plaza-San Antonio K-State Student Union 555 South Alamo Street Manhattan, Kansas 66506 San Antonio, Texas 78205 August 30, 2007 September 18, 2007 First Baptist Church South Granville H.S. Christian Life Center 701 North Crescent Drive 121 Center Street Creedmoor, North Carolina 27522 Flora, Mississippi 39071 September 20, 2007 September 6, 2007 The University of Georgia Grand Hyatt Washington Center for Continuing Education 1000 H Street, Northwest 1197 South Lumpkin Street Washington, D.C. 20001 Athens, Georgia 3060 In the NOI, DHS invited individuals, organi zations, and agencies, including minority, low income, disadvantaged, and Native American gr oups, to submit oral or written comments concerning the scope of the EIS. Comments coul d be submitted by mail, e-mail, fax, voice mail, or handed-in during the public scoping meetings. Meeting attendees were also afforded the opportunity to provide oral co mments, which were recorded by a court reporter. Commentors who provided contact information were automatica lly included in the stakeholder database to receive future NBAF information and public outreach opportunities. In addition to the announcement in the NOI, sc oping meetings were advertised in local newspapers prior to meeting da tes (Table 1-1, Appendix B) and consortia made outreach efforts in their respective locales. The DHS Press Office also sent press releases to the local media inviting them to cover the meetings. Because th e regional meeting held in Washington, D.C. was planned to reach a different audience, direct notifications were made by mail, and the congressional liaison for the DHS Science and Technology Directorate contacted their stakeholders via e-mail and phone. An open house held before each scoping meeti ng provided attendees the opportunity to view informational materials; talk informally w ith subject matter expe rts from DHS, USDA- Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and USDA-Animal Plant Hea lth Inspection Service (APHIS); and obtain forms and fact sheets to gui de them in fully participating in the NEPA process (Appendices C and D). In Texas, fact sh eets were available in both English and Spanish. During each meeting, the DHS NBAF program ma nager presented an overview of the NBAF EIS and DHS's approach to meeting its obligations under NEPA.

The majority of the time was devoted to the formal comment period, which was fac ilitated by a moderator who kept the process flowing to ensure anybody who wanted to sp eak was given the opportunity to do so. Additionally, posters were set up at each meeting and provided information on the meeting agenda, site selection process, the National Bio and Agro-Defen se Facility, biocontainment laboratories and facilities, Plum Island Disease Center, NBAF EIS alternative sites, and \"What is an Environmental Impact Statement?\" (Appendix E) . Some of the attendees provided written comments while at the meeting and some co mmentors handed in thei r prepared written statements. February 2008 1-5 Section 1.0, Introduction (This page is intentionally left blank.) February 2008 1-6 NBAF Scoping Report 2.0 C ATEGORIZATION OF ISSUES More than 1,350 individuals attended the eigh t scoping meetings, at which 292 individuals provided oral comments. In addition, more than 880 comment documents and voice messages were received, including some petitions and letters with multiple signatories, and when analyzed, yielded more than 3,870 comments categorized by subject (Table 2-1). All comments received during the 60-day comment period were given equal consideration. The key issues identified by scoping to be analyzed in the EIS per th e CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1501.7) and scoping guidance are contained in Table 2-1. Commen ts received after the comment period were considered, as long as it wa s practicable to do so. Comments received by DHS we re grouped by similar concerns into issue categories. The identification and categorization of individual comments is subjec tive, however every effort was made to ensure that all public input was carefully considered a nd placed in the most appropriate issue category possible, given the spirit and c ontext of each comment. The technical resource specialists preparing the NBAF EIS will review and address the comments in their respective technical issue categories, as appropriate, to en sure that the NBAF EIS benefits from the full import of the comments.

February 2008 2-5 Section 2.0, Categorization of Issues (This page is intentionally left blank.) February 2008 2-6 NBAF Scoping Report 3.0 S UMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS This section presents a summary of the commen ts by issue category, with specific examples provided for each issue category. Examples are gi ven because of the large number of comments received; however, all comments are uniquely identified and documente d as part of the Administrative Record. The examples presented were chosen to reflect the range of comments received in each issue category. In most cases , one example comment represents several other comments of a similar nature. The number of example comments shown for each issue category is not a reflection of the total num ber of comments for that categor y; rather, the number reflects a representation of the range of issues for each particular issue category. Issue categories are ordered alpha betically. Example comments with in each category appear in random order. Example comments are verbatim, meaning they are presented as the commentor provided; therefore they are shown in italics. Example comments are not edited for grammar or content. Occasionally, explanatory text is added, and is shown in regular text. If an example comment begins or ends mid-sentence or if portio ns of a comment are not included for brevity or irrelevancy, this is in dicated by three dots. 3.1 Accidents, Threat, and Risk Comments concerning accidents, threats, and risk were wide-ranging (e.g., they came from all sites) and broad in scope. Comments conc erning accidents included weather-related events, other natural disasters, and accidental release of pathogens into the environment. Many of the threat and risk comments were related to terroris t threats (e.g., the facili ty would be a terrorist target), both foreign and domestic; threats fr om disgruntled workers; theft; and security procedures in the lab (e.g., control and inventor y of reproducing pathoge ns, worker security procedures, etc.). Some questions were rais ed, and suggestions provided, concerning security features of the facility; others asked where funding would come from to pay for security. Many commentors provided examples of past accidents or breaches of security at other labs and institutions for consideration. Some of the local governments provided information about their abilities to handle accident and security situations. Both a detailed Consequence Analysis and a sp ecific Threat Risk Analysis (TRA) are being conducted for the proposed NBAF. These analyses cover a wide range of potential accidents, threats, and risks to the proposed facility in cluding the scenarios ra ised during public scoping. While the detailed Consequence Analysis will be included in the EIS and will incorporate in a qualitative manner the major findings from th e TRA, the TRA is a separate stand-alone document that is used to develop the detailed security plan as required by federal regulations. Because the TRA includes specific details associated with the se curity layout and facility design, the TRA document will not be included in the EIS. However, the potential adverse consequences that could arise from intentional acts such as theft, sabotage, or destruction at the NBAF, including pathogens or sensitive informa tion and technology, will be described in the EIS. The qualitative summary of the potential adverse consequences resulting from intentional acts is necessary to support the fi nal decisions related to selecting the final site for the NBAF, as well as the determination of whether the facility will be constructed and operated. February 2008 3-1 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments Specific details and results from the TRA will be in corporated into the final facility design and operational procedures as part of the overall security plan to mi nimize threats and risk to the facility. The Threat Risk Analysis is compliant with current NIH operational standards that have been established for other BSL facilities as identified in federal regulations. Placing a prime terrorist target in an area like this [Plum Island] could have disastrous consequences. ...we have been hearing in the media that we are overdue for a massive hurricane. If that should happen, aside from the lo cation of the nuclear plant and security and so forth, ... -it would just be a tragedy, a tragedy for the island, a tragedy fo r all of us living here in Southold. Post-9/11, hospital faciliti es throughout Georgia have come to recognize the nontraditional roles we play in serving the public, such as supporting the NBAF. I am concerned about a disgruntled individua l or somebody with an ax to grind and Athens paying the price... there was a disg runtled employee in Berkel, India, and thousands of people died there. It was tumic, a simple chem ical, but it killed a lot of people because the man was disgruntled. We would also wonder if we could expect federal funding for our security forces. I was very concerned when I saw the proposal with the drawing of the possible site to see that parking was shown right next to the building one side , the loading dock on the other side with no evidence of any effort to prov ide barriers to vehicular access that was not vetted and properly taken care of. I was a visitor at th e Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory site some years ago, and at that time they were just then figuring out that they needed to place barriers to prevent vehicles from crashing into the plutonium storage facilities. ... I'm not so concerned about accidents w ithin the facility...Those problems can be solved, but you need to protect th e facility against external attacks. The recent escape of foot-and-mouth disease fr om a British research facility that was thought to be safe emphasizes the dange rs of siting the NBAF in this location. Also there is the threat of this fac ility being a target by terrorist groups. Regardless of any precautions taken to ensure citizens' safety, I feel the installation would heighten our chances of being targeted by terrorists, either foreign or domestic. In September 2003, the U.S. Government Acc ounting Office (\"GAO\") published a report detailing safety and security failures and shortc omings at the existing facility at Plum Island. A few of the many examples presented follow: ... Striking workers sabotaged the water syst em on the first day of the strike; they could just as easily have sabotaged the steam pipes which are a key part of the decontamination process. .. ... 8 scientists from other countries were found working in the biocontainment area without completed background investigations. Plum Island management failed to maintain adequate control over who received copies of keys and master keys. What if there is a fire? What if there is a forest fire - in a prol onged drought of the sort this area is currently experiencing, the risk of fire is particularly acute. What if there is an ice storm, and employees can't get there for a we ek, as is common in this rural area? February 2008 3-2 NBAF Scoping Report During Hurricane Bob, Plum Island's power was out for nearly a day, and it's backup generators had been down for three months . For three days, only three workers were available to run the entire fa cility of hundreds of rooms and animals, trying to handle the wastes of large infected animals with a hand pump. While there is much discussion of the NBAF becoming a target for a spectacular sort of terrorist attack, there is a greater danger in stealth. The director of the Plum Island facility... has cautioned that pathogens are more difficult to secure than other materials that can be used as weapons, such as nucle ar material. There is no existing mechanism that can detect the theft of a small amount of disease mate rial. Once removed from the facility, that disease material can be grown and multiplied in secret. Many of the diseases which will be brought to the proposed facility can be turned into biological weapons. Just keeping an inventory list is difficult, because the diseases are as part of the research allowed to reproduce, or may be a ccidentally allowed to reproduce. North Carolina is nationally recognized for our expertise in emergency management with practical experience in both planning for and responding to emergency situations. As the former Secretary of Crime Control and Public Safety, I know that not only are North Carolinians committed to keeping our communitie s safe, but that our first responders are some of the best trained and prepared in this country. However sophisticated the proposed safety mechanisms may be, people make mistakes, natural disasters happen, and machines br eak. Actually, the more unique and sophisticated the machine, the greater th e likelihood of it breaking down, and requiring specialized service that may take some time to bring in. There will be accidents at this facility; workers will get comfortable, peopl e not familiar with th e systems will misuse them and they will break, and/or a number of ot her aspects of the se curity desi gn will fail. I heard a lot of fear of terrori st activity. Is this a reasonable terrorist target - that is, could a catastrophic event occur because of a breach in this site, and if so, what is the area of impact? A mile? 10 miles? Etc. Ho w many people are within that range? I would think terrorists would prefer to hit a site with a big impact. I'm having trouble seeing why this site would qualify. Stealing from the site and releasing it in a heavily populated area might have the biggest impact, but that is possible where ever the site is located .... If there is a classification for potential sites of te rrorists attacks, how w ould this facility be classified? The concept of a fool-proof fa cility has been tested with nuclear power plants. Most nuclear power plants have been safe most of the time. Three-Mile Island and Chernobyl are clear examples that no f ool-proof facility exists. Already we have seen how vulnerable our food supply and infrastructure is to attack from those wishing to do us harm, both inside and outside of our borders It is disingenuous to think a Plum Island-like lab will not be a target for terrorists. When Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmud was caught re d-handed in Kabul, Afghanistan, also captured was the sultan's dossier on Plum Island. We don't see any particular issues related to cataclysmic meteorolog ical or geological events. Southhold is surrounded by Plum Island, Millston e, Northville Tanks, Brookhaven Labs, and potentially LNG and in the event of an attack or failure, at anyone of these facilities, we won't stand a chance. February 2008 3-3 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments What about fire safety? Who will control lab fi res, the Helotes Fire Department? It was apparent that the Helotes Fire Department was overwhelmed within less than 24 hours when it attempted to fight the three-month long mulch fir e that began last December 25. Will the fire safety response be like that of Plum Island, a single dedicated fireman and a bucket brigade of employees who are supposed to sprint to the firehouse at the sound of an alarm? 3.2 Air Quality Air quality comments included both specific concerns , such as an increase in particulates, and general comments concerning degradation of air quality. One commentor had a suggestion for reducing air quality impacts. Concerns were raised about air pollutants from incineration, air pollutants from increased traffic, air quality tes ting and monitoring, and lowered property values and quality of life due to a reduction in air quality. Public concerns regarding air quality will be ad dressed in the EIS in a section devoted to air quality issues. This section will describe th e existing air quality at each of the proposed alternative locations and then describe how the proposed facility would im pact air quality during both construction and operation. The public may also want to review the Waste Management section of the EIS, which will describe methods of disposing of animal carcasses. These methods could include incineration, as well as ot her disposal methods. Similarly, the public may want to review the Traffic and Transportation se ction, which will address increased traffic from construction and operation of the fac ility and the associated impacts. If the waste is burned, as I understand, we're concerned about particulate matter. Our region, Athens, is in borderline attainment for particulate matter, and we're concerned that this would further stress our area. ...traffic would be increased many times over and with it air pollution. Additional tree cover on the unused portion of the site, trees in the parking areas, and vegetated roofs could also enhance air quality by reducing the heat island effect of the site. While this is unlikely to compensate for any discharges of air toxics from the facility, it should ameliorate the impac ts of vehicular traffic and normal HVAC discharges. The fact that you incinerate animals at 221,300 degrees or whatever temperatures that you incinerate animals, my con cern is the air quality that co mes as a result of that and how often is air quality testing done and wh ere can the average citizen obtain that information. I don't know that it's readily available. Will monitoring include composite air sa mples similar to those currently being performed by DHS at other locations? Will air monitoring include DNA analysis that will allow identification of all infectious materials housed in the facility? This area is primarily a farming community and as such depends heavily on its soil quality, livestock, plants, clean air and water for our community well being and livelihoods. February 2008 3-4 NBAF Scoping Report 3.3 Alternatives Comments about alternatives fell into three broad categories: Category 1 : Some commentors suggested choosing one of the other propos ed alternatives being considered in the EIS (e.g., the No Action Alternative or one of the alternative sites). Category 2 : Other commentors suggested alternative sites outside the range of the proposed alternatives considered in the EIS. Category 3 : Many commentors simply made a statemen t that they were either opposed to having the NBAF at their location or that they supported building the NBAF at their location. This was often expressed as a \"vote\" either for or against the facility at a particular location. Between the first two categories, more comments fe ll into the second category than the first. Many commentors suggested unspecified, but remote locations, away from population centers and in hostile environments. A few people suggeste d specific alternate locations. In terms of the third category, sometimes such statements were introductory remarks or cl osing statements in a letter, e-mail, fax, voice mail, or transcript that addressed one or more ot her issues. Many such comments were provided by community and industry leaders in support of their site for location of the facility. Chapter 2 of the EIS will address alternatives in detail. Included will be a discussion of reasonable alternatives, as well as alternatives that were initially considered but eliminated from further detail. The rationale for eliminating some alternatives will be described. The reasonable alternatives include siting the proposed NBAF at one of the six alternative sites under consideration and the No Action alternative. The site selection process will also be described. Category 1: Plum Island should continue to operate as a Bio-Safety Level 3[sic] Facility... (i.e., No Action Alternative) I like the No Action Alternative best. I think they ought to have it at Plum Island if they are going to have it at all. ...please not select Athens as the location for the facility and I would vote for North Carolina. I think its proximity to the research triangle woul d be beneficial. Texas seems like a better possibility. A refitting of the older facility on Plum Island makes more sense to us. Category 2: ...really think it's import ant to have this lab, but I think they should have built it in some secret location where nobody would k now where these pathogens are. I would urge you to accept our Governor's kind invitation to locate NBAF on the grounds of the Governor's mansion. I suggest it be put on an island somewhere wh ere there is little hum an contact other than the research staff and where there is little wild life to transmit any of the diseases being studied. February 2008 3-5 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments Put this facility either in an isolated area or in Washingt on DC where a ll the people who are worried live. There are many state-owned properties all over the State of Georgia that could suit such a NBAF facility. Almost all of them alre ady have the infrastructure required for the NBAF. The closing of military bases in Ge orgia, includes Fort McPherson (Atlanta's seventh largest employer with 4,141 jobs, the most of any of the four bases slated for closure in Georgia). Why could not one of these bases be the site for the NBAF? Why not choose a geographic location that is in hospitable to the growth of lab specimens outside of their building confines? ...why not consider locating the site on the old Dorthea Dix land, in Raleigh. ...it should be in a hostile environment wher e toxic leaks would ha ve trouble surviving, like arid desert or frozen ice lands. Build it underground in a wast eland area that is unpopulated. I would like to see a place like this in a more remote pl ace, like on a island or deep in a mountain ...it should be located on some remote island where the germs would have a natural quarantine rather than have it in th e heartland of cattle country. Consider location at Clay Center, Nebraska. Currently the USDA Meat Animal Research Center. Category 3: ...we are opposed to this faci lity being in our county. I fully support bringing the NBAF facility to our city... Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, I know you may hear from people not wanting you to relocate here but let me assure you that the majority of us would welcome ya'll with open arms. So, I'm definitely against that and would like to vote no. 3.4 Biological Resources Comments concerning biological re sources included specific conc erns about fish, bird, game, and botanical resources and their habitat. So me commentors questioned the impacts to these resources, impacts from both construction of the f acility and its operation, including effects from lighting and the potential releas e of pathogens into the wild game populations. Other commentors provided specific inform ation about endangered species. The EIS will include a section detailing biological resources at each of the alternative sites, including vegetation, wetlands, a quatic resources, wildlife, a nd threatened and endangered species. Information provided by the public duri ng the scoping process w ill be included, along with information provided by other federal, st ate, and local governments and other relevant sources. Concerns raised by the public about imp acts to these resources will be addressed in the impact analysis, including impacts from cons truction as well as operation of the proposed NBAF. February 2008 3-6 NBAF Scoping Report The proposed NBAF site lies directly between the two necessary components (the State Botanical Garden and Whitehall Forest - located next door to the site) of an Important Bird Area (\"IBA\"), designated by the Na tional Audubon Society. Therefore, the locating of NBAF here would degrade, disrupt and ot herwise diminish the continuous natural setting required for the IBA to exist. A designat ed IBA is a site that supports endangered or threatened bird species, including range restricted species, hab itat restricted species and species vulnerable due to congretory behavior. How can NBAF's intrusion with heavy construction, vehicle and human traffic and light and noise pol lution not seriously degrade or even destroy this fragile and critical IBA? I also, as a former employee of the state Botanical Gardens, adjacent to the proposed building site, would also like to voice my disapproval of that site because of the obvious botanical affects it would have. I'm concerned that noise and light pollution from the facility will disrupt migration patterns. The Oconee River also is critical habitat for the Altamaha shiner, Cyprinella xaenura, currently classified by the state of Geor gia as an endangered species. The Altamaha shiner is particularly vulnerable to habitat de gradation and poor water quality. The gray bat, Myotis grisescens, is on both the federal and state e ndangered species lists. Threats to this species include loss of insect prey over streams degraded by siltation and pollution. Impacts on the status of thes e species could be exacerbated by land disturbance during the construction phase of th e proposed facility adj acent to the river and by surface water withdrawals associated with the operati on of the facility. Our stock and trade is the tall grass prairie and the natural eco-system there, and this is way too dangerous and a bad location. Plum Gut is a significant coastal Fish and Wildlife Habitat...Significa nt concentrations of many species forage in this area, incl uding striped bass, bl uefish, tautog, summer flounder, and scup. Plum Gut is one of two major migration corridors for striped bass, which move into Long Isl and Sound in spring en route to their breeding grounds and return to southern over wintering areas during fall. Plum Gut is also thought to be the major corridor for Atlantic salmon returning to the Connecticut and Pawtucket Rivers in the early spring. This area [Long Beach Bay and Orient Point Marshes] is especially sign ificant as feeding areas for herons, egrets, and ibis, which nest on nearby Plum Island. The following at- risk bird species also util ize the habitat in this area: Roseate tern - casual visitor - endangered Northern harrier - threatened Common tern - threatened Common loon - special concern Sharp-shinned hawk - special concern Black skimmer - special concern Northern goshawk - special concern DHS must consider the effect that rebuildi ng and/or upgrading the fa cility will have on the fish and wildlife on the island and in the surrounding area. The site is very close to the Tar River which is the home of some endangered species. There are several natural areas, parks, w ildlife habitat and waterfowl migration areas (wetlands) immediately adjacent to the pr oposed site. How will they be affected? February 2008 3-7 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments There is one especially danger ous feature of the Butner si te which makes it an unwise choice. That is the close proximity of the Camp Butn er and State Gamelands. The Gamelands have a concentration of unfenced wild life, especially white-tailed deer. If there were such a release as has recently occurred at Pirbright, disease among the wild deer might not be discovered before wide spread and regional in fection. Amongst wild animals such an outbreak would be difficult to contain. The Research Park is located more than seven miles south of the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone and is not on the contribu ting [sic] or transitions endangered species habitat. Studies have been completed, and no golden-cheeked warb ler or black-capped vireo habitat exists on the property. In addition, the Re search Park lies in zone three, which is considered to be a low probability ar ea for the nine cave invertebrates listed as endangered in Bexar County. The 100 acres being proposed for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility is loca ted in the western section of the park. The proposed facility would be over 1/4 mile from any potential adjacent development. 3.5 Cultural Resources Comments concerning cultural resources ranged from simply encouraging consideration of cultural resources in the NEPA process to site-specific cultural resource. Following are examples that show both the general a nd specific nature of the comments. Cultural resource concerns will be addressed in the EIS, in compliance with both NEPA and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservati on Act. Cultural resource surveys have been conducted at each alternative site and potentially affected tribes have been consulted. Information provided during public scoping will s upplement these surveys and consultations. Potential impacts to cultural resources will be described as appropriate. How does DHS plan to deal with the enviro nmental, ecological, as well as habitat and archeological destruction and degradation caused by NBAF? An archaeological survey should be performe d and found historical resources should be excavated and safeguarded. Historic and cu ltural sites should be identified and construction in these areas avoided. Highway 441 (to I-20 to Atlanta) has been de signated \"Georgia's Heritage Highway\"... Quoting a page from the Georgia Departmen t of Economic Development's website, \"In central Georgia, you'll experience seven historic communities left virtually unscathed by the Civil War along the 100-mile trek that is Georgia's Antebellum Trail (which follows Hwy. 441)...\". If Highway 441 becomes know n as \"The Pathogen Highway\" instead, the economic benefits associated with this effort as well as the labors of many people involved in preserving this important part of Georgia's culture and history will be lost. From 1659 to 1898, Plum Island was populated by farmers. The island is an important part of the town's agricultural, military and maritime heritage which should be preserved. The island also has a lighthouse built in 1827...whic h was rebuilt in 1869...The lighthouse is now owned by DHS, whic h is cooperating with the East End Lighthouses and the town, which plans to acquire and restore the lighthouse. February 2008 3-8 NBAF Scoping Report The Town of Southold adopted a resolution on April 24th of this year encouraging the transfer of five acres to the Town for the separation of the light house for addressing the preservation issues. Fort Terry and the island's military structur es should be preserved and open to the public. According to the LWRP, \"many of th ese structures are considered suitable for listing on the National Register of Historic Places .\" DHS must consider the effect rebuilding and/or upgrading the faci lity will have on the cultural heritage and historic artifacts of Sout hold Town that still exist on Plum Island. My personal concern is for the stabilizati on and preservation of historic military buildings and artillery emplacements. 3.6 Design/Construction/Operation/Decommission Several members of the public raised questions or concerns about the design, construction, operation, or decommission of the facility. Comme nts related to design and construction had to do with public involvement in th e design process; expressions of confidence in the design and construction standards; quality concerns in the design and cons truction process; encouragement to build the facility following principles of en ergy efficiency, environmen tal sustainability, and architectural sensitivity; and interest in th e construction schedule. Comments related to operation were generally quite specific and dealt with topics such as management of the facility, the nature of the work to be done at the facili ty, and questions about possible safety features, such as a no-fly zone. Comments related to decommissioning were generally either encouragement to plan for the decommissioning of the proposed NBAF or questions about decommissioning of the existing PIADC facility. Preliminary design concepts applicable to all action alternative sites will be described in the EIS. General construction and operational procedures w ill also be described. While the NBAF will comply with all relevant design, construction, and operation regulations, ma ny details will not be determined until the EIS has been finalized and an alternative has been selected. However, if an action alternative is selected, DHS has committe d to developing a Community Involvement Plan to keep the local community informed and educated about the NBAF and its operation. I have confidence in the design of those la boratories, the inspection by biosafety personnel and the faculty and staff who accept the responsibility of the conducting of bioresearch within those laboratories. The bottom line is that any facility plan built, operated in accordance with current standards of operation for Biosafet y Level-3 and -4 fac ilities should be safe in this ... site. ...NBAF be designed, constructed and operated to meet the highest l evel of sustainable development under the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and that it m eet or exceed all federal, state and local environmental rules and regulations. ... present a REALISTIC detailed calendar of construction plans fo r the community's consideration. Explain how quality is managed and assured during each project phase (design, permitting, contracting, construction, opera tion)? Will the projec t be independently February 2008 3-9 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments audited? (Perhaps by community oversight, as suggested by the Mayor.) Do the independent auditors have any real authority, or are they merely \"window dressing\"? And most importantly: neither the University of Georgia nor Athens nor its citizens will have ANY control or input over what DHS ultimately does with NBAF or how it is managed. Will the scientific work performed at NBAF be published or will it be classified? Since the facility falls under the purview of DHS, w ill research be kept from the public in the interest of national security? How transparent will NBAF be? Plum Island currently houses The North American Foot and Mouth Disease Bank which keeps vaccine for the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Will the Vaccine Bank be moved here? What kind of biological agents will be involved in this federal facility? What specific guidelines will be used when dealing with pathogens of various kinds under the direction of scientists? What is the nat ure of the bio-kinetics research project in this facility? Will there be a no-fly zone around the facility? The Draft EIS must assess the costs associated with decommissioning and decontaminating the facility at the end of its useful life span, whenever that may be. Those costs should be weighed against th e alternative of abandoning the Plum Island facility after 50 years. What is to become of the Plum Island faci lity? What forethought is being given to prevent the same obsolescence as with Plum Island, 50 years from now? What will happen to this building in 50 years when it becomes not available for upgrades? Will we be stuck with a gi ant concrete hulk stuck in the ground? 3.7 Environmental Justice Issues concerning race and lower- income and institutionalized popul ations were expressed by the public. General racial issues were brought up, as well as the per ception that various unrepresented populations would be used as \"hum an guinea pigs\". Income-related issues ranged from concerns that lower-income populations would not benefit from the project in terms of jobs to support for the project because it would bring jobs. Concern was expressed that institutionalized populations, as well as youth and elderly, were not being considered. The EIS will have a section addressing enviro nmental justice in accordance with Executive Order 12898. In addition to information provided through the public scoping process, data will be obtained from the U.S. Census of Population and Housing on racial and ethnic characteristics, percentage of minority population, and low income population. This information will be used to assess whether adverse effects, if any, will be disproportionately borne by minority or low- income populations. Most people here are white middle-class, upper-class Americans. What about all the other sectors involved? I heard from somebody at AT&T earlier that said... you're right, th e poor people, they're not going to get the jobs over there. He said it. We all know it. He just sat right over there and said ... -- the jobs are not going to go to the people low down. February 2008 3-10 NBAF Scoping Report The proposed site is in very close proxim ity to several public schools and a large population of youth and elderly, whose health and well being are at the greatest risk. how about the diversity of our region, we'r e black and white, we're Hispanic and Asian. ... So I suggest to you that the diversity of our region as a fair factor to consider. We don't want or need this lab! Please read this article and you will see that the black community in the Flora area does not want it either. (Some in Flora allege racial discrimination- see http://www.clarionle dger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070924/ NEWS/709240349). ...I'd just like to let you people know up there doing the Scoping that Flora, Mississippi is having a big racial issue right now and 150 Bl acks marched on City Hall last night. If you call the Mayor, he's going to deny it, but if you go to wlbt.com and click on their site, I'm sure they've got it reco rded. They showed it on TV la st night. They're going to boycott the town, and I don't want it in Flor a, and I grant you, ya'll don't want it in Flora with all these racial issues. So keep it out of here. ...somebody made the question, \"Why couldn't th is be in Raleigh?\" My question is why can't it be in Granville County? Why -- Wake County gets all the job opportunities. We - the (audience applause) disparity between rich and poor is huge, this is now our opportunity. ... but the site is -- clearly is in a populated watershed and nat urally raises suspicions if one of the attractions is easy access to human guinea pigs. Butner has probably the U.S. aggregate of black population largely institution alized and not present here tonight. And our relatively poorly educated captives of one sort or another, prisoners, juvenile delinquents and mental patients una ble to give truly informed consent of their own free will; captives powerless to prevent or even like the victims of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, likely to be unaware of being inf ected with contagious debilitating diseases... But if using -- even if using human guinea pigs is not the intention, the temptation exists. And biological weapons research should not be conducted cheek by jowl with institutionalized populations similar to those used by Josef Mengele and his colleagues. If built here, the entire world would reasonably suspect that the U.S. military and other agencies will again be using adults and under age captives as human guinea pigs for biological warfare research. It has to do with environmental racism . And by that I mean we have many, many populations which are captive audiences so to speak, or captive ci tizens in the mental health facility, in the prisons, both state and federal and the retarded institutions (words inaudible), and I do think that this really ne eds to be looked at. There's something humanely wrong about putting this facility in an area with all these captive populations, and I do mean captive populations. 3.8 Geology and Soils Comments received concerning geology and soils included a note that steep slopes and bedrock occur near the surface at the Ge orgia site, therefore construction concerns were raised regarding soil erosion and blasting of bedroc k. Suggestions were also made to minimize soil erosion. One commentor noted that the soils at the Georgia site are classified as prime agricultural soils. Seismic concerns were also expressed. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) office February 2008 3-11 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments noted federal minerals need to be identified an d managed in New York; this would be true for the other sites as well. The EIS will include a section de scribing the geology and soils at ea ch of the alternative sites, including information on earthquake s and their potential for occurr ence at each proposed NBAF site, as well as soils found at each site. Additional informati on addressing earthquakes will be included in the Consequence Anal ysis section of the EIS. In formation provided by the public during the scoping process will be included, along with information provided by other federal, state, and local governments and other relevant sources. Concerns rais ed by the public about impacts will be addressed in th e impact analysis, in cluding impacts from c onstruction (e.g., soil erosion) as well as operati on of the proposed NBAF. The magnitude of earth disturbance will result in a substantial am ount of soil erosion and subsequent siltation and pollution of th e Middle Oconee River. The slopes from the site to the river are 20 to 25 percent in some areas. The United States Department of Agricult ure Soil Survey of Clarke County, Georgia shows that much of the proposed site is comprised of \"Pacolet sandy clay loam,\" ranging from 6-15 percent slope, is highly eroded and typi cally, the subsoil extends to a depth of only 39 inches.\" Not only would the building require blasting of bedrock, all other subsurface infrastructures would likewise. ...we're on an earthquake fault line, the New Madrid Fault. The 66-acre site proposed for the NBAF sits on land designated \"P rime Agricultural Soil.\" That means that of all the land in the state, that site has the most suitable for producing crops. American [sic] needs food and mo st of it comes from crops. Rather than growing our crops on poor soil and then dumping tons of fertilizer on soil that is not fertile or arable, we should preserve and protect \"Prime Agricultural Soil\" for its highest and best use -- the production of agricultural crops. Such sites should not be used for non-agricultural purposes. The U.S. Geological Survey places the propose d site within a zone of seismic risk corresponding to M max of 7.5 (maximum moment magnitude). According to the USGS, \"This large M max was motivated by the magnitude of the 1886 Charleston event (M7.3, Johnston, 1996b), since the workshop participant s felt such a large event could not be ruled out in other areas of the extended crust [Note: includes the entire northeast Georgia region].\" Plans for the proposed fa cility should consider the current USGS seismic risk calculations and an ticipated increased constructi on costs to meet this risk. If Plum Island, NY is selected for the NBAF, the federal mine rals needs to be identified, impacts from the proposal and cumulative impact s to the federal minerals needs to be identified, and a federal mi nerals management plan needs to developed with BLM's participation in the EIS. It is my experience and testimony that those individuals celebra te the opportunity to bring this national laboratory to San Antonio, Texas, where it will be safe from earthquakes... February 2008 3-12 NBAF Scoping Report 3.9 Government Intentions and Capabilities Several commentors expressed doubt about the inte ntions of the federal government in general and/or DHS in particular. The nature of the comments ranged fr om the public's perception that \"secret\" work would be conducted at the NBAF, to lack of transparency, accountability, and competency. To address concerns about govern ment intentions and capabiliti es, DHS has developed a public participation plan, which included the scoping process, in accordance with NEPA and other applicable regulations. Through implementation of this plan, th e public will be given further opportunity to ask questions and meet with offi cials from DHS at public meetings during the draft EIS review process, as well as have th e opportunity to review and comment on the draft EIS. Furthermore, the EIS will describe in deta il the work to be conduct ed the NBAF. Finally, if an action alternative is selected, DHS has committed to developing a Community Involvement Plan to keep the local community informed and educated about the NBAF. Through these public outreach efforts, DHS intends to build community trust and address concerns about government intentions and capabilities. DHS must comply with treaty obligations of The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (BWC) as ratified by the United States Senate on March 26, 1995, which prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons. Further, the U.S. Code Title 18, Part I, Ch apter 10, Section 175 provides for fines and/or imprisonment for whoever knowingly develops, produces, stockpiles, transfers, acquires, retains, or possesses any biological agent, toxin, or deli very system for use as a weapon, or knowingly assists a foreign state or any orga nization to do so, or attempts, th reatens, or conspires to do the same. I'm afraid this government has abused its ci tizens' trust and lied to accomplish its goals. It's imposed its will upon us and ignored our protests and broken laws and kept things secret, citing national security needs. Once this lab is built, there will be nothing to stop it from changing to work on even more dangerous viruses like Ebola, anthrax and smallpox if they want to, and we won't know about it, even if we have a citizen council. One thing that we have learned over the past few years is the only thi ng that we can trust about our Federal Government is that you can't trust it. ...the executive department in particular has shown a disdain for the rule of law. It has shown a disdain for transparency, and it's shown an avoidance of accountability. This administration and the Dept. of Homeland Security have, unfortunately, not earned the trust of the people of this country. Indeed, I propose that you have earned our distrust and therefore I can't believe anything you say about the sa fety and operation of this facility. I do not trust the competence of Homeland Security This government branch is certainly not known for being open and transparent in its business. I think there is a real trust issue wi th [D]HS [sic]. We were told that everything that went on in the facility would be public r ecord but I have to say that I cannot believe February 2008 3-13 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments that. If [D]HS [sic] wanted to do secret rese arch they would do so and the city of Athens would not be told. The development and operation of the NBAF by the Department of Homeland Security raises troubling questions of secrecy. In 2001 representatives of the Unite States blocked the development of verification protocols wh ich were in progress under the international Biological Weapons Convention. Subsequent progress appears to have been stalled in order to conceal our biologi cal defense program. Moreover, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 which created the Department of Ho meland Security gave the agency special protections from public inquiry and free information flow. The Homeland Security Act created an exemptio n from the Freedom of Information Act for DHS which eliminates the right to obtai n existing, unpublished records. ...As a result, legitimate scientific inquiry and peer-review are stifled I don't trust oversight, particularly under the current administration. I feel as though many things have been lacking in accountabi lity so it's hard to trust anybody telling me that this will be secure and that will not be a problem and that we should trust them. 3.10 Human Health and Safety Many commentors expressed a wide range of concer ns about human health and safety in regard to the facility. A large number of these concer ns had to do with public health effects in surrounding communities should an acci dental (or intentional) releas e of pathogens occur. Other concerns related to lack of vaccines, potential contamination of the food supply (including game meat), and the impacts of a potential releas e of pathogens on vulnerable populations. One commentor raised questions about the possibility of a quarantine in the event of a release, and the impacts associated with quarantine. Some comm entors noted that the risks to communities are low due to the latest technologies used, and still others provided information about the abilities of their local public safety responders to respond to a release incident. A detailed Consequence Analysis is being condu cted for the proposed NBAF, which will address potential adverse consequences to human health and safety that could arise from release of pathogens. This information will be included in the EIS and will be used to support the final decisions related to selecting the final site for the NBAF, as well as the determination of whether the facility will be constructed and operated. Release of a disease is potentially much mo re devastating to human health than even the mass radiation contamination from Chernobyl. On e thing that is certai n from the study of ecology of disease and in species: Once an unw anted disease becomes established, if it will happen, it will spread. The health and safety of residents in the su rrounding areas of Plum Island is of primary concern. A 2003 investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that a culture of lax and i nadequate security, safety and en vironmental practices could result in potentially lethal consequences... The Town of Southold is above all concerned about the safety of its citizens, and the proposal to increase the Biosafety Level of Plum Island to the highest level could pose a significant threat to that safety. February 2008 3-14 NBAF Scoping Report ...By changing the nature of the facility to ca rry a higher security level..., we will be permitting the study of zoonotic diseases - di seases transmitted from animals to humans - that could prove highly dangerous to surroundi ng populations. At this time, there is no other facility in the world equipped to study these dangerous diseases that could put both humans and livestock at risk. ...this particular community here on the east en d to some of the risks that a Bio-Safety Level 4[sic] facility could pose where you're studying diseases that have no vaccines to prevent them and no known cures is really put ting us as at a very, very high risk. The biggest issue we face is, as we're deali ng with things such as SARS pan flu and other diseases, is that piece of surveillance in bei ng able to pick up an agent while it's a needle in the hay stack and then be able to put th e intervention and comm unication strategies industries forward to pre vent it from becoming a public health catastrophe. The Health Department also works with m any other agencies invo lved in ongoing animal surveillance. These systems detect the possi bility of unusual animal death or disease trends which may be a seminal indicator of human disease. They include surveillance methods for livestock, wildlife, and aquatic species. Since the National Bio and Agro- Defense Facility will be dedicated to the study of animal and zoonotic diseases, these cooperative arrangements for surveillan ce communication and ac tion should provide great assurance to the San Antonio community. A virus or something can have our health or our kid's health. It's 100 % is too much risk. we ... understand the need to protect our food supply and the public health. Kansas is not only the bread bas ket of the country but also a large producer of our meat. It makes no sense to import deadly pathogens this close to our f ood supply and our local residents. To bring diseases into this country that are not already present is inexcusable. They should be studied in facilities and locations in which they alre ady exist. To bring foreign animal diseases into the heart of this live stoc k-rearing region is irresponsible. To bring zoonotic diseases to a facility built next to an elderly assisted living center such as this proposal would do, here in Manhattan, Kansas, is homicidal negligence. My main concern is how a release or a disast er would affect the day-to-day living of what is going on now. The facility proposes signific ant quality of life issues, including specif ic health and community safety issues. ..to think of housing so many dise ases in a facility near thou sands of students who travel nationally and internationally gives rise to serious concerns regarding epidemics as well. I would like to ask that th e EIS address whether under any circumstances a quarantine would be established and what the impact of -- on the community would be if quarantine is implemented. I am raising my children in this commun ity because I believe it is a good place to do so...I feel that housing the worlds deadliest diseases and developing further ways to harm innocent people is all around bad for this country. It is a case of the danger of the research being greater than the threat of whatever is being researched. The current labs have had enough safety breaches to make me very sure that this type of technology needs to be kept away from populated areas. February 2008 3-15 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments There are a lot of hunters in that area as we ll who eat the meat from the animals they catch in order to survive. It is extremely dangerous, and because UNC Hospitals is one of the largest transplant centers in this state, and there are many (including my daughter) who have received transplants there, this program is not an option in this stat e. People with transplants are immunocompromised and cannot fight off diseases. It will not benefit the community. Instead, it places us in severe danger, and poses severe hazards for us, and I am greatly opposed to it and do not want to see it come here. As a small dairy goat and horse farmer, of cour se I have significant concerns that the full range of disease organisms to which they and human populations coul d be vulnerable, and their variants would be appropriately filt ered and monitored in air, stormwater and wastewater from the site. ...operate a containment laboratory that will do just that; contain 25 the pathogens that Homeland Security proposes to research at the NBAF. Using the latest technologies developed and proven in many countries, it is possible for people to do work safely with these micro-organisms so that they, their families and other community members do not become ill; and a surroundi ng environment is mainta ined uncontaminated. I feel that it could be a major health risk for the people being so close to the town. If something was to go wrong and the diseases started spreading through the town, it could result in many deaths. I feel that health is much more important than money. 3.11 Infrastructure Some members of the public raised questions or provided comments about infrastructure. These comments included both utility and business infras tructure. Some commentors from all sites touted the infrastructure they have in place a nd investments that have been made to support the facility. The EIS will include a section on infrastructure, wh ich will describe utility infrastructure needed for operation of the NBAF, as we ll as existing utilities availabl e at each alternative site to support the operation of the NBAF, including potable water supply, electrical power, natural gas, sanitary waste water treatment facilities, and stor m water. Additionally, for each alternative site, the EIS will evaluate impacts to the infrastructure and note if existing facilit ies are adequate, or if upgrades, repairs, or new fac ilities would be needed. That work, I believe, would dovetail nicely with the research infrastructure already in place here in this great city. ..., this facility has the potential for a high-level consumption of natural resources, including water and energy...[sic] unless energy use is minimized and efficiency goals such as LEED Platinum standards are set and met, this facility will consume a large amount of energy, contributing to the widespread impacts from energy generation. I am opposed to this because I am so concer ned about the energy use, the noise levels, the impact that all this has in terms of property values. We urge DHS to design and constr uct this facility to minimize energy use. The facility should be built to LEED Platinum standards . (A new CDC labor atory just received February 2008 NBAF Scoping certification- see http://fe10.news.re3.yahoo.com/s/prweb/2000918/ /prweb554543- resulting in signifi cant cost savings as well as environmental benefits.) ...we committed some $7 million just for the pub lic infrastructure of the research park. Beautiful location. Proper running of that park, as well as the infrastructure that services close to that park, an ideal location for this facility. 3.12 Land Use and Visual Resources Most comments related to land use and visual resources tended to be informative comments, notifying DHS of local land use regulations, zoning ordinances, and resolutions passed in regard to the project. Others noted conflicts with local land use regulations. Still other commentors noted adjacent land uses and their compatibility, or lack thereof, with the proposed facility. Some noted current land ownership. Comments were received regarding visual resources, including aesthetics and impacts from lighting. Some commentors were co ncerned about visual impacts to the existing ru ral viewshed. Other commentors were concerned about lighting at the facility (necessitated by security concerns) and the associated light pollution. The EIS will include a section on land use and visual resources. In this section, existing land uses and visual resources at each alternative site will be describe d. Local zoning regulations for each site will be listed in Chapter 4. Potentia l impacts, such as land us e conflicts (if any) and changes in aesthetic qualit y, will be addressed. I see several problems with the pr oposed Milledge Ave. site. First of all, it is in the county ordinance Greenway Zoning area which would not allow for such a large structure. I would like to register my opposition to the NBAF in Athens on land-use grounds. I think the facility is not in keeping with the land-use principles Athens-Clarke County has adopted. I think that the change in the land use is a problem. In my opinion, viewed from South Milledge Avenue and Whitehall Road, the site proposed for the NBAF possesses as fine scen ic qualities as I have found anywhere... The proposed NBAF location is one of the most beautiful, pastoral, famously well loved and very visible vistas in Athe ns/Clarke County. T hat the Georgia Consortium could offer to DHS that \"the property can be fenced and a single gate and controlled access road constructed\" is ABSOLUTELY ABHORRENT to many people. There is no question about this proposed NBAF site being a BLIGHT on our landscape. The line-of-sight view of the proposed facility could not be more prominent unless it was elevated on stilts. The facility will be sited at the crest of a prominent hill with little screening from public view. Also the rural vi ew-shed now afforded by the site will be permanently destroyed by placement of the NBAF there. The proposed site is a beautiful hillside which now is used by the University as a horse enclosure. It's one of the most beautiful site s in the area and I drive by it every few days. It's a long sweeping hill curving down toward s the Oconee River. It would be a shame to replace it with a huge building surrounded by pa rking lots and fences, not to mention the halogen lights that would remain on all night. February 2008 3-17 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments Illuminating the facility, every night all night, with high-intensity lighting appropriate for a high-security facility will create an extensi ve amount of light pol lution. The facility would be better suited for placement in an existing industrial park away from neighborhoods, public parks, and rural lands. We don't want your light pollution... ...we right now are developing a regional growth management plan, and we're addressing on a regional basis housing, schools, transportati on, workforce, child care, health care. Actually every item that was on your EIS, to include the fact that we've already accomplished a regi onal joint land use study. City of Madison, Mississippi Resolution. WHEREAS, the Flor a Industrial Park, located in Flora, Mississippi, is one of the three sites in the State of Mississippi be ing considered for the proposed new National Bio and Agro Defense Facility (NBAF); and WHEREAS, the Madison County Economic Development Author ity, in an effort to attract the NBAF, has offered approximately 150 acres of hi gh quality developed indus trial park property... As federal land, Plum Island is not subject to New York St ate coastal zone controls. However, the Town of Southold has adopted a state Local Waterfront Revitalization Program (LWRP) to preserve its environm entally-sensitive land and its waterfront resources.In order to protect the fragile envi ronment of the town and fully consider the environmental impact of rebuilding the pr esent lab and/or upgrading it to a Bio-Level Safety-4 facility, DHS must consider and study the Town of Southold's LWRP and its rules and regulations. Plum Island is located in the mi ddle of a huge residential area. Although the research park is not within the city lim its of the City of the San Antonio, the park is located within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, therefore subject to the city's code. As a result, the Research Park has a working master plan approved by the City of San Antonio... Its security lighting should be designed fo r maximum efficiency and to minimize light pollution. 3.13 Mitigation In regard to mitigation, a few commentors suggest ed mitigation measures for construction due to the potential for soil erosion on steep slopes. Other mitigation comments were general in nature, requesting mitigation plans for each type of impact. Mitigation of potential impacts can occur in a variet y of ways, such as compliance with federal, state, and local regulations (e.g., air emission controls, so il erosion controls, etc.) and incorporation of mitigation measures into projec t design (e.g., security measures). The EIS will identify federal, state, and local regulations applicable to construction and operation of the facility. Additionally, the desc ription of the proposed action and alternatives will include measures that are intended to mitigate impacts and plans that are yet to be developed (such as Standard Operating Procedures). This is a really large site on a steep sl ope very close to the river... During the construction of the facility, th ere's a great potent ial for erosion and sedimentation of the February 2008 3-18 NBAF Scoping Report river, impacting habitat and downstream commun ities. Unless mitigated by low-impact construction techniques such as erosion and sedimentation control plans and best management practices, proper siting of bu ildings, minimize gr ading, maintenance of riparian buffers, and adherence to Athens-Clarke County's tree ordinance, the construction of this facility will negatively impact the river. Alternatives, mitigation and monitoring plans fo r each type of impact should be included. Explain how the five (or six) site finalis ts will be compared, and how much weight various factors will receive in choosing th e final site, including what factors would contribute to a No Action option for any or all of the sites. A mitigation plan for impacted cultural resources should be provided. 3.14 Noise Impacts from increased noise levels, both from c onstruction and operation of the facility, were expressed as a concern by commentors. Commentors were concerned about the impacts of increased noise levels on w ildlife and nearby populations. The EIS will include a section on noise. It will address existing noise levels at each alternative site and identify noise impacts from construc tion and operation of the proposed facility. This is an area that's extremely sensitive to wild life and having lights on, and noise 24/7 will completely disrupt the various populations there. Also, there's obviously going to be the noise in an area that's basically where people are going to be quiet. ...this means massive amounts of runoff and so il erosion, noise, light, air, and water pollution at the botanical gardens. We do not want the increased noise, light, air polluti on or traffic that would be part of the lab's impact. This facility is not in keeping with the rural, quiet and peacef ul nature of the area. It will cause additional uncontrolled growth and developme nt with a concurrent loss of natural resources and wildlife habitat; additional pollution to the air, water, land and noise level. 3.15 Purpose and Need for the Project Many commentors made statements about the pur pose of and need for the NBAF. Commentors noted that the purpose and need for the NBAF in cludes protection of our agriculture sector and food supply from foreign diseases and terrorist th reats, protection of human health from zoonotic diseases, scientific research, and development of countermeasures against terrorist threats. One commentor also noted technology transfer as a pur pose for the facility. Some commentors stated that the facility is not needed, a nd increases the risk of terrorism rather then helps prevent it. The first chapter of the EIS will address the purpose of and need for the facility. It will include background information on the aging PIADC, the responsibilities of DHS, the mission of NBAF, and the threats to U.S. agriculture from foreign diseases. February 2008 3-19 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments Since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Cent er has been doing its part to protect our agricultural sector from foreign animal disease. The research and vaccine development which has taken place for more th an half of a century has proven critical to the safety of American agriculture and is vital to the e nduring efforts to ensu re the quality of our nation's food supply. Those (BSL-3 and -4 faciliti es around the country) being built, including the proposed NBAF, may increase our risk of bio-te rrorism rather than help thwart it. There is a need for new facilities for the study of foreign animal diseases that may impact the U. S. agricultural economy with the capacity to study th e zoonotic potential of those diseases for which humans are at risk as well. ... we feel strongly the fa cility must be constructed to protect our nation. Both of my children have chosen scie nce as their field of study and would welcome the opportunity to work in a facil ity like NBAF that will utilize their knowledge while allowing them to make a significant contribution to our nation - helping with national food security and protecting our public health. Pests or diseases can quickly spread through stockyards, feedlots or crop fields and devastate important parts of our food supply chain within weeks or months. These pests or diseases could be brought to into our c ountry by terrorists or through international trade, which brings more foreign agricultural products to America each day. Either way, we urgently need the type of resear ch that will take place at the NBAF. What you're doing with Homeland Security is to save our lives, and we want to be here and help. As I understand it, the role of the NBAF is to develop the capability to detect, prevent, protect and respond to agricultu ral and biological threats with in the United States. One critical, but often under-represented aspect of this process is the transition of research and development efforts into viable comme rcial products that can be rapidly and effectively distributed to military, government and civilian users. An essential element to any government operation that develops new intellectual properties is technology transfer. It's about basic research, di agnostic development, testing and valid ation. It's about developing advanced counter-measures and tr aining for biological events, and it's about being prepared. The biological threat grows w ith each scientific advancement. The good guys aren't the only ones who are capable of doing this research. The enemy is well-educated, they are resourceful, and they are focused on us. 3.16 Recreation A few comments were made regarding recreatio n, and those submitted included concerns about impacts to a proposed trail netw ork and the State Botanical Ga rden of Georgia. General recreational impacts were also noted. One comm entor noted available recreational opportunities as a positive statement on the qua lity of life in the area. The EIS will include a section on recreation. It will identify existing recreation opportunities at each alternative site , including those brought up during pub lic scoping. It will also address potential impacts to recreation opportunities from construction and operation of the proposed facility. Additional information on recreation ca n be found in the EIS in the Socioeconomics section, which will address quality of life at each alternative site. February 2008 3-20 NBAF Scoping Report ..we are concerned that the citing of the facility in this location will disrupt our Greenway Network Plan. Our current plans call for trails at this site along the Middle Oconee River and a trail linking it to trails along the North Oconee River The proposed site abuts the State Botani cal Garden of Georgia (SBGG, a STATE institution). This site is vi sited by thousands of citizens every year. It encompasses 313 acres and borders the Middle Oconee River. Mo re than five miles of nature trails traverse the site...It is probable that the prox imity of the NBAF would discourage visitors and decrease the number of contributing membe rs - hence the loss of operating funds to keep the garden in the condition that the citizens of Georgia expect and deserve. building the NBAF at the location proposed would compromise the integrity for recreation and wildlife habitat so me of UGA's most scenic lands. And we choose to play here because you wi ll not find a better s pot in the State of Mississippi for outdoor recreations, whether you enjoy riding your four wheelers on the weekends, or you enjoy riding horses, which is my passion, or if you enjoy, you know, hunting or fishing. 3.17 Regulatory Compliance Comments related to regulatory compliance fell into two main categories: Category 1 : Issues related to NEPA a nd the NEPA process specifically. Category 2 : Issues related to laws and regulations regarding the project other than NEPA. Most of the NEPA-related comments had to do with the scoping process and/or the scoping meetings themselves. Some were complimentar y of the process and me etings, others were negative, with specific complaints about the process and/or meetings. Regulatory comments outside of NEPA included questions about C ongressional approval of the NBAF project and compliance with international treaties. Others suggested the establishment of a citizens' advisory board. Comments concerning the scoping process and/or the scoping m eetings were reviewed by the public participation team and suggestions for impr oving the future meetings were identified. The EIS will address regulatory requirements at the fe deral, state, and local levels for the proposed project in Chapter 4. Additiona lly, Chapter 1 will cover backgr ound information on international treaty obligations and co ngressional authorizations related to the NBAF. Category 1: We do not believe the community has had a fair say in deciding to host the facility. I thoroughly enjoyed the excellent scoping meeting that you organized at Kansas State University. I was hoping to speak at th e gathering but after nearly two hours of overwhelmingly positive comments by individuals who had regi stered to speak ahe ad of time...it become obvious I would not get my say. This was a highly scripted publ ic meeting more than HEAVILY weighed in favor of those seeking to have Manhattan as the chosen site. February 2008 3-21 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments The meeting in Flora was a dog and pony show for the damn politicians. If you want to know the truth, send out ques tionnaires to the people within 50 miles of here and a letter telling them the truth about this facility, and what it will research. I do not appreciate the way these community meeting have been conducted with all the political grand standing and th e smoke screens about how wonde rful it will be to have some of the most dangerous diseases know n to man right here in our front yards. this is one of the best presentations I have seen in terms of explaining how the environmental process proceeds. I just want to tip my hat to that. ... I already voiced my disappoint ment to some personnel here, with the way that this was advertised. ... I don't feel that there was adequate direct notification by the people or the persons who were responsible for advertising the hearing. I think it's really important that there be direct notification to the supervisors, police de partment and planning department about meetings of this sort to afford them the time to sit and gather their thoughts...I think - just as cour tesy for the future and for th e community, I suggest that you do that. The politicians knew ahead of time that you were coming, but put nothing in the paper until a week prior to the scoping meeting. I must object to the manner in which the September 18, 2007 scoping meeting was conducted. Those who wished to comment were required to sign in. No advance sign-in mechanism was posted on the DHS website. No r did the public notice published in the federal register identify any mechanism for advance sign-up for commentary. The federal register notice stated that sign -up sheets would be made avail able at 6 p.m. on the date of the scoping meeting. NEPA provides no basis for selective hearing of those with comments - yet several dozen politicians and lobbyists supporting the proposal were called first, indeed, were called in decreasing order of political precedence with senators speaking first. This was not the order in which speakers signed up on the sign-in sheet. ... Such a practice wholly frustrated the purpos e and spirit of the National Environmental Policy Act. Indeed, the vast bulk of the comments by those politicians and lobbyists who spoke fell outside the scope of the meeti ng's statutory purpose: identification and proposal of issues to be addressed in the forthcoming EIS. Those conducting the meeting made no effort whatsoever to limit or channel comments to ensure compliance with NEPA. First, let me say that I attended the Bio-Agro Scoping Meet ing held Tuesday, Sept, 18th at South Granville High School. I went to th e meeting thinking that you were coming to hear the publics comments (the people who live here) about the new facility. I was totally wrong! The meeting was a well orchestrated, pr e-arranged political, business (businesses mostly not from this area), government official s, etc. - representatives with more concern about money than the well-being (health) of those who live here. In my opinion, this area is too greatly populated to put this facility. Since the lab is proposed for Butner, an incorp orated town since last July, I could not understand why the organizers of this meeting came to Creedmoor to have the meeting. What's wrong with having our meeting in Butn er? Is there a -- has Homeland Security -- are they following proper protocol. ...DHS must conduct a full assessment of the impacts of a possible terrorist attack on a biological weapons facility. Two recent cour t decisions, one on a nuclear power plant and the other on a BSL-3 laboratory, require such a thoroughgoing analysis. In the most recent case, Tri-Valley CARES v. Departmen t of Energy, citizens living near the February 2008 3-22 NBAF Scoping Report Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory filed suit calling for the incl usion of terrorism in the environmental assessment of a laboratory similar to the proposed NBAF. ...we all here in the San Antonio community realize that the environmental impact statement is a very important step in ensuring the public has confidence in the suitability of building and operating a complex science campus like the NBAF. Category 2: The U.S. Congress has not approved the NBAF. In order for it to be built a federal law that has protected the U.S. mainland for 60 years would have to be repealed. How many people know that the building of NBAF has not been approved by Congress? The bill to establish NBAF is still up for debate, as no ted in the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Congress will hold hearings, as several members are concerned about whether there's enough oversi ght for the biolab building boom that's taking place. ...lack of local contro l: the fact that the Department of Homeland Security would have sole jurisdiction over the facility excludes the very local people whom it would affect most from having any voice in issues that arise from its development -- this is a recipe for future development problems. I recognize that landowners cannot legally dict ate the final design, however a forum that provides me and other citizens the opportunity to share our thoughts and concerns in the process will ultimately benefi t the community as a whole. I understand that by statute, Plum Island must be considered as the location of the new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, a Bi o-Safety Level 4[sic] facility which is needed to meet the needs of Homel and Security Presidential Directive 9. Compliance with international law and treaty obligations must be addressed in the EIS. At issue are potential violations of the Biologica l Weapons Convention. The aerosolization of microbes and toxins is how biological weapons are created. So, too, is genetic modification of existing strains. Bo th of these techniques are proposed for the NBAF. The development of biological weapons is flatly prohibited by the Biological Weapons Convention, a treaty ratified by 144 nations including the United States. 3.18 Socioeconomics A large number of comments were submitted con cerning socioeconomics. This broad category included comments concerning community impacts a nd impacts to other social structures, jobs, demographics, taxes and other revenue, schools and other community facilities, and economic impacts from a release of a pathogen. Comments were both positive and negative. The EIS will address socioeconomics, includin g the various topics brought up during public scoping, such as employment and income, population and housing, and quality of life (which includes education and community services). Additiona lly, in response to public comments, a specific analysis of the agricu lture and hunting industries at each proposed site will be conducted, as well as an economic analysis of a pathogen release. This community has diligently worked to posi tion itself for a project of this caliber. Significant job creation is needed to meet the demands of the intellectual capacity... February 2008 3-23 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments Graduating from our area schools, these bright and creative minds are hungry for opportunities to make a significant and lasting impact. Two years ago, the citizens of this county decided they would not be satisfied, nor would they tolerate a 20.3 percent poverty rate or median income of its citizens of roughly $17,000 dollars per year, and they developed a strate gy to improve the quality of life of its citizens. Keep to our strategies of increasing the participation economy and dramatically improving our educational oppor tunities... no other community in America has come together just this way. The loca tion of the National Bio[and] Agro-Defense Facility will not only bring as many as 500 direct jobs, but it would also result in the creation of other jobs in the community and would have a positive impact on healthcare and housing in this community. It would also, in my opinion, have a pos itive direct effect on increasing that median income fo r the citizens of this community. ...just to talk about the cost, as in the monetary cost, to ou r community, they make it very clear on the site that a minimum of 30 acres will become a part of this facility, that there would be - that there would need to be, at no cost, new facility provisions and upgrades provided and new roadways, all of these thin gs to be provided by the consortium, the state government, the local government, private entities. So be sure and keep an eye on your tax dollars that way. Having NBAF in Athens will help our area grow and will ensure have a vibrant business environment. And finally, I'm interested to know when ther e's all this talk of new jobs what guarantees do we have that these good and the high-payi ng jobs won't go to people from Plum Island, to transfer down here and the Athens citizens will be left with security and custodial work. It seems to me that the community memb ers of Athens and their needs are often overlooked for the political and financial gain of a few. This project promises to give benefits to a few, while endangering and threat ening the quality of life of the many. We do not believe a facility of this kind is in the best long-term interests of the community. I would hope that you do not confuse CHEER LEADING from local stakeholders with COMMUNITY ACCEPTANCE. Should the state's cattle industry, for example, go under due to disease, the potential impact on earnings alone would be nearly 1.4 billion, not to mention the roughly $312 million paid to the state's coffers in taxes. Nearly 20 percent of Kansans are employed in agriculture. Animal and plant agriculture in Kansas are economically inseparable. This facility is important to our national defense and would help the Kansas economy by attracting new jobs to our stat e. Kansas farmers would bene fit from the research that would take place at the NBAF. My husband and myself background cattle and farm in Kansas and we know how tenuous the market is when even a threat of ag related disease is talked about. The NBAF project is expected to create 1,500 jobs and bring $3.5 billion to the state over the next 20 years. The NBAF will attract more businesses and create more opportunities for research by attracting private biotechnology companies and a professional workforce. We farmers will benefit from th is research and economic growth and that's why we support bringing the NBAF to Kansas. February 2008 3-24 NBAF Scoping Report ... Mississippi leads the nation in poverty. We 're the poorest state in the country. And looking at all these other sites that you're showing up here, th ere's no other state that this will have the impact as it will in Mississippi and for this region. I know the quality of life is an issue for th e people who will be work ing at the facility, schools, opportunities for s hopping, and that short of thing. We are a school district of approximately 11,000 students. We are the second fastest growing school district in th e State Mississippi. We grow by roughly 500 students a year. Since the year 2000 we have grown from 10 ca mpuses to 21 campuses. Our parents have supported us to the tune of $142,000,000 in construction, two bond issues that have passed over whelming. Our composite ACT sc ore is 23, which is two points above the national average. NBAF and its supporting businesses are bound to enhance the ad valorem tax structure of this area, which can only be good for all of us. I represent a lot of people. I represent the poor, the elderly and the mentally and physically challenged. I also represent the people who are having a hard time. They may be working and at some point in time they lose their job, so I also represent them. So I'm probably an official that has the widest variety of people and I'm not even elected. And I take my job very seriously. Many have spoken about the great benefit that NBAF has, and it's really undeniably -- I mean, it's vast. It's just there are going to be a lot of things that NBAF can bring to this community. I am a beef cattle producer and know th e importance of this to our economy. We would also like addressed the economic impacts both of the complete abandonment of the island, which is a possibi lity that's been raised time and time again, and of the economic impacts of an investment in the island that you mentioned to a Bio 4, and particularly the economic impacts to local municipalities like mi ne that would have probably a huge burden in term s of the security issues. As you are aware, foot-and-mouth is highl y contagious in livestock and could prove devastating to our economy if it were to spread. In fact, the disease is so contagious that the law states that work on it must be done on an island. Recently, England has had a possible foot-and-mouth outbrea k which many are tracing to the Pirbright vaccine facility. Many in England fear this outbr eak could prove as devastating as 2001 foot- and-mouth outbreak which resulted in approxim ately 7 million cattle being slaughtered and devastation to England's agriculture and tourism industries. I also know that it would re duce the value of our land a nd its functions as a farm considerably. Local farmers are already having financial problems. If a problem DID occur, it could devastate the local chicken, pork and cattle farmers. The Granville area is growing rapidly, and that would put a halt to the growth that county needs. We've helped to prepare a skilled biotechno logy work force through grants, programs, teacher training and curriculum development partnership... And tomorrow, North Carolina State University and the State will dedicate the world's largest center for training bio-manufacturing workers, evidence of investment of almost a hundred million dollars in public and privat e investment to support the work of about a dozen partners toward the development of a bio-manufacturi ng work force in North Carolina. The February 2008 3-25 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments Biotechnology center will help NBAF... to be integrated into North Carolina's business, scientific and education communities. The area, if selected, is too populated with institutions, hospitals , prisons and individuals that live close by or in the area. We do not need this so-called economic advantages that would be produced by such a potentially devastating operation. I hope the general population is not naive enou gh to think there will be jobs for locals after the facility is built. ...[NBAF] will decrease the quality of life for every one in our community . It will also decrease the value of our homes. We believe San Antonio has emerged as a top finalist because of its vast research capacity, diverse and well-educated work for ce, excellent transportation infrastructure, strong community acceptance and already ex isting, nationally recognized biodefense research facilitie s and expertise. What we offer in those two areas of research collaborations, resear ch partnerships, joint academic appointments with NBAF scientists , joint research seminar programs educational programs, training opportunities for NBAF employees, and internships, new courses, and of course, a pipe line of work force for highly skilled Ph.D.s and post docs. We train students, including we have a mast er's degree in biotechnology with an emphasis on biodefense. Our student body population can provide the highly trained workforce that's necessary to run the NBAF, and we can, also, as a university, provide the teaching and training opportunities for NBAF scientists and the employees, including continuing education opportuni ties. We also have various opportunities to create new degrees at the university as well. San Antonio is a wonderful city to live in... It has a very un ique cultural diversity here. We have a very low cost of li ving. It's a military-friendly ci ty, and it's very supportive of the bioscience industry. 3.19 Traffic and Transportation Issues related to traffic and transportation were expressed by commentors from all sites. In some cases, commentors were touting th eir existing transportation system, including roads, airports, and other transportation infrastructure, as adequa te to meet the needs for the NBAF. Others expressed concerns about increased traffic due to construction and operati on of the facility and the associated impacts. Still other commento rs expressed concerns about the safety of transporting pathogens or noted that evacuation routes need to be considered in case of an accidental release of pathogens from the facility. The EIS will include a section on traffic a nd transportation. It will identify existing transportation infrastructure and address potential impacts to traffic and transportation during both construction and operation at each alternativ e location, should the proposed NBAF be built. Highway 316 (to I-85 to Atlanta) is called one of the most dangerous roads in Georgia. It is an amalgam of congestion, speeding, and danger ous intersections. Since It is the most common route to Atlanta from Athens, ... How will DHS address the hazards inherent February 2008 3-26 NBAF Scoping Report intransporting deadly pathogens along such a stretch of highway clearly and in enough detail to satisfy the parents of UGA students? I am wondering if the NBAF will, with people tr aveling to and from, require lots and lots of flights and maybe require the enlargem ent and extension of runways at Ben Epps Airport, which is a hot topic in the community right now. I think the transit is a problem for having dangerous material coming back and forth from 316, basically which is already dangerous. These people that bring them (pathogens) to the facility back and fo rth, you know, is it going to be in an armored guard car? Is it just going to be somebody in a Volkswagon driving down the road, you know -- so, I mean, how are they going to transport these things back and forth? You know, it's just -- I don't think it's that safe. Not only is Kansas centrally locate d with convenient transportation... Although Manhattan is situated close to the ge ographic center of the United States, it is not an adequate transportation hub for distribution or for a faci lity of the magnitude of NABF. Manhattan has no major transportation or shipping company. It has no major railroad or freight distribution facility. It is not on any major hi ghway or inter-state system. There are no major north/south traffic corridors to take goods in and out of Manhattan to other parts of the country. It s regional airport can only provide service for small to moderate size airplane. The city does not have a public transportation system . The commercial facility, Jackson Evers Internatio nal Airport, is located just northeast of the crossroads in Mississippi where I-55 and 20 cross. We have eight commercial airlines representing non-stop service to...All of those major mar kets, you know, have international service. So understandably our infrastructure , your travel arrangements and your ability to move large items of commerce, as well as your animal, you know, all of your animals we can accommodate. What changes or enhancements to roads will be necessary to handle the increased traffic? Once again, to reiterate the fact that we have no evacuation plan for the north fork, for the east end, pretty much for Long Island. We were subjected recently to some flooding where our major artery, the Long Island Expressway, was closed down, and a lot of people were affected by that. A lot of people were affected by that. That's something else to keep in mind. I think it should take a very close and reasoned look at the transportation problem that affects the town, particularly on State Route 25 in the vicinity of the labs facility in Orient. It's a well-known fact that biological material is tran sported to the site by truck in preparation for shipping to the island via the facility's ferry boat. The security ramifications of this form of transport must be look at in the context of the continued increase in road and boat traffi c associated with the population growth the east end... I believe that North Carolina and Creedmoor is the best location in the United States for this facility because of the following reas ons:...Infrastructure and proximity to freeways, rail and international airports... We believe San Antonio has emerged as a fina list because of its vast research capacity, diverse and well-educated work force, excellent transportation infrastructure... The existing Research Park road system incl udes a looping road system comprised of secondary arterials with a 22,000 vehicle per day capacity. In addition, the Research February 2008 3-27 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments Park is located at the intersection of two state designated highways, FM 1957 and Highway 211. Bexar County has submitted and the Texas Department of Transportation is reviewing a financing proposal to provide 6- to 8 million in improvements to both of these state facilities. Will biological samples be transported over th e mainland? Will germ samples continue to be entrusted to the U.S. Postal Servic e, airport limousines, and private shipping companies like FedEx...with drivers unaware of the packages' contents without training on how to handle an accidental spill? In the 1990s, our own Southwest Research Institute used UPS to transport a dangerous simian virus. The virus packet fell out of the truck and lay along the side of Loop 410 for about 24 hours. C an you also do better than the private couriers formerly employed by the USDA? If the lab is located in San Antonio, will the DHS virus shipments arrive by armed escorts on our local roads? Will notification of each trip be given to emergency responders, such as fire and police departments, along with the nature of the samp les and what to do in case of an accident, including a fatal one? What will our res ponse time be for samples that go astray? 3.20 Waste Management Issues related to waste were a commonly e xpressed concern. The issues ranged from questioning proposed waste management practices fo r the facility to haza rdous wastes (including past hazardous waste issues) to impacts of waste from the facility. Of particular concern was animal waste and how it would be handled. The EIS will include a section detailing how wastes from the facility will be handled. Existing infrastructure for waste disposal at each alte rnative site will be identified, along with any upgrades that may be necessary to handle wastes from the NBAF should it be located at that site. Methods for destroying pathogens will be described. Different disposal methods for animal carcasses under considerati on will also be explained. With the EIS, I would like to k now if our local landfill will be utilized in any way to dispose of waste from this facility? The area is very ecologically vulnerabl e and currently suffering from overpopulation stresses, including a severe water shortage and grossly overburdened sewage processing facilities. We are concerned about potential discharge of animal waste pollutants and how animal wastes will be treated and dis posed of. We are also concerne d about the disposal of other wastes, especially hazardous wastes, on site and the potential for contamination of surrounding areas, communities, the river, and downstream communities. The city has ... analyzed the dumping issues. They analyzed how to handle waste and have figured out ways to resolve the probl ems, I also request the EIS address the estimated quantities of ...sanitary waste produ ced by the facility and any post facility treatment requirements t hat may be necessary. A valid concern was expressed over the dispos al of carcasses and waste materials. Can you explain in detail how that would be handled and why it is safe? Without specifics, it sounds like whitewashing. In particular, can you protect against infectious material February 2008 3-28 NBAF Scoping Report getting into the ground water or above ground water sources, and if so, how? Again, please be specific. This particular point coul d affect far more than just Granville County. Generically speaking, how would disposal of hazardous materi al operate outside of the BSL 4 or effect a community? What engineering controls will be in place to address contaminated waste treatment and disposal of experiment al animal or plant remains? (e.g. pr etreatment, incine rator, etc.). Will there be solid or liquid waste streams leaving the facility? If so, what level of pretreatment will be provided, and will the Town of Butner WWTP be required to provide additional treatment? Will there be a dedicated water treatment plant and waste treatment facility on site? I'm a citizen of the local area, North Carolina. I am wondering if you build a plant, or build a facility in Granville County, how you are going to dispose of the hazardous waste that's going to be created by your work? ... You will have hazardous waste from the medical work in the form of plastics and dead animals and whatever else. Are you going to have an onsite incinerator or are you going to take the waste somewhere else? If you have an onsite incinerator are you aware that th ere's a lot of people that live in Granville County? That may not be a high density lik e Raleigh or Durham, but there are people who live around there, and I'm just concerned that the hazardous waste incineration will create air pollution. The Research Park has participated in the c onstruction of outfall sewers, with a capacity of 5 million gallons per day for the park. Waste water disposal is being expanded for th is facility, and which we think should be considered as part of your assessment for the site. Will DHS, as the USDA did, ignore OSHA's and EPA's lengthy list of workplace safety violations, including repeat infractions? Problems on Plum Island include massive landfills and bunkers filled with rusting metal drums filled with toxic materials; inoperative wastewater treatment, effluent, and storm drains; incinerator problems; sewage spills - in short, multiple problem s with the Clean Water Act and environmental laws prohibiting the storage of hazardous materials. The proposed site is a SuperFund site that was never cleaned up with remains of hand grenades and live ammunition shells and ot her left other things from WWII. 3.21 Water Resources Concerns were expressed about water resources, particularly from those areas currently experiencing drought. Water av ailability, quantities needed by the facility, and conservation measures were of great concern. People also expr essed water quality concerns. Others noted the availability of their water resources. Public concerns about water resources will be addressed in the EIS in a section devoted to water issues. This section will describe the existing water resources at each of the proposed alternative locations and then describe how the proposed f acility would impact water quality and quantity during both construction and operation. February 2008 3-29 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments I would ask that you closely examine wate r reuse and appropriate water conservation measures for this facility dur ing your environmental analysis. We're concerned about the consumptive use of this site, particularly in drought. We're also concerned about the impervious area of this site. It's a massive site, a lot of impervious area that's going to change the hydrology right close to the river. Impervious area causes higher highs and lowe r lows in your flows, and we be lieve that at that site in the river, we can't afford any lower lows. ...but let's be specific about water with the dwindling resource. What do we decide? Do we put it in our homes when we really get down to very little water or do we safeguard a facility like this? You know, let's get down to specifics. Maybe I should ask that you have a plan when we have -- if we have no water. Let's be specific about that. We urge DHS to minimize the volume of stor mwater runoff leaving the site by using low impact development techniques such as a vegetated roof (which not only retains stormwater but also may reduce heating and cooling costs), porous pavement for the parking areas, and the use of bioretention area s to infiltrate runof f, with a goal of achieving the same runoff volume fo r the site as currently exists. We urge DHS to make every effort to minimize water use, especially consumptive use, in the operation of the site. Athens, GA is in the (illegible) year of a major level 4 drought. We are currently unable to draw water from the Middle Oconee & Oc onee rivers. Our only source, the Bear Creek Reservoir only has 6 weeks of water supply at this time. I am concerned that this project will require use of lots of water that we frankly c an't spare. Use of valuable water & avail of water need to be seriously considered before this project is considered for bldg in Athens, GA. The location of NBAF in Athens would mean an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of these (water/water treatment/sewer) resources. Athens is experiencing an officially labeled \"exceptional\" drought - Level 4 water restrictions (all outdoor watering is BANNED). This is our second serious long-term drought - each over two years in duration this decade. It is a ve ry visible problem that citizens will not forget. Drought is the top story in the newspaper, on the radio, and on the web. The Athens-Clarke County Manager told the ACC Commissioners that if it ha sn't rained by early November they will need \"to actually allocate wa ter to some users and restrict it to others.\" By that time, ACC Public Utilities Director said that reservoir water would be severely reduced, and the \"treatability\" of the remaining water ma y affect its taste and color...What are DHS' contingency plans for NBAF during future water shortages ? I'm against it because of the huge water use. We are extremely concerned that it would be built so close to the Oconee River, the health of which is very important to us. 100,000 gallons of water per DAY!\"...We are currently in the middle of the biggest drought of this century. It has been stated that we are in a near \"crisis\" situation. This alone is a large enough reason to not build the fa cility here. Increased restrictions are a regular occurrence in the summer months. Unless a permanent solution to Athens' recurring wate r shortages is implemented, the proposed NBAF laboratory will produce a negative impac t on the community and our lifestyle by depleting an insufficient supply of a critical natural resource. February 2008 3-30 NBAF Scoping Report I also request the EIS address the estimated quantities of water needed for the program -- operation of the facility and any water quality parameters required. And that was one of the things I looked at in terms of the plans that were submitted for this facility. And I'll just say now, I didn't s ee an air or a water problem that would be a threat to the county. We are currently in the worst drought in history, and those resources are being mis- managed with no back up plans. The Tar River flows through our farm and the proposed site is quite close to the Tar River which has a number of endangered species. It is also close to Falls lake and Lake Mickie which are water supp lies for Raleigh and Durham. The site is also near the water supplie s for 2 major cities and the Tar River, Dangerously diseased animals should be co ntained in an environment far away from residential areas, water supplies, institutions housing disadvantaged people, or prison populations. The water here is already in bad condition...so why make it worse. If it is possible for it (deadly dixons) get into our waterways I wouldn't want me or my animals to have it in my water. You MUST take into consideration in any environm ental impact statement...our dwindling water supply brought on by recurrin g drought and the impact of contamination of the watershed by such a facility as N BAF along with the impact on the drinking water for Raleigh and other nearby Triangle areas. The Research Park has participated in the c onstruction of outfall sewers, with a capacity of 5 million gallons per day for the park. Water service is provided by Bexar Metropolitan Water District . Since 1990 there has been a powerful water system available to the Research Park. Currently, Bexar Met has a 2 million gallon ground storage tank under construction at the research park, along with a 1 million gallon ground storage and 2 1/2 million gallon elevated storage tank under construction at the Stevens Ranch facility, located immediately north of Potranco Road. Both of those facilities will provide water service to the Research Park. These facilities have the 10,000 gallon per minute high servic e pump capacity and almost 8,000 gallons per minute of well capacity. The storage will be enough for over 15,000 equivalent connections. We have the water plan that goes out 50 years with growth included for residential, commercial, and, of course, for milita ry necessity and federal necessity. 3.22 Comments Outside the Scope of this EIS A few comment submissions received by DHS were outside the scope of this EIS and will not be considered as part of the range of issues and alternatives evalua ted in the NBAF EIS. They did not help to identify potential significant en vironmental impacts. These comments were submitted by members of the public seeking employment at NBAF. February 2008 3-31 Section 3.0, Summary of Scoping Comments (This page is intentionally left blank.) February 2008 3-32 NBAF Scoping Report 4.0 C ONCLUSION This report summarizes what DHS heard from the public in rega rd to the proposed NBAF during the public scoping period. The next step in the NEPA process is development of the EIS, which is currently underway. All public comments received during scoping are helping to shape the scope of the NBAF EIS and define the issues that will be analyzed in depth in the EIS. Public comments have facilitated the identification and unde rstanding of local issues. For example, in Georgia, public comments identified a propose d trail system that might not have been known from existing maps and background informati on. Public comments also helped identify potentially affected institutionali zed populations near some of the alternative sites, and identified the need for inclusion of explan atory background information in Ch apter 1, Purpose and Need, to address public comments. Additionally, ongoing local issues were unders cored by a large public response. For example, many commentors in Georgia and North Carolina mentioned their current regional drought and expressed concerns a bout the water resources that the NBAF would require. Members of the multi-disciplinary team preparing the EIS received all the public scoping comments applicable to their technical sections, and will consider or address the comments in their respective sections as appl icable. In this way, the comments received by DHS are used to guide the development and preparat ion of the draft NBAF EIS. The next opportunity for the public to comment on the NBAF will be spring 2008, when the draft NBAF EIS is expected to be available.

NBAF SCOPING REPORT APPENDIX C SCOPING MEETING FORMS U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Scoping Meeting Objectives and Agenda SCOPING MEETING OBJECTIVES The objectives of the National Bio and Agro-Defense F acility Environmental Impact Statement (NBAF EIS) scoping meeting are to: inform stakeholders about the proposed action to build the NBAF, and solicit relevant, focused, input from stakeholders on the scope of the NBAF EIS. SCOPING PROCESS The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is sponsoring public scoping meetings and encouraging meaningful public involvement in the vicinity of sites identified for proposed construction and operation of the NBAF. The department will also conduct a regional meeti ng in Washington, D.C. Participants will have the opportunity to meet officials from the DHS Office of National Laboratories, which is tasked with preparing the EIS, as well as officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service-Veterinary Services (APHIS-VS) and Agricu ltural Research Service (ARS), which are working cooperatively with DHS in setting priorities regarding diseases that would be researched in the NBAF. The purpose of the meetings is to collect input from the pub lic on the NBAF EIS alternatives and issues. At the same time, the meetings provide a better understanding among members of the public concerning the proposed action and a better understanding th e federal agencies involved. A court reporter will transcribe comments provided durin g the formal comment period. Comments obtained at these scoping meetings, as well as oral and written comments obtained from other communication mechanisms, will be given equal consideration in defining the scope of the NBAF EIS.

There are three general types available (Class I, II, III). Properly maintained Class I and II BSCs, when used in conjunction with good microbiological techniques, provide an effective containment system for safe manipulation of moderate and high-risk microorganisms (biosafety level 2 and 3 microorganisms ). Class II BSCs also protect the research material itself through high-efficiency particulate air filtration (HEPA filtration) of the air flow down across the work surface. Class III cabinets offer the maximum protection to laboratory personnel because all hazardous materials are contained in a totally enclosed cabinet. Biosafety Levels (BSLs): There are four levels of biosafety used to designate and regulate lab work with microorganisms. The range is BSL-1 in which the microorganisms are not known to cause disease in healthy adult human beings to BSL-4 in which the microorganisms pose a risk of life-threatening disease and for which there is no known vaccine or therapy. BSL-3Ag refers to research involving large agricultural animals. There are guidelines in place to ensure safe work sites through a combination of engineering controls, management policies, work practices, and procedures. Increasing levels of personnel and environmental protection are provided for by the different biosafety levels used in microbiological/biomedical laboratories. The higher the level of the biosafety lab, the more stringent the level of protection. Countermeasures: A collective term used in biocontainment laboratories to include vaccines, biotherapeutics, diagnostic assays, therapies, and vector control. Diagnostic Assay: A test to determine presence or absence of infectious agents or antibodies to determine if an animal has or has been exposed to an agent. Environmental Impact Statement: A document required of federal agencies by the National Environmental Policy Act for major federal actions that may significantly affect the quality of the environment. A tool for decisionmaking, it describes, analyzes, and compares the potential environmental impacts of the alternatives to accomplish the purpose and need to which the agency is responding. Glovebox: A sealed container designed to allow a trained scientist to manipulate microorganisms while being in a different containment level than that of the agent they are manipulating. Built into the sides of the glovebox are two glove ports arranged in such a way that one can place their hands into the ports, into gloves and perform tasks inside the box without breaking the seal. There are three general types available (Class I, II, III) based on the material the box and gloves are made of. High-Consequence Foreign Animal Diseases (FADs): Diseases not present in the United States that are capable of rapidly spreading and causing high numbers of deaths and/or devastating economic consequences (e.g., foot and mouth disease). Homeland Security Presidential Directives 9 and 10: These directives established a national goal to protect agricultural infrastructure to ensure our livestock and food safety and security. Host: In biology, a host is an organism that harbors a virus or parasite, typically providing nourishment and shelter. National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF): Proposed facility that would address both current and future requirements in research, diagnostics, and training for combating high-consequence agricultural threats. Research would focus on early development and discovery of vaccines and diagnostic tests for these important agricultural diseases. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA): Requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for major federal actions that may significantly affect the quality of the environment. In NEPA, the term \"environment\" encompasses the natural and physical environment (i.e., air, water, geography, and geology), as well as the relationship of people with that environment (i.e., health and safety, socioeconomic conditions, cultural resources, noise, and aesthetics). Natural Reservoir: Refers to the long-term host of the pathogen of an infectious disease. It is often the case that hosts do not get severely ill. Pathogen or Infectious Agent: A biological agent that causes disease or illness to its host. The term is most often used for agents that disrupt the normal physiology of an animal or person. Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC): U.S. laboratory for the diagnosis, research, and training for foreign animal diseases. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory is located at PIADC. This laboratory has the capability of diagnosing over 30 foreign animal diseases and is responsible for educating veterinarians in the recognition and diagnosis of these diseases. The USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) operates a program focused on basic discovery and research of foreign animal diseases. The DHS scientific program focuses primarily on the advanced development of vaccines and other countermeasures. Wildlife Reservoir: Wildlife, normally defined as wild, free-roaming animals (e.g., mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians), therefore, this refers to a wild animal as long-term host of the pathogen of an infectious disease. It is often the case that hosts do not get the disease carried by the pathogen or it does not show symptoms of the disease and is non-lethal. Zoonotic: A term for diseases transmitted by animals to humans. Definiciones de T\u00e9rminos T\u00e9cnicos Biological Safety seguridad biol\u00f3gica).

Each level is designed to prevent lab-acquired infec tions and to protect the environment from potentially hazardous agents. The higher the level of the biosafety lab, the more st ringent the level of protection required to work in these areas. BSL-1: Microorganisms not known to cause disease in healthy adult human beings. Potential hazards to laboratory personnel and the environment are minimal. Work is conducted on open be nch tops using standard microbiological practices (lab coats, safety glasses and gloves). Lab personnel have specific training in the procedures conducted in the lab and are supervised by a scientist with general training in microbiology or a related science. BSL-1 labs are located in high school and college-level biology and chemistry classrooms and research institutions. BSL-2: Microorganisms of moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment. Lab personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic agents and are supervised by scientists competent in handling infectious agents and associated procedures. Access to the lab is limited wh en work is being conducted. All procedures in which infectious aerosols or splashes may be created are conducted in biological safety cabinets or other physical containment equipment. BSL-2 labs are located in research institutions, essen tially all hospitals, and medical and veterinary schools. An example of a microorganism that would be studied in a NBAF BSL-2 lab is the inactivated virus that causes foot and mouth disease. BSL-3: Microorganisms present in the United St ates, and foreign and em erging agents that may cause serious consequences in livestock but are not harmful to human beings because of available protective measures. Lab personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic microbes potentially lethal to animals and are supervised by trained scientists who are experi enced in working with these agents and associated procedures. Access to the lab is controlled (i.e., card reader for entry; self-sealing, double door access, etc.) All procedures involving the manipulation of infectio us materials are conducted within biological safety cabinets or other physical containment devices, or by personnel wearing appropr iate personal protective clothing and equipment. BSL-3 labs have special engineering and design features to enhance safety. BSL-3 labs are located in research institutions, hospitals, and medical and veterinary schools. An example of a microorganism that would be studied in a NBAF BSL-3 lab is the live virus that causes foot and mouth disease in cloven-hoofed animals. BSL-4: Microorganisms that pose a high risk of life-threatening disease and for which there is no known vaccine or therapy. Lab personnel have specific and thorough training in handling extremely hazardous infectious agents and fully understand all containment functions, practices, equipment and lab design characteristics. Lab personnel are supervised by trained scientis ts who are experienced in working with the microorganisms and with associated procedures. Access to the lab is strictly controlled. The facility is in a controlled area within a building, which is completely isolated from all other areas. There are four BSL-4 facilities currently operating in the United States in populated urban areas: Atlanta, Georgia; Fort Detrick, Maryland; Galveston, Texas; and San Antonio, Texas. There has never been a public exposure at a BSL-4 lab in the United States. Examples of microorganisms that could possibly be studied in a NBAF BSL-4 lab include Nipah and Hendra viruses, both of which are emerging zoonotic diseases that can spread from their natural reservoir to human beings, and are often fatal.

Flora Industrial Park Site Flora, Mississippi CONSORTIUM The Gulf States Bio and Agro-Defense Consortium is a coalition of public and private entities working collectively to attract the National Bio and Agro-Defen se Facility (NBAF) to Mississippi. The Consortium is comprised of the State of Mississippi, the University of Mississippi (UM), the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), Mississippi State University (MSU), Jackson State University (JSU), Tulane University, the Tulane National Primate Research Center, the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), Tougaloo College, and Battelle Memori al Institute. Except for UTMB, a ll members of the Consortium are within a two-hour drive of the proposed site. The C onsortium has committed to providing regular shuttle services to and from the NBAF for all university participants. PROPOSED NBAF SITE LOCATION The proposed site is located in the Flora Industria l Park in Madison County, Mississippi. A mixed-use commercial park, the Flora site offers a gentle rolling terrain with nearby access to interstates, railways, and the Jackson-Evers International Airport. The Madison County Economic Development Agency maintains the park's more than 150 acres. The portion under consideration for the NBAF currently has no tenants or physical structures and is approximately 150 acres. The only te nant in the Flora Industrial Park is Primus, a manufacturing company. COMPLEMENTARY RESEAR CH AND WORKFORCE The Consortium partners bring a diverse set of capabi lities and significant biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) and BSL-4 experience to NBAF operations. MSU has a veterinary school, maintains significant research programs in animal sciences, and operates a BSL-3 facility on its main campus. MSU also operates the state diagnostic veterinary laboratory in Pearl, Mississippi, a 40,000 square foot facility that will have an active BSL-3 within two years. The university also has collaborations with th e U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Services (ARS), a facility that has the distinction of possessing the greatest number of agricultural doctorate degrees in the nation. The UM has a world renowned progr am in pharmaceutical sciences that would be crucial to NBAF's countermeasure development and licensing activities. The National Center for Natural Products located at UM currently screens more than 30,000 samples and houses more than 18,000 natural products with proven medicinal/agricultural properties. UMMC and Tulane University have programs in medical research and in clinical trial development and execution. Currently, UMMC has over 350,000 square feet of researc h space, with an additiona l 178,000 square feet of new construction to be completed with in two years. UMMC researchers have recently been recognized at the national level for research involving anthrax and potential treatments. Both institutions have infectious diseases doctoral and medical training and operate BSL-3 facilities certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Federal Drug Administration. TNPRC has a free-standing 3,000-square foot facility dedicated to BSL-3 animal research. UTMB has an established research program in infectious diseases directly relevant to bioterrorism and operates one of the few BSL-4 fac ilities in the nation. Battelle has a long history of successfully managing national laboratories, includi ng West Jefferson BSL-3 laboratory, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center. Battelle is responsible for the operation of over 50,000 square feet of res earch facilities with research and development totaling over $4 billion. JSU has a National Center for Environmen tal Health and the National Center for Biodefense Communications. The Consortium also provides a strong workforce for the NBAF in Mississippi. JSU and Tougaloo College are Historically Black Colleges and Universities that produ ce significant numbers of African-Americans in the sciences. Collectively, the Consortium graduates a pproximately 40 doctorate-, 100 masters- and 370 MISSISSIPPI SITE ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION baccalaureate-level students in relevant life sciences each y ear (average over the past five years). Their fields of study include biology, chemistry, biochemistry, an imal sciences and physiology, bioengineering, and pharmaceutical sciences. Annually, approximately 100 medi cal doctors, 50 doctors of veterinary medicine, and 75 professional pharmacists graduate from the Consortiu m academic partners. Currently, approximately 60 percent of bachelor-level and above-degree professi onals leave the area because life sciences opportunities cluster elsewhere in the nation. AVAILABLE SITE INFRASTRUCTURE The proposed site is adjacent to U.S. Route 49, a majo r four-lane divided highway. It is connected via major highways Interstate 55 (approximately 17 miles), which supports north/south interstate traffic, and to Interstate 20 (approximately 20 miles), which sup ports east/west interstate traffic. The State of Mississippi will commit to providing any needed utility improvements for the NBAF . The utilities for the site are supplied by Entergy Corporation, which has a three-phase power onsite. Natura l gas is available onsite (6-inch main). Water is supplied by the Town of Flora. Currently, the site is supplied by a 10-inch pipe adjacent to the site, with 100,000- and 200,000-gallon storage tanks located within 0. 75 miles. Sewer services (treatment plant) are also provided by the Town of Flora; there is currently an 8-inch main adjacent to the site. Manhattan Campus Site Manhattan, Kansas CONSORTIUM The Heartland Bio Agro Consortium (HBAC) is led by Kansas State University and the Midwest Research Institute, with the Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute providing the cohesive leadership that unites the diverse membership. HBAC partners include a number of research universities within the Kansas, Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska region, and several research uni versities outside the region chosen to complement strategic research foci. HBAC partners include privat e research institutes and research hospitals. The greater Kansas City area is a major hub of the veterinary pharmaceutical industry, having companies in the vaccine development, production, and distribution arenas. HBAC partners include a number of these organizations. PROPOSED NBAF SITE LOCATION The proposed site for locating the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) is on the Manhattan, Kansas, campus of Kansas State University, immediately adjacent to the Biosecurity Research Institute (BRI). The BRI is a $54 million research/education facility having biosafety level (BSL-3E), and BSL-3 Agriculture (BSL-3Ag) state-of-the-art research space. The site borders on the research laboratories and teaching hospital of the Kansas State University College of Veterinary Medicine. Adjacent land is available for pasturing animals. The Kansas legislature has passed a bill authorizing the transfer of all or part of a tract of land located in township ten (10) south, range eight (8) east of the sixth (6th) Principal Meridian in Riley County, Kansas. The total acreage is just less than 45 acres when the land containing the BRI is subtracted. COMPLEMENTARY RESEAR CH AND WORKFORCE HBAC is a unique combination of research universiti es, research institutes and hospitals, subject-matter experts, and leading firms in the bioscience industry - all capable of providing a collaborative, enriched, and valuable environment for the NBAF. A spectrum of activ ities comprises the lifecycle of bioscience/biomedical innovation, including basic research, discovery, valid ation, Good Labor Practices (GLP) manufacturing, government regulatory issues, clinical trials, in-hospi tal diagnostic support, and de fined outcomes. HBAC and the Kansas City region have adopted a one-medicine/one-health approach which links the animal health and the human health communities in a joint search for answers to intriguing h ealth and bioscience questions. This approach is particularly relevant to biodefense and emerging infectious disease research for several important KANSAS SITE ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION reasons. First, many of the emerging diseases are zoonotic in nature, and these diseases pose real threats not only in the food animal and wildlife arenas, but on the human health side as well. Second, solutions to the problems in both animal health and human health re quire a fundamental understanding of the same basic principles of disease physiology and require the same tools and technology to bring the solutions from concepts to reality. HBAC is in a region rich in animal infectious disease research, pharmaceutical production, and workforce availability. The Kansas City bioscience industry is an in ternationally-recognized lead er in the animal health arena. Its strength is in its numbers: the region is hom e to 165 life science companies, with 37 focused on protecting and securing animal health. Within the $14.5 billio n animal health industry, more than 40 percent of the U.S. sales and 26 percent of worldwide sales are t hose of companies having a presence in the Kansas City area. There is a major focus on research and de velopment, GLP/Good Manuf acturing Practices(GMP) manufacturing, and translation into the marketplace. Mo re than 5,000 animal health workers provide a uniquely skilled workforce. AVAILABLE SITE INFRASTRUCTURE Utilities available to the site include water, electricity, sewer, telecommunications, and natural gas. The site is within 1,000 feet of a fire station and within 1 mile of a hospital having emergency room service. Adjacent to the site is the Kansas State University Research Park, allowing co-location of industrial research facilities as the NBAF matures. The Biosecurity Research Institute and th e College of Veterinary Medicine ensure a critical neighboring mass of infectious disease research. Texas Research Park Site San Antonio, Texas CONSORTIUM The Texas Biological and Agro-Defense Consortium (TBAC) is a collection of stakeholders formed to bring the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) to San Antonio. Members of the TBAC include the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research (SFBR), the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Ant onio (UTHSCSA), Brooks Development Authority (BDA), and the Texas Research & Technology Foundation (TRTF). SFBR is a leading independent biomedical research institution, home to the Southwest National Primate Research Cen ter, which includes the capacity for non-human primate studies in biosafety level 4 (BSL-4), and a veterinary technical staff experienced in the ma nagement and use of nonhuman primates ranging from chimpanzees to marmosets. UTSA has created several research centers and institu tes which have formed collaborative programs with institutions and private research entities. A number of research programs are focused on parasitic and fungal disease, biotechnology problems of national strategic need, including detection and analysis of influenza, genomic sequencing of biothreat agents and novel vaccine development. UTHSCSA is home to numerous research programs fo cused on established a nd emerging infectious diseases caused by parasitic, fungal, viral, and bacterial pat hogens. A significant number of these programs in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology focus on pot ential bioterror threats related to the NBAF mission. TRTF owns operates the 1,236-acre Texas Park (TRP). TRTF is a 501(c)(3) non-profit innovation-based economic developer for San Antonio and South Texas. PROPOSED NBAF SITE LOCATION The San Antonio site alternative is located on 100 acres within the TRP, Bexar and Medina Counties. The TRP site is part of a former working ra nch that was donated to TRTF in 1986. The TRP is approximately four miles west of the City of San Antonio; it is in its extra-territo rial jurisdiction, and it is a Designated Industrial District of the City. COMPLEMENTARY RESEAR CH AND WORKFORCE San Antonio is home to a comprehensive research community with ongoing research programs related to the NBAF mission. The bioscience and healthcare industry sector is the largest economic generator in the community. The TRP site is within proximity of skilled research and technical staff with expertise in design, construction, and operations conducte d at biological and agricultural research facilities. AVAILABLE SITE INFRASTRUCTURE Available site utilities are adjacent to the TRP site w ith capacities that meet or exceed NBAF requirements. Facilities to increase water capacity ar e currently under construction, as is a 200-megawatt electrical substation in the TRP. Natural gas capacity is more than adequate for the NBAF and future resident tenant needs. Existing wastewater lines are adequate, and planned upgrades w ould service the NBAF and future tenant needs. Transportation arteries are adjacent and nearby the TR P and the alternative site. The TRP fronts on State Highway 211 (Texas Research Parkway). To the south, State Highway 211 connects to U.S. Highway 90 approximately two miles from the TRP. To the north , State Highway 211 insects with State Highway 1957 TEXAS SITE ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION (Potranco Road) and will be extended nor thward within four years to connect to the northwest segment of State Highway 211.

Umstead Research Farm Site Butner, North Carolina CONSORTIUM The North Carolina Consortium for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) is a statewide public- private partnership. Academic members include two la nd-grant agriculture universities, a veterinary college, three medical institutions (two with public health components), and the North Carolina (NC) Community College Bionetwork. Government participants include federal, state and local officials, in addition to the North Carolina Departments of Agriculture, Health, Commerce, Environment, and Crime Control. Agriculture is represented by our major livestock associations (beef, dair y, poultry, and swine), the NC Farm Bureau, and the NC Agribusiness Council. Biotechnology is represented by non-profit groups promoting biotechnology statewide, and by private sector members in biologi cal research and development, vaccine manufacturing, diagnostics, and similar fields. PROPOSED NBAF SITE LOCATION The proposed site comprises 195 acres in the Granville County portion of the 4,035-acre NC Department of Agriculture Umstead Research Farm (URF). The parcel is unimproved land that was partially logged in 2000. There is a 54-acre area on the northeast side available for expansion, although there are other expansion options available within the farm. URF neighbors include the NC Department of Health and Human Services, a National Guard facility, NC State University, and federal, county, and state entities. Four large universities, the Research Triangle Park, the Eastern Regional Offices of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service-Veterinary Services (APHIS-VS), and state agencies, are within a 25- to 45-minute drive. The site's proximity to nationally ranked research universities, the Triangle area's private sector, our agriculture resources, and government facilities, offers opportunities for synergies, communications, collaborations, and efficiencies that make it highly attractive. COMPLEMENTARY RESEARCH AND WORKFORCE The Triangle region, and the state, have garnered multiple awards and continuous r ecognition for its depth in science and engineering. This strength is generated by its research universities and community college training programs, and is enhanced by its extensive science a nd technology-based private sector, supported by science- and engineering-friendly communities. The Research Tria ngle region of North Carolina, within which the URF is centrally located, is a national resource in health, engineering, general science, and technology research. In the past few years, North Carolina ranked 7th and 15 th nationally for total National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation research funding. The Consortium also excels at moving research into the NORTH CAROLINA SITE ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION marketplace as evidenced by having two partner instituti ons (NC State University and UNC-Chapel Hill) in the Milken Institute's September 2006 top 25 U.S. Universities for Technology Transfer a nd Commercialization. Resources are plentiful. Based on a quick survey, it is estim ated that in the Research Triangle Park and immediate vicinity, private sector companies with at l east 20-percent research laboratory space have nearly 8.6 million square feet of research laboratory space dedicated to addressing NBAF relevant issues. Note this does not include the large federal (U.S. Environmental Prot ection Agency and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences), state (NC Agriculture, Environment, and Public Health), or university facilities. The availability of highly trained workers extends acro ss NBAF workforce needs, starting with construction and design workforce availability. From 2003 to 2006, the Research Triangle Regional Partnership projected a Triangle area three-year track of $800 million in bi otechnology construction projects employing over 15,000 workers. North Carolina has approximately 30 architect ure/engineering companies, and as many contractor companies, with a total of more than 1,500 employees w ith expertise in laboratory planning. At least five national architecture/engineering firms with experien ce in high biocontainment facilities have offices and employees in the area, with yet another moving to the Triangle this year. The workforce availability also includes those in the technical life science disciplines. Nearly half of North Carolina's 48,000 bioscience- related business employees work in the Triangle area. Approximately 10,000 employees work for pharmaceutical companies statewide carrying out aseptic manuf acturing operations at the highest standards. The workforce pipeline in North Carolin a is also formidable. Central to this is the NC Community College System's (NCCCS) BioNetwork, a statewide program o ffering training from short courses and certificates through associate degree programs in biomanufacturing, bi otechnology, and facility validation for life science technical, design, and construction workers. Statewide, during past three years nearly 2,850 students were enrolled in NCCCS biotechnology programs. For the acad emic year ending in 2005 , over 1,200 more enrolled in relevant continuing education courses. In addition, the University of North Carolina system provides advanced training and facilities in these areas throughout the state. During the 2005-2006 academic year, NC institutions conferred nearly 8,000 bachelor's and graduate degrees in NBAF relevant areas. AVAILABLE SITE INFRASTRUCTURE A major interstate highway (Interstate 85) is within three miles of the site, and connects with Interstates 40 and 95. Service spurs for the Norfolk-Southern Railroad exis t in Butner, approximately three miles south. The Raleigh-Durham International airport is less than 25 mil es away, and the Piedmont-Triad International airport is just over an hour drive from the proposed site. Public safety is managed by the NC Department of Crime Control & Public Safety, which offers the formidable resources of state-level security and protection to the NBAF site. Power is supplied by Duke Energy Corp oration (als o supplies power to the Research Triangle Park), and would be able to provide any load demand to the NBAF. Natural gas is supplied by Public Service Company of North Carolina, a regulated public utility serving ov er 400,000 customers thro ughout a 28-county area. Telephone and telecommunications is supplied locally by the t own of Butner and/or the NC Department of Health and Human Services. Business telephone service is offered by Sprint/Embarq, and multiple cellular companies cover the area. Telecommunications availability includes the T1 service at the John Umstead Hospital in Butner, as well as regular commercial services vi a several private companies. Water and sewer service is supplied by the South Granville Water and Sewer Authority. It has an operating water and sewer capaci ty of three million gallons per day (MGD) and five MGD, respectively, and is operating at approximately 50 percent capacity. Power, water, and co mmunications are currently su pplied throughout and around the URF, allowing several options for br inging service to the proposed site. South Milledge Avenue Site Athens, Georgia CONSORTIUM The Georgia Consortium for Health and Agro-Security is headed by Governor Sonny Perdue, a veterinarian who appreciates the threats to Georgia's citizenry and economy posed by zoonotic diseases, along with Senators Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson. The consortium includes our Congressional delegation, Department of Economic Development, the Board of Re gents and Chancellor of the University System of Georgia (USG), the state's research universities and Ge orgia Research Alliance (GRA); Mayor Heidi Davison and other state and regional government leaders and ag encies; Georgia Department of Agriculture and a coalition of Georgia's agricultural associations and stak eholder groups formed to attract the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF); Georgia Power, Merial and other companies; private/non-profit biomedical and health agencies; local and state economic development foundations and chambers of commerce; Georgia's Department of Technical and Adult Education (DTAE) and Athens Technical College; the Office of Homeland Security/Georgia Emergency Management Agency; local health officials, including the CEOs of Athens Regional and St. Mary's hospitals. The University of Georgia (UGA) has provided leadership and will have close ties to the NBAF and serve as its local host. PROPOSED NBAF SITE LOCATION The proposed site is a 67-acre parcel owned by UGA lo cated southwest of the intersection of South Milledge Avenue and Whitehall Road in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia. It is located behind the UGA Livestock Instructional Arena and is used as horse pasture. Th e site, currently known as a portion of Tax Map Parcel No. 18-3-010, is surrounded by a large tract of UGA propert y. There are no adjacent neighborhoods. The title to the property is vested in the USG Board of Regents, which will deed the property to the federal government if the site is selected for construction of the NBAF. COMPLEMENTARY RESEAR CH AND WORKFORCE UGA excels in research relevant to the NBAF, with pr ominent programs in livestock and wildlife health and disease surveillance, global emerging infectious diseases, microbiological food safety and agro-security. UGA has new initiatives in public health, and with the Me dical College of Georgia is planning a new Athens' medical campus to open in 2009. It has made major inv estments in relevant research infrastructure, including the Paul Coverdell Biomedical and Health Sciences Cent er and the Animal Health Research Center, and has a history of productive interactions with university, federa l and industrial partners. Al so in Athens, Merial - a world-leading producer of animal health care products - has expertise in vaccine production that would greatly assist the NBAF, and the U.S. Department of Agri culture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Southeast Poultry Research Lab is a principal repository of national expertise in avian influenza. A major pharmaceutical company is considering Athens as one of two sites for construction of a major pandemic vaccine production facility, which would doveta il perfectly with the mission of the NBAF. The Athens site would locate the NBAF an hour away from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the world's health sentinel, which responds to emerging infectious diseases and thus would naturally interact with the NBAF. Also in Atlanta, Emory's School of Medicine and School of Public Health are world class and offer vaccine and infectious disease research programs that are among the nation's best. Additionally, Georgia Tech is increasing its biomedical programs and offers state-of-the-art engineering solutions to diagnostic and therapeutic problems, and Georgia State has a National Resource Center for Viral Immunology. Collectively, these Athens-Atlanta asset s offer the NBAF the best potential to respond to natural pandemic or bioterror threats in a robust, well-coordinated fashion. Other features distinguish the research environment offered by an Athens location. Building on strengths identified by outside consultants, the Georgia Re search Alliance recently received the first $10 million GEORGIA SITE ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION installment on a major, multi-year state investment in vaccine and anti-viral research infrastructure. The Georgia life science industry is booming and now ranks 7th in the United States for number of companies. And, Georgia has invested statewide in specialized containment facilities for infectious disease research - from biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities at the CDC and Georgi a State in Atlanta to the BSL-3-Ag facilities at the USDA, and the near-completed UGA Animal Health Research Center in Athens. Thus, Georgia has ample high-containment design, building and operations expertise, and it also offers relatively low building costs in a national comparison. Athens provides an attractive location in which to recr uit scientific staff, and the state provides a robust and customizable pipeline for workforce recruitment and training. The USG graduates over 7,000 bio-/health science majors per year and Georgia offers state-of-the -art programs for tailored workforce recruitment. DTAE and Athens Technical College, in particular, provide a range of biotechnology workforce training, and DTAE's nationally recognized Quickstart program allow for custom ization of workforce training to meet specific NBAF needs. This commitment and array of unique programs ensures the availab ility of a well-trained and sustainable NBAF workforce. AVAILABLE SITE INFRASTRUCTURE Athens-Clarke County (ACC) has ample water and sewer capacity to serve the NBAF. ACC can withdraw 35 million gallons per day (MGD) from Bear Creek reservoir and another 28 MGD from the North and Middle Oconee Rivers. The ACC water treatment facility can treat 28 MGD but will be upgraded and expanded to 32 MGD by 2008. ACC's existing peak-day water demand is 26 MGD. An 8-inch water line is accessible on South Milledge Avenue, but will be upgraded to a 12-inch line to better serve the NBAF . There are no sewer lines close to the proposed site, hence a force main will be installed along South Milledge Avenue and waste pumped via an onsite lift station to the ACC's Middle Oconee Wastewater Treatment Facility (about threee miles away). Currently, the facility has a capacity of 6 MGD with an existing demand of 3.5 MGD. The facility will be upgraded and expanded to 10 MGD by 2012. Georgia Powe r will provide electrical service from two separate substations through existing electrical distribution infrastructure, mitigating transient power loss. The site is located 1.5 miles from the Athens Perimeter (Loop 10), a four-lane bypass that quickly connects to Atlanta and Hartsfield Jackson International Airport via Georgia Route 316, or to Interstate 20 or 85 via U.S. Route 441.

NBAF SCOPING REPORT APPENDIX E SCOPING MEETING POSTERS U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY NOTE: The posters have been scaled to print on standard-size (8\u00bd x 11) paper, making some of the text illegible when printed. National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility Environmental Impact Statement (NBAF EIS) Science and Technology What Is an Environmental Impact Statement? An environmental impact statement (EIS) is a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) document that analyzes the environmental impacts that could result from implementation of a proposed action and alternatives. Why Is an EIS Being Prepared? NEPA requires federal agencies to conduct an EIS for major federal actions that could have signicant impacts on the environment. Under NEPA, \"environment\" includes the natural and physical environment (such as air, water, geography , geology), as well as people's relationship with the environment (such as health, safety , jobs, schools, housing, and aesthetics). An EIS looks at both short-term and long-term effects and considers possible mitigation measures, if applicable. The EIS Process An EIS is prepared in a series of steps: gathering government and public comments to dene the issues that should be analyzed in the EIS (known as \"scoping\"); You preparing the draft EIS; receiving and responding to public comments on the Are draft EIS; and preparing the nal EIS. Decisions are not made in an EIS; rather, the The EIS Process Record of DecisionFinal EISPublic Comment on Draft EIS*Draft EISScoping Period*Notice of Intent for EIS * Opportunities for public participation, including public meetings Here EIS analysis is one of several factors decisionmakers consider. The decisions are announced in the Record of Decision (ROD) after the nal EIS has been published. Scoping (Public Input) A federal agency begins the scoping period for an EIS by publishing a Notice of Intent (NOI) in the Federal Register to let the public know that it is considering an action and will prepare an EIS. The NOI describes the proposed action and may provide background information on issues and potential impacts. During the scoping period, the public can provide comments on the proposed action, alternatives, issues, and potential environmental impacts to be analyzed in the EIS. Scoping may involve public meetings and other means to obtain public comments on the EIS. The NOI for the NBAF EIS was published on July 31, 2007. Draft EIS (Public Input) Preparation of the draft EIS is the next step in the process. The draft EIS presents, analyzes, and compares the potential environmental impacts for the proposed action and alternatives and their implementation, and provides additional information on the methodologies and assumptions used for the analyses. The draft EIS is made available for public review and comment. Public comments on the draft EIS are considered in the preparation of the nal EIS. The draft NBAF EIS is scheduled for spring 2008. Final EIS Following the public comment period on the draft EIS, a nal EIS is prepared and distributed. Responses to public comments are included in this document. Record of Decision (ROD) After the nal EIS is published, a minimum 30-day waiting period is required before a ROD can be issued. The ROD noties the public of the decisions made on the proposed action and the reasons for those decisions. The decisionmaking process may include consideration of factors such as cost, technical feasibility , agency statutory missions, and national objectives, as well as the potential environmental impacts of an action. No action can be taken until the decision has been made public and the ROD is published in the Federal Register. G07-0104 National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility Environmental Impact Statement (NBAF EIS) Science and Technology Biocontainment Laboratories and Facilities Biosafety Levels (BSL) There are four levels of biosafety used to designate and regulate lab work with microorganisms. Each level is designed to prevent lab-acquired infections and to protect the environment from potentially hazardous agents. The higher the level of the biosafety lab, the more stringent the level of protection required to work in these areas. Research in BSL-2, BSL-3 and BSL-3Ag Laboratories Biosafety Level Agents Practices Safety Equipment Facilities Locations BSL-1 These agents are not generally associated with disease in healthy people Good microbiological practice Hand washing No eating, drinking or gum chewing in the lab Pipeting devices and lab coats High school and college-level biology and chemistry classrooms and labs Research institutions BSL-2 NBAF would study animal diseases and the agents that cause them These agents are associated with human disease (i.e., research done at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) BL-1 practices plus: Limited lab access Most work may be performed on a bench top Biohazard warning signs \"Sharps\" precautions Biosafety manual dening any needed waste decontamination or medical surveillance policies Class I or II Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs) or other physical containment devices Lab coats, gloves, face protection, as needed Open bench-top Sink for hand washing is required Autoclave available Medical and veterinary schools Research institutions Essentially all hospitals BSL-3 NBAF would study animal diseases and the agents that cause them These agents: are associated with human disease and cause illness by spreading through the air (aerosol) (i.e., research done at the CDC/National Institutes of Health [NIH]) cause diseases that may have serious or lethal consequences BSL-2 practices plus: Controlled access Decontamination of all waste Decontamination of lab clothing before laundering Class I or II Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs) or other physical containment devices Protective lab clothing, gloves, respiratory protection as needed BSL-2 plus: Physical separation from access corridors Self-closing, double-door access Exhaust air is not recirculated Negative airflow into lab Design includes back-up/redundant systems Medical and veterinary schools Research institutions Essentially all hospitals BSL-4 NBAF would study animal diseases and the agents that cause them These agents: are associated with human disease and cause illness by spreading through the air (aerosol) or have unknown cause of transmission (i.e., research done at the CDC/NIH) cause diseases that are usually life- threatening BSL-3 practices plus: Clothing change before entering Shower on exit All material decontaminated on exit from facility All procedures conducted in Class III BSCs, or Class I or II BSCs in combination with full- body, air-supplied, positive-pressure personnel suit BSL-3 plus: Separate building or isolated zone Dedicated supply and exhaust, vacuum, and decontamination systems Design includes back-up/redundant systems Other requirements outlined in NIH/CDC publication \"Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories\" Currently, there are four BSL-4 facilities operating in the United States in populated urban areas: - Atlanta, Georgia - Fort Detrick, Maryland - Galveston, Texas - San Antonio, Texas Source: Modied from the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 5th Edition; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, February 2007, U.S. Government Printing Of ce, Washington, DC. BSL-4 Laboratory and Animal Suites Approximately 10 percent of the NBAF would be designed for BSL-4 research G07-0104 National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility Environmental Impact Statement (NBAF EIS) Science and Technology National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility Mission The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service-Veterinary Services (APHIS-VS), and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) are expanding their missions to ensure protection of the nation's livestock and, thereby , public health. Goal The proposed National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) would meet the requirements identied in Homeland Security Presidential Directives 9 and10 and would provide an integrated facility for studying foreign animal and zoonotic diseases (transmitted from animals to human beings). Design The NBAF would provide a safe and secure facility in which basic research, diagnostic development and validation, diagnostic testing, advanced countermeasure development, and training for high-consequence livestock diseases can occur. Approximately 10 percent of the 520,000 square foot NBAF would be designed for biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) research.This would allow directed research on diseases not previously well characterized. The NBAF would: Research high-consequence biological threats involving foreign animal and zoonotic diseases. The new and unique government biocontainment infrastructure would: integrate those aspects of public and animal health research that have been determined to be central to national security; assess and research evolving bioterrorism threats over the next ve decades; and enable DHS and USDA to fulll their integrated homeland defense research, development, testing, and evaluation responsibilities. The NBAF would: Serve as a unique BSL-3 and BSL-4 livestock laboratory capable of developing countermeasures for foreign animal and zoonotic diseases. Provide advanced test and evaluation capability for threat detection, vulnerability , diagnostics, and countermeasure assessment for agricultural and zoonotic diseases. Support licensing of vaccines and other countermeasures developed jointly by ARS and DHS. Research DHS and USDA have identied the following diseases that would potentially be studied at the NBAF. This list may change based upon continued evaluation of risks to the U.S. agriculture system. Foot and Mouth Disease Diseases Studied in BSL-4 Facilities Classical Swine Fever Nipah Virus African Swine Fever Hendra Virus Rift Valley Fever Japanese Encephalitis Virus Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia Research Focus Research performed at the NBAF would include basic discovery and countermeasure development, advanced countermeasure development (in collaboration with industry), and diagnostic assay development and validation. In some cases, researchers would study a disease to determine: the mechanism it uses to enter animals, the type cell the disease affects, and the effects the disease causes on the cell; how to develop countermeasures to help animals develop protection against the disease, and how quickly animals can become protected from the disease after they are vaccinated. G07-0104 National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility Environmental Impact Statement (NBAF EIS) Science and Technology Site Selection Process In a joint activity with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) developed the requirements for a next-generation biological and agricultural defense facility to enhance and protect the nation's agriculture and public health. The work planned for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) would address biological and agricultural national security risks by co-locating scientists from several federal agencies in a state-of-the-art biocontainment facility . DHS held a competitive process by soliciting Expressions of Interest (EOI) to select a potential site for the NBAF. A multi-agency (DHS, USDA, HHS and the Department of Defense), multi-disciplinary (engineers, scientists, lawyers, academics and communicators) team was formed to review submissions. EOI was published January 19, 2006, in the Federal Register. 29 EOI submissions were received recommending potential sites for the NBAF. EOI submissions were evaluated against four criteria: - proximity to research capabilities, - proximity to workforce, - acquisition/construction/operations, and - community acceptance. Evaluation resulted in 18 potential sites in 11 states announced in August 2006. Additional information was requested before DHS conducted sites visits in April and May 2007. CA April April 30 April - 3 May 7-11 May 16 May University of California/LLNL Georgia Consortium for Health and Agro-Security (2 sites) Heartland BioAgro Consortium (Kansas) (2 sites) Kentucky and Tennessee NBAF Consortium (Kentucky) Mid-Atlantic Bio-Ag Defense Consortium (Maryland) Gulf States Bio and Agro-Defense Consortium (Mississippi) (3 sites, withdrawing one before the site visit) University of Missouri at Columbia NBAF Consortium North Carolina Consortium for the NBAF Oklahoma State University Consortium Texas A&M University and the NBAF Consortium Brooks Development Authority and Brooks City-Base Foundation (Texas) Texas Research and Technology Foundation (San Antonio NBAF Consortium) Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research (San Antonio NBAF Consortium) Wisconsin Consortium (University of Wisconsin-Madison site at the Kegonsa Research Facility The nal site alternatives selected for evaluation in the NBAF Environmental Impact Statement are: - South Milledge Avenue Site; Athens, Georgia - Manhattan Campus Site; Manhattan, Kansas - Flora Industrial Park Site; Flora, Mississippi - Plum Island Site; Plum Island, New York - Umstead Research Farm Site; Butner, North Carolina -Texas Research Park Site; San Antonio,Texas G07-0104 National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility Environmental Impact Statement (NBAF EIS) Science and Technology NBAF EIS Alternative Sites The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has identied six reasonable alternative sites to evaluate in the environmental impact statement (EIS) for the construction and operation of the proposed National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF): South Milledge Avenue Site; Athens, Georgia This alternative would locate the NBAF on the campus of the University of Georgia Whitehall Farm. Manhattan Campus Site; Manhattan, Kansas This alternative would locate the NBAF within the Kansas City Animal Health Corridor on the Kansas State University Campus. Flora Industrial Park Site; Flora, Mississippi This alternative would locate the NBAF in the Flora Industrial Park in Madison County , Mississippi. Plum Island Site; Plum Island, New York This alternative would locate the NBAF on the same federally owned property as the existing Plum Island Animal Disease Facility (PIADC) off the northeastern tip of Long Island.
