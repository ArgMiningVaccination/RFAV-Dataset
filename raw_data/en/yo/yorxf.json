The NC Department of Health and Human Services is part of the Climate change Interagency Council.

Without significant investment, these facilities cannot be retro-fitted or updated to achieve major energy efficiencies. However, efficiencies can be accomplished by reducing the footprint and reducing underutilized space, which in turn will result in an overall energy consumption reduction. DHHS, in conjunction with the Facility Maintenance Directors, will perform an analysis of state-owned DHHS facilities to determine opportunities for consolidating underutilized buildings. These facilities are to assign an Energy Manager to assist the Agency Energy Manager. Among the DHHS Facilities projects with high potential energy savings are: a. Tune-up boilers b. Ensure proper operation of steam traps c. Identify and repair utility leaks d. Verify proper settings of HVAC equipment and outdoor air dampers Other potential energy saving projects include: a. Replace fluorescent lighting with LED lighting b. Implement temperature setbacks in non-patient areas c. Replace equipment motors with premium efficiency motors Procurement Post Green Purchase Product Criteria for incorporation into future contracts for public comments for the products such as the ones listed below: |Product||Preferred Features| |Cleaner||Non-toxic | Low-VOC Bio-based Green seal of approval |Paper Towels||Recycled content | Green Seal of Approval |Plastic Trash Can Liner||Recycled content | Green Seal of Approval |Upholstery/Rug Cleaner||Green Seal "}
