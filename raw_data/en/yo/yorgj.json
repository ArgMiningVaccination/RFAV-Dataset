Accreditation of an institution of higher education by NWCCU indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality evaluated through a peer review process. An accredited college or university is one that has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities is not partial, but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution. Inquiries regarding an institution's accredited status by NWCCU should be directed to the administrative staff of the institution.

Schleich, PhD President of NUNM Greetings from the Office of the President Letter from the President | n unm.edu 2 NUNM is proud of its longstanding legacy of academic excellence. Founded in 1956, NUNM is the oldest accredited naturopathic medical school in North America and the home of natural medicine. NUNM's reputation for healthcare innovation and leadership grows with each new generation of practitioners and healthcare professionals who help change the course of health care in the U.S. through their research, exemplary patient care and publications. Our remarkable graduates are our legacy. We invite you to join us\u2014discover the exciting opportunities that await you. NUNM offers medical education programming in naturopathic and classical Chinese medicine, and in related health sciences disciplines. This includes 11 exceptional accredited degree programs\u2014eight postgraduate degrees and three undergraduate degrees. NUNM is recognized as the international leader in the training of naturopathic primary care physicians and Chinese medicine practitioners. While many of our graduates go on to clinical practice, they're also researchers, professors, public health educators, and political activists bringing natural medicine to the forefront of the national healthcare system. Students from all corners of the world come to NUNM for the opportunity to work with our accomplished and renowned faculty. Our exceptional curricula offer medical students a rich combination of classroom study, hands-on research and patient care. In addition to the campus Lair Hill Health Center\u2014the largest natural medicine clinic in the region\u2014and our Beaverton Health Center, the university has access to a dozen local community clinics offering unique and diverse clinical experiences to students.

Breadth and Diversity of Programs NUNM is also known for its exceptional curricula in a variety of other areas.

We have developed our programs knowing that your education will be reinforced through the application of hands-on, interactive learning, from the classroom to the clinic, to fieldwork in a country thousands of miles from campus. Whether you're developing a research study and interviewing focus group participants, or developing whole-food recipes in NUNM's professional teaching kitchen, our students learn through their direct experiences.Natural Medicine Today Health awareness is making giant strides\u2014and interest in healthy lifestyles and natural medicine is rising significantly. Studies have shown that Americans are seeking more natural health products and services than ever before. Natural medicine provides patients a wide variety of beneficial treatment options unavailable to them through conventional medicine. Recognizing this, Western medical doctors at hospitals, medical clinics and research centers are opening more doors to naturopathic and Chinese medical practitioners. It is truly an exciting period of change in health care as natural medicine becomes more integrated into the traditional health services delivery system. It is a rapidly growing and evolving field that is serving the escalating need for preventive health care for millions of Americans. Natural medicine is known by many names: alternative medicine, integrative medicine, complementary medicine and others. One reason for its many labels is that natural medicine includes a variety of healing modalities. Your education at NUNM may include some or all of the following therapeutic methods, depending on your course of study. Traditional medical systems, such as naturopathic medicine, Chinese medicine, homeopathy and acupuncture Mind-body medicine Physical medicine, including hydrotherapy and naturopathic manipulation Botanical medicine and herbal supplements Nutrition counseling Conventional therapies, including pharmaceuticals and minor surgery Mental health counseling Each of these modalities present a tool for the physician to gain a better understanding of the patient, leading to health diagnosis and treatment for conditions ranging from minor ailments to chronic and acute care. When these modalities are used in conjunction with conventional medicine, they have been called \"complementary\" medicine. When used as a substitute for conventional medicine, the same modalities have been called \"alternative\" medicine. When a conventional physician and a naturopathic physician work together to create the best healing plan for the patient, it's increasingly referred to as \"integrative\" medicine. As more people seek combination treatments, future natural medicine practitioners and physicians will need to be knowledgeable about both conventional and natural medicine. Our graduates are able to bridge this gap.NUNM\u2014The Home of Natural Medicine 2018-2019 Course Catalog | T he Home of Natural Medicine 3 Academic Calendar 2018-2019 Summer quarter begins (clinic) July 2, 2018 July 4 holiday (campus & clinics closed) July 4, 2018 Summer academic classes begin July 9, 2018 New student institutional orientation (students attend one date) Aug. 22, Sept. 5, and Sept.12, 2018 Summer academic classes end Aug. 31, 2018 Labor Day holiday (campus & clinics closed) Sept. 3, 2018 New student academic orientation Sept. 13, 2018 Summer quarter ends Sept. 15, 2018 Fall quarter begins Sept. 17, 2018 Last day to add or change sections Sept. 28, 2018 Last day to pay tuition & fees Sept. 28, 2018 Late payment fee assessed Oct. 1, 2018 Last day to drop classes Oct. 5, 2018 OSCE 1 exam Oct. 19, 2018 Veterans Day (campus & clinics closed) Nov. 12, 2018 Clinic holiday I - Thanksgiving week session Nov. 19-21, 2018 Thanksgiving break (no academic classes) Nov. 19-24, 2018 Thanksgiving holiday (campus & clinics closed) Nov. 22-24, 2018 Make up for Veterans Day Dec. 5, 2018 Finals week Dec. 10-14, 2018 Fall quarter ends Dec. 15, 2018 Winter break (no academic classes)Dec. 16, 2018- Jan. 6, 2019 Clinic holiday II - Prewinter session Dec. 17-22, 2018 Winter break (campus closed) Dec. 24-30, 2018 New Year's Day (campus & clinics closed) Jan. 1, 2019 Clinic holiday III - Post-winter session Jan. 2-5, 2019 Academic Calendar | nunm.edu 4 Academic Calendar 2018-2019 Winter quarter begins Jan. 7, 2019 Last day to add or change sections Jan. 18, 2019 Last day to pay tuition & fees Jan. 18, 2019 Martin Luther King Day (campus & clinics closed) Jan. 21, 2019 Late payment fee assessed Jan. 22, 2019 OSCE 3 exam Feb. 1, 2019 Last day to drop classes Feb. 1, 2019 OSCE 2 exam March 15, 2019 Make up for Martin Luther King Day March 18, 2019 Finals week March 25-29, 2019 Winter quarter ends March 30, 2019 Spring break (no academic classes)March 31 April 7, 2019 Clinic holiday IV - Spring break session April 1-6, 2019 Spring quarter begins April 8, 2019 Last day to add or change sections April 19, 2019 Last day to pay tuition & fees April 19, 2019 Late payment fee assessed April 22, 2019 OSCE 1 exam May 3, 2019 University Council May 3, 2019 Last day to drop classes May 3, 2019 Memorial Day (campus & clinics closed) May 27, 2019 Make up for Memorial Day June 17, 2019 Finals week June 24-28, 2019 Spring quarter ends June 29, 2019 Commencement June 29, 2019 2018-2019 Course Catalog | A cademic Calendar 5 Undergraduate Programs NUNM offers three Bachelor of Science degrees: Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health Sciences (BSiHS), Bachelor of Science in Nutrition (BScN), and Bachelor of Science in Integrative Therapeutics: Massage Therapy (BSiT-MT).

Applications for transfer credit must be accompanied by a letter from the applicant's previous program dean stating that the applicant is in good academic and behavioral standing at the time of application. 9. Credits will be evaluated preliminarily for transfer before an offer of admission is made. The applicant will receive a copy of the formal transfer credit evaluation with a list of courses that must be taken at NUNM and a tentative class schedule for their first term, if they are admitted. Students will sign a letter agreeing to the final list of approved transfer credits. 10. Any veteran receiving GI Bill\u00ae benefits while attending NUNM is required to obtain transcripts from all previously attended schools and submit them to the VA School Official (located in the Registrar's Office) for review of prior credit. Second professional degree candidates, defined as a healthcare practitioner with a doctoral or master's level degree, may apply for fall or winter admission to the MSOM or DSOM programs. Depending upon prior completed coursework, a full-time schedule may not be available for one of these terms of entry. A proposed class schedule for the intended term of entry and a degree completion plan can only be created after a candidate's prior coursework has been evaluated. P lease note that there is a $75 nonrefundable transcript evaluation fee. Admissions | nunm.edu 10 The following are transfer policies specific to each NUNM college and school beyond those in the general transfer policy section above. Transfer Credit Specific to the College of Naturopathic Medicine Transfer credit will be considered for applicants to the ND program who are eligible to sit for a first professional medical licensing examination in the United States. Transfer credit will be allowed for first-year and some second-year ND courses. Credit for clinical experiences or clinical education at another school is not transferable. NUNM has a requirement that all ND students complete 16 elective credits, in addition to the required core curriculum, in order to encourage students to take additional coursework in areas of special interest and round out their education at NUNM. Transfer students may be allowed transfer credit for some of their noncore coursework if completed in a doctoral program at a regionally accredited institution. This determination will be made by the ND program dean or designee. Applicants seeking advanced-standing status into the ND program must hold a first professional medical degree. Accepted are medical (MD), osteopathic (DO) and chiropractic (DC) doctors who have graduated from a regionally accredited institution. Satisfaction of this requirement meets the NUNM prerequisite condition for a bachelor's level degree. Transfer Credit Specific to the College of Classical Chinese Medicine Due to the classical orientation of the MSOM and DSOM programs, only a limited number of credits from programs with a traditional orientation are transferable. Applicants with completed coursework in U.S. institutions: Only AOM coursework completed at a school approved by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM) will be accepted for transfer. Applicants with completed coursework in international institutions: Transfer credit will be considered for applicants to the CCM degree programs who are deemed eligible to sit for NCCAOM licensing examinations. They must first submit their educational records to either the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) or World Education Services (WES) for a course-by-course educational transcript evaluation. Applicants with completed coursework in China: All applicants who choose to apply to AACRAO must first have their credentials verified via the China Academic Degrees and Graduate Education Development Center (CDGDC) and submitted directly to AACRAO. To apply with CDGDC, go to: chinadegrees.cn./en/. 2018-2019 Course Catalog | A dmissions 11 Health sciences programs have a societal responsibility to train competent graduates, healthcare providers and scientists who demonstrate critical judgment, extensive knowledge and wellhoned technical skills. Students and graduates are engaging in a profession that requires the highest standards of ethical conduct, honesty and professionalism. NUNM students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the high ethical standards expected of professionals who may be required to assume responsibility for the life, health and well-being of others. Every student is expected to demonstrate a level of competence consistent with these professional responsibilities and NUNM has the right to discipline, suspend or expel, at any time, any student considered unfit for a career as a practitioner of naturopathic and/or Chinese medicine, in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth in in the university student handbook. The technical standards define the essential functions that an applicant or student must be able to perform to be admitted to NUNM, progress satisfactorily through an NUNM program of study, and graduate. To be qualified for health sciences programs at NUNM, those individuals must be able to meet both NUNM's academic standards and the technical standards, with or without any reasonable accommodation as established by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Technical Standards for all Programs For entry, participation and graduation from all NUNM academic programs, students must have/be able to:Technical Standards and ExpectationsTransfer Credit Specific to the School of Graduate Studies Up to six (6) credits from regionally accredited, graduate-level programs may be transferred to count toward core courses in the School of Graduate Studies. All transfer credits are evaluated for relevance and are subject to approval by the program chair or dean. Transfer Credit Specific to the School of Undergraduate & Part-Time Studies Applicants to the School of Undergraduate & Part-Time Studies may transfer credit for courses that are substantially similar to courses offered as part of NUNM's undergraduate programs. Students are required to complete a minimum of 50 credits in the Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health Sciences program; 51 credits in the Bachelor of Science in Nutrition program; and 64.5 credits in the Bachelor of Science in Integrative Therapeutics\u2014Massage Therapy program at NUNM.All transfer credits must be completed at a regionally accredited institution, and are evaluated for relevance and subject to approval by the program chair or dean. Transfers from NUNM to Other Institutions Transfer of credit from NUNM to other institutions is at the discretion of the receiving institution. Credit generally depends on comparability of curricula and may depend on comparability of accreditation. NUNM is regionally accredited. Inquiries should be directed to the receiving institution to determine the transferability of credits from NUNM. Transfer of Core Credits and Electives Between NUNM Programs Graduate-Level Programs Some core course credits may be eligible for transfer among NUNM programs to satisfy program requirements. All transfer credits are subject to approval by the program chair or dean. Master and doctoral students may take elective credit from any NUNM graduate-level degree program, as long as they meet the prerequisites. Undergraduates Taking Cross-Listed Graduate-Level Courses Undergraduate students who are pursuing a baccalaureate degree at NUNM may take any elective course in the undergraduate program and cross-listed courses in graduate programs, as long as they meet the prerequisites. In addition, core courses in other undergraduate programs can be taken for elective credit (maximum of 18 credits). Technical Standards and Expectations | n unm.edu 12 I.

For the most current tuition and fees, please refer to the current NUNM catalog online at nunm.edu. Tuition and Fee Payment Policy When students register for classes at NUNM they incur charges on their account. Tuition and fees for each quarter are due and payable in full at the beginning of each term. Students are financially responsible for all classes for which they are registered by the due date, even if a class is added after the term has begun. Deadlines for payment are as follows: End of second week - Registration and transcript holds are placed on accounts with balances. End of fourth week - Late fees may be applied to accounts with outstanding balances. Adding a class - If added within the first two weeks of term, the deadline is the same as above. If added after the second week, payment for added classes is due and payable at the time of registration. Student billing is posted to the online billing system, Sonis. The university does not generate paper bills for students prior to the beginning of each term. The Business Office will strive to provide a courtesy paper statement to those with a balance due within the first two days of class. Students are not excused from paying their tuition bill by the posted deadlines if no paper statement is received since real-time billing is available online through their Sonis account. All tuition and fees are listed in U.S. currency. NUNM maintains tuition, fee and refund policies that are fair and uniformly administered. The Business Office may apply a late payment fee of $50 to a student's account unless the student has paid the balance due or made arrangements (i.e., a deferral promissory note) by the end of the fourth week of each quarter. Students unable to pay their entire financial balance must see the Business Office to make payment arrangements before the due date. A promissory note may be written to defer payment of tuition until the last day of the quarter. There may be a $20 fee assessed for each deferral. The Business Office may deny or rescind a student's eligibility for a promissory note if a student misses the required payment due dates, provides inaccurate or incomplete information, or has a poor credit history. Students are not permitted to register for a quarter until all money owed the university is paid in full from previous quarters. All students who elect to pay their account balances with a credit card (Visa, MasterCard or Discover) will be charged a convenience fee of 3 percent of the amount paid at the time of processing. Payments made by debit card and/or check will not be charged a fee. Credit for courses will not be given until tuition and fees have been paid in full. The Business Office may also block future registration until all debts have been paid in full. Transcripts or diplomas will not be issued to students if they owe the university any money, regardless of the source (e.g., outstanding clinic balances). Students with past due accounts who pay in full with a personal check will have transcripts or diplomas issued to them two weeks after payment. Any adjustments or modifications to the schedule of tuition charges are subject to the approval of the chief financial officer. Summer Quarter Financial Aid Considerations Summer is a non-standard term, and as such, students often find it difficult to enroll in courses that qualify for federal financial aid. In order to qualify for federal financial aid, students must meet the definition of half-time enrollment by enrolling in courses and/or electives that are required for degree completion in their program of enrollment. Students who have met their core and/or maximum number of elective requirements and who choose to enroll in additional summer terms are not eligible for financial aid. Change of Track A change of track requires a signature from the program dean. All change of track requests must be completed by week eight of the quarter prior to the quarter in which the change takes effect. Student Responsibilities 1. Students are responsible for ensuring that charges on their statement are correct and that all tuition for classes, lab fees, and other applicable fees have been applied. It is also the student's responsibility to pay all charges on their account by the due date, whether or not they have received a courtesy paper statement. If tuition and fees are being paid by parents or relatives on behalf of the student, the university Financial Policies 2018-20192018-2019 Course Catalog | F inancial Policies 15 regards this as a private arrangement between the student and the other third party. The university will deal directly with the student regarding the payment of fees or any queries regarding a student statement. 2. Students experiencing financial problems in the payment of any tuition and fees are responsible for contacting the Business Office to make satisfactory arrangements. 3. Students are responsible for keeping NUNM informed of their current contact information, as addressed in Section 3.1 of the student handbook. Students must submit changes to their contact information to the Registrar's Office. 4. Any assessment or judgment against a student for damage to NUNM property, whether arising from a Student Conduct Code proceeding or a court action, shall be considered money due NUNM as if it were tuition. No transcripts or diplomas will be released to the student until the amount due the university has been paid. The Business Office may also block future registration. NOTE: The university is not responsible for any loss of, or damage to, the personal property of a student. Other Expenses Students are required to purchase textbooks and other personal equipment, as well as basic diagnostic equipment for use in courses and clinic. These costs vary from year to year. Tuition and Fee Refund Policies Adding/Dropping Courses Students are responsible for formally withdrawing from classes they wish to drop. Students who fail to formally drop classes during the refund period are responsible for the tuition charges. Please note that fieldwork and cultural immersion trips are subject to a different refund schedule, detailed below. (See add/drop policy in Section 3.12 of the student handbook.) Week of Quarter Tuition Refund Rate First week 100% tuition Second week 75% tuition Third week 50% tuition Fourth week 25% tuition Beyond fourth week No refundExperiential Learning - Tuition and Deposit Refund Policies Many off-campus experiential learning experiences at NUNM require that travel/accommodation/catering arrangements be made well in advance. These include retreats and travel-based (trip) courses. The tuition and fee refund policies for such events differ from those of standard on-campus courses. Tuition will be refunded at the same schedule in Section 9.6 of the handbook if the student withdraws from the institution. Off-Campus Retreat Courses (e.g., qigong, CCM immersion and naturopathic medicine retreats) Students formally dropping a retreat prior to the start of the retreat can get full tuition reimbursement. However, they are not eligible for a retreat fee refund once the term has started. Shan Ren Dao Retreat Students must submit an application for this two-week retreat, and be interviewed and accepted prior to registration. The tuition and retreat fee refunds policy is the same as for other off-campus retreat courses. Travel-Based (Trip) Courses (e.g., global health experience trips, China trip) Students must apply and be accepted to travel-based (trip) courses. Once accepted, they will sign and submit an agreement to be registered for the travel, and are required to reserve their spot with a 50% deposit at the time of registration. The deposit will be charged to the student's NUNM account. The deposit is used to make travel arrangements, including accommodations and other travel-related expenses. The travel deposit may be assessed several months prior to the trip itself. After the travel deposit has been assessed, a student who wishes to drop the trip must submit an add/drop form and is subject to the following refund rates: Deposits for travel-based courses (excluding Shan Ren Dao and off-campus retreats) will be refunded at 100% up to eight (8) weeks prior to the departure date. If the course is dropped within eight (8) weeks of the start date, the deposit is non-refundable. Withdrawing from NUNM If a student finds it necessary to withdraw from the institution, the following policies apply: The application fee, submitted with the initial application for acceptance to NUNM, is nonrefundable.Financial Policies | nunm.edu 16 ND Studies: Lab and Other Fees (All lab fees are nonrefundable) All Cooking and/or Teaching Kitchen Courses (each) $ 50 ND Makeup Exam (written and quizzes) n o charge ND Makeup Lab Exam $ 100 ND OSCE 1 & 2 Initial Exam $ 185 ND OSCE 3 Initial Exam $ 310 ND OSCE 1 & 2 Retake (payable before Retake can be taken) $235 ND OSCE 3 Retake (payable before Retake can be taken) $360 ND Remediation (Makeup) Quiz Fee $ 25 ND Remediation Exam or Project (for FR/R grades) (fee each) $ 100 (payable before Remediation can be taken) BAS 5110L, 5120L, 5130L Structure and Function I-III Lab (each) $ 30 BAS 5111L, 5121L Clinical Anatomy I-II Lab (each) $ 85 BAS 5120T Structure & Function II Tutorial $ 10 BAS 5130T Structure & Function III Tutorial $ 15 CLE 827 Clinical Skills Enhancement Tutorial $ 650 CLE 828 ND OSCE Skills Tutorial $ 350 CLE 5120 Clinic Observation I $ 42 CLE 6212 Introduction to Clinic $ 25 CLS 6210T Musculoskeletal, Ortho, Exercise Physiology & Rehab Tutorial $ 25 CLS 6210L Musculoskeletal, Ortho, Exercise Physiology & Rehab Lab $ CLS 6211L Neurology Lab $ 20 Nephrology Tutorial $ 210 CLS 7311T Immunology Tutorial Lab $ 18 CLS 7321L Dermatology and Surgery Lab $ 50 CLS Pediatrics and Geriatrics Tutorial $ 40 CLS 7331L Parenteral Therapy and Environmental Medicine Lab $ 100 CLS 7332T Psychology and Mental Health Tutorial $ 20 NDEB 5110E, 5130E Northwest Herbs I-II (each) $ 45 NDEB 5210E Herbal Garden Processing $ 45 NDEC 6350E Simulation Lab $ 220 NDEC 15 NDET 6250E Nature Cure Lab $ 40 NMT/Orthopedic Synthesis V $ 25 NOS 723 Proctology Lab $4 0 THR 5120L, 5131L Therapeutics I-II Lab (each) $ 50 The acceptance deposit fee will be forfeited by a student who withdraws after accepting admission. Calculation of tuition refunds are based on the date the student begins NUNM's withdrawal process. Tuition refunds will first be applied to balances due NUNM. If a student receiving financial aid is eligible for a refund, that refund is returned to the Federal Financial Aid program. Tuition refunds for withdrawing students are calculated according to NUNM's tuition and fee refund policy outlined below: Week of Quarter Tuition Refund Rate First week 100% tuition Second week 90% tuition Third week 80% tuition Fourth week 70% tuition Fifth week 60% tuition Sixth week 50% tuition Beyond sixth week No refund Any refund of tuition and fees resulting from a withdrawal or a reclassification of tuition status must be applied to the recipient's financial aid awards before any payment is made to the student. Tuition refunds are calculated according to NUNM's tuition and fee refund policy. Return of federal Title IV funds is calculated according to Department of Education regulations. (See Financial Aid section for more information.) Students whose accounts were paid-in-full often have a balance due NUNM after withdrawal. The Title IV return of funds policy operates independently of the university's tuition refund policy. It is possible for a withdrawing student to owe NUNM money because aid must be returned to the Title IV program, but the student is not entitled to a refund of institutional charges. Federal regulations for this refund policy allow the university to retain an administrative fee that reduces the institutional charges subject to refund. This fee is 5 percent of total charges, up to a maximum of $100. Furthermore, federal regulations require that any student who has received a loan while attending NUNM and who leaves the university for any reason, including official leaves of absence, must participate in a loan exit interview. Exit interviews are conducted by the Financial Aid Office and can be arranged by calling that office.

Complete NUNM's Application for Admission (available Sept. 3, 2018). Students must be admitted before a financial aid package can be awarded. 2. Complete the 2019-2020 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), available on Oct. 1, at fafsa.ed.gov. The federal Title IV school code for NUNM is B07624. Depending on when you intend to take classes, you may need to apply for financial aid for both the current academic year as well as the upcoming academic year. If you're not sure, please check in with the Office of Financial Aid. NUNM's priority application deadline is Feb. 15. Financial Aid Census Date In accordance with federal regulations, the Financial Aid Office will verify each student's enrollment status on the published census date by the Office of the Registrar, which is the first Monday of the third week of each term: summer, fall, winter and spring. This policy typically coincides with the end of the add/drop period for each term. If the enrollment status has changed, the Financial Aid Office, as required by federal regulations, will recalculate federal, state and institutional student aid awards. If the change in enrollment status, prior to completing 60% of the term, causes a student to become ineligible for all or a portion of the financial aid award, the student will immediately be responsible for repaying those funds that have been disbursed to them. Eligibility for these federal programs may also be affected for those who have had FAFSA information or corrections submitted after the census date. This policy does not apply to students who withdraw from all courses. Complete withdrawals from the institution are subject to federal, state and institutional refund policies. If students drop classes (or change their class status to audit) after the census date, they may also have future financial aid eligibility issues. Please review the add/drop policies in the student handbook for more information on the requirements to maintain financial aid eligibility. Students experiencing unusual circumstances can request an appointment with the director of financial aid. Scholarships Money received from scholarship sources does not have to be repaid. At NUNM there are limited scholarships available for both entering and matriculated students. NUNM matriculated scholarships are administered by the Advancement Office. In order to be assured of full consideration for available scholarships, completed applications for admission and scholarship awards, along with all supporting documentation, must be received in the Admissions or Advancement Offices by the appropriate deadline dates. NUNM anticipates awarding scholarships to both new and returning students enrolled during the academic year. The amount and availability varies for all scholarships from year to year. Scholarship recipients must maintain satisfactory academic progress as a condition for receiving a scholarship. Failure to do so will result in cancellation of the scholarship. This policy applies to both internal and external scholarship funding sources. Admissions Scholarships Decisions on scholarship awards for incoming students are based on a holistic evaluation of the entire application file and are made at the same time admissions decisions are made. Applicants do not need to complete a separate application for these scholarships. For more information about these scholarships, please contact the Admissions Office at 503.552.1660. NUNM Enrolled Student Scholarships All current full-time students in good academic standing are encouraged to apply for student scholarships.

Federal and State Aid Programs Pell Grant A federal Pell grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid. The federal Pell grant program provides funds to students demonstrating financial need, and are awarded only to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Students who will receive federal Pell grants, and have the most financial need, will receive FSEOGs first. The Financial Aid | nunm.edu 20 FSEOG does not need to be repaid. Unlike the federal Pell grant program, FSEOG funds are often exhausted before the end of the school year. Interested students should be sure to submit their FAFSA applications as early as possible. Oregon Opportunity Grant The Oregon Opportunity Grant program was created by the Oregon State Legislature to help needy Oregon students to attend Oregon colleges. Oregon residents who attend NUNM may be eligible to receive an Oregon Opportunity Grant. These grants are awarded on the basis of financial need, based upon the information provided on your FAFSA. Students who already have a bachelor's degree are not eligible to receive an Oregon Opportunity Grant. More detailed information regarding the Oregon Opportunity Grant is at oregonstudentaid.gov/oregon-opportunity-grant.aspx. Federal Loans The majority of students find it necessary to borrow loans to fund their educational expenses. The amount of education loans available will depend on a student's program(s) of enrollment. The student should keep in mind the amount of loans they choose to borrow and their overall indebtedness, and that the money borrowed will have to be repaid with interest. All students interested in federal loans must complete and submit the FAFSA. You can apply for loans at any time throughout the academic year. Types of Federal Loans Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan Subsidized Stafford Loans are available for students enrolled in undergraduate programs. Loans have both interest and principal payments waived during enrollment (at least half time) periods and during the grace period. Eligibility for this program is based upon need, class level, and annual and cumulative limits. Students who borrow Subsidized Stafford Loans must complete entrance counseling and a Master Promissory Note (MPN). For more information, go to studentloans.gov. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Unsubsidized Stafford Loans are available to undergraduate students and graduate or professional students. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans have principal payments waived during enrollment (at least half time) and during the grace period. The student borrower must elect to make interest-only payments while attending school or defer payments. Deferred interest payments will be capitalized (added to the principal balance) at repayment. Eligibility for this program is based upon dependent status, class level, and annual and cumulative limits. Student borrowers who elect to borrow both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans (if eligible for both) may complete one MPN for both programs. Borrowers who have not completed entrance counseling must do so before completing an MPN. For more information, go to studentloans.gov. Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) The parent PLUS loan is available to parents of undergraduate students. The PLUS loan program is credit-score based. This loan is limited to the difference between the student's cost of education and the student's financial aid. Parents who want to borrow a PLUS loan must complete a PLUS Loan Certification Request form. If a parent borrower is unable to secure a PLUS loan, the undergraduate dependent student may be eligible for additional unsubsidized loans to help pay for his or her education. Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan Program The Graduate Plus Loan program is available to graduate students that need to fill the gap between other forms of financial aid and the student's cost of attendance budget. Students should keep in mind that the interest on these loans continues to accrue while enrolled in school, and that the interest rates are generally higher than the Federal Direct Stafford Loan program. A credit check is required and an endorser option may be available. There is no grace period on this loan and repayment begins 60 days after the final loan disbursement; however, students are eligible to request an in-school deferment on this loan. For more information, contact the Financial Aid Office. Aggregate Graduate Loan Limits for Master's Degree Programs The maximum amount of student education loans is limited federally to $20,500 per nine-month period (academic year), and cannot exceed a maximum borrowing amount of $138,500\u2014of which no more than $65,500 can be in subsidized loans. This aggregate limit includes undergraduate loan debt and applies to students enrolled solely in master's degree programs. Aggregate Undergraduate Loan Limits The maximum aggregate amount of federal loans is limited to students enrolled in an undergraduate degree program. The maximum aggregate amount of DEPENDENT undergraduate loans a student may be eligible for is $31,000\u2014of which no more than $23,000 may be in the form of a subsidized loan. The maximum aggregate amount of INDEPENDENT undergraduate loans a student may be eligible for is $57,500\u2014of which no more than $23,000 may be in the form of a subsidized loan. 2018-2019 Course Catalog | F inancial Aid 21 Students who have received more than their aggregate cap are considered to have been over-awarded, and as such, must resolve the over-award prior to being considered eligible for federal Title IV financial aid. Annual loan limits apply and students should contact the Office of Financial Aid for further information. Alternative Loans Alternative (private) loans are administered and processed by private lending institutions, and are to be used for educational costs after first exhausting potentially more favorable federal and state financial aid options. Contact the Financial Aid Office or visit nunm.edu to search for an alternate loan product through ELMSelect. Exhaust Federal Student Aid Options First Alternative loans are not part of the federal student loan programs, and should only be used in circumstances where you have exhausted all other options in regard to financing your education. It is highly recommended that students apply for financial aid using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) prior to seeking an alternative loan. You may be eligible for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program. Additional information about direct loans can be found by contacting the Financial Aid Office or visiting nunm.edu. Benefits of direct loans over an alternative loan may include lower interest rates and better repayment options. Eligible students who elect to decline participation in the Federal Direct Loan program to borrow an alternative loan must contact the NUNM Financial Aid Office to schedule a counseling session and sign a \"Federal Student Loan Waiver\" form. NUNM Emergency Loans The university provides emergency loan assistance on a short-term basis to students experiencing financial hardship resulting from unexpected emergency situations. A maximum of $500 may be borrowed, and a $10 processing fee is charged for each loan. Emergency loans are considered a loan of last resort and available at the discretion of the director of financial aid to students with an acute immediate need. Additional criteria for this loan is outlined in the application process. Students cannot borrow more than one emergency loan per academic year, cannot borrow this loan in the final term of an academic year, and must have this loan repaid in full prior to the end of the respective term. For more information, students can make an appointment to meet with the director of financial aid for consideration. Emergency Loan Examples: Personal/Family Crisis - a situation or period in which things are very uncertain, difficult or painful; especially a time when action must be taken to avoid complete disaster or breakdown Disaster - an event that causes serious loss, destruction, hardship or death Tragedy - serious illness, financial ruin or fatality Theft - having property stolen, vehicle damage, etc. Student Loan Fund Disbursement Procedures All financial aid funds are disbursed quarterly through the Business Office. The Business Office applies financial aid funds to a student's account for unpaid tuition and fees at the time funds are received by the institution. If financial aid funds are in excess of tuition and fees, the resulting credit balance will be refunded to the student to use for other education-related expenses. Refund checks that are available at the start of fall/winter/spring terms are distributed by the Business Office staff on the first day of the term. Refund checks that become available after the first day of classes, or at any time during summer term, are placed in student mailboxes. If a student receives financial aid after the term begins, any resulting credit balance will be refunded by the Business Office within 10 business days of receipt of the funds by the institution. The refund check will be placed in the student's mailbox. Credit balances resulting from any other financial activity, such as dropped classes, in the first three weeks of the term will be refunded in week four of the term (after the add/drop period has ended and tuition has become due). Credit balances resulting after week three from any activity other than receipt of financial aid funds will be refunded in weeks six, eight, ten or twelve of the term. Refund checks will be placed in student mailboxes. Professional Judgment Review The U.S. Department of Education gives the director of financial aid the authority to make adjustments to a student's financial aid package in cases involving unusual circumstances through a process known as professional judgment. Students experiencing unusual/unexpected financial circumstances during the academic year can request a meeting with the director of financial aid to request a review. An academic year is defined as a period of enrollment during the current FAFSA year. Students under review will be required to sign a release to provide specific documentation. The professional judgment review process is solely at the discretion of the director of financial aid, and all outcomes whether approved or denied are final and ineligible for appeal.Financial Aid | nunm.edu 22 Change of Program Track and Adding/Dropping Courses - Effect on Financial Aid Students receiving federal financial aid must provide their Student Status Change form or Add/Drop form, and schedule a meeting with the Financial Aid Office staff to discuss program changes that may affect their eligibility for financial aid. Federal Title IV Refund Procedure Title IV funds are awarded under the assumption that the student will attend school for the entire period for which the assistance is awarded. When a student withdraws they may no longer be eligible for the full amount of Title IV funds that they were originally scheduled to receive. Students who withdraw from the program before week eight of any quarter may be eligible for a refund. If a student receiving financial aid is eligible for a refund, that refund is returned to the Federal Financial Aid program. If the amount of the refund exceeds the total amount of aid, the excess will be returned to the student. Students whose accounts were paid in full often have a balance owed to NUNM after withdrawal. The Title IV Return of Funds policy operates independently of the university's tuition refund policy. It is possible for a withdrawing student to owe NUNM money because aid must be returned to the Title IV program, but the student is not entitled to a refund of institutional charges. Federal Title IV funds are always returned in the order mandated by the U.S. Department of Education: For graduate-level students, the order is: 1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan 2. Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan For undergraduate-level students, the order is: 1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan 2. Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan 3. Federal Direct Parent PLUS 4. Pell Grant 5. FSEOG The calculation of Title IV funds earned by students has no relationship to their incurred institutional charges. Up through the 60 percent (60%) point in each payment period or period of enrollment, a prorated schedule is used to determine the amount of Title IV funds students have earned at the time of withdrawal. After the 60 percent (60%) point in the payment period or period of enrollment, students earn 100 percent (100%) of the Title IV funds they are scheduled to receive during the period. For a student who withdraws after the 60 percent (60%) point-in-time, there are no unearned funds. However, an institution must still determine whether that student is eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement. Federal refund calculations are independent of NUNM's tuition refund policies. NOTE: The federal Title IV refund calculations apply to changes in enrollment status and withdrawals from all classes. However, if a student changes track and there is an adjustment made to the tuition charges, the Financial Aid Office will recalculate the student's cost of attendance budget for aid eligibility. Federal regulations require that any student who has received a loan while attending NUNM and who leaves for any reason, including official leaves of absence, must participate in a loan exit interview. Exit interviews are conducted online at studentloans.gov. Federal Work-Study Program The federal work-study program (FWSP) is a federally subsidized program and is available to students as an additional resource to earn money to help cover educational expenses. Due to the demands of the academic programs, students generally find their schedules limit the amount of time they can work to 20 hours per week or less. The number of students receiving an award is limited by the program funding received by the university, and is awarded to students as applications are received, until the funding is fully utilized. Students are encouraged to complete the FAFSA form by Feb. 15. The Financial Aid Office administers the federal work- study program and maintains an online timesheet database. Student employees earn an hourly wage and are paid monthly. Federal Work-Study Conditions and Limitations The following are mandated conditions and limitations regarding student employment, and are summarized as follows: Federal work-study is governed by any and all applicable federal, state and/or local laws. Federal work-study must not displace employees or impair existing service contracts. Replacement is interpreted as displacement. Federal work-study employees must be paid for all hours worked. The Fair Labor Standards Act prohibits employers from accepting voluntary services from any person who has been compensated for those worked hours.2018-2019 Course Catalog | F inancial Aid 23 Students receiving, or eligible to receive, federal work-study funds may not receive institutional student employment funds. To view a list of current work-study opportunities, please visit nunm.edu/workstudy. Search all departments to see all jobs posted for the year. Only eligible federal work-study students currently attending NUNM are eligible to apply for these positions. Student Employment Program The student employment program (STEP) operates independently from the federal work-study program. The STEP program is open to international students only. Limited positions exist and students employed by this program are subject to the budgeted funds of the hiring department. Students employed through STEP cannot work under the federal work-study program. See mandated conditions and limitations regarding student employment under Federal Work-Study Conditions and Limitations.Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy Federal regulations require schools to monitor the academic progress of each applicant for federal financial assistance, and that the institution certify that the applicant is making satisfactory academic progress (SAP). Students who meet SAP requirements maintain their eligibility for federally funded programs. Students must maintain SAP toward a degree in order to continue in the program and to continue to receive federal, state and institutional financial aid. \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" is defined as passing all program requirements, maintaining pace of progression to complete their degree, and completing their program of enrollment within the published timeframe. Students who do not meet the minimum standards will find their financial aid eligibility in jeopardy. For a complete explanation of the financial aid SAP policy for both graduate and undergraduate programs, contact the Financial Aid Office. Financial Aid Policy and Drug-Related Convictions Students are ineligible for federal Title IV aid if convicted of an offense involving the possession or sale of illegal drugs. The period of ineligibility is contingent upon the offense committed and on whether the student is a first-time or repeat offender. (Information on Oregon and federal sanctions, and periods of ineligibility, is available from the Office of Financial Aid and in the student handbook.) Eligibility and Rehabilitation Drug Rehabilitation To restore Title IV eligibility early, students must successfully complete a qualified drug rehabilitation program. This program must conduct two unannounced drug tests and receive, or be qualified to receive, funds directly or indirectly from a federal, state or local government program. Government Program An acceptable government program is one that is administered or recognized by a federal, state or local government agency or court. The drug rehabilitation program must be qualified to receive, or is currently receiving, payment directly or indirectly from a state-licensed insurance company; or administered or recognized by a state-licensed hospital, health clinic or medical doctor. College of Naturopathic Medicine | n unm.edu 24 Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic medicine is a primary care approach to health and wellness that focuses on restoring and optimizing health. It is a distinct system of health care\u2014an art, science, philosophy and practice of diagnosing, treating and preventing disease. This art of natural healing has deep roots in ancient history and developed during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries from the German hydrotherapy movement. This new art was nurtured by medical as well as non-medical practitioners into rigorous hospital- and spa-based practices that were ultimately practiced worldwide. Natural healing developed incrementally and has been shaped and refined in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century. Traditional naturopaths embrace the belief that health is influenced by each individual's inherent healing ability. In this paradigm of vitalism, disease is viewed empirically as a direct result of ignoring or violating the general principles of health. Practitioners aim to correct and stabilize these environments as their primary interventions to ward off disease. Modern naturopathy can be viewed as an evolving system of practices that bridge elements of conventional, alternative and traditional medical practices to enhance an individual's self-healing processes and support wellness. Naturopathic physicians are clinically trained, licensed primary care physicians who have graduated from an accredited postgraduate four-year naturopathic medical school. They work with patients in all aspects of family health to identify the underlying causes of disease and provide evidence-informed therapies to help facilitate the body's ability to restore and maintain optimal health. A Brief History: Naturopathic Medicine in the U.S. and NUNM Drs. Benedict and Louisa Lust brought \"nature cure\" medicine from Europe to the United States in 1896 and helped develop the term naturopathy. Benedict Lust is widely credited for establishing naturopathic medicine in North America. However, the important contributions of Louisa Lust in establishing naturopathy are less well-known. Born Aloesa Strobele, Louisa was a financially successful business woman and the physician in charge of the Bellevue Sanitarium, a prominent nature cure spa in Butler, New Jersey, before she met and then hired Benedict as chief medical director\u2014and financed the first naturopathic college. Together they renamed the Bellevue as Yungborn, where they advanced nature cure. NUNM honors both Lusts as the architects of naturopathic medicine in North America. By the early 20th century, naturopathic medicine was flourishing throughout the country. Naturopathic doctors were licensed in a majority of states. There were more than 20 naturopathic medical colleges; the most prominent was Lust's American School of Naturopathy in New York City. Naturopathic medical conventions at that time attracted more than 10,000 naturopathic physicians. At the same time, there was strong support emerging for what is now known as conventional or allopathic medicine.The Flexner Report of 1910 was commissioned through the Carnegie Foundation as a critical examination of medical education in the United States and Canada. Its goal was to lend credence to the standardization of medical education admissions, licensing and practice. It ultimately led to radical reforms in medical education and training. Abraham Flexner, who graduated from John's Hopkins University with a Bachelor of Arts degree, was the founder of an experimental high school and was known to be critical of the American education system. He eschewed all medical approaches that he deemed lacking in scientific research and validity. Naturopaths, in particular, came under greater scrutiny as the allopathic medical profession questioned the viability of naturopathic medicine. Pressure to close naturopathic schools and eliminate the profession began to gain momentum. Naturopathic medicine experienced a precipitous decline in the 1940s and '50s with the emergent rise of pharmaceutical medicine and technological advances. The concept that Flexner introduced, that naturopathic medicine was quackery or charlatanism, became prevalent. Naturopathic licensing was largely discontinued. Schools either complied with the call to eliminate curricula for naturopathy or closed their doors. From NCNM to NUNM As the last naturopathic degree program was terminated at Western States College of Chiropractic and Naturopathy in Portland, Oregon, naturopathic doctors banded together to find a way to save the profession from extinction. NDs from around the country raised money to create a school they College of Naturopathic Medicine The mission of the College of Naturopathic Medicine is to educate and train physicians in the art, science and research of naturopathic medicine2018-2019 Course Catalog | C ollege of Naturopathic Medicine 25 would fight to keep open for generations to come. In 1956, Drs. Frank Spaulding, W. Martin Bleything and Charles Stone signed incorporation papers, establishing National College of Naturopathic Medicine (NCNM) in Portland, Oregon. From its founding until 1979, NCNM was the only naturopathic medical college in North America. Established by those who began practicing in the 1920s and '30s, NUNM (first known as National College of Naturopathic Medicine, more recently as National College of Natural Medicine, and now as National University of Natural Medicine) has been at the center of the profession for more than 60 years, preserving and extending the legacy of naturopathic medicine by educating and training future physicians. Since 1998, the profession has experienced resurgence and tremendous growth as an increasingly health-conscious public sought alternatives for conditions that conventional medicine does not adequately address. This growth is in direct response to the changing needs of our society. The public is demanding a medical model in which the individual plays a more active role in their own health and healing process; naturopathic doctors want a practice that is more patient-centered and holistic. This convergence of needs, and the beneficial healthcare outcomes that patients experience from naturopathic treatment, has led to the increasing popularity of naturopathic medicine. At the same time, more state legislatures are approving licensure for naturopathic medicine. Today, NUNM is alma mater to thousands of naturopathic physicians. Our graduates practice in a rapidly growing number of U.S. states, territories, Canadian provinces and foreign countries. Many are nationally acclaimed healthcare experts, as well as successful physicians. Since 1956, when a determined group of NDs launched a new era in naturopathic education, NUNM alumni have forged new pathways that fundamentally improve the health of our communities on a national scale, and in doing so they are advancing the naturopathic profession. This is an exciting time to join the profession and continue making history in the field of naturopathic medicine. Scope of Practice Naturopathic physicians' scope of practice varies by jurisdiction. Currently, 20 states, five Canadian provinces, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have laws regulating naturopathic doctors (NDs). Scope varies between states, including differences in pharmaceutical prescribing, minor surgery, IV & IM administration, diagnostic imaging/labs, and childbirth attending or midwifery. The jurisdictions that regard NDs as primary care physicians provide them with a diagnostic and therapeutic scope of practice. These include general and preventive health care, as well as diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic conditions. In jurisdictions where NDs are not regulated, the scope of practice flourishes as adjunctive care since the practices of diagnosis and treatment of disease tend to be excluded. Licensing and Credentialing of Naturopathic Physicians Naturopathic doctors are legally recognized to practice medicine throughout the United States and U.S. territories, Canada, as well as many other countries. NDs are fully licensed in: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont and Washington. They are also licensed in Washington D.C., the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. In other U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions, a varying scope of naturopathic practice may be permitted or protected by court decisions, attorney general opinions or local regulations. The best sources of current information about the legal status of naturopathic medicine in a particular area are the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (naturopathic.org), state or provincial naturopathic associations, and individual naturopathic physicians practicing in those areas. Currently, all states that license naturopathic physicians require graduation from a residential course of study offered through an accredited institution approved by the examining jurisdiction. NUNM meets all requirements of, and is accredited by, the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). Completion of the ND degree at NUNM qualifies candidates to sit for the national licensing examination-the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Exam (NPLEX), which is a key requirement for licensure. Some jurisdictions have College of Naturopathic Medicine | n unm.edu 26 additional examinations, for example in Oregon, there are additional examinations in jurisprudence and prescribing formulary pharmaceuticals due to Oregon's wider scope of practice. It is also routine for regulators to require a fingerprint-based national criminal history search. Similar to other healthcare providers, recently graduated NDs are encouraged to seek additional clinical experience under the supervision of a licensed physician in the form of residencies and mentorships. It should be noted that the state of Utah requires a one-year residency before licensing NDs. In some states, insurers are showing credentialing preference to those with postgraduate residencies. Residencies NUNM is proud to lead the profession in developing and administering the first and largest accredited graduate medical education program. We now offer more than 60 accredited residencies. Our residency program is rigorous and competitive; it provides invaluable clinical experience to assist our graduates in completing the transition toward becoming practicing physicians. With established residency programs both locally and throughout the United States, we work with specialty providers and renowned hospitals-including an integrative rotations partnership with Oregon Health & Science University here in Portland, Oregon.

Systems-Based Practice: Effectively call on system resources to provide care that is of optimal value.The Six Philosophical Principles of Naturopathic Medicine The practice of naturopathic medicine emerges from six principles of healing. These principles are based on the objective observation of the nature of health and disease, and are examined continually in light of scientific analysis. These principles stand as the distinguishing marks of the profession: First Do No Harm primum non nocereTherapeutic actions that are complementary to, and synergistic with, the body's innate healing process reduce harm to patients. Naturopathic physicians follow three precepts to avoid harming the patient: Use methods and medicinal substances that minimize the risk of harmful effects, and apply the least possible force or intervention necessary to diagnose illness and restore health. Whenever possible, avoid symptom suppression as it can interfere with the healing process. Respect and cooperate with the vis medicatrix naturae in diagnosis, treatment and counseling. The Healing Power of Nature vis medicatrix naturaeThe body has the inherent ability to establish, maintain and restore health. The healing process is ordered and intelligent; nature heals through the response of the life force. The physician's role is to facilitate and augment this process, to identify and remove obstacles to health and recovery, and to support the creation of a healthy internal and external environment. Identify and Treat the Cause tolle causamIllness does not occur without cause. Underlying causes of disease must be discovered, and removed or treated, before a person can recover completely from illness. Symptoms are expressions of the body's attempt to heal, but are not the cause of disease; therefore, naturopathic medicine primarily addresses the underlying causes of disease, rather than the symptoms. Causes may occur on many levels, including physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. The physician must evaluate fundamental underlying causes on all levels, directing treatment at root causes as well as seeking relief of symptoms. Treat the Whole Person in perturbato animo sicut in corpore sanitas esse non potest Health and disease are conditions of the whole organism, involving a complex interaction of physical, spiritual, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental and social factors. The physician must treat the whole person by 2018-2019 Course Catalog | C ollege of Naturopathic Medicine 27 taking all of these factors into account. The harmonious functioning of all aspects of the individual is essential to recovery from and prevention of disease, and requires a personalized and comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment. The Physician as Teacher docereBeyond an accurate diagnosis and appropriate prescription, the physician must work to create a healthy, sensitive interpersonal relationship with the patient. A cooperative doctor-patient relationship has inherent therapeutic value. The physician's major role is to educate and encourage the patient to take responsibility for her/his own health. The physician is a catalyst for healthful change, empowering and motivating the patient to assume responsibility. It is the patient, not the doctor, who ultimately creates or accomplishes healing. The physician must strive to inspire optimism as well as understanding. The physician must also make a commitment to her/his personal and spiritual development in order to be a good teacher. Prevention principiis obsta: sero medicina curaturThe ultimate goal of naturopathic medicine is prevention of disease. This is accomplished through education and promotion of lifestyle habits that foster good health, and through secondary prevention modalities, including those promoted by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The physician assesses risk factors and hereditary susceptibility to disease, and counsels patients on methods to avoid further harm and risk. The physician places the greatest emphasis on building health. Because it is difficult to be healthy in an unhealthy world, it is the responsibility of both physician and patient to create a healthier environment in which to live. Diagnostic Techniques NDs are trained in diagnostic techniques, such as physical exam, laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging and psychological assessment. NDs endeavor to identify disease states in the context of the individual's overall health. Therapeutic Techniques Botanical Medicine: Many plant substances are powerful medicines. Where isolated, chemically derived drugs may address only a single problem, botanical medicines are able to address a variety of problems simultaneously. When properly administered, most botanical medicines can be applied effectively with minimal chance of side effects. Clinical Nutrition: Food is the best medicine and is a cornerstone of naturopathic practice. Many medical conditions can be treated effectively with foods and nutritional supplementation, with fewer complications and side effects. NDs use diet, fasting and nutritional supplementation in their practices. Homeopathic Medicine: Homeopathic medicine is the treatment of disease/symptoms using correctly prescribed, minimal doses of natural substances (plant, animal, mineral), which, if taken in larger doses, would cause disease/symptoms\u2014the acting principle being \"like cures like.\" It promotes the return to health on physical, mental and spiritual levels. Mind-Body Medicine: Mental attitudes and emotional states may influence or even cause physical illness. Counseling, nutritional balancing, stress management, and other therapies are used to help patients heal psychologically. Minor Surgery: Naturopathic physicians perform in-office minor surgery, including repair of superficial wounds and removal of foreign bodies, cysts and other superficial lesions. Naturopathic Natural Childbirth/Midwifery: T rained and licensed naturopathic physicians facilitate natural childbirth in an out-of-hospital setting. They offer prenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care using modern diagnostic techniques combined with ancient midwifery wisdom. NUNM offers an elective course sequence resulting in a Natural Childbirth/Midwifery Certificate that allows students to apply for separate licensure in naturopathic natural childbirth. Pharmaceutical Medicine: While naturally derived pharmaceutical drugs have been within the scope of naturopathic practice in Oregon for decades, in 2009 state legislation expanded the formulary and licensed naturopathic physicians may use most prescription pharmaceutical agents commonly employed in a primary care setting. The law become effective January 2010. Consistent with our conventional counterparts, and depending on the individual licensing laws of each state, naturopathic physicians may utilize a wide formulary of pharmaceutical medications when deemed appropriate for patient care\u2014and always in consideration of our naturopathic principles. Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine | n unm.edu 28 Physical Medicine: Naturopathic medicine utilizes therapeutic manipulation of soft tissue, muscles, bones and spine. NDs also use ultrasound, diathermy, exercise, massage, water, heat and cold, and other gentle electrical therapies in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions and pain. Parenteral Therapy: Intravenous and intramuscular injections of micronutrients and macronutrients are used for many purposes, from simple nutritional support to detoxification procedures in cases of exposure, and specific treatment of both chronic and acute diseases. Nature Cure: The use of time-honored natural treatments including fresh air, exercise, whole foods and hydrotherapy are important in the naturopathic treatment and prevention of disease.Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine The Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) degree is an intensive four-year program that fosters the development of a uniquely skilled type of physician, one who is capable of delivering comprehensive health care with a heart. Our approach is personalized care with the intent to change lives. We teach our students to think, critique and develop their individual strengths as healers; to customize evidence-informed therapeutic options to each patient's situation and preferences; and to motivate and educate patients on how to live with less pain, burden and suffering. Once the immediate needs of a patient are addressed, our physicians move on to wellness coaching and motivating their patients to live, eat, sleep and exercise better; manage stress; and reduce risk factors for chronic disease. Ultimately, we train our physicians to provide positive transformation, improve quality of life, and reduce burden where possible. This is primary care of the future, where terrible burdens of current chronic disease epidemics are delayed or altogether curbed by fundamental changes in lifestyle. Our entire program is focused on how to succeed in practice, how to curb the current epidemic of chronic disease, and how to make a meaningful and positive impact on the communities we serve. NUNM Health Centers The strong support of our state and county health authorities sets NUNM apart from other naturopathic medical schools. Our students intern in our two state-credentialed Tier 4 Patient-Centered Primary Care Homes (PCPCH), which have become widely accepted as exemplary models for how primary care should be organized and delivered. Our interns are trained to use electronic medical records (EMR) equipped with evidence-informed therapeutics, evaluation and clinical decision guidance tools, and referrals to investigations and medical specialists\u2014all in real time. Our EMR system allows for collaboration with major hospitals in the Portland area\u2014and links to health providers all across the nation. At NUNM's primary care homes, students learn how to anticipate, guide and coordinate the care of even the most complex of cases with specialists, behavioral and mental health providers, and community partners. Program Overview Our ND program combines primary care with the foundation of evidence-informed traditional nature cure. We focus on experiential education and our students 2018-2019 Course Catalog | D octor of Naturopathic Medicine 29 benefit from a preceptorship program, simulation labs, diverse clinical experiences, internships and research. Our curriculum is delivered in an innovative, clinically integrated system where students encounter real patients and clinical scenarios as early as their first quarter\u2014followed by progressive and challenging clinical rotations during the first three years of the program. This design prepares students to smoothly transition into the role of physician in their fourth year, under the watchful mentorship of more than 65 accomplished academic and clinical teachers. Students in the ND program experience a rigorous biomedical education, an inspiring journey into healing philosophy and practice delivered through the core themes of cultural literacy, ethics and professionalism, evidence-informed practice, naturopathic philosophy, and practitioner cultivation. Each theme is led by one or more of our dedicated faculty to ensure that every block of the curriculum prepares the physicians of tomorrow to thrive in the current and challenging environments of healthcare provision in the U.S. Stepping Stones First-year classroom studies include the normal structure and function of the body with a solid introduction to naturopathic theory, philosophy, therapeutics and medical systems. Students enter the clinic in an observational capacity and begin preceptorships in the first year. The second- and third-year didactic curriculum focuses on organ system block courses that integrate all aspects of the normal and abnormally functioning system, including pathophysiology, prevention, evaluation and diagnosis of disease. Therapeutic modalities, including botanical medicine, clinical nutrition, physical medicine, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, and other natural and pharmacological methods are woven throughout all organ systems courses. All courses highlight cultural competency, ethics, evidence-informed decision-making, medical jurisprudence, naturopathic philosophy, communication skills and professionalism, while emphasizing a whole-system approach to optimal health and wellness. Second-year clinical experience continues with preceptorships and hydrotherapeutics. After the completion of second-year coursework, students are eligible to sit for the NPLEX Part 1 Biomedical Science exam. The third-year clinical curriculum consists of practical training as a secondary intern in a variety of supervised settings, ranging from community-based clinics to the on-campus medical health center. To advance to secondary status, students must pass a clinical proficiency examination, or OSCE 1 (Objective Structured Clinical Examination). The fourth year is focused on clinical training as a primary intern as well as elective coursework. To attain primary status, students must pass the OSCE 2 exam, with a final OSCE examination required for graduation. Our graduates complete 1,264 clinic hours , which include more than 500 supervised patient contacts. Because the program is rigorous and the course load heavy, students may apply to complete the ND degree in five rather than four years. In some cases, students may be required to be in the five-year track. Students may take no more than seven years to complete the ND program. While at NUNM, students may undertake any two programs concurrently (e.g., ND/MSOM, ND/MSiMR, MSOM/MScN, etc.). Contact the Office of Admissions for more information.

Students are required to apply to be included in the program, to ensure that they can be scheduled in the required courses while they are pursuing their naturopathic medicine degree. Contact the Registrar's Office for further information. Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine | n unm.edu 42 Natural Childbirth/Midwifery Certificate The natural childbirth/midwifery program at NUNM is a synthesis of the philosophies of natural medicine and traditional midwifery. Although NUNM's program is didactic only, and does not include the experiential aspects of training, it prepares students to seek further education through clinical preceptorships, should they so choose. With dual training as a naturopathic physician and midwife, naturopathic midwives are uniquely qualified to provide comprehensive health care for women and their families throughout their lives. The Natural Childbirth/Midwifery Certificate program provides the didactic education necessary for a graduate to complete requirements to sit for the American College of Naturopathic Obstetricians (ACNO) licensing examination. These courses are in addition to the required Reproductive Systems block course in the ND program, and are comprised of six elective courses. Students receive instruction in the natural process of pregnancy, labor and birth, while also being trained in detection and management of unusual and emergency situations. Students intending to include natural childbirth in their practices must complete the entire didactic sequence of coursework to familiarize themselves with the management of pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum and neonatal periods.Program coursework meets Oregon licensure requirements for the certificate of natural childbirth, and is recognized by Washington state midwifery requirements. Both states also require practical clinical experience, which is not included in this certificate program. Individuals interested in practicing naturopathic midwifery in other areas should contact local governing agencies to inquire about requirements. Students must be in good academic standing and may apply for the program in their third year of the naturopathic medicine program. Although NUNM does not formally offer a clinical component, the College of Naturopathic Medicine can assist with connecting students with qualified preceptors in the community. Students who are interested in a clinical preceptorship will be interviewed by the preceptor. Unfortunately, due to limited available positions, not all students will be offered a clinical preceptorship. ND Graduate Medical Education (Residency) Program At the end of their accredited naturopathic medical program, NDs can become licensed for practice once they have successfully passed their NPLEX board exams and have completed state licensure requirements. However, postgraduate education and training is highly encouraged. There are increasing opportunities for further clinical education in the form of naturopathic residencies, and NUNM leads the profession\u2014we developed and administer the first and largest graduate medical education program certified by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). Currently, residency placement is a highly competitive process. In addition to earning a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine degree from an accredited institution, candidates must demonstrate professionalism, maturity, commitment to serve, excellent clinical abilities, and an aptitude for enhancing their clinical skills. NUNM is committed to assisting the profession in developing an adequate number of residency opportunities to allow the graduates of all accredited naturopathic degree programs to receive the benefits of graduate medical education.

Why? Because we find the classical approach to be exceptionally fascinating and effective. The roots of Chinese Medicine extend back thousands of years\u2014to the wisdom and work of cultivated individuals who understood that human beings are microcosms of the natural world. They recognized that everything in the material world, including the human body, is a creation and reflection of a higher dimension of reality. Health and harmony can be achieved by living in accordance with the laws of nature, and in alignment with one's most authentic expression. Deeply attuned to the rhythms of nature, ancient yangsheng (\"nurturing life\") practitioners learned to read the map of that higher reality (the Dao ) as it imprinted in (literally \"in-formed\") the physical realm. The symptoms of disease were not seen as errors to be eradicated, but were instead read as signals of a disharmony that could be resolved to regain the experience of wholeness.It is of immeasurable benefit to the profession that we still have access to the wisdom of the ancients through works referred to as the \"classical texts\" of Chinese medicine. While some consider these texts to be curious museum- worthy artifacts, classically oriented practitioners recognize and honor them as key resources in the essential quest of unlocking the secrets of true health and happiness. But the texts are not easy to decipher\u2014the journey requires a steadfast seriousness of purpose. The combinations of classical Chinese characters comprising these works are rich, etymological word fields having many layers of symbolic meaning. Discerning the depth of meaning contained in even a short passage can require the rhythmic interplay of scholarly inquiry, contemplative practice and ultimately, the illumi nation of one's direct clinical experience. Therefore, even excellent scholarly translations capture only a fraction of the richness contained in the original language. This is why it is extremely valuable to study with faculty having expertise in the texts, and (if one is so motivated) to develop one's own capacity to enter the texts directly through the original classical characters. The texts become a doorway to a vast trove of timeless wisdom and knowledge. College of Classical Chinese Medicine The Classical Approach at NUNM Heiner Fruehauf, PhD, LAc, was pursuing scholarship in Sinology (the study of Chinese language, literature and history) when he entered the profession of Chinese medicine through the doorway of his own health challenges. An essential feature of his medical education was lineage-style apprenticeship with renowned experts in Daoist and classical Chinese medicine. When hired by NUNM in 1992, Dr. Fruehauf's mission of developing a unique offering in Chinese medicine was inspired and informed by discussions with his Chinese mentors. Their vision continues to attract a group of like-minded scholar-practitioners from across Asia and the West who are committed to training students excited to explore and embody the richness and power of the classical approach to Chinese medicine. Many have access to knowledge that is not typically taught in any Western language. NUNM offers two CCM programs\u2014the Master of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM) and Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine (DSOM). The MSOM is fully nested within the DSOM, with the latter having an additional 48 credits and 582 hours. Students in both programs gain a strong classical orientation to the medicine. A primary goal of the DSOM program is to set graduates firmly on the path of the scholar-practitioner, capable of uncovering ancient knowledge and integrating it into modern-day clinical practice. In addition to learning to read and translate the classical texts, DSOM students gain a more complete understanding of the philosophical, historical and cultural context of the medical texts, and later developments in Chinese medicine based upon these texts. The doctoral curriculum also prepares graduates to more fully embody the knowledge, skills and behaviors required for classical Chinese medicine practitioners to integrate, communicate and collaborate within the biomedicine-based healthcare system.The College of Classical Chinese Medicine is committed to transmitting the art, science and spirit of Chinese medicine to cultivate clinical practitioners rooted in the ancient tradition of the medical scholar.College of Classical Chinese Medicine | n unm.edu 50 Overview of the CCM Programs The following provides a year-by-year tour through the CCM programs. All information applies to both the MSOM and DSOM; content that is specific to the DSOM program is noted. Year One: Immersion in the Way of Classical Chinese Medicine Theory/Knowledge Students learn the fundamental theory and principles of Chinese medicine, and become familiar with the historical, philosophical and cultural context in which the many streams of Chinese medicine arose in mainland China. Having gained a solid introduction to the classical roots of the medicine, students then examine the origins and potential strengths and limitations of the modern TCM approach. DSOM: Students receive more extensive training in the historical, philosophical and cultural context of many of the major classical texts of Chinese medicine Skills Students become adept at point location and begin to practice freehand needle insertion. They practice musculoskeletal/myofascial palpation, and begin their training in Chinese medicine diagnostic techniques, including tongue and pulse diagnosis. Students also gain fluency in sensing the flavor, nature and movement of individual Chinese herbs and herb combinations, and develop critical thinking and research literacy skills. Cultivation Students begin a series of nine weekly qigong practicums and weekend retreats, held in ancient forest, mountain and hot springs settings. In these courses, students refine their awareness of qi flow by engaging in the \"nourishing life\" practices of the Jinjing Gong lineage, one of China's authentic alchemical life science traditions. Recognizing that development into a thriving business person is an integral element of cultivation, the business series of courses starts in the first quarter of the program. The goal of this series is to equip students with the knowledge, skills and resources needed to conceptualize, start-up and successfully manage a profitable practice that is personally and professionally rewarding. DSOM: A key component of cultivation training in the DSOM curriculum starts in the first year with the classical texts series of courses. Through the study and acquisition of the classical Chinese language, students develop a form of cognitive capacity that transcends Western rational, dualistic thought. The goal is to engage a way of knowing that will enrich each clinical encounter and enhance clinical outcomes. Another key feature of the DSOM program is a series entitled \"Imaginal and Experiential Inquiries\" (IEI) that is threaded throughout every quarter of the curriculum. These courses have a small group format and emphasize reflective learning, appreciative inquiry, and self-awareness exercises to promote each student's personal engagement with the curriculum and to support their professional development. Through the process, students choose and hone their doctoral capstone topics. In year one of the IEI series, the resources, challenges and unique perspective of each student are explored. A first-year theme is the role of metaphor in medicine, in particular how it relates to Eastern versus Western perspectives on the body. Biomedicine While the first year of the curriculum has a focus on research literacy and critical thinking, it does not emphasize biomedical knowledge. The goal is to immerse students in the language of Chinese medicine without promoting the natural tendency to translate new learning into the more familiar framework of biomedicine. Clinic In the spring quarter, students are introduced to the practical and philosophical fundamentals of working in the NUNM health centers. Year Two: Exploring How it All Comes Together\u2014Embodiment and Integration Theory/Knowledge Students study classical models of human pathology and expand their knowledge of acupuncture prescription and Chinese herbal formulation. They deepen their 2018-2019 Course Catalog | C ollege of Classical Chinese Medicine 51 understanding of CCM as a macrocosm/microcosm symbol science as they explore the cosmology and symbolism associated with the 12 Chinese organ networks. Skills Students continue to build their hand skills through the acquisition and practice of bodywork and acupuncture tonification and dispersion techniques. They are introduced to the art of medicinal food preparation, and to classical methods of herb processing. Cultivation The qigong and business series continue, and a practitioner cultivation course promotes self-reflection and increased awareness of personal resources and challenges. DSOM: In the second year of the classical texts series, students translate the Huangdi Neijing, with an emphasis on clinical application of the knowledge gleaned from this seminal text of Chinese medicine. The theme of the second-year IEI series is \"awareness of awareness.\" Biomedicine The biomedicine series starts in the second year. The foundation gained in the first year of the program provides students with the background needed to integrate biomedical knowledge into the more expansive framework of CCM. This approach is in conscious contrast to the modern trend of interpreting Chinese medicine from within the material confines of the biomedical perspective. The College of Classical Chinese Medicine believes that the brilliance of biomedicine is most powerfully applied within the context of whole-systems science, and that Chinese medicine can truly flourish only when understood and applied according to its own precepts and tenets. Clinic Students enter the clinic in the second year as they observe seasoned clinical faculty diagnose and treat patients using individual lineage styles of practice. Year Three: Refining Clinical Skills and Developing a Medical Mind Theory The third year is devoted to the advancement of clinical reasoning. Incorporating modern and classical case analysis, students learn to compare and integrate biomedical, TCM and classical approaches to patient diagnosis and treatment. DSOM: Third-year students gain a deeper functional understanding of the acupuncture channels by studying the symbolic meaning of the acupuncture point names. They also study the symbolic meaning of herb names. Skills Students hone their palpation, perception and clinical reasoning skills, with a focus on applying them to the diagnosis and treatment of disease. In addition to learning advanced manual and needling techniques, students practice adjunctive acu-moxa modalities, including moxibustion, cupping, guasha, bleeding and teishin. The refinement of clinical skills includes the use of microsystems in diagnosis and treatment. It also includes standard physical examination and assessment methods from the biomedical approach. Cultivation The qigong series concludes with an emphasis on clinical application, and the business series continues with an emphasis on marketing and business systems. A two-course series explores the classical understanding of what in the West is characterized as psychological dysfunction, including the role of the emotions in chronic disease. These courses encourage the exploration and understanding of one's own self-limiting patterns. DSOM: In the third year of the classical texts series, students translate the Shanghanlun and Jingui Yaol\u00fce , with an emphasis on clinical application. The theme of the third-year IEI series is \"developing a medical mind.\" Biomedicine As the biomedicine series continues, the Western approach to the diagnosis and treatment of disease is compared to, and integrated with, TCM and CCM approaches. The third year includes courses on the biomedical under- standing of nutrition and public health. Clinic The third-year clinical rotations enhance the confidence and competence of students in preparation for the internship phase of training. In the clinical mentoring rotations, students engage directly in the intake and treatment of patients under the complete guidance of their clinical supervisor. In a spring quarter pre-internship rotation, students become familiar with the process and responsibilities of being an intern by shadowing and supporting the interns who are about to graduate. College of Classical Chinese Medicine | n unm.edu 52 Year Four: Becoming a CCM Practitioner Theory/Skills In the fourth year, students undertake one of the signature features of the program\u2014a yearlong Traditional Mentorship Tutorial (TMT) series. The small-group, apprentice-style format of this unique offering affords students the opportunity to absorb the lineage system of their chosen mentor. Many students elect to do more than one TMT series. Review courses help prepare students for the national board exams. The herbs review course is combined with training that prepares soon-to-be graduates with the knowledge and skills required to run a successful herbal medicinary. Cultivation Qi cultivation continues in the fourth year with three taiji practicums. The second of two practitioner cultivation courses focuses on relationship dynamics between the practitioner and patient. The final course in the business series prepares students to be successful, fulfilled and ethically/legally upright with regard to the business and practice management aspects of their professional life. DSOM: Students receive additional training in systems- based medicine, providing an understanding of the broader healthcare system necessary to coordinate care within this system, and to collaborate effectively within a multidisciplinary healthcare setting. The theme of the fourth-year IEI series is \"the courage to be vulnerable.\" The IEI series, Doctoral Capstone Tutorial, and Doctoral Capstone Mentorship (run by the chair of the student's capstone committee) support students through the completion of the three parts of their doctoral capstone project: a written report, an oral presentation and a professional practice vision statement. Biomedicine DSOM: To ensure that DSOM graduates are prepared to communicate effectively with providers in the broader biomedically based healthcare system, they complete cutting-edge coursework exploring the relationship between Chinese medicine and biomedicine models of understanding the pathological basis, diagnosis and treatment of disease. Clinic During the final year of study, students step into the role of intern and assume an increasing level of responsibility 2018-2019 Course Catalog | C ollege of Classical Chinese Medicine 53 for the diagnosis and treatment of patients under the expert supervision of clinical faculty. Through an application process, each intern is paired with a clinical faculty mentor, with whom they experience at least one internship rotation per quarter throughout the final year. This provides students continuity of training in their resonant style of practice and long-term management of patient cases. DSOM: In addition to participating in one or more primary care teams with naturopathic physicians at NUNM's multidisciplinary campus health center, DSOM interns have the opportunity to complete one or more rotations at NUNM's multidisciplinary community clinic sites (e.g., the Richmond Clinic at Oregon Health & Science University and the Integrative Medicine Program at Providence Hospital Cancer Center). Electives MSOM and DSOM students are required to complete 6 and 10 elective credits, respectively, for the purpose of rounding out their education. Students are encouraged to take electives through the College of Classical Chinese Medicine, which deepen the student's connection with the classical roots of the medicine. In addition, students may also take elective courses through the College of Naturopathic Medicine and School of Graduate Studies (as long as course prerequisites are met). The CCM-specific electives include coursework in such subjects as arts, Yijing, bazi suanming, qimen dunjia, weiqi (a form of Chinese chess), and Confucian Five-Element emotional healing (Shan Ren Dao Retreat). These courses provide valuable tools and opportunities for cultivation, and connect students with the milieu of the ancient sage-practitioner.

A more useful translation might be \"the ultimate exercise.\" From a Chinese medical perspective, taiji harmonizes the \"three treasures,\" jing, qi and shen (essence, energy and spirit). Its precisely choreographed movements create a relaxing mind-body dance that stretches and strengthens the entire body; its slow, deliberate moves develop balance and grace; its meditative style facilitates harmonious breathing and a focused mind. There are many variations within the world of taiji; a modified Yang style form is the one taught at NUNM. Over three quarters, students learn the sequence of moves along with the principles of movement that accompany them, and an inward-looking focus that emphasizes the cultivation and awareness of qi. The taiji courses are open to all NUNM students.

Clinical Training Overview The clinical training objectives of the CCM programs are aligned with the overall mission of training competent practitioners in the art and science of classical Chinese medicine. The clinical aspect is expected to be a refinement of the knowledge base acquired in the academic portion of the program, with the implicit understanding that many important skills can only be attained in the applied context of a practical learning situation. These skills include, but are not limited to: Development of foundational knowledge and understanding of classical Chinese medical concepts and techniques Evolution of interpersonal communication abilities Refinement of problem-solving capacities and clinical judgment Proficiency in executing the technical skills required to effectively apply treatments in Chinese medicine To begin the Observation component, students must complete the first year of study and pass Herbs I-III, Acu-Moxa Points and Techniques I-III, Palpation and Perception I-II, Chinese Diagnostic Techniques I-II, Evidence-Informed Practice, and Introduction to Clinic.

In addition, students must pass all components of the Clinic Entrance Examination. An Internship orientation is required before beginning the Internship rotations. Students are gradually led through the clinical experience in a sequential fashion, from active observation to being able to conduct a comprehensive patient intake and treatment protocol. In the spirit of the classics, emphasis is placed on recognition of Chinese syndrome pattern differentiation (rather than symptomatic prescribing), with the goal of creating individual treatment plans designed to assist patients in returning to a more harmonious and balanced state. Training in how to write a case report (using the CARE Guidelines) is woven through all four years of the clinical education. In order to complete the clinical portion of their program, students must pass the Clinic Exit Examination. CM 530 - Introduction to Clinic (0.75 clinic credit) This course introduces students to the fundamentals of working in the NUNM clinics. Topics include clinic policies and procedures, hygienic standards, charting, patient confidentiality, patient-practitioner relations, issues surrounding addiction and chemical dependency, and cultural humility. The course prepares students to begin observing treatments with a focus on the material and nonmaterial changes that take place throughout treatment, and to support the supervisor efficiently and effectively. Note: additional fee required CM 600 - Clinical Observation I-III (2 clinic credits each) Clinical observation is a forum in which five observers watch the clinical supervisor in session with a client. While observing, the objective is to absorb as much of the method and process of clinical practice as possible. Students practice creating patient timelines for case reports. Prerequisites: students must be CPR certified, have passed the CNT course, and have completed CM 530 CM 700 - Clinical Mentoring Rotation I-VI (2 clinic credits each) Clinical mentoring rotations have the same structure as the clinical observation rotations, with the addition that students become more directly involved in the patient intake, diagnosis and treatment, under the direct guidance of their clinical supervisor.

The MScGH degree program is designed for students who desire to understand the complexity of global health challenges and contribute to solutions in a meaningful way. The world has become smaller through the ease of international travel and technology, yet the disparity in health outcomes between countries has never been greater. Many low-resource settings lack the means to implement a biomedical approach to health and wellness, thus these are places where public health and integrative, traditional medical strategies can thrive. Students are required to travel as part of their global health training; first with a global health experience course on a guided trip to one of several destinations in the U.S. or abroad and, second, after finishing all foundational coursework, students plan and implement a supervised fieldwork project in a practice-based setting. This fieldwork course allows students to obtain real-world experience with current challenges and opportunities in global health. At least one of these courses must include travel outside of the U.S. Definitions Used in the MScGH Program Traditional Medicine \"Traditional medicine is the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness.\" (From: World Health Organization. General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine . Geneva, Switzerland. 2000.) Complementary/Alternative Medicine (CAM) \"The terms 'complementary medicine' or 'alternative medicine' are used inter-changeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system.\" (From: World Health Organization. General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine . Geneva, Switzerland. 2000.) Integrative Health \"Integrative health is a state of well-being in body, mind and spirit that reflects aspects of the individual, community and population. It is affected by: 1) Individual biological factors and behaviors, social values, and public policy, 2) The physical, social, and economic environments, and 3) An integrative healthcare system that involves the active participation of the individual and the healthcare team in applying a broad spectrum of preventive and therapeutic approaches. Integrative health encourages individuals, social groups, and communities to develop ways of living that promote meaning, resilience and wellbeing across the life course.\" (From: Witt CM, Chiaramonte D, Berman S, et al. Defining health in a comprehensive context: a new definition of integrative health. Am J Prev Med . 2017;53(1):134-137.)

This new and expanding model of care incorporates complementary therapies, such as nutrition, mind-body medicine and somatic therapies, with the best of conventional treatments. The Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health (MSiMH) degree combines integrative medicine and mental healthcare training for a truly unique, multidisciplinary and collaborative learning experience. This holistic approach to mental health provides students with concrete skills in biopsychosocial assessment, evaluation, diagnosis, and integrative and conventional therapies. The experiential curriculum is designed to enhance self-awareness and facilitate self-exploration. Candidates should be prepared to explore their own personal psyche, to be vulnerable with their peers and instructors, and to use their own psychological material for learning how to work with clients. Several courses are delivered in a weekend format, allowing sufficient time and a safe space for deep exploration and processing. Students explore how their personal identity as a healthcare professional is shaped by what they learn about themselves. Throughout this process, students have ample opportunity to practice new psychotherapeutic techniques as they support one another in self-exploration. Group supervision is built into the program, and students work closely with mentors to conceptualize and manage cases, practice skills, and continually reflect on their own experience and growth as a practitioner. Graduates will be equipped to address the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental health disorders from an integrative medicine perspective. Because the MSiMH degree does not qualify students to sit for licensing exams as a professional counselor, candidates must be concurrently enrolled in a clinical degree program at NUNM that will provide them with a degree or license to work with patients in a medical context (ND, MSOM or DSOM). The MSiMH program is designed to provide students with additional training in mental health disorders and psychotherapeutic approaches to healing, and graduates will be prepared to more effectively address mental health care within the scope of their individual licenses. MSiMH is a cohort-based program, thus students move through the core curriculum in lockstep together. The prerequisite for all core courses is that students have passed each prior course in sequence. The mission of the integrative mental health program is to train practitioners in the biological, psychological, social and cultural foundations of mental and emotional health. The program strongly emphasizes the use of applied mindfulness; the cultivation of interpersonal therapeutic presence; and the application of natural medicines and interventions for an innovative and holistic approach to prevention, personal growth and treatment.Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health | n unm.edu 108 Program Outcomes and Competencies Students in the MSiMH program will be prepared to meet the following program outcomes and competencies: 1.

The old adage \"you are what you eat\" has never been truer. The Master of Science in Nutrition (MScN) degree program focuses on diets that are based on whole, unprocessed foods and integrates nutritional biochemistry and pathophysiology with advanced clinical nutrition knowledge. An active-learning curriculum provides a solid foundation in holistic nutrition and food systems, complemented by skill-training in cooking, teaching and nutritional counseling. Nutrition is a dynamic science with new research findings constantly being published. As we continue to learn about the complex relationship between food and human metabolism, there is no argument that whole and minimally processed foods are better for reducing disease risk. Fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds provide us with many beneficial nutrients beyond vitamins and minerals. However, each individual also has their own unique nutritional needs. No one diet is right for everyone. Focusing on each person as an individual allows for variation of dietary needs that provide the best nutritional support possible. Nutrition books are top-sellers, demonstrating that the public wants more information about nutrition. Simultaneously, obesity is at an all-time high and chronic disease continues to rise. This paradox demonstrates that nutrition knowledge is not translating to individuals' ability to make dietary changes. People need help and support to make significant behavioral changes. In order to make nutrition accessible to every individual in every community, we need a nutritional philosophy that embraces cultural preferences. We need to treat food as medicine. The Master of Science in Nutrition program at NUNM prepares its graduates for a variety of settings, including health coaching and nutritional counseling, nutrition research, serving on integrative healthcare teams, being a personal chef and professional food service consultant, and involvement in community nutrition educational programs. Master of Science in Nutrition The mission of the Master of Science in Nutrition program is to advocate for healthy lifestyles by increasing awareness of how food and nutrients impact human health and disease, and to respect diverse nutritional needs, dietary patterns, and food preferences.2018-2019 Course Catalog | M aster of Science in Nutrition 117 Program Tracks One Year This is the standard program track, beginning in the fall term and ending in the summer.

It involves paying attention to thoughts, feelings and body sensations in a way that increases awareness, acceptance and self-compassion to help manage difficult experiences, and create space to make wise choices. Guided imagery is a technique used to evoke feelings of relaxation and is based on the concept of mind-body connection. Mind-body connection upholds the interaction between body and mind as one important factor in a person's overall health and well-being. In guided imagery, a person can call on mental images to facilitate an improved sense of well-being. MT 442E - Advanced Movement Massage (2 lab credits) In this course, students learn movement-based techniques and advanced body mechanics that utilize leverage, client and therapist movements, and gravity to perform the work. Technique systems like Thai massage, shiatsu, and various pin and stretch techniques all use a combination of client and therapist movement to produce the force and pressure utilized during massage sessions. Consistent with the massage program is the utilization of the law of parsimony, combined with current knowledge of physiological effects of massage and point work, to deliver classes that teach the fundamental ideas behind each technique. The desired result is that students will have a deeper, more advanced understanding of how various movements work to help people in pain; how they can be incorporated into a massage therapy setting; how best to apply these techniques and forces; and how to teach clients about them in the most accurate and ethical ways. Prerequisite: Must be in last year of BSiT-MT program or current LMT MT 443E - Hydrotherapy (1 lecture credit and 1 lab credit) This course presents the therapeutic values of hydrotherapy-related modalities as employed in a massage therapy setting.

Issues concerning clarification of indications, contraindications, precautions and physiological effects of various forms of applications are addressed.MT 444E - Dermoneuromodulation (1 lecture credit and 1 lab credit) Dermoneuromodulation is a structured, interactive approach to manual therapy that considers the nervous system of the patient during a manual therapy session. Specific techniques used are slow, light, gentle and responsive, and can be very effective. Positioning of limbs and trunk affects deeper nerve trunks (by shortening and widening their container), and is combined with skin stretching directed toward cutaneous fields of nerves that branch outward into the skin. MT 445E - Making Your Own Lotions, Oils, Creams and Emollients (2 lecture credits and 1 lab credit)This course is all about making your own creams, lotions, oils and emollients from natural ingredients. Create and adapt bases to these and other water soluble solutions for various uses, including massage therapy. Students have complete control over formulas and the flexibility to adapt recipes to their own requirements and specifications. Students are encouraged to think and use creativity to develop their own products. It is a practical, hands-on course with lecture time being used to deliver fundamental information to be applied during the creation processes. Natural Sciences Electives NS 341E - Environment and Health (3 lecture credits)The role of the environment on health issues is often underplayed. This course surveys current environmental health issues, such as hazardous waste and water-borne diseases, as well as emerging global health threats including global warming, ozone depletion and sustainability. Positive influences of the environment on health are also discussed. NS 342E - Plants of the Northwest (3 lecture credits) This course introduces students to important flowering and food plant species of the Pacific Northwest. Specific topics include the use of taxonomic keys; plant anatomy; plant ecology; preservation and preparation of plant specimens; and species identification through lectures, lab activities and field trips to study native species in their habitats. Students explore the reciprocal relationship between food plants and people in the Northwest from the perspectives of foraging for wild foods, domestication of food plants, and the therapeutic approaches toward healing through plant awareness and horticulture.

This course teaches students how to critically evaluate news articles by locating the original research and assessing the original medical literature. In addition, students learn how to apply the medical literature to a nutrition plan for themselves or others.NU 423E - Foundations of Cooking Techniques (2 lecture credits and 1 lab credit) In order to practically apply nutrition theory to real meals, cooking skills are required. This course teaches students how to prepare and cook nutritious food for individuals or groups. Additional 'art of cooking' components are introduced, and students begin experimenting with flavors.Note: additional fee required NU 436E - Nutrition for Exercise and Sports (3 lecture credits) This course investigates the basic, scientific and applied concepts of nutrition and substrate utilization as they apply to energy production for exercise, body composition, weight control and thermoregulation. Emphasis is given to analyzing nutritional requirements for enhanced exercise and sport performance. NU 437E - DIY Kitchen Staples (2 lab credits) This course covers how to make commonly purchased, healthy, kitchen staples. Students participate in recipe planning and evaluation, and hands-on preparation of foods (e.g., nut milks, non-dairy cheeses, yogurt, fermented vegetables, hummus/vegetables spreads, crackers and energy bars). This course also reviews ingredients found in packaged foods, including additives and preservatives, and evaluates their role in foods and any health consequences to their consumption.Note: additional fee required 2018-2019 Course Catalog | U ndergraduate Electives 149 Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities Electives SS 402E - Human Sexuality (3 lecture credits) This course is designed to ground students in the foundational basics of human sexuality. Sexuality is the way our gender and sexual orientation influence how we act in the world and the way the world reacts to us. Healthy sexuality means having an accurate and positive view of ourselves, and using that as a basis for our relationships and life choices. This course examines sexuality not just as a physical act, but also as a philosophical concept. Students are introduced to concepts and issues related to topics of: consent, sexual identity, sexual orientation, gender, relationships, reproductive politics, sexual violence, love, and cross-cultural human sexuality. By the end of this course, students will have a more critical and dynamic understanding of sexuality and how these topics directly impact their lives.

All continuing students register for the upcoming academic year's fall classes by the end of spring quarter. Students may attend only the specific course sections for which they are registered. Non-adherence to this policy will result in no credit for the course. Students will not be registered for courses, labs or clinic shifts that occur at overlapping times. Credit will be earned for only one course during any given segment of time. All changes in courses and sections must be made through the Office of the Registrar. Students cannot register for elective courses that overlap with core classes, including travel courses, unless pre-approved by their program dean. Students must submit a \"Petition to Overlap Classes\" form for the dean's approval prior to registration. Students who wish to register for less than the full-time curriculum must complete a \"Petition to Deviate\" form and receive written approval from the Center for Academic Success and/or program dean. No student may add or begin classes after the end of the second week of any quarter. Eligibility to Register Matriculated degree-seeking students are eligible to register for NUNM courses. A non-degree seeking student is someone who has not matriculated into a degree program at NUNM. Students who have matriculated into a degree program and have taken a leave from their primary program may not take courses as a non-degree student. Non-degree seeking students must complete a \"Non-Degree Seeking\" application, which is available through the Office of Admissions. Once approved, the non-degree student must obtain signatures from the program dean and faculty member, as well as meet the prerequisites for the course. Approval is based upon space availability and meeting prerequisite requirements. Graduates of accredited NUNM programs may apply for entry into certificate programs offered at NUNM, provided they meet the specific requirements.Practitioners seeking continuing education units (CEUs) should contact the Office of Development. Credit Hour Policy Credits are awarded based upon hours of instruction. NUNM is on a quarter system. A quarter is defined as 12 weeks (summer quarter is 11 weeks). Credits for coursework are awarded according to the following: 1 lecture credit = 12 hours instruction per quarter + 24 hours per quarter outside of class time1 laboratory credit = 24 hours instruction per quarter + 12 hours per quarter outside of class time1 clinical credit = 24 hours instruction per quarter + 12 hours per quarter outside of class time1 tutorial credit = 12 hours of instruction per quarter + 24 hours per quarter outside of class timeCredit hours will not be adjusted if individual students utilize more or less study time as listed above, and will be held responsible for knowing all material. Students who feel they require additional study time should seek resources from the Center for Academic Success. Challenge Examinations - Graduate Level Only NUNM policy allows an individual to challenge by examination the content of a required course. Applicants who have been accepted may request to challenge a course prior to matriculation. This option is only available to students who have appropriately documented prior graduate coursework and there is a question as to whether or not the information covered sufficiently meets NUNM requirements. Transfer credit policies and course descriptions are outlined in the university catalog and are available from the Office of Admissions. There must be a difference in hours between a transfer course and the university's course and/or a question of equivalency of material covered in order for a challenge exam to be given. After the challenge exam has been administered, the grade is recorded and the student is notified of the results. If the student fails the exam, they must register for the course and pay the appropriate tuition. To be considered for a challenge exam, the student must: Complete transfer credit review during the admissions process to identify which courses may be eligible for challenge. Students who are applying for transfer credit reviews must sign the \"NUNM Transfer of Credit Agreement\" form upon admission to the university. Transfer credits will not be considered after matriculation. Submit a \"Transfer/Challenge Exam\" form (obtained from the registrar) to the program dean and the instructor (to which the challenge exam is related) for approval. Once permission is obtained, the program dean (or designee) will facilitate arrangements for the student to take the challenge exam. Pay the appropriate fees and submit an \"Exam\" form, located in the Faculty Support Office, to the instructor before taking the exam. See the Financial Policies section for information on fees. Take the challenge exam prior to the offering of the course that is being challenged; the exam must 2018-2019 Course Catalog | A cademic Policies 153 be taken, graded, and the grade submitted to the registrar no fewer than two weeks prior to the start of the quarter in which the course is offered. The following statement is for veteran students inquiring about prior credit: Any veteran receiving GI Bill\u00ae benefits while attending NUNM is required to obtain transcripts from all previously attended schools and submit them to the VA school official (located in the Registrar's Office) for review of prior credit. Auditing Students may audit a lecture course, space allowing, if they have met the prerequisites, have obtained the instructor's signature, and have registered for the course. The course will appear on the student's official transcript as an audit, even though auditing means that a student will not be evaluated or receive credit. Classes taken as an audit must be declared by the end of the quarter's second week. Audited courses are not eligible for challenge exams. See the Financial Policies section for information on fees. Attendance and Participation NUNM fosters a rigorous and engaging academic educational environment. Students are encouraged to attend all classes, tutorials and labs. Students are responsible for learning the content from any classes that they miss. Due to the nature of practicals classes (e.g., tutorials, labs, etc.), attendance, preparation and active participation are imperative and cannot be made up. NUNM expects a minimum attendance of 80% of all courses. Each syllabus will define the course attendance requirements and will stipulate the number of permitted class absences. Students absent more than the permitted number may be subject to a reduced grade or failure of the course. Faculty may take into account the level of participation and habitual tardiness when calculating a course grade. Students are responsible for being aware of, and for meeting, their faculty's attendance expectations, which are detailed in each course syllabus. Students who believe they have a disability that inhibits their attendance and participation in class or clinic are encouraged to contact the Center for Academic Success to discuss potential accommodations. The clinical attendance policy is outlined in the Student Clinic Section of the student handbook. Grading and Promotion NUNM maintains high standards of scholarship, and recognizes its responsibility to provide each student the best opportunity to complete their program(s) successfully. At the beginning of each course, the instructor is required to define clearly for class members the objectives of the course and the standards and methods by which student Academic Policies | nunm.edu 154 achievement will be measured. Students are responsible for checking their grades online in SONIS. Courses that are graded using the \"P/F\" grading system are not included in a student's GPA. For students enrolled in any program (fall 2015 or later) , at the end of each quarter, each student's course performance is reported to the registrar using the following letter grading system. A student's grade-point average will be calculated using the following chart: Grade Percentage Points A 90-100 4.0 B 80-89 3.0 C 70-79 2.0 D 60-69 1.0 F 59 or less 0.0 W/WF N/A Not calculated A (SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE): passing B (SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE): passing C (MARGINAL PERFORMANCE): passing D (UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE): not passing for graduate-level courses, passing for undergraduate F (FAILURE): not passing, permanent grade P (PASS): satisfactory performance W (WITHDRAWAL): student withdrew from course WF (WITHDRAWAL, FAILING): student withdrew from course while failing I (INCOMPLETE): course requirements not yet completed, due only to serious illness or bereavement (temporary grade) T (TRANSFER): course received approved transfer credit. Transfer credit does not apply toward overall GPA calculation AU (AUDIT) IP (IN PROGRESS) R (REMEDIATION REQUIRED): marginal performance (temporary grade) - graduate level only RP (REMEDIATED PASS): grade given for a passed medical clinic rotation, but with required skills remediation - graduate level only RC (REMEDIATED C): pass remediation exam - graduate level only For students enrolled in the ND or CCM programs prior to fall 2015, at the end of each course, each student's performance is reported to the registrar using the following pass/fail grading system: H (HONORS): superior performance; equivalent to \"A,\" not available for all courses P (PASS): satisfactory performance; equivalent to \"B\" or \"C\" FR (FAIL REMEDIATE): marginal performance (temporary (REMEDIATED equivalent to \"C-\" F (FAILURE): unsatisfactory performance (permanent grade); equivalent to \"F\" I (INCOMPLETE): course requirements not yet completed, due only to serious illness or bereavement (temporary grade) W (WITHDRAWAL): student withdrew from course WF (WITHDRAWAL, FAILING): student withdrew from course while failing AU (AUDIT) CMP (COMPLETE): used for courses that are not graded, but attendance is required and a specified number of hours need to be completed, such as preceptor hours T (TRANSFER): course received approved transfer credit. Transfer credit does not apply toward overall GPA calculation NC (NOT COMPLETED): hour requirement or attendance not met IP (IN PROGRESS) Grade of \"R/FR\" - Graduate level \"R\" (remediation required) or \"FR\" (fail remediate) is a temporary grade. Students who fail a course may receive an \"R/FR\" grade rather than an \"F\" (fail) if they meet the criteria and have the opportunity to take a remediation exam to pass the course. \"R\" grades are converted to either an \"RC\" (remediated \"C\") if the remediation exam is passed or a \"D/F\" if the remediation exam is failed. \"FR\" grades are converted to either an \"RP\" (remediated pass) or \"F\"\u2014not to a \"P\" or an \"H.\" A grade of \"R\" or \"FR\" cannot be converted to a \"P\" or \"H\" grade. Grades of \"R/FR\" are not eligible for grade appeals. Students who receive two or more \"R/FR\" grades (regardless of whether they have been changed to \"RC/RP\") will be placed on academic probation and must sign an academic contract. Students earning three or more \"R/FR\" grades (regardless of whether they have been changed to \"RC/RP\") will be required to appear before the Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC), and may be suspended. An \"R/FR\" grade that has not been remediated by the end of the second week of the following term (e.g., a spring 2018-2019 Course Catalog | A cademic Policies 155 term course should be remediated by the end of the second week of summer term) will automatically be converted to an \"F.\" Grade of \"RC/RP\" - Graduate level Students who pass the remediation exam will earn a permanent grade of \"RC (remediated \"C\")/RP (remediated pass).\" Clinical A permanent grade of \"RP\" will be given when an ND student passes a clinical rotation, but is required to attend a clinical skills enhancement course to attain an adequate level of clinical proficiency. An \"RP\" grade will also be given if a student receives a passing grade on a clinic rotation, but was recommended for remediation more than once. CCM: Grades of \"RP\" are given when a supervisor believes a clinical weakness exists and has not been adequately improved upon by the end of the rotation. The CCM student will be required to remediate with either the associate dean of clinical education or the supervisor in order to attain an adequate level of clinical proficiency. Grade of \"D/F\" - Graduate Level For graduate-level students, a letter grade of \"D\" or \"F\" is considered a failing grade. A failing grade in a required course (including clinical rotations) requires the student to repeat the course/clinic rotation the next time it is offered, usually the next year. If it is an elective course that is failed, the student is not required to retake it\u2014however, the student is strongly encouraged to do so as they will remain on probation and/or can trigger an ARAC meeting if further courses are failed. The student is prohibited from continuing in any courses for which the failed course is a prerequisite. The student will repeat the course at the current per-credit rate. Any naturopathic student failing a clinical rotation will be required to register for and attend skills-building. Grade of \"F\" - Undergraduate Level When an undergraduate-level student receives a failing grade, the course must be repeated the next time it is offered, usually the next year. The student is prohibited from continuing in any courses for which the failed course is a prerequisite. The student will repeat the course at the current per-credit rate. Grade of \"I\" When a student cannot complete a course in the term in which it begins, an incomplete (\"I\") grade may be considered. The granting of an \"I\" grade is at the discretion of the faculty member and used in exceptional circumstances; and may be based upon approved excused absences provided by the Center for Academic Success. Faculty may consider the grade of \"I\" petition when the following criteria have been met: The student has satisfactorily completed a minimum of 80% of the course requirements; and The student is passing the course; and The student is unable to complete the course during the term the course is offered. While these criteria must be met to consider an \"I\" grade, their fulfillment does not entitle students to receive an incomplete grade. The instructor of a course has the final decision regarding appropriate awarding of an \"I\" grade. To request an incomplete grade, the student is responsible for submitting to the Registrar's Office an approved \"Grade of Incomplete Petition\" form, which can be obtained from the Registrar's Office or the Center for Academic Success. To complete the form, a student must:Academic Policies | nunm.edu 156 Meet with the faculty member to complete the form and discuss the remaining course assignments to be submitted to change the incomplete grade; and Use the supplemental worksheet attached to the \"Grade of Incomplete Petition\" form to create a timeline for completion of course requirements; and Return the completed petition form to the Registrar's Office. When the student completes the work required to change the \"I\" grade, the faculty member will submit the \"Grade Change\" form to the Registrar's Office. A grade of incomplete should be completed within the first two (2) weeks of the next term, with an extension of no more than two (2) quarters. Failure to complete the required course work by the timeline on the contract will result in a failing grade. If a grade of \"I\" extends beyond two (2) quarters due to ongoing circumstances, the student may be required to take a leave of absence and will be allowed to complete the course material upon return from leave. Students who apply for a leave of absence and have not completed 80% of the coursework will receive a grade of \"W\" for the class, and will need to repeat it upon return from leave. A withdrawal will affect the student's ability to continue in certain course sequences in subsequent quarters. Multiple \"I\" grades in one quarter may result in the inability to petition for incomplete grades the subsequent quarter. A student requesting a grade of \"I\" in a course that is a prerequisite for a subsequent course may not enroll in the subsequent course until the grade of \"I\" is resolved or complete a petition to deviate, with faculty and dean approval. The program dean can deny registration for a student's final professional field experience (e.g., fieldwork, internship, capstone, etc.) if an \"I\" grade has not been resolved. Incomplete grades are not included when calculating GPA or total credits completed; however, \"I\" grades may affect a student's satisfactory academic progress. Students requesting \"I\" grades should meet with the Office of Financial Aid to examine the effects on their financial aid award. An incomplete will not be awarded when a student is failing a course for the purpose of giving additional time to complete late assignments. Any student who is failing a course after week eight (8) is not eligible to request an \"I.\" Grade of \"I\" - Graduate-Level Clinical Rotations A grade of \"I\" will be given to students who are passing a clinical rotation but have missed up to two (2) shifts (8 hours) during an 11- or 12-week term. Students must make up any missed shifts by the end of the following term in order to convert an \"I\" grade to a \"P.\" If missed shifts are not made up by the deadline, an \"I\" grade will convert to an \"F.\" See Sections 6 and 7 of the student handbook for more detail.Grade of \"CMP\"This grade (complete) is used for courses that the student is required to attend, but no evaluation is given. Examples of such courses include, but may not be limited to, ComEx, community education or new student orientation, for which the student is required to complete a certain number of hours. Grade of \"IP\" This grade designates a course is in progress; temporary grade. Once the faculty member submits the grades, the \"IP\" grade will be changed to the appropriate rating. Grade of \"W\" \"W\" (withdrawal) is a grade used to indicate that a student has withdrawn from a course. A \"W\" is recorded on a student's transcript but not included in GPA calculation. A \"W\" grade is, however, considered part of the courses attempted calculation as per the satisfactory academic progress policy. Remediation - Graduate Level Only Students who receive an \"R/FR\" are eligible to sit for remediation exams and/or projects. All remediation exams and/or projects must be completed and grade changes submitted to the Registrar's Office by the end of week two (2) of the following term (spring term grades have until week three of summer term). For students who receive an \"R/FR\" grade in spring quarter and have already made verifiable travel plans that interfere with this remediation schedule, they may, with the approval of the programmatic dean, be allowed to complete the remediation by the last week of the summer term. ND PROGRAM ND students who earn a 67-69% (\"D\" range or \"FR\" grade) in lecture courses are eligible to remediate a final exam. Labs and tutorial courses may offer remediation exams at instructor discretion, based on the course material and the feasibility of offering a remediation exam. If a remediation exam is available, an \"R\" grade will be listed on their transcript until a remediation exam has been taken and a permanent grade is entered into SONIS. In order to have the \"R\" grade as an option, faculty must include it in their syllabus. CCM PROGRAMS CCM students who earn a 60-69% (\"D\" range) for their final grade may be eligible to remediate a final exam if, in the judgment of the instructor, it is likely that the student could pass the course by successfully taking a remediation exam. An \"R\" or \"FR\" grade will be listed on their transcript until a remediation exam has been taken and a permanent grade is entered into SONIS. In order to have the \"R\" or \"FR\" grade as an option, faculty must include it in their syllabus.2018-2019 Course Catalog | A cademic Policies 157 SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES PROGRAMS School of Graduate Studies students who earn a 67-69% (\"D\" range) for their final grade may be eligible to remediate a final exam if, in the judgment of the instructor, it is likely that the student could pass the course by successfully taking a remediation exam. If a remediation exam is available, an \"R\" grade will be listed on their transcript until a remediation exam has been taken and a permanent grade is entered into SONIS. In order to have the \"R\" grade as an option, faculty must include it in their syllabus. Clinical Remediation Students who require extra support in meeting minimal levels of clinical competency are counseled and referred for additional instruction by their clinical supervisors or the program dean. ND CLINICAL SKILLS ENHANCEMENT TUTORIAL Clinical skills enhancement courses are generally scheduled over a six-week period of time; students may be referred to this course at any point during the term. The clinical skills enhancement instructor carefully assesses each student's abilities and works with them directly throughout the duration of the course. At the end of the course, the instructor reassesses the student's abilities and determines if the student should continue with the course. A faculty member may require or recommend a clinical skills enhancement course, even if a student receives a passing grade, if the faculty member feels the student needs additional help to remain on track in their clinical education. When an ND student receives two or more grades of \"Pass with Clinical Skills Enhancement Recommended\" during their academic career, the clinical skills enhancement course becomes a requirement and the student will be registered for it the next term. ND OBJECTIVE STRUCTURED CLINICAL EXAMINATION (OSCE) TUTORIAL An ND student who fails an OSCE exam twice will be referred to an OSCE skills tutorial for three sessions, and a failing grade will be recorded on their transcript. Upon successful completion of the OSCE tutorial, the student must then register to retake the OSCE exam. Any student who fails an OSCE exam three times is referred to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC). Students who fail the OSCE exam three times may be suspended. CCM CLINICAL SKILLS REMEDIATION Clinical evaluations of CCM student performance are done during week six (6) of the term to provide feedback and identify areas of weakness, including those that must be remediated before the end of term in order for the student to pass the clinic rotation. The clinical supervisor, in collaboration with the CCM associate dean of clinical education and the CCM dean, can assign remediation work, which can include attendance at weekly clinical skills tutorial labs run by a CCM resident. CCM CLINIC ENTRANCE EXAMINATION All CCM students take a practical point location examination at the beginning of the winter quarter prior to starting their internship year. Students failing this examination are given the opportunity to remediate this exam later in the same term. If the student fails the remediation exam, they must enroll in the Advanced Point Location course in the spring quarter. CCM students also take a written clinic entrance examination during the first half of the spring term prior to becoming an intern. The written examination covers the foundational course material needed to assume responsibility for direct patient care. Students who fail this examination are given the opportunity to remediate the exam later in the same term. A remediation fee is applied. Should a student fail the written examination for a second time, their entrance into the clinic is delayed for a term, during which the student will have time to address weak areas. Another written exam will be given toward the end of this term. Grade Appeals Students have the right to appeal a failing grade if they perceive that there has been an error in the grading procedure, or if there is a perceived lack of clarity about the faculty member's expectation for passing a course. The appeal must be made within two weeks of receipt of the grade. Grades of \"B\" or better cannot be appealed to receive a higher grade or a grade of \"honors.\" Academic Policies | nunm.edu 158 A student may request a review of a grade given in an exam or a final grade for a course only in the following manner: A written request by the student, for a review of the grade, must be submitted to the faculty member. This appeal must be within two weeks of the posted grade. The faculty member will advise the student in writing of the decision within seven days of receipt of the request. The student may appeal the faculty member's decision in writing via a \"Grade Appeal\" form. The completed appeal form will be submitted to the registrar. This appeal must be made within seven days of the faculty member's written notice to the student regarding the decision. The written appeal to the registrar must be accompanied by appropriate written documentation as to why the student feels the grade is in error, and what the outcome was of the discussion and appeal with the faculty member. The registrar will forward the appeal to the Academic Appeal and Review Committee (ARAC). ARAC will review the documentation, may have a discussion with the faculty member, and issue a recommendation to the program dean. The recommendations from ARAC may include upholding the grade as submitted or requiring the student to remediate an exam. ARAC may not recommend a passing grade to be substituted in place of a failing grade. The program dean will review the recommendations and make a final decision. The student and faculty member will be notified in writing of the final decision. The decision is final and may not be appealed to higher authority.ND OSCE Exam Appeals ND students who have a non-passing first OSCE exam result may not appeal, since a failing grade is not given until the second exam attempt is unsuccessful. A failed OSCE exam grade appeal must be submitted to the associate dean of clinical education within two (2) weeks of the posted grade, and will be referred to the Program and Student Assessment Committee for review. The committee will notify the student in writing of the decision within 14 days of receipt of the request. Academic Advising The Center for Academic Success (CAS) administers academic advising for all students. Students who are pursuing any track other than the standard published tracks must confer with CAS to ensure all requirements are met. Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress are required to meet with a CAS academic advisor. The Center for Academic Success and academic advisors are responsible for advising students on the following: Academic probation (meeting with students on academic probation) Changing tracks (four- to five-year, etc.) Leave of absences or withdrawing from a program or institution (voluntary or medical) Questions regarding concurrent track options Assistance with the grade appeals process General questions regarding academic progress and success 2018-2019 Course Catalog | A cademic Policies 159 Satisfactory Academic Progress - Doctorate Degree Programs Students must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward a degree in order to continue in the program and to continue to receive federal, state and institutional financial aid. Students must enroll in courses per published and/or approved curriculum layouts (unless on an approved deviated track). \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" is defined as: Passing grades in all academic courses and clinical rotations (for clinical students); and Passing all program requirements within one and one-half (1.5) times the length of the longest published enrolled program, generally between 5-7 years; and Maintaining a minimum number of 11 credits each term (excluding summer, unless applicable), unless on an approved deviated track. Students who earn a term GPA of less than 2.60, and have a cumulative GPA below 2.75, are considered not making satisfactory academic progress. Clinical students who receive two (2) or more failing grades in clinic rotations, or entrance/exit exams are considered not making satisfactory academic progress in a 12-month period. The Academic Progress Committee meets twice per academic term to determine students' academic progress. Students making unsatisfactory academic progress will be referred to the Academic Review and Appeals Committee (ARAC) as described in Section 7.10 of the student handbook. If a student is not making satisfactory academic progress in a course prior to the end of the term, the faculty member may request the student to access tutoring; and may share concerns with the program dean and/or director of academic success and access about classroom attendance, performance on examinations, and any other factors that may impact the student's success in the course. Financial aid recipients who fail to make satisfactory academic progress in any term will be subject to the terms and conditions outlined in the Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policies in place for that office (see Section 10.10 Criteria for Continued Student Eligibility in the student handbook). These policies are separate from NUNM's satisfactory academic progress policies. Students who have \"reached maximum timeframe status,\" as outlined in Section 10.13 of the student handbook, depending on the enrolled program, are considered not to be making satisfactory academic progress and will no longer be eligible for federal financial aid. Maintaining Active Enrollment for Satisfactory Academic Progress - Doctorate Degrees To maintain an active enrolled student status, a minimum enrollment of one credit is required. Any student who does not enroll in a minimum of one (1) credit each quarter will be considered withdrawn and must reapply, and will be subject to the graduation requirements in the catalog specific to the year of reapplication (this does not apply to standard summer breaks). Students who have met all course requirements but have outstanding graduation requirements such as a DSOM capstone, clinical hours, clinic proficiency objectives (CPOs), preceptor hours, or other graduation requirements must register for either one (1) credit of \"Thesis/Capstone Completion\" or one (1) credit of \"Graduation Completion\" each term until all graduation requirements are met. DSOM student have a maximum of one (1) academic year to complete their thesis/capstone. ND students have a maximum of two academic terms to finish all outstanding requirements. Students also must adhere to the maximum length of program requirement. Students are not eligible for financial aid while registered for a thesis/capstone or graduation completion credit. Failure to register each term for thesis/capstone/graduation completion credit will constitute a withdrawal. If a student wants to continue beyond the maximum length of program timeline, they will be required to meet with the director of academic success and access and their program dean to determine if they may continue at NUNM. The director of academic success and access and program dean will assess if the student can demonstrate knowledge retention and skills of their program. If it is determined that the student has gaps of knowledge Academic Policies | nunm.edu 160 and/or skills, the student will be required to complete additional academic and/or clinical work. Students who are granted an extension to continue their program beyond the maximum length of program deadline may then be matriculated under the university catalog of the year of their extended program, and are subject to the graduation requirements of their program listed in that catalog. Students will be required to sign an academic contract. Academic Standing - Doctorate Degrees The Registrar's Office monitors student GPAs (both term and cumulative) for academic standing and credit completion at the end of each term (including summer) to determine sufficient progress toward degree completion. The Registrar's Office will notify the student and the Center for Academic Success when the student is not making satisfactory academic progress. Students receiving financial aid should review the financial aid satisfactory academic progress requirements for continued eligibility in Section 10 of the NUNM student handbook. Incomplete grades are not calculated as a part of a student's GPA. Academic standing and insufficient credit completion are evaluated separately as described below. The following categories are used to describe a student's academic standing when unsatisfactory. ACADEMIC WARNING Academic warning status occurs when a student earns a term GPA of 2.95 and/or a cumulative GPA of 2.85. While on a warning status, a student is expected to meet with an academic advisor to develop a plan to address the concern. ACADEMIC PROBATION Academic probation occurs when a student earns a term GPA of below 2.75 and has a cumulative GPA below 2.80. Students are placed on academic probation when they earn: Two (2) or more grades of \"C,\" \"RC\" or lower in their academic career; or A failing grade of \"D\" or \"F,\" including clinical rotations; or Fall below full-time status for more than one term (unless on an approved deviated track). When placed on academic probation, a student must meet with an academic advisor in the Center for Academic Success to sign an academic contract within one week of notification. The academic contract will identify needed resources, including but not limited to remedial work, additional coursework, tutoring, or repeating course(s); and requires that the student improve their GPA and not fail any other courses during the probationary period.Students who fail to complete an academic contract will be withdrawn from any courses in which they are currently enrolled. Students are advised to meet with their university advisor(s) to discuss strategies for successful completion of their program. Students are removed from academic probation once they have earned a minimum term GPA of 2.80 and have a cumulative GPA of 2.85; any failed courses or clinic shifts are repeated and passed; and the terms of the academic contract are met. Students may not register or receive financial aid until a current academic contract is on file in the Registrar's Office. See Section 10.10 Criteria for Continued Student Eligibility for Financial Aid SAP policies in the student handbook. Students who fail to complete an academic contract within one week may be withdrawn from any courses in which they are currently enrolled and/or placed on registration hold.

Questions regarding this policy may be directed to the director of admissions, the program dean or dean of students. Reapplication and Readmission to NUNM - Undergraduate Policy Undergraduate students who have been academically suspended cannot submit an application for readmission to NUNM until the following criteria have been met: Demonstrated success of a minimum of 12 credits from an accredited college or university with a GPA of 2.50 or higher. (Submit transcript to the Office of Admissions); and Submission of a reapplication to the Office of Admissions.

Questions regarding this policy may be directed to the director of admissions, the program dean or dean of students. Honor Council The Honor Council is a standing committee composed of faculty, resident, student and staff representation. The committee meets monthly to review written complaints and performance reports referred from the dean of students that reflect failure of a student to maintain behavioral standards according to the Honor Code and Code of Conduct. Behavioral standards include, but are not limited to, honesty, respect, interpersonal skills, deportment and demeanor, learning skills, professional behavior and communication skills. The committee reviews reports that may be submitted by faculty, staff or students. The Honor Council, depending on the nature and severity of the report, may request a formal code of conduct investigation. The committee does not accept anonymous reports. After reviewing all information, students will meet with the committee to discuss reported problems. The committee makes recommendations to the dean of students, who then makes the final determination and notifies the student, in writing, of the outcome. The dean of students reviews all reports submitted for Honor Council review, and on occasion, may choose to expedite the process and make a determination without submitting the information to the Honor Council for review. If the Honor Council determines that the frequency of reports, an accumulation of non-academic violations, or the seriousness of a report demonstrates a problem, they may recommend a more severe sanction such as probation, suspension or expulsion, which may interfere with a student's ability to complete their academic program. Thereafter, any reports forwarded to the Honor Council may serve as a basis for the committee to recommend suspension. Meetings of the Honor Council are not legal proceedings. No attorneys may be present at any meeting of the committee. A student may bring a faculty member or a member of the Office of Student Life as an advisor or advocate. Advisors' sole purpose during the investigative process is supportive in nature. Advisors are not allowed to speak or otherwise participate in the proceeding or participate in the investigation. After reviewing a student file, the committee may recommend disciplinary sanctions that include, but are not limited to, any of the following sanctions to the dean of students: The student is found not in violation. No further action is required. A letter of reprimand or warning outlining policy, with a reminder to adhere to the policy or procedure. Referral for required areas of deficiency and remedial work may be required. This may include, but is not limited to, counseling, tutoring, meeting with an advisor or mentor, repeated course work, or restricted enrollment in certain courses. Restitution Community service or educational programming Disciplinary probation for behavioral reasons. The student does not currently demonstrate the appropriate behaviors, attitudes, skills or knowledge required for the program. A student placed on disciplinary probation for behavioral reasons may be required to perform remedial work, which may alter their course of study. In this case, any additional reports forwarded to the committee showing concern may result in suspension from the program. A recommendation for suspension or expulsion from NUNM. The committee may provide any additional recommendation it believes is suitable to address the issue at hand. Reports and letters outlining decisions made by the Honor Council and/or dean of students are maintained in the student's file in the program dean's office, and the Office of Student Life. Honor Code reports do not affect a student's academic record unless the outcome is suspension or expulsion from NUNM. Copies of reports and letters are maintained in compliance with NUNM's Record Retention Policy. 2018-2019 Course Catalog | A cademic Policies 169 Patient Safety Monitoring Board The purpose of the Patient Safety Monitoring Board (PSMB) is to apply a systematic, objective review process to adverse clinical events, and to provide formative feedback about clinical policies, procedures and educational practices with the goal of improving patient care and clinical quality. The PSMB serves as a subcommittee of the Honor Council. Once a student has been referred to the Honor Council for a clinical violation, the PSMB conducts a root cause analysis using the fishbone/cause and effect method to audit NUNM systems. The information is presented to the Honor Council, which deliberates as to whether there was a patient safety issue, as well as makes recommendations for prevention of future similar problems. Appeal of Honor Council Suspension or Expulsion Students have the right to appeal a suspension or expulsion from NUNM for Honor Code or Code of Conduct violations. Violations of a lesser nature may not be appealed. No adverse action will be taken against a student for registering an appeal in accordance with these policies. Within three (3) business days from the date disciplinary action was levied against the student by the dean of students, the student must notify the provost (or designee) of intention to appeal. The student will then have seven (7) calendar days to complete and submit to the provost (or designee) a written request for review. The provost (or designee) will respond with a final decision within ten (10) business days, not including weekends or published holidays, based on assessment of the information provided by the dean of students and the investigation of procedure, or refer the appeal to the Student Appeals Committee. In the unforeseen event the provost (or designee) needs additional time in reviewing the evidence, the provost (or designee) will notify the student in writing of the deadline extension. An appeal must contain the basis for the appeal limited to one or more of the following issues: Failure of the dean of students, or the Honor Council, to follow the procedures set forth in the policy in the student handbook. The sanction is grossly out of proportion/alignment with the offense. Information relevant to the decision that was not available to the committee for consideration at the time of the hearing. The provost (or designee) may elect to uphold the decision of the dean, reverse the decision, or request a different resolution. Examinations and Completion of Assignments Students are required to complete all examinations and assignments on schedule. An absence from an examination will generally be granted a grade of zero. Please note that NUNM does not accommodate a student's desire to take final examinations early due to travel arrangements or other reasons that are not outside of reasonable control. Students who miss an examination for reasons outside reasonable control will submit a MISSED EXAMINATION APPLICATION directly to the instructor or course coordinator in charge of the course within 24 hours. Faculty may approve or deny this request. If they approve, students will schedule their missed exam with the Center for Academic Success and follow steps as outlined on Moodle. There may be associated costs with make-up examinations. Students whose applications are denied will not be allowed to take a make-up examination-which may result in failure of the course. Students whose missed examination applications are denied may submit an appeal to their program dean (or designee) along with supporting documentation. The dean (or designee) may grant or deny this appeal at their discretion. If the appeal is granted, the student will be required to make up an equivalent examination. This examination will be equivalent in content but may be different in structure and style than the originally scheduled examination. Assignments submitted after the deadline will be graded according to the policy stated on the course syllabus. Students who believe they have a disability that inhibits their ability to complete examinations or assignments should contact the Center for Academic Success to discuss potential accommodations.

Voluntary Leave of Absence/Withdraw Students considering a leave of absence or withdrawing from a program/university must schedule an appointment with the Center for Academic Success. A student in good standing (i.e., has no outstanding grades of incomplete, failed remediate or failure for required courses, and is not on academic or disciplinary probation) and who has satisfied all financial obligations to NUNM, may apply for a leave of absence of up to, and not more than, 180 days. Students in need of more than 180 days, or whose curriculum layout would dictate the need for more than 180 days, may be eligible for a temporary withdraw for up to, and no more than, one academic year (four academic quarters\u2014regardless of enrollment of summer term), provided there is space in the class. Students taking less than a full academic year off may not be allowed to continue with a full class load due to the sequencing of courses and prerequisites. In such instances, the student may be required to enter a new educational track that must be approved by the Center for Academic Success or program dean. The program deans and/or academic advisor can guide students through a new schedule. Students who take a leave of absence or withdraw during the course will earn a grade of \"W.\" If the student withdraws with 80% or more completion of the course, the student may be eligible to petition the faculty member for an incomplete grade. See the Incomplete policy under Section 5.8. in the student handbook. Students who are on a leave of absence or withdrawn cannot participate in any academic activities, including remediating incomplete grades or exams, and/or participating in clinical rotation shifts, including preceptor rotations. Concurrently enrolled students may take a leave/withdraw from their secondary program without taking a leave from their primary program. However, concurrently enrolled students who take a leave of absence or withdraw from their primary degree program must also take a leave of absence or withdraw from their secondary program. The Center for Academic Success must be advised of a student's intention to return to NUNM within 30 days of intended return, and before the beginning of the quarter for which the student plans to register. The Center for Academic Success will instruct the student to fill out and submit a \"Returning Student Notification\" form to be approved by the following offices: Registrar, Financial Aid, 2018-2019 Course Catalog | A cademic Policies 171 and Center for Academic Success. The form should be returned to the Registrar's Office when it is completed. If a student does not return within one year, the student will be considered administratively withdrawn from the program and will be required to submit a new application for admission. The student will need to satisfy admission requirements in effect at the time of reapplication, but may request that the application fee be waived. A leave of absence normally will be granted to any student who is in good standing (i.e., has no outstanding grades of incomplete, fail remediate or failure for required courses, and is not on academic or disciplinary probation), and who has satisfied all financial obligations to NUNM. Students are not allowed to take more than one year (four quarters) of absence from NUNM during their academic career. Medical Leave of Absence/Withdraw Students considering a medical leave of absence/withdraw must schedule an appointment with the Center for Academic Success. In the case of a medical leave of absence/withdraw, which may be granted to a student on academic probation, appropriate documentation is required from the attending physician. The physician must indicate the necessity of granting the leave. A student who is not in good academic standing (i.e., has outstanding grades of incomplete, failed remediate or failure for required courses, or is on academic or disciplinary probation) and who has satisfied all financial obligations to NUNM, may apply for a medical leave of absence/withdraw of up to, and not more than, one academic year (four academic terms), which entitles the student to re-enter NUNM during the predetermined term the following academic year, provided there is space in the class and the student has provided medical documentation stating the student is fit to return to classes.

Students who take a leave of absence/withdraw during the course of a term will earn a grade of \"W.\" If the student withdraws with 80% or more completion of the course, the student may be eligible to petition the faculty member for an incomplete grade. Concurrently enrolled students may take a leave from their secondary program without taking a leave from their primary program. However, concurrently enrolled students who take a leave of absence or withdraw from their primary degree program may be required to take a leave of absence or withdraw from their secondary program. Students who are on a medical leave of absence/withdraw cannot participate in any academic activities, including remediating incomplete grades or exams; and/or participating in clinical rotation shifts, including preceptor rotations. A student who wishes to return from a medical leave of absence/withdraw must provide to the Center for Academic Success adequate documentation from the attending physician demonstrating the student's fitness for returning to the program. After documentation has been reviewed and approved, the registrar will be advised of the student's intention to return to NUNM. The advisement of a student's intention to return must be given within 30 days of intended return, and before the beginning of the quarter for which the student plans to register. The Center for Academic Success will instruct the student to fill out and submit a \"Returning Student Notification\" form to the following offices: Registrar, Financial Aid, and Center for Academic Success. The form should be returned to the Registrar's Office when it is completed. Students taking less than a full academic year off may not be allowed to continue with a full class load due to sequential courses and missing prerequisites. In such instances, the student may be required to enter a new educational track, which must be approved by the Center Academic Policies | n unm.edu 172 for Academic Success or program dean. The program dean and/or academic advisor can guide students through a new schedule. If a student on a medical leave of absence/withdraw does not return within one year, the student will be considered administratively withdrawn from NUNM and will be required to submit a new application for admission. Any incomplete grades will be converted to a failing grade. The student will need to satisfy admission requirements in effect at the time of reapplication, but may request that the application fee be waived. A student who is not in good academic standing (i.e., has outstanding grades of incomplete, failed remediate or failure for required courses, or is on academic or disciplinary probation) and is serving in the military will be granted a medical leave of absence/withdraw without medical documentation. The student must submit documentation of their time serving from the military branch. Students are not allowed to take more than one year (four terms) of absence from NUNM during their academic career. Concurrent Student Leave of Absence Students are only allowed to be enrolled in two (2) programs concurrently. Concurrently enrolled students are not required to take a leave from both programs at the same time, allowing them to remain in one program while on leave from the other program. However, concurrent students who take a leave of absence or withdraw from their primary degree program must also take a leave of absence or withdraw from their second program. In the case of a leave of absence, students are assured a seat in both programs upon return to NUNM. Any exception to this policy must be petitioned to the dean of students (or designee) and is subject to the conditions outlined below. For concurrent students who choose to take a leave of absence or withdraw from their primary program, and wish to continue the series of courses in their secondary program for the remainder of the academic year, the following conditions apply: There is not an option of continuing in their secondary degree program at a full-time status, nor returning early from the leave of absence to the primary program. Concurrent students who elect to continue in their secondary degree program while on a leave of absence from their primary program are not eligible for Title IV financial aid. Students may be reviewed for aid eligibility in the next academic year. Concurrent students cannot add core courses in their secondary program until the next matriculation start date. This policy may not apply to students with an MSiMR secondary-degree program. Involuntary Leave of Absence This policy is designed to maintain the health and safety of all campus community members. A student may be restricted from campus or subject to an involuntary leave of absence, when, due to a mental, emotional, physical or psychological health disorder, their continued presence at the university poses a significant risk of substantial harm to themselves or others, or is creating a substantial disruption to the educational environment. A significant risk is based upon an individualized assessment and constitutes a high probability of substantial harm that cannot be mitigated by reasonable means. In most situations where a student's medical, psychiatric or psychological condition poses a threat to themselves or to others, the student will be highly encouraged by the dean of students to voluntarily accept a leave of absence (LOA) or medical leave of absence (MLOA). However, if the student does not take such a voluntary leave, the involuntary leave of absence (ILOA) process may commence. If a student has taken actions that are identified as being a significant risk to the health or safety of oneself or other(s), or is creating a substantial disruption to the educational environment, the dean of students or designee, 2018-2019 Course Catalog | A cademic Policies 173 acting on behalf of NUNM and in consultation with the Crisis Assessment and REsponse Team (CARE Team), may initiate the ILOA process as set forth below. The significant risks may include, but are not limited to, acute danger/loss of life, inability to independently manage daily tasks, or inability to cooperate with necessary support services, etc. If the decision is made to place the student on an ILOA, the student is prohibited from participating in any academic or non-academic NUNM activities, including remediating incomplete grades or exams, and/or participating in clinical and preceptor rotations. The student may be subjected to actions including, but not limited to: A temporary ban from campus Withdrawal from class attendance or experiential learning (i.e., preceptor rotations, community education, university-sponsored travel, etc.) An interim suspension of participation in any campus or off-campus NUNM activities; and/or Completion of a mental health, substance abuse, or other necessary evaluation conducted by an appropriate off-campus licensed health provider Students will receive a written description of the details of the ILOA pertaining to them, including the appeal procedures as outlined in Section 14 of the student handbook. The letter regarding the ILOA will be placed in the student's file with a copy sent to the program dean(s), director of academic success and access, registrar, director of financial aid, and the provost. The Registrar's Office will notify course instructors of the student's leave status. A student who wishes to return from an ILOA must provide to the dean of students (or designee) adequate documentation, as outlined in the initial letter, from the attending physician or mental health professional demonstrating the student's fitness for returning to NUNM. Students taking less than a full academic year off may find, upon their return, that the appropriate course load required to stay on track will not qualify them for full-time financial aid. In such instances, the student may be required to enter a new educational track, which must be approved by an academic advisor. Students who take an ILOA will earn a grade of \"W\" for all enrolled courses at the time the leave is instated. If the student has completed at least 80% of the course at the time of the withdrawal, they may be eligible to petition the faculty member for a grade of \"incomplete.\" Withdrawal from School Students may initiate formal withdrawal by meeting with the Center for Academic Success. Students withdrawing from school at any time during the school year must complete an exit interview with the Office of Financial Aid and submit a completed \"Leave Withdrawal\" form available from the Center for Academic Success. Failure to register for any quarter is considered a withdrawal, and the student will need to submit a new application and application fee for readmission. Students who withdraw from NUNM during the course of a term will earn a grade of \"W.\" A student facing an alleged violation of the Code of Conduct or Honor Code may not be permitted to withdraw from NUNM until all allegations are resolved. A student required to attend an ARAC meeting may not be permitted to withdraw or take a leave of absence from NUNM until they have resolved the referral to the committee. If a leave of absence or withdraw is granted prior to resolution of institutional processes, the student will be required to attend ARAC prior to returning from leave/withdraw. Withdrawals - Federal Title IV Aid Recipients If a student ceases attendance (drops or withdraws) from all Title IV eligible courses in a payment period or a period of enrollment, the student is considered withdrawn for Federal Title IV aid purposes. Federal Loan Exit Interviews Federal regulations require that any student who has received a federal loan while attending NUNM and who leaves for any reason, including official leaves of absence, must participate in a loan exit interview. Exit interviews are conducted online at studentloans.gov. Additional information may be obtained by calling the Financial Aid Office. Independent Study Independent study is offered only when specific, approved circumstances require the student to achieve the course competencies outside of the normal classroom venue. This could happen, for example, when there is an unavoidable scheduling conflict for a student on an approved non-standard track. To accomplish an independent study, the student must: 1. Complete the \"Independent Study\" form, which includes getting approval from the program dean and the course instructor, and having the course instructor define how the course competencies will be achieved 2. File the form with the Registrar's Office prior to the start of the term 3. Pay any requisite fees 4. Complete all course requirements within the normal term, or register for a second quarter (tuition required)Academic Policies | n unm.edu 174 Independent study is not allowed for elective courses when the student has completed the elective requirement for their program. Conduct and Professional Standards NUNM expects all students to maintain professional standards of conduct and appearance. These standards are found in the academic and nonacademic policies and procedures section of the student handbook, and in the clinic section and honor code. The naturopathic oath, classical Chinese medicine oath, state laws and regulations, and documents of professional organizations such as the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) and American Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (AAAOM) provide further insight concerning professional standards of conduct. The student conduct code in the student handbook specifies procedures for investigating violations of university policies and the sanctions that may be imposed. Academic Freedom NUNM faculty and students are free to question, discover and test all knowledge appropriate to their discipline as judged by the academic community in general. Student Records The Registrar's Office maintains permanent academic records of each student enrolled at NUNM. Unless otherwise required by law or special circumstances, the university will follow the policies set forth in this section and the record retention policy found in the student handbook. Typically, a student's academic record contains an application file, personal information necessary for NUNM business, grade reports, and records of any official action by NUNM concerning the student. Students are notified annually via email of their rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) - commonly referred to as the \"Buckley Amendment.\" The Business Office, Financial Aid Office, Office of Student Life, and Academic Affairs Office may also maintain student files as required by their respective functions. NUNM will maintain information on students in a secure, confidential manner in accordance with FERPA, and to that end will observe the following guidelines: University officers and faculty may review student records on an as-needed basis. NUNM holds the following information as directory information, which may be disclosed in response to legitimate requests: name, address, telephone number, university email address, dates of attendance, enrollment status (full time, part time and leave of absence), academic program, graduation date, photograph and awards received. NUNM will only print the following information in directories: name, year in school, university email and telephone number. Personal information about students will not be shared with third parties on- or off-campus, except as directed in writing by the student, the courts or governmental agencies. A student who wishes to review their records may do so by submitting a request in writing 48 hours prior to the time they wish to view their records. A student may not make copies of documents in their files. A student who believes information contained in their academic record is inaccurate, misleading, or a violation of privacy may request that the records be amended. In the event of a disagreement between a student and the administration as to the disposition of an issue, the student has the right to place a personal position statement in their academic file. A student has the right to file complaints with the appropriate agencies concerning alleged failures by NUNM to comply with applicable laws and rules, and/or their implementing regulations. Students may request information to be withheld by completing a \"Directory Hold Request\" form available from the Registrar's Office. NUNM may, in accordance with FERPA, disclose personally identifiable information from a student's education record without consent if the disclosure is in connection with a health or safety emergency. Each student is responsible for furnishing, completely and accurately, all information required by NUNM so that it may perform its proper function as an educational 2018-2019 Course Catalog | A cademic Policies 175 institution. If a student's circumstances change (e.g., name, address, financial situation, etc.), the student is responsible to ensure that appropriate university officials are informed of the changed circumstance as soon as possible. No part of a student's file, except directory information as noted above, will be released to any person outside of NUNM without written consent of the student, except as required by law. Records for students attending NUNM under the provisions of the Veterans Administration will be accessible to certain authorized state and federal personnel without prior consent in accordance with 45 CFR, part 99.31 and part 99.35. FERPA does not apply to employment situations, nor does it apply to candidates for matriculation to NUNM. However, Human Resources and the Office of Admissions adhere strictly to guidelines of professional conduct. All student admission applicant and employee applicant records are the property of NUNM and will not be released or returned except as outlined above. Change of Track Students are admitted to a specific program (see catalog for listing of available tracks) and are required to follow their educational track. Within a track, students are not allowed to drop required courses or take required courses ahead of schedule. After matriculation, students may request to change tracks to any of the standard educational tracks by submitting a \"Track Change\" form, approved by an academic advisor, to the Registrar's Office. Once processed by the Registrar's Office, students must follow their new educational track. All track requests must be completed by week eight of the quarter prior to the quarter in which the change takes effect. Due to the timing of some deviations or track changes, a student may lose their full-time status. Adjustments to individual tracks may be required due to course conflicts. Students who deviate from their approved educational track may be required to take a leave of absence or fall under a new course catalog curriculum. Deviation Students are admitted to a specific program (see catalog for listing of available tracks) and are required to follow their educational track. Within a track, students are not allowed to drop required courses or take required courses ahead of schedule. Students may deviate from the standard educational tracks for the following reasons: 1. Approved and documented disability accommodation 2. Leave of absence/withdrawal 3. Transfer credits4. Failure of a required course 5. Adding a second program 6. Conflicts of required courses Students seeking to deviate from their standard educational track are required to meet with the Center for Academic Success to discuss options and approval. Deviation requests must be accompanied by the appropriate documentation before approval can be given. A track change also requires a signature from the Financial Aid Office, since there is likelihood of award modification to the student. Due to the timing of some deviations or track changes, a student may fall from full-time status. Adjustments to individual tracks may be required due to course conflicts. Students approved for deviations must maintain institutional and financial aid Satisfactory Academic Progress within their program(s). Change/Addition of Degree(s) Students who wish to withdraw from one degree program and enroll into another must formally apply through the Center for Academic Success before applying through the Office of Admissions. Once admitted, an academic advisor will work with the program dean to approve and inform the student regarding potential transfer credit, challenge exam options, and establish a new track. Students must meet with the Office of Financial Aid, since there is likelihood of award modification to the student. Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress in their original program may not be aid eligible for their new program. Students who wish to add an additional degree (i.e., become a concurrently enrolled student in two degree programs) must formally apply through the Office of Admissions. Once admitted, the student will work with the Center for Academic Success to establish a new track. Students must meet with the Office of Financial Aid, since there is likelihood of award modification. Students may pursue no more than two degrees concurrently. See the Financial Policies section for information on fees. Students who matriculate into a second degree program will do so under the catalog corresponding to the year in which the student begins the new degree. Adding/Dropping Academic Courses Students self-register for all core courses and may not deviate from the established curriculum unless they have submitted and received approval via a \"Petition to Deviate from Current Policy or Requirements\" form. During week one (1) of each quarter, students may change sections in courses for which this is applicable. During this same period, they may also register for elective courses, Academic Policies | n unm.edu 176 and must submit an \"Add/Drop\" form with proper signatures to the Registrar's Office.

Lab and retreat fees are non-refundable once the term begins, even when the course occurs later in the term. Adding/Dropping Clinic Rotations To add or drop a clinical rotation, students must contact the associate registrar. Students have a three- to five-day period after the clinic assignment schedule has been posted to make any changes to their clinic schedule (add or drop rotations) without being charged. This period is known as the \"clinic adjustment period.\" The final deadline date to make changes is indicated on the clinic schedules. A $50 add/drop/switch fee will be charged for any rotation changes after the final deadline. Students who request any changes in their clinic rotations after the deadline must fill out a \"Petition to Deviate from Current Policy or Requirements\" form and submit it for approval to the Center for Academic Success, which will then notify the student of the decision in writing. If denied, the student may appeal the decision to the program dean. The student will be notified of the decision by the associate registrar. Students are responsible for attending their current clinic shifts until decisions are finalized. All fees concerning clinic rotations will apply.
