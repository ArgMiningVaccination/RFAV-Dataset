I loved my time at Soul Surgery! I was in the program for about 5 months and my life completely changed for the better. I battled my addiction, and learned new coping skills and ways to handle tough situations and make the right decision. From the start everyone was super helpful and caring. Staff knows you by name and no one ever judges you either which is nice. I'm grateful for the time I was there and would highly recommend to anyone! Thanks Soul Surgery! Chad V.
