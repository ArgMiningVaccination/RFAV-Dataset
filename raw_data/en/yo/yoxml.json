Excludes gift vouchers Question:Hi There, I have a new friend that has MS. What stones are good for supporting her? Thanks, J Answer: Hi J, Thank you for reaching out to us. Crystals I can Recommend for Multiple Sclerosis*: [Jade](https://www.healingcrystals.com/support/scp/l.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.healingcrystals.com%2Fproducts-by-jade-stone.html%3Fsort_view%3Dstone&auth=93272d6ce6be288e569f03d01e085d75) can be helpful in strengthening the immune system but it is a very good crystal for general healing of many ailments or dis-ease. [Aragonite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/support/scp/l.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healingcrystals.com%2Fproducts-by-aragonite-stone.html%3Fsort_view%3Dstone&auth=93272d6ce6be288e569f03d01e085d75) can also help to strengthen the immune system and regulate processes that are proceeding too fast. [Hematite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/support/scp/l.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.healingcrystals.com%2Fproducts-by-hematite-stone.html%3Fsort_view%3Dstone&auth=93272d6ce6be288e569f03d01e085d75), as well as [Clear Quartz](https://www.healingcrystals.com/support/scp/l.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healingcrystals.com%2Fproducts-by-clear%2520quartz-stone.html%3Fsort_view%3Dstone&auth=93272d6ce6be288e569f03d01e085d75), are also recommended and can be helpful in supporting healing from MS. Depending on her specific symptoms, she can also get crystals to assist with those*: [Red Jasper](https://www.healingcrystals.com/support/scp/l.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healingcrystals.com%2Fproducts-by-red%2520jasper-stone.html%3Fsort_view%3Dstone&auth=93272d6ce6be288e569f03d01e085d75) can help to boost energy and vitality as weakness and fatigue is a symptom associated with MS. [Ametrine](https://www.healingcrystals.com/support/scp/l.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healingcrystals.com%2Fproducts-by-ametrine-stone.html%3Fsort_view%3Dstone&auth=93272d6ce6be288e569f03d01e085d75) can help regenerate the physical body and strengthen the immune system. Symptoms of MS can include double vision, and Ametrine can also support with that. [Sunstone](https://www.healingcrystals.com/support/scp/l.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healingcrystals.com%2Fproducts-by-sunstone-stone.html%3Fsort_view%3Dstone&auth=93272d6ce6be288e569f03d01e085d75) also comes to mind and that would also assist in boosting her energy. It was the first crystal that came to my mind when I was reading your message. [Rhodonite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/support/scp/l.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healingcrystals.com%2Fproducts-by-rhodonite-stone.html%3Fsort_view%3Dstone&auth=93272d6ce6be288e569f03d01e085d75) can help with treatment of Multiple Sclerosis. It's also a very nurturing but balancing and grounding crystal. [Topaz](https://www.healingcrystals.com/support/scp/l.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healingcrystals.com%2Fproducts-by-topaz-stone.html%3Fsort_view%3Dstone&auth=93272d6ce6be288e569f03d01e085d75) can help fortify nerves. What I would recommend is to show her the crystals recommended and see which stand out to her. Those would be the best for her healing at this current time because she resonates with them. If you are unable to do that, keep her in mind while you're looking at the recommendations and see which keep drawing you back to them. You can then make her a little [medicine bag](https://www.healingcrystals.com/support/scp/l.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.healingcrystals.com%2FWhat_s_In_Your_Bag___The_Medicine_Bag__Articles_6297.html&auth=93272d6ce6be288e569f03d01e085d75) with those chosen crystals and she can wear that or keep it with her. Don't forget to include a little intention for her, e.g. abundance of healing and strengthening of her central nervous system and protection for her nerves. Don't forget to [clear your crystals](https://www.healingcrystals.com/Clearing_Crystals_and_How_to_Clear_Crystals_Articles_17753.html) of energetic build-up after purchase as well as on a regular basis. I hope this helps a bit :) Don't forget to have a crystalicious day further! -Siobhan Gouws * Disclaimer: I am not a doctor and cannot give medical advice.

On top of that hill was an enormous Rhodonite formation of a giant arrow that pointed southwest. I used to sit on the arrow head to meditate! Time to get another piece! Thank you for this article!
