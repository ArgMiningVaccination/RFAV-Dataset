Dr. Chang-Cheng Chang, the director of the Cosmetic Medical Center of the affiliated hospital of China Medical University pointed out that Asians have some skin features, about 30% of the patients is \"Melasma\", not only the spot problem, those patients are often combined with photo-damaged thin skin, sensitive redness and other phenomenon. Thus, many patient encounter post-laser pigmentation, and traditional laser cannot effectively promote. \"The key of the problem is that conventional laser treatment only focuses on destruction but not reconstructing the thickness of the skin.\" Dr. Chang-Cheng Chang, the director of the Cosmetic Medical Center said that the traditional laser spotting treatment only removes the spots and melanin by heat, and doctors often hit the black spots directly with bleedings and crusts. The patient needs a few weeks of recovery. The skin may be thinner and thinner by having too frequent treatments, not only sensitive, but also prone to anti-black, white spots, uneven pigment or recurrence and other issues. The 755-wavelength pico laser can not only remove spots, but with focus lens array, 70% of the energy can be concentrated. Therefore, the effects for depigmentation is even better. \"Pico\" means the unit of ten seconds of the twelfth power of twelve seconds, due to the thermal effect of a very short time, thermal damage is also small, anti-black probability naturally significantly reduced; In addition, the laser itself does not damage epidermis and dermis. The risk of subcutaneous bleeding is minimal. After treatment, the skin will almost not appear ugly bleeding point due to less harm. The post-laser pigmentation is minimal. The laser induced optical breakdown can make the collagen increase to restore the thickness of skin against UV light. Thus, the melanin will not be over- produced, and the color of skin will gradually whiten with minimal photosensitive allergy and inflammatation. According to the literature periodical report, at present, only the \"Focus lens array\" combined with the 755 nm wavelength pico laser can stimulate newborn collagen, reconstruct the thickness of the skin and maintain the skin without damaging the basal cells of the skin without causing obvious inflammation of the skin as well as reduce skin aging. Under the assessment of a professional physician is a new weapon of comprehensive improvement of the skin problems, such as pigmentation, fine wrinkles, dimpling texture, and acne scar. Director Chang believes that in addition to remove the spots successfully, patients must get correct diagnosis and follow-up maintenance of skin care. For example, at the beginning, there may still be an adaptation period of itching and redness. If some patients neglect sun protection or continue to smoke, they may easily relapse. However, along with proper education and health tracking can they have better and more lasting effects.
