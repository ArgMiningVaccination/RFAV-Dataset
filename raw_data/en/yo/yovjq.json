Vitamin Recommendations: Prenatal vitamins are recommended during pregnancy. There is no known ideal formula for a prenatal vitamin, but any FDA regulated prenatal vitamin is likely to be helpful. Pregnant women should have the following each day through diet or supplements: - Folic acid 400-800 micrograms (until the end of the first trimester). If there is a family history of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, or a family history of cleft lips or palates, it is recommended to take 4 mg of folic acid daily. - Vitamin D 600 international units - Calcium 1,000 mg DON'T take any supplemental Vitamin A or skin preparations with Retin-A. Caffeine: Limit it to less than 2 cups of coffee, tea, soda or other caffeinated beverages per day. Smoking, Nicotine and Vaping: People should not smoke cigarettes during pregnancy. If you are not able to quit entirely, reduce use as much as possible. It has been proven that smoking increases risk of miscarriages, preterm labor , placental problems and low birth weight newborns. Nicotine replacement (with patches or gum) is appropriate as part of a smoking cessation strategy. Avoid vaping devices, they may deliver higher amounts of nicotine than patches or gum. For further information about quitting smoking: nysmokefree.com or call 1-866-NY-QUITS (1-866-697-8487).

Please speak with your provider . We want to do everything we can to help you make healthy decisions. Marijuana: There is little data regarding long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of marijuana use in pregnancy; therefore, marijuana use is currently not recommended in pregnancy or when breastfeeding. CBD: Cannabidiol (CBD) may contain small amounts of THC (the hallucinogenic component of marijuana). There is no data to support the use of CBD in pregnancy. Opioids: Whether they are prescribed or not prescribed, PLEASE SPEAK WITH YOUR PROVIDER.9 Stony Brook MedicineWeight Gain in Pregnancy On average, people gain between 25-35 pounds during pregnancy.
