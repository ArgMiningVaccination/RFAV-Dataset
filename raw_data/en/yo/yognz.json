This is a very unique place\u2014one that balances on the twin foundations of Faith and Science. Being a student here will expose you to a group of faculty and staff who have chosen to be part of this experience we call Loma Linda. They have chosen to work here because they share in the belief that this is a special place. We emphasize what we call mission-focused learning. This means that what we offer centers on more than producing knowledgeable profession - als, because we believe that who you are is even more important than what you know. To assist in this lifelong process, we are encouraging the en - culturation of our seven core values, known by the acronym of JCHIEFS. These are Justice, Compas - sion, Humility, Integrity, Excellence, Freedom, and Self-Control/Purity. I encourage each of you to search your own heart and find ways to strength - en these virtues in everything you do. You also will find an incredible mixture of cultural diversity on our campus. Revel in our differences, and use each exposure to help you un - derstand the issues that separate us. With under - standing comes acceptance. And with acceptance come peace and fellowship. So use your time at Loma Linda to seek out those from other countries and cultures from whom you can learn and gain greater understanding. We will all be better as we tear down those barriers that often separate us. All this uniqueness is centered on the profound belief that God is here, active in the lives and ex - periences of each of us. Through our weekly Cam - pus Worship, the prayers of faculty in class, and the daily interchanges across campus, I invite you to join me in getting to know Him better. Place your future in His hands. Have confidence in His leading. Seek out opportunities to fellowship and grow in His love. Thank you for joining our campus family. I hope it will become as special to you as it has for so many of our 42,000 alumni. Cordially yours, Richard H. Hart, M.D., Dr.P .H.

Affirmative Action The University routinely monitors its educational and employment practices regarding women, minorities, and the disabled to ensure compliance with the law and University policy. The Univer - sity's affirmative action policy is to provide equal access to admissions, educational programs and activities, financial aid, student services, and employment. In compliance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Reha - bilitation Act of 1973, a grievance procedure has been established to process student complaints alleging violation of these regulations or of the University's policy of nondiscrimination based on gender or disability. Inquiries concerning Title IX may be directed to the affirmative action officer. Employment-related discrimination complaints, including those filed by student employees, are processed in conformity with the provisions outlined in existing staff personnel policies. Com - plaints related to discrimination in academic areas are reviewed in conformity with the procedures established by the academic administration. Accommodation for Disability 9 Accommodation for Disability Loma Linda University is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as well as with local and state requirements. The University is committed to providing education\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified applicants for whom such accommo - dation does not fundamentally alter the chosen program or create an undue burden. For information regarding accommodation for disability, the student should consult the office of the dean of the school to which application for admission is being made. Following acceptance, the student may be asked if he or she has a disability requiring accommoda - tion. A student who desires accommodation for a disability (e.g., physical, learning, or psychologi - cal) identified after acceptance should consult the office of the dean regarding a request for accom - modation. The accommodation request must be submitted in writing on the designated form. The completed form and the required supporting documentation will be evaluated by appropriate University entities to determine whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the es - sential functions of the program. All discussions will remain confidential. Nondiscrimination Policy Loma Linda University was established by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as an integral part of its teaching ministry. The University affirms that Christian principles are incompatible with various forms of discrimination that have divided societies, and that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and should be so regarded by all His people. Therefore, the University is com - mitted to equal education and employment oppor - tunities for men and women of all races; and does not discriminate on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national origin in its educational or admissions policies, financial affairs, employ - ment programs, student life and services, or any University-administered program. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended; and is in substantial compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Adjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employees or applicants for employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled veterans or veterans of the Viet - nam era. In addition, the University administers student programs without discrimination on the basis of age\u2014except in those programs where age is a bona fide academic qualification for admis - sion\u2014in accordance with the provisions of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The University reserves constitutional and statu - tory rights as a religious institution and employer to give preference to Seventh-day Adventists in admissions and employment, including but not limited to 42 U.S.C. Secs. 2000e-1, 2000e-2; Sec. 6-15 of Sec. 12926 (d)(1); Title II, Division 4, Chapter 2, Sec. 7286.5 of the California Code of Regulations; the First Amend - ment to the United States Constitution; and Article 1, Sec. 4, of the California Constitution. The University believes that Title IX regulations are subject to constitutional guarantees against unreasonable entanglement with or infringements on the religious teachings and practices of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The University expects students and employees to uphold biblical principles of morality and deportment as inter - preted by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The University claims exemptions from the provisions of Title IX set forth in CATALOG 2010 January S M T W T F S 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31

A Seventh-day Adventist health sciences institution20 UNIVERSITY CATALOG University Philosophy As implied by its motto, \"TO MAKE MAN WHOLE,\" the University affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe.Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. \"Wholeness means the lifelong, harmonious de - velopment of the physical, intellectual, emotional, relational, cultural and spiritual dimensions of a person's life, unified through a loving relationship with God and expressed in generous service to others.\" Quoted in \"The Grace of Wholeness\" by Gerald R. Winslow, Ph.D., SCOPE , Spring 1999. Also quoted as the adopted definition of wholeness in the Loma Linda University Wholeness Inventory. Core Values The University affirms these values as central to its view of education: COMPASSION\u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and sufferings of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which Loma Linda University has taken as a central symbol of its work. INTEGRITY\u2014The quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are well-considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. EXCELLENCE\u2014The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. FREEDOM\u2014The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery but to freedom. JUSTICE\u2014The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could be genuine only when it led the believers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" PURITY /SELF-CONTROL\u2014The commitment to be morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control over one's emotions, de - sires, and actions. HUMILITY\u2014The willingness to serve others in a sacrificial manner, and the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance. Student Learning Outcomes Loma Linda University's student learning out - comes are in the process of being implemented throughout all degree programs within the Uni - versity. The Office of Assessment and Institutional Learning is working with programs to guide the assessment of these outcomes. All degree pro - grams have articulated their learning outcomes, which will also reflect the University's value of educational effectiveness. oUtCome 1 Students understand and apply the University philosophy of wholeness in their personal and professional lives. oUtCome 2 Students understand the importance of integrat - ing the University's Christ-centered values in their personal and professional lives. oUtCome 3 Students demonstrate critical thinking. University Mace, Coat of Arms, and Seal 21 oUtCome 4 Students develop a commitment to discovery and lifelong learning. oUtCome 5 Students demonstrate effective communication skills in English. oUtCome 6 Students demonstrate effective use of technology appropriate to the discipline. oUtCome 7 Students understand the importance of embrac - ing and serving a diverse world. oUtCome 8 Students demonstrate the importance of collabo - rating with others within and across disciplines. University Mace, Coat of Arms, and Seal Traditionally the ceremonial mace represents the authority vested in the highest officer of a governing body. In an educational institution, the authority symbolized by the mace derives from respect for the authority of knowledge and for the rights and value of the individual. Thus the leader of an academic community assumes the obligation and challenge to ensure for its members a climate conducive to growth in knowledge and grace. The construction of the ceremonial mace of Loma Linda University evokes further ideas. Its two metals, bronze and aluminum, suggest the value of lessons both ancient and contemporary. Rather than lying prone, an instrument to be wielded, this mace stands upright in celebration of the human spirit. Its open construction implies free exposure to questions, ideas, and conflict. The eight vertical supporting elements (at three points bound together as for strength and stability in unity) uphold a graceful oval that points outward to the universe, the province of inquiry. Within the oval, the University seal appears to float unfettered. The basic design of the coat of arms and the seal of Loma Linda University\u2014es - tablished in 1905 as the College of Medical Evan - gelists\u2014is a contemporary modification of the shield, a heraldic device. Within the seal, the Christian cross\u2014a universal symbol\u2014acknowledges the role of Jesus Christ as Savior and Redeemer. The lighted torch\u2014part of our logo since 1959\u2014 suggests the illuminating power of knowledge and the central role of the Holy Spirit in teaching and healing. It also references the institution's call to serve as a light to the world. The ancient staff of Aesculapius, long associated with medicine\u2014and part of our logo since the 1920s\u2014represents in the modern and broad sense the combined services of all the healing arts and sciences. Across the base of the shield, the open book sym - bolizes the Word of God\u2014the foundation of all truth, the source of the Christ-centered commis - sion, the inspiration for all endeavor of humanity for humanity. Framing the shield are, at the left, the branch of oak leaves and acorns, presented in ancient times to honor the civic contribution of one who had saved his brother-citizen's life; and, at the right, the laurel branch, presented to honor personal achievement. Shown together, the oak and laurel branches form a wreath\u2014suggesting that the life-saving and life-enhancing work of the health sciences brings with it an obligation to act honor - ably, courageously, and selflessly. The emblems of the seal imply that one who has the privilege of learning also has the obligation of valor and honor. On the scroll below the shield is the motto\u2014adopted in 1955 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of this institution\u2014\"To Make Man Whole.\"22 UNIVERSITY CATALOG University Foundations history Loma Linda University is part of the Seventh- day Adventist system of higher education. In 1905, the University (formerly College of Medical Evangelists) was founded\u2014through a series of divine providences\u2014at Loma Linda, California, by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The School of Nursing began in 1905. In 1909, the College of Medical Evangelists received its charter as a medi - cal school with the express purpose of preparing physicians who could meet the needs of the whole person. Both schools emphasized the need for healthful living as a part of medical care, a revolu - tionary concept in 1905. The University was designated by the Seventh- day Adventist Church as a center for educating health professionals. The original schools\u2014Nurs - ing and Medicine\u2014have been joined by Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Public Health, Science and Technology, and Religion; and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The curricula of the University are approved by their respective professional organizations. From its small begin - nings, the University has achieved widespread recognition, having sent more of its graduates into international service than has any other uni - versity. It remains committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with the church. From 1918 to 1962, the University operated within health facilities in two cities: Loma Linda and Los Angeles. In September 1962, all health-professional education was consolidated at Loma Linda. In 1967, Loma Linda University Medical Center opened in its new three-tower facility\u2014a landmark cloverleaf structure. The medical center continues on the cutting edge of health care, pro - viding excellent service for patients and expand - ing educational opportunities for students. In 1990, the Board of Trustees designated Loma Linda University a health sciences university\u2014part of a complex comprised of Loma Linda Uni - versity Medical Center, faculty practice plans, and affiliated institutions. The University is a leader in the field of health sciences education, research, and service.The most current campus census figures (April 2009) indicate that the core of the combined facul - ties consists of 1,299 full-time teachers. Part-time and voluntary teachers (1,423\u2014largely clinicians in the professional curricula) bring the total to 2,722. As of Spring Quarter 2009, 742 students from 112 countries outside the United States are represented in the enrollment of 4,114. a Cent Ury of s ervi Ce Today the original 1905 property is part of an ex - panding health sciences campus, which includes: five medical facilities, licensed for approxi - mately 940 beds\u2014 Loma Linda University Medical Hos - pital (LLUCH), Linda University Medical Center East Campus Hospital (LLUECH), 2003; licensed under LLUMC as Loma Linda University Community Medical Center (LLUCMC), 1993\u2014formerly known as Loma Linda Community Hospital; Loma Linda University Heart & Surgical Hospital (LLUHSH), 2009; an acute psychiatric care facility, li - censed in 1991 for 89 beds\u2014the Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (LLUBMC) nine Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center (LLUAHSC) insti - tutes, three LLUAHSC-related research centers, and various school-related research centers (see Learning Resources); and Loma Linda University (on campus, distance education, and online degree pro - grams through the Schools of Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Religion; and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. 1905 School of Nursing 1909 The institution was named College of Medical Evangelists (CME) 1922 Department of Dietetics* 1937 School of Medical Technology* 1941 School of Physical Therapy* A Unique University 23 1945 Radiologic Technology Program* 1948 School of Tropical and Preventive Medicine (reorganized as School of Public Health, 1964) 1953 School of Dentistry 1954 Graduate School (restructured as Faculty of Graduate Studies, 2005) 1958 Dental Hygiene Program 1959 Occupational Therapy Program* 1963 Medical Records Administration Program* 1966 Schools/Programs (see * above) consolidated as the School of Allied Health Professions 1967 Loma Linda University campus merges with La Sierra College 1968 Loma Linda University Medical Center dedicated 1990 Loma Linda and La Sierra campuses become two separate universities 1991 Loma Linda University designated a health sciences university 1997 Loma Linda University and Medical Center (corporately linked together through Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center\u2014LLUAHSC) 2002 School of Pharmacy 2003 School of Science and Technology 2007 School of Religion A Unique University Loma Linda University has always combined a devotion to academic excellence with a concern for spiritual values and a high sense of mission. The motto of the University, \"To make man whole,\" il - lustrates the sense of destiny felt in the University community to act its part in God's ongoing plan for healing and restoring human beings to live with Him in wholeness, both now and in eternity. While Loma Linda University has changed in many ways since its beginning in 1905, the bibli - cal principles that provide its foundation have remained unchanged. seventh-day a dventist heritage Loma Linda University is owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and has deep commitment to respecting the rich diversity of its student body. Students come from many different faiths, and respect and sensitivity for all people\u2014regardless of their culture and ethnic - ity\u2014are viewed as a part of true Christianity. This University has a tradition of religious liberty, and it highly respects students' religious values that differ from those of this academic community. The various perspectives of spiritually commit - ted students are considered to be enriching to this campus and its educational environment. oUr Uni QUe feat Ures Two distinctive features of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which are a part of the Loma Linda experience, become evident to first-time students. The first is the concept of the Sabbath rest, which reminds us of God as Creator. Adven - tists realize this in part by celebrating Saturday as the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. During these hours, University offices, laboratories, libraries, study halls, and recreation facilities are closed to give time for physical and spiritual renewal and worship. A second distinctive feature worth noting is the emphasis on health and wellness. Students will be able to exercise in our recreation and wellness cen - ter, a health-and-fitness complex that received a national award for excellence in utility and design. The cafeterias on campus feature well-prepared vegetarian meals. Note also that the University holds that a drug-, alcohol-, and tobacco-free life - style is essential for achieving the goal of \"whole - ness.\" This means that all students agree to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other \"recre - ational\" drugs while enrolled at the University. Spiritual Life Worship experiences represent a critical dimen - sion of the educational experience at Loma Linda University and are available to the student many times throughout the week. In addition to regular Friday evening and Saturday services, many class, school, club, and University activities include a component of worship and praise to God.24 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Cha PeL servi Ces In keeping with the commitment of our mis - sion, Loma Linda University students have special requirements, such as chapel service attendance each Wednesday morning in the University Church. The chapel programs provide a variety of opportunities to integrate faith and learning. Undergraduates who live in the residence halls are also expected to attend worships in the residence halls each week. reLigion C Lasses Classes in religion are part of the core cur - riculum in each of the University's schools and programs. These classes deal with the study of the Bible, ethics, clinical ministry (which concentrates on ways to understand and meet the spiritual needs of patients in a manner that is noninvasive and individually appropriate), and a variety of other issues related to the student's field of study and personal spiritual journey. All students who choose Loma Linda as their university make a commitment to conduct their lives in a manner that reflects their sense of responsibility for the honor and integrity of the University and themselves as members of its com - munity. Learning Environment Loma Linda University is dedicated to creating a learning environment that promotes the lifelong pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and skills used for selfless service to mankind. Through intentional educational strategies, Loma Linda University in - terweaves its vision, mission, and core values with its student learning outcomes. The University's mission of wholeness gives focus to the learn - ing environment that balances mind, body, and spirit (psycho-social-physical-spiritual) and gives meaning to the motto of mission-focused learning. In this health care institution, critical and analyti - cal thinking skills in the health, behavioral, and natural sciences are blended with a commitment to spiritual and moral development.Loma Linda University pledges to students, staff, faculty, alumni, and the local and global com - munities its commitment to upholding integrity, valuing diversity, engaging with the community in service-learning scholarship, and honoring the process of ongoing self-assessment for the purpose of continuous quality improvement. The University and each of its schools, programs, and classes provide clearly defined student learning outcomes and measurable performance indicators to create a learning atmosphere that is clear and focused. The University is engaged in systematic aca - demic program review. Curricular maps are maintained for each program to assure alignment between student learning outcomes and planned academic activities. Program review follows care - fully developed schedules as outlined in school-specific assessment matrices. Loma Linda University is committed to using as - sessment data to guide academic and fiscal master planning for the University. The total resources of the University offer a wealth of opportunity to the student with initia - tive and willingness to develop individual capac - ity to the fullest extent. The academic resources, affiliated clinical facilities, and community agencies constitute a rich educational environ - ment both in classroom instruction and in guided experience. Major facilities utilized for clinical affiliations and internships include the University Medical Center; the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veter - ans Medical Center; and numerous other hospi - tals and agencies located in the Redlands, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Los Angeles areas; as well as throughout the United States and abroad. In addition, students find varied opportunities for service and learning in the immediate University community, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs.

The SAC Health System provides low-cost health care to persons who have limited or no access to medical care in the tradi - tional system. Satellite clinics serve populations at several locations. The clinics are staffed by a wide variety of health care professionals and provide an ideal setting for interdisciplinary training in today's changing health care climate. Student involvement includes developing nutrition and health-education programs; creating question - naires for data collection; writing proposals for funding; and actual hands-on experience at the clinic, i.e., obtaining patient histories, assessing psychosocial problems, analyzing laboratory specimens, and providing nutrition and health-education counseling. For additional information, call 909/382-7100 or visit the SACHS Web site at <www.llu.edu/ central/sachs/index.page>.Community- academic Partners in service (C aPs) The mission of Community-Academic Partners in Service (CAPS) is to develop reciprocal and sustainable relationships between Loma Linda University students, faculty, and staff, and the local community. Its vision is to put into practice Christ's mission of love and compassion through meaningful community engagement. The CAPS office is committed to raising awareness about existing local community engagement activities being conducted through our schools and to con - nect students/faculty to these opportunities. It also serves to create and strengthen partnerships between Loma Linda University and the local community. University Libraries major library resources Specialized libraries are located in various medi - cal and school departments and in other entities on campus.

(Example: A student who enrolled for Autumn Quarter, but who does not enroll for Winter Quarter, will be inactivated at the close of registration [two weeks into the quarter] for the subsequent Spring Quar - ter). Inactivated or formally withdrawn students who wish to return to complete their degree program are required to reapply with sufficient time for adequate review of any new transcript credits and advisement of any new program requirements. The reapplication process also requires the submission of official transcripts from all col - leges/universities attended since the student last attended this University. Official transcripts from colleges/universities the student attended while enrolled at this University must also be submitted if they were not submitted prior to inactivation. Students who reapply to a program are subject to the program requirements published in the Catalog in effect at the time of reentry. All gradu - ates are expected to have documented current knowledge in their field of study as of the date of graduation (date on diploma). Leave-of-absence status does not extend the stu - dent's five-year (master's) or seven-year (doctoral) time limit for completion of a degree program. If the reapplicant is within a year of his/her time limit at the time of reapplication, or if the time limit has expired and the reapplicant is requesting readmission and a time extension, then s/he must submit a quarter-by-quarter plan for meeting all degree requirements. The re-admission request will be evaluated with the degree-completion time extension.30 UNIVERSITY CATALOG stUdy d eferraL Applicants are accepted for a specified entering date. If the applicant does not enter the program at the time stated for admission, the application will become inactive unless the school receives a written request to hold the application. Not all programs permit an applicant to defer an applica - tion; however, for those programs for which this is permitted, an application may not be deferred for more than one year. After one year, a new applica - tion must be submitted. Accepted applicants who wish to reactivate their acceptance at a later date must apply to the school for reactivation. Previ - ous acceptance does not guarantee acceptance at a later time. Individuals must meet admission and graduation requirements that are in effect for the school year during which they first register. re-entran Ce See Continuous Enrollment policy in this section of the CATALOG.

The deposit will be held by the University during the program of study and will be applied to the last quarter's tuition charge. Al - ternatively, the deposit may be refunded, less any outstanding balance on the account, if the student is denied a visa or terminates his/her program. Scholarships and assistantships for international students are scarce. The student should contact his/her advisor regarding availability and applica - tion information. International students must obtain written authorization from International Student and Scholar Services before accepting any on-campus employment. Off-campus employment requires prior issue of a work permit by the U.S. Citizen - ship and Immigration Services. F- and J-visa students must limit their employment to twenty hours or less per week while registered for courses and while classes are in session during three of four quarters in an academic year. Regulations allow full-time work (forty hours or less per week) during school breaks and summer vacations (if a student's program allows summer quarters off). For questions, please telephone International Stu - dent and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. visas f-1 st Udent visas Loma Linda University is authorized by the United States Department of Homeland Security to issue F-visa applications (i.e., I-20 forms). The F-1 student visa is the visa of choice for most international students coming to Loma Linda University. This visa allows some nondegree study (e.g., certificates, preceptorships, and English-as-a-second-language studies). Degree-earning stu - dents are subject to study load requirements and are allowed limited on-campus employment. The I-20 is issued after a student: 1. has been accepted into a program and all official transcripts (mark sheets) have been received by the University, 2. has paid the advance deposit, and 3. has documented his/her financial plan for the chosen program. International Student and Scholar Services can be contacted at 909/558-4955 for further informa - tion regarding F-1 student visas and the regula - tions governing this visa. J-visa ex Change P rogram Loma Linda University has an exchange vsitor program that is approved by the U.S. Department of State. This J-visa exchange program is autho - rized to sponsor/host degree-earning students, nondegree (continuing education) students, short-term scholars, visiting professors, and research scholars. The J-visa form, DS-2019, is issued after an exchange visitor has been accepted into a pro - gram, scholar position, or professor position; and has documented his/her financial plan (including health insurance for J-1 and J-2 dependents). Loma Linda University also hosts exchange visi - tors who are sponsored by other organizations (e.g., Fulbright scholars). As a hosting institution, Loma Linda University has limited authority over an exchange visitor since the authority resides in the sponsoring organization. Under current exchange visitor regulations, J-2 dependents are allowed to enroll part or full time at Loma Linda University. Also, their credits earned can be either degree or nondegree appli - cable. J-1 exchange visitors are allowed to work; but employment guidelines differ, depending on the exchange category. Contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955 for further information and regulations governing the Ex - change Visitor Program.34 UNIVERSITY CATALOG other visas International students may enter the U.S. on a wide variety of visas. However, a visa may have to be changed before a student can commence academic studies at this University. For further information regarding regulations and study op - tions for specific visa types, contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. stUdy L oad Both the F- and J-student-visa regulations require the successful completion of a full study load during each quarter of each academic year (as defined by each program). A minimum of 12 units per quarter is usually considered full time for an undergraduate program; 8 units per quarter is considered full time for a graduate program. In any quarter in which there will be a reduced study load, prior approval is needed from an international student advisor in International Student and Scholar Services. transfer st Udents International students currently attending other schools in the United States who have either an I-20 or a DS-2019 and who wish to attend Loma Linda University must do a school-to-school transfer. The timing of a transfer is critical in order to maintain visa status; therefore, it is important to consult with an international advisor at each school as soon as the acceptance letter is received. stUdy L oad Both the F- and J-student-visa regulations require the successful completion of a full study load during each quarter of every academic year (as defined by each program).

Loma Linda University PhiLoso Phy of g enera L edUCation As a Seventh-day Adventist health sciences institution, Loma Linda University seeks to exemplify a life of service and sensitivity beyond Division of General Studies 35 the requirements of academic excellence within a professional discipline. With its rich spiritual heritage, the University places special emphasis on educating its students for a life of service in a global community. General education at Loma Linda University con - sists of courses, lectures, programs, and activities coordinated with the intent to integrate faith and learning. In addition to the basics of cultural heri - tage and diversity, scientific inquiry and analysis, communication, and wellness, the curriculum emphasizes the University's spiritual heritage; as well as moral and ethical decision making that is grounded in Christian principles. Thus, a general education is considered to be the cornerstone upon which students begin cultivat - ing their abilities to: 1. Understand the fundamental Christian prin - ciples and Adventist heritage that undergird Loma Linda University. 2. Make informed moral and ethical decisions. 3. Incorporate critical-thinking skills into per - sonal and professional experience. 4. Value individuals with diverse capabilities and ideological, ethnic, gender, and genera - tional perspectives. 5. Communicate effectively. 6. Undertake scientific inquiry and analysis. 7. Appreciate the contributions of the arts and humanities to society. 8. Examine the historical basis of the health sci - ences professions. 9. Develop self-awareness through balance of mental, physical, social, and spiritual aspects of daily living. 10. Model servant leadership in health care as exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth. The Loma Linda University philosophy of gen - eral education creates a unique learning environ - ment committed to the concept of human whole - ness. Faculty are selected who embrace the spirit as well as the specifics of general education and who purpose to extend its goals into all aspects of university life\u2014from the residence hall programs to the core of professional studies\u2014thus adding an invisible curriculum to the required course of - ferings. It is this spirit in tandem with the specifics of a liberal arts education that inspires students to achieve academic excellence, value diversity, pursue lifelong learning, and live to bless others.

Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The most current Stu - dent Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies, and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Ad - ditional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the Univer - sity is available from the respective school. Student Life 41 from University to s tUdent Loma Linda University was established to provide education in a distinctively Christian environment. Students are expected to respect the standards and ideals of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Prospective students have the freedom to choose or reject University or school standards, but the decision must be made before enrollment. Application to and enrollment in Loma Linda University constitute the student's commitment to honor and abide by the academic and social prac - tices and regulations stated in announcements, bulletins, handbooks, and other published materi - als; and to maintain a manner that is mature and compatible with the University's function as a professional institution of higher learning. It is inevitable that the student will come under question if academic performance is below stan - dard; student duties are neglected; social conduct is unbecoming; or attitudes demonstrate deficien - cies such as poor judgment, moral inadequacy, or other forms of immaturity. Procedures for evaluation of academic and non - academic performance\u2014as well as for the student to exercise his/her right of appeal\u2014are described in the current CATALOG and in each school's sec - tion of the Student Handbook. Grievances regard - ing both academic and nonacademic matters must be processed according to these published griev - ance procedures. After a student files an appeal or grievance, the faculty assesses the student's fitness for a career in the chosen profession and recom - mends to the dean appropriate action regarding the student's continuance or discontinuance. Prospective students who have questions con - cerning the University's expectations should seek specific information prior to enrollment. Who Le-Person h eaLth The University regards the student from a cos - mopolitan and comprehensive point of view. It is cosmopolitan in that historically the University's global mission has promoted bonds and oppor - tunities in education and service without regard to gender, or to national, racial, or geographical origin. It is comprehensive in that the University's concern for the welfare of the student traditionally has been an integrated concern for assisting the student toward whole-person health\u2014balanced development of spiritual, social, physical, and mental health. Cultivating the health of any one part enhances the health of all parts. Neglecting or abusing the health of one harms the health of all. Before one can experience whole-person health, there must be a practical appreciation of the inter - dependent interaction of each part of the whole. Students from all schools of Loma Linda Univer - sity may congregate and participate in the multi - faceted programs offered that involve the holistic concept of social, intellectual, physical, emotional, and spiritual wellness. These programs support Loma Linda University's motto, \"To make man whole.\" spiritual health In addition to personal quiet times, opportuni - ties for the student to further develop rich, person - al spiritual resources are provided in scheduled religious exercises and activities and in informal association with others who cherish spiritual values. Religion classes as well as weekly chapel services are part of the required curriculum. social health Situated within easy access of the ocean, moun - tains, and desert, the University provides numer - ous opportunities for students to complement their formal learning through participation in a wide variety of recreational, cultural, and other activities. A variety of University-, school-, and group-sponsored events encourages students to relax and become better acquainted with one another. Through these activities and events, students can enrich their group interaction and leadership experiences, increase their enjoyment of and interest in fields outside their profession, develop their talents, enhance wholesome and memorable association with others, and cultivate supportive and lifelong social relationships. mental health The University promotes mental health by en - couraging students to study and practice prin -42 UNIVERSITY CATALOG ciples of sound psychological health and to access state-of-the-art counseling and mental health services, as needed. Physical health The University promotes physical fitness by encouraging recreational interests and by provid - ing courses in field exercises, body building, and health instruction. An effort is exerted to interest each student in some recreational and health-building activity that may be carried over to enhance future life. reCreation/We LLness: t he drayson Center The Drayson Center, Loma Linda University's recreation and wellness center, provides state-of-the-art fitness facilities.

Name changes must be processed no later than six months prior to graduation if the new name is to appear on the diploma. Professional apparel Clinic and laboratory apparel are distinctive arti - cles of dress specified by the department or school and are to be worn only in the manner prescribed and under the conditions specified in the school or department dress code. Student uniforms are to be maintained in clean, presentable condition. Information on the required professional dress is provided in Section III of this CATALOG and in the University Student Handbook. Personal appearance Students in the classroom or clinical environ - ment must exhibit personal grooming consistent with expectations of the health care institution, the profession, the school, and the University. Specific guidelines regarding grooming and attire are provided in Section III of this CATALOG and in the University Student Handbook.Personal property The school assumes no responsibility for the loss of the student's personal property, instruments, or other items by theft, fire, or unknown causes. The student is expected to assume responsibility for the safekeeping of personal belongings. Cars and transportation Because the student is responsible for transporta - tion arrangements and costs for special projects and off-campus clinics, it is advantageous for the student to have access to a car. The University enforces traffic rules and regula - tions as provided for by the State of California Vehicle Code. It is the sole responsibility of the driver of any vehicle on University property to become familiar with these regulations. Driv - ers are held responsible for any infraction of the regulations. Copies of the brochure entitled Loma Linda University Traffic and Parking Regulations are available at the Department of Security. Vehicles used by students on campus must be registered with the Department of Security. Returning students must go to the Department of Security annually in September to renew registra - tion. Confidentiality The Health Insurance Portability and Account - ability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 requires that all health care professionals maintain the highest level of confidentiality in matters pertaining to clients. Discussions or written assignments relating to cli - ent information, either health related or personal, may not include identifying data. Clients' privacy and rights are to be protected. Failure to maintain confidentiality could result in legal action. For additional information, see \"Introduction to HIPAA\" at <home.mc.llumc.edu/Departments/LLUHS-Departments/HIPAA-In - formation/HIPAA-Help/Introduction-to-HIPAA/Index.html>.48 UNIVERSITY CATALOG substance abuse As a practical application of its motto, \"To make man whole,\" Loma Linda University is committed to providing a learning environment conducive to the fullest possible human development. Because the University holds that a lifestyle free of alcohol, tobacco, and recreational/illegal drugs is essential for achieving this goal, it maintains policies that foster a campus environment free of these sub - stances. All students are expected to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, or recreational or illegal mind-altering substances. Possession or use of these substances may be cause for dismissal. For details regarding the University's drug-free environment\u2014as well as information regard - ing prevention, detection, assessment, treatment, relapse prevention, confidentiality, and disci - pline\u2014see the Loma Linda University Student Handbook, Section V, University Policies: Alcohol, controlled substances, and tobacco policy. sexual harassment Sexual harassment is reprehensible and will not be tolerated by the University. It subverts the mis - sion of the University and threatens the well-be - ing, educational experience, or careers of students, faculty, employees, and patients. Because of the sensitive nature of situations involving sexual harassment and to assure speedy and confidential resolution of these issues, stu - dents should contact the office of the dean in their respective schools. A more comprehensive statement of the policy regarding sexual harassment and sexual stan - dards can be found in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook, Section V, University Policies. employment It is recommended that students limit work obligations (outside employment for income) that divert time, attention, and strength from the ardu - ous tasks of class preparation, clinical practice, and/or training in their chosen career. A student wishing to work during the school year should consult the Office of the Dean of the school in which s/he is enrolled regarding employment restrictions or prohibitions. employment for international students International students must obtain written authorization from International Student and Scholar Services before accepting any on-campus employment. Off-campus employment requires prior issue of a work permit by the Bureau of Citi - zenship and Immigration Services. F- and J-visa students must limit their employment to twenty hours or less per week while registered for courses and while classes are in session during three of four quarters in an academic year. Regulations allow full-time work (forty hours or less per week) during school breaks and summer vacations (if students' programs allow summer quarters off). For questions, please telephone International Stu - dent and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. aCademi C aU thority The Office of the Dean of the school in which the student is enrolled is the final authority in all academic matters, with the exception of General Education requirements, and is charged with the interpretation and enforcement of academic requirements. Any exceptions or changes in aca - demic requirements, graduation requirements, or grades are not valid unless approved by the dean. Any actions taken by individual faculty members with regard to these matters are advisory only and are not binding on the school or the Univer - sity unless approved by the dean. aCademi C integrity The academically dishonest act considers that ac - ademic dishonesty intentionally violates the com - munity of trust upon which all learning is based, intentionally compromises the orderly transfer of knowledge from teacher to student, and is incon - sistent with good professional and moral behavior. Accordingly, the penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. Student Life 49 Acts of dishonesty include but are not limited to: theft; falsifying or changing grades or other aca - demic records; plagiarism or excessive paraphrasing of someone else's work; knowingly giving, obtaining, or falsifying information during examinations or other academic or professional practice assign - ments; using unauthorized aids during examina - tions; loud and disruptive behavior during lec - tures, demonstrations, or examinations; excessive unexcused absences from classes or from clinical assignments. \"Examinations\" are defined as regularly sched - uled tests, quizzes (scheduled or unscheduled), final examinations, comprehensive assessments, take-home tests, open-book tests, and any other assignment given by an instructor or preceptor whether for a grade, points toward a grade, or for zero points (e.g., a learning exercise). Instructors and students are responsible for reporting instances of academic dishonesty for investigation. An instructor may take immediate action during an examination or other point-gen - erating activity in order to maintain the integrity of the academic process. Substantiated violations are to be brought before the designated disci - plinary body for action. Disciplinary action may include receiving a failing grade on the examina - tion or assignment, receiving a failing grade in the course, suspension, or permanent dismissal from the program. Conduct Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner during didactic and clini - cal training. Professional conduct includes (but is not limited to) punctuality; and respect for other people, their property, and their right to learn. It also includes an appropriate respect for those in authority. Students of Loma Linda University are expected to behave in a manner that will not bring criticism upon themselves, the program, the school, or the University.Because students may be exposed to patients' relatives and friends in any public place, and because their conversations and their attitudes have an effect on those around them, students are asked to observe the following: Any information given to the student by a patient or contained in a medical record must be held in strict confidence. Therefore, the discussion of a patient's diagnosis and treatment or other clinically related topics should be extremely guarded. A patient's family and community people may be listen - ing and may incorrectly interpret the things discussed. Careless talk may lead to mal - practice litigation. A joking or casual attitude toward illness and medical treatment should not be dis - played since it may seem uncaring and be disturbing to those who are ill and suffering, as well as to the family members. Student and staff behavior in professional situations may be the deciding influence for or against Christian beliefs, values, and a health-enhancing lifestyle. An in-depth description of the professional conduct expected of students is contained in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook. grievan Ce ProC edUre Grievances related to sexual harassment, racial harassment, or discrimination against the dis - abled shall be pursued in accordance with Uni - versity policies specifically relating to these items. Grievances related to academic matters or other issues covered by specific policies shall be made pursuant to the policies of the school in which the student is enrolled. A student who questions whether the process provided by the school has followed the policy of the school in regard to his/her grievance may request the office of the provost conduct a review of the process used by the school in responding to his/her academic grievance. Students who believe that an error has been made or that they have been dealt with in an inappropriate manner by an office or nonacademic department of the University such as records, student finance, student affairs, health services, 50 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Drayson Center, etc., may seek correction by the following steps: 1. The student may put his/her complaint in writing and provide it to the head of the department or office involved. The student may request an appointment and discuss this matter with the department head. The department head will make a decision and provide a written answer to the student within fourteen days of receiving the stu - dent's written complaint or meeting with the student, whichever is later. If the answer is not satisfactory to the student, s/he may\u2014 2. Put the complaint in writing and send it to the dean of student affairs for review. The matter will be considered at the next meeting of the dean's council, and the student will be informed in writing of the council's response within seven days of the council's consider - ation of the complaint. CoPyright v ioLations The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, USC) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material. Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photo - copy or other reproduction. One of these specific conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be \"used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research.\" If a user makes a request for or later uses a photocopy or reproduc - tion for purposes in excess of \"fair use,\" that user may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law. Comm UniCation d eviCes All communication devices must be set to \"off\" or \"vibrate\" during class, laboratory, clinic, or cha - pel. No cell phones, PDAs, calculators, laptops, or other electronic or communication items may be used in the classroom, testing facility, or labora - tory unless specifically a part of that activity and approved by the faculty member in charge.Academic Policies and Information Students of the University are responsible for in - forming themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matricu - lation, and graduation. In this section (Section II) are the University regulations. See Section III for regulations that pertain to each school and program. registration Registration dates are published on the Web at <www.llu.edu/ssweb/registration.html>. The Web should be checked for specific dates of registra - tion, since these dates vary during some quarters due to holiday schedules. Posted deadlines for registration and change of registration are in ef - fect and binding. After consultation with their academic advisor, students register online. Registration procedure includes entering classes online and clearing finance. Students are advised to print the Request for Clearance Submitted form from the Web in order to retain written documentation that they have requested financial clearance. Upon comple - tion of registration, the student must obtain an ID card at the University Office of Student Affairs (first quarter registration only). A late registration period of at least a week prior to the beginning of the quarter and extending to five days after the quarter begins is provided, during which a late-registration fee of $50 will be charged, unless the course is offered as an inten - sive that requires registration before the end of the first day of class. Students may not attend class without being registered. No credit is granted for academic work performed during any quarter without registra - tion. Change in r egistration A change in registration requires filing a Reg - istration Change Request (Add/Drop) form with the Office of University Records. Students receive written verification each time a change of pro - Academic Policies and Information 51 gram is officially approved. Students are advised to retain this written verification as documenta - tion of their registration. A student may add courses that follow the general University calendar during the first seven calendar days of the quarter. Courses that follow the general University calendar may be dropped during the first fourteen days of the quarter with - out academic penalty. Course changes after the fourteenth day of the quarter affect the permanent grade record. Students may withdraw from a course prior to the fourteen calendar days before the final examination week, after which time withdrawals are no longer permitted. stUdy Load Usually an academic study load is defined in terms of credit units. A full undergraduate load is considered to be 12 or more units per quarter; a full graduate load is considered to be 8 units per quarter. The normal course load, including all course work for which a student may be registered at this or another institution, is 16 quarter units for an undergraduate student and 12 quarter units for a graduate student. Full-time study loads are those specified by the departments for each program. Students of exceptional ability may register for ad - ditional course work upon recommendation of the department and consent of the dean. non-LLU Co Urses as Part of totaL Load for f inan CiaL aid Regular courses for which a student is registered at another financial-aid eligible institution consti - tute part of the student's study load. Courses must be transferable and required for completion of the student's Loma Linda University degree program. Correspondence and independent study courses are excluded, per federal aid regulations. Only when the student enrolls in such courses using the Consortium Agreement form (from the Office of Financial Aid) will the course(s) count on the student's total load as eligible for financial aid and loan deferment purposes.A person who is not enrolled in regular classes but who is occupied in research, dissertation, or thesis, is classified as a student. By filing an Academic Load Validation form every quarter at registration, the academic load may be validated for loan deferment. stUdent Leve L Students enrolled in a professional program in which they are classified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior will be classified according to the level of the course work they are taking (e.g., a stu - dent with a previous baccalaureate degree pursu - ing another baccalaureate degree would be classi - fied as a sophomore while taking sophomore-level courses, etc.). Students enrolled in block programs are classi - fied according to the level of the block in which they are enrolled (e.g., master's-1st, 2nd, or 3rd year; or freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, as is appropriate for the degree program; or PY1 [pro - fessional year as: nondegree-applicable 301-499 upper division graduate 601-699 graduate: seminar, research, thesis, or dissertation 701-899 professional or clinical 901-999 continuing education, without academic credit 500-level course work may not apply toward a baccalaureate degree unless the instructor ap - proves it, and both deans (dean of the school of - fering the course and dean of the school in which the student is enrolled) give permission; and provided the credit does not apply toward both an undergraduate and a graduate degree. Approval is not needed if the course is part of a coordinated program. No courses numbered in the 700s, 800s, or 900s may apply toward a baccalaureate degree.52 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Unit of Credit Credit is recorded in quarter units. One unit represents a minimum of 10 class hours in lecture or 30 hours in laboratory practice. attendan Ce Regular attendance at all appointments (class, clinic, laboratory, chapel) is required begin - ning with the first day of each term. A pattern of absence, excused and unexcused, will be referred to the school's designated academic authority for consideration and action. Excused absences are defined as follows: Illness, verified by a physician's statement or official statement from Student Health Service submitted to the school's designated academic authority; Participation in an institution-sponsored activity (verified by a written statement from a faculty sponsor); Recognizable emergency approved by the school's designated academic authority. Tardiness is disruptive, distracting, and incon - sistent with professional behavior. Students who arrive after the beginning of class may be counted absent. Information regarding the school's designated academic authority can be obtained from the Of - fice of the Dean. CoLLege Leve L examination Program (CL eP) The College Level Examination Program (CLEP), a national program of credit by examination, of - fers persons of all ages and backgrounds new op - portunities to obtain recognition for college-level achievement, no matter how acquired. As of July 2001, general examinations are no lon - ger offered; however, the policy remains in effect for students who took general examinations prior to that date. No credit is granted for the CLEP gen - eral examinations in English composition, math - ematics, or science courses requiring a laboratory. As of July 1, 2004, in order to receive Loma Linda University credit, students must complete all ex -aminations for CLEP credit within six months af - ter having received their initial degree compliance report. A student will be allowed to challenge a given course by examination only once. CLEP scores will be accepted at C or better until percen - tiles are available from CLEP . Credit is granted for scores at or above the 50th percentile for the sub - ject examinations, and at the 65th percentile for general examinations in the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences/history. Credit by e xamination For certain courses offered by the University, a student in an undergraduate degree program may earn credit by passing an equivalency examina - tion administered by the appropriate school and department. Such an examination is at least equal in scope and difficulty to a final examination in the course and may include materials supplied by CLEP or other agencies. A graduate program should be used to acquire new knowledge. Since the purpose of credit by ex - amination is to validate prior knowledge, graduate credit may not be earned by examination. If a re - quired course in the degree program is a repeat of prior learning, the student may request a waiver, thus making it possible to take elective courses that would increase knowledge. A student currently enrolled in a degree pro - gram at this University who desires credit by equivalency examination petitions the dean of the school offering the course, and, upon approval, pays a testing fee. See Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section for examination fee. Equivalency examinations may not duplicate credit already earned through course work, in - cluding courses taken for audit. A grade of CR (Credit) is given only after the student has completed one quarter, or the equiva - lent, at this University; and has earned 12 units of credit with a grade-point average of at least 2.0 in undergraduate courses. Units earned by equivalency may not be used as part of the enrolled load. Equivalency examinations must be taken before the final quarter of residency. The maximum amount of credit that may be earned by equivalency examination is determined by each school but may not exceed a maximum of Academic Policies and Information 53 20 percent of the units required for the degree or certificate. CoUrse Waiver Certain course requirements in a program may be waived on the basis of previously completed course work, experience, or licensure. An exami - nation for waiver credit, if required, may be taken only once and must be taken before the last quar - ter of the program of study. Waiver of a specific course requirement does not reduce the number of units required for a program or residency. A waiver examination does not carry academic credit and cannot be used to make up for a course in which an unsatisfactory grade was received. For examination fee, see Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section. Permission to waive a course requirement in the School of Pharmacy requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean. inde Pendent s tUdy Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent of the department chair and/or the Office of the Dean. The student is responsible for completion of the Directed/Independent Study Title Request form in addition to the regular reg - istration. University policy limits directed study to 12 quarter units of undergraduate credit and 8 units of graduate credit in a degree program. Individual programs may further limit these units. The Office of the Dean should be consulted regarding limits on credit earned through inde - pendent study. Independent study is to be com - pleted in adequate time before graduation to allow recording in the Office of University Records. extension s tUdy To be acceptable for credit, an extension course must be evaluated as to its equivalence to an ac - cepted course. To assure that the course will trans - fer to Loma Linda University, the student should contact the Office of University Records prior to taking the course. Registration for extension study requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean.sChoLasti C standing grades and grade points The following grades and grade points are used in this University. Each course taught in the schools has been approved for either a letter grade and/or an S/U grade. A 4.0 Outstanding performance. A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 Very good performance for undergraduate credit; Satisfactory performance for graduate credit. B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 Satisfactory performance for undergraduate credit. Minimum performance for which credit isgranted toward a degree in the School of Nursing or the School of Allied Health Professions. C- 1.7 Minimum performance for which credit is granted toward a degree in the School of Dentistry, the School of Pharmacy, or the School of Public Health. D+ 1.3 D 1.0 Minimum performance for which undergraduate credit is granted, except as indicated above. F 0.0 Failure\u2014given for not meeting minimum performance. S none Satisfactory performance\u2014counted toward graduation. Equivalent to a C grade or better in undergraduate courses, or a B grade or better in graduate courses. An S grade is not computed in the grade-point average. A student may request a grade of S in only a limited amount of course work as determined by the school. This is done by the student's filing with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week. Once filed, the grade is not subject to change.54 UNIVERSITY CATALOG U none Unsatisfactory performance\u2014given only when performance for an S-specified course falls below a C grade level in an undergraduate course or a B grade level in a graduate course. Similar filing procedures as given for S grade above are required. The U grade is not computed in the grade-point average. S/N none Satisfactory performance in a clock hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the S grade given for a credit hour course. U/N none Unsatisfactory performance in a clock hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the U grade given for a credit hour course. CR none Credit for Credit by Examination. Counted toward graduation/units earned but not units attempted. Such credit cannot be counted for financial aid purposes. NC none No credit for Credit by Examination. Does not count for any purpose. W Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawal from a course prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week. Withdrawals during the first fourteen calendar days of a quarter or the first seven calendar days of a five-week summer session are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the cut-off date. Withdrawals outside this time frame, upon recommendation of the dean, may be removed at the discretion of the vice president for academic af - fairs. In the case of nontraditionally scheduled courses, W will be given for withdrawal from a course prior to completion of 80 percent of the course, excluding the final examina - tion period. Withdrawals during the first 20 per - cent of a course, excluding the final examination period, are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriateform prior to the date when this 20 percent of the course is completed. A student may withdraw only once from a named cognate course that s/he is failing at the time of with - drawal. UW Unofficial Withdrawal\u2014indicates that the student discontinued class attendance after the close of registration but failed to withdraw officially. I Incomplete\u2014given when the majority of the course work has been completed and circumstances beyond a student's control result in the student being unable to complete the quarter. An I notation may be changed to a grade only by the instructor before the end of the following term (excluding the summer sessions for those not in attendance during that term). Incomplete units are not calculated in the grade-point average. By use of the petition form\u2014avail - able online at <www.llu.edu/ central/ssweb/registration.page>\u2014the stu - dent requests an I notation from the instructor, stating the reason for the request and obtaining the signatures of the instructor, the departmentchair, and the associate dean. The form is left with the instructor. The instructor reports the I notation on the grade-report form, as well as the grade the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the time limit. The petition form is then filed with the Office of University Records along with the grade reportform. The notation I is not granted as a remedy for overload, failure on final examination, absence from final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. IP In Progress\u2014indicates that the course has a duration of more than a single term and will be completed by the student no later than the final term of Academic Policies and Information 55 the course, not to exceed five quarters for independent study and research courses (original quarter of registration plus four additional quarters). The student's final grade will be reported on the instructor's grade report at the end of the term in which the course is completed. If the course work is not completed within the five-quarter time limit, a grade of U will be given. AU Audit\u2014indicates registration for attendance only, with 80 percent class attendance considered a requirement. A request to change a credit course to audit or an audit course to credit may be made no later than the fourteenth calendar day after the beginning of a quarter, or the seventh calendar day after the beginning of the five-week summer session. (This does not apply to short summer courses lasting only a week or two.) AUW Audit Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawing from a course, or to indicate that the 80 percent class attendance requirement was not met. aCademi C standing The following classifications are based on scholastic performance, as defined by each school within the University: regular standing or aca - demic probation. veterans b enefits Under Title 38 of the U.S. Code, Loma Linda University is approved for the training of veterans and other eligible persons. Information regarding eligibility for these programs may be obtained by calling 888/GIBILL1 or 888/442-4551. Application for benefits must be made directly to the Veterans Administration (V A) and may be done via the Web. The Office of University Records serves as the certifying official for Loma Linda University. Stu - dents should contact the certifying official prior to their first enrollment certification.Students receiving veteran's benefits who fail for three consecutive quarters to maintain the cumulative grade-point average (G.P .A.) required for graduation will have their benefits interrupted, and the V A office will be notified. School of Medicine students must maintain satis - factory grades for all required courses for the year in which they are currently enrolled. If a grade in a required course reflects unsatisfactory progress, the School of Medicine student will not be certi - fied until his/her probationary status (usually one year) has been removed. For more information, open links to the V A Web site (\"Students\" or \"Prospective Students\") on the University Web page at <www.llu.edu>. Priva Cy rights of s tUdents in aC ademi C reCords Under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), students have full rights of privacy with regard to their academic records, including their grade reports. Grades are available to the student online at <www.llu.edu/ central/ssweb/in - dex.page>. The Office of University Records sends one copy of the student grade report to the school. The campus is authorized under FERPA to re - lease \"directory information\" concerning students. The University has classified the following as student directory information which may be re - leased: name, address (permanent and local), pic - ture, marital status, birth date, school, program, class, previous college, and telephone number, unless the student specifically requests in writing that the information not be released. Directory information will only be released by the academic dean's office of the school in which the student is enrolled. All requests for directory information received by all other offices of the University will be transferred to the appropriate school office. grade Change Faculty members are responsible for evaluat - ing and assigning grades. A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in arriving at or recording a grade. Such changes are permissible up to the end of the succeeding term.56 UNIVERSITY CATALOG The faculty member must obtain the dean's signature on the Change of Grade form after the initial grade has been entered. rePeating a Co Urse Once grades have been posted for a course, a student wishing to improve his/her grade must repeat the course. When repeating a course, the student must attend class and laboratory ses - sions as ordinarily required and take all regularly scheduled examinations. The amount of tuition paid for repeated courses is determined by the school. Both the original and the repeat grades will appear on the student's permanent record, but only the repeat grade is computed in the G.P .A. and included in the total units earned. A student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in a stu - dent's degree program. PersonaL Leave of a bsen Ce A leave of absence is defined as being away from school for the remainder of the quarter, to a maxi - mum of one year, without the intent to return. The appropriate program withdrawal form must be obtained from the University Web site and ap - proved by the dean or his/her designee prior to the student's departure. Stipulations for re-entry are given to the student in writing. The student should consult the Office of the Dean regarding the possibility of maintaining health coverage and continuous registration during the leave period. Withdra WaL To withdraw from a course(s), the student must complete a Registration Change Request (Add/Drop) form. If a student finds it necessary to withdraw from a degree or certificate program, the dean (or his/her designee) must be notified in writing. The student then arranges for formal withdrawal from the program by filing a Program Withdrawal form from the University Web site. The Change of Program form or the Registra - tion Change Request (Add/Drop) form should be completed as soon as possible after the student determines that s/he cannot complete the quarter. These forms must be filed no later than fourteen days prior to the end of the quarter. Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term are not included in the student's perma - nent record. If a student is discontinuing the entire program, the date the Program Withdrawal form is properly submitted to the Office of University Records will be the date of withdrawal used to calculate tuition refunds. Tuition is refunded according to the practice outlined in the Financial Information sec - tion of this CATALOG. Failure to file the Program Withdrawal form may result in avoidable charges to the student's account. The tuition refund policy for off-campus students is listed under the appli - cable school in Section III of this CATALOG. administrative Withdra WaL Students who fail to make arrangements for a leave of absence or continuing registration may be administratively withdrawn from school. After one quarter, if the student has not re-enrolled, s/he will be inactivated. faCiLitating the t ransfer of C Urrent Ly registered stUdents The following steps apply to processing an ap - plication for a student who is currently registered at Loma Linda University: 1. The student submits application (online or paper) to a new program that is not part of a joint/ combined degree arrangement. 2. The Office of University Records promi - nently flags the transcript as being from a currently registered student. 3. The flagged University transcript is forward - ed to the new program for evaluation. 4. The new program contacts a designated per - son in the home school/program to obtain relevant information about the student with - out revealing that an application is under consideration. 5. If the new program decides to accept the stu - dent, the acceptance letter instructs the stu - dent to take one of the following actions\u2014 Financial Policies and Information 57 Send a letter/ deposit accepting the offer of admission and process a Total With - drawal form or a Leave of Absence form for the program s/he is leaving, or Decline the offer of admission. 6. The home program has an opportunity to speak with the student when s/he attempts to get an advisor's signature on the Total Withdrawal form. 7. The Office of University Records updates the student's program in Banner upon process - ing of the Total Withdrawal form for the old program and the student's acceptance into the new program. aCademi C residen Ce A student must meet the residence requirements indicated for a particular degree or certificate. CataL og in e ffeCt for degree r eQUirements Subject to department approval, students may complete degree requirements outlined in any CATALOG in effect during the time they are en - rolled as accepted students in a school. However, students who have been on leave of absence for more than one year, or who failed to register with - out leave of absence (consult Office of the Dean regarding number of quarters) may be required to re-enter the program under the CATALOG in effect at the time of re-entry, with the exception of students who are on leave from a school to pursue a medical or dental degree at this University. Such students may complete their program under their original CATALOG. grad Uation The responsibility for meeting graduation requirements rests primarily upon the student. Therefore, students should read and understand the requirements as set forth in this CATALOG and consult carefully with their advisor to plan a sequence of courses each term that fulfills these requirements. A student's program of study is governed by the requirements listed in the Uni - versity CATALOG at the time of admission; how -ever, when circumstances demand, the University reserves the right to make changes with refer - ence to admission, registration, tuition and fees, attendance, curriculum requirements, conduct, academic standing, candidacy, and graduation. The undergraduate who plans to graduate must submit an \"Undergraduate Intent to Graduate\" form two quarters prior to graduation. The form is available online at <www.llu.edu/ssweb/ docu - ments/intgrad.pdf>.

The admis - sions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant quali - ties of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommen - dation of the program in which study is desired. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Allied Health Professions looks for evidence of self-discipline, personal integrity, and intellectual vigor. The committee also looks for evidence that students possess the capabilities required to complete the full curriculum in the allotted time and to achieve the levels of compe - tence required.

Candidates who complete the requirements for degrees and certificates are invited, with families and friends, to attend and participate in these important and colorful events. To be eligible to participate in graduation events, candidates must have completed all requirements for the degree, including prerequisites and/or corequisites, as specified by the school. In certain degree programs, upon authorization of the dean, exceptions will be made for candidates who: Have only clinical experience requirements to complete and can project completion by the end of the calendar year; Can complete remaining degree require - ments by the end of the Summer Quarter; or Are in a block program. The still in-progress course work may not exceed 8 units for graduate students or 12 units for under - graduate students. A student who completes the requirements for a degree or certificate (other than clinical experience) at the end of the Summer, Au - tumn, or Winter quarter is invited to participate in the subsequent June commencement events. The official date of graduation on the diploma is ordinarily the last day of the term in which the requirements for a degree are completed.

Zappia A student who has an interest in science, an investigative mind that enjoys the challenge of solving problems quickly and accurately, and a desire to help others should consider a career as a clinical laboratory scientist. Clinical laboratory scientists examine and analyze body fluids, tissues, and cells. They look for bacteria, parasites, or other microorganisms; analyze the chemical content of fluids; match blood for transfusions; and test for drug levels in the blood to show how a patient is responding to treatment. Clinical laboratory scientists perform complex chemical, biological, hematological, immunologic, microscopic, and bacteriologic tests. They use, maintain, and troubleshoot sophisticated labora - tory equipment that is used to perform diagnostic tests. The clinical laboratory scientist possesses the scientific and diagnostic skills required for DNA and biomolecular technology and genetic engineering applications, analyzes these test re - sults, and discusses them with the medical staff.oPP ort Unities Employment of clinical laboratory workers is ex - pected to parallel the growth of other health care occupations through the year 2014, particularly as the volume of laboratory tests increases with population growth and with the development of new technology. Employment opportunities are excellent, with current vacancy rates of 16 per - cent. The twenty-first century is offering clinical laboratory scientists new avenues for test develop - ment, experimental design, administration, and education. Clinical laboratory scientists work in hospitals or similar medical facilities, clinical and reference laboratories, home health diagnostics, transfusion services, physicians' offices, and pri - vate medical clinics. Employment is also available in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, health information systems, DNA technology and genetic engineering corporations, research labo - ratories, federal government agencies, forensics and crime investigation, veterinary hospitals, U.S. Public Health Service facilities, areas of medical product development, and customer and patient education. the Program The Clinical Laboratory Science Program is a two-year professional program that includes clini - cal training and culminates in a Bachelor of Sci - ence degree. Prerequisite courses may be taken at any accredited college or university and are com - pleted during the freshman and sophomore years. Accepted students transfer into the program at the junior year level, which begins in August dur - ing the postsummer session. After satisfactory completion of the program, the student is awarded a Bachelor of Science degree and is eligible to take the state and national board examinations and to become a licensed clinical laboratory scientist. The junior year is a ten-month program of lecture and laboratory. Emphasis is on the basic clinical science courses, including theory and cor - relations. The senior year is a ten-month clinical practicum that provides professional clinical experience in the hospital laboratory environment. Emphasis is on technical proficiency, application of theory to Clinical Laboratory Science\u2014AH 89 patient care, laboratory organization, and manage - rial skills. Senior students must coordinate their time with the operation of Loma Linda University Medical Center's clinical laboratory and with supplemental affiliate training laboratories in the community. CLiniCaL a ffiLiations Multiple clinical affiliations enrich the student's clinical training by providing exposure to pro - cedures in different types of medical facilities. During the forty-week clinical practicum, supple - mental training may be scheduled at any of the following clinical sites: Primary affiliation Loma Linda University Medical CenterLoma Linda, California supplemental affiliations LifeStreamSan Bernardino, California Community Hospital of San Bernardino San Bernardino, California Hoag Hospital Newport Beach, California Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center Loma Linda, California Kaiser Permanente Medical Center Fontana, California trans Portation to sChed ULed a ssignments Transportation to training laboratories is the responsibility of the student. Depending on the clinical assignment, commuting times may be up to two hours one way. Senior students must coordinate their time with the operational sched - ules of the Loma Linda University Medical Center Clinical Laboratory and affiliate laboratories in the community. The senior schedule is a full-time week (forty clock hours) arranged on a Monday through Friday, day shift schedule. On occasion, days or times outside of this typical schedule may be necessary to allow students exposure to unique procedures. A special calendar schedule, different from the University academic calendar, is fol - lowed. aCC reditation The program is accredited by the National Ac - crediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS), 5600 North River Road, Suite program also satisfies the requirements in medical technology of the American Society of Clinical Pathologists' Board of Registry for Medi - cal Technology, P .

MasangcayMarlene M. OtaMargaret A. TavaresPamela J. Wat Cytotechnology is a specialty within the broad field of clinical laboratory science. The cytotech - nologist, working under the direction of a patholo - gist, detects cell changes caused by different dis - ease processes and is able to differentiate between normal, atypical, and malignant cell changes. In recognizing microscopic abnormalities of cells and cellular patterns from various body sites, the cytotechnologist assists the pathologist in detect - ing cancer at its earliest and potentially most curable stage. As a result, physicians are able to diagnose and treat cancer long before discovering its existence by alternate methods.oPP ort Unities Cytotechnologists work in hospitals, clinics, and independent pathology laboratories. The employ - ment outlook for cytotechnologists is favorable, with the demand for trained workers exceeding the supply. Cytotechnologists can advance to supervisory positions, participate in research ac - tivities, or become teachers in the field. Advance - ment is based on experience, skill, and advanced education. the Program The Cytotechnology Program, based on the completion of two years of study at an accredited college or university, leads either to a certificate or to a certificate and a Bachelor of Science degree. The program of study begins with the Autumn Quarter. A certificate is awarded at the completion of the fourth quarter of study, and those electing to continue are awarded the Bachelor of Science degree upon the completion of an additional two quarters of study. With the certificate in cytotech - nology and the baccalaureate degree, the student is eligible to take a national examination and become a registered cytotechnologist. Registered Cytotechnology\u2014AH 109 cytotechnologists entering the program to receive the Bachelor of Science degree are considered to have completed, on the basis of registry, the equivalent course work listed in the first four quarters of the program. A total of 64 quarter units is applied toward the graduation require - ments, provided the course work in pathology is equivalent to that offered in the certificate pro - gram at this University. Where credit in pathology is not equivalent, the requirement may be met by taking AHCJ 402, 403 at this University; or by completing a minimum of 8 quarter units of upper division course work in developmental biology or comparative animal physiology at an accredited college or university. A writing validation examination will be admin - istered to all students. For those students achiev - ing a score of less than 4 on the Wholistic Writ - ing Score Sheet, remedial writing must be taken within the first academic year. Upon retest, the student must achieve a score of 4 or higher.

ChrispensDeborah CritchfieldNoha officioHealth care records are part of an integrated system of health information. The data provide a basis for patient care, quality assurance, legal de - fense, reimbursement, risk management, accredi - tation, planning, and decision making. Health information management has assumed increased importance with the advent of prospec - tive payment, health care privacy legislation, corporate compliance, and the electronic health record. A career in health information manage - ment is likely to appeal to a person who has organizational and leadership abilities and who is interested in and has aptitude for medical science, but whose talents are suited for participation other than physical involvement in human illness. The health information administrator (formerly known as medical record administrator) designs, develops, and maintains systems for storage, retrieval, and dissemination of information in ac - cordance with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. This person works with the medical staff and other health professionals in research, administrative studies, functions relative to health information, and patient-care evaluation. The health information administrator in a health care facility will provide management leadership in planning and organizing the department, moti - vating and evaluating employees, and providing in-service programs for departmental employees or other personnel in the facility. In addition, stra - tegic planning involvement for health information systems is an important function. Health Information Administration\u2014AH 125 oPP ort Unities While many health information administrators are employed in various areas of acute care facili - ties, others work in alternative delivery health care systems, research facilities, quality assur - ance, software-development companies, industrial establishments, government agencies, medical departments of insurance companies, account - ing firms, or as consultants to skilled nursing and other facilities. The multiplicity of new technologies, the advent of electronic health records, the demand for health information, the emphasis on evaluation of care, the surge in research, the emphasis on cost con - trol, and other factors combine to require compre - hensive knowledge and increased utilization of administrative talent and judgment. aCC reditation The Health Information Administration Program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Manage - ment Education (CAHIIM), 233 North Michigan Avenue, Suite 2150, Chicago, IL 60601-5519 stUdent Learning oU tComes Upon completion of the program, the graduate will be qualified to: 1.

Medical dosimetry is a dynamic, exciting field involving a combined knowledge of mathematics, physics, and the biological and medical sciences. Dosimetrists plan optimal isodose distributions and treatment dose calculations for a variety of ex - ternal beam as well as brachytherapy treatments. Medical dosimetrists must possess excellent ana - lytical skills, the ability to critically evaluate data, and an aptitude for physics and mathematics. They must also be able to work closely as a team with physicists, physicians, radiation therapists, and other personnel. Due to a lack of training programs in medical dosimetry throughout the United States, there is a shortage of medical dosimetrists in many areas of the country. This program aims to provide a sup - ply of well-trained dosimetrists who will be able to meet the needs of radiation oncology facilities in the local area and beyond.134 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Program o bJeCtives Upon completion of the program, the graduate should be qualified to: 1. Demonstrate ability to accurately complete dosimetric calculations and procedures as they pertain to all aspects of treatment plan - ning for external beam and brachytherapy. 2. Develop and define critical-thinking skills to enhance ability to analyze and compute dosimetric data as they relate to all aspects of radiation therapy treatment. 3. Exhibit professional behavior, which in - cludes ability to communicate with other professionals and work well, both individu - ally and as a team member. 4. Manage patients in an empathetic manner and exhibit basic patient care proficiencies. 5. Support the professional code of ethics and comply with the stated scope of practice. admission e dUCationaL baCKgro Und Students will either need to have: ARRT registration in radiation therapy technology, with a minimum of two years postgraduate clinical experience; or a baccalaureate degree in physics or math - ematics from an accredited university. Program d esign The length of the program will depend on the student's entering qualifications. For ARRT candi - dates, the program will be four quarters in length. For B.S. degree candidates, the program will be five quarters long. Instruction will include a mixture of lecture, laboratory, and clinical work. Students will be exposed to a variety of methodologies within dosimetry, including work with proton therapy treatment planning. All instruction will be conducted in the Radia - tion Medicine Department of Loma Linda Uni - versity Medical Center. The only exceptions to this will be a short clinical rotation to Long Beach Memorial and City of Hope medical centers. The program faculty consists of physicists and dosimetrists who are extremely experienced in their field\u2014many, in both photon and proton therapy treatment planning. aCC reditation The American Association of Medical Dosime - trists (AAMD) strongly supports the concept of formal dosimetry training, which leads to board eligibility for the certificate in medical dosimetry. This qualification is considered to be the gold standard in dosimetry education. The Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT) accreditation of dosimetry programs became available in 2003. As soon as regulations allow, application for accredi - tation will be made for this program.

Individuals and groups benefit from the work of the registered dietitian, which leads potentially to better health and longer life. Dietetic practice is the application of principles derived from integrating knowledge of food, nutrition, biochemistry, physiology, business and management, journalism, behavioral and social sciences, and the artistic presentation of food to achieve and maintain health, prevent disease, and facilitate recovery from illness. nUtrition and d ieteti Cs\u2014 Coordinated Program The coordinated program\u2014a joint effort of the School of Allied Health Professions and the School of Public Health\u2014offers students the option to pursue one of three degrees: B.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics M.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics M.P .H. degree in public health nutrition Nutrition and Dietetics\u2014AH 143 Each of these degrees culminates in eligibility to obtain a credential in dietetics, on which basis one can become a registered dietitian. The student obtains the credential in dietetics upon successful completion of the registration examination offered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration of the American Dietetic Association. The coordinated program in dietetics combines supervised profes - sional practice with the didactic curriculum to develop professional skills concurrently with cog - nitive and technical skills that enable the gradu - ate to establish eligibility to become a registered dietitian. b .s . degree in nutrition and dietetics The B.S. degree prepares entry-level dietitians to join the profession and contribute to the whole - ness of humankind.

This program comprises didactic and supervised professional practice experiences in an environment of liberal arts education to prepare an educated graduate. Admission to the profes - sional program at this University begins with the junior year of college. The applicant will present at least two years of education from an accred - ited college or university to meet specific subject requirements for the 2010-2011 academic year. In certain circumstances, admission to the program will be granted after one year of prerequisite work in the humanities, social sciences, and com - munication domains. The second year will focus on Loma Linda University campus courses in the sciences, including anatomy and physiology, chemistry, and microbiology. Continuation in the program for the third year will require mainte - nance of a G.P .A. of at least a 3.0. The seven-quarter professional program in - cludes theory, laboratory, research, and clinical experiences. Ten weeks of clinical experiences are scheduled at the end of the junior year and during the Spring Quarter of the senior year. Students participate as active members of the nutrition care team in multiple clinical settings. Administrative affiliation experiences involve decision-making as - signments in volume feeding operations in school food service or health care.m .s . degree in nutrition and dietetics The M.S. degree prepares entry-level dietitians to join the profession in areas of advanced prac - tice and in specialty areas that will allow them to contribute to the wholeness of humankind.

Students participate as active mem - bers of the nutrition care team in multiple clinical settings and may choose an emphasis in medical nutrition therapy or public health nutrition. Stu - dents choosing to earn the M.P .H. degree in public health nutrition should consult the Nutrition Program in the School of Public Health section of this Catalog. m .s . degree in nutrition and dietetics for d Pd graduates The M.S. degree for didactic programs in dietet - ics (DPD) is specifically designed for graduates who choose not to pursue a standard dietetic internship but who wish to complete a combined 144 UNIVERSITY CATALOG master's degree and supervised practice experi - ence in order to establish eligibility to write the registration examination for dietitians and be - come a registered dietitian.This program builds upon previous course work in nutrition and dietetics and culminates with an M.S. degree and a verification statement covering both didactic and supervised practice requirements. The prerequisite for this degree is a DPD verifica - tion statement. A G.P .A. of 3.0 or above and GRE scores are required. opportunities Members of the dietetics profession practice in a variety of environments\u2014including hospitals and other health care facilities, schools and universi - ties, government and community agencies, busi - ness, and industry. A growing number of dieti - tians are employed in physicians' offices, clinics, home health care agencies, mass communication, and many other entrepreneurial roles. By successfully passing the registration exami - nation for dietitians, practice opportunities as a specialist in medical nutrition therapy, admin - istrative dietetics, nutrition education, commu - nity nutrition, or research are available. There is increased recognition of the importance of nutri - tion in the fields of medicine, dentistry, and health promotion\u2014with emphasis on fitness and optimal well-being. This indicates that the dietitian's scope of practice is steadily broadening. The registered dietitian in medical nutrition therapy applies the science of nutrition to the care of people through health promotion and disease prevention, and uses medical nutrition therapy in the treatment of disease. The effective dietitian must be aware of the cultural, social, economic, aesthetic, and psychological factors that affect eating patterns. As a member of the patient-care team, the registered dietitian (RD) is responsible for assessing, implementing, and monitoring the nutritional care of patients. In addition, the RD may serve professionally as a nutrition practi - tioner in health care; a teacher in an educational institution; a research dietitian; or a nutrition consultant-educator in municipal, state, or federal departments of health. The RD in management is accountable for the food service system. In a health care institution, s/he is responsible for the effective functioning of food service from the standpoint of patients, administration, medical staff, and personnel. The administrative RD may also teach; manage food systems in educational, public, or commercial fa - cilities; serve as a consultant to health care or edu - cational institutions; or enter the field of research. Community registered dietitians practice in diverse settings, translating nutrition science into improved health status. Challenges may include forming partnerships with various organizations, mastering technology, enacting regulations and policies that protect and improve the public's health, and creatively managing scarce resources. Dietitians working in the community exhibit high-quality leadership and planning skills, and many create positions that are entrepreneurial as well as financially rewarding. accreditation The coordinated program in dietetics is currently granted continuing accreditation by the Commis - sion on Accreditation for Dietetics Education of the American Dietetic Association, 120 South Riv - erside Plaza, Suite 2000, IL 60606-6995, 312/899-5400.

Essential to the role of occupational therapy is an interest in the behavioral sciences and a concern for the individual's need to find proper adjust - ments to life's circumstances. A desire to teach and a background or interest in medical science are beneficial. Those inclined to mechanical or scientific techniques are suited to helping patients develop their capacities for employment. Others find that they can use their interests in creative arts, crafts, music, and teaching to work with dis - abled homemakers, children, and retired persons. oPP ort Unities Occupational therapists practice in general hospitals, rehabilitation centers, pediatric or psy - chiatric clinics, schools, skilled nursing facilities, home care, and outpatient community-centered programs (including hand rehabilitation, work evaluation, and adult day care facilities).

Goodacre, D.D.S., M.S.D.Dean, School of Dentistry 210 UNIVERSITY CATALOG School Foundations history A small but determined group of dentists met during the summer of 1943 in Grand Ledge, Michigan. Their purpose was to establish an orga - nization that would serve as a catalyst, urging the Seventh-day Adventist Church to sponsor a dental school where young adults could learn the dental profession in an environment consistent with their religious beliefs. These men were the founders of the National Association of Seventh-day Adventist Dentists (NASDAD). Under the leadership of Dr. J. Russell Mitchell, the organization's first president, the goal of a Christian dental school began taking conceptual form. NASDAD expanded in membership and objectives through men such as Dr. C. C. Ray, who toured the country on his own time in search of fellow Seventh-day Adventist dentists who were willing to pursue NASDAD's goals. Dr. M. Webster Prince served as president of NASDAD in 1948 and 1949. At a meeting in San Francisco in 1949, NASDAD members voted unanimously to support the dental school project. Later that year at a NASDAD session in Hinsdale, Illinois, the members pledged a strong financial base in support of their goals. The momentum of the effort became evident in the early 1950s. The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, under the guidance of President W. H. Branson, asked Dr. Prince to con - duct a feasibility study. Official action was taken in 1951 to authorize establishment of the School of Dentistry as a unit of Loma Linda University's School of Medicine. Dr. Prince was selected as the first dean of the School of Dentistry. His leader - ship in organizing and eventually administering the new School of Dentistry was facilitated by his prior experience as president of the Michigan Dental Association and as chair of the American Dental Association Council on Dental Education. Forty-two students comprised the inaugural class in the late fall of 1953. A dental hygiene curriculum leading to a Bache - lor of Science degree was developed in 1959 under the direction of Dr. Gerald A. Mitchell, chair of the Department of Periodontics. Violet Bates became chair of the new department, and the first class of ten dental hygienists graduated in 1961. In 1960 Dr. Charles T. Smith became dean. Dur - ing this period- the school experienced positive growth in many areas. A dental assisting curricu - lum was developed in 1968 under the leadership of Betty Zendner. The first class graduated in 1969, receiving the Associate in Science degree. A dental auxiliary utilization (DAU) program was initiated to provide enhanced learning for dental students. The Monument Valley Dental Clinic for Navajo Indians was started in 1966, and Dean Smith succeeded in finding from public sources fiscal support for the clinic building and for faculty housing. New advanced education (postdoctoral) programs were initiated in five clinical disciplines: orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodon - tics, and oral pathology. During the 1970s, the School of Dentistry contin - ued its evolution into one of the premier clinical programs in the United States. Dr. Judson Klooster became dean in 1971. One of his major contribu - tions was the expansion of Prince Hall, which was completed in May 1976. The new building more than doubled the number of clinical units; provided facilities for specialized areas of clini - cal instruction; and included eight new research laboratories, new classrooms, seminar rooms, amphitheaters, urgently needed teacher office space, and a commensurate expansion of support facilities and services. The Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic was remodeled, and an outpatient surgicenter was developed to meet the needs of those patients requiring general anesthesia for dental treatment. The School of Dentistry became an important regional resource for providing dental care for de - velopmentally disabled children and adults, many of whom require such a treatment setting. The Biomaterials Research Laboratory was construct - ed; and new advanced education programs were initiated in pediatric dentistry, implant dentistry, dental anesthesiology, and prosthodontics. A new program was established in 1985 to provide a U.S. dental education for foreign-trained dentists. An increasing number of dental professionals from other countries were seeking an American educa - tion and the opportunity to practice dentistry in the United States or to gain advanced knowledge Our Mission 211 to share in their own countries. The International Dentist Program continues to offer an intensive, twenty-one-month course of study leading to a D.D.S. degree. The program has added a six-month certificate program limited to dental missionar - ies from other countries who sense the need for updated continuing education. In 2000, the first major expansion of the School of Dentistry in more than twenty years added 15,000 square feet to Prince Hall on the east side and provided two new patient entrances. The expanded Special Care Dentistry Clinic and the enlarged Pediatric Dentistry Clinic were relo - cated to the ground floor. An additional student laboratory was also included on that level. On the second floor, the new space allowed for expansion of the predoctoral clinic, with thirty-six additional operatories. A preclinical laboratory was remodeled into a simulation laboratory in 2008. The laboratory in - cluded flat-panel monitors with access to the sub - stantial digital resource library created by faculty. In 2009, the Department of Orthodontics and the advanced education program moved into new fa - cilities designed as a model for providing student education and patient care in a digital world. The School of Dentistry continues to regularly expand the opportunities for enhanced student learning by improving physical facilities; making regular curricular modifications; and introduc - ing new interactive, navigable, nonlinear digital education programs. Our Mission Loma Linda University School of Dentistry seeks to further the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ wherein: Students learn to provide high-quality oral health care based on sound biologic prin - ciples. Patients receive competent care that is pre - ventive in purpose, comprehensive in scope, and provided with compassion and respect. Faculty, students, and staff value the patient relationship, respect diversity, and share responsibility by working together toward academic, professional, spiritual, and per - sonal growth. Scholarly activity and research provide a foundation for evidence-based learning and enhance whole-person care. The workplace environment attracts and re - tains a superior and diverse faculty and staff who motivate, educate, and serve. Our communities (local, global, and profes - sional) benefit from our service, stewardship, and commitment to lifelong learning.

This section of the CATALOG provides the general setting for the programs of the School of Dentistry and outlines the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. sPeCifiC Program reQUirements Information on the preceding pages pertains to general requirements governing all students. The student is reminded of individual responsibil - ity to be fully informed not only of these general requirements but also of the specific requirements in the following pages, which govern the curricu - lum of the chosen program. Programs and d egrees The School of Dentistry offers a comprehen - sive range of programs. Each of the school's five programs draws on the curricula of the various departments. 1. The undergraduate curriculum, the DENTAL HYGIENE program and the DENTAL HY - GIENE DEGREE COMPLETION program, leads to the Bachelor of Science degree and prepares the dental hygienist to enter a vari - ety of careers. Dental hygiene is a four-year college curriculum; the junior and senior years are taken in the Loma Linda University School of Dentistry. Pending approval from Loma Linda University Board of Trustees, WASC, and CODA, the ASSOCIATE IN SCI - ENCE DENTAL HYGIENE program will be available beginning Winter Quarter of 2011. This is a three-year college curriculum in which the first year prerequisites are taken at a regionally accredited college, and the remaining two years (a minimum of seven quarters) are taken at the Loma Linda Uni - versity School of Dentistry off-campus site. 2. The four-year professional curriculum, the GENERAL DENTISTRY program, leads to the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree and equips the general dentist to meet the needs of a diverse patient population. 3. THE INTERNATIONAL DENTIST program, a twenty-four-month (two academic years) curriculum, leads to a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from Loma Linda Univer - sity upon completion of the program. The program is designed for the dentist who has earned a dental degree outside the United States. 4. The ADV ANCED DENTAL EDUCATION programs lead to postdoctoral certificates in eight specialty and nonspecialty areas of dentistry and, at the student's option, addi - tionally to the Master of Science or a Master of Science in Dentistry degree. 5. The COMBINED DEGREES programs lead to a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree (through the School of Dentistry) earned concur - rently with a Master of Public Health degree (through the School of Public Health)\u2014D.D.S./M.P .H.; or to the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree (through the School of Den - tistry) earned concurrently with a Master of Science degree or Doctor of Philosophy degree\u2014D.D.S./M.S. or D.D.S./Ph.D. Combined d egrees Programs d .d .s . / m .

Preference is given to applicants who have completed or will complete the requirements for a baccalaureate de - gree prior to admission. A maximum of 64 semes - ter or 96 quarter units of credit may be accepted from an accredited junior or community college. A complete academic year of class work (8 semes - ter or 12 quarter units) in general biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, and general phys - ics is required. A complete sequence of freshman English that includes composition and literature (two semesters or two quarters). The biochemistry requirement is one semester or a minimum of 4 units; two quarters or a minimum of 6 units. All science prerequisites must be completed within five years prior to admission, with a grade of C or above in each course. A minimum grade-point av - erage of 2.7 in science subjects and in nonscience subjects, averaged separately, is required. The average grade-point average for accepted students is substantially higher. Students who are enrolled in another program 218 UNIVERSITY CATALOG in Loma Linda University are not considered for admission until they have completed or have been released from the program. Prior to consideration for admission, the ap - plicant must meet specific criteria related to past academic performance (G.P .A.), performance on the Dental Admission Test (DAT), and a personal interview. Applicants are expected to have taken the DAT within the previous two years, preferably not later than October of the year preceding ad - mission. At the applicant's request, test results are sent to the school by the testing service. Informa - tion may be obtained directly from the American Dental Education Association, 211 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611. An application form and descriptive material may be obtained from the school. In order to be better prepared with specific vo - cabulary and understanding, the applicant should include science courses with content similar to courses offered during the first year of the profes - sional curriculum. The applicant's purpose should be the pursuit of diverse knowledge, the cultiva - tion of an inquiring mind, the practice of efficient methods of study, and the habit of thinking and reasoning independently. These are of paramount importance to the applicant's development as a unique and responsible human being. The choice of electives can broaden the appli - cant's view of the scope of knowledge. Being well-read will give a perspective on the sweep of hu - man thought throughout the ages, and often this will be of assistance in written and verbal com - munication and will improve the ability to think and express oneself well. Psychological, social, philosophical, and religious insights will help to develop basic resources for the solution of person - al problems and the growth of self-understanding the student must have in order to understand and help associates. An applicant from a college or university outside the United States or Canada or from a nonaccred - ited college or university in the United States must complete a minimum of one full academic year (24 semester or 36 quarter credits) in competition with other preprofessional students in an accred - ited college or university in the United States. This includes the required specific core sciences in the areas of biology, organic and inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics (all sciences must in - clude laboratories). A grade of C or above in each course completed is required. (A grade of C- will not be accepted.) application procedure The school participates in the American Associa - tion of Dental Schools Application Service (AAD - SAS). Cards requesting an AADSAS application are available at most colleges and universities and also on the Internet at <www.adea.org>; or email at <aadsas@adea.org>. The application should be completed and returned to the Washington address indicated on the application. AADSAS processes this application and sends copies to the schools of the applicant's choice. The School of Dentistry at Loma Linda University recommends that applicants file their AADSAS application before August 1 in order to be competitive. To be given consideration for the next entering class, the student's application deadline is December 1. The following is a step-by-step process for completing an application to Loma Linda University (LLU). 1. AADSAS application. The Office of Admis - sions receives applications from AADSAS. 2. Supplementary application. The applicant then receives an email invitation from LLU to complete an electronic supplementary ap - plication. 3. Supplementary application deadline. The applicant must return the completed supple - mentary application and materials within thirty days. This includes an essay specific to Loma Linda University, a wallet-sized photo - graph, and the application fee of $75. 4. Transcripts. Official transcripts may be sent to AADSAS and then released by AADSAS to the School of Dentistry. When an applicant becomes an accepted student, official tran - scripts\u2014mailed directly from all colleges/universities\u2014are required in order for the student to be registered for the first quarter of classes. 5. References. The applicant is asked to supply a minimum of three personal references. It is recommended that these include an academic reference from a science instruc - General Information 219 tor; a reference from an employer; a char - acter or religious reference, such as from a minister; and a reference from a friend in the dental profession. If the applicant has attended a college or university that has a preprofessional committee that prepares a preprofessional evaluation, it is required that Loma Linda University be sent a copy of this evaluation from the committee. Members of the applicant's family are excluded from writing the required letters of reference, although letters will be accepted for the file in addition to those required. Recommenda - tion letters may be sent to AADSAS and then released by AADSAS to Loma Linda Univer - sity School of Dentistry. 6. Dental Admission Test. The applicant is required to complete and must meet specific criteria related to performance on the Dental Admission Test (DAT). Preference is given to applicants who have taken the test by Octo - ber of the academic year preceding that for which admission is desired. The student en - tering the first year is expected to have taken the test within the past two years. If the test has been taken more than one time, the most recent scores are used for admission crite - ria. The committee reviews all scores on the test. The DAT scores must be on file at Loma Linda University before an acceptance to the school will be issued. Test results should be sent to Loma Linda University, School of Dentistry, Office of Admissions. 7. Interview. The applicant's records will be screened when the supplementary applica - tion, recommendations, and transcripts are on file. The applicant may then be invited to the school for a personal interview. An inter - view is required for admission. The inter - view provides an opportunity for evaluation of noncognitive factors, including commu - nication skills, personal values, motivation, and commitment to goals of the profession; as well as genuine concern for others in the service of dentistry. At the time of the inter - view, a tour of the school will be given by a current student in the program. 8. Observation. It is important that preprofes - sional students seek experience observing and assisting in a dental office to become familiar with the work of a dentist. Prior to interviewing, applicants are expected to complete a minimum of twenty hours of observation/work experience in a dental fa - cility, ten of which must be done in a general practitioner's office. 9. Acceptance. The accepted student receives an acceptance letter and a follow-up letter with information relative to required forms and deposit deadlines. 10. Pre-entrance health requirements/Immuni - zations. It is expected that necessary routine dental and medical care will have been at - tended to before the student registers. New students are required to have certain immunizations and tests before registration. Forms to document the required immuniza - tions are provided for the physician in the acceptance packet sent to the student by the school. In order to avoid having a hold placed on registration, the student is encour - aged to return the documentation forms in the provided envelope to Student Health Service no later than six weeks prior to the beginning of classes. Students enrolling in the School of Den - tistry must provide documentation of having had the following immunizations and tests: MMRs\u2014measles (rubeola), mumps, ru - bella (German measles) (or provide proof of two previous MMRs) PPD (TB) skin test (current skin test result or x-ray report) Tetanus/Diphtheria booster Chicken pox blood test and/or immuni - zation. If no known history of chicken pox, then student may choose blood test (which may reveal pre-existing immu - nity) and/or immunization (if no prior immunity). Hepatitis-B vaccination series. Students who know themselves to have had hepatitis-B in the past should employ extra protection when involved in direct patient care and may request a modified curriculum, if necessary. This series of three vaccinations may be completed 220 UNIVERSITY CATALOG at this University (even if it was begun elsewhere) through the Student Health Service. (The student will be charged a fee.) A recent eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist For further information, consult the Stu - dent Handbook, Section V\u2014University Poli - cies\u2014Communicable disease transmission-prevention policy; or the Student Health Service office, 909/558-8770. If a returning student is assigned to a clini - cal facility that requires a tuberculosis skin test, the student is required to have the test within the six months before the assignment begins. 11. Deposits. The student accepted into dentistry must submit a deposit of $1,000 and the required forms to the Office of Admissions. All deposits become part of the first quarter's tuition. Failure to submit this deposit will result in the loss of the applicant's position in the class. The remaining balance of the first quarter's tuition and fees is due no later than the day of matriculation in late September. If the applicant has submitted a completed ap - plication for financial aid by March 2, and if the Stafford application has been submitted by June 15, the final installment can be paid utilizing University-assisted sources. 12. Financial requirement. Non-U.S. citizens and nonpermanent residents are required by U.S. immigration regulation to secure sufficient funds and pay for their first year's tuition and fees before they can register for Autumn Quarter. In addition, they must provide documentary evidence of sufficient funds for their second year. International students will receive the necessary visa applications and registration clearance after they have submit - ted their $1,000 deposit and payment plan. 13. Financial aid.

Student Life 225 Student Life sChoo L of d entistry teChni CaL s tandards In harmony with its own education, research, and service objectives, and using the American Dental Education Association suggested guide - lines, Loma Linda University School of Dentistry has identified technical standards for its pro - grams. The qualified applicant will meet, or will have the potential to meet, the following technical standards\u2014standards that every student in the dentistry programs is expected to reach. Cognitive abilities School of Dentistry students must have abili - ties that allow them to accurately and effectively measure, verify, calculate, reason, analyze, and synthesize. Students must be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to under - stand the spatial relationships of structures in or - der to fully and completely solve dental problems. In addition, students must be able to visualize and comprehend physical demonstrations in the class - room, laboratory, and clinic. Effective problem solving requires students to gather, organize, and assess relevant information in order to arrive at an integrated solution. observation For learning to occur, students will be required to observe and interpret demonstrations and expe - riences. Such observation requires the functional use of vision, touch, hearing, and somatic sensa - tion. Observation is further enhanced by the sense of smell. Students must be able to acquire information from written documents; and to visualize infor - mation presented in images from papers, films, slides, videos, or DVDs. They must be able to interpret radiographic and other graphic images, with or without the use of assistive devices. Stu - dents must be able to observe patients accurately, at a distance and close at hand. They must be able to observe and appreciate verbal and nonverbal communications when performing dental opera - tions or administering medications.All students in the School of Dentistry must pos - sess adequate visual and tactile skills to perform dental examinations and provide treatment. Visual acuity, accommodation, and color vision are necessary to discern differences and variations in color, shape, and general appearance between normal and abnormal hard and soft tissues. Touch and somatic sensation are required for effective learning, as well as for effective evaluation and treatment of patients. A student must also possess sufficient visual acuity to read electronic charts, records, small print, and handwritten notations. Communication Students in the School of Dentistry must be fluent in the use of standard written and spoken English. Thus students' communication with patients, faculty, and staff will be facilitated when eliciting or providing information; or when documenting changes in patients' mood, activity, and/or posture. Students must also be skilled in observing and understanding nonverbal com - munication. In addition, they must develop the professional judgment that will enable them to discern when and how to maintain patient confi - dentiality. motor skills School of Dentistry students should have suf - ficient motor and sensory capability in both hands to be able to provide general dental care. They must possess the motor and sensory capabilities to perform diagnostic procedures\u2014including such diagnostic maneuvers as palpation, percussion, and auscultation; and to perform basic laboratory tests. Exercising these capabilities requires coor - dination of both gross and fine muscular move - ments, equilibrium, and functional tactile and visual senses. Students must be able to operate foot controls, utilizing fine movements; and to operate high- or low-speed dental instruments, accurately per - forming movements of less than one-half millime - ter. They must also demonstrate well-developed tactile sense and precise control while using dental hand instruments.226 UNIVERSITY CATALOG behavioral and social attributes Students must be able to perform basic life sup - port (e.g., CPR), transfer and position disabled patients, and physically restrain patients who lack motor control. Additionally, they must be able to position or reposition themselves around the pa - tient and dental chair while sitting or standing. Students must possess the emotional stability and resilience required for full utilization of their abilities in the context of a full and challenging education program. Success in the educational program requires use of good judgment; prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients; and development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients, staff, and colleagues. It is also imperative that students be able to toler - ate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. Students must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, honesty, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, cultural sensitivity, and motivation are all per - sonal qualities that will be assessed during the admissions and education process. disabled applicants and students It is Loma Linda University's policy to comply fully with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sect. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The school is committed to providing dental edu - cation\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified ap - plicants who will be able to perform all technical standards with or without accommodations; and for whom such accommodation does not funda - mentally alter the School of Dentistry courses or create an undue burden. During the application process, the school re - quests that an applicant disclose any disability for which an accommodation may be needed. The Ad - missions Committee requires written documenta - tion of the disability, which they will review prior to making an assessment as to whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the essential functions of the program.A student who desires accommodation for any disability identified after admission must com - plete a request form available in the office of the associate dean for student affairs for evaluation with appropriate University entities. Appropriate and reasonable accommodation will be provided, as necessary. PoLiCies for this sC hoo L The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. Code of e thi Cs A school of dentistry is a place where the pro - fessionals of tomorrow are selected and trained in the development of professional and ethical standards that are consistent with the highest goals of the profession. It is for this purpose that the School of Dentistry has a code of ethics. This code is a means of educating and training the future dental professional in areas of ethical activ - ity, and a way of developing an ethical and moral awareness that will help professionals serve the public and the profession. The code of ethics of the School of Dentistry applies to all students in the school\u2014including dental hygiene, dentistry, international, graduate, and certificate students. In addition, residents, fellows, preceptors, re - search scholars, and exchange students involved in school programs shall also be subject to these school policies. The LLU School of Dentistry Code of Ethics is available for review in the School of Dentistry section of the LLU Student Handbook. stUdent a ssoC iation Membership in the Dental Students Association is open to all students. The objectives of the orga - nization include creating a common bond among Academic Information 227 students\u2014orienting them to the dental profession, encouraging and fostering community outreach activities, stimulating interest in current scientific development, providing programs of broad aca - demic scope, promoting students' various inter - ests, and providing social activities. sPeCiaL oPP ort Unities Conventions The annual Alumni-Student Convention, spon - sored since 1960 by the Alumni Association, gives opportunity for students to meet alumni and hear presentations by prominent guest lecturers in the dental profession. Students have the opportunity to make research presentations in the form of table clinics. The win - ners are then invited to present their table clinics at state and national conventions. dedication service A dedication service is held during the conven - tion, giving students an opportunity to dedicate their professional life to Christ. First-year students (D1) are presented with personalized Scriptures; graduating students are given personalized Loma Linda University laboratory coats. Academic Information genera L Po LiCies registration The student must register on or before the dates designated by the Office of University Records. Early registration is encouraged. Registration procedures are completed electronically at the myLLU registration portal <myllu.llu.edu>. Once at the portal, a student must clear registration holds (Student Health, transcript, housing) and clear finance. At the beginning of the first quar - ter of attendance, a student is required to have a picture taken for the student identification badge. International students must also register with the International Student Affairs office each quarter. Late registration is permissible only in case of a compelling reason; a charge is made if registra - tion is not completed by the designated dates. The student may not attend class without being registered, and in no case may registration take place later than the first week of the term. A change in registration after the second week af - fects the grade record. A student may not concur - rently register for courses in another school of the University without permission from the executive associate dean. attendance Regular attendance at lectures, clinics, and other assemblies is required of all students. All lectures and laboratories provide information essential for successful completion of the program. Each student is responsible for all material covered and assignments made. Absences in excess of 15 percent may be sufficient cause for a failing or unsatisfactory grade to be recorded. Clinics and individual courses/instructors may have more stringent requirements. Length of academic residence To fulfill the requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, the student must be regis - tered for a full course load at the University for the entire senior year for the Bachelor of Science degree; and the entire third (D3) and fourth (D4) years for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. dean's list Outstanding academic performance will be rewarded by publication of the Dean's List each quarter. The eligibility requirements are: Complete at least 12 units of graded course work during the quarter; Achieve a term grade-point average of at least 3.5 with no grade lower than a B-; Receive no incomplete grades on the grade report.228 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Course waiver A course requirement may be waived if the applicant has previously taken the course and earned a grade of B or above, but no credit results. Evaluation for waiver of courses will be completed only after an applicant has been accepted to the program, and must be approved by the course di - rector at this University and the school's executive associate dean. Tuition is not reduced if courses are waived or if a student takes less than a full load. special examination It is the policy of the school that all students are expected to take examinations at the scheduled time. The only acceptable excuse for not taking an examination on time is major illness (documented by the Student Health Service and conveyed to the course director and the Office of Student Affairs prior to the examination). The consequences of missing an examination under the circumstances of documented illness are determined by the course director. If a student appears late for an examination, s/he may be denied admission to the examination site. If a student arrives late for an ex - amination and is allowed to take the examination, s/he will be required to finish the examination at the same time as students who arrive on time. repeating/remediating a course (predoctoral, id P and dental hygiene students) If a student receives an unsatisfactory or failing grade in a required course, it will be necessary for him/her to do additional work. Based on the origi - nal grade earned by the student, and upon the recommendation of the Academic Review Com - mittee, one of the following plans will be pursued: 1. For courses with unsatisfactory performance (D+/D/U grades) the student must reregis - ter for the course, review the course work independently, repeat required assignments or quizzes, and take any or all course exami - nations as required by the course director. The highest grade allowed for a remediated course is C. At the discretion of the Academ - ic Review Committee and course director, the student may be required to repeat the course at the next course offering. 2. For courses with failing performance (F grades), the student must reregister for the course, attend the class and/or laboratory, and take all course examinations at the next regular course offering. 3. Both the original and repeat grades are en - tered into the student's permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade units are computed in the grade point average. aCademi C Criteria for Promotion academic criteria for academic advancement and program completion Predo Ctora L Level d1 to Level d 2 Cumulative didactic and preclinical labora - tory G.P .A. at or above 2.0.

The National Board examinations are designed to assess cognitive knowledge of the basic, behavioral, and clinical sciences. Eligibility to sit for either part of the National Board Examination is determined by successful completion of the curriculum leading up to the examination. In addition, students are required to pass a comprehensive examination that assesses mastery of the test specifications prior to each National Board Examination. The eligibility requirements and timetable for passing the National Board Examination are stated below: Part i first attem Pt Scheduled during June or July following comple - tion of the second year. If a student fails the examination, s/he will have her/his scheduled clinic time substantially reduced. During this time, students will be required to study for a re-examination no later than December. seCond attem Pt If a student does not successfully complete the second attempt of the Part I examination by the end of Autumn Quarter, s/he will be required to take a two-quarter leave of absence to prepare for re-examination the succeeding Summer Quarter. Academic Information 231 third attem Pt After taking the re-examination in the succeed - ing Summer Quarter, the student will be allowed to work on the clinic until examination results are received. If the student successfully completes the Part I examination, s/he will continue to work on the clinic for the Summer and Autumn quarters and will begin didactic courses again during the Winter Quarter with the current third-year stu - dents. If the student does not successfully com - plete the National Board Examination Part I on the third attempt, s/he will be discontinued from the program. Part ii first attem Pt Scheduled in December of the fourth year. If the examination is not successfully completed, access to the clinic will be restricted in order to provide additional time for study. The student will be given an opportunity to retake the examination in the following Spring Quarter. National Board Examination policy requires subsequent attempts to be at least ninety days apart. If a student fails the Part II examination, s/he will not be permitted to participate in licensure examinations. seCond attem Pt A student who fails the Part II examination a second time will be required to take a leave of ab - sence to prepare for a re-examination. A candidate for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree must have successfully completed Parts I and II of the Na - tional Board Examination before being awarded the D.D.S. degree. ProC toraL , idP and dentaL committees: D1, D2, D3, D4, IDP , and Dental Hygiene. Membership of each committee consists of the executive associ - ate dean, the associate dean for student affairs, the associate dean for admissions, and the course directors of all courses required of the respective class in the academic year. The associate dean for clinic administration and primary attending fac - ulty are members of the D3/D4 academic review committees. In addition, each committee has two student members appointed by the dean in con - sultation with the DSA officers. Student committee members will be in the class one year ahead of the class being reviewed. The academic review committees meet once per quarter to evaluate student academic and clini - cal performance and progress records. Students whose performance does not meet the stated academic standards and students who are being considered for discontinuation may be scheduled for a hearing with the committee. The committee also recommends to the dean all appropriate candidates for promotion, academic probation, repeat, or other appropriate actions; as well as students who should receive special recog - nition for academic excellence. The process for evaluation of academic perfor - mance is as follows: 1. The academic review committee\u2014by re - viewing grades, reports, and other pertinent information\u2014identifies students whose aca - demic and/or clinical performance is below acceptable levels. 2. The associate dean for student affairs notifies a student facing possible academic sanctions regarding the time and place for a hearing called for the purpose of allowing the stu - dent to appear before the committee to pres - ent reasons why action should not be taken. The academic review committee considers the student's presentation and all available information before making a recommenda - tion. 3. The dean may enforce one or more of four academic sanction options:\u2014 Academic probation Remedial action Academic leave of absence Academic discontinuation Please refer to Academic Disciplinary Policy for more specific descriptions regard - ing each academic sanction. 4. A student may appeal the decision of the ac -232 UNIVERSITY CATALOG ademic review committee to the dean. Such appeals are not expected to be routine and should be considered only in circumstances where new and relevant information exists that was not available for consideration by the academic review committee. The dean will review the matter and either render a decision or appoint a three-member ad hoc committee. Members of this committee will not have been involved in the academic re - view committee decision process. The ad hoc committee will determine whether the pro - cess was appropriately followed, review new information, and judge whether the record supports the decision. They will report their findings and recommendation to the dean, who will decide if the appealing student will be permitted to continue participating in classes and/or clinical assignments during the appeal proceedings. aCademi C disCiPLinary PoLiCy for PredoC toraL , idP, and d enta L hygiene stUdents academic probation Academic probation is a specified period of time during which the student is given an opportunity to comply with specific academic standards. Such action must be confirmed by letter to the student. Criteria for PL aCement on a Cademi C Probation A student will be placed on academic probation if s/he meets one or more of the following condi - tions: 1. Term or cumulative grade-point average (G.P .A.) below 2.0. 2. Failing (U/F) or unsatisfactory (D+/D) grades in any course required for the degree. 3. Clinical performance below minimum ex - pected for current academic level. 4. Social/behavioral/ethical problems that significantly impact academic and/or clinical performance.Leve L of a Cademi C Probation The level of academic probation indicates the seriousness of the cumulative academic deficiency. However, depending on the seriousness or nature of the academic deficiency, a student may be con - sidered for academic leave of absence or discon - tinuation at any level of probation. Level I First term on academic probation. Level II Second term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term or failure to reregister in the succeeding quarter. Level III Third term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. If a student is unable to remove academic probationary status within the following term, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term or failure to reregister in the succeeding quarter. Level IV If a student meets the criteria for academic probation for a fourth term, consecutive or nonconsecutive, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. Clinic probation (predoctoral) stUdent in good CL iniC standing The student who meets attendance requirements, clinic point requirements, and requirements as defined by the clinical departments in the School of Dentistry shall receive a \"Satisfactory\" (S) grade for the quarter. CLiniC Probation Leve L i (CP i) A student who meets one or more of the follow - ing criteria: Academic Information 233 1. Fails to meet the attendance requirement. 2. Fails to meet the published minimum clinic point requirement. 3. Fails to achieve the standards of care expect - ed in the quality of patient treatment. 4. Fails to meet the requirements defined by the clinical departments in the School of Dentistry. A student on CPI will receive a \"Marginal Satis - factory\" (MS) grade and will be required to attend Friday afternoon clinic sessions for the following quarter. The student on CPI will not be eligible for honors programs during the time s/he is on pro - bation. The student is notified in writing of his/her probation status. If a student, while on CPI, meets the attendance requirements, achieves the overall minimum clinic point requirement at the end of the remedial quarter, improves the quality of patient treatment as needed, and completes all requirements as defined by the clinical departments, s/he returns to \"good standing\" status and will not be required to attend the Friday afternoon clinic sessions the following quarter. CLiniC Probation Leve L ii (CP ii) A student who, while on Clinic Probation Level I, meets one or more of the following criteria: 1. Fails to meet the attendance requirement. 2. Falls more than 200 points below the mini - mum points required for the remedial quar - ter. 3. Fails to achieve the standards of care expect - ed in the quality of patient care. 4. Fails to complete requirements defined by the clinical departments in the School of Dentistry. A student on CPII will receive an \"Unsatisfac - tory\" (U) grade, reregister for the SDCL course for which s/he received the \"U\" grade, and continue to attend Friday afternoon clinic sessions. A student on CPII will not be eligible for honors programs. The student on CPII will have one quarter to meet the attendance requirement, finish the quarter with fewer than 200 points below the requirement, meet the standard of care expected in the quality of patient care, and complete all re - quirements as defined by the clinical departments in the School of Dentistry. If a student, while on CPII, meets the attendance requirement, improves the quality of patient care, completes the requirements defined by the clinical departments of the School of Dentistry, and fin - ishes the quarter with fewer than 200 points below the minimum, s/he will return to CPI. The student can eventually work back to good standing. CLiniC Probation Leve L iii (CP iii) A student who, while on CPII, meets one or more of the following criteria: 1. Completes the remedial quarter more than 200 points below the minimum. 2. Fails to meet the attendance requirement. 3. Fails to achieve the standards of care expect - ed in the quality of patient care. 4. Fails to complete requirements defined by the clinical departments in the School of Dentistry during the remedial quarter. Clinic Probation Level 3 requires the academic review committee to consider discontinuing the student or to require him/her to repeat one academic year. If the academic review commit - tee votes to require a student to repeat a year, the student will join the next graduating class at that point in the academic calendar. The academic review committee will determine which courses (if any) the student must repeat. When a student is required to repeat one year, s/he immediately returns to \"good standing\" status. restrictions for a student on academic probation A student on academic probation: 1. May not serve as an officer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2. May not take any elective courses. 3. May not participate in any elective off-cam - pus service learning or mission activities. 4.

Counseling, tutoring, and/or repeating as - signments or course work; or completing additional assignments or course work, pos - sibly including repeating an academic year or portion thereof. 2. Other specified requirements. academic leave of absence Academic leave of absence is a specified period of time during which the student is withdrawn from the academic program. Upon request to and approval by the academic review committee, the student may return to the program at a year/term level specified by the committee. The student may be requested to fulfill specific requirements prior to re-entering the academic program. The following guidelines pertain to when an academic leave of absence may be considered for a student who is in one or more of the following situations: Student has a serious academic deficit which cannot be removed while continuing with current course work. At the end of the academic year, student does not meet the criteria for promotion to the next academic year. Student has three consecutive quarters on academic probation. Student has not passed the National Board Examination on schedule after two attempts and needs full study time to prepare for the National Board Examination. Student fulfills criteria for academic discon - tinuation yet shows promise for future suc - cess despite current deficiencies. Return from an academic leave of absence re - quires that the student reapply for admission by written request to the executive associate dean. The student must meet the requirements for read - mission specified by the academic review commit - tee at the time the leave of absence was granted. The requirements for readmission may also be reviewed by the academic review committee. academic discontinuation Guidelines for academic discontinuation are in - dicated below for the predoctoral, IDP and dental hygiene students: d1 y ear Any term with one or more failing grades, regardless of term or cumulative G.P .A.

Discontinuation\u2014by the associate dean for advanced education or upon the recommen - dation of the program director recommend - ed to the dean. Probation All recommendations to the associate dean for advanced education must be supported by well-documented evidence of repeated counseling and other internal measures designed to point out deficiencies and take corrective action through a detailed remediation program. A remediation program must be specific in design, implemented, and monitored for any student/resident who is not performing up to a program's stated standards. It is important to have documentary evidence on record by multiple faculty members with detailed accounts of dates, times, explanations of counsel - ing, discussions, and corrective measures. Writ - ten statements from support staff should also be included if they have direct contact or knowledge of a matter involving a postdoctoral student/resi - dent. Postdoctoral students/residents may be placed on academic probation, behavioral probation, and clinical probation. Probation begins at Level I and may progress to Level III. Postdoctoral students/residents should be placed on probation for a prescribed period of time: one quarter, two quar - ters, etc. This information should be conveyed to a student/resident in writing (required) and also verbally (recommended). Continuation Students who are not progressing as expected may be continued in their year group for as long as necessary before being promoted to the next year or discontinued. To exercise this option, the associate dean for advanced education must inform University Records of the decision to con - tinue a student/resident and state the anticipated length of that continuation. Program directors make the determination as to when to recommend continuing a student and when to recommend dis - continuing a student/resident and allow him/her to graduate or continue their studies. Invariably, the length of the continuation period will deter - mine when a student/resident actually completes his/her program. discontinuation Students who do not make any measurable im - provement by the end of the prescribed remedia - tion and counseling periods may be recommend - ed for discontinuation by the associate dean for advanced education or upon the recommendation of the respective program director to the associate Academic Information 239 dean for advanced dental education. Recommen - dations to discontinue a student/resident are then sent to the dean (in writing) for action. Criteria for discontinuation Three or more unsatisfactory or failing grades within the academic year, regardless of term or cumulative G.P .A. Three consecutive quarters of academic probation. Failure to fulfill terms of academic probation within the specified time period. Failure to achieve eligibility for award of a certificate in the clinical specialty program within the standard number of full academic years. servi Ce-Learning Service-learning at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry continues the original purpose of the school\u2014to train dental health professionals to provide service to underserved populations, both locally and abroad. Field experience for students of dentistry and dental hygiene includes extramural opportuni - ties within the U.S. and in foreign countries. In addition to providing clinical treatment, service-learning experiences include local health fairs and elementary school dental health presentations. Service experiences may last from one day to several weeks. All students are required to complete assigned service-learning rotations and minimum clock hours, as described in each program. Predoctoral dental students are required to complete a mini - mum of 120 service-learning hours. Forty hours must be completed doing local community service dentistry. Up to 30 of the remaining 80 hours may be completed doing nondental service. Dental hy - giene students must complete 75 service-learning hours. Thirty-five hours of local service are re - quired, and up to 15 nondental service hours may be credited. The International Dentist Program students must complete 60 hours of service. Of the 60 hours, 40 will be assigned by the program. Up to 10 hours of nondental service may be completed as part of the 60 hours total requirement.Students are required to be in good and regular standing to be eligible to participate in elective international service-learning experiences. Learning environment Because the study of dental sciences and arts is based on a foundation in essentially the same science subjects as are studied in medicine and allied health curricula, the School of Dentistry shares with the School of Medicine the facilities for teaching basic sciences. Classrooms, laboratories, student lounges, teach - ers' offices, and clinical facilities related solely to dentistry occupy the School of Dentistry building, named in honor of M. Webster Prince, the first dean. Prince Hall is on the University mall facing the University Church and adjacent to the Medi - cal Center. The facilities effectively accommodate collaboration with the Medical Center in ongoing research and service programs. The total resources of the University constitute a wealth of opportunity for the student with initia - tive and willingness to develop individual capaci - ty to the fullest extent. Students find varied oppor - tunities for serving and learning in the immediate University community, in school-sponsored service-learning clinics, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs. basiC sC ienCes The Loma Linda University departments of basic sciences include anatomy, biochemistry, microbiol - ogy, and physiology and pharmacology. The basic sciences serve as the foundation for the dental sciences by leading toward an understanding of normal structure and function, as well as intro - ducing the basis for pathology in the practice of dentistry. Subjects are taught in the first year of the den - tal hygiene and the first two years of the general dentistry curricula as part of three conceptually integrated sequences of courses\u2014sequences in physiology, in anatomy, and in applied science. Throughout the basic sciences, an appreciation of God's creation and His wisdom is reinforced through the study of human biology. Students are encouraged to extend their knowledge and apply 240 UNIVERSITY CATALOG it for their own well-being and for the well-being of their patients. The purpose of the basic science curriculum is to provide a foundation of knowledge that is essential for the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene. The faculty are dedicated to providing students with tools that expand their thinking and challenge them to ask probing questions and to earnestly search for answers. Their aim is to prepare students to excel scientifically. The higher aim is, through the Christian atmosphere of this University, to prepare students to become truly compassionate dentists. Financial Information finan CiaL Po LiCies The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any excep - tions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty mem - bers, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the School or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; there - fore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions warrant. genera L finan CiaL Pra CtiCes The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the begin - ning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or this University must have been settled. satisfactory a cademic Progress Policy (all programs) To be eligible for federal, state, and university financial aid, students are required by the U.S. Department of Education and the state of Califor - nia to maintain satisfactory progress toward their degree objectives. In compliance with prescribed regulations, the University and School of Dentist - ry have established guidelines that are designed to ensure that students successfully complete courses to promote timely advancement toward a specific degree objective. definition of satisfa Ctory a Cademi C Progress The School of Dentistry defines satisfactory aca - demic progress by the following three criteria: 1. Meeting a minimum grade-point average requirement. 2. Making yearly progress by completing the academic requirements defined for a pro - gram. 3. Completing the degree objective within the maximum time allowed. grade P oint-average re QUirement To maintain satisfactory academic progress, stu - dents in the dental and dental hygiene programs must maintain a minimum cumulative grade-point average of 2.0. In addition, dental hygiene students must achieve no lower than a C- grade in all core courses. year Ly Progress re QUirement Each student's academic progress is evaluated by the academic review committee at the end of each academic term, and a cumulative review is conducted to determine eligibility for promotion at the end of each academic year. The Office of Academic Affairs monitors the minimum grade-point average requirement. The Financial Aid Office monitors yearly progress and the maximum time allowance. Students whose academic standing or degree progress falls below the standard receive a financial aid warning during the next quarter of registration. If their academic standing or degree progress is not raised to the standard by the end Financial Information 241 of the quarter in which the financial aid warning was issued, all financial aid will be terminated for these students until the requirements have been met. reasonab Le degree P rogress It is expected that students will complete the requirements for a degree within the scheduled curriculum time for the degree. The Doctor of Dental Surgery degree is scheduled to be com - pleted in four years and may not exceed six years. The Bachelor of Science degree in dental hygiene is scheduled to be completed in two years in the professional curriculum and may not exceed three years.

GOODACRE, Dean, School of Dentistry The goal of the General Dentistry Program is to train practitioners in the delivery of high-quality dental care that is preventive in purpose and com - prehensive in scope, and that is based on sound biological principles. CUrriCULU m Dentistry, like all health professions, exists to benefit society and, therefore, continually assesses its professional services to ascertain what mea - sures, attitudes, and skills most effectively serve society. The School of Dentistry is committed to: Beginning the curriculum with a strong foundation in the sciences that are basic to knowledge of the structure and function of the human being in health and in sickness. Providing an educational environment that progressively leads a student to mastery and correlation of clinical sciences and skills. Developing a frame of reference from which to mobilize the resources of dentists and associated professional personnel in both delivery of health care and contribution to community well-being by education for the prevention of illness. These concepts include responsibility for contrib - uting to the body of scientific knowledge by ques -tioning, investigating, and teaching; for remaining sensitive and adaptive to the needs of humanity in ever-changing conditions; and for maintaining consciousness of the individual obligation to live, practice, and strive for the good of humanity. The curriculum in dentistry, organized to be completed in four academic years, fulfills require - ments for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. obJeCtive The primary objective of the dental curriculum is to graduate men and women who attest to the purpose of the University and the goals of the School of Dentistry, which include advancing knowledge and understanding of health, disease, and ways to improve health and the dental health care-delivery system through basic and applied research. admission Information and procedures for applying to the Doctor of Dental Surgery Program can be found under Application and Admissions in the School of Dentistry general information in Section III of this CATALOG. regULations The student is also subject to the conditions of registration, attendance, financial policy, gov - erning practices, and graduation requirements outlined in Section II and in the School of Den -248 UNIVERSITY CATALOG tistry general information in Section III of this CATALOG. instr Uments, t extboo Ks, additiona L m ateriaL s The instruments, textbooks, and materials re - quired for the study and practice of dentistry are prescribed by the School of Dentistry.

Leslie Arnett, Jr.Jeffrey The Department of Periodontics provides educa - tion and training for predoctoral, dental hygiene, and postgraduate students in the art and science of periodontics. Periodontics encompasses the study of the supporting structures of the teeth; as well as the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that affect the supporting structures of the teeth. The study of periodontics helps to form basic concepts of health and disease. These concepts are applied in the treatment of periodontal diseases and in the maintenance of dental health over a patient's lifetime, providing comprehensive dental therapy for the individual patient. In this way, the Department of Periodon - tics contributes directly to the School of Dentist - ry's academic and service mission \"to make man whole.\" CoUrses Units IDPP 754 Clinical Periodontics 2.0 IDPP 759 Special Topics in 2.0 PERI 705 Introduction to Periodontics 2.0 PERI 741 Essential Periodontal Therapy, Lecture 2.0 PERI 742 Essential Periodontal Therapy, Laboratory (two quarters) 2.0 PERI 765 Special Topics in Periodontal Therapy 2.0 PERI 805 Periodontal Surgical Therapy 1.0 PERI 875 Periodontics Clinic (four quarters/7.5 units required) 1.0-7.5 restorative d entistry DOUGLASS B.

WILKINS, Chair MICHELLE T. HURLBUTT, Interim Director, Degree Completion Program JANEEN C. DUFF, Director, A.S. Degree Program faCUL ty Darlene A. ArmstrongKellie R. A. StephensKristi J. WilkinsColleen A. Whitt Established in 1959, the Department of Dental Hygiene, the Bachelor of Science degree under - graduate program of the School of Dentistry, is largely focused on preventive oral health services and continuing care. Dental science courses, pre - clinical lectures and seminars, laboratory exercis - es, and clinical assignments have been developed to provide training in the variety of procedures delegated to the dental hygienist within the dental practice setting. These experiences are sequenced in an organized manner that provides for contin - ual growth and competency in performance of all traditional and expanded function procedures. Dental Hygiene\u2014SD 267 The purpose of the program is to develop profes - sionals prepared for the current practice of dental hygiene, as well as graduates who are additionally prepared to deal with future changes in dentistry. Courses that encourage critical thinking and problem-solving techniques and that enhance the ability to evaluate the latest in research are impor - tant adjuncts to clinical training. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be prepared to enter a variety of career options available to a dental hygienist. The Degree Completion Program is designed for licensed dental hygienists who graduated from an Associate in Science degree program, or its equivalent, and wish to complete the baccalaure - ate (B.S.) degree in dental hygiene. This program is the equivalent of one full academic year. In addition to the degree completion courses in either education or public health, the student will need to complete any remaining general educa - tion requirements needed to fulfill a baccalaureate degree. The Degree Completion Program is designed to be completed primarily online, with a requisite teaching or public health component that may be accomplished in the geographical area of the student. This program offers the challenge and quality of a traditional classroom, yet provides the flexibility to fit education into the life of the busy dental professional. Students can study at their own convenience, learn in small groups with expert faculty, and meet career goals at their own speed. Students who tend to be the most success - ful in this type of program are self-directed, com - puter literate, and self-motivated in their learning and study habits. Two areas of focus are included in this program. The first is teaching and prepares the student to instruct in a dental hygiene program. The second is a public health focus, which will allow gradu - ates to work in a community/ dental public health program or will enable them to teach in a dental hygiene program. The Associate in Science (A.S.) degree dental hygiene program, established in 2010, is designed to be completed at the School of Dentistry off-campus location in Palm Desert, California. The goal of the A.S. program is to offer a unique edu - cational opportunity for students in the Coachella Valley. Applicants who live in the Coachella Valley and have completed prerequisite course work at the College of the Desert will be given prior - ity review in the School of Dentistry Admissions process. The purpose of the A.S. degree program, mod - eled after the B.S. degree dental hygiene program established in 1959, is to increase access to care in an area underserved by preventive oral health care providers. Upon completion of this curricu - lum, graduates will be prepared to enter clinical practice under the general and direct supervision of a licensed dentist. The A.S. degree graduate will be encouraged to pursue the B.S. degree online completion program, preparing them for a variety of career options, including teaching and public health opportunities. Loma Linda University emphasizes Christian values and beliefs and the concept of whole-person care. Opportunities for spiritual growth and fellowship among faculty and students are interwoven into daily academic pursuits, clinical practice, and social interactions. The A.S. degree program is pending approval by Loma Linda University Board of Trustees, Western Association of Schools and Colleges, and the Com - mission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. PhiLoso Phy A profession in the health arts and sciences calls increasingly for persons of intelligence, integ - rity, responsibility, and depth of human under - standing. Therefore, the program of instruction is planned on a strong liberal arts foundation. The student is encouraged to take electives that contribute to breadth of knowledge and quality of values. The choice of electives in early college work is important for many reasons. The School of Dentistry is interested in appli - cants with the potential to become hygienists who are well-read and caring persons prepared to communicate effectively in professional and community relationships. They should be able to draw on knowledge of the structure and function of the human body in health and disease, apply - ing resources based on Christian ideals and values to aid in the solution of personal problems. They should also be able to develop the attitudes and skills that will most effectively serve society.268 UNIVERSITY CATALOG goaL The goal of the Dental Hygiene Program is to educate competent, concerned, and active mem - bers of the dental hygiene profession who possess the ability to effectively perform the expanding scope of practice of the dental hygienist. Loma Linda University emphasizes Christian values and beliefs and the concept of whole-person care. Opportunities for spiritual growth and fellowship among faculty and students are interwoven into daily academic pursuits, clinical practice, and social interactions. The advancement of dental hygiene depends on an ever-growing body of knowledge. Therefore, this program also places great importance on providing an atmosphere in which students can develop the skills necessary to objectively assess new theories and trends in dentistry in light of scientific knowledge and principles. By combin - ing Christian values with an appreciation for research and the scientific method, graduates will continually apply evidence-based principles to patient care and exhibit God's love in the quality of service they render. admission Information and procedures for applying to the Dental Hygiene Program can be found under the Application and Admissions section of the general information for the School of Dentistry in Section III.CUrriCULU m Dental hygiene, a profession dating back to 1913, is largely concerned with preventive health services. The hygienist works in association with the dentist in private practice offices, industrial organizations, schools, hospitals, state or federal public health services, and the armed forces. The B.S. degree curriculum is organized as a four-year college program. The freshman and sophomore years of largely prescribed, preprofes - sional study may be taken at any regionally ac - credited college. The professional program begins with the junior year in the School of Dentistry. The program is approved by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental As - sociation. The first class at this University gradu - ated in 1961. After completion of the required prerequisite course work, the A.S. degree dental hygiene stu - dent enters the seven-quarter program leading to the Associate in Science degree in dental hygiene. The student will meet eligibility in the sixth quar - ter, after successful completion of course work, for the written Dental Hygiene National Board Examination. After successful completion of the seventh quarter, the graduate will be eligible to sit for a state and/or regional clinical board examina - tion. denta L hygiene\u2014 a .s . soPhomore y ear, Winter Q Uarter CLoCK h oUrs tota L Units Lec/Sem Lab Clin Total ANAT 301 Head and Neck Anatomy, DH 40 \u2014 \u2014 40 4.0 DNHY 216 Oral Health and Preventive Dentistry 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 305 Oral Anatomy Lecture 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 305L Oral Anatomy Laboratory \u2014 44 \u2014 44 1.0 DNHY 321 Preclinical Dental Hygiene I Lecture 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 321L Preclinical Dental Hygiene I Laboratory \u2014 88 \u2014 88 2.0 Totals 106 132 \u2014 238 13.0 sPring Q Uarter CLoCK h oUrs tota L Units Lec/Sem Lab Clin Total ANAT 303 General and Oral Histology and Embryology 30 \u2014 \u2014 30 3.0 Dental Dental 55 4.0 DNHY 309 Radiology I 33 28 \u2014 61 3.0 DNHY 322 Preclinical Dental Hygiene II Lecture 20 \u2014 \u2014 20 2.0 DNHY 322L Preclinical Dental Hygiene II Laboratory \u2014 44 \u2014 44 2.0 DNHY 375 Dental Hygiene Clinic \u2014 \u2014 30 30 1.0 RELT 423 Loma Linda Perspectives 20 \u2014 \u2014 20 2.0 Totals 144 86 30 260 17.0 sUmmer Q Uarter CLoCK h oUrs tota L Units Lec/Sem Lab Clin Total DNHY 310 Radiology II 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 323 Preclinical Dental Hygiene III 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 323L Preclinical Laboratory \u2014 40 \u2014 40 1.0 DNHY 376 Dental Hygiene Clinic \u2014 \u2014 120 120 4.0 DNHY 380 Medically Compromised Patients 20 \u2014 \u2014 20 2.0 DNHY 381 Pharmacology for the Dental Hygienist I 44 \u2014 \u2014 44 2.0 ODRP 311 General and Oral Pathology DH 50 \u2014 \u2014 50 5.0 Totals 158 40 120 318 18.0 JUnior y ear, aU tUmn Q Uarter CLoCK h oUrs tota L Units Lec/Sem Lab Clin Total DNHY 217 Community Oral Health Theory 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 303 Dental Materials and Techniques 20 \u2014 \u2014 20 2.0 DNHY 376 Dental Hygiene Clinic \u2014 \u2014 120 120 4.0 DNHY 380 Medically Compromised Patients 20 \u2014 \u2014 20 2.0 DNHY 382 Pharmacology for the Dental Hygienist II 11 \u2014 \u2014 11 1.0 DNHY 405 Introduction to Periodontics 20 \u2014 \u2014 20 2.0 DNHY 450 Junior Clinical Seminar 10 \u2014 \u2014 10 1.0 RELE 457 Christian Ethics and Health Care 20 \u2014 \u2014 20 2.0 Totals 123 \u2014 120 243 16.0 Winter Q Uarter CLoCK h oUrs tota L Units Lec/Sem Lab Clin Total DNHY 290 Research Design and Biostatistics 33 \u2014 \u2014 33 3.0 DNHY 408 Professional Ethics 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 410 Cultural Competency in Health Care 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 451 Clinical Seminar I 10 \u2014 \u2014 10 1.0 DNHY 475 Dental Hygiene Clinic I \u2014 \u2014 176 176 4.0 Totals 87 \u2014 176 263 12.0 sPring Q Uarter CLoCK h oUrs tota L Units Lec/Sem Lab Clin Total DNHY 218 Community Oral Health Practicum \u2014 \u2014 60 60 2.0 DNHY 415 Applied Nutrition 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 418 Critical Issues of Health Care 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 452 Clinical Seminar II 11 \u2014 \u2014 11 1.0 DNHY 476 Dental Hygiene Clinic II \u2014 \u2014 176 176 4.0 DNHY 495 Dental Hygiene National Board Preparation 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 Totals 77 \u2014 236 313 13.0270 UNIVERSITY CATALOG sUmmer Q Uarter CLoCK h oUrs tota L Units Lec/Sem Lab Clin Total DNHY 409 Jurisprudence and Practice Management 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 412 Dental Hygiene Topics II 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 435 Special Topics in Periodontal Therapy 22 \u2014 \u2014 22 2.0 DNHY 453 Clinical Seminar III 11 \u2014 \u2014 11 1.0 DNHY 477 Dental Hygiene Clinic III \u2014 \u2014 176 176 4.0 Totals 77 \u2014 176 253 11.0 overall t otals 772 258 858 1,888 100 .0 denta L hygiene\u2014 .s .

The educational design of this twenty-four month program provides a strong clinical background in anesthesiology. The program is based in the Kop - pel Special Care Dentistry Center (KSCDC), an outpatient facility utilizing general anesthesia for dental care. The KSCDC is located in the School of Dentistry, where approximately 4,000 patients are treated on an annual basis. Additional training at area hospitals is received in structured rotations in cardiology, internal medicine, and anesthesiol - ogy. Didactic instruction is coordinated through the School of Dentistry's Department of Dental An - esthesiology. Residents attend an anesthesiology lecture series and weekly grand rounds at Loma Linda University Medical Center. In addition, regular meetings of the dental anesthesiology resi - dents are held, during which a variety of contem - porary topics are discussed\u2014including a review of the current literature. Residents also participate in teaching pain control in the predoctoral curric - ulum and present at the annual Dental Anesthesia Symposium at Loma Linda University. Upon successful completion of the program, the dental anesthesiologist will be eligible to take the diplomate examination of the American Dental Board of Anesthesiology, and to apply for a gen - eral anesthesia permit in any state of the United States. Following enrollment into the program, residents may apply for acceptance to the Master of Science in Dentistry (M.S.D.) degree track, in addition to the specialty certificate.

Roger Hadley, M.D. Dean, School of Medicine 300 UNIVERSITY CATALOG School Foundations history The professional curriculum in medicine was first offered at Loma Linda University in 1909. Ten decades later, we have kept pace with the rapid growth of knowledge and technology. Nearly 10,000 students have graduated from the School of Medicine and have practiced in all corners of the earth, fulfilling the University's mission\u2014\"To make man whole.\" since 1909 The first two years of medical school were always taught on the Loma Linda campus. From 1913 to the mid-1960s, the third and fourth years were taught in Los Angeles at what is now White Memorial Medical Center and at nearby Los An - geles County Hospital (now Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center). Construction of Loma Linda University Medical Center (inclusive of clini - cal, teaching, and research facilities) allowed the entire four-year curriculum to be offered on and near the Loma Linda campus, beginning with school year 1966-1967. oUr m ission The mission of the School of Medicine is to con - tinue the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ, \"To make man whole\" (Luke 9:6). Preparing the physician Our purpose is the formation of Christian physi - cians, providing whole-person care to individuals, families, and communities. Fulfilling this respon - sibility requires\u2014 education Creating an environment in which medical students, graduate students, and residents will ac - quire the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes appropriate to Christian health professionals and scholars.research Cultivating an atmosphere of inquiry and dis - covering new routes to wholeness through basic and clinical research. service Providing timely access to cost-effective, safe, comprehensive, whole-person care for all patients, without regard for their circumstances or status. developing the whole person The Christian view of wholeness holds that the needs of patients go beyond the healing of the body, and that the development of students involves more than the training of the mind. We are dedicated to promoting physical, intellectual, social, and spiritual growth in our faculty and our students; and to transforming our daily activities into personal ministries. reaching the world Providing whole-person care wherever the op - portunity arises, participating with the world community in the provision of local medical education, providing international physicians and scientists the opportunities for professional in - teraction and enrichment, sharing the good news of a loving God as demonstrated by the life and teachings of Jesus Christ\u2014these are the goals of the students, faculty, and graduates of Loma Linda University School of Medicine. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meet - ing all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school and outlines the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program require - ments in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. Application and Admissions 301 Application and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admis - sions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant quali - ties of character and personality. the s tUdy of m ediCine Preparing for a career in medicine, students should quest for a broad understanding in the ma - jor areas of knowledge\u2014the natural sciences, the behavioral sciences, and the humanities\u2014which assists them in the process of learning throughout their life. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine looks for applicants who are best suited to fulfill the mission of the school and to successfully practice medicine. The school desires students who demonstrate the ability to learn independently, to think critically, and to ar - ticulate clearly\u2014both orally and in written form\u2014their ideas and opinions. It is important that students in the School of Medicine demonstrate excellent interpersonal skills and show evidence of sensitivity to the needs of humanity. The Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine puts forth considerable effort to ensure that an applicant is qualified for medical school. The applicant's credentials are reviewed to assess scholastic performance. The committee also looks for prerequisite qualities of character and person - ality, potential for self-direction and the use of discriminating judgment, and dedication to the ideal of service to society. genera L entran Ce information A total of 85 semester (128 quarter) units of credit from an accredited college is required for accep - tance by the School of Medicine. Preference is given, however, to college graduates. Credit must be presented for the following subjects: semester/quarter hours General biology or zoology with laboratory-8/12General or inorganic chemistry with labora - tory-8/12 Organic chemistry with laboratory-8/12Physics with laboratory-8/12English equivalent to satisfy baccalaureate de - gree requirement Religion as required by the college attended required Keyboard and computer skills recommended Introductory course in basic statisticsBiochemistry, strongly recommendedScience credits earned in professional schools (e.g., allied health professions, business, dentistry, nursing, or pharmacy) do not fulfill requirements for admission to medicine. CLEP and Pass/Fail performances are not acceptable for the required courses. The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is required. Scores older than three years will not be considered. aPPL iCation ProC edUre and aCC ePtan Ce It is important to know the specifics of the ap - plication process and to begin the application process well in advance of the date of anticipated (or desired) entrance to medical school. Where to write The School of Medicine is a member of the American Medical College Application Ser - vice (AMCAS). Applications must be submitted through AMCAS. Their application is available on the Web at <www.aamc.org/students/ amcas/ ap - plication.htm>.302 UNIVERSITY CATALOG amCas deadline Application should be made directly to AMCAS between June 1 and November 1 for entry in Au - gust of the following year. fees The AMCAS fee is required each time an ap - plication is submitted. An additional fee to the School of Medicine is required with each supple - mentary application. Procedure The application procedure is as follows: 1. The applicant submits a formal application to AMCAS, with fee and requested transcripts. The applicant's verified data are forwarded to the School of Medicine by AMCAS. 2. When the application is received from AMCAS, Loma Linda University School of Medicine requests completion of an online supplementary application. The prospective student should provide evidence of exposure to health care through personal involve - ment or in other ways, giving evidence of an informed decision confirming the applicant's decision to become a physician. 3. After the supplementary application and letters of reference have been submitted and reviewed, the applicant may be invited for an interview. 4. The information submitted by the applicant through AMCAS, the supplementary ap - plication, the letters of reference, and the interview reports are then evaluated by the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine. This committee determines whether an applicant is accepted or rejected. All applicants are notified of the final deci - sion of the Admissions Committee regarding their application. Acceptance notices are sent to regular applicants beginning December of the year preceding admission to the School of Medicine, continuing until the class is filled. 5. The accepted applicant sends a written ac -ceptance of his/her offer of admission as a student, together with a $100 acceptance deposit, by the announced date (about thirty days after the notification of acceptance). This deposit is refundable until May 15 of the year in which the student has been ac - cepted for entry. In summary, the Admissions Office re - quires the following: Verified AMCAS application Loma Linda University School of Medi - cine supplementary application and $75 application fee. Appraisal of the applicant's character, ability, and suitability for a medical ca - reer by persons knowledgeable about the applicant's past performance. A preprofessional recommendation packet, if available, from the applicant's undergraduate college/university. Applicant's availability for interviews, should an offer for an interview be extended. Pre-entrance health requirement and health coverage Students must meet the immunization require - ments as stated. In addition, students are expected to have routine dental and medical care and elective surgery attended to before registering for medical school. All School of Medicine students are provided with health coverage through the University's Department of Risk Management. The Student Health Plan remains in effect for students who are regularly enrolled, provided they register and pay tuition and fees on time each quarter. Since the maximum benefit of the plan (as of the time this CATALOG went to press) is $100,000 and does not cover preexisting illnesses or dental or opti - cal care, students are encouraged to maintain a personal, current policy that covers preexisting illnesses and/or has a higher benefit. A student who does not have health insurance coverage for his/her spouse/ children will need to purchase it through the University's Department of Risk Management at the time of registration. Govern - ment regulations prohibit the use of student loan Application and Admissions 303 funds to provide medical insurance or services for a student's spouse or children. Students who wish to review a copy of the cur - rent student health plan or have further questions about the plan should call Risk Management (909/558-4386). Annual tuition also covers the cost of disability insurance. Details will be presented during orientation or upon request. earLy deCision Program A highly qualified applicant to medical school may apply between June 1 and August 1 and be guaranteed a decision by October 1. During that period of time, the applicant may not apply to any other medical school; and if the applicant is ac - cepted at Loma Linda University, s/he is commit - ted to that decision. If the applicant is not accepted by October 1, s/he may apply to any school de - sired. An applicant not accepted by October 1 will be considered in the regular applicant pool. On the AMCAS application, the applicant indicates that s/he is an early decision applicant and agrees to comply with the constraints of that program. dead Lines June 1 to November 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission to the School of Medi - cine) is the period for submission of applica - tions for the first-year class. August 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for submission of application under the Early Decision Pro - gram. September 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for submission of the supplementary application for the Early Decision Program. November 15 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for receipt of the supplementary application for the regu - lar applicant pool. May 15 (of the year of admission) is the date beyond which the acceptance deposit of $100 is not refundable.transfer Under exceptional circumstances, the school accepts applicants into the junior year who are transferring from other U.S. medical schools. Such transfers must be for compelling circumstances and are subject to availability of space and ap - proval of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine Dean's Administrative Committee. The University reserves the right to require of an applicant satisfactory completion of written or practical examinations in any course for which transfer credit is requested. Successful completion of USMLE Step I is required. Loma Linda University sChoo L of m ediCine teChni CaL s tandards Loma Linda University School of Medicine candidates for the M.D. degree must have abilities and skills of five varieties, including: observation; communication; motor; intellectual (conceptual, integrative, and quantitative); behavioral and so - cial. Technological compensation can be made for some handicaps in certain areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably inde - pendent manner without the use of a surrogate. OBSERV ATION: The student must be able to ob - serve demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to physiologic and pharmacologic demonstrations in animals, microbiologic cultures, and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and patho - logic states. A student must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the senses of vision, touch, hearing, and somatic sensation. It is enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. COMMUNICATION: A student must be able to speak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to elicit information; describe changes in mood, activity, and posture; and perceive nonverbal communications. A student must be able to com - municate effectively and sensitively with patients, colleagues, and other personnel. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing. The student must be able to communicate 304 UNIVERSITY CATALOG effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. MOTOR: Students should have sufficient mo - tor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should be able to do basic laboratory tests (urinalysis, CBC, etc.); carry out diagnostic procedures (proctoscopy, paracentesis, etc.); and read EKGs and X-rays. A candidate should be able to execute motor move - ments reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment of patients. Examples of emergency treatment reasonably required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, the open - ing of obstructed airways, the suturing of simple wounds, and the performance of simple obstetri - cal maneuvers. Such actions require coordina - tion of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. INTELLECTUAL-CONCEPTUAL INTEGRA - TIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ABILITIES: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reason - ing, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL ATTRIBUTES: A student must possess the emotional stability required for full utilization of his/her intellec - tual abilities; the exercise of good judgment; the prompt completion of all responsibilities atten - dant to the diagnosis and care of patients; and the development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients. Students must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, honesty, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are expected of Loma Linda University School of Medicine students.Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Loma Linda Univer - sity Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available on the University Web site. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook and to abide by its policies. Additional information regarding policies spe - cific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. Students who have questions about the Student Handbook should contact the associate dean for student affairs. stUdent o rganizations The purpose of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine student organizations is to: 1. Create an avenue through which students may seek constructive solutions to problems and enhance their educational experience; 2. Develop ways to further the mission of the School and add to the medical school expe - rience by organizing social, spiritual, and service activities; 3. Engage students in issues related to medical education and health care through participa - tion in regional and national professional organizations. At registration into the School of Medicine, stu - dents automatically become members of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine Student As - sociation (SMSA). Student organizations that operate within the School of Medicine and that are represented on the School of Medicine Senate include the follow - ing: The American Medical Association-Medical Student Section (AMA-MSS), Loma Linda University chapter The American Medical Student Association (AMSA), Loma Linda University chapter The Christian Medical and Dental Associa - tion (CMDA) Curriculum 305 Hands-On Wholeness (HOW) The Organization of Student Representatives (OSR) to the Association of American Medi - cal Colleges (AAMC) Student National Medical Association, Loma Linda University chapter Two additional student organizations are based in the School of Medicine but are not required to have representatives at Senate meetings. These service-focused organizations, which involve students from a number of schools within the University, are as follows: the Healthy Neighborhoods Project the Mission Interest Group Loma Linda University students are represented by peers at the San Bernardino County Medical Society, the California Medical Association, the American Medical Association, the American Medical Student Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Student Na - tional Medical Association. Curriculum Who Le-Person f ormation Personal and professional growth for the student in medicine is the focus of the disciplines in the school, the faculty in the School of Medicine, and the School of Religion. Courses and content are of - fered to emphasize biblical, ethical, and relational aspects of the physician's personal and profes - sional development. The core for whole-person formation\u2014fourteen quarter units of religion and ethics\u2014is provided during the first three years of the medicine curriculum. Learning oU tComes for mediCaL s tUdent e dUCation outcome i Students will develop a knowledge base in the basic sciences essential for advancement to the next phase of their medical education.outcome ii Students will develop the clinical skills that are integral to the safe and competent practice of medicine. outcome iii Students will integrate basic science knowledge, clinical skills, values, and professional behaviors within the context of providing whole-person care for patients. outcomes iv Students will develop diagnostic reasoning and analytic problem-solving skills in order to assimi - late information and establish appropriate diagno - ses and treatment plans. outcome v Students will develop interpersonal and commu - nication skills that will enable them to effectively interact with peers, faculty, patients and their families, and other health care providers\u2014includ - ing those from diverse backgrounds (e.g., cultural, ethnic, gender, generational, socioeconomic, and religious). outcome vi Students will develop professionalism, excellence and scholarship, accountability and responsibility; and demonstrate altruistic behaviors. outcome vii Students will integrate ethical and Christ-cen - tered principles of conduct into their personal and professional lives. outcome viii Students will integrate their knowledge, skills, and behaviors through a spectrum of active learn - ing activities.306 UNIVERSITY CATALOG outcome ix Students will acquire the knowledge and skills needed to foster self-direction for lifelong learn - ing. Academic Information The academic progress of each student is moni - tored by the Academic Review Committee. Spe - cific policies for handling misconduct (academic or nonacademic) are published in the Student Handbook 2006. Comm UniCations Communications to the medical student regard - ing academic and clinical assignments, scholar - ship opportunities, and other important informa - tion are routed through the Office of the Dean. The student mailboxes and bulletin board are located in the medical center. It is the responsibil - ity of students to check their email and mailboxes and the bulletin board daily. reQUired sUPPL ies microscope The student is expected to have access to a satis - factory compound microscope (usually one rented from the school) that meets the following require - ments: The microscope shall be no older than fifteen years. The lenses shall be in good condition and shall include scanning and oil-immersion objectives. The equipment shall include an Abbe con - denser with rack-and-pinion adjustment, an iris diaphragm, and a mechanical stage. textbooks Students are required to purchase the textbooks adopted by the School of Medicine Curriculum Committee.instruments Students are required to purchase the instru - ments adopted by the physical diagnosis course. Pra CtiCes and r egULations Length of academic residence To fulfill the degree requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, it is the usual policy that the student must be registered for full-time course work during the entire junior and senior academic years for the Doctor of Medicine degree. Course exemptions Students who seek exemption from registering for courses that they took prior to entering the School of Medicine must qualify for the exemption by passing a comprehensive examination covering the course material in question. Should the student qualify, in lieu of the regular course, the student will be required to participate in an advanced program that may include addi - tional studies, research activities, and/or teaching. A written paper will be required from all students completing the advanced program. The course director, the senior associate dean of medical student education, and the student will work together to determine the content of the advanced program. Full tuition, equivalent to that of the regular program, will be charged. examinations Students are required to take examinations at the scheduled time. Students who arrive more than 15 minutes late to an examination will be denied entrance. Students who arrive after any other student has left the examination for any reason will not be permitted to take the examination. For National Board subject examinations, students will be denied entrance once the examination has started. Examinations will not be extended beyond the announced termination time, even if a student arrives late. Academic Information 307 missed examinations Should a student miss a midterm examination because of an \"excused\" absence, the examination cannot be made up at a later time. Instead, the comprehensive final examination in the course for which the missed examination occurred will be weighted an amount extra, proportional to the weighting of the missed examination(s). In addi - tion, course directors may require other remedia - tion at their discretion. Should a student miss an in-house final exami - nation because of an \"excused\" absence, arrange - ments must be made with the course director(s) of the missed examinations(s) to make-up the missed examination(s). The course director(s), at his/her discretion, may require the student to take an examination that is different in format, content, or length from the final examination that was administered to the class. Should a student miss a National Board Subject Examination because of an \"excused\" absence, the student will be allowed to make up the subject examination upon completing all other course work for that year at the end of the academic year. Arrangements for the make up examination must be made through the Office of Medical Student Education. Conditions to be met for an \"exCUsed\" absen Ce In order to have an \"excused\" absence, the student must get a written excuse from the Office of Medical Student Education prior to the admin - istration of the test in question. Students missing examinations for health reasons must provide written documentation from Student Health that they were indeed ill. Whether or not this docu - mentation is an adequate excuse for missing a test will be left to the discretion of the senior associ - ate dean for medical student education. Once a request for an examination excuse has been received, the Office of Medical Student Education will determine whether or not the student will be required to make up the examination at a later date (generally within a week of the missed ex - amination) or have the final examination count an extra amount proportional to the missed examina - tion. Under no circumstances are students allowed to take examinations earlier than scheduled. In the event of a bona fide emergency, where prior approval is not feasible, the Office of Medical Student Education (909/558-4255) must be contact - ed as soon as possible. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. Students who miss examinations without prior approval from the Office of Medical Student Education will incur an \"unexcused\" absence. As a result, the student will receive a zero for the missed examination(s). Missing more than one examination in any course or combination of courses could result in a student having to repeat the course(s) during the next academic year. grading policy Course directors submit grades at the end of the course, indicating the overall evaluation of the student's performance in the course. The grade reflects the success or failure of the student in meeting the objectives of the course in terms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values. The grade will be recorded as SATISFACTORY if the student exceeded the minimum requirements for overall performance. The grade assigned will be UNSAT - ISFACTORY if the student did not meet the mini - mum requirements for overall performance. The grade assigned will be MARGINAL SATISFAC - TORY if the student met but did not exceed the minimum requirements for overall performance. Complete promotion and retention policies are distributed to each class at orientation. Class standing Class standing is determined by the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education and is based on student performance on in-house, faculty-generated examinations and on NBME subject examinations. Promotion Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic performance. Both cognitive and noncognitive evaluations of academic performance\u2014as well as assessment of personal suitability to assume the responsibilities of the medical profession\u2014308 UNIVERSITY CATALOG are utilized in making promotion decisions. The Academic Review Committee of the School of Medicine periodically reviews student perfor - mance and progress and recommends promotion, retention, or dismissal on the basis of the overall academic record. The Student Handbook contains additional details regarding the criteria used by the Academic Review Committee for promotion decisions. academic probation Students whose cumulative academic record at the end of any academic year is less than satisfac - tory are placed on academic probation. Withdrawal To withdraw from a course(s), the student must file a Change of Program form; to completely withdraw from school, a Total Withdrawal form must be completed. These forms should be com - pleted and submitted on the last day of class at - tendance. The date of withdrawal used in calcu - lating tuition refunds will be the date on which the properly completed form is submitted to the Office of University Records. UsmLe steps i and ii policy States vary in the number of times a student can attempt USMLE examinations and still be eligible for licensure. A significant number of states al - low no more than three attempts. The school has defined its own limits for number of attempts al - lowed. School policy requires students enrolled in the Loma Linda University School of Medicine to pass Step I in no more than three attempts. Students must complete the clinical course work required for graduation within three years of starting the clinical curriculum; they are permit - ted a maximum of four sequential attempts to pass Step II of the USMLE. The student's first attempt at passing Step II of the USMLE must take place only after s/he has satisfactorily passed all junior clerkships and prior to his/her completion of all required senior clinical course work. A student who has failed Step II but who has completed all course curriculum requirements must remain enrolled in the School of Medicine as a directed study student until s/he either has passed Step II of the USMLE or failed Step II of the USMLE for the fourth time. During this directed study, the student will be charged tuition. doCtor of m ediCine d egree reQUirements The School of Medicine requires that a candidate for a degree or certificate from the school must have met the following requirements for the Doc - tor of Medicine degree: Completed all requirements for admission. Attended an accredited medical school for four academic years, the last two of which must have been spent at this school. Completed honorably all requirements of the curriculum, including specified attendance, level of scholarship, length of academic resi - dence, and credit units. Completed additional special examinations covering any or all subjects of the medical curriculum, as may be required.

After completing a common first-year core curriculum, students will select a program and a mentor for the completion of their studies, during which advanced courses and laboratory work allow the student to fully develop an area of research interest and expertise. Students usually rotate through up to three research laboratories before selecting a research advisor. The M.S. degree course of study provides edu - cation appropriate for technicians involved in biomedical research and for medical technologists seeking career advancement. A pathway to com - bined M.D./Ph.D. degrees is also offered. The School of Medicine's Division of Biochem - istry offers programs leading to the Doctor of Philosophy and Master of Science degrees. These programs include a core curriculum that provides a broad background in biochemistry-related is - sues and approaches. Advanced courses allow each student to fully develop an area of interest. Research strengths of the department include: cancer biology, DNA damage and repair, measure - ment of thyroid hormones, coagulation, neurobiol - ogy, peptide structure, vaccine development, and radiation biology. m .s . and Ph .d d egrees The School of Medicine's Division of Biochem - istry offers study in the Biochemistry Program leading to the Master of Science and the Doctor of Philosophy degrees. These degree programs provide a broad biochemical background while al - lowing the student to fully develop a special area of research interest. The Master of Science degree provides content appropriate for persons prepar - ing to teach at the secondary level or in related professional school areas, or for persons intend - ing to pursue careers as research technicians. The Doctor of Philosophy degree is designed to prepare the graduate for a career in independent research and teaching in university, clinical, biotechnological, or government environments. Doctoral degree students are expected to develop creativity and independence, in addition to techni - cal skills.Combined degrees Combined degrees (Ph.D./M.D. and M.S./M.D.) options are also available. The combination of an M.S. degree with a professional degree provides additional content and research experience as a background for postgraduate medical or dental education. The combination of a Ph.D. degree with a professional degree prepares the student for a future in academic medicine or dentistry\u2014com - bining research, teaching, and clinical practice. The combined degrees are described at the end of Section III in this CATALOG.

SOWERS, Ph.D., Program Director obJeCtives Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students. Stu - dents interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine and medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined degrees programs. The Medical Scientist Program is designed to develop a student's independence and compe - tence as an investigative scientist and clinician. It provides students with a broad educational base for the practice of medicine and medically related research. The program is administered by the School of Medicine in cooperation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Program d esCriPtion The program is designed to attract students who are energized by doing research and want to con - tribute substantially to this enterprise. Students enter this combined degrees program through the graduate program. In the first year, students participate in a new and revised, scientif - ically integrated program that includes biochemis - try, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, and anatomy. While in the first year, students also rotate through the laboratories of selected faculty members.In the second year, students increase their involvement with individual laboratory projects while continuing to complete graduate course requirements. Students in selected areas may also be asked to serve as teaching assistants for gradu - ate or medical classes. Students pursuing the combined degrees will also be involved with joint basic science and clinical meetings and confer - ences with the aim of understanding the interre - lationships between laboratory-based and clinical research. Upon demonstration of laboratory success, as indicated by completion of a first-author manu - script, the student will continue on to the tradi - tional first two years of the medical school cur - riculum. It is anticipated that the amount of time required to demonstrate laboratory success will be two-to-three years. Successful students who have acquired essential laboratory skills should con - tinue their affiliation with the host laboratory and continue research progress as time permits while in the medical school curriculum. Upon successful completion of the first two years of the medical curriculum and Step 1 of the USMLE, students will begin a series of rotations between the clinical sciences and the research laboratory. During these later years, students will 326 UNIVERSITY CATALOG complete all of the standard clinical rotations and continue progress on laboratory projects. It is the intent of this program that students will acquire the requisite skills needed for a successful career at the interface of laboratory-based and clinical research. Program a dmission Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitive and requires evidence that the student is likely to develop into a successful medi - cal scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements for each of these programs. The application package for the Ph.D. degree program requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination. Both programs must accept the student's scores before s/he is admitted to the Medical Scientist Pro - gram. Students entering the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program who determine that a research career is inappropriate may elect to complete the M.D. degree program independently. Students entering the Ph.D. degree program who desire a career in academic medicine may choose to apply for admission to the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program at a point after their entry into the Ph.D. degree program; however, the standard medical school application process will be required at that point. finan CiaL a ssistan Ce Financial assistance to students in the Medical Scientist Program may provide: 1. Cost-of-living stipends during those periods in which students are most directly involved in graduate education. The amount of the sti - pend is equivalent to that available to Ph.D. degree students in the basic science graduate programs.*2. Tuition waivers for all graduate program course work. 3. Tuition deferment for the freshman and sophomore years of the M.D. degree curricu - lum. When a student completes an M.S. or Ph.D. degree, tuition deferred from the fresh - man and sophomore years is canceled. 4. Tuition waiver for both the junior and senior years of the M.D. curriculum, upon comple - tion of a Ph.D. degree. M.D./Ph.D. degree students are ordinarily expected to complete their Ph.D. degree before be - ginning the third year of medical school. Students who have not completed the Ph.D. degree may ap - ply for a tuition deferment for their junior year of the medical curriculum, and, in unusual cases, for the first quarter of their senior year. Applications for tuition deferment beyond the first two years must be approved by the student's dissertation committee and signed by the dissertation advisor, the associate dean for basic sciences, and the dean of the School of Medicine. Under no circumstanc - es will a student be granted a tuition deferment or be allowed to register for the last two quarters of medical school until s/he has finished the require - ments for the Ph.D degree. If a student withdraws from the Ph.D. degree program his/her tuition deferments will be converted to a loan. Comple - tion of the M.D. degree terminates the student's participation in the Medical Scientist Program and ends the availability of tuition waiver. Any tuition deferments then in force will convert to loan obli - gations at that time. * Stipends from the School of Medicine will be awarded for the first two years of the graduate program, provided that the student makes satis - factory academic process and remains in good and regular standing. Stipends covering study beyond the first two years should ordinarily be obtained from the individual laboratories or departments in which the student conducts research. Biomedical Sciences\u2014SM 327 Biomedical Sciences\u2014SM (Pb Certificate) KENNETH WRIGHT, Ph.D., Program Coordinator faCUL ty Students accepted into the postbaccalaureate certificate Biomedical Sciences Program enroll in basic science courses with first-year medical students. Faculty responsible for teaching students in the Biomedical Sciences Program will be those who teach these first-year basic science courses. The certificate program enables students to complete their studies with one academic year of full-time commitment. The program is intended to provide postbaccalaureate experience in the rapid - ly changing area of biomedical sciences. As such, it will either augment other career choices\u2014such as high school teaching, patent law, or biotechnol - ogy management\u2014or improve the preparation for professional training in medicine. admission Applicants to the Biomedical Sciences Program must satisfy the same requirements as those ap - plying to medicine at Loma Linda University; that is, they will have completed a baccalaureate de - gree (or its equivalent) with a course of study that includes a year each of general biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry and general physics. Applicants are required to take the Medical Col - lege Acceptance Test (MCAT) with no score less than 6 and an aggregate score greater than 20.CoUrse of s tUdy Students are currently required to complete 36 units selected from courses indicated by the program coordinator. These courses will include 3 units of religion, with the remaining units select - ed from the first-year medical curriculum. The curriculum followed by the biomedical sciences certificate students will be developed in consultation with the program director, and will typically include gross anatomy, physiology, and either cell structure and function or biochemis - try and neuroscience. In addition, students are asked to enroll in a critical-thinking course, and in one religion course. The total number of units for which students enroll during a school year is approximately 36. In special circumstances, students might be able to transfer course credits obtained in the Bio - medical Sciences Program to a master's degree program in the basic sciences. In order to transfer credit to a master's degree program, the student must obtain a letter grade of B or better in a given course. Although several of the courses may share lecture experience and tests with the Doctor of Medicine degree program, such courses will not be transferred to the M.D. degree program; and a student subsequently admitted to the M.D. degree program should expect to take, and pay for, the normal M.D. degree curriculum. first y ear, sU mmer Q Uarter Units ANAT 550 Gross Anatomy/Embryology 1.0 BCHM 511 Medical Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Genetics I 1.0 MDCJ 504 Cell Structure and Function 2.0 PHSL 521 Medical Physiology GS I 1.0 STCJ 501 Critical Thinking 4.0 Totals 9.0 aUtUmn Q Uarter Units ANAT 551 Medical Gross Anatomy/Embryology II 5.0 BCHM 512 Medical Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Genetics II 3.0328 UNIVERSITY CATALOG MDCJ 505 Cell Structure and Function 3.0 PHSL 522 Medical Physiology GS II 1.0 Totals 12.0 Winter Q Uarter Units ANAT 552 Medical Gross Anatomy/Embryology III 2.0 MDCJ 506 Cell Structure and Function 2.0 PHSL 523 Medical Physiology GS III 5.0 Totals 9.0 sPring Q Uarter Units ANAT 553 Medical Gross Anatomy/Embryology IV 1.0 MDCJ 507 Cell Structure and Function 2.0 PHSL 524 Medical Physiology GS IV 1.0 REL_ 5__ Graduate-level Religion 3.0 Totals 7.0 overall t otals 37 .0 will make use of a wide variety of pedagogical methods\u2014including but not limited to traditional lecture, small group, problem-based and case-based learning, personalized computer-based instruction, quantitative laboratory experiences, and patient-care experiences.

ROGER HADLEY, Dean, School of Medicine CUrriCULU m The curriculum in medicine consists of four aca - demic years. Instruction is on the quarter system. The first eight quarters are oriented to the sciences basic to the practice of medicine; the remaining two academic years are made up of clinically ori - ented core instruction and up to eighteen weeks of clinical electives. THE FIRST YEAR of medical education will begin to establish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine\u2014with empha - sis on the principles and mechanisms of normal development, structure, and function\u2014including the normal changes of aging and the behavioral considerations that influence normal develop - ment. Course content will be organized around individual organ systems whenever possible. The first year will also begin to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and professional behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, and Christian practice of medicine both now and in the future. The educational program Medicine\u2014SM (m .d . ) Medicine\u2014SM 329 THE THIRD YEAR of medical education will establish a body of knowledge, skills, values, at - titudes, and behaviors in six core clinical science disciplines to build a foundation for patient care in ambulatory and hospital-based settings. Students will attain this foundation through a process of self-directed learning, independent study, and guided supervision and teaching by house staff and faculty. Students will have ample opportunity to learn the value of honor, shared responsibility, and accountability by directly participating in patient-care activities as junior colleagues on the health care team. The didactic program will emphasize: a) un - derstanding the pathophysiology of disease; b) establishing diagnoses through interpretation of physical examination and diagnostic data; and c) applying management principles to patients with acute and chronic conditions. Recurring experi - ences in whole-person care, medical ethics, labora - tory medicine, health maintenance, and disease prevention will be integrated into the six core disciplines. Students will have the opportunity to explore an area of interest during an elective expe - rience for the purpose of beginning the process of choosing a career in medicine. THE FOURTH YEAR of medical education will require students to integrate the entirety of their medical knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes gained during the first three years and apply it more autonomously to patient care. Students will participate in supervised patient-care experi - ences in neurology or family medicine, emer - gency medicine, intensive care medicine, and a subintern-level experience in medicine, surgery, or pediatrics. Although repetitive clinical duties dur - ing the fourth year are a necessary part of prepar - ing students for the rigors of postgraduate train - ing, students will still have ample opportunity to pursue individual interests during a minimum eighteen weeks of elective rotations. To reestablish the importance of science in medical practice, at least one month of elective may be in the basic sci - ence discipline of the student's choosing. Students will have adequate vacation time to study for Step II of the USMLE and successfully participate in the residency selection process. Whole-person formation Personal and professional growth for the stu - dent in medicine is the focus of the disciplines in the school, the faculty in the School of Medicine, and the School of Religion. Courses and content are offered to emphasize biblical, ethical, and relational aspects of the physician's personal and professional development. The core for whole-person formation\u201414 quarter units of religion and ethics\u2014is provided during the first three years of the medicine curriculum. first y ear, sU mmer Q Uarter Units ANAT 521

In 1907, the first class to graduate included seven students\u2014five women and two men. As the school developed and be - came a college-based program rather than a hos - pital diploma program, the baccalaureate degree commenced in 1949. The Master of Science degree was granted in 1957. The Doctor of Philosophy degree was added to the existing programs of the school, with the first class starting in 2002. The School of Nursing programs received ac - creditation by the National League for Nursing (NLN) (61 Broadway, New York, NY 10006) in 1951. The most recent accreditation for the B.S. and M.S. degree programs (1999) was by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) (One Dupont Circle NW, Suite 530, Washington, DC 20036-1120) in 1999. The California Board of Reg - istered Nursing (P . O. Box 944210, Sacramento, CA 94244-2100) granted continuing approval in 2008. Consumers are encouraged to contact CCNE or BRN with comments about the program. agen Cy m embershi P The School of Nursing holds agency member - ships and actively participates in the following major professional organizations: American As - sociation of Colleges of Nursing, National League for Nursing, and Western Institute for Nursing. Our Mission The mission of the School of Nursing, in accord with the comprehensive mission of Loma Linda University, is the education of professional nurses who are dedicated to excellence in nursing science. Individuals from diverse ethnic, cultural, and racial backgrounds are encouraged to embrace opportunities for lifelong growth and satisfaction from a career committed to health care. Baccalau - reate and graduate nursing programs contribute to the development of expert clinicians, educa - tors, administrators, and researchers who benefit society by providing and improving delivery of whole-person care to clients\u2014individuals, families, groups, and communities. Committed to Christian service and distinctive Seventh-day Adventist ideals, the school seeks to reflect God's love through its teaching and healing ministry.

Philosophy In harmony with Loma Linda University and the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the School of Nursing believes that the aim of education and health care is the development of wholeness in those served. Individuals, created to reflect the wholeness of God's character, have been impaired by the entrance of sin, disease, and death. God's purpose is the restoration of each person to the original state at Creation. God works through hu - man agencies to facilitate individual wholeness. Nursing functions to assist individuals and societal groups to attain their highest potential of wholeness. Through a variety of roles, nurses put into practice a body of knowledge and a repertoire of skills to assist the human system with health 374 UNIVERSITY CATALOG problems. The School of Nursing provides an environment in which students and faculty can grow in professional competence and Christian grace. In support of the philosophy, mission, and values of Loma Linda University and the philosophy, mission, and values of the School of Nursing, the faculty affirms the following beliefs: Learning is an interactive process that in - volves all of the learner's faculties. A learning environment nurtures the devel - opment of potential, promotes maturation of values, cultivates the ability to think criti - cally and independently, and encourages a spirit of inquiry. Clinical experiences are essential to the development of professional and technical nursing competence. Students\u2014influenced by the effect of physi - ological, psychological, sociocultural, devel - opmental, and spiritual variables on their lives\u2014learn in different ways and bring dif - ferent meanings to the learning experience. Students participate in development of the science and practice of nursing.

The Doctor of Philosophy degree program is designed to prepare nurse scholars for education, administration, and research. stUdent i nvo Lvement Students are encouraged to become actively involved in the Associated Students of Nursing. Student representatives are invited to attend the Undergraduate Faculty Council, Master's Faculty Council, Doctoral Faculty Council, Spiritual Life and Wholeness Committee, and Diversity Com - mittee, where they may contribute to the decision-making process. stUdent o rganizations The following student organizations enable the student to participate in cultural, social, profes - sional, and citizenship aspects of University life. associated s tudents of n ursing (asn ) The ASN is a student organization of the School of Nursing. This association is comprised of all the students of nursing and is administered by elected students and two faculty sponsors. The objectives of this organization are to serve as a channel for communication between students and faculty, and to facilitate personal and professional growth by meaningful participation in all aspects of student life. Loma Linda University s tudent association (LLU sa) The LLUSA has three purposes: to promote com - munication among students, to present students' views to the administration, and to assist in the programming of social and religious activities. The LLUSA provides opportunities to develop and refine a wide range of professional leader - ship and fellowship skills. The office is located in the Drayson Center. For more information, call 909/558-4978.Class organizations The members of the junior and senior classes elect officers and promote such projects and activities as constitute their major interests and concerns. honor s oCiety: s igma t heta taU internationaL In 1975, LLUSN became an official chapter of Sigma Theta Tau International, the honor society for nursing. Students may be invited to become members if they meet the established criteria. Academic Policies and Practices Undergrad Uate d ePartment academic residence To qualify for an undergraduate degree from Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 45 units at Loma Linda Univer - sity; 32 of the units must be at the senior level. A minimum of three clinical nursing courses are required as part of these units. nursing Courses nUrsing C oUrse grades Most nursing courses in the undergraduate curriculum are divided into approximately equal components of theory and clinical laboratory practice. A grade for a nursing course represents a combination of the theory and the clinical labora - tory grades. In order to pass a nursing course, a student must receive a grade equivalent to a C or above in both the theory and clinical laboratory sections of the course. To receive a passing grade in theory, the student must obtain a cumulative score of at least 76 percent on examinations within that course. A grade of C- or below places the student on provisional status and requires that the student repeat the course. Academic Policies and Practices 379 Percentage breakdown for grading The undergraduate division of the School of Nursing uses the following percentages for com - puting grades: 95-100% D Below 62% F Clinical experiences Clinical experiences are under the direction of the course coordinator. The student has super - vised experience under a clinical instructor in the care of patients. Tardiness or unexcused absences from clinical laboratory is cause for failure. Stu - dents must make up for absences due to extenuat - ing circumstances (e.g., personal illness or death in the family). A fee of $50 will be charged for make-up of clinical laboratory during nonclinical time. Nursing students are required to practice in client-care settings under the supervision of a registered nurse. Each student will be expected to be able to apply basic theoretical concepts to clini - cal practice by assessing; planning; implementing nursing procedures; and evaluating the care of individuals, families, and communities. In the performance of routine nursing care, all students will function within the policies of the clinical agency and demonstrate the professional behav - ior outlined in the University CATALOG and the University Student Handbook. Students are expected to be knowledgeable about clients and their problems and about the plans for care prior to actually giving care. They must come prepared for the clinical experience and must ade - quately assess a client, using the Neuman Systems Model. Students are expected to perform skills safely. Students whose performance is deemed unsafe may be dropped from the course.Licensure To be eligible to write the NCLEX-RN examina - tion, the student must have completed all required nursing course work listed in this Catalog. Fur - ther, the student needs to be aware that, under the laws of California, a candidate for the examination is required to report all misdemeanor and felony convictions. If a candidate has a criminal history, the California Board of Registered Nursing will determine the eligibility of that individual to write the licensing examination. Credit by e xamination Cha LLenge/ eQU iva Len Cy examination An undergraduate student may meet academic requirements by passing an examination at least equal in scope and difficulty to examina - tions in the course. Undergraduate students with prior education in nursing or in another health care profession are eligible to challenge nursing courses required for California state licensure. The applicant's background in health care theory and clinical experience must be commensurate with the theory and skills required for the course. Challenge examinations in nursing courses in - clude both a written examination covering theory and an examination of clinical competence. A fee is charged for a challenge examination. See the \"Schedule of Charges\" in this section for fees. Progression to the next level in the program is permissible only after successful completion of the challenge examination. A grade of S is recorded for challenge credit earned by examination only after the student has successfully completed a minimum of 12 units of credit at this University with a G.P .A. of 2.0 or above. advan Ced PL aCement Credit toward graduation may be accepted by the school for an entering student who has passed one or more Advanced Placement (AP) examina - tions with a score of 3, 4, or 5. Records for AP courses must be sent directly from the College Board to University Records. For specific policy and time limits regarding 380 UNIVERSITY CATALOG CLEP examinations, see \" Academic Policies\" in the University section of the CATALOG. repeating a course A grade of C (2.0) is the minimum passing grade for nursing and required cognate courses. Required cognates include: epidemiology, eth - ics, nutrition, statistics, and writing. Any nursing or named cognate course taken while a student at Loma Linda University School of Nursing in which the earned grade is C- or lower must be re - peated before the student can progress to another course. A nursing course or required cognate may be repeated only once. When a student repeats a course, both the original and repeat grades are entered on the student's permanent record; but only the repeat grade and credit are computed in the grade-point average and included in the total units earned. Probation status Students whose cumulative G.P .A. at the end of any quarter is less than 2.0, or who have received a C- or below in a nursing course or named cog - nate, or who have withdrawn (W) due to failing are placed on academic probation. Students on probation status will be required to take NRSG 244 Skills for Academic Success and to communi - cate regularly with the academic advisor. Students on probation status may take only one clinical nursing course at a time and no more than 12 units. When the course work has been repeated successfully, the student is returned to regular status. Enrollment in the School of Nursing will be terminated if a student receives two grades of C- or below in nursing or required cognates. See Student Handbook for grievance procedure. graduation r equirements A candidate must complete the undergraduate \"Intent to Graduate\" form two quarters prior to completion of degree. A degree will be granted when the student has met the following requirements:1. Completed all requirements for admission to the respective curriculum. 2. Honorably completed all requirements of the curriculum, including specified attendance, level of scholarship, and length of academic residence. 3. Completed a minimum of 193.0 quarter units for the baccalaureate degree with a mini - mum G.P .A. of 2.0 overall and in nursing. 4. Given evidence of moral character, of due regard for Christian citizenship, and of consistent responsiveness to the established aims of the University and of the respective discipline. 5. Discharged financial obligations to the Uni - versity. It is the responsibility of the student to see that all requirements have been met. A student who completes the requirements for a degree at the end of the Spring Quarter is expect - ed to be present at the University's ceremony for conferring of degrees and presenting of diplomas. Permission for the conferral of a degree in absen - tia is granted by the University upon recommen - dation of the dean of the school. A student who completes the requirements for a degree at the end of the Summer, Autumn, or Winter quarter is invited, but not required, to par - ticipate in the subsequent conferring of degrees. Degrees are conferred at graduations only. The University reserves the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises by a candidate who has not satisfactorily complied with all requirements. grad Uate d ePartment academic residence To qualify for a degree from the graduate depart - ment in nursing at Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 80 percent of the academic curriculum while in residence at the University. For the master's degree, this would be 42-58 units, depending on the selected concen - tration area. For Doctor of Nursing Practice this would be 50 units. For the Doctor of Philosophy degree, this would be 72 units. Academic Policies and Practices 381 transfer credits 1. A transfer student may transfer credits up to one-fifth of the units required by the chosen program to be applied to the degree at Loma Linda University. This transfer is limited to credits for which a grade of B (3.0) or better has been recorded and the course work was done at an accredited institution. 2. A maximum of 9 (nine) quarter units that have been previously applied to another degree may be accepted as transfer credits upon petition. 3. Following acceptance into a graduate pro - gram, all required courses must be taken at Loma Linda University. 4. Credits taken through NEXus for graduate courses are not considered transfer credits. 5. Transfer credits will not be used to offset course work at this University that is less than a B. nondegree student credit A maximum of 12 units may be taken by permis - sion of the instructors prior to acceptance into the program. If these courses are part of the curricu - lar plan for the selected concentration area, and if the grade earned is B or higher, the credits may be applied toward that degree. academic standing Students are expected to maintain a G.P .A. of 3.0 (B average). A. Course grades 1. The expected earned grade level for graduate studies is a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 (B average) or higher. 2. Students must earn a grade of B (85%) or higher in all courses. If less than a B is the earned grade, the course must be repeated. B. Withdrawal and repeating courses 1. A student may withdraw only once from a core, concentration, or clinical course.2. A student may repeat a course only one time. 3. A student may repeat no more than two courses in the program.a. Two core or concentration courses may be repeated b. Only one clinical course may be re - peated, along with a core or concen - tration course. C. Academic probation At the end of each quarter, student G.P .A.s will be reviewed. Students will be placed on probationary status if the earned G.P .A. is less than 3.0 for the quarter, cumulatively, or in the nursing major While on probation a student: 1. May not take the clinical focus courses. 2. May not take the comprehensive exami - nation. Academic probation may be removed: 1. By raising the G.P .A. to 3.0 or higher the next quarter. 2. By retaking the course in which a grade lower than B was earned to raise the earned grade the next time the course is offered. 3. If the low grade occurred in a clinical course, that course must be retaken and a grade of B or higher earned before proceeding in the clinical sequence. It will be necessary to wait until the course is offered again and has space. Students requesting to repeat a clinical course due to a low grade are placed on a waiting list, according to the timing of the request. D. Academic termination for students on aca - demic probation Academic enrollment will be terminated if: 1. The cumulative G.P .A. has not been raised to 3.0 or above 2. All grades lower than B have not been 382 UNIVERSITY CATALOG raised within two quarters or the next time the course is offered. Clinical probation Clinical work must be evaluated as satisfac - tory. Faculty may recommend that the student be placed on clinical probation. While on probation, the student must demonstrate satisfactory clinical work as stipulated by the faculty; or the student will be dismissed from the school. application for candidacy A student in the master's degree program will apply for candidacy on Form A after complet - ing at least 25 units of required graduate course work. A Ph.D. degree student will be advanced to candidacy after successful defense of the disser - tation proposal. A D.N.P . degree student will be advanced to candidacy after successful defense of the project proposal. time limits The time lapse from first enrollment in a gradu - ate curriculum to the conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five years. For the doctoral degree, seven years are allowed after the date of admission. A student desiring reinstatement must reapply to the dean. This procedure implies a re-evaluation of the student's total academic plan. Any credit transferred to the school or taken in residence and submitted toward a graduate degree is nullified seven years from the date when the course was completed. statistics and research prerequisites Introduction to statistics and research courses are a prerequisite to entry to the master's degree. The courses STAT 414 and 509. as well as NRSG 429\u2014described in the University CATALOG\u2014ful - fill the prerequisite requirement. scholastic standing grade s CaLe The graduate department in nursing uses the fol -lowing percentages for determining F Practicum experiences Practicum experiences shall be individually structured to meet students' needs and program requirements.

Students requesting practicum experiences at sites that will require ad - ditional costs\u2014such as faculty travel, phone calls, or legal advice\u2014are responsible for this expense. Comprehensive examination A written, comprehensive examination is re - quired of all students. The student is expected to integrate, evaluate, and apply theories and con - cepts covered in graduate study. The examination must be taken after a substantial portion of the clinical work is completed and before enrolling for the last 8 units of the program. thesis and dissertation The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the stu - dent's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as is feasible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Thesis is optional for the M.S. degree.

Students are expected to operate under the gen - eral policies of the University and school and the specific policies of the degree program in which they are enrolled. The school reserves the right to update and modify the curriculum to keep cur - rent with trends in health care. b .s . degree The primary aim of the School of Nursing bacca - laureate nursing program is to prepare competent practitioners who are committed to excellence in practice and to Christian principles. The faculty believe that baccalaureate education in nursing is the basis for professional practice. The basic professional curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in nursing is consistent with the faculty belief that students should be broadly educated. The focus is on the synthesis of nursing knowledge and skills with knowledge and skills from the humanities and sciences. Preparation for practice includes experiences in primary, second - ary, and tertiary health care with clients from various age and cultural groups and socioeco - nomic strata. The curriculum is based on the Neu - man Systems Model, which addresses stressors to the client system. Undergraduate curriculum sequence The undergraduate curriculum begins with four quarters of preclinical work, which forms the general education and science base for nursing. These quarters may be completed at any accred - ited college or university. After completion of an additional eight quarters at Loma Linda Universi - ty, the student is eligible to receive the B.S. degree and is prepared for professional nursing practice at the baccalaureate level. The clinical experience develops the student's technical and theoretical capabilities in a progressive manner and within the context of the nursing process: assessment, analysis, planning, implementing, and evaluat - ing. Most of the baccalaureate nursing major is in the upper division, where clinical experience is gained in a broad variety of settings. Integral com - ponents of upper division courses are leadership concepts and skills, research, health promotion, and activities that foster collaboration in planning health care with the family and all members of the health care team. three b .s . degree options 1. Standard (generic) B.S. degree program Students must complete all prerequisite courses prior to starting clinical courses. 2. Returning RN (RN/B.S.) program The returning RN may complete a bacca - laureate degree in four quarters of full-time course work. Part-time schooling is also 388 UNIVERSITY CATALOG possible.

All students on the B.S. or B.A. track will be eligible to take the NCLEX-RN at the end of five quarters. No Loma Linda degree is given. Ap - plicants to either of these tracks should expect to carry very intensive academic loads. Because of this, students in these tracks must maintain a 3.0 G.P .A. each quarter. Any student in this track who receives a grade of B- or below will be returned to the regular schedule (the standard Bachelor of Science degree program) at the beginning of the next quarter.

Graduates join other nursing leaders in furthering the devel - opment of nursing science and improving health care delivery throughout the world. the CU rriCULU m The Ph.D. degree is offered as a summers-only program on campus at Loma Linda University, with selected online courses during the academic year. Completion of dissertation will follow. This schedule is designed to accommodate the needs of adult learners who are either full-time students or part-time students with ongoing commitment to professional work during the academic year. The core courses of the program are taught during four summer intensive sessions. Concentration and elective courses may be taken at Loma Linda University or through the *NEXus partnership; or a limited number of approved units may be trans - ferred from another university. The doctoral degree program is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of knowledge development within the discipline of nursing through philosophical, theoretical, and scien - tific methods of inquiry. The core courses of the program emphasize these three areas. In addition to the core courses, each student is encouraged to select an individually focused area of concentra - tion that will support the student's chosen area of expertise in nursing and that will focus her or his area of advanced inquiry. The area of con - centration may fit established research programs of School of Nursing faculty and may also take advantage of graduate courses throughout the University. The credit requirement is 90 quarter units beyond the Master of Science degree. Addition - ally, LLU Scholars Seminar is required during the academic year while away from the Loma Linda University campus. The seminar focus is to integrate concentration and elective courses in the foundation for a dissertation at the University and to maintain momentum during the program. The program may be completed in four-to-seven years. NEXus is a partnership among select West - ern Institute of Nursing institutions to facilitate enrollment in doctoral courses not available on the student's home campus. Through NEXus, the institutions have identified courses that are avail - able at a distance and open for enrollments from partner institutions. Progression C riteria The following sequential elements are required for progression in the doctoral program: 1. Area of concentration developed and ap - proval of student's proposed academic plan by the end of the first year of full-time study. 2. Written and oral qualifying examination after completion of all required course work. 3. Advancement to candidacy. 4. Successful defense of research proposal. 5. Successful defense of dissertation.

William Hughes, Ph.D.Dean, School of Pharmacy School Foundations 419 School Foundations history In 1994, a school of pharmacy was proposed to the Loma Linda University Board of Trustees; and in 1995, the board voted to continue to approve in principle the establishment of a school of phar - macy. On September 19, 2002, the pioneering class of 2006 began their study in the new School of Pharmacy. In July 2007, the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education granted full accreditation status to the School of Pharmacy. Mission, Goals, and Values oUr m ission The mission of the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy is to continue the teaching and heal - ing ministry of Jesus by: Educating competent, caring pharmacists who will serve as integral members of the health care team; Expanding through research the develop - ment of therapeutic regimens that will advance the knowledge and technology available for the treatment of disease; and Providing high-quality pharmaceutical care to all those within the global sphere of influ - ence of Loma Linda University. The School of Pharmacy is committed to the education of pharmacists of the highest ethical and professional standards to deliver competent and compassionate pharmaceutical care. A diverse and dynamic educational environment produces students who are practitioners, health profession - als, and providers of humanitarian service to a global community. Graduates will be dedicated to lifelong learning; developing new knowledge; advancing standards of practice; and integrating physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of health.oUr goaL s The goals of the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy are to: Provide pharmaceutical care in a global com - munity. Expand and disseminate pharmaceutical knowledge through research and scholarly activities. Promote integrity and high ethical standards in conjunction with empathic attitudes that contribute to the well-being of patients and society. Engender and nurture the desire to serve mankind. Create an educational environment sup - portive of diverse populations and learning styles. Demonstrate pharmacy leadership within the University and the region. Encourage cultivation of self-education hab - its that foster lifelong learning. Instill positive personal health lifestyles that promote wholeness, wellness, and spiritual values. Incorporate educational techniques and tech - nologies that best serve student learning. Promote responsible management of health care resources and the environment. oUr vaLU es The School of Pharmacy centers its academic and cocurricular activities around seven values. These are: Compassion\u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and sufferings of others. Among the most memorable depic - tions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which Loma Linda University has taken as a central symbol of its work. Excellence\u2014The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. Humility\u2014The willingness to serve others in a sacrificial manner, and the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance.420 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Integrity\u2014The quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are well-considered and match one's actions. Integ - rity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. Purity/Self-Control\u2014The commitment to be morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions. Freedom\u2014The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery but to freedom. Justice\u2014The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could be genuine only when it led the believers to \"seek justice, rescue the op - pressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for in - forming themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matricu - lation, and graduation.

Applicants are not required to disclose the nature of their disability(ies), if any, to the Admissions Commit - tee. However, any applicant with questions about these technical standards is strongly encouraged to discuss his/her specific issue(s) with the Assis - tant Dean, Student Affairs and Admissions prior to the interview process. If appropriate, and upon the request of the applicant, reasonable accom - modations will be provided. This commitment also holds for current students who experience changes in health or abilities while enrolled in the program. The School of Pharmacy recognizes that certain student disabilities can be accommodated with - out compromising the standards required by the college and the integrity of the curriculum. Technological compensation can be made for some handicaps in these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The School is committed to the develop - ment of innovative and creative ways of open - ing the curriculum to competitive and qualified disabled candidates, while protecting the care of patients. The use of a trained intermediary means that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by General Regulations 423 someone else's power of selection and observation. Therefore, third parties cannot be used to assist students in accomplishing curricular require - ments in the skill areas specified above. observation Students must be able to observe demonstrations and conduct exercises in a variety of areas related to contemporary pharmacy practice, including but not limited to monitoring of drug response and preparation of specialty dosage forms and experi - ments in the basic sciences. A student must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand, noting nonverbal as well as verbal signals. The student must be able to observe and interpret presented information. Specific vision-related requirements include, but are not limited to the following abilities: visualizing and dis - criminating findings on monitoring tests; read - ing written and illustrated material; observing demonstrations in the classroom or laboratory, including projected images; observing and differ - entiating changes in body movement; observing anatomic structures; discriminating numbers and patterns associated with diagnostic and monitor - ing instruments and tests; observing a patient's environment; and competently using instruments for monitoring drug response. Communication A student should be able to speak to, hear, and listen to patients in order to elicit information; de - scribe changes in mood, activity, and posture; and perceive verbal as well as nonverbal communica - tions. Students must be able to relate effectively and sensitively with patients and their caregivers and or partners, and convey a sense of compassion and empathy. Students must be able to commu - nicate effectively and sensitively with patients and faculty and staff in the School of Pharmacy. Communication includes speech, reading, writ - ing, hearing, and computer literacy. Students must be able to communicate quickly, effectively and efficiently in oral and written English with all members of the health care team. Specific require - ments include but are not limited to the following abilities: communicating rapidly and clearly with members of the health care team individually and collectively; eliciting a thorough medication and medical history; and communicating complex findings in appropriate terms that are understood by patients and their caregivers, partners, and various members of the health care team (fellow students, pharmacists, faculty and staff members, physicians, nurses, aides, therapists, social work - ers, and others). Students must be able to prepare and communicate concise but complete summa - ries of individual activities and decisions; as well as complex, prolonged encounters with patients. Students must be able to complete forms or appro - priately document activities according to direc - tions in a complete and timely fashion. motor coordination and function Students should have sufficient motor function and skills necessary to perform basic tasks in the practice of pharmacy and to elicit information from patients by various screening maneuvers. A student should be able to execute motor move - ments reasonably required to participate in the general care and emergency treatment of patients. They must be able to respond promptly to ur - gencies within the practice setting and must not hinder the ability of their co-workers to provide prompt care. Examples of such emergency treat - ment reasonably required of pharmacists include arriving quickly when called, administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, application of pressure to stop bleeding, participating in the initiation of appropriate procedures, rapidly and accurately preparing appropriate emergency medication, and the preparation of sterile intrave - nous medications. Such actions require coordina - tion of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Students must have sufficient sensory and motor function to monitor drug re - sponses and to prepare and or dispense pharma - ceuticals. A candidate should be able to perform basic laboratory tests (e.g., blood glucose and lipid levels); administer immunizations (intramuscular and subcutaneous); compound sterile and non - sterile dosage forms; use current technology for drug information evaluation; and read EKGs, drug blood levels, and other laboratory results. It is also 424 UNIVERSITY CATALOG necessary for the student to be able to access drug and disease information sources (both paper and electronic) within a reasonable time frame and re - cord data correctly so that it is clearly understood by other health professionals. intellectual, conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities A student should possess sufficient intellectual, conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities to complete a rigorous and intense didactic and experiential curriculum. These abilities include measurement, calculation, rational reasoning, problem analysis and solving, decision making, judgment, numerical recognition, information in - tegration, and solution synthesis.

Especially important is the appropriate and rapid calculation of dosages for a variety of patient-specific conditions such as renal or hepatic failure, obesity, cardiac or respira - tory arrest, etc. Additionally, calculations involv - ing appropriate dilution or reconstitution of drug products, electrolytes, etc., must be made accurate - ly and quickly. Problem solving and critical skills demanded of all pharmacists require all of the above-mentioned intellectual abilities and must be performed quickly, especially in emergency situ - ations. The ability to incorporate new information from peers or teachers and to locate and evaluate new information from the literature to be used appropriately in formulating assessments and pharmaceutical care plans is essential, as is good judgment in patient assessment and therapeutic planning for disease management. Students must be able to identify and acknowledge the limits of their knowledge to others when appropriate and must be able to recognize when the limits of their knowledge indicate further study or investigation is essential before participating in decision mak - ing. A student must be fully alert and attentive at all times in clinical settings. behavioral and social attributes Empathy, integrity, honesty, concern for oth - ers, kindness, patience, good interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are required personal qualities. Students must possess the emotional and mental health required for full use of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judg - ment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the screening and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients of differing cultures and backgrounds. Students must also be able to develop mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients and their caregivers and partners, providing comfort and reassurance when appropriate. Students must possess adequate endurance to be able to tolerate physically, intellectually, and emotionally taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress or with distractions. At times, this requires the ability to be aware of and appropriately react to one's own immediate emo - tional responses and environment. For example, students must maintain a professional demeanor and organization in the face of long hours and personal fatigue, dissatisfied patients, and tired colleagues. Students must develop the skills necessary to instruct and supervise technical personnel assist - ing with the delivery of pharmaceutical services. Students are expected to accept appropriate sug - gestions and criticism and if necessary, respond quickly, appropriately and cooperatively by modi - fication of behavior. Empathy, patience, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are personal qualities that should be assessed during the admission and education processes. ethical values Students must demonstrate the highest level of professional demeanor and behavior and must perform in an ethical manner in all dealings with peers, faculty, staff, and patients. Students must also be able to develop professional relationships with patients and their caregivers and partners while protecting patient confidentiality. Students must also meet the expected ethical standards set forth by the pharmacy profession. Good moral character, decent values, and principled judgment are paramount attributes for being a professional.

The Office of Student Affairs works closely with class leaders\u2014assisting with class issues, helping to plan events, and facilitating a strong communica - tion link to and from students. Each class also elects a full-time faculty member to serve as class advisor. The advisor's function is to serve as men - tor, keep abreast of class issues, and maintain an open communication link with the director of the Office of Student Affairs. aCademi C Po LiCies and ProC edUres Curriculum outcome objectives The Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy student learning outcomes are to: Perform the functions necessary to provide patient-centered care. Perform the functions necessary to provide population-based care. Perform safe medication distribution and handling. Provide public health services. Apply the Loma Linda University phi - losophy of wholeness in their personal and professional lives.428 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Apply core biomedical knowledge to patient- centered care. student progression The curriculum is designed to be followed in a stepwise, block manner. All prerequisites must be completed before a student can enroll in a course. Students must pass all of the professional courses for the current year before enrolling in courses for the succeeding years. In addition, each student must pass the end-of-year comprehensive assess - ment examination. The academic standing of each student is reviewed quarterly by the Office of Academic Affairs. Students who fail to meet the minimum standards will be notified, in writing, by the Office of Academic Affairs. A minimum grade of C- is required to pass all pharmacy courses and electives. Following a course failure, a student's progression will stop; and s/he will be placed on leave-of-absence status for two academic quarters (not including sum - mer). The student is responsible for completing and filing with the Office of University Records the appropriate paperwork. Failure to do so may result in administrative dismissal. A student will have a maximum of six calendar years from the initial date of matriculation to com - plete the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. end-of-year assessment examinations One of the requirements for progressing from one professional year to the next is passing a comprehensive, year-end, qualifying examina - tion. These examinations are prepared by curricu - lar year-specific teams of faculty members. The results of the end-of-year assessment examination will be communicated by the PY1, PY2, PY3 cur - ricular year team chair to the Office of Academic Affairs for communication to individual students. Failure to pass these examinations will delay pro - gression and enrollment in the subsequent year. Students who fail the end-of-year-assessment examination on the first attempt will retake a different, but similar in difficulty, examina - tion as scheduled by the Assessment Com - mittee. Students who fail the second attempt (first retake) must complete an oral examination (second retake) administered per the Assess - ment Committee's requirements. The oral ex - amination will be conducted by the curricu - lar year-specific team of faculty members. The oral examination will focus on establish - ing a student's competency in the subject matter for the PY1, PY2, PY3 curricular year as appropriate to the specific students. The results will be communicated in writing to the associate dean for academic affairs. Students who fail the third attempt (the oral examination) will not progress to the next professional year. grading system grade and grade P oints The following grades and grade points are used in the School of Pharmacy. All courses taught are approved for letter grades only. The exceptions are forum and professional development, which will be graded on an S/U (satisfactory/unsatisfactory) basis. The grades and corresponding grade-point scales are: A 4.0 Outstanding performance 90-92 A- 87-89 B+ 3.3 83-86 B 3.0 Satisfactory performance 80-82 B- 2.7 77-79 C+ 2.3 73-76 C 2.0 70-72 1.7 Marginal 67-69 D+ 1.3 Unsatisfactory performance 60-66 D 1.0 <60 F 0.0 S 0.0 Satisfactory performance in pharmacy forum or professional development. U 0.0 Unsatisfactory performance in pharmacy forum or professional development. Student Life 429 incomplete grade The notation \"I\" (incomplete) in a course is given only for circumstances beyond a student's control. It will not be granted as a remedy for course over - load, failure on a final examination, absence from a final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. In order to receive an incomplete, the student must initiate a request to receive a grade of \"I\" by completing a \"Petition to Receive Incomplete Grade\" form and stating the reason for the re - quest. If this request is approved, the instructor will report an \"I\" as well as the grade the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the prescribed time limit. An \"I\" notation must be changed to an earned letter grade before the end of the following term (excluding summer sessions). Failure to complete course requirements will cause the incomplete work to be counted as a zero and factored in with the existing grade to calculate the final grade for the course. grade changes A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in computing or recording. Such changes may be processed only up to the end of the following term. In order to satisfactorily complete a course for which a grade of less than C- has been earned, the student must repeat the course. This includes attending lecture and/or laboratory sessions as re - quired, completing the assigned work, and taking any required examinations. Both the original and repeat course grades are entered on the perma - nent transcript record, but only the second (repeat) course grade is used to compute the grade-point average (G.P .A.). A course may be repeated only once. grade appeals Every student has the right to receive a grade assigned upon a fair and unprejudiced evalua - tion based on a method that is neither arbitrary nor capricious. Furthermore, instructors have the right to assign a grade based on any method that is professionally acceptable, communicated to all students in the course syllabus, and applied equally. Instructors have the responsibility to provide careful evaluation and timely assignment of appropriate grades. Course and project grad - ing methods should be explained to students at the beginning of the term. Academic integrity assumes that the judgment of the instructor of record is authoritative and that the final grades assigned are correct. A grade appeal is confined to charges of unfair action toward an individual student and may not involve a challenge of an instructor's grading stan - dard. A student has the right to expect thoughtful and clearly defined approaches to grading, but it must be recognized that varied standards and individual approaches to grading are valid. The grade appeal considers whether a grade was de - termined in a fair and appropriate manner; it does not attempt to grade or regrade individual assign - ments or projects. It is incumbent on the student to substantiate the claim that his or her final grade represents unfair treatment. Only the final grade in a course may be appealed. In the absence of compelling reasons\u2014such as clerical error, preju - dice, or arbitrariness\u2014the grade assigned by the instructor of record is to be considered final. In a grade appeal, only arbitrariness, prejudice, and/or error will be considered as legitimate grounds for an appeal. Arbitrariness: The grade awarded represents such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the instructor did not actually exercise profes - sional judgment. Prejudice: The grade awarded was motivated by ill will and is not indicative of the stu - dent's academic performance. Error: The instructor made a mistake in fact. The grade appeal procedure applies only when a student initiates a grade appeal and not when the instructor decides to change a grade on his or her own initiative. This procedure does not cover instances where students have been assigned grades based on academic dishonesty or academic 430 UNIVERSITY CATALOG misconduct. Also excluded from this procedure are grade appeals alleging discrimination, harass - ment, or retaliation in violation of Loma Linda University's sexual harassment policy. The grade appeal procedure strives to resolve, in a collegial manner, a disagreement between stu - dent and instructor concerning the assignment of a grade. The intent is to provide a mechanism for the informal discussion of differences of opinion and for the formal adjudication by a grade ap - peal panel only when necessary. In all instances, students who believe that an appropriate grade has not been assigned must first seek to resolve the matter informally with the instructor of re - cord. If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the student must proceed with a grade appeal in the procedure outlined below. The grade appeal process must be started within ten working days after the end of the academic quarter in which the disputed grade is received. student grade-appeal process Step 1. A student who wishes to question a grade must discuss the matter first with the instruc - tor within ten working days after the end of the academic quarter in which the disputed grade is received. In most cases, the discussion between the student and the instructor should suffice, and the matter will not need to be carried further. The student should be aware that the only valid basis for grade appeal beyond Step 1 is to establish that an instructor assigned a grade that was arbitrary, prejudiced, or in error. Step 2. If the student's concerns remain un - resolved after Step 1, the student may submit a written request to meet with the appropriate department chair within five working days of speaking with the instructor. In situations where the instructor of record is a department chair or associate dean, then the dean will serve as the appropriate department head in this step. The appropriate department chair will meet within five working days with the student, and, if the department chair believes that the complaint may have merit, s/he will meet with the instructor. After consultation with the department chair, the instructor may choose to let the grade remain, or change it. The department head will then commu -nicate the result to the student and instructor. Step 3. If the matter remains unresolved after Step 2, the student should submit to the dean within five working days a written request that includes all supporting documents. The dean will appoint a grade appeal panel to review the request. The panel may require any or all indi - viduals associated with the appeal to appear. The panel is charged with determining whether the grade was assigned in a fair and appropriate man - ner, or whether clear and convincing evidence of unfair treatment\u2014such as arbitrariness, prejudice, and/or error\u2014might justify changing the grade. The panel will make its decisions based on a ma - jority vote. If the panel concludes that the grade was assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, it will report its conclusion in writing to the student and instructor, and the matter will be considered closed. If the panel determines that compelling reasons exist for changing the grade, it would re - quest that the instructor make the change, provid - ing the instructor with a written explanation of its reasons. Should the instructor decline, s/he must provide a written explanation for refusing. The panel, after considering the instructor's explana - tion and upon again concluding that it would be unjust to allow the original grade to stand, will then determine what grade is to be assigned. The new grade may be higher than, the same as, or lower than the original grade. Having made this determination, each panel member will sign the grade change form and transmit it to the Office of University Records. The instructor and the student will be advised of the new grade. Under no cir - cumstances may the grade be changed except by the original faculty member or the panel. Should the panel conclude that the instructor's written explanation justifies the original grade, the panel will report this in writing to the student and the instructor; and the matter will be closed. Class attendance Student attendance in classes is considered to be the cornerstone of professional behavior and is expected in all classes. Instructors may require attendance in class as a condition of passing a course or as part of the grade a student earns. Student Life 431 Chapel In keeping with the commitment to the mis - sion of the University, all School of Pharmacy students are required to attend a weekly chapel service. The chapel service is a core component of the wholeness curriculum at Loma Linda Univer - sity. By setting aside time each week for a chapel program, the University seeks to emphasize the value it places on spiritual development, corporate worship, and community. This also reaffirms the University's commitment to the ideals upon which it was founded. Chapel services provide opportu - nities for members of the University community to benefit from programming that integrates faith and learning. Regular attendance is required at the weekly chapel services, as well as the daily services during the quarterly Week of Devotion. Students are expected to fulfill this requirement as they would any other component of the cur - riculum. Pharmacy forum Pharmacy forum is a scheduled time during which professors and students come together to discuss pertinent issues and address professional topics that enhance the student's academic and professional experience. This is considered part of the pharmacy curriculum, and each quarter students receive a Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory grade for forum. Attendance is required and is a component of the forum grade. dean's list and honor roll The Office of Academic Affairs compiles a list of students who have demonstrated their academic excellence by achieving an outstanding grade-point average each quarter. A student who earns a 3.30-3.69 grade-point average, with no incomplete grades, during a term is given Honor Roll stand - ing. A student who earns a 3.70 or better grade-point average, with no incomplete grades, is given Dean's List standing.honors and awards The School of Pharmacy awards excellence in scholastic attainment and leadership abilities. Awards are available to students whose per - formance and attitudes reflect the mission and goals of Loma Linda University and the School of Pharmacy. Students demonstrating excellence in scholarship, professionalism, and leadership abil - ity may be nominated for recognition. Selection of students for the following awards is a function of the Honors and Awards Committee with input from the faculty. The PRESIDENT'S AWARD is given annually to a graduating student who has demonstrated excellence in scholarship and community service within the framework of commitment to the high - est ideals of the University. The DEAN'S AWARD is given annually to a graduating student who has demonstrated excel - lence in scholarship. The WIL ALEXANDER WHOLE PERSON CARE AWARD is given annually to a graduating student who has demonstrated superior commitment to helping others. DEAN'S SCHOLARSHPS are given annually to the top 3 students academically in the first three years of the Doctor of Pharmacy program. In addition, the School of Pharmacy receives funding annually from a variety of organiza - tions dedicated to assisting the School in helping students meet the financial obligations for their education. These funds are distributed to students who have demonstrated a strong commitment to their studies as well as a commitment to the val - ues of the institution. Performance levels good a Cademi C standing To remain in good academic standing, pharmacy students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade-point average of 2.30. Failure to maintain good academic standing will result in action by the Office of Academic Affairs. In addition to the 432 UNIVERSITY CATALOG cumulative G.P .A., a grade of at least a C- must be earned in any course for which credit is to be ap - plied towards completion of the requirements of the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. academic probation Each student's academic status will be reviewed at the end of every academic quarter, including cumulative G.P .A. as reported by the Office of University Records. A student with a cumulative G.P .A. of less than 2.30 will be placed on academic probation and will receive a letter from the Office of Academic Affairs. This written notice of aca - demic probation will also include a notice that failure to reach the required G.P .A. by the end of the next two successive academic terms will result in the student being dismissed from the school. Academic probation will also result when a student receives less than a C- in any advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) during the PY4 year. Each student on academic probation is required to meet with his/her faculty advisor by the end of the second week of the probationary term to develop and agree to, in writing, an academic improvement plan (AIP). The AIP may include mandatory study/ advising sessions, mandatory class attendance, and/or other stipulations aimed at encouraging and supporting student academic success. A copy of a student's AIP will be main - tained in his/her advising folder, and a copy of the AIP will also be forwarded to the Office of Academic Affairs. The faculty advisor is expected to inform the Office of Academic Affairs of the student's compliance with this policy and his/her academic progress. Failure by the student to seek appropriate assistance from his/her faculty advisor will not be accepted as a valid reason to stop the imposition of the appropriate academic probationary or other status. Academic probation status will remain in effect for two consecutive academic quarters. Upon completion of each academic quarter, a student on academic probation will receive in writing from the Office of Academic Affairs a notice of his/her current standing. It is expected that students on probation will make progress toward good aca - demic standing at the conclusion of each academic quarter. At the conclusion of the second consecu - tive academic quarter, the student must have achieved good academic standing. Failure to do so will result in dismissal. Academic probation will be lifted when the stu - dent's cumulative G.P .A. rises above 2.30 or when the student successfully completes the type of APPE course previously failed. There is no appeal process associated with academic probation. academic dismissal Since courses may not be attempted more than twice (i.e., a course may be repeated only once)\u2014including APPEs\u2014grades of D+, D, D-, F, and W are considered to be attempts to complete degree program courses. Failure to complete any course in the program within the limits of good academic standing will result in dismissal from the pro - gram. A dismissed student will receive written notifi - cation from the dean of the School of Pharmacy. The notice will include procedures for appeal; and notice of loss of registration, financial aid, hous - ing, etc. It is the student's responsibility to arrange with the Office of University Records for formal withdrawal within one week of receiving the writ - ten notification. Dismissed students are required to turn in any school or University ID badges and vacate University residence halls. The school will also notify the California State Board of Pharmacy for termination of the student's pharmacy intern license. readmission of dismissed students A dismissed student may reapply and be con - sidered for readmission. To be considered for readmission, the student must petition (in writ - ing) the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee. Petitions are due in the dean's office by the designated date (following each term), as published and sent to each dismissed student. After review of the written appeal, the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee may uphold the dismissal or may recommend the stu - dent for readmission with or without conditions/stipulations. The Admissions Committee reviews each case separately and reserves the right to Student Life 433 determine the provisions/ conditions for each indi - vidual situation. A student who has been dismissed twice is not eligible for readmission to the same degree program for a period of twelve months, or until s/he demonstrates the ability to succeed through course work taken at another institution. Fol - lowing this twelve-month period, a student may apply for readmission by following the above procedures. The dismissal decisions made by the Academic Standing and Professionalism Com - mittee may be appealed. All appeals must be in writing and submitted to the dean of the School of Pharmacy by the established/stated deadline. A student who questions whether the School of Pharmacy has followed prescribed process with regard to his/her grievance may request the Office of the President to conduct a review. Withdrawal from the program It is the student's responsibility to begin the withdrawal process from a course or the curricu - lum in a timely manner. It is important for the stu - dent to seek counseling or guidance from his/her faculty advisor or other administrative persons regarding a situation that may negatively impact upon academic performance. Failure to seek ap - propriate assistance will not be accepted as a valid reason to stop the imposition of the appropriate academic penalties. If a student finds it necessary to withdraw dur - ing the course of a quarter, the Office of Student Affairs must be notified in writing. Arrangements for formal withdrawal must then be made in the Office of University Records by completing and submitting a \"Withdrawal from the Program\" form. Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term are not included in the student's permanent record, and tuition is refunded. Refer to the University's refund policy in the Financial Information section of the Student Handbook for information that applies after the first two weeks of the quarter. An exit interview with the School of Pharmacy administration is required. experiential education The School of Pharmacy participates in the Cali -fornia Board of Pharmacy's approved supervised experiential program. The school will certify 600 of the required 1,500 hours of supervised experi - ence required to sit for the licensing examination. Successful completion of the School of Pharmacy's didactic and experiential programs, and passing scores on the North American Pharmacist Licen - sure Examination (NAPLEX) and a law examina - tion or equivalent, are required in order to become a registered pharmacist (RPh) in the state(s) of choice. The experiential program consists of a variety of introductory and advanced pharmacy practice experiences designed to provide the student with professional experience through the use of a struc - tured and supervised program of study. Students participating in the experiential program will receive a Loma Linda University School of Phar - macy Experiential Program Manual. Guidelines and policies are listed in this manual and must be adhered to in order to successfully complete the program. Didactic education is a systematic approach intended to convey instruction and information (classroom, laboratory, recitation, etc.). Experien - tial education is related to or derived from provid - ing experiences in real-life professional settings. In pharmacy education, the experiential compo - nent is designed to provide in-depth exposure to and active participation in selected pharmacy practice settings. Pharmacy students are exposed to prescription processing, compounding, docu - menting services, obtaining drug histories, drug therapy monitoring, counseling, evaluating drug usage, drug distribution systems, and other rel - evant pharmacy practice activities. Under the philosophy of pharmaceutical care, the School of Pharmacy offers introductory phar - macy practice experiences (IPPE) in the PYs 1-3 to enhance practice skills and prepare students to function as members of a health care team. The advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) in the PY4 are designed to help students integrate and refine the skills learned in the first three years of pharmacy (didactic and experiential) course work. The purpose of the experiential education pro - gram is to apply didactic knowledge to pharmacy practice. The ultimate goal of the experiential 434 UNIVERSITY CATALOG program is to produce well-rounded, competent, caring, and responsible pharmacists who can deliver exemplary pharmaceutical care, as well as communicate effectively with diverse patients and other health care professionals. exPerientia L ed UCation reQUirements The majority of the student's time during experi - ential courses is out-of-the-classroom activity un - der the direct supervision of a School of Pharmacy preceptor. When a student is off campus during an IPPE or APPE rotation, Loma Linda Univer - sity's code of conduct and the guidelines found in the School of Pharmacy Student Policies and Procedures Manual are still in effect throughout the completion of this experience. If experiential site regulations and policies differ from University policies, the site policies supersede. In addition to the above-mentioned guidelines, the follow - ing items are to be followed by all professional pharmacy students assigned to experiential sites or rotations. Attendance is mandatory. Punctuality is expected, and excessive tardiness will not be tolerated. Students must maintain their University email account and are required to check the account at least daily to keep apprised of important information or announcements. All experiential educational assignments are made through the Division of Experiential Education and are the responsibility of the directors of experiential education. No stu - dent is allowed to change rotation sites. Students are not to function as an agent or employee of the site. They must identify themselves as pharmacy students from Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. While participating in this graded experi - ence, students shall not, under any circum - stances, receive financial remuneration from the experiential site. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in suspension and removal from the rotation and receipt of a failing grade in the course.All financial obligations associated with the student's pharmacy education are the responsibil - ity of the student. These responsibilities include transportation, food, lodging, and any other incidental costs related to off-site assignments. Concurrent employment during the experiential experience does not exclude or excuse students from any responsibilities associated with course requirements. The student must possess a valid driver's license and is responsible for transporta - tion to and from sites. Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy stu - dents are required to dress and act professionally at all times. This expectation extends to experi - ential educational activities where the student is not physically on the campus but receives instruc - tion and guidance through a School of Pharmacy preceptor. The Division of Experiential Education requires all students to adhere to the School of Pharmacy dress code and to wear their Loma Linda Univer - sity identification card and short white laboratory coat at all times while at the experiential site. The laboratory coat must be white, clean, and freshly pressed/ironed. Students who attend out of dress code will be considered absent by the preceptor and sent home to fulfill dress code requirements prior to returning to the practice site. In addition to the general school requirements, other rules may apply for students who are off site. If the experiential site has special attire or dress code requirements, the more stringent of the dress code requirements prevails, whether that of Loma Linda University or of the off-site institu - tion. Pharma Cy PraCtiCe ex Perien Ce In order to complete the curriculum success - fully, graduate from the School of Pharmacy, and become a licensed pharmacist, the student is required to complete a minimum of 1,500 hours of practice experience. The director of experiential education coordinates both introductory phar - macy practice experience (IPPE) and advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE). Student Life 435 introd UCtory P harma Cy PraCtiCe exPerien Ce (iPPe) The goals of the introductory pharmacy practice experience are to sharpen students' clinical skills through direct patient-care activities in commu - nity, institutional, and ambulatory care settings; to introduce the student to different career opportu - nities in pharmacy; and to assist them in deter - mining their career choices. Under the tutelage of a School of Pharmacy preceptor, who is also a licensed pharmacist, the student will be provided opportunities to apply didactic knowledge to patient care in community, institutional, and am - bulatory care settings early on. These experiences will enhance communication, problem-solving, critical-thinking, and decision-making skills through direct patient-care P harma Cy PraCtiCe exPerien Ce (aPPe) Students are required to complete a total of six advanced pharmacy practice experiences in spe - cific clinical areas. Four experiences (each lasting six weeks) will be in required fields of hospital practice, ambulatory care, internal medicine, and clinical community practice. Two experiences will be in elective fields (see curriculum section). Prere QUisites for advan Ced Pharma Cy PraCtiCe ex Perien Ces In order to progress to the advanced pharmacy practice experiences, a student must meet the fol - lowing requirements: Assessment examination: Students must pass the PY3 end-of-year comprehensive assess - ment examination. PY4 standing: Students must achieve PY4 standing as defined by the School of Phar - macy. The Office of Student and Professional Affairs will notify the director of experien - tial education when students successfully complete all PY3 work. Immunizations: Students must safeguard themselves and be sure that all University-required immunizations are up to date. Stu -dents are responsible for keeping the records of their own immunizations accessible. For the protection of patients and the students themselves, it is highly recommended that students receive the influenza vaccine in Oc - tober during their PY4 year. Some sites may require this immunization. HIPAA certificate: All students are required to complete HIPAA training and obtain a certificate of completion annually. Tuberculosis screening: Students must be screened and cleared for tuberculosis (complete a one or two-step PPD test, de - pending on the practice site requirement) during summer of PY4. A chest X-ray may also be required. Students shall follow specific instructions provided by the Divi - sion of Experiential Education. A record of tuberculosis-screening clearance must be on file in the office of the director of experiential education. Background check: Facilities require a back - ground check of all personnel, including stu - dents who are placed on site for experiential education. Some institutions may require the student to sign a confidentiality agreement or disclosure statement. Background checks are required for entry into the School of Pharmacy. Periodic review and update may be required during the program. Additional - ly, an updated background check is required prior to starting APPE. Random drug screening: Random drug screening may be required for some practice settings. This screening may be above and beyond school-mandated screening. Intern license: Students must hold a valid California pharmacist intern license throughout the advanced pharmacy practice experiences. CPR/First aid: Students must hold valid cer - tification in both CPR and first aid. Effective dates must be current through PY4. Student health card: Students must carry the Loma Linda University student health insur - ance card with them at all times. CV: Students must present a copy of their professional CV to the site preceptor at each APPE location.436 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Licensing Pharma Cy intern L iCense All School of Pharmacy students must have a current California pharmacist intern license. Students begin the application process prior to the start of PY1. During the first-year orientation, ap - plications for this license are completed, including a $75 payment by check to the California Board of Pharmacy. The Office of Student Affairs submits these applications to the California Board of Phar - macy. All students involved in introductory phar - macy practice experiences (IPPE) and advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) must hold a current pharmacy intern license. Information about the pharmacy intern license can be found on the web page <www.pharmacy.ca.gov/pdfs2/intern_application_pkt.pdf>. It is the student's responsibility to keep his/ her pharmacy intern license current and valid. The Board of Pharmacy must be notified of any address, student status, or name change. A pho - tocopy of the student's valid pharmacy intern license must be on file in the school's Division of Experiential Education. Pharma Cy intern ho Urs The California State Board of Pharmacy requires each student to accrue 1,500 hours of accept - able intern experience. The School of Pharmacy's advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) will fulfill 600 of these hours. The remaining 900 hours must be completed outside the School of Pharmacy curriculum and must consist of em - ployment in a pharmacy under the immediate, direct, and personal supervision of a pharmacist. This experience must be predominantly related to preparing, processing, and dispensing pre - scription products; compounding prescriptions; keeping records; and making reports required by California and federal regulations. graduation requirements A candidate for the degree of Doctor of Pharma - cy at Loma Linda University shall meet all of the following requirements: Satisfaction of all requirements for admis - sion.

School Foundations history The school's foundation was laid in 1948 with the organization of the School of Tropical and Preventive Medicine, the purpose of which was to provide a base for research and teaching. In 1964, plans were made for faculty and facilities to meet the requirements of the Committee on Profes - sional Education of the American Public Health Association (APHA). Three years later, the School of Nutrition and Dietetics (established in 1922) and the Division of Public Health and Tropical Medi - cine were accredited by AOHA and organized under the name Loma Linda University School of Public Health. This name was changed to School of Health in October 1970 to reflect more clearly the school's emphasis on lifestyle. In response to changing societal perceptions and definitions of \"public health,\" the original name, School of Public Health, was readopted in August 1987. The Center for Health Promotion, the Department of Preventive Medicine, and the Preventive Medi - cine Group were merged into the School of Public Health in 1990. The expanded resources realized by this merger stimulated further growth and development of the school to provide a dynamic learning and research environment for its stu - dents and faculty. aCC reditation The school has maintained continuous accredita - tion since it was accredited at its inception in 1967 by the American Public Health Association. It is currently accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health, 800 Eye Street NW, Suite 202, Washington, DC 20001-1397. The school is also a member of the Association of Schools of Public Health.446 UNIVERSITY CATALOG General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for in - forming themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matricula - tion, and graduation.

From the water people drink to the air they breathe to the food they eat, these health professionals are responsible for ensuring that safe and healthy conditions exist in the community and in the workplace, and that vulnerable areas of the environment are protected from contamination. They function as first re - sponders in some public safety situations; but they also engage in routine activities, such as: commu - nity education or preparation for natural disasters or other threats; enforcement of health and safety standards; hazardous waste management; water quality assurance; inspections of recreational ar - eas; and many other protection functions. Career options are varied, including employment within nongovernmental and governmental agencies, industrial and service firms, the health care indus - try, or consulting companies. department goal The Department of Environmental and Occu - Learning Environment 447 pational Health endeavors to train expert profes - sionals committed to public health protection and environmental stewardship with a broad understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of environmental and occupational hazards; and with the skills to design sustainable approaches to prevent and manage them. Learner outcomes The academic and curricular philosophy of the department is built upon themes of environmen - tal health quality and assurance, environmental stewardship and sustainability, and the vocation for social justice intrinsic to the history of public health practice. Graduates are expected to dem - onstrate competency in six areas of responsibility and leadership: 1. Assess environmental conditions that pres - ent actual or potential health hazards to employees and the general public; and rec - ommend cost-effective, practical mitigation techniques and monitoring strategies. 2. Manage environmental health programs and professionals. 3. Conduct applied policy and technical re - search that expands the existing knowledge base in the field of environmental and occu - pational health sciences, both in the United States and in international communities. 4. Provide environmental and occupational health-related consultation to local and na - tional governments, international agencies, nongovernmental organizations, industry, private associations, labor organizations, and academic institutions. 5. Advocate for environmental justice and equity on behalf of vulnerable and disadvan - taged subgroups of the population. 6. Meet the eligibility requirements to sit for the registered environmental health special - ist (REHS) examination. department mission The mission of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health is to prepare distin - guished environmental health professionals who can serve local, national, and international com - munities and meet the following standards: Conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner. Serve as qualified, successful environmental health practitioners. Be prepared to enter into advanced or doc - toral degree programs. dePartment of eP idemio Logy and biostatisti Cs Although the science of epidemiology began with the investigation of the infectious disease outbreaks, epidemiologists today consider the modern plagues of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and injuries to be a part of this relatively young discipline. Contemporary epidemiology builds upon the premise that disease or health is not randomly distributed within populations. Epide - miologists, therefore, apply a collection of inves - tigative research methods that permeate all fields of public health in order to identify and isolate the underlying causes of disease and injury, as well as health. The emphasis placed upon the investi - gative process has inspired some to describe the epidemiologist as a medical detective. The diversity of this investigative science is illus - trated by a number of research accomplishments ranging from identification of control and preven - tive measures for AIDS and diabetes mellitus; to etiologic processes important in the development of malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. Other accomplishments of epidemiology include discovery of social and biological mechanisms involved in the spread of measles, AIDS, and pertussis through human populations; and preventive measures for surgical wound and other hospital-acquired infections. Contemporary epidemiologic inquiry ranges from investigation of the roles of prescription medications, nutrition, electromagnetic fields, and pesticides in human cancer; to identification of health benefits of cholesterol reduction, smoking cessation, and use of safety bindings on skis. The efficacy and confirmed success of epidemiol - ogy guarantee an exciting future for those who meet the challenges of this advancing science.448 UNIVERSITY CATALOG The mission of the Department of Epidemiol - ogy and Biostatistics is to prepare professionals to serve local, national, and international com - munities as researchers and consultants qualified to provide an understanding of environmental, genetic, and social characteristics important in disease development and spread; and profes - sionals qualified to select and apply appropriate statistical theories, strategies, and techniques to the solution of research problems. The Department of Epidemiology and Biostatis - tics: 1. Trains students to become professionals in epidemiology and biostatistics. 2. Fosters a spirit of collaboration between stu - dents and faculty by including students in research projects and as teaching assistants. 3. Provides practical research experience\u2014in - cluding presentation of data\u2014through field practice in a public health department or other agency or on one of the research proj - ects within the University. 4. Conducts high-quality research, collaborates on research projects within the school and the University, and develops research col - laboration with other academic and research communities. 5. Provides consultation services regarding research design; and analyzes and interprets results to other groups within the University, the community, and outside agencies. dePartment of gL oba L heaLth description Recent advances in science, technology, and communications have created a rapidly shrinking planet\u2014a veritable global, interconnected vil - lage\u2014with unique opportunities and unparalleled challenges in health and development.

Peace Corps m aster's i nternational Program / m aster of Public h ealth Pea Ce Cor Ps vo LUnteers/ internationa L The Peace Corps was established in 1961 to provide U.S. citizens an opportunity to serve their country in the cause of peace by living and work - ing in developing countries. Over the years as the needs of host countries have evolved, the Peace Corps has continued striving to attract individuals whose education, experience, and cross-cultural sensitivity can address global needs as they arise; and who can facilitate sustainable, community-centered development. After identifying a number of areas in which there was a shortage of person - nel with specialized expertise\u2014including the area of public health\u2014the Peace Corps established the Master's International Program in 1987. This program is designed not only to meet the increas - ing demand from Peace Corps host countries for volunteers with higher levels of education and technical expertise, but also to provide volunteers the opportunity to incorporate Peace Corps ser - vice into graduate education pursuits. Loma Linda University is one of eighty-two universities currently participating in the Master's International Program. It is one of only eleven universities that offers this prestigious program in conjunction with the Master of Public Health de - gree, which includes one of the following empha - ses: environmental health, health promotion and education, global health, maternal-child health, health policy and management, and nutrition. Prospective students must be accepted both by Loma Linda University School of Public Health into the Master of Public Health degree program, and by the Peace Corps into the Master's Interna - tional Program. To join the Peace Corps, the applicant must be a U.S. citizen, at least 18 years of age, and in good physical health. For information regarding additional eligibility criteria and the excellent benefits package (includ - ing language and cultural training, living and housing expenses in the field, medical and dental coverage, deferment of student-loan repayment, transportation allowance to and from one's service assignment, vacation time and allowances, finan - cial readjustment and allowance, and employment assistance postservice), contact the Peace Corps at 800/424-8580, ext.1843; or Office of University Programs at <www.peacecorps.gov>. After acceptance into the program, the student completes the course work on the Loma Linda campus.

CULminating a Ctivity The School of Public Health requires each gradu - ate to complete a synthesizing activity that dem - onstrates basic competencies in the five core areas of public health. residen Cies for Physi Cians Residency training in the specialties of general preventive medicine and public health and in occupational medicine, as well as a combined residency in family and preventive medicine, are offered by the School of Public Health for quali - fied physicians. Both the residency training and the combined residency programs are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medi - cal Education (ACGME) and prepare residents for certification by the American Board of Preventive Medicine (ABPM). Both specialties require the suc - cessful completion of an accredited M.P .H. degree. Because Loma Linda University Medical Center offers an annual tuition benefit to all employees, approximately 40 quarter hours of the required 56-60 hours to complete an M.P .H. degree will be at a nominal cost. Applicants who have completed an accredited internship year but not an M.P .H. degree need to apply for the two-year integrated academic and practicum program; while those who have completed an accredited internship year and an M.P .H. degree need to inquire regarding applica - tion for the practicum year only. Those interested in applying to either of these training programs should contact the residency office in Nichol Hall, Room 1516 by either calling 909/558-4918 or emailing ifoster@llu.edu. Preventive medicine residency The three-year program consists of an internship year followed by two years of integrated academic and practicum experiences. Three internship posi - tions are offered through the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP) each year. The program combines the academic and practi - cum experience over two years. During this time, residents will complete their M.P .H. degree and rotate at the community training sites. Residents are encouraged to major in epidemiology, health administration, or health care practice, but are not required to do so. Practice sites include the Center for Health Promotion, the Jerry L. Pettis V A Medical Center, Patton State Hospital, Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Fontana, San Ber - nardino County Department of Public Health, and the Inland Empire Health Plan. A wide variety of intervention programs to reduce health risks and promote healthful living practices are integrated into the second- and third-year rotations; and an international health emphasis is available for interested residents, including involvement with international projects in developing countries. Under the guidance of the residency and faculty members at the School of Public Health, each resident conducts a research project on a topic of choice during the senior year. family and preventive medicine residency The Family and Preventive Medicine Residency Program combines curricular elements of a three-year family medicine residency and a three-year preventive medicine residency into an efficient training program of four years. During the first year, residents complete a family medicine intern - ship but also set aside time to begin course work towards their Master of Public Health (M.P .H.) degree. The second year remains family medicine 462 UNIVERSITY CATALOG centered but also includes a preventive medicine rotation and further M.P .H. course work. During the third and fourth years, there is an equal mix of family and preventive medicine rotations and M.P .H. degree course work, as well as elective time. Residents may select one of two tracks: (a) global health or (b) lifestyle medicine. In each track, resi - dents are exposed to new models of clinical care and also spend extra time emphasizing natural, nonpharmaceutical approaches to health and heal - ing. Elective time during the third and fourth years can be used to pursue one of the specific tracks summarized above or for additional learning in other areas of interest and value to the resident. occupational medicine residency Physicians who have completed an internship (PGY-1) year are eligible to apply for the two-year occupational medicine program, which involves an integrated academic and practicum phase. Most residents select an M.P .H. degree major in environmental health. If an accepted applicant has already completed an accredited degree with a major emphasis in an area other than environ - mental health, s/he will be required to take the following courses during the training: ENVH 589 Environmental Risk Assessment, ENVH 581 Principles of Industrial Hygiene, and ENVH 587 Environmental Toxicology. The program emphasizes the clinical and ap - plied aspects of occupational and environmental medicine. It focuses on the health of individuals and groups in relationship to work, hazards in the workplace, and environmental issues. The Uni - versity takes special interest in the assessment of individual health hazards and the identification and promotion of practices that help to reduce risk and prevent or postpone disease and injury. Under the guidance of the residency and faculty members of the School of Public Health, each resident completes a research project on a topic of choice during the senior year.addiction-medicine fellowship The fellowship program provides addiction- medicine experience and opportunities, and utilizes a wide range of evaluation and treatment settings. Fellows will be involved with treatment and education groups, lectures, and teaching of internal medicine residents, family practice resi - dents, preventive medicine residents, and medical students. Applicants must have successfully completed an accredited residency-training program in any medical specialty and have a valid medical license in the state of California. Fellows rotate at the following sites: Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center, Betty Ford Center, and Kaiser-Fontana Chemical Dependency Recovery Program. The start date for a one-year fellowship is July 1 of each year, though this is negotiable. mediCaL/denta L Leadershi P Program The rising complexity of health care in this coun - try and abroad will require increasingly skilled leadership in both the public and private sectors\u2014from sophisticated health care systems to mission hospitals, from research laboratories to primary care. Combining a Master of Public Health degree in an appropriate discipline with an M.D. or D.D.S. degree can provide a sound foundation for young professionals seeking to influence and manage the future. The School of Public Health offers combined- degrees programs\u2014M.D./M.P .H. and D.D.S./M.P .H.\u2014for students enrolled in Loma Linda University Schools of Medicine or Dentistry. The didactic course work for the Master of Public Health degree can be taken in any major within a twelve-month period after either the second or third year of the M.D. or D.D.S. program. In some cases, additional time may be required for field work. Each student is expected to concentrate full time on the Master of Public Health degree during the designated year. Applications will be reviewed competitively, with particular focus on potential for future health care leadership. Academic Policies and General Regulations 463 distan Ce Learning Programs The School of Public Health offers master's degree programs in various majors online and at off-campus sites to meet the needs of qualified in - dividuals who seek to develop graduate-level com - petencies in public health but who for a variety of reasons choose not to be full-time, on-campus students. The School of Public Health has had much experience in offering distance learning master's degree programs. For more than thirty years, the School of Public Health has adapted its program delivery style to meet the needs of busy profes - sionals. Currently the School of Public Health's Online Executive Master of Public Health in public health practice and the Online Master of Public Health in health education programs caters to both American and international students. The school has offered M.P .H. degree programs in Russia, Chile and Peru; and an M.B.A. degree program in Guam and Hawaii. The off-campus programs require the school's faculty to travel to the education site and teach courses in the condensed format.

SAMUEL SORET, Program Director The Department of Environmental and Occu - pational Health builds upon students' academic foundation in the sciences to prepare them to meet the growing employment market for environmen - tal health specialists, industrial hygienists, geo - graphic information system specialists, and other professions that examine human-environment interactions. The M.P .H. degree in environmental and occu - pational health is designed for individuals with professional practitioner career objectives in the area of environmental and occupational health. Students who complete this academic program will acquire the professional and scientific skills to perform as environmental quality control profes - sionals in local, state, or federal government health departments/ agencies; and in private business/industry. The program has been approved by the State of California Environmental Health Special - ist Registration Committee, 601 North 7th Street, MS 396, P .O. Box 942732, Sacramento, CA 94234-7320. Satisfactory completion of this curriculum meets, in part, the eligibility requirements to sit for the Registered Environmental Health Special - ist (REHS) Examination administered by the Cali - fornia Department of Public Health. Satisfactory performance on the examination qualifies indi - viduals for practice as registered environmental health specialists in California and, by reciprocity, in the forty-nine remaining states. Admission into the M.P .H degree program is considered for individuals who can provide verification of at least two years of applicable environmental health experience (with preference given to applicants who are registered environ - mental health specialists); or for students without previous professional experience but with a solid science background.Learner outcomes Upon completion of the degree, the graduate should be able to: 1. Describe the health effects of major environ - mental and occupational agents. 2. Apply the principles of risk assessment to determine the impact of environmental and occupational hazards on human health. 3. Recommend appropriate policy and in - terventions, such as engineering controls, behavior change, or material substitution necessary for reducing human exposures to environmental and occupational hazards. 4. Interpret federal and state regulations and participate in the development of policies that will influence overall environmental and occupational health outcomes. 5. Communicate effectively the synergistic rela - tionship between environmental and public health issues to a variety of audiences. 6. Conduct sampling programs and interpret environmental analytical data. 7. Demonstrate basic familiarity with geospa - tial information systems technologies and methods in support of environmental health practice. indicators of educational effectiveness Performance-based outcomes are obtained through course written and oral examinations, papers, oral presentations, a department compre - hensive examination, a culminating activity, and a field internship. In addition, students must take an integrated capstone public health course. Track-specific performance indicators are listed below under each track. Qualified candidates also take the California Registered Environmental Health Specialist (REHS) Examination. degree requirements Prere QUisite The following prerequisite courses must be com - pleted prior to enrolling in the registered envi - Environmental and Occupational Health\u2014PH 479 ronmental health specialist programs in environ - mental health: biological science with laboratory (one year) general chemistry with laboratory (one year) general physics with laboratory (one year) organic chemistry with laboratory (minimum of two-quarter sequence) general microbiology with laboratory (one course) calculus or college algebra (one course). Core QUisite The department will consider for acceptance into the program committed students lacking some prerequisites but who otherwise possess a strong academic background and exhibit a solid scho - lastic performance. Upon acceptance, the missing prerequisite courses are to be taken concurrently during the first two quarters of the program, in addition to the units required for the degree. Culminating activity A formal, oral presentation and a written paper on a topic of current environmental health im - portance are required as a culminating activity. Student presentations and paper are evaluated on professionalism, scientific merit, and thorough - ness. The culminating activity shall include a comprehensive examination (prior to the field experience), field experience (upon completion of essential major course work), professional portfo - lio (upon completion of the field experience), full written report of project (not later that one month after successful oral presentation), and an exit in - terview with the department chair (at the conclu - sion of the program). Concentrations environmenta L heaLth and geoinformati Cs A concentration in environmental health and geoinformatics can be pursued by individuals who desire to integrate training in modern geo - technologies and related methods into their envi - ronmental health studies. Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) skills are highly desired today as an integral part of the informatics competencies that are required of public health professionals as out - lined in the 2002 Institute of Medicine Report and in the CDC's National Agenda for Public Health Informatics. Acquiring dual skills in public health and geoinformatics enhances the preparation of environmental health professionals by expanding their decision-making and problem-solving abil - ity. The department is a national leader in health geoinformatics, and it possesses a world-class GIS laboratory where students can access state-of-the-art geotechnological tools and a multitude of geospatial databases. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the Health Geoinformatics Summer Institute offered from June to September to conveniently complete some or all required GIS courses in an intensive format. Prerequisite Students must have completed the program pre - requisite courses prior to enrolling, as listed under the Environmental and Occupational Health Program. In addition, students in the environmen - tal health and geoinformatics concentration must demonstrate computer proficiency, although no previous experience with GIS technology is re - quired. Advanced placement can be considered for students with previous GIS experience or training. Each student must work on a field experience in which geospatial technology and methods are applied to a problem or issue in environmental health. Culminating activity A formal, oral presentation and a written paper on a topic linking and spanning across the fields of environmental health and geoinformatics are required as a culminating activity. Student pre - sentations and paper are evaluated on profession - alism, scientific merit, and thoroughness. The cul - minating activity shall include a comprehensive examination prior to field experience; field experi - ence, upon completion of essential major course work; professional portfolio, upon completion of field experience; full written report of project not later that one month after successful oral presenta - tion; and an exit interview with the department chair at the conclusion of the program.480 UNIVERSITY CATALOG PUbLiC hea Lth C ore mPh mPh With gis ENVH 586 Environmental Health Administration 3.0 3.0 EPDM 509 Principles of Epidemiology I 3.0 3.0 GLBH 524 Cultural Competence and Health Disparities 2.0 2.0 HPRO 509 Principles of Health Behavior 3.0 3.0 HPRO 536 Program Planning and Evaluation 2.0 2.0 NUTR 509 Public Health Nutrition and Biology 3.0 3.0 PHCJ 605 Overview of Public Health 1.0 1.0 PHCJ 675 Integrated Public Health Capstone 2.0 2.0 RELE 534 Ethical Issues in Public Health 3.0 3.0 STAT 509 General Statistics 4.0 4.0 Totals 26.0 26.0 maJor mPh mPh With gis ENVH 515 Food Quality Assurance Not required for experienced Environmental Health Professionals 3.0 3.0 ENVH 524 GIS Software Applications and Methods 3.0 3.0 ENVH 539 GIS Applications in Environmental Health 2.0 2.0 ENVH 567 Hazardous Materials and Solid-waste Management 3.0 3.0 ENVH 568 Water Quality Assurance 3.0 3.0 ENVH 569 Environmental Sampling and Analysis Not required for experienced Environmental Health Professionals4.0 4.0 ENVH 581 Principles of Industrial Hygiene 3.0 3.0 ENVH 587 Environmental Toxicology 3.0 3.0 ENVH 589 Environmental Risk Assessment 3.0 3.0 ENVH 605 Seminar in Environmental and Occupational Health1.0 1.0 ENVH 566 Outdoor Air Quality and Human Health (3.0) Choose one course 3.0 3.0 ENVH 575 Indoor Air Quality (3.0) Totals 24.0-31.0 31.0 geoinformati Cs mPh mPh With gis ENVH 521 Cartography and Map Design 2.0 ENVH 522 Principles of Geographic Information Systems and Science 3.0 ENVH 526 Seminar in Geographic Information Systems 1.0 ENVH 535 Integration of Geospatial Data in GIS 2.0 ENVH 536 Spatial Analytic Techniques and GIS 3.0 Totals \u2014 11.0 Epidemiology\u2014PH 481 eLeCtives mPh mPh With gis ____ ___ Elective Experienced Environmental Health professionals required to take 9 units2.0-9.0 Totals 2.0-9.0 \u2014 fieLd ex Perien Ce Practicum units are in addition to the minimum graduate units required for the degree. mPh mPh With gis ENVH 798B Field Practicum 12.0 12.0 Totals \u2014 \u2014 overall t otals 59 .0 68 .0 other requirements In addition to the foregoing degree requirements, the student must also complete the following: Com Prehensive examination Students must satisfactorily complete a de -partmental comprehensive examination prior to graduation.

JOB, Program Director Program description The Department of Global Health (GLBH) prepares committed professionals who are both technically competent and cross-culturally skilled in creating and facilitating sustainable health and development programs in diverse settings and populations. Utilizing an experiential, evidence-based model of learning, this program enables graduates to contribute to a better quality of life for all people\u2014especially those who are vulner - able, underserved, marginalized, and disadvan - taged. The department's extensive network of Global Health\u2014PH 495 global and local resources affords a broad spec - trum of options for students to learn and practice the \"art and science\" of this exciting discipline. The M.P .H. degree in global health prepares career professionals who qualify for entry-level positions in nongovernmental organizations; faith-based and other voluntary agencies; com - munity-based organizations; county, state, and national health departments; private foundations; public health practice organizations; and in the nonprofit, relief-and-development sector. Gradu - ates also find positions in government and trans - national organizations, such as the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and in nation - al assistance organizations like the United States Agency for International Development. Further academic training is also an option for graduates interested in teaching and research. Graduates with field experience (including students who add the global health M.P .H. degree to a previous clini - cal or academic degree) will qualify for manageri - al positions in program planning and evaluation, contracting, technical assistance, grant writing, and advocacy. Learner outcomes Utilizing an experiential approach, the com - petency-based curriculum is built around three themes: 1. Developing and maintaining a sustainable healthy environment; 2. Supporting and empowering communities, families, and individuals; and 3. Advocating for vulnerable populations. By the end of the program, graduates are expect - ed to demonstrate competency in: 1. Assessing capacity, systems, services, needs, and resources. 2. Planning comprehensive, integrated inter - ventions. 3. Planning, implementing, maintaining, and evaluating community-based programs. 4. Promoting collaborations among sectors, disciplines, countries, and regions.5. Advocating for social justice, equity, and ac - cess to health and other services that contrib - ute to individual and community well-being. 6. Contributing to operational and translational research. educational effectiveness Educational effectiveness will be determined through reading assignments and reports, re - search papers, oral presentations, group work on proposals, community engagement projects and research, laboratory exercises, case studies, tests, quizzes, field practicum, and exit interview. Corequisites (may be taken concurrently during the first two quarters of program, in addition to units required for the degree) Anatomy and physiologyMicrobiology Units required The total minimum units required is 56 (includ - ing culminating experience), as well as the field practicum units (variable). Ten public health semi - nars are required. global epidemiology concentration PRAMIL N. SINGH, Director Program des CriPtion In schools of public health, a traditional domain of the M.P .H. degree in epidemiology has been the training in population-based survey research. Three recent trends in population health are note - worthy: 1) the emergence of multinational survey research teams working in the environments of academia (i.e., Fogarty/NIH model of universities in high-income and low-income regions collabo - rating), nongovernmental organizations, and policy institutes; 2) the emergence of a chronic disease epidemic in developing regions in which public health in such nations as India and China is facing the challenge of obesity co-existing with 496 UNIVERSITY CATALOG malnutrition; and 3) the need for valid survey data from large samples for immediate use in program planning and health policy relative to exposure and disease. In light of these global trends, the global epi - demiology M.P .H. degree student will complete the same formal training in epidemiologic re - search methods as other epidemiology majors, but will integrate this training with the global health knowledge base, specific global health skills (qualitative research methods, alternative sampling strategies, alternative survey design approaches, and spatial data analysis), and global health worldview. The training will enable gradu - ates to plan, design, and implement surveys of hard-to-access, vulnerable populations in global and community-based settings. After the first year of intensive course work on the core knowledge and skills of global health and epidemiology, the global epidemiology major will be engaged in a summer of integrated community development, research, and field practicum activities in commu - nity and/or global settings. This concentration is designed to educate global health professionals who will be capable of: 1. Planning, designing, and implementing epidemiologic studies that serve research and program planning needs in global and community settings. 2. Planning, designing, and implementing a \"mixed methods\" (quantitative and qualita - tive components) study that serves research and program planning needs in global and community settings. 3. Analyzing and interpreting data from a wide range of methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, GIS) to serve research, program planning, and health policy initiatives in global and community settings. 4. Incorporating the knowledge base (i.e., primary health care, health disparities, millennium development goals, culture/behavior-social context of health, child health and survival, public health systems and government, micro-enterprise/poverty alleviation/social economics, complex health emergencies and preparedness, nutrition and food security, health education, injury/violence prevention and control), skills, and world iew of global health training into their planning, design, and implementation of epidemiologic studies. 5. Writing grant proposals to fund global epidemiology and global health research and programs. edUCationa L effe Ctiveness Educational effectiveness will be determined through reading assignments and reports, re - search papers, oral presentations, group work on proposals, community engagement projects and research, laboratory exercises, case studies, tests, quizzes, field practicum, and exit interview. Core QUisite (may be taken concurrently during the first two quarters of program, in addition to units required for the degree) Anatomy and physiologyMicrobiologyCollege algebra (calculus preferred) fieLd PraCtiCUm gLbh 699/ a pplied r esearch and field Practicum Students will complete a major field practicum component in a global community setting that partners them with an organization outside the University (governmental, nongovernmental, community-based partnership, humanitarian as - sistance). This experience will provide students an opportunity to actively participate in and observe the organization's practice of global health and epidemiology. This comprehensive, 4-unit research-based project typically requires a two-to-three month continuous engagement in a global community setting. The on-site research objectives will be met by students completing an epidemiology research project in the global community setting under the mentorship of faculty from global health and epidemiology. The preferred scenario is that the Global Health\u2014PH 497 student is working on a faculty member's project in the global community setting. global maternal and child health concentration RONALD H. MATAYA, Director desCriPtion In its comprehensive definition, the term mater - nal and child health (MCH), a major subfield of public health, encompasses women, infants, chil - dren of all ages, adolescents, and families (Asso - ciation of Teachers in Maternal and Child Health 2001). Therefore, the goal of MCH programs is to improve the health of women, children, adoles - cents, and families. Against the backdrop of the Healthy People 2010 document, which highlights the importance of their health, this goal emerges out of a clear recognition that women and chil - dren are the most vulnerable, least powerful and often neglected members of societies around the world; that women and children form a major seg - ment of the population, particularly in developing countries; that the health of mothers and children is closely interrelated; that a significant part of MCH morbidity, disability, and mortality stems from preventable causes; and that women, infants, children of all ages, adolescemts, and families deserve special services in order to assure their future health and development and that of the communities in which they live. Building on its strong foundation of knowledge, skills, and worldview of community health and development, the Global Health Department will incorporate the recommended competen - cies throughout the two-year MCH curriculum. The program will utilize family and community-centered interdisciplinary approaches with special emphases on cultural competency and empower - ment. Graduates of this program will be able to effectively apply their MCH skills and knowledge both in the developed and developing world context. This concentration is designed to educate global public health professionals who will be capable of: 1. Planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating maternal and child health programs nationally and globally. 2. Understanding, promoting, developing, and applying national and international health policies and programs that impact maternal and child health issues. 3. Advocating for public health policies and programs to improve maternal and child health. 4. Writing grant proposals to fund maternal and child health programs locally and inter - nationally 5. Preparing behavioral change communica - tions materials in maternal and child health. 6. Conducting research on maternal and child health edUCationa L effe Ctiveness Educational effectiveness will be determined through reading assignments and reports, re - search papers, oral presentations, group work on proposals, community engagement projects and research, laboratory exercises, case studies, tests, quizzes, field practicum, and exit interview.

DAVID S. PENNER, Program Director general description The current, rapidly changing leadership arena demands a diversity of leadership talents to Health Policy and Leadership\u2014PH 515 respond to the varied challenges posed by the global community. Moreover, creative approaches are needed to meet these challenges. The Doctor of Public Health in health policy and management degree program of Loma Linda University is a unique and wonderful opportunity to serve at the very heart of leadership development. The primary focus of this program is to enhance the skills and abilities of those in positions of leadership; to add to the body of knowledge about leadership through observation, reflection, and research; and to bring together leaders who desire to learn, mentor, and model good leadership. This program, in part, meets the great need for leaders of integrity and understanding in both research and practice. Leadership talents cannot be taught, but they can be developed and strengthened. The design of the program is to help individuals discover their talents and strengths, imagine how they can be developed, and then devise plans to increase and extend their skills and knowledge around those unique strengths. description of the curriculum components orientation Prior to admission to the doctoral program, each participant completes the orientation for leader - ship (12 credits). Composed of three courses, this orientation includes time for assessing individual leadership strengths and academic potential, un - derstanding personal leadership styles and skills, exploring areas of future leadership development, and preparing academic plans. Admission to the orientation is limited to thirty per cohort. Admis - sion to the degree is limited to nine-to-twelve individuals per cohort. Admission to the orienta - tion for leadership is not admission to the doctoral degree program. aCademi C PL an During the orientation for leadership, each participant creates an individualized academic plan. This plan outlines the specific details for the participant's degree program. It includes elements such as a statement of goals, a record of past experience, the result of various leadership tests and assessments, a personal statement of vision of achievement by the end of the program (and beyond), and a specific plan of how the participant will demonstrate the eight areas of leadership competency. For each of the areas of competency, the participant indicates how that particular com - petency is to be achieved\u2014listing specific courses, strategic experiences, directed research, past experience, and/or other evidence to be presented as part of his portfolio. A request is also submitted at this time for academic advisors and research supervisors. The completed academic plan is presented as part of the application for admission to the doctoral program and must be approved by the program faculty before the participant is admitted to the doctoral program. Changes in the academic plan may be made during the program with approval of the program faculty. Portfo Lio Achievement of competency is found in the evidence contained in the portfolio, not in at - tendance records or simply the completion of required course work. Based on the academic plan approved at the time of admission to the doctoral program, the participant assembles the portfolio throughout the program. The completed portfolio is presented at the end of the program as evidence that all areas of competency have been met and the requirements of the program satisfied. aCademi C CoUrses Depending on specific needs outlined in the academic plan, participants choose from a variety of courses and mentored activities. Courses are available in traditional classroom settings, online, or through directed study and mentored activities. resear Ch ProJeCts Throughout their program of study, participants are involved in research at various levels. They may be part of an ongoing research projects at the University or elsewhere. The doctoral dissertation is an integrated part of the degree.516 UNIVERSITY CATALOG sUPP ort Given the nature of the program and the disci - pline, interaction with many other persons is para - mount. Leadership cannot be studied in isolation; collaboration is encouraged and modeled through - out the program. Since support and advisement is so critical, special emphasis is placed on academic support. Three examples follow. Faculty advisors and professional mentors. All participants have a primary academic advisor assigned from the core health policy and leader - ship faculty. In addition, participants may choose additional mentor(s) from beyond the department or University. These mentors provide support and encouragement, as well as depth and expertise. Learning and study support groups. There are at least two specifically designed study groups. One group of fellow participants (three-to-five) serves as a creative force and idea exchange. The group meets on a regular basis to keep members of the group focused on completing the degree. Another group, created by each participant and formed of individuals primarily outside the program (five-to-eight) creates an extended learning environ - ment and helps to create/provide opportunities in which the participants can improve and dem - onstrate their leadership skills. These learning groups include mentors, work colleagues, profes - sional associates, and friends. Although not tech - nically part of the health policy and leadership faculty, these groups nonetheless become exten - sions of the ethos and mission of the program. Yearly conferences. As professionals, all partici - pants attend an annual health policy and lead - ership conference until the completion of their programs and may continue to do so afterward. These open conferences provide students opportu - nities to discuss current health policy and leader - ship issues, present scholarly papers, consult with academic advisors, report on their progress in the program, and meet with fellow participants for collaborative and networking activities. The first three conferences are taken for academic credit. Learning outcomes In addition to the eight University learning out - comes, the Health Policy and Leadership Program has chosen five additional learning outcomes. 1. Leadership: Participants understand a broad range of leadership issues and participate in future-oriented planning and change processes. 2. Health policy: Participants understand that health policy is a multidisciplinary field of inquiry and practice concerned with the de - livery, quality, and costs of health and health care for individuals and populations. 3. Ethics: Participants demonstrate ethical choices, values, and professional practices implicit in their discipline and personal eth - ics. 4. Reflection: Participants model reflective lead - ership. 5. Scholarship: Participants develop skills in reading, evaluating, conducting, and report - ing research. areas of leadership competency and underlying themes In order to more clearly define the range of meaning and expectations for this program, eight areas of leadership competency and two underly - ing themes have been identified and elaborated. These form the framework in which the academic plan is developed and the portfolio evaluated. 1. Policy development and strategy: Participants understand the framework for policy devel - opment and explain how strategy is essential to achieving outcomes. 2. Systems thinking: Participants explore the dy - namic interactions among human and social systems and seek to improve the interrelated and interdependent relationships among individuals, groups, organizations, and com - munities. 3. Community building: Participants, in Peter Block's words, \"create hospitable space, in - vite collective attention to what is important and make the group's intelligence visible to itself\" . 4. Understanding diversity: Participants utilize leadership skills in bringing together a vari - ety of persons, including those who are dif - Health Policy and Leadership\u2014PH 517 ferent from themselves (age, gender, religion, work ethics, mind styles, etc.) in a way that strengthens organizations/ communities. 5. Leading change: In creating a supportive envi - ronment for the change, participants encour - age creativity and innovation and help bring about both individual and organizational change. 6. Effective communication: Participants accept responsibility for and respond to finding appropriate avenues to communicate with a variety of audiences. 7. Conflict resolution: Participants, through care - ful deliberation, good listening and under - standing, interest-based negotiation, and mutually beneficial collaboration, practice the fragile process of addressing conflict. 8. Management and governance: Participants observe, participate in, evaluate the various styles of management and governance, and explore management strategies and gover - nance structures for the future. integrated themes Woven throughout the eight areas of competen - cy, two themes elevate the developmental process and increase the value of the discussion within each area. While the areas of leadership competen - cy are broadly found in many similar programs, the emphasis on ethics and scholarship makes this program particularly valuable to those seeking to model leadership characterized by integrity and understanding. 1. Ethics\u2014Virtue and obligation: Participants demonstrate ethical choices, values, and pro - fessional practices implicit in their discipline and personal ethics. 2. Scholarship\u2014Research and reflection: Par - ticipants practice reflective leadership and develop skills in reading, evaluating, con - ducting, and reporting research. educational effectiveness initia L assessment The orientation for leadership begins with intense evaluation and feedback as participants discover and evaluate their talents, skills, and strengths. Each participant works closely with a program advisor to prepare an academic plan. This plan is evaluated at the end of the orientation and must be approved by the program faculty before admission to the program. annUaL Progress re Ports and Portfo Lio revie Ws Yearly progress reports and portfolio reviews are scheduled at the time of the annual conferences. The program advisor and other program faculty (two or three) meet with the participant to review the progress of the portfolio, consider any changes and/or additions to the academic plan, answer questions, and give advice as necessary. These yearly evaluations should not be seen as isolated conversations but more as markers along the way in an ongoing dialogue with the program faculty. If unsatisfactory progress is being made, a letter of warning is given following the review. Failure to achieve satisfactory progress will result in the termination of the participant or in a hold being placed on his/her registration until the neces - sary progress is made. In all cases, a summary of the review will be included in the participant's portfolio. faCUL ty invo Lvement in Learning gro UPs The academic advisor meets regularly with the participant's mentors and support group to evaluate portfolio progress and opportunities to enhance the learning experience. The frequency of these meetings will vary, depending on the specific activities related to the demonstration of competency. It is anticipated that much of this will be done in the first three-or-four years of the degree. Notes on these meetings will be included in the participant's portfolio. Progress thro Ugh dissertation Involvement in research and reflection is encour - aged throughout the program. Already included in the academic plan is an outline of such activi -518 UNIVERSITY CATALOG ties to be completed during the degree program. It is anticipated that the academic advisor and participant will discuss the progress of topic development and formulation of dissertation pro - posal even within the first year. Research courses taken early in the program will also provide feedback on satisfactory progression in this area. Building on the existing School of Public Health's Dr.P .H. Handbook, a clear set of guidelines will be further developed to apprise both the advisor and the participant of the steps required in taking the dissertation from topic to proposal, approval, research, writing, and defense. The dissertation committee will oversee the progress of the disser - tation to the point of satisfactory defense.admissions requirements (in addition to the University admissions requirements) 1.

Culminating experience Besides the dissertation defense, which is itself a major culminating experience, participants will present their portfolios at the end of the program. The portfolios are based on the academic plan and the eight areas of leadership competency, sup - ported by evidence and validated as sections are completed, and assessed at the end of the program field practicum Throughout the program, there is an intentional integration of the subject being examined and the practice of it. As a result, many courses contain a significant component of field application. Some courses consist of field practicum. But more im - portantly, the program is designed around \"taking learning to the workplace.\" As such, participants are expected to develop a learning environment at their place of work. The work in these learn - ing groups will be evaluated by the local work 520 UNIVERSITY CATALOG as the participants present them in the culminat - ing degree activity. research Throughout their program of study, participants are involved in research at various levels. They may be part of an ongoing research project at the University or elsewhere. The doctoral disserta - tion is an integrated part of the degree from the beginning of the degree program. Leadership faculty maintains a research agenda and invites participants to join them in ongoing projects. It is anticipated that the research conducted by the program participants will coincide with the re - search interests of one or more faculty. To support and encourage research, the program includes a faculty member whose task is to coordinate the research efforts of those enrolled in the program. Underscoring the importance of research, one of the underlying themes supporting the leadership competencies is scholarship. As such, participants will practice reflective leadership; develop skills in reading, evaluating, conducting, and reporting research; develop a habit for and practice in reflec - tive thinking and critical self-evaluation in all ar - eas of competency; analyze and evaluate research published in professional journals in both qualita -tive and quantitative traditions in four or more areas of competency; present posters, professional papers and/or research findings at one or more professional conferences in two or more areas of competency; demonstrate the ability to conduct independent research at an advanced level, from problem definition to research and oral defense, in at least one research tradition while addressing issues in one or more areas of competency; and participate in the dialogue of the discipline by submitting at least two articles for publication. individuals who may benefit from the program Given the context of Loma Linda University, participants will be drawn primarily from public health; but they will also be drawn from health care, higher education, NGOs, and faith-based CBOs that have developed health initiatives, and other related groups. Two important require - ments are that those admitted to the program will have had sufficient experience in the workplace (normally five years or more) and that they are currently employed in an organization that is supportive of their degree program and unique requirements to develop a \"learning environ - ment\" at the workplace. Lifestyle Medicine\u2014PH (m .h .) SERENA TONSTAD, Program Director Lifesty Le mediCine\u2014 m .P .h . Program formats Course work for the Lifestyle Medicine Program may be pursued as a 60-unit predominantly on-campus program of which 6 units are offered on - line. Almost one-half of the total course work (up to 30 units) may optionally be completed online, with the remainder completed on campus (30 or more units). In the Lifestyle Medicine Program, health professionals with relevant clinical licenses are empowered to provide lifestyle change interven - tions and promote healthy behaviors for patients with chronic diseases or patients at-risk of chronic diseases, while understanding the population determinants of wellness, health, and disease. The curriculum emphasizes interventions based on scientific data and established behavioral and learning theories that promote individual and public health through the processes of education, health behavior change, and health promotion. It emphasizes that health professionals who are not physicians are not enabled to practice medicine when awarded this degree. Lifestyle Medicine\u2014PH 521 The curriculum focuses on teaching public health practice classes that are needed to possess core skills in public health, in evaluating the scien - tific literature, and in understanding and applying the science of disease prevention in the context of mind-body interaction. More practice-oriented classes teach the scientific basis and applications of exercise prescriptions, nutrition counseling, tobacco cessation and health behavior change techniques. Graduates may use their skills acquired in the program to enhance their already acquired clini - cal knowledge and skills in medicine, nursing, clinical psychology, osteopathy, pharmacy, or other health professions. They are academically prepared to apply preventive methodologies to chronic diseases and risk factors; conduct individ - ual health assessments; provide medical lifestyle counseling; properly evaluate and apply lifestyle medicine-related research findings, and lead and evaluate health promotion projects. Students who hold a clinical health professional degree may apply to the program. Learner outcomes Graduates of the program in lifestyle medicine will: Possess a core field of knowledge of public health, with emphasis on the application of preventive methodologies to chronic dis - eases. Accurately assess lifestyle-related risk factors for chronic diseases. Provide appropriate interventions in regard to these risk factors, e.g., medical behavioral counseling in exercise, nutrition, and tobacco dependence. Evaluate and properly apply lifestyle medi - cine-related research findings.

In the U.S.A., more than 400,000 individuals (30 percent of cancer mortality) die from tobacco-related causes every year. Although a variety of strategies are being used to address the tobacco use problem, there is a dearth of academic-based programs to educate health professionals who will function as effec - tive practitioners and researchers in tobacco-use prevention and treatment. The program is offered as a combination of online courses, on-campus courses, and a men - tored research project. The online course work on tobacco control epidemiology, prevention and treatment is made possible through a grant from the Association of Schools of Public Health and the American Legacy Foundation. Learner o UtComes Upon completion of this certificate program, participants should: 1. Design a survey with population-based vari - ables pertinent to tobacco policy that mea - sures prevalence of tobacco use, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco use, and health behaviors associated with tobacco use. 2. Conduct qualitative studies with population-based variables pertinent to tobacco policy that assess tobacco use; knowledge and at - titudes about tobacco use, and health behav - iors associated with tobacco use. 3. Design research programs to establish a na - tional and regional baseline and subsequent compliance with conditions set forth by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Con - trol Treaty (WHO) and NPOWER initiative (WHO). 4.

The School of Religion has three degree programs that associate areas in the scienc - es with religion. But the major task of the School of Religion remains enriching programs in the other seven schools of the University with a faith-based, wholistic approach to the health sciences. So, in whatever program you have enrolled, you will come in contact with School of Religion offer - ings that have been uniquely designed to help you prepare for wholistic ministry within your chosen profession. Studying at Loma Linda University is about more than just careers and professions; it is about mission and purpose for all of life. The School of Religion is pleased to have an important role in helping to prepare you for the most fulfill - ing life and career possible. Detailed information about our three master's degrees in religion is contained in this section of the Catalog. These programs have been designed to specifically equip graduates with skills in clinical ministry, bioethics, and religion and the sciences. However, within the framework of our academic programs, we also offer a unique op - portunity for LLU students in other professional programs to apply for dual enrollment in either bioethics or clinical ministry. Students enrolled in Dentistry (D.D.S.), marital and family therapy (M.S.), medicine (M.D.), nursing (M.S.), psychol - ogy (Psy.D. or Ph.D.), and social policy and social research are eligible to apply for admission to the master's degree in either the Bioethics or Clinical Ministry program. Please refer to The Combined Degrees Programs of the University section to learn more about our dual enrollment degree programs. On behalf of the faculty and staff of the School of Religion, let me personally invite you to seriously consider the courses and the programs that we offer. We can help strengthen your faith; broaden your spiritual and academic horizons; enhance your ability to serve; and prepare you not only for this life, but also for eternity. May God enrich your studies, Jon Paulien, Ph.D. Dean, School of Religion 552 UNIVERSITY CATALOG School Foundations history In the configuration of Loma Linda University as a health sciences university, the role of religion as integrative in each of the programs of the Univer - sity is mandated and continuously affirmed by the University administration and the Board of Trustees. In July of 1990, the Faculty of Religion (now the School of Religion) was established to assist in this integration. PhiLoso Phy As implied by its motto, \"To make man whole,\" the University affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional ex - pertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. mission s tatement The School of Religion is committed to the fol - lowing four tasks, as informed by the teachings and practice of the Seventh-day Adventist heritage and mission: 1. To promote Christian wholeness for faculty and students in their personal and profes - sional lives and witness. 2. To provide a religion curriculum with the following emphases: Theological studies (biblical, historical, doctrinal, mission, and philosophical). Ethical studies. Relational studies (applied theology, clinical ministry, and psychology of religion).3. To foster and support research in theological, ethical, and relational disciplines. 4. To serve the University, the church, and the larger world community by personal in - volvement in fostering deeper spirituality, theological integrity, and social justice. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for in - forming themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matricula - tion, and graduation.

Scholars in the natural sciences, the human sci - ences, and numerous applied sciences recognize the importance of examining religion from their particular perspectives. And religion scholars ap - preciate the importance of the questions that the methods and conclusions of the sciences raise for religious belief and practice. As a Seventh-day Adventist health sciences university, Loma Linda University rests on the conviction that there is a positive relation between religion and the sciences. Its commitment to a variety of health professional programs reflects the belief that the natural world is God's good cre - ation, and that human beings are inherently part of the physical order of things. Its commitment to higher education, including various avenues of graduate study, expresses the belief that all truth is God's truth; and that the acquisition of truth calls for the diligent application of all our powers. These convictions support the attempt to bring scientific knowledge within the overarching per - spective of Christian faith. The Master of Arts degree Religion and the Sci - ences Program is designed for several types of students: those who want a degree in religion and science before pursuing further graduate work in one or the other of these areas; graduate students in the natural and social sciences who would like to combine their other academic interests with a serious study of religion; students in professional programs who also have an interest in the area of religion and science; and individuals who wish to explore the interface of religion and the sciences within the context of serious academic work. The Religion and the Sciences Program is ad - ministered by the School of Religion. It draws on resources from various sectors of the campus, including the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences faculty of the School of Science and Tech - nology; the Department of Psychology faculty of the School of Science and Technology; and other faculties in the University, as well as other schol - ars and professors with expertise in the area. Upon completion of the Religion and the Sci - ences Program, students will demonstrate: 1. A knowledge of the research methods of religious studies and at least one branch of the natural and human sciences. 2. An understanding of the contrasting and complementary aspects of scientific inquiry and religion experience. 3. The ability to bring into critical conversation the theoretical foundations of science and philosophical perspectives on religion. 4. Critical thinking in the areas of religious and scientific inquiry.560 UNIVERSITY CATALOG 5. The ability to contribute to the field of reli - gion and the sciences in the areas of research and writing. 6.

Division of Humanities\u2014Humanities Program For more than fifty years, Loma Linda Univer - sity has officially prized \"wholeness.\" Because of the specialized nature of Loma Linda Univer - sity's curricula, a humanities component of the health-related professional programs is important to realize the university's motto, \"To make man whole.\" Health care and research are becoming in - creasingly interdisciplinary, and only a breadth of integrated knowledge adequately prepares tomor - row's leaders. Loma Linda University alumni will both influence and be influenced by a complex society; and a disciplined study of the humanities is no luxury. In light of the foregoing considerations, the Board of Trustees voted in December 2006 to establish a Humanities Program within the School of Religion. The goal is to establish a small core of humanities scholars, beginning with one profes - sor each in literature and in history, who will not only teach humanities courses, but who will also develop innovative means to enhance the humani - ties ethos on campus.Loma Linda University's Humanities Program has two emphases: undergraduate and profes - sional education. Undergraduate. The Humanities Program for undergraduates largely builds on the humani - ties course work that students bring from prior college enrollment. However, the University is now searching for the ideal way to meaningfully embed the humanities within students' ongoing professional studies. Ideas that are being explored include: (a) a new capstone academic course in which students examine their personal and professional values; and (b) a wholeness portfolio that requires students to explore the integration of personal values, societal needs, and professional aspirations. The Humanities Program furthers Loma Linda University's educational objectives: Values-based education Critical-thinking skills Effective communication Contribution of the humanities to society562 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Lifelong learning Human wholeness Professional. The impact of the Humanities Pro - gram on professional education is largely outside the classroom\u2014lectures, workshops, film discus - sions, and brown bag sessions. These experiences are important in themselves, and the humani - ties faculty will greatly strengthen this aspect of campus life. However, the University envisions honors programs that will require instructor-led integrative discussions\u2014often supplemented with assigned reading. Discussion has begun with various schools of the University regarding the development of honors programs that focus on demonstrated excellence in one's specialized field of study, as well as integration of that knowledge with at least one humanities discipline (e.g., his - tory, literature, religion).

This Catalog describes who we are and what we have to offer. It will familiarize you with the philosophy and structure of our pro - grams, and will provide you with a listing of the participating faculty. Loma Linda is a religious, nonprofit institution that welcomes students and staff from a broad spectrum of religious persuasions while reserving the right to give preference to qualified members of its sponsoring denomination. As stated in its nondiscrimination policy, the institution \"af - firms that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and they should so be regarded by all people.\" Since several of the professions\u2014for which programs within the School of Science and Technology (SST) prepare students\u2014have a tradition of advocacy for oppressed peoples, it is important that the institution, faculty, and staff demonstrate their acceptance of and willingness to assist those in our society who are less privi - leged. The University actively sponsors several programs that move the institutional health care personnel resources and expertise into the local, national, and international communities to work with otherwise underserved populations. This component of service is an integral part of the statement of mission and a message intended to be captured in the Good Samaritan sculpture that occupies a central position on the campus. The School of Science and Technology, as part of the University, has expectations of students, fac - ulty, and staff in the areas of conduct and behavior while they are on campus or involved in school or University activities. The school does not dis - criminate on the basis of race, color, gender, age, ethnic or national origin, or handicap. Enrollment of students in SST programs is not conditioned on their political or sexual orientation; in these areas, the school's policy is directed towards conduct or disruptive behavior, not orientation. In support of this position, we expect our students, faculty, and staff to demonstrate unwavering respect for the diversity of others and to interact with integ - rity\u2014never forgetting the standards that guide professional actions. Further, we expect our pro - grams through their faculty to develop competent, compassionate, ethical professionals who possess the knowledge, skills, and values to equip them for a life dedicated to service to all those in need\u2014regardless of their lifestyles. You will find vigorous academic programs that will stretch your mind as you take time to make new discoveries, get to understand our world, and apply Christ-centered values to your life and profession. Our administrators, faculty, and staff are here to work with you and help you prepare for your future as a caring, Christian professional in the world of service to mankind.

Buckles, D.S.W.Dean, School of Science and Technology School Foundations 565 School Foundations The School of Science and Technology (SST)\u2014 one of Loma Linda University's newest schools\u2014 includes the Departments of Earth and Biologi - cal Sciences, Counseling and Family Sciences, Psychology, and Social Work and Social Ecology. Many of the programs offered have matured on campus for a decade or more; one program was established half a century ago. The school of - fers degree programs through the doctoral level, postdegree certificates, and a certificate program in Spanish; as well as courses that meet the Uni - versity's general education requirements. Technol - ogy programs, such as e-Health Technology, are currently being developed by the school. PhiLoso Phy The School of Science and Technology is mission driven and academically incorporates the Uni - versity's commitment to the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ, which produces whole - ness within transformed lives. Transformation is a lifelong faith-and-learning process\u2014a process committed to pursuit of the highest levels of scholarship, professionalism, and spiritual well-being. This pursuit seeks to understand and pro - mote healthy minds, communities, social systems, families, and the environment. Wholeness for self and for others is central to a balance between mind, body, and spirit. Such wholeness manifests itself in a life of service to humanity, to the environment, and to God. The School of Science and Technology values the time-honored and separate traditions in higher education for \"academic\" and \"professional\" pro - grams; and it advocates the integration of knowl - edge and research, blending the \"pure\" with the \"applied\" sciences. In the School of Science and Technology of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meaning. Because this quest is served by knowledge, gradu - ate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their field of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by which knowledge is created and transformed into wisdom.obJeCtives The School of Science and Technology attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communica - tion. 3. Relating intellectual achievement to the ser - vice of humankind. Application and Admissions aPPL iCation and aCC ePtan Ce application procedure 1. The application instructions, available on the Web at <www.llu.edu/ central/ apply/index.page>, allow students to apply online and begin an application. Applications and all supporting information, transcripts, test results, and references should be submitted by the deadline posted on the application, per degree. 2. Complete official transcripts of all academic records from all colleges, universities, and professional or technical schools must be provided for official acceptance into a pro - gram. It is the applicant's responsibility to arrange to have the transcripts\u2014including official English translations, if applicable\u2014sent directly to Admissions Processing. Transcripts that come via an intermediary are unacceptable. 3. A personal interview is often desirable and is required by some programs. The interview should be arranged with the coordinator of 566 UNIVERSITY CATALOG the program in which the student wishes to study. acceptance procedure 1. When the program that the student wishes to enter has evaluated the applications and made its recommendation, the dean of the School of Science and Technology takes of - ficial action and notifies the applicant. The applicant must respond affirmatively before becoming eligible to register in the School of Science and Technology. 2. As part of registration, accepted students will be asked to file with Student Health Service a medical history with evidence of certain immunizations. 3. Transcripts of records and all other applica - tion documents are retained by the Univer - sity and may not be withdrawn and used for any purpose. Records of students who do not enroll or who withdraw prior to comple - tion are retained for two years from the date of original acceptance to a School of Science and Technology program. 4. New students are required to pass a back - ground check before they register for classes. Undergrad Uate Programs admission requirements high s Choo L grad Uation reQUirement Students applying to Loma Linda University after finishing high school are required to furnish an official transcript as evidence of completion of high school. A high school G.P .A. of at least 2.5 (on a 4-point scale) is expected for admission to Loma Linda University undergraduate programs. Students transferring to Loma Linda University after completing some course work at another college or university are also required to furnish transcripts for all of these courses. A minimum grade of C (2.0) is required for all college transfer courses, unless otherwise specified in specific program requirements. An overall college G.P .A. of at least 2.5 to 3.0 is expected, depending on the program to which the student applies. trans CriPts Transcripts are accepted only when sent directly to the University Records office by the issuing institution. Transcripts received by the University become the property of the University and will not be released to the student or forwarded to any other institution upon request of the student. Undergraduate degree requirements The requirements for an undergraduate degree consist of (1) general studies courses (68 units, a portion of which may be met by the student's major), (2) the courses required for the specific undergraduate major or degree program, and (3) general elective courses. general studies requirements domain 1: sP irit UaL and CUL tUraL heritage (28-32 QU arter U nits) spiritual h eritage (16) A minimum of 4 units for each year the student is enrolled in a Seventh-day Adventist college or university. Cultural h eritage (12-16) Must include one course dealing with human di - versity among peers (e.g., cultural anthropology). Other courses to be selected from civilization/history, fine arts, literature, modern language, per - forming/visual arts (2 quarter units maximum), or philosophy. domain 2: sC ientifi C in QUiry and ana Lysis (24-32 QU arter U nits) natural s ciences (16) Courses in various biological or biomedical fields, chemistry, physics, or earth sciences. Application and Admissions 567 social s ciences (12-16) Two or more of the following required: Anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psychology, and sociology. domain 3: Comm UniCation (9-13 QUarter U nits) Must include a full sequence in freshman Eng - lish that meets the baccalaureate degree require - ments at an accredited college or university. Also may include courses in computer information systems, critical thinking, and public speaking. domain 4: h eaLth and W eLLness (2-6 QUarter U nits) Must include two physical activities totaling at least 1 unit, and one course in personal health or nutrition. domain 5: g enera L st Udies e LeCtives Electives from the foregoing subjects may be chosen to complete the 68 units. major field and cognate requirements These requirements are described under each program in this CATALOG. They consist of the courses in the major field, as well as cognates\u2014which are supporting courses in a different field that are required for the degree. minor field A minor is an area outside of the student's major field, in which the student takes enough courses to acquire a basic introduction to the subject. Each program defines the requirements of subject minors. minimum required grades The minimum required grade is C for courses that apply to the undergraduate degree.grad Uate d egree reQUirements admission requirements A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equiva - lent) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission to the School of Science and Technology's graduate programs. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate preparation, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the applicant should note the specific requirements of the cho - sen program. Deficiencies may be fulfilled while enrolled; prerequisites must be completed prior to matriculation. scholarship Applicants are expected to present an under - graduate record with a grade-point average of B (3.0) or better in the overall program and in the major field. Depending on program-specific criteria, some students with an overall grade-point average between 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades of the junior and senior years are superior or there is other evidence of capability. graduate r ecord e xamination Scores on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are required with applications for admission to many degree programs. New test scores are needed if it has been more than five years since the last test was taken. Applicants are advised to request information specific to their proposed program of study. For complete information about the GRE, please visit their Web site at <www.gre.org>; or write to Educational Testing Service, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, CA 94701 (for the West); and P .O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541 (for the East). For GRE publications (including study materials), call 800/537-3160. When pressure of time makes it impossible to secure the results of the GRE or its alternatives, 568 UNIVERSITY CATALOG students seeking admission who have otherwise above-average achievement may be admitted provisionally, subject to review when the required test results are received. In such cases, test results are to be submitted within the first quarter of at - tendance. Certain programs with limited admissions may require the GRE results prior to acceptance, while some programs require the subject test. Students should consult student guides from individual programs for further information. Programs that do not require the GRE must submit one additional measure of a candidate's preparation for graduate study. This may be either an evaluation of critical essay-writing skills, the Miller Analogies Test, the results of a structured interview, or other specified program criteria. re-entrance Students who are currently enrolled in the School of Science and Technology may request transfer to a different program or a more ad - vanced degree level by contacting the School of Science and Technology Admissions Office for information on an abbreviated application and instructions for submitting the appropriate sup - porting documents. Transcripts on file with the University are acceptable. english-language competence All international students are encouraged (par - ticularly those who do not have an adequate score on TOEFL or MTELP or other evidence of Eng - lish proficiency) to attend an intensive American Language Institute prior to entering their program because further study of English may be required to assure academic progress. from m aster's to Ph .d . degree bypassing master's degree A graduate student at this University may proceed first to a master's degree. If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, this intention should be declared even if the first objective is a master's degree. If after admission to the master's degree pro - gram a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree, an abbreviated application should be com - pleted and submitted, along with appropriate sup - porting documents, to the School of Science and Technology Admissions Office. If the award of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before embark - ing on doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance commit - tee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that have been completed in the appropriate field and are of equivalent quality and scope to his/her doctoral program. second master's degree A student who wishes to qualify for an addition - al master's degree in a different discipline may apply. The dean of the School of Science and Tech - nology and the faculty of the program the student wishes to enter will consider such a request on its individual merits. Concurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a School of Sci - ence and Technology program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exceptions to this are the combined degrees programs, discussed in the following paragraph. Combined degrees Students may not be admitted to a School of Sci - ence and Technology program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exceptions to this are the combined degrees programs. Certificate programs The School of Science and Technology offers several postbaccalaureate certificate programs. Students accepted into such programs will be as - signed to an advisor who will work with them as Application and Admissions 569 they fulfill the program requirements. Students will be required to maintain a B- (2.7) grade-point average, with no course grade below C (2.0). All certificate students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course (numbered between 500 and 600). master of a rts/ master of sCienCe/master of s oCiaL Wor K advisor and guidance committee Each student accepted into a degree program is assigned an advisor who helps to arrange the pro - gram of study to meet University requirements; subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervi - sion of a guidance committee. This committee is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging courses, screening thesis topics (where applicable), guid - ing research, administering final written and/or oral examinations, evaluating the thesis and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and ultimately recommending the student for graduation. subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subject and classified either as prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Appli - cants lacking certain subject or program prerequi - sites may not be admitted to the master's degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) and accept - able grades are reported. However, subject defi - ciencies do not exclude an applicant from admis - sion or enrollment; but these must be removed as specified by the advisor or dean, usually during the first full quarter of study at this University. study plan The student's advisor should develop with the student a written outline of the complete gradu - ate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This will serve as a guide to both the student and the advisor as well as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful con - sultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of all required courses. time limit The time allowed from admission to the School of Science and Technology to conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five years. Some consideration may be given to a short extension of time if, in the dean's opinion, such is merited. Course credit allowed toward the master's degree is nullified seven years from the date of course completion. Nullified courses may be revalidated, upon successful petition, through reading, conferences, written reports, or examina - tion to assure currency in the content. residence Students must meet the residence requirements indicated for their particular program (never less than one academic quarter). The master's degree candidate must complete one quarter of full-time study at the University or perform the thesis research at the University. Although the number of units students take varies by program, students are expected to work closely with their program to assure that their course loads are consistent with program requirements, as well as degree-comple - tion options and timelines. minimum required grade-point average The required minimum grade-point average is B (3.0) on all work for the master's degree. This average must be maintained in formal courses and in research, computed separately. A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B grade on all work accepted for transfer and on all work taken at this University, computed separately. In some cases, programs have specified higher or additional requirements. Students should consult with their particular program of study.570 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Professional performance probation Applied professional programs may recommend that the student be placed on professional perfor - mance probation. Details are contained in pro - gram guides for the programs concerned. Comprehensive and final examinations The student must take the written, oral, and final examinations prescribed by the program on or before the published dates. If a candidate fails to pass the oral or written examination for a gradu - ate degree, the committee files with the dean a written analysis of the candidate's status, with recommendations regarding the student's future relation to the school. The student receives a copy of the committee's recommendation. research competence Student skills required in research, language, in - vestigation, and computation are specified in each program description in this CATALOG. thesis Students writing a thesis must register for at least 1 unit of thesis credit. The research and thesis preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for candidacy. The student must register and pay tuition for the - sis credit, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course require - ments, and has registered for but not completed the research and thesis, continuous registration is to be maintained until the manuscript has been accepted. This involves a quarterly enrollment fee paid at the beginning of each quarter. Candidacy Admission to the School of Science and Technol - ogy or designation of regular graduate standing does not constitute admission of the student to candidacy for a graduate degree. After achieving regular status, admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Science and Tech - nology Form A) from the student to the dean, on recommendation of the student's advisor and the program coordinator or department chair. Students petitioning the School of Science and Technology for candidacy for the master's degree must present a satisfactory grade record, include a statement of the proposed thesis or dissertation topic (where applicable) that has been approved by the student's guidance committee, and note any other qualification prescribed by the program. Students are usually advanced to candidacy dur - ing the third quarter after entering their course of study toward a degree in the School of Science and Technology. specific program requirements In addition to the foregoing, the student is subject to the requirements stated in the section of the CATALOG governing the specific program chosen. religion requirement All master's degree students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course. Courses (numbered between 500 and 600). Students should check with their programs for specific guidelines. Combined degrees programs A number of combined degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide more compre - hensive preparation in clinical applications and the biomedical sciences. Both require concurrent admission to two programs in the School of Sci - ence and Technology and/or a professional school in the University. These curricula are described in greater detail under the heading \"Combined De - grees Programs\" in this section of the CATALOG. thesis and d issertation The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the stu - dent's guidance committee. The student is urged Application and Admissions 571 to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as is feasible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. format guide Instructions for the preparation and format of the publishable paper, thesis, or dissertation are in the \"Thesis and Dissertation Format Guide,\" available through the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor. Consultation with the disserta - tion editor can help the student avoid formatting errors that would require him/her to retype large sections of manuscript. The last day for submit - ting copies to the school office in final approved form is published in the events calendar (available from the academic dean's office). binding The cost of binding copies of the thesis or dis - sertation to be deposited in the University library and appropriate department or school collection will be paid for by the student's department. The student will be responsible for paying the cost of binding additional personal copies. doCtor of Phi Loso Phy The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded for evidence of mature scholarship; productive prom - ise; and active awareness of the history, resources, and demands of a specialized field. advisor and guidance committee Each student, upon acceptance into a degree pro - gram, is assigned an advisor who helps arrange the study program. Subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. The School of Science and Technology requires ad - visors for Doctor of Philosophy degree candidates to have demonstrated scholarship productivity in their chosen disciplines. Each program maintains a list of qualified doctoral degree mentors. The guidance committee, usually chaired by the advi - sor, is responsible to and works with the coordina - tor of the student's program in arranging course sequences, screening dissertation topics, recom - mending candidacy, guiding research, adminis - tering written and oral examinations, evaluating the dissertation/project and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and recommending the student for graduation. subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subjects and classified as either prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking subject or program prereq- uisites may not be admitted to the Ph.D. degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) with accept - able grades. Subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but they must be removed as specified by the advisor or dean, usu - ally at the beginning of the graduate experience at this University. study plan The student's advisor should develop with the student a written outline of the complete gradu - ate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This serves as a guide to both the student and the advisor, as well as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consul - tation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of required courses. time limit Completion of the graduate experience signals currency and competence in the discipline. The dynamic nature of the biological sciences makes dilatory or even leisurely pursuit of the degree unacceptable. Seven years are allowed for comple - tion after admission to the Ph.D. degree program. Extension of time may be granted on petition if recommended by the guidance committee to the dean of the School of Science and Technology. Course credit allowed toward the doctorate is nullified eight years from the date of course completion. Nullified courses may be revalidated, 572 UNIVERSITY CATALOG upon successful petition, through reading, confer - ence, written reports, or examination to assure currency in the content. residence The School of Science and Technology requires two years of residency for the doctoral degrees\u2014D.M.F.T, Psy.D., Ph.D.\u2014spent on the campus of the University after enrollment in a doctoral degree program. During residence, students devote full time to graduate activity in courses, research, or a combination of these. A full load of courses is 8 or more units each quarter; 36 or more clock hours per week is full time in research. Students may be advised to pursue studies for limited periods at special facilities not available at Loma Linda University. Such time may be consid - ered residence if the arrangement is approved in advance by the dean of the School of Science and Technology. The spirit and demands of doctoral degree study require full-time devotion to courses, research, reading, and reflection. But neither the passage of time nor preoccupation with study assures suc - cess. Evidence of high scholarship and original contribution to the field or professional compe - tence form the basis for determining the awarding of the degree. minimum required grade-point average Students must maintain a grade-point average of at least a B (3.0) to continue in regular stand - ing toward the doctorate. This average is to be computed separately for courses and research. Courses in which a student earns a grade between C (2.0) and B (3.0) may or may not apply toward the degree, at the discretion of the guidance com - mittee. A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B average on all work accepted for transfer credit and on all work taken at this University, computed separately. Professional performance probation Applied professional programs may recommend that the student be placed on professional per -formance probation. Details are contained in the program guides for the programs concerned. scholarly competence Doctoral degree students demonstrate competen - cy in scholarship along with research and profes - sional development. Expectations and standards of achievement with the tools of investigation, natural and synthetic languages, and computers are specified in this section of the CATALOG for each program. Comprehensive examinations The doctoral degree candidate is required to take comprehensive written and oral examina - tions over the principal areas of study to ascertain capacity for independent, productive, scientific work; and to determine whether further courses are required before the final year of preparation for the doctorate is undertaken. The program co - ordinator is responsible for arranging preparation and administration of the examination, as well as its evaluation and subsequent reports of results. Success in the comprehensive examination is a prerequisite to candidacy (see below). Students cannot be admitted to the examination until the following requirements have been met: Demonstrated reading knowledge of one foreign language, if applicable; Completed the majority of units required beyond the master's degree or its equivalent. the final oral examination After completion of the dissertation and not later than a month before the date of graduation, the doctoral degree candidate is required to appear before an examining committee for the final oral examination. If a candidate fails to pass this final examination for a graduate degree, the examining committee files with the dean a written analysis of the can - didate's status, with recommendations about the student's future relation to the school. The student receives a copy of the committee's recommenda - tion. Application and Admissions 573 Project (required for the Doctor of Psychology and Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy degrees) All Doctor of Psychology degree students must register for at least 1 unit of project credit. This should be done in the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and project preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and project, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee of $75 (2010-2011) to be paid during registration each quarter. A similar continuing-registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. dissertation (required for the Doctor of Philosophy degree)All doctoral students must register for at least 1 unit of research credit. This should be done in the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Consultation with the Faculty of Graduate Stud - ies dissertation editor can prevent the student from committing formatting errors that would require retyping large sections of the manuscript. Students register and pay tuition for the disser - tation, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and dissertation, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee of $75 (2010-2011), to be paid during registration each quarter. A similar continuing-registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Doctoral dissertations are reported to Univer - sity Microfilms International and to the National Opinion Research Center. The Faculty of Gradu - ate Studies provides appropriate information and forms. Candidacy Admission to the School of Science and Technol - ogy does not constitute candidacy for a graduate degree. Admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Science and Technology Form A) from the student to the dean, with sup - port from the student's advisor and the program chair. The student's petition for candidacy for the Doc - tor of Philosophy degree will include, in addition, confirmation that comprehensive written and oral examinations have been passed. Students expecting the award of the doctorate at a June graduation should have achieved candi - dacy no later than the previous November 15. One full quarter must be allowed between the achieve - ment of candidacy and the quarter of completion. specific program requirements Doctoral programs differ from each other. The unique program requirements appear in the programs section of this CATALOG (Section III) and in the program guides available from specific departments. religion requirement All doctoral students should take at least three 3-unit religion courses (numbered between 500 and 600). Students should check with their pro - grams for specific guidelines. Combined d egrees Programs A number of combined degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide additional preparation in clinical, professional, or basic areas related to the student's field of interest. All require 574 UNIVERSITY CATALOG concurrent admission to the School of Science and Technology and a professional school in the University. The combined degrees programs pro - vide opportunity for especially well-qualified and motivated students to pursue professional and graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or investigation of problems of health and disease in man. For admission to a combined degrees program, the student must have a baccalaureate degree; must qualify for admission to the School of Sci - ence and Technology; and must already be ad - mitted to the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, the School of Religion, or the School of Public Health. Application may be made at any point in the student's progress in the profes - sional school, though it is usually made during the sophomore year. Students in this curriculum study toward the M.A., M.S., M.S.W., Psy.D., or Ph.D. degree. Students may be required to interrupt their pro - fessional study for two or more years (as needed) for courses and research for the graduate degree sought. Elective time in the professional school may be spent in meeting School of Science and Technology requirements. The student's concurrent status is regarded as continuous until the program is completed or un - til discontinuance is recommended by the School of Science and Technology or the professional school. The usual degree requirements apply. The following combined degrees programs are offered in conjunction with the School of Science and Technology. (See Combined Degrees Pro - grams at the end of Section III.) Biology or Geology with Medicine or Dentistry (M.S./M.D., M.S./D.D.S., Ph.D./M.D., or Ph.D./D.D.S.)

The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. Academic Information Conditions of r egistration, residen Ce, attendan Ce academic residence A student must meet the residence require - ments indicated for a particular degree, never less than one academic quarter. A year of residence is defined as three quarters of academic work. The master's degree candidate must complete one quarter of full-time study or perform the thesis research work at the University or an approved off-campus location. A student is in full-time resi - dence if registered for at least 8 units. A maximum of 12 units may be taken without special petition unless the student is enrolled in an approved block-registration program or the program re - quirements specify otherwise. Financial Information 575 transfer credits Transfer credits will not be used to offset course work at this University that earns less than a B average. This transfer is limited to credits that have not already been applied to a degree and for which a grade of B (3.0) or better has been recorded. A maximum of 9 quarter units that have been previously applied to another degree may be accepted as transfer credits upon petition.

Criminal Justice\u2014ST 591 Criminal Justice\u2014ST (m .s . ) FROYLANA HEREDIA-MILLER, Director faCUL ty A complete list of all part-time and voluntary faculty can be viewed on the department Web site. Crime disrupts personal and community rela - tionships, endangers public health and safety, and threatens the moral contours of everyday social life. Loma Linda University's mission, \"To make man whole,\" provides a powerful and much-needed context in which criminal justice can be addressed on the basis of healing and restoration. The principles of restorative justice elevate the dimensions of justice that promote the acceptance of responsibility, promote the fulfillment of obliga - tions, embrace reconciliation, and culminate in the restoration of personal and social relationships. This multidisciplinary approach to deviance and the administration of justice takes into consider - ation the social, physical, and spiritual well-being of victims, offenders, and communities; and provides a deeper understanding of crime and the struggle of the modern criminal justice system. CriminaL J UstiCe\u2014m .s . mission The mission of the Criminal Justice Program is to prepare students to think critically and analytical - ly about the problems of crime and social control in contemporary society. Program objectives Students will demonstrate: The ability to integrate and utilize knowl - edge of social science and criminological theory in the application to problems of criminal justice. An understanding of the dimensions and causes of crime and delinquency. An understanding of the structure of the American criminal justice system. An understanding of the ethical principles that guide the concepts of justice and fair - ness within professional criminal justice practice. The ability to use empirically-based research to analyze and critically evaluate practice and criminal justice policy in order to effect system change. An understanding of diverse people and cultures as these interact with the criminal justice system. An understanding of the differences be - tween retributive and restorative justice ap - proaches in addressing the effects of crime. general overview The 48-quarter unit program begins with 26 units of core course work required for all students. Course work during the first year of study is di - vided into three professional areas of study, which include: criminal justice, religion, ethics, and so - cial research methods. At the end of the first year, students select their concentration area of policy, planning, and administration or forensic mental health\u2014each requiring 6 units of course work, plus 6 units of concentration-specific selectives. To complete the program, the student has two options: 1. Nonthesis: Professional practica (540 hours of integrated practicum and seminar), 1 unit of practica orientation, and 9 units of didac - tic selectives; OR 2. Thesis: 6 units of academic thesis and 4 units of didactic selectives. Concentration descriptions Policy and administration\u2014Students opting for the policy, planning, and administration concen - tration gain knowledge and skills in the public administration, planning, and coordination of 592 UNIVERSITY CATALOG governmentally operated criminal and/or juvenile justice systems. Students acquire an appreciation for working with community entities to develop, coordinate, and evaluate these systems in re - sponse to community needs. In addition, students develop an understanding of the policy-planning process and the role that criminal or juvenile justice planning councils perform in consensually revising or creating policies aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of criminal and juvenile justice systems. Forensic mental health\u2014Forensic mental health is a specialized branch of professional practice in which the clinical and criminal justice worlds overlap. Students choosing this area focus on the needs of individuals in the criminal or juvenile justice systems who have serious emotional dis - orders and/or severe mental illness, and may also present with co-occurring substance abuse. Stu - dents gain knowledge and skills in treatment pro - gramming within a forensic mental health frame - work. In addition, this context prepares students to assess and provide expert testimony regarding continued institutionalization versus readiness for outpatient psychosocial rehabilitation, including the development and implementation of assertive community treatment plans. Both concentrations emphasize a thoughtful reflection about issues in criminal justice that will provide students with a deeper understanding of the logic influencing policy, administration, and practice issues affecting the field. Prerequisite This degree program builds on a broad liberal arts (general education) foundation. Consistent with this view, the program assesses the liberal arts foundation of students applying for the M.S. degree in criminal justice. A balance of course work in three liberal arts areas: Humanities (e.g., history, philosophy, literature, art, music, etc.) 20.0-24.0 English and Communication Skills (e.g., oral and written communication media, etc.) 9.0-13.0Natural and Social Sciences (e.g., mathematics, human biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, human development, ethnic studies, economics, political science or government, etc.) 24.0-32.0 Students not meeting the minimum number of units in any of the foregoing areas are required to complete additional course work prior to enrolling in the related criminal justice classes. Please note: All prerequisite requirements must be completed before advancement to candidacy (prior to beginning the advanced curriculum). Unit values represent a quarter system of mea - surement. Content from multiple courses may be used to meet most requirements. admission requirements This program follows the admission require - ments of the School of Science and Technology, including: 1.

The population explosion of older adults has gen - erated increasing interest in the field of gerontol - ogy. Gerontology is the multidisciplinary-multi - dimensional study of aging and aging processes. It combines the study of physical, mental, social, and spiritual changes that affect individuals as they age. Emphasis is placed on the knowledge and skills required for competent practice, with considerable attention given to understanding the social, cultural, and economic factors that affect services for this population. mission The mission of the Gerontology Program is to provide graduate-level education for future and current professionals in gerontology who are dedicated to enhancing the lives of older adults through advanced interventions at the micro, macro, and mezzo levels of practice.Program o bJeCtives Students will demonstrate the ability to integrate human behavior and developmen - tal theories of aging, incorporating a biopsy - chosocial-spiritual orientation to geriatric practice. Students will demonstrate the ability to use research in evaluating the effectiveness of practice and programs in achieving intended outcomes for older adults. Students will demonstrate the ability to in - tegrate into practice an understanding of the life experiences and unique needs of older adults belonging to specific racial, ethnic, so - cioeconomic groups; of men and women; and of those with different sexual orientations. Students will demonstrate knowledge of professional ethics to assist older adults who have diverse cultural, spiritual, and ethnic values and beliefs. Students will demonstrate the ability to complete a comprehensive assessment of biopsychosocial-spiritual factors that affect older adults' well-being. Students will demonstrate knowledge of the policies that shape and regulate the contin - uum of care and services available to older adults.626 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Students will demonstrate knowledge of the importance of the current issues in geron - tology and the importance of the relation - ship of gerontology to other disciplines and professions, such as social work, psychology, medicine, nursing, and public health. genera L overvie W The 48-unit program begins with 26 units of core course work required for all students. Courses during the first year of study are divided into four professional areas: social science theory, religion and ethics, practice, and research methods. At the end of the first year, the student selects a concen - tration area (policy, planning, and administration; or clinical services) requiring 14 units of concen - tration-specific course work. Regardless of the concentration students choose, they are given the option of either a thesis or a nonthesis (professional practicum). 1. Thesis: Students who choose the thesis op - tion complete 6 related units of research and 4 units of selectives. 2. Nonthesis: Students choosing the internship option complete 1unit of practical orienta - tion, 540 hours of integrated practicum and seminar, and 9 units of didactic selectives. Con Centration d esCriPtion Policy, planning, and administration: Students opting for the policy, planning, and administra - tion concentration gain knowledge and skills in the public administration, planning, and coor - dination of services for older adults. Students acquire an appreciation for the unique policy and systems structure influencing the delivery of ser - vices to older adults. Within this framework, stu - dents develop an understanding of the issues and challenges in creating and sustaining responsive systems of care for older adults and their families. Clinical services: Students opting for the clinical services concentration develop knowledge and skills in locating and providing resources, ser - vices, and opportunities for older adults and their families; as well as acquiring knowledge that sup - ports enhancing the problem-solving and coping skills of older adults and their caregivers. Students gain an appreciation for the social support factors and community systems that create opportunities or exacerbate problems in daily living. Students develop an understanding of the issues that im - pact the creation of effective systems of care and responsive social policies. Both concentrations emphasize a thoughtful reflection about the multidimensional issues in gerontology that will provide students with a deeper understanding of policy, administration, and practice issues affecting the field. Prere QUiste A balance of course work in three liberal arts areas: Humanities (e.g., history, philosophy, literature, art, music, etc.) 20.0-24.0 English and Communication Skills (e.g., oral and written communication media, etc.) 9.0-13.0 Natural and Social Sciences (e.g., mathematics, human biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, human development, ethnic studies, economics, political science or government, etc.) 24.0-32.0 Students not meeting the minimum number of units in any of the foregoing areas are required to complete additional course work prior to enrolling in the related M.S.W. degree classes. Please note: All prerequisite requirements must be completed before advancement to candidacy (prior to beginning the advanced curriculum). Unit values represent the quarter system of mea - surement.

Canadian campus program (This program is not accredited by the Commis - sion on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE), the accrediting body for the AAMFT.) The Canadian campus program facilitates Cana - dian residents' obtaining a Loma Linda University graduate degree in marital and family therapy while completing their academic work and clini - cal training in Western Canada. The program is the only one that provides marital and family therapy training in Alberta or British Colum - bia. The program has graduated more than 200 therapists since its first graduating class in l991. The Canadian campus program prepares gradu - ates to function as marital and family therapists in Canada, specifically in Alberta. Graduates have also established their competence as therapists in provinces across Canada, as well as the United States. Depending on undergraduate preparation and the course work selected, graduates of the program go on to obtain registration as psycholo - gists in Alberta (with the College of Alberta Psy - chologists) or as registered social workers (with the Alberta College of Social Workers). In addition, students from other nonpsychology or nonsocial work academic backgrounds can be registered as counselors with the Canadian Counseling Asso - ciation. Loma Linda University is accredited by the West - ern Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) in the United States, and the Canadian campus program is recognized by Alberta Advanced Education (Private Institutions) as an approved graduate degree-granting program. The Canadian campus program is officially operated by Loma Linda University and meets WASC accreditation requirements. Applications for admission are directed through the University Records Office at Loma Linda University; and official acceptance, candidacy status, and graduation are monitored through the University\u2014specifically the chair of the Department of Counseling and Family Sci - ences, and the dean of the School of Science and Technology.634 UNIVERSITY CATALOG The Canadian campus program is an innova - tive venture that combines the teaching expertise of the Loma Linda University faculty, Canadian campus program faculty, and adjunct instructors from the local professional community. Specific attention is paid to the importance of Canadian content in courses such as cross-cultural counsel - ing, child abuse and family violence, and law and ethics to make the theoretical and practice aspects of the degree fit the Canadian context. The program emphasizes integration of theory, practice, and person of the therapist. Clinical training placement for two consecutive years is provided while the student is taking academic courses. The student is also required to engage in some personal therapy while s/he is in the pro - gram. The clinical training component is fulfilled two-to-three days per week at the student's city of residence\u2014typically, Edmonton, Calgary, or Red Deer. The program has approximately twenty-five clinical sites throughout the province where students can obtain supervised clinical practice in individual, couple, and family therapy.The Canadian campus is centrally located in Lacombe, Alberta, to accommodate the commuter cohort of students that travel to campus one day per week, and one week per month for classes. The library on the campus of Canadian University College boasts one of the largest collections of marital and family therapy journals and texts in the province, as well as being part of the NEOS library consortium system that connects students to all the major university libraries in Alberta. In addition, students have access to the Loma Linda University California Campus Library system through EBSCO HOST. Students graduating from this program obtain positions as marital and family therapists in hospitals, community service agencies, family counseling agencies, addiction treatment centers, adolescent residential treatment centers, school systems, private practices, and in educational set - tings.

The mission of these programs is to bring health, healing, wholeness, and hope to individu - als, families, and communities through educa - tion, research, clinical training, and community service. The Ph.D. degree program accomplishes this by preparing scientist-practitioners who will advance the body of knowledge through which marital and family therapists promote the health and well-being of individuals, couples, families, and communities. The D.M.F.T. degree program accomplishes this by focusing on developing, evaluating, and administering intervention pro - grams that benefit individuals, couples, families, and communities. the marriage and family therapy profession Marriage and family therapy is a distinct men - tal health profession based on the premise that relationships are fundamental to the health and well-being of individuals, families and commu - nities. Marriage and family therapists (MFTs) evaluate and treat mental and emotional disorders and other health and behavioral problems; and address a wide array of relationship issues within 638 UNIVERSITY CATALOG the context of families and larger systems. The federal government has designated marital and family therapy a core mental health profession\u2014along with psychiatry, psychology, social work, and psychiatric nursing. All 50 states also support and regulate the profession by licensing or certify - ing marriage and family therapists. accreditation Loma Linda University's academic programs are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The Ph.D. in marital and family therapy and the D.M.F.T. degree programs are accredited by the Commission on Accredita - tion of Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE), the accrediting body associated with the American Association for Marriage and Fam - ily Therapy. COAMFTE accreditation means that students meet national practice standards for mar - riage and family therapy. This accreditation facili - tates graduates' eligibility to practice in California as well as across the country. Additional informa - tion about COAMFTE-accredited programs can be found online at <www.aamft.org>.

Certificates The Department of Counseling and Family Sciences offers certificate programs that can be combined with the Ph.D. or D.M.F.T. degrees to broaden a student's marital and family therapy skills and marketability. Students wishing to add specializations in the following areas must formally apply and be accepted into the desired certificate program(s). Prior to application, the student is advised to consult with the coordinator of the certificate program. Child Life Specialist Certificate Clinical Mediation Certificate Drug and Alcohol Counseling Certificate Family Counseling Certificate Family Life Education Certificate Medical Family Therapy Certificate (pro - posed) School Counseling Certificate: California Pu - pil Personnel Services Credential (PPS) (open to counseling and MFT students only) Core ideas guiding the marriage and family therapy doctoral programs Relational systems: People are best understood within the cultural, spiritual, and relational systems in which they are embedded. Change therefore occurs in the context of family, com - munity, and interpersonal relationships. This program focuses on both the structured relational patterns of communication and interaction and on the systems of meaning that define and shape these patterns. Wholeness: The program encourages wholeness by attending to the physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of human experience. These dimensions reciprocally interact at every level. Social forces: The program is guided by a belief that social contexts and processes influence mean - ings, values, and people's understandings of self, family, and others. Particular emphasis is placed on: research focusing on social forces relevant to the distinctive multicultural mix of families in the southern California region; the interrelationship between faith and fam - ily relationships throughout the world, and the effects of the changing health care sys - tem and of medical technology; as well as collaboration among education, family, work, and legal systems. Marital and Family Therapy\u2014ST 639 Healing power of relationships: As people become more connected to each other and their communities, the potential for growth and heal - ing are enhanced and the opportunity for making positive contributions maximized. Students are encouraged to develop their therapeutic relation - ship and community involvement skills such that they can cocreate an environment of safety, respect, compassion, openness, and community participation. Diversity: Congruent with an appreciation of the importance of social forces is an interest in and re - spect for the diverse experiences and perceptions of human beings. Different social contexts\u2014such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and socioeco - nomic status\u2014result in a wide variety of mean - ings and behavior patterns in marriages, families, and intimate relationships. The program seeks to create a diverse mix of students and faculty, and to challenge all who are involved to learn from the richness of multiple perspectives. Empirical process: The program encourages clini - cal work and theory development grounded in an empirical understanding of human experience. Students are offered the opportunity to develop their capacities to utilize inductive and deductive reasoning as well as objectivity, subjectivity, and intersubjectivity in therapy, program develop - ment, and evaluation, and research. Education and prevention: Connections at fam - ily, school, and community levels are important components of resilience. The program empha - sizes helping individuals and families access their relational competencies as an important part of prevention, as well as the resolution of their cur - rent difficulties. Spirituality: This program sees spirituality as central to wholeness and healing. Students are encouraged to integrate their practices of faith with their professional work. The program places strong emphasis on active demonstration of moral and ethical principles as exemplified by, but not limited to, Judeo-Christian teachings. Worldwide focus: The mission of the program reaches beyond the local and national community to the international community. This includes our collaboration with people from other nations and cultures to promote mutual understanding, resolve problems, and strengthen families.maritaL and f ami Ly thera Py\u2014Ph .d .

Prere QUisite A balance of course work in three liberal arts areas: Humanities (e.g., history, philosophy, literature, art, music, etc.) 20.0-24.0 English and Communication Skills (e.g., oral and written communication media, etc.) 9.0-13.0Natural and Social Sciences (e.g., mathematics, human biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, human development, ethnic studies, economics, political science or government, etc.) 24.0-32.0 Students not meeting the minimum number of units in any of the foregoing areas are required to complete additional course work prior to enrolling in the related M.S.W. degree classes. Please note: All prerequisite requirements must be completed before advancement to candidacy (prior to beginning the advanced curriculum). admission r eQUirements Following are the admission requirements for the Social Work Program: Applicants must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited university or college (official transcripts are evidence of courses completed). The department assesses the lib - eral arts preparation of each of its applicants in two areas: \u00b0the balance of course work, in three liberal arts areas, and \u00b0specific course work considered pre - paratory to the program's foundation (first year) courses (see also Liberal Arts Requirements in the M.S.W. Student Handbook). Applicants must submit a completed ap - plication\u2014including a personal statement, application fee, all college and/or university transcripts, and at least three letters of rec - ommendation (one from an academic source and one from a work supervisor). Applicants must meet the minimum aca - demic and professional compatibility criteria established by the program. Applicants must have a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 or above (on a 4.0 scale). Special consideration may be given to ap - plicants with grade-point averages as low as 2.85 if the last part of their college work shows significant improvement. Applicants whose cumulative grade-point average does 668 UNIVERSITY CATALOG not meet the minimum requirements stated above may receive further consideration for admission to the Social Work Program by providing a satisfactory GRE score, or two years of related employment and/or volun - teer experiences. Work and volunteer experi - ences must be verified by employer/supervi - sor statements on official agency stationery. Further consideration will also be given to individuals who provide evidence of ad - ditional certifications and/or training that illustrate commitment to a career in social work. Anyone who is admitted to the Social Work Program with a cumulative G.P .A. below 3.0 will be required to participate in individualized academic assessment and a targeted learning assistance program. Applicants must show evidence of profes - sional compatibility, personal qualifications, and motivation to complete a graduate program by obtaining a passing score on the admissions interview with the department's admissions committee. Evaluation criteria for the interview include: \u00b0verbal communication skills, \u00b0critical-thinking ability, \u00b0values congruent with the social work profession, \u00b0appreciation of human diversity, \u00b0evidence of reflective learning; and \u00b0comportment. No academic credit is given for life experience or previous work experience for any part for the Social Work Program. CUrriCULU m The 78-unit curriculum of the Social Work Pro - gram provides the mix of academic, experiential, and research experiences essential for M.S.W. de - gree students. Students must maintain a program grade-point average of 3.0 (or a letter grade of B on a 4.0 scale) and meet the knowledge, skills, and professional performance competencies outlined by the program. The minimum acceptable grade for required (core) courses is a B- (2.7). Grades in selective courses must be a minimum of a C (2.0). Courses with grades falling below the standards set for required and selective courses must be re - peated. Students are financially responsible for the cost of repeating courses in which grades obtained do not meet the minimum standards. genera L overvie W The program begins with the professional foun - dation content (first-year courses) common to all graduate social work education. Courses during the first year of study are divided into five profes - sional areas: human behavior in a cross-cultural environment, social welfare policy and services, practice theory and skills, social research, and field practicum. These five areas are strengthened by the integration of social work values and ethics, as well as knowledge of special populations (i.e., issues of gender, race, class, disability, and oppres - sion). The advanced curriculum of the program is divided into four subdivisions: 1. Conjoining curriculum and processes\u2014fur - ther integrating the foundational first year with the program's advanced curriculum; 2. Advanced curriculum nucleus\u2014includes course work common to all second-year students; 3. Core courses of the two concentrations\u2014clinical practice and policy, planning, and administration; and 4. Culminating curriculum and processes\u2014a capstone academic experience that facilitates the final stage of reflection and review in the development of the scholar-practitioner. Each of these four curricular subdivisions articulates through the progressive presentation and integration of knowledge, practice roles, and intervention modes to develop the depth and breadth of proficiency expected in advanced prac - tice within health and mental health. Program oP tions Alternate program options have been designed to address the varying needs of students. As such, the program offers a full-time, two-year option; a of transfers and Pra CtiCUm advan Ced s tanding for b .s .W . stUdents Students who have received a B.S.W. degree from a CSWE-accredited program within the past five years are supported in eliminating possible areas of redundancy in their education through (a) eli - gibility to transfer foundation course work and (b) consideration for practicum advanced standing. These additional options for B.S.W. students recognize the accomplishments in knowledge and skills that individuals receiving a baccalaureate degree from an accredited social work program possess. As such, students are not admitted into the M.S.W. degree program with pre-approval of course transfers or practicum advanced standing. Instead, once students are accepted into either the full-time or one of the part-time options, those students meeting the designated degree require - ments may apply for course transfers and evalua - tion of their practicum advanced standing. Receipt of course transfers and evaluation of practice maturity are treated as separate processes, as de - scribed below. Students should contact the depart - ment for more information. transfer s tUdents Individuals transferring from other accredited M.S.W. degree programs may transfer units for di - dactic course work in accordance with University policy and program guidelines. Field practicum experiences are nontransferable. ProfessionaL Con Centrations in behaviora L heaLth The Social Work Program offers two concentra - tions for professional practice, which are the focus of the second-year study: clinical practice; and policy, planning, and administration. Clinical practice concentration The clinical practice concentration requires mas - tery of advanced practice roles, modalities of inter - vention, and methods used in clinical social work. Study is required regarding the integration of advanced practice theories, diagnostic assessment, problem-solving skills and techniques; as well as the impact of policy upon the availability of treat - ment, treatment modalities, and expectation of outcomes. Students' experiences and knowledge are expanded through the selection of practicum sites and selectives. Policy, planning, and administration concentration The policy, planning, and administration con - centration represents a specialized study designed to prepare students for administrative roles in behavioral health organizations and institutions. As such, this concentration focuses on giving students understanding and skills in establishing and maintaining systems of care to assist individ - uals, families, and groups managing health and illness in context of the life cycle, promoting social change in public systems of care, policy analysis, program planning and implementation, program evaluation, and human resources management. Students' experiences and knowledge are expand - ed through the selection of practicum sites and selectives. CentraL aC ademi C ProC Cognates Professional practica Professional practica experiences (field practica) are regarded as an integral part of the Social Work Program because these offer students oppor - tunities to integrate and apply theoretical and research knowledge with social work practice and intervention skills in institutional or agency settings. Practica are designed (and selected) to provide maximum learning opportunities under the supervision of a qualified field instructor. As such, experiences are patterned to build upon one another\u2014presenting the increasing chal - lenges present in the continuum of generalist to advanced social work practice. Students complete 1,080 hours of field work in a qualified setting and 120 hours of concurrent integrated seminar for a total of 1,200 hours. The emphasis of SOWK 757A,B,C Professional 670 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Foundation Practicum and Seminar (480 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar) is on achiev - ing generalist social work knowledge, values, and skills\u2014including developing rapport with agency personnel and clients, acquiring interviewing skills, and obtaining beginning-level psychoso - cial assessment and intervention capabilities. The content of the concurrent seminar further sup - ports this perspective as it provides students with opportunities to integrate their practicum experi - ences with their developing professional identity. The emphasis of SOWK 787A,B,C Advanced Professional Practicum and Seminar (600 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar) reflects students' choice of concentration and provides the depth and breadth of learning opportuni - ties that underpin the acquisition of advanced practice capabilities. More specifically, advanced professional practica experiences are expected to promote increased insight and understanding of agency and/or client systems as these build on the professional foundation skills achieved during the first year of study. research The program includes completion of course work in applied research. An individually authored thesis option is available for students meeting program criteria. These study options aim to develop knowledge for the advancement of social work practice and provide guided experiences in the conduct of research applicable to a variety of professional and academic settings. Guidelines for these options are provided by the program. ProfessionaL ProC esses and Cognates Three academic review processes take place during the first year of the Social Work Program. These are: 1. M.S.W. degree advancement G.P .A. The M.S.W. degree advancement G.P .A. provides an initial predictor used for gate - keeping. The first 12 units completed to - wards the M.S.W. degree, including units acquired during nonmatriculation, must be completed with a G.P .A. of 3.0. Students who fail to achieve at this level may be dismissed from school. Students receive orientation to the process and requirements of the M.S.W. degree advancement G.P .A. during the stu - dent orientation conducted prior to the Fall Quarter. 2. Qualifying review When all foundation course work is com - pleted, students are required to pass the program's qualifying review. The intent of this process is to: assist faculty and students in assessment of strengths and areas for improvement, provide feedback, foster an environment of self-evaluation, and encourage heightened participation in individualized academic development. Ultimately, the results of this review help both the student and faculty to develop learning objectives for the concentration year. A specific orientation is held to explain the expectations, format, and scheduling of the qualifying review process. 3. Wholeness portfolio All students complete a wholeness portfolio during the professional practicum and semi - nar experience. This review of the student's individualized objectives and professional development begins during the first year of study and culminates during the second year of study as the student completes the final quarter of SOWK 787A,B,C. This experi - ence emphasizes the student's plans for em - ployment, life-long learning, and integration of the core values of Loma Linda University; and is seen as a capstone academic experi - ence that facilitates closure and the final stage of reflection and review in the develop - ment of the transitioning professional. dUaL d egrees Students interested in a dual degree with social work and gerontology or social work and criminal justice need to contact the Social Work Depart - ment directly.

The School of Science and Technology's De - partment of Social Work and Social Ecology is an interdisciplinary academic unit committed to the University's mission of human wholeness and to the belief that one's fullest development is achieved when all aspects of an individual's life are in balance. Both conceptually and pragmati - cally, the programs in the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology are guided by an over - arching ecological (bio-psycho-social-spiritual) perspective that employs scientific methods of problem analysis and program design. A key component in this framework is the importance of considering the relationships among behavioral, sociopolitical, economic, and environmental prob - lems. The result is an interdisciplinary teaching, learning, and practice environment designed to create interventions that will improve the func - tions of individuals, families, groups, organiza - tions, and communities.

The purpose of this certificate program is to provide general education that articulates com - munity service, mission electives, or short mis - sion trips in the United States and international settings. The certificate is consistent with WASC recommendations that baccalaureate programs actively foster an understanding of diversity and ensure breadth for all students in the areas of cultural, aesthetic, social, political, scientific, and technical knowledge expected of educated persons in this society. Course work in the certifi - cate enables the student to engage the population served at a deeper level than possible without skills in language and knowledge of Hispanic history, literature, and society. The theoretical, structured course in service learning provides a philosophical and theological basis for service, as well as an opportunity to reflect on and integrate the various components. The 27-unit Spanish Studies for Health Care Professionals is available to those who complete a minimum of 17 of the required 27-quarter units at Loma Linda University. For undergraduate students, the courses also contribute to meeting general education requirements. Courses include language (12 units); literature, history, and social sciences (4 units); diversity (4 units); and a service-learning course. For the certificate in Spanish studies, an immersion language and culture program is required, as well as an international or national service project with a Spanish-speaking population. The Christian-service course units are the two bookends of the certificate. The first units include a theoretical, theological, and philosophi - cal basis for service and provides the outline for the portfolio. In the second unit, the student completes the portfolio that integrates and sum - marizes the entire experience. Spanish-language proficiency at the high-ele - mentary or low-intermediate level or higher is re - quired and will be assessed by examination at the end of the certificate. Students may be required to take a proficiency examination for appropri - ate placement. All courses except the capstone portfolio course are currently available on cam - pus. For students concurrently enrolled in a Loma Linda University program, all courses may be transferred, except for RELR 404 Christian Service and RELE 429 Cultural Issues in Religion. Span - ish language, Spanish literature and history, and diversity courses must be taken for a letter grade, with a minimum G.P .A. of 2.0 for the certificate. This certificate program integrates three core val - ues of Loma Linda University to promote spiritual life and wholeness, diversity, and community ser - vice and global outreach.

Anthony J. ZuccarelliDean, Faculty of Graduate Studies Foundations of Graduate Study 681 Foundations of Graduate Study Recognizing the need to provide advanced edu - cation, the College of Medical Evangelists (CME) organized its School of Graduate Studies in 1954. The new school conferred a Ph.D. degree in 1958, the first Ph.D. to be awarded by a Seventh-day Adventist institution of higher education. In 1961 when CME became Loma Linda Uni - versity, the University assumed oversight of the graduate education conducted by La Sierra Col - lege in Riverside, California. By 1963, the School of Graduate Studies had been renamed the Graduate School\u2014with a home in a new building, named Frederick Griggs Hall in honor of a former depart - ment chair. The two campuses comprising Loma Linda University\u2014La Sierra and Loma Linda\u2014were separated in 1990. In 2005, the Graduate School was restructured as the Faculty of Graduate Studies. It continues to provide oversight of graduate programs, support - ed by other schools of the University; promotes and encourages independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication; and relates intellectual achieve - ments to the service of humankind. PhiLoso Phy In the Faculty of Graduate Studies of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meaning. Because this quest is served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their field of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by which knowledge is augmented. obJeCtives The Faculty of Graduate Studies attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communica - tion. 3. Relating intellectual achievement to the ser - vice of humankind. General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meet - ing all regulations pertinent to registration, ma - triculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school. The subject and unit requirements for admis - sion to individual professional programs are also outlined in this section. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all pro - grams (Section II). aPPL iCation and a dmissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admis - sions committees of the schools accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant quali - ties of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommen - dation of the program in which study is desired. sChoLarshi P Applicants are expected to present an under - graduate record with a grade-point average of B (3.0) or better in the overall program and in the field of the major. Some students with an overall grade-point average between 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades during the junior and senior years are superior or other evidence of capability 682 UNIVERSITY CATALOG is available. Foreign applicants are not eligible for provisional admission. from m aster's to Ph .d . degree bypassing master's degree A graduate student at this University may pro - ceed first to a master's degree program. If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the Doctor of Philosophy degree program, this intention should be declared even if the first objec - tive is to earn a master's degree. If after admission to the master's degree pro - gram a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree program, an application form should be submitted, along with letters of reference, to the dean(s) of the respective school(s). If the award of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before embark - ing on doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance commit - tee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that have been completed in the appropriate field, and that are of equivalent quality and scope, to his/her doctoral program.

The master's degree in health education is housed in the School of Public Health.dUaL degree The Master of Public Health degree in health education and the Master of Science in marital and family therapy degree program have many subject areas in common, specifically the emphasis on the systems approach to solving health and family problems. The area of prevention is also strongly emphasized in both degrees, as also are substance abuse, eating disorders, sexuality, and mental and physical health. The motto of Loma Linda University, \"To make man whole,\" can be greatly facilitated by the goals contained in the motto of the Counseling and Family Sciences Department's Marriage and Fam - ily Therapy Program: \"To make family whole.\" It is proposed that the joining of the two degree programs in a family health track will provide the student with the Christian counseling and health education skills needed to solve many of the world's physical and mental health problems. The marriage and family therapy major will also provide the option of a clinical license that will al - low the student who has completed the combined M.S./M.P .H. degree family health track to open up a private practice to increase his/her ability to provide services to the community. The M.P .H. degree in health education is a 58- unit degree program for health professionals. The M.S. degree in marriage and family therapy is a 66-unit degree. Jointly, there is a 14-unit crossover between the two degree programs and shared field or clinical training. A total of 124 units, or approximately nine quarters of full-time study, is needed to complete the combined M.P .H./M.S. degrees program. The combined degrees program contains sufficient HPRO courses to qualify the graduate to sit for the credentialing examination in health educa - tion. The program also contains 66 units of MFAM courses, which prepares the student didactically for the state license as a marriage and family therapist (MFT). admission The applicant must be admitted to both degrees separately, with his/her stated goal of the dual degree. The Combined Degrees Programs of the University 697 An applicant who begins his/her program with an emphasis in public health needs to seek advise - ment from the director. An applicant who begins his/her program with marital and family course work should see the director of that program. For specific admission requirements to both pro - grams, applicants should consult the University Catalog. obJeCtives The joint program in health education with mari - tal and family therapy aims to: 1. Produce skilled professionals in health edu - cation and marital and family therapy in the family health track. 2. Expose the student to the currently available content material in the fields of public health education and marital and family therapy.3. Provide for supervised field and clinical training that will give the student the op - portunity to apply and integrate theoreti - cal knowledge toward the development of health education and clinical skills and competencies. 4. Provide activities for the student to develop personal maturity as a professional who identifies with the preventive and curative aspects of health education and marital and family therapy. This dual degree (M.P .H./M.S.) will provide a ba - sis for doctoral work in mental and public health, and superior students will be encouraged to ex - plore possibilities for further graduate studies. m .P .h .

SIROJ SORAJJAKOOL, Program Director, Clinical Ministry MARY E. MOLINE, Program Director, Counseling and Family Sciences faCUL ty The faculty for the combined degrees program in Clinical Ministry with Marital and Family Therapy is drawn from the School of Religion and from the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences in the School of Science and Technology. the P rogram The combined degrees programs, Master of Arts in clinical ministry and Master of Science in marital and family therapy degree programs have many common subject areas, such as the spiritual and clinical emphasis in caring for the whole person. The joining of the two degree programs provides the student with the added Christian clinical counseling skills needed to minister to many spiritual and mental health problems. The marital and family therapy degree program also prepares the student for a clinical license. Li - censure allows the student in the M.A./M.S. com - bined degrees program more options for practice, including private practice. The student's ability to provide more services to the community\u2014in ad - dition to the traditional areas of practice, such as hospitals, churches, and schools\u2014is increased.obJeCtives The combined degrees program in clinical ministry with marital and family therapy has the following objectives: 1. Students will gain clinical skills related to the field of spiritual care and marriage and family therapy that will enable them to be - come competent practitioners. 2. Students will learn to integrate theoretical, theological, biblical, and philosophical foun - dations pertaining to the study of spiritual - ity and marriage and family therapy. 3. Students will be able to identify spiritual issues within the context of marital relations and health care and offer spiritual interven - tions. 4. Students will be knowledgeable of the legal and ethical standards relevant to the fields of chaplaincy and marital and family therapy and apply their knowledge to their clinical practice. The family clinical ministry track provides the basis for doctoral work in mental health and reli - gious studies. Outstanding students are encour - aged to explore possibilities for further studies. admission Applicants will need to apply to both programs separately, be accepted to both programs sepa - rately, and follow their admission requirements in order to qualify for the combined degree. (See the Catalog for specific instructions). Students can start the combined degrees program either by tak - ing marital and family therapy courses their first year or taking clinical ministries courses their first year. CLiniCaL PL aCements Students taking case presentation in MFAM will be placed in secular sites. Students taking course work in Clinical Ministries but are continuing their case presentation in MFAM will be placed in a Christian-oriented site, such as the Christian Counseling Center.

The combined degrees program in social work and public health reaffirms the heritage of these two professions working together. Simultaneously, it addresses the requisite knowledge and skills increasingly needed by professionals working in maternal and child health in low-income com - munities. As such, the curricula of the M.P .H. and M.S.W. in maternal and child health degree programs have been merged to offer a combined degrees program with both depth and breadth to address the myriad of intervention and commu - nity issues affecting this population. Combined degrees students must meet all the requirements of each of the participating pro - grams. If completed separately, the M.P .H. degree is 58 units and the M.S.W. degree is 78 units\u2014for a total of 130 units. In this combined degrees option, 24 units of the 130 units are counted by both the M.S.W. and M.P .H. degrees programs; this reciprocity reduces the total number of units required. Interested students should obtain from the department a curriculum plan showing the in - tegration of the M.P .H. degree and M.S.W. degree programs.medical s cientist\u2014 sm (m .d . with Ph .d .) The program is designed to attract students who are energized by doing research and want to con - tribute substantially to this enterprise. Students enter this combined degrees program through the IBGS (Integrated Biomedical Gradu - ate Studies) graduate programs (Anatomy, Bio - chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Pharmacology and Physiology). In the first year, students participate in a scientifically integrated program that includes biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, and anato - my. While in the first year, students also rotate through the laboratories of selected faculty mem - bers. In the second year, students increase their in - volvement in individual laboratory projects while continuing to complete graduate course require - ments. Students in selected areas may also be asked to serve as teaching assistants for graduate or medical classes. Students pursuing the com - bined degrees may also be involved with joint basic science and clinical meetings and confer - ences with the aim of understanding the interre - lationships between laboratory-based and clinical research. Upon demonstration of laboratory success, as indicated by completion of a first-author manu - script, the student will continue on to the tradi - tional first two years of the medical school cur - riculum. It is anticipated that the amount of time required to demonstrate laboratory success will be two to three years. Successful students who have acquired essential laboratory skills should con - tinue their affiliation with the host laboratory and continue research progress as time permits while in the medical school curriculum. Upon successful completion of the first two years of the medical curriculum and Step 1 of the USMLE examination, students will begin a series of rotations between the clinical sciences and the research laboratory. During these later years, students will complete all the standard clinical rotations and continue progress on laboratory projects. It is the intent of this program that stu - dents will acquire the requisite skills needed for 706 UNIVERSITY CATALOG a successful career at the interface of laboratory- based and clinical research. Program admission Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitive and requires evidence that the student is likely to develop into a successful medi - cal scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements for each of these programs. The application package for the Ph.D. degree program requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination. Both programs must accept a student before he or she is admitted to the Medical Scientist Pro - gram. Students entering the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program who determine that a research career is inappropriate may elect to complete the M.D. degree program independently. Students entering the Ph.D. degree program who desire a career in academic medicine may choose to apply for admission to the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program at a point after their entry into the Ph.D. degree program; however, the standard medical school application process will be required at that point.
