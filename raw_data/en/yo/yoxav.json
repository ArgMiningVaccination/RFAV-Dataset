The program is group-based (approximately 10-15 participants). It emphasizes learning ways to stay present, acceptance, and taking control of your mind, instead of letting thoughts run away with you. Participants practice these skills through in-session exercises, such as guided meditation and gentle movement activities. The program involves 4 weekly sessions of about 2 hours each. The program is free, and parking validation is provided.
