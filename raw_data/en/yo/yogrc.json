Riverbirch Holistic Health is a naturopathic practice that provides comprehensive holistic and alternative care to those of all ages and with all health concerns. Dr. Drains brings her unique set of strengths and talents and works whole-heartedly with clients to clear the path for healing. Through this working relationship, our clients grow in health and happiness by enjoying more of what is serving them and discarding what isn't. At Riverbirch Holistic Health, we believe that your body has the innate ability to heal itself. Our alternative healing approach, founded on the principles of naturopathic medicine, is to support and restore these inherent systems of healing when they have broken down - allowing your body to return to \"true health.\" We believe that naturopathic, client centered care is the cornerstone of any comprehensive and holistic health program. When your body works the way nature intended, your spirit soars--and so do you. Everyone in our office, from our receptionist to your Naturopathic doctor, has one goal in mind--to help you feel better. We know that when your body isn't in top shape that your entire outlook on life can be affected. That's why you'll always be greeted with a smile here and leave with an even bigger one on your face.
