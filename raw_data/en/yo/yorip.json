Fevers, chills, headache, soreness at the injection site, you can get really, really tired. These are all normal signs that your body is building protection. They should go away in a few days. To reduce the pain and discomfort where you got the shot, you want to apply a clean, cool, wet towel over the area, or kind of use or exercise your arm to reduce that discomfort. If you have fever, drink plenty of fluids, dress lightly and take a pain or fever-reducing medication. It's going to take about two weeks before the vaccine develops a maximum immunity in your body. Finally, be sure you're continuing to use preventive measures, like wearing your mask, washing your hands and social distancing to decrease your chance of spreading the virus if you're exposed to it.
