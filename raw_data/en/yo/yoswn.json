The word 'Aquamar' is a combination of Latin roots meaning 'water' and 'sea', an acknowledgement of the healing and life-giving essence of water as well as the connection to the sea that is manifest in the Oceania Cruises experience. The mandala symbol signifies wholeness, representing the world that is both beyond and within our minds and bodies. Its symmetry and infinite lines convey the importance of a holistic approach to wellness, incorporating all the elements of a healthy lifestyle that Aquamar was designed to encourage and support.5 6 7IMMERSE YOURSELF IN WELLNESS Begin your spa journey in the aromatic steam room, thalassotherapy pool or whirlpool to experience the healing benefits, detoxifying effects and tension-relieving powers of these timeless thermal environments.
