But certain health conditions can cause pH imbalances, which make it difficult for your body to function as it should. Sometimes, factors as simple as intense exercise or dehydration can lead to temporary pH imbalances. In other cases, pH imbalances can be caused by chronic conditions such as kidney failure. No matter the cause, pH imbalances can lead to symptoms such as confusion, headaches, and vomiting. Often, treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause. The pH scale is a way of describing whether something is acidic, neutral, or alkaline. In your body, a specific balance of acid to alkaline, or pH balance, is needed. The pH balance of substances such as your bodily fluids and organs can affect your digestion, hormones, metabolism, and overall body function. When your body is healthy, it maintains pH balance on its own. Most of this balancing takes place in your [kidneys](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/305488), which filter acids and bases. Any acids or bases your body doesn't need then leave your body in your urine. But certain factors and health conditions can cause pH imbalances, which can make it difficult for your body to function as it should. [Acidosis](/health/acidosis) occurs when your body cannot remove acid from your airways, your blood, or other body fluids. There are a few types of acidosis: - Lactic acidosis: [Lactic acidosis](/health/lactic-acidosis)is a type of metabolic acidosis. It happens when too much lactic acid builds up in your blood. - Diabetic acidosis: This type of metabolic acidosis happens when too many ketone acids build up in your blood. - Renal tubular acidosis: This type of metabolic acidosis occurs when your kidneys let too much acid back into your blood. - Hyperchloremic acidosis: This type of metabolic acidosis happens when the level of sodium bicarbonate, an alkaline, in your blood becomes too low. - Respiratory acidosis: [Respiratory acidosis](/health/respiratory-acidosis)occurs when your lungs don't expel enough carbon dioxide. [Alkalosis](/health/alkalosis) occurs when your body is too alkaline. There are a few types of alkalosis, including: - Metabolic alkalosis: This happens when there is too much of a chemical called bicarbonate in your blood. - Respiratory alkalosis: This happens when there is not enough carbon dioxide in your body. The symptoms of a pH imbalance depend on the type of imbalance you're experiencing. Symptoms differ between metabolic and respiratory pH imbalances and between acidosis and alkalosis. Common symptoms of major types are listed below. Metabolic acidosis symptoms: Respiratory acidosis Metabolic alkalosis symptoms: - confusion - fatigue [headache](/health/headache) - nausea - vomiting [loss of appetite](text=You%20may%20have%20a%20reduced,appetite%20or%20loss%20of%20appetite.) - rapid heartbeat [heart palpitations](/health/heart-palpitations) Respiratory [shortness fatigue [muscle spasms](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15466-muscle-spasms) - confusion - sleepiness The cause of a pH imbalance depends on the type of pH imbalance. For instance, diabetic acidosis is caused by a buildup of ketone bodies, and hyperchloremic acidosis occurs when your body doesn't have enough sodium bicarbonate. Causes of other common pH imbalances are listed below. Causes of lactic acidosis: - certain medications [low blood sugar](/health/low-blood-sugar-effects-on-body) - excessive exercise [heavy alcohol respiratory acidosis: [obesity](/health/obesity) - high altitude - lack of oxygen [lung disease](/health/understanding-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/chronic-lung-diseases-causes-and-risk-factors) [pneumonia](/health/pneumonia) - chronic airway diseases such as [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)](/health/copd) - chest injuries or abnormalities - overuse of sedatives [sleep apnea](/health/sleep/obstructive-sleep-apnea) Causes of respiratory alkalosis: [fever](/health/fever) - lung disease - lack of oxygen - high altitude - liver diseases - salicylate poisoning Anyone can get a pH imbalance from simple factors such as exercise or high elevation. However, the following risk factors increase your chances of developing a pH imbalance: - type 1 [diabetes](/health/diabetes) - kidney conditions - liver conditions - respiratory and lung conditions - obesity - epilepsy - heavy alcohol use It's a good idea to make a medical appointment if you suspect you have a pH imbalance. A doctor can diagnose the imbalance and can begin treatment. Tests to confirm a diagnosis might include: - Atrial blood gas: [This blood test](/health/urine-ph)determines the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. - Metabolic panel: A [metabolic panel](/health/basic-metabolic-panel)can check the levels of proteins, fats, and other substances in your blood. It's a good way to test kidney function. - Glucose test: If you have diabetes, you'll likely have a glucose test. - Urinalysis: A [urinalysis](/health/urinalysis)can check the proportion of acids being eliminated in your urine. - Urine pH: This [test](/health/urine-ph)will measure the acidity and alkalinity of your urine. Treatments will depend on the type of pH imbalance you have and its cause. For instance, insulin is the primary treatment for diabetic acidosis, but acidosis that is caused by kidney dysfunction, such as lactic acidosis or renal tubular acidosis, might be a sign that you need to begin dialysis treatments. Often, treating the pH imbalance involves treating the underlying condition. Examples of this include: - using medications to treat COPD or other chronic respiratory conditions - using [continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)](/health/nasal-cpap)or [bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)](/health/what-is-a-bipap-machine)to improve breathing - being placed on a [ventilator](/health/ventilator)if you cannot breathe on your own - treating a fever with appropriate medications - drinking electrolyte solutions to address dehydration - changing medications or starting new medications Your exact outlook will depend on the type of pH imbalance you have and its cause. For many people, treatment can restore pH balance. However, some pH issues are chronic or caused by chronic conditions. In these cases, you might need to take a new medication or take other steps to manage your pH in the long term. Your pH balance is an important part of keeping your body functioning well. When your body becomes too acidic (as in acidosis) or too alkaline (as in alkalosis), it can lead to symptoms that make it difficult to manage everyday activities. The exact symptoms will depend on the type of pH imbalance but can include sleepiness, fatigue, headache, loss of appetite, confusion, and vomiting. Treatment for a pH imbalance depends on the type and the cause. Treatment plans typically focus on addressing the underlying cause. Often, once the underlying cause is treated or better managed, the pH imbalance will resolve. "}
