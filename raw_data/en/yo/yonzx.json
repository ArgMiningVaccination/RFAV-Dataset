One of the real treats instore for y ou, and whichis even now being arranged, is spinographical lectures (stereopticon and otherwise) and spinographical demonstrations. To the Chiropractic profession, it is a much discussed question as to whethe r there is or is not a scientific value in purchasing an outfit and learning how to use it. \"Dr. B.J.\" has installed in The P.S.C. the finest equipment possible. More money could not ge t better. His negatives are being made up into lantern slides weekly . Lectures will be delivered at the convention proving subluxations , bent processes, etc. To all Chiroprctors inclined to desire to put in an outfit, special classes will be form ed and lectures given on the mechanism and how to use it. Thus you can start in right. No charges will be m ade for these lectures. Cuts will appear from time to tim e, between now an then, in the pages of The Ch iropractor . Spinography (skiagraphs of the spine) have been little worked out. It is an art for which m edical m en have had little use. Its technique rem ained practically unsol ved until our Dr. B.J. got hold of it. Even now, altho only installed tw o months ago, several authorities have visited The P.S.C. and examined our negatives and call them \"masterpieces.\" Of this we can be m odestly proud. W e propose to lay wide to The U. C.A. convention al this research and give you the benefit of it. One day will be set aside, the m achine transported to the convention hall a nd be in working order, negatives made, developed, shown, etc. Learn spinography of one who has developed its scientific qualities. We are endorsing the value of this work and as tim e proceeds we will endorse it m ore, therefore, if The P.S.C. can endorse this for our clinical value, y ou can do the same providing your business and its finance permits. It is an expensive adjunct and no Chiropractor must have it, but it is well if y ou can. It never does harm to know something about this work even tho y ou cannot afford to buy one. This is one of the ne w attractions offered for this y ear. 1916 (July 15): FHN [A.C. 21][5(22):2] notes: IT SPE AKS FOR IT SELF On May 1st, we announced that the spinographic and X-ray work had been divorced from the regular P.S.C. courses. It will continue to be supplied to all students who enrolled BEFORE May 1st, 1916. AFTER May 1st, this course was a separate one and cost $25. At that time we enrolled 5 students, vi z: Drs. Markwe ll, Lyman, Post, Buck and Mrs.. Thomas. The $25 rate continued until July 1st, at which tim e it was raised to $50.00. To take advantage of the raise some 55 students enrolled at the $25 rate, thus saving $25. Those who enrolled previous to July 1st, 1916 are:- 1. A.J. Larson, Ludington, Mich. 2. Ruth A shworth, P .S.C...... 8. Carl S . Cleveland, P .S.C...... 43.

(who w ill later report the first 14X36 full-spine, w eight-bearing X-ray s) writes letter to BJ on 9/6/24; Sausser reports on Neurocalometer Users Only \": Medical doctors have said, ' DEMONS TRATE to us y our theory that subluxations in the spine casue PRESSURE upon nerves, and that by replacing those subluxated vertebrae to normal positions, you release pressure upon nerves, and we will believe.' They said it couldn' t be done - and time only seemed to prove them right as far as actually demonstrating the fact. The only demonstration we could offer was that people got well when we replaced the s ubluxation, but we could not actually demonstrate th at we released pressure upon the nerves. But two men never gave up the fight. After 20 y ears of intensive research work, Dr. P almer has perfected an ins trument which DOES prove the above point - and goes wa y on bey ond that. It proved so many things that it was no wonder that small group of chiropractors were enthusiastic. It proves pressure upon nerves. It proves the exact spot where that pres sure is. It m easures the exact degree of pres sure at that point. AND - it does more. It checks imme diately after an adjustment whether a proper adjustment was gi ven, by registering whether the pressure was removed fromt he nerves. Can y ou see what that m eans?.... Experimental work on approxima tely a thousand cases had proven there are man y subluxation s in the spine which the X-Ray d oes not locate , causing pressure upon nerves. This instrument locates them. Experimental work also show s that by using the instrument as a check, res ults can be obtained in from one-fourth to on-half the time now necessary under the present met hod. In other words, should it take 100 adjustments to get a case well now, it would take only from Notes on the History of X-ray in Chiropractic Keating 5 25 to 50 to get the same case well using the new NEUROCALOMETER 1924 (Nov 22): Fountain Head News [14(9)] notes: -(p. 2): In the past we have taken it all for granted that when we gave an 'adjustment,' that 'if the bone cracked,' or 'it moved,' then the pressure WAS removed. We have believed that when we 'adjusted' it based on PALPATION OR THE SPINOGRAPH , that that automatically released the pressure upon the nerv es, restored the flow, and the patient SHOULD AND WOULD get well. BUT ;when he didn't, we were up the stump. The Neurocalometer has proven to us that thousands of 'subluxations' have been 'adjusted' for weeks and months and no pressures were released, nor were interferences removed, nor were transmissions restored. We were just 'cracking backs' or 'moving bones.' The Neurocalometer is CHECKING CHIROPRACTORS THIS HIT-AND-MISS SYSTEM. -BJ Palmer notes reaction to neurocalometer: (p. 3) TIMES CHANGE MEN How well and vividly do I remember, a few years back, when the X-ray was introduced to detect the correct POSITION of vertebrae, both normal and abnormal, in alignment and in subluxations. The field split on the question. A few saw its value and began to take it up at once. Some of THE FIELD held off and waited \"to see.\" Today - some 13 years later - it is an accepted form of technique by the entire field. Few chiropractors but what are for it. The schools split. On one side - THE PSC . On the other side - ALL OTHER schools. Loban became bitterly opposed, and wrote much against this 'form of mixing.' Forster wrote much and said much more against its use. Other schools took much the same attitude, all trying to stem the tide of the new movement, not because the movement was wrong, BUT BECAUSE ONE B.J. PALMER ADVOCATED IT. Today - some 13 years later - Loban writes for Spinography , teaches it, uses it, advocates it. Today - some 13 years later - Forster puts it first in value to detect subluxations. Now comes the Neurocalometer idea. Loban is neither for nor forninst, he is riding both waves, ready to jump either way that proves to be the most popular. Forster will come too on this the same as they did on Spinography . They move upward only as the field forces them to come in. Times certainly do change men, but with some it takes a long, long time! 1925 (Apr/May): Bulletin of the ACA [2(3-4)] notes: -Editor notes LA Nash DC's training (p. 11): LA Nash DC, graduated from the Palmer School of Chiropractic in 1914 and practiced his profession in Carthage NY up to the entrance of the United States into the World War when he enlisted in the Medical Department of the United States Army . After a thorough training in X-ray technic in the Army Medical School, and Laboratory training cour ses in two hospitals, Dr Nash was placed in charge of the X-ray Laboratory in one of the army's largest general hospitals and continued in this capacity throughout the war. Dr Nash's experience included every known phase of X-ray work. He acted as X-ray technician for many of the leading Roentgenologists of the United States. After completing active Army service Dr Nash attended the National Post-Graduate School at Chi cago and is now in charge of a Chiropractic X-ray Laboratory in Syracuse NY... 1925 (July-Aug): Bulletin of the ACA [2(6-7)] notes: -reprinted from the Davenport Daily Times , Tuesday, July 28, 1925, a report that EA Thompson DC, PSC faculty member will resign effective Oc tober 1, 1925 to operate X-ray laboratory in Baltimore (p. 15) 1925 (Sept): Bulletin of the ACA [2(8)] notes: -LA \" -EA Thompson DC \"is now conducting an X-ray Laboratory in the city of Baltimore\" (p. 9) 1926 (Jan 12): Opinion of Judge in trial of Warren L.

(1975): In 1927 when I joined the College I found it fully serviceable in all respects. It was then privatel y owned and consisted of a sturdy three-story frame building on Venice Boulevard. A large auditorium occupied the top floor while the second floor contained a dissection laboratory and a number of smalle r clinic suites. The X-ray Laboratory, Chemical Laboratory, cl ass rooms, stock rooms, and the main office were all on the first floor. In fact, it was built specifically to serve and fulfill the needs of a Chiropractic College as they then existed. Upon my graduation in 1929, I was invited to join the Faculty. That was the beginning of a long and happy association with our College. 1928 (May 26): JAMA [90(21):1733-8] notes: LOS ANGELES COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC (Inspected, Oct. 5, 1927) This school is located at 918 West Venice Boulevard (West Sixteenth Street). It began in December, 1924, with the amalgamation of three schools: the Golden State College of Chiropractic , the Eclectic College of Chiropractic , and a small, struggling Los Angeles chiropractic college conducted for years by Charles A. Cale but seemingly taken over by his wife, Linnie A. Cale, at the time of their separation; Li nnie A. Cale is now dean of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic , and Charles A. is running a school bearing his own name. Building . - The schools owns a three-story building, all of which it occupies. Space is ample, but the arrangement is poor. The roentgen-ray department is given the most conspicuous place, on the first floor. Dr. CH Wood, the presid ent, has his private offices in the front rooms of the second floor; a ll of his equipment, however, is used by the school. The assembly hall is on the third floor. Equipment . - This is the best equipped chiropractic school that the inspector has seen . There were said to be forty new adjusting tables, and several of these were seen. There were said to be twenty therapeutic lights, four of which were of the large Fischer type. Four Morse wave generators were men tioned. There were patients in almost every booth, and to insist on seeing this apparatus would have been embarrassing. However, it is the policy of the president to sell all old apparatus about every tw o years and purchase new. He probably acts as advertising agent for the manufacturers and purchases at a very low cost. Th e statement is made that about $11,000 worth of new equipment has been purchased within the past ten months, and the statement may not be grossly exaggerated. A new $85 adjusting table was given as a premium to every new student enrolling this summer; this was done as a \"substitute for a cut in tuition,\" but such a measure, togeth er with the rapid change of its physical therapy apparatus, makes th e school an agency for the sale of equipment - an objectionable feature in spite of the fact that it provides better equipment for the us e of the students. There were said to be eight microscopes. The chemistry laboratory was small and meagerly equipped. The school offers a 'course' in 'urinalysis.' Faculty. - There are eight teachers, one of whom (the dean) is an osteopath; the others claim only chiropractic education. Notes on the History of X-ray in Chiropractic Keating 6 Students . - The present enrollment is said to be 225 . One hundred of these are in the night class. The graduates last year numbered ninety. The year before there were 115 . Requirements . - The state law demands of chiropractors petitioning for examination a high school diploma or its equivalent. The state's field agent, to whom th e inspector talked, asserts that Dr. Winters, who grants the qualifying cer tificates, is a graduate of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic. It was learned in San Francisco that the students in the Berkeley Chiropractic College send applications not to San Francisco but to Los Angeles , because it is much easier to get qualifying certificates from Los Angeles. Course . - The time required for the da y course is eighteen months and for the evening course is th irty-six months. The schedule includes 3,600 hours - probably forty -five minute periods. Of this time, 200 hours are said to be given to dissection, and 100 each to roentgen-ray and minor surgery. Obstetrics and pediatrics are also taught, but all courses are included under the name of chiropractic, this being an all-inclusive name in California. The tuition is $750 cash or $850 in time payments ; this price includes at present an $85 adjusting table as a premium. (Schools, 1928) 1928 (July): Chirogram: -Harold H.

Evidence was introduced that there was a discrepancy in the statements of professional education sworn to in the application for licensure offered to the Medical Board in Colorado, the Osteopathic Board in California and the Chiropractic Board in California, and evidence showing Dr. Fortin's sworn statemen ts of his professional education and his period of practice in Calif ornia since his advent here in 1919...

In the fall of 1918 Dr. Weiant was a member of the Chemical Warfare Division of Students' Army Training Corps, stationed at Cornell University, at that time taking special work in physical and organic chemistry and in chemical microscopy. In 1919 he was Science teacher at Westchester Military Academy, Peekskill , New York. Graduated in 1921 from the Palmer School of Chiropractic , and received his Ph.C. degree from the Texas Chiropractic College in 1922. He was professor of Chemistry and Gynecology in the Texas Chiropractic College for serveral years up to 1925. Dr. Weiant practiced Chiropractic in Mexico in 1925 and 1926, during which time he adjusted President Calles. He lectured at the Mexican School of Chiropractic, Mexico City, during the summer of 1925, and attended physiology lect ures of Gley (discoverer of parathyroid glands) given at the University of Mexico. Dr. Weiant has since January, 1927, been Professor of Chemistry and Physiology at the Eastern Chiropractic Institute . He has had one year's practical experience in spinography at the Eastern X-ray Laboratory, Newark, NJ. He is Chemist and co-founder of the Eastern Chemical Laboratory, which, since 1927, has made over 4,000 urine analyses with Chiropractic interpretation. Dr. Weiant is co-inventor with Philip O. Gravelle, fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society, of the Analyte , an apparatus for the study of hyperemia associated with subluxations. He is the author of a Notes on the History of X-ray in Chiropractic Keating 7 number of scientific Chiropractic articles, including the 'Verdict of Science.' He was formerly editor of The Chiropractic Digest . He is a contributor to The Mexican Magazine; a member of the New York Microscopical Society, a charter member of the American Spinographic Society, an official lecturer for the New York State Chiropractic Society in its winter education program... -The Chiropractic Digest is published by TCC 1930 (Jan/\"N.D.J.\"): -Advertisement for \"Modified Radio-Activity as a Supplement to Chiropractic Treatments: Modified radio-activity provides a force that is entirely different in its effect from the action of pure Radium in its usual form.

The object of the Council is to be \"To establish better co-ordination between Chiropractic organizations, schools and laboratories for the purpose of cooperating and endeavoring to federate for counsel to advance the interests of Chiropractic in the State of New York.\" The Constitution and By-laws were adopted and permanent officers elected December 2, 1932, at the Hotel New Yorker.

The X-Ray verification of this procedure require s the up-right work also. It was this contact that finally decided that the only proper technique for spine work would be the one that would enble the operator to take the entire spine on one film in one expos ure and to have the film wide enough to take in the entire pelvis and also to get the entire degree of curvature in an extreme rotatory sco liosis. This latter reason so as to be able to amke comparisons as the corrective work was applied. The 8\" film was very impractical fo r curvatures. The two-exposure procedure was also impractical.... Only a few persons who were closely associated were informed of the new technique that was being worked out. It was still uncertain as to whether the procedure would be successful. Finally the stage was set for the work, and the first 14x36 inch film that was taken was a success. Everything from the atlas down to and including four inches of the femur was plainly visible and easily interpreted. The work was put on display at one of our Basic Technique meetings and from then on the word was passed along until to-day so many requests have come in for the technique that it was decided to write this article in answer to all of them. 1933 (Oct): The Chiropractic Journal (NCA) [1(10)] publishes: -\"New York School News,\" edited by H.

Sausser, President of the Board of Counselors of Spinogra phers and X-Ray Operators, who will present a course in Spinography to the Senior classes. Dr. Sausser is nationally known as a leading authority in his subject. 1934 (Dec 31): typed and hand-edited copy of news release (National College Special Collections; in my CINY files): Release on Sunday January 15th TO THE EDITOR: Appended herewith is an advance story on the Seventh annual meeting of the New York State Chiropractic Society . If there are any changes your paper will be communicated with. SYRACUSE, N.Y. Jan. 13 -- Tw o complet X-ray photographs of the anatomy of human beings, said to be the first ever developed in the history of therapeutic science, are featured at the semi-annual convention of the New York State Chiropractic Society which is in session here at the Hotel Syracuse. The pictures, which are full sized, each standing six feet in height, were made by Warren Sausser, leading Xray researcher, and show that the structure of the human body is such that the vertebrae of the spine act as supports for the nerves that radiate from the spinal cord and that these nerves pass through the space between the verteb rae. The purpose of the X-ray photographs, according to S. Goldschmidt, President of the New York State Chiropractic Society , is to demonstrate the contention of the chiorpractic school of mechano-th erapeutics that when there is the least subluxation or misalignment of these spaces impingement upon the nerve branches causes irritation and interfere nce with the normal functioning of the human system resu lting in pain and disease. The convention, attended by 300 chiropract ors from all over the state, was welcomed by Mayor Marvin of this city and other officials and was addressed, among others, by Dr. Ruland W. Lee, President of the National Chiropractic Ass'n. One hundred million people in the United States may legally receive chiropractic treatment and are safeguarded in such treatments by the laws of forty-two states, of the District of Columbia and Hawaii, where this form of mechano-therapeutic treatment is recognized by legislative enactment and qualified practitioners are licensed by state boards set up to regulate the practice, Dr. Lee stated during the course of his address. On the other hand, he declared, 27,000,000 people in this country are legally deprived of the opportunity of availing themselves of chiropractic treatment by the States of Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, new York and Texas, where the practice has not been legalized and brought under State control like the practice of medicine, or dentistry, optometry and even chiropody., Dr. Lee said. As a consequence, he added, large numbers of people in the mentioned states seeing such treatments are exposed to the dangers of serious injuries at the hands of unqualified chiropractors and quacks. Prosecution for practicing chiropractic in the states where it is unlicensed and therefore illegal, he pointed out, has been of little avail, the only effect being to humiliate and \"martyrize\" qualified practitioners who have fallen foul of the law in the states where chiropractic is not yet legally recognized. \"The Chiropractic movement is closely following the experiments of all scientific developments,\" Dr . Lee declared. \"Those of us who are being hounded by the authorities and our foes who are desperately endeavoring to monopolize the treatment of the sick in the few states which are still closed to us, may de rive comfort from the recollection of how Harvey was martyrized when he first announced his discovery that blood actually circulates through the human body; of how bitterly Pasteur's theory of innoculation against hydrophobia was assailed by the conservatives and reactionaries in the field of medicine; how Jenner was denounced as charlatan and trifler with human life when he began his innoculation of childre n against diptheria. Marconi was jeered at, but modern radio came despite his deriders. Fulton's steamboat was denounced as 'Fulton's Folly,' and the first locomotive was anathematized as a 'contraption of the devil.' Peruvian Bark was curing thousands of victims of mala rial and other fevers before the medical profession dignified it w ith a belated admission to its pharmacopea.\" Nevertheless, the fact that states like Maryland, Pennsylvania, Illinois, California and Wisconsin , where great medical schools are located had legally recognized chiropractic, which had also been legalized by the United States Congress for use in the District of Columbia, was proof of its increasing acceptance by the American people, Dr. Lee asserted, adding that in the states where the practice was still illegal, the principles of chiropractic have for years been accepted by leaders of the medical profession who, in increasing numbers, are employing chiropractors in their private practice or to give treatments to themselves and to members of their families. \"by what logic they seek to deny to others the benefits they extend to their own patients or to themselves, one must leave to our opponents to explain,\" he said. Dr. Lee quoted from numerous articles in leading medical journals by prominent physicians showing that relief of certain ailments is obtained through mechano-therapeutics which, in reality, are chiropractic, he added. One outstanding surgeon whom he quoted is Dr. James P. Warbasse, chief surgeon of the German (now Lenox Hill) Hospital in New York City and a member of the New York Academy of Medicine, who in his work on \"Surgical Treatment\" stated that a large category of peripheral nerve distrubances are due to subluxation, or misplacement of the vertebrae, and are relieved by chiropractic treatment. He also cited the experiments at Cornell University reported in 1926, by Dr. Henry P. DeForest of New York City and Dr. Horace G. Baldwin, of Tannersville, covering, during a period of three years, of some 3,000 cases including nervous pros of painful afflictions classed as \"rheumatic.\" by dissection, by study of the human skeleton, by actual experiment on living patients and by the aid of the X-Ray, Dr. Lee said, they delved into the connection between the sympathetic nervous system and the sacro-iliac joint. Their results, as reported in the New York Herald Tribune on May 24, 1926, in every case substantiated their theory that a slight dislocation of the dorsal bone of the pelvis exerts pressure on nerves passing through th e joint and may have deleterious consequences in the human body. Another medical authority quoted by Mr. Lee was Dr . G.H. Patchen , of New York City who, in an article in the Journal of the Notes on the History of X-ray in Chiropractic Keating 9 American Institute of Homeopathy , described vertebral adjustment as \"a therapeutic procedure founded upon the theory that pressure upon a spinal nerve by a displaced or subluxated vertebrae is the physical and perpetuating cause of 95 percent of all cas es of dis ease, the remaining 5% being due to subluxations of other skeletal segments. He quoted Dr. Patchen' s article to the effect that the reluctance of the m edical profes sion to accept this theory was due to an erroneous opinion concerning the limitation of vertebral movements and to confused ideas about the nature and cause of disease.\" Studies by Dr. John B. Carnett, Professor of Surgery in the Graduate School of Medicine, Univ ersity of Pennsy lvania, were stated by him, Dr. Lee said, have disclosed that the usual cause of pain and tenderness in the abdominal wall is an irritation of the spinal nerves where they made their exits through the vertebrae and that the commonest cause of this nerve irritation is bad body mechanics, Prof. Carnett wrote, cures the abdom inal pain and tenderness. Another medical authory involved by Dr. Lee in his address was Dr. Joel B. Goldthwait, of the Graduate School of Medicine of Harvard University , who, in a paper published in 1933 in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery said: \"The average surgeon does not understand back cases. The sam e is true of the average arthritic, or the paraly tic, or the average foot cases, which respond so easily if rightly handled...The endles s putting on of plas ter cas es or braces , of strapping feet or knees, without first correcting the mechanical features that are at fault, is purpos eless.\" Dr. Goldthwait urged, said Dr. Lee, that orthopedic surgeons, in addition to doing all that general medicine indicates should see to it that the body mechanics are such as to make health possible. If, Dr. Goldthwait said, the m embers of the surgical profession choose to do only operative work, some other specialty or school will take this over. Finally , Dr. Lee quoted the findings of the White House Conference Child Health and Protection, called by President Hoover in 1932. The subcom mittee of this conference on orthopedics and body mechanics, which was headed by Dr. Robert M. Osgood, made the following statement, among othe rs: \"Its impression from its own experience is very strong that the average general practtioner has been insufficiently inform ed and consequently not vitally interested in the details of body mechanics... This failure of appreciation is primarily due to a lack of training in the basic principles of body mechanics in the medical schools.\" S. Goldschmidt , president of the New York State Ch iropractic Society , who presided at the session, today said at the conclusion of Dr. Lee's addres s that chiropractic training revers es the training of the physician. The latter gets his practical training, he declared, after he begins his practice. As a matter of law, he pointed out, a license to practice medicine in this state m ay be is sued even before the candidate has served any internsh ip. \"The chiropractor gets his practical experience from the beginning,\" he pointed out. Mr. Goldschmidt stated to the convention that steps are now under way to secure the enactment of a law by the New York Legislature legalizing and regulating chiropractic. Under the proposed legislation licenses would be issued only to such persons as have been graduated from a resident school after a course of study over a period of not less than four successive school y ears. Admission to such a school w ould be limited to high school graduates. \"It is not our intention to have chiropractic encroach on the fields of general medicine or surgery ,\" he declared. \"On the contrary , we intend that the practice shall be limited strictly to the field of body mechanics . We do not hold chiropractic out as a panacea or 'cure all,' but we m aintain that it has a place in m edical science that should be recognized akin to dentistry . With that recognition will autom atically come the protection of the public against charlatans and quacks - just as the recognition and licensing of de ntists eliminated the dangers to the public from the barber who in addition to cutting one's hair added to his incom e by yanking out decay ed teeth.\" 1935 (F The Chiropra ctic Journa l (NCA) [4(2]] cover: Collinson WA.

Reese, D.C. 1607 North West 10th St. Oklahom a City , Okla. Doctor Reese:- Since I do not know just how y ou plan to use the \"biography \" you request in y our letter of Oct. 15th., the best I can do is give it to y ou and let y ou pick out the part that y ou want to use. Born April 24th, 1882 near Nassau, now Gibson, Iowa, of pioneer Yankee parents . Just ten m iles away was What Cheer, Iowa. A mining town, where one D.D. Palmer kept a grocery store and bought farm produce, and where one W illard Carver, being then a farm boy, hauled the farm produce and sold it to D.D. Palm er. Chiropractic resulted from the acquaintance thus form ed, for the two men discussed many things togeth er during the y ears. Later D.D. Palmer moved to Davenport and in time discovered Chiropractic. Willard Carver attended Drake University as a law student and becam e an attorney . My Mother's y oungest brother, \"Uncle Howard\" Nutting to all old time Palmer graduates, was a cl ose neighbor and lasting friend of the P almers. It was he who s pread the news to us on the farm that Chiropractic had been discovered a nd insisted upon my Mother being one of the first few patients. Willard Carver was called in as an attorney , when D.D. Palm er had his first legal trouble. He was cleared but lost his school. Then Uncle Howard, helped B.J. to get the school started on a sound financial plan but before they got all arrangem ents m ade, W illard Carver had started Carver College , having obtained a State Charter for it, making it the first Chartered school of Chiropractic in the world. Just over in Missouri a little way , the Osteopaths had established their College, so I often say that I was born in No Man's Land, of the Battle of Techniques. All the tim e I was growing up I heard m any heated argum ents on the com parative value of techniques and methods of practice and because I had been constantly under medical care up to the tim e I was twenty four years of age, continually getting worse with a kidney trouble, finally terminating in acute Bright's disease and the Medical man's final report to the family that I had less than twelve hours to live, I was naturally skeptical of all doctors and their methods. Dr. Willard cam e along, just in tim e, and started me on the road to recovery . When I was twenty six, in 1908, I began the study of Chiropractic at Carver College, graduated in 1909 but stay ed and studied, teaching in the clinic departm ent, all told five years. Began the development of \"The Postural Method of Chiropractic Diagnosis and Adjusting\" in the summer of 1911. Taught it to classes, mostly post graduate, while I was developing it. Finally presented it in its completed form in 1934 at the A nnual Kansas State Convention. Presented it first in a national way at the Annual National Chiropractic Association Convention, held that y ear, 1935 at Holly wood, California. Published the work in textbook form and copy righted it in 1938. Finding a fundamental basi c foundation, from which all Chiropractic, and other drugless tec hniques, could be harmonized, to simpl[if] y our method of practice, y et make it more uniformly resultful, has alway s been m y hobby . The Postural m ethod will do just that if the profession will study it, thru the m edium of two important phases of our work that has been almost entirely overlooked. Those two important things are \"motion\" and \"range of movem ent.\" W e cannot see \" motion,\" when we can \" see\" what we have alway s believed to be motion, what we actually see is \"range of movement.\" If we have in our body , from conception to maturity , \"constant normal motion,\" which can only be produced by a constant and uninterrupted out-flow of life-force, from the brain, to all parts of the body , then we will have perfect health, with all of the bodily functions working normally , including \"possible full range of normal movement,\" of every vertebrae, organ and part. In order to be normal, and this is where the doctors who diagnose by X Ray will becom e interested, every vertebra m ust have norm al range of movement, in three distinc tly different directions, combined. The X Ray \"sees\" in only one di rection and does not register movem ent at all and there is where the greatest part of our technique troubles have come from. It is my hope now, to interest X Ray men in an attempt to make their m achines picture the dis tortions , as they actually occur, which is by abnorm ality of range of movem ent. It will require entirely new X Ray technique and methods of taking pictures, for now they are taking only \"stills.\" If we can get them to accurately picture disturbance of range of m ovem ent, by intentionally picturing each of the six extrem es of range of each vertebra that is pictured, then the results will indeed m ake a house-cl eaning in the twenty thousand or more techniques, now in use. I am not fighting any body but I am sure boosting all I can for practical Chiropractic methods of practice and I am strong for discarding the many unnecessary , useless and dangerous techniques now in use. Let us go back and pick up the fundamentals we should have had forty years ago. The old threadbare story of the blind men who went out to \" see\" the elephant, applies to our profes sion as well now as it did forty years ago, but now we have the basic fundam entals of m otion and range of m ovem ent, that will serve to make each of the five blind m en, \"see\" the entire elephant at once. There is nothing to lose, all to gain.

Professional services are given free by more than 50 outstanding Doctors of Chiropractic in the Louisville area. They have given their spare tim e for m any weeks to help get the Center on its feet. The 255 members of the Ladies Lend-A-Hand Society have taken over many of the operational tasks. They have given their time generously and have contributed equipment in various way s. Two hundred dollars was given toward laboratory equipment, bucky and shield for X-ray room, draperies, sh eets, and kitchen supplies. These women have worked tirelessly in fund drives to help further the cause. The Center is already taxed to the lim it. A waiting list has been established for children who need health care. The only requirem ent for admittance is that the patient m ust be a child and m ust be in need of help. Care is free, and 90 children are receiving care at the Center now. More than 400 are on the waiting list. These 400 m ust wait until expanded facilities enable the Cent er to adm it them . All care is on outpatient basis, and several of the children must make long autom obile trips every week and sometimes twice a week for their Chiropractic care. Weekly conferences are held with the parents of the patients and daily reports are subm itted by parent s at the end of each week. These reports are carefully integrated with clinical statistics so that the doctors may decide precis ely what care is needed. At present the Center functions on Monday s and Thursday s. Every fifth Thurs day the staff doctors meet to correlate the records and the progress of patients. The unique operation of the clinic would fascinate even the experienced practitioner; sm oothness in fitting the y oung patients into the routine was outstanding. The thoroughness and personal interest with which each detail is emphasized is a tribute to the fine leaders hip and high caliber of the personnel. A visit to this Clinic is an inspiring experience, and to talk with the staff doctors gives one a feeling of great hope and courage for the profession as a whole. Active support and contributions to this Clinic will help speed the needed expansion and assist the research needed in furthering our professional aims and objectives. Additional equipment and services are required at Kentuckiana to ta ke advantage of added facilities already made available by the United S tates Governm ent. It was indeed a privilege for Mrs. Lill and m e to be afforded the opportunity of making this visit. We feel it a pleasure to be able to present to others our impressions of the Center. The worthwhile work being carried on here by these few will undoubtedly be of great value to many in the y ears to come, and should by all means encourage others to think seriously of contributing to the cause. The business management of this Center is conducted by a group of Louisville business and professi onal m en.

All material compiled will be used in conjunction with our under-graduate programs in X-ray and also presented at our graduate seminars. The school is requesting coope ration from the profession and suggesting that all chiropractors w ho have films denoting the above conditions donate these valuable plates to our Central X-ray Library. Many thousands of excellent roentgenographic specimens are currently occupying file space in offices throughout the country. These films could be put to excellent use in the best interest of our profession. Briefly, the X-ray Library will operate in this manner: Films donated by the Doctor of Chiropractic will be regarded as a loan. The custodian of the Library will be responsible for storage and maintenance of their property. Should the doctor wish to recall an X-ray that he has donated, it will be returned to him by registered mail immediately upon his request. A cer tificate indicating participation in this program will be issued to all doctors who cooperate. Each film will be appropriately identified indicating the donor's name and address.

Vampa DC is a \"certified chiropractic roentgenologist and Director, LA CC Outpatient Clinic X-ray Laboratory at 920 E Broadway , Glendale (Carlson, 1963) Governor Rock efeller Endorses Bill Governor Rockefeller, prior to pa ssage of chiropractic legislation, made public the following letter: The Honorable Joseph F. Carlino Speaker of the Assembly Assembly Chamber The Capitol Albany, New York Dear Speaker Carlino: My purpose in writing is to set forth the facts leading to my recommendation that the Peterson-Rules Committee Bill providing for the licensure of chiropractors be enacted. For many years, chiropractors in this state have been practicing without regulation, with restric tions, and without requirements for adequate training. Efforts by law enforcement officers to prevent their unlicensed practice have not been successful in the courts. Moreover, since New York State is one of the four states that do not license chiropractors, there is the real danger that the state has become a haven for those unqualified practitioners unable to obtain licenses in other states. Persons today seeking chiropractic treatment thus have no assurance that they are being treated by trained practitioners. In the fact of these persisting circumstances dangerous to the public health, I announced, at the end of last year's legislative session, that I would (1) bring together representative doctors of medicine, doctors of osteopathy, chiropractic practitioners, and officials of the State Health Department and the State Education Department to examine the chiropractic licensure problem in the state, and (2) ask them to develop recommendations for a proposal to be introduced at this legislative session that would be equitable to the groups involved and in the best interests of the health of the people of the state. Following my public statement last year: 1. Representative doctors of the State Medical Society, including its executive vice-president, met with me in the spring and undertook this assignment. 2. They then met with representativ e doctors of the State Osteopathic Society in the summer and jointly proposed that, if chiropractors were to be licensed by the state, it s hould be on the basis of the same educational and examination standards as doctors of medicine an doctors of osteopathy, but with specific limitations on the scope of their practice. Notes on the History of X-ray in Chiropractic Keating 21 3. Working from this proposal, the representative doctors of these two societies participated in le ngthy discussions and recommended detailed provisions for inclusion in a draft bill which later becam e the present Peterson-Rules Com mittee Bill. 4. In January , representatives of the S tate Health Departm ent and State Education Department, and re presentative doctors of the S tate Medical S ociety and S tate Os teopathic S ociety , met with representatives of the Chiropractic Association to discuss the question of licensure and the principal provisions of a draft bill which are now contained in the Peterson-Rules Com mittee Bill. At that time, the proposal was silent and left open for later resolution any provision governing the use of X-ray . 5. Representatives of all three medical, osteopathic, and chiropractic groups subsequently met separately with Sol Neil Corbin, m y counsel, later in January , to discuss the proposed bill. Thes e repres entatives of the M edical Society and Osteopathic Society expressed no concern with its li censing and regulatory provisions, except for the inclusion of any provi sions perm itting the use of X-ray . Representatives of the Chiropractic Association proposed certain of the licensing and regulatory provisions, and urged the inclusion of provisions perm itting the unrestricted use of X-ray . 6. Following these m eetings, th e State Departm ent of Health undertook the drafting of strict X-ra y provisions required to protect the public against excessive radiation and gonadal exposure to X-ray . 7. The State health Department's proposal on the strict use of X- ray was then incorporated verbatim in the proposed bill, following discussions with repres entatives of the S tate M edical S ociety . 8. Immediately prior to the introduction of the Peterson-Rules Com mittee Bill on February twentieth, representatives of the Medical Society met with m e and expres sed no concern with its licensing and regulatory provisions, except for those relating to X-ray . They did admit, however, that thes e X-ra y provisions, enforced by the commissioner of health, would protect the public against excessive radiation and gonadal exposure. Thus , repres entatives of the S tate M edical S ociety , including some of its officers, were consulted and participated in the preparation of the Peterson-Rules Com mittee Bill at every state of its development. The Peterson-Rules Com mittee Bill is realistic and sound. It acknowledges the widespread practice of chiropractic in the state, and provides a sy stem of licensure a nd regulation designed to establish high standards of competence for the protection of the public. Among the m ost significant provisions of the bill are: *Creation of a seven-member Board of Chiropractic Examiners, appointed by the Board of Regents, which would include a doctor of medicine, a doctor of osteopathy , and an educator among its members. *Educational requirements as a prerequis ite to licens ure, consisting of two years of college and four y ears of resident study at a school of chiropractic approved by the State Education Department. *Licensure on the basis of exam inations in seven basic science subjects , the us e and effects of X-ray , and the practice of chiropractic. The exam ination in the s even bas ic science subjects would be the same as that pres cribed by the Board of Medical Exam iners for doctors of medicine and doctors of osteopathy . The exam ination in chiropractic and in the use and effects of X-ray would be prepared by the Board of Chiropractic Exam iners . *Grandfather provisions deemed ad equate and, at the same time, equitable with respect to those who have been engaged in the practice of chiropractic. *Restricting the use of X-ray to (a) diagnostic purposes, (b) persons over eighteen y ears of age, and (c) a level above the top of the first lumbar vertebra, which rest rictions would be enforced by the Department of Health. *Suit by the attorney general to enforce any violation of the bill. There have been gross misrep resentations concerning a second bill which has been introduced solely to m ake technical legal amendm ents to the Peterson-Rules Com mittee Bill. This second bill simply conforms the \"grandfather\" provisions to those in the Peterson-Rules Com mittee Bill govern ing persons who have never before practiced chiropractic in the s tate. The Peterson-Rules Com mittee Bill provides that the proposed Board of Chiropractic Exam iners shall prepare the exam ination in the us e and effects of X- ray. The second bill m erely makes clear, without substantive change, that this Board s hall als o prepare the X-ray exam ination ques tions for the \"grandfathers,\" namely those chiropractors who have been practicing in the s tate for two y ears or m ore. The X-ray exam ination, as in all other subjects, would be adm inistered by the Education Department. In summary , it is my firm conviction that a sy stem of chiropractic licens ure and s trict regulation is neces sary at this time, and that the Peterson-Rules Com mittee Bill should be prom ptly enacted. In the interests of reason and enlightenment, y ou may feel free to read this letter at the opening of the Rules Com mittee hearing today . S incerely , (signed) Nelson A. Rockefeller Governor of New York Editor's note: As reported in la st month's Journal, chiropractic was regulated by the s tate legi slature of New York, passing both houses by great m argins. Governor Rockefeller signed the bill on April 30, 1963, thus making New York the forty -seventh state to license doctors of chiropractic. 1963 (July /Aug): Dige st of Chiropra ctic ood, dedicated to prof essional unity and advancement\" (pp. 9-22, 62, 64, 66-7); many photographs, including: Dr. Earl A.

Spinal movements forward, backward, a nd sideway s were consistently reduced one-third in the horizontal position when compared to the standing position. \"Gravity aids man in some of his movements in the upright position, but in the horizontal position the lack of gravitational pull reduces the range of motion of the spine of the astronaut,\" Dr. Higley stated. \"Assigned tasks of the astronaut should therefore be modified or designed to fit the spinal m obility capabilities while in space.\" \"Since the potential of spinal m ovem ent of the astronaut still exists, it m ay be pos sible,\" according to the Higley report, \" to train and develop spinal m ovem ents in s pace by continued training in gravity -less environments.\" The full report, which involve s approximately 100 pages of charts, graphs, x-ray s, and photogra phs, is being made available to the National Aeronautics and S pace Adm inistration (NAS A).

Glover Two scientists met on the cam pus of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic recently , when Dr. John R. Glover called on Dr. H.G. Higley to dis cuss current res earch in cas es of low back pain. Dr. Glover is a Senior Lecturer in Occupational Health at the Welsh National School of Medicine at the University of Wales at Cardiff. Dr. Henry G. Higley is the Director of the Department of Research and S tatistics of the Am erican Chiropractic Association, with offices in Glendale, California. A friendship by correspondence betw een these two men started many years ago when Dr. Higley read an article by Dr. Glover which was published in Lancet May of 1960 entitled \"Back Pain and Hyperaesthesia\" and Dr. Glover read the monograph the \"Intervertebral Disc Sy ndrome\" by Dr. Higley published also in 1960. In his article, Dr. Glover describes a sy ndrome of back pain comprising a skin hy peraes thesia associated with a tender s pot, a dull ache, and a limitation of spinal movement due to pain. One hundred cases of this sy ndrom e were studied in detail; in 86 of them 132 areas of hy peraesthesia were found, and these areas followed the sclerotom es rather than the derm atom es. After one s uccessful manipulation, the sy ndrome usually disappeared with a few m inutes . The hy peraesthesia is thought to be skin component of pain arising in deep m esoderm al structures. The sy ndrome may be due to nipping of the interarticular facts of the sacroiliac joint, or to tension of a joint ligam ent. In either cas e, the author reports that manipulation restores the normal function of the joints. In a more recent article published in the Proceedings of the Roy al Society of Medicine in 1966 entitled, \"A Clinical Trial of Rotational Manipulation of the Spine in Back Pain Cases Occurring in a Factory ,\" Dr. Glover describes a st udy that he is conducting at the Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company , Limited Cippenha, Wiltshire, and has been designed for all cases of back pain occurring among the 4,500 employ ees. The aim of the study is to determine the quantitative changes in pain, hyperaesthesia, and tenderness following rotational m anipulation of the lum bar spine. An instrum ent adopted from Sir Henry Head's Algom eter is used to measure the amount of load to be applied by a 1 cm diameter spherical nylon head to elicit tenderness. The readings are in kilogram s. In May , 1968, Dr. Glover informed Dr. Higley that he would be coming to the United S tates and that late in October he would be lecturing at the Univers ity of California at Berkeley and indicated his interes t in the s ubject of res earch into the location and causes of back pain and in vis iting the res earch center for the American Chiropractic Association. Dr. Glover was on the campus of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic for three hours on October 14, 1968, at which time Dr. Glover and Dr. Higley exchanged research notes which included the new program to be conducted in England and the studies on the mechanics of the lum bar spine which were recently completed and are now in m anuscript form ready for publication. This m anuscript reports the results of four y ears of study of 200 cases with the use of the cineroentgenography facilities at Lincoln Chiropractic College. Dr. Higley stated, \"I was delighted to meet Dr. Glover in person and we certainly will continue our transoceanic consultations. W e agreed to keep each other inform ed of the progres s of our work for better coordination of effort and to avoid duplication.\" 1969: Nilson Santos, D.C. and r adiology residents of Wolf dler DO, DC, ND, LLB; editorial notes (p. 6): Dr. Adler was born February 19, 1899 in New York City .

Hariman, D.C. (DGHariman@aol.com): When George Hariman began hi s chiropractic career the healing professions were in a state of flux in the United States. The Flexner Report on medical education had just shown that the standards of medical school education was deplorab le and that the licensure was not standardized. There were m any healers and healing strategems available from the m agnetic healers to the various form s of manipulators and homeopathic vs. a llopathic medical controversy . Anything seem ed possible and even the practitioners were uncertain of what practice would evolve into. Chiropractic, of course, was at th at time, divided and defined in two camps. D.D. Palmer and his son, B.J. Palmer of Iowa on the one side with their adherents as well as the people like Harper, Harring, Drain, Logan et al who had left Palmer and would eventually start their own schools defined the very conservative but radical wing of the profession and espoused the \"one cause- one cure theorum\" as it evolved. On the other extrem e was W.C. Schulze, a medical physician who was leader of the National College of Chiropractic in Chicago. This was a school m ore in the tradition of a m edical faculty with connections to Cook County Hospital, lecturers of some note and featured bas ic science educa tion including dissection. These were dubbed the \"mixers\". There was a high degree of concern for diagnosis in its day and the school remained a leader in scientific introspection and investigation within the profession. When George Hariman began prac tice, he had the adjuncts of physiotherapy which included long wa ve diathermy (a dangerous but effective heat source for therapy ) contractile currents for muscular reeducation (called a sine wave because of the m ultiplicity of currents available which bas ically showed the s ine curve m ade by the McIntosh Company ) heat lamps and a rudimentary adjusting table made by the Zenith Company . The x-ray was the open wire ty pe with available factors of about 15 ma and 85 kvp. A far cry from modern equipm ent and only som ewhat better than the original Roentgen lab equipment. There was a hand held flouroscope which provided as much or more radiation to the operator as the patient and no idea of the dangers of radiation. The largest danger was the high tension exposed cables which occasionally shocked the operator. Long exposures were the rule and film was surprisingly readable but usually motion was present producing a blurring. When George Harim an becam e interes ted in the NCA it was becaus e he was active in the North Dakota Chiropractic As sociation. Someone \"had to\" go to the conven tion in Philadelphia about 1933 or 34 and George volunteered. He becam e interes ted in the benefits of a national voice for the profession. E xpenses were almost non-existant in those days so it was a persona l expense. As the organization evolved, he was a voice for the form ation of hospitals and also was known as a level headed doer. Before he was elected to the Executive Board it was a very loose organization which was operating under the aegis m ainly of L.M. Rogers of Iowa and Lillard Marshall of Kentucky and Jim, Slocum . In m any way s it was to their personal benefit. Many others were able to \"use\" the NCA for personal satisfaction and some gain. Emmett Murphy ingratiated himself as a Washington Lobby ist for NCA first by saying that he just wanted to help for no fee. Then he had a subscription list of the profession and finally was hired on staff. He was an adequate person and he served as well as could be expected but his perfo rmance was alway s somewhat les s than his promise and he was often th e victim of the process in making prom ises that could not be com pleted. The incident of the Tolan bill comes to mind. Mr. Tolan was a congressman from California and the chiropractic bill that he introduced in m ultiple congresses was alway s in com mittee but never s aw the light of day . Much money was given to the congressman for his efforts or lack of same. Meanwhile Em mett's greatest claim to value was to get tires during Notes on the History of X-ray in Chiropractic Keating 30 the war for chiropractors from the ra tioning boards. John Nugent was also an individual who was purported to have an independent income and served as the spokesman and titular head of the education wing of the NCA. He made a wonderful appearance but was not a great planner or thinker. He served us well in his small niche. John Schnick of Ontario was the apparent spokesman for Canada. Since the organization was loose, he was the only member from Canada present and he enjoyed being the debonair bon vivant. Being unmarried he was a great man with the ladies with his manners and air of sophistication. The men we re unworried about him since they got the picture that he was a homose xual. I am unaware that he ever contributed much beyond his presence. George determined that there was a need for a good national journal and he was a leader in the push to buy a printing plant. The plant was in the home town of L.M. Rogers and George was one of several who gave the money to the NC A as a \"loan\" to buy the plant. To my knowledge, he was never repaid this loan and he chalked it up to professional needs. Several men who served on the Executive Board with George were good friends beginning with C. O. Watkins of Montana who was an early mentor. These included Schwietert of South Dakota, Wheaton of Connecticut, Goodfellow of California and to a lesser extent Creggar of California George was also involved with the school people and when he gave money for the founding of the FCER he began to take an interest in schools since they were the main beneficiaries. While he was enamored by W.A.Budden, he lost some of the enthusiasm when his son went to Western States College and was less than impressed. Janse of National College was alwa ys well received and George made a contribution and served on the building board for the new campus of his alma mater. He had respect for Leo Spears and worked with him as best he could to promote other hospitals but they remained almost exclusive as hospital builders. George was always looking fo r ways for accomodation between the mixers and the straights, especia lly at the higher levels. While he disdained B.J. Palmer, He had hi gh regard for David Palmer. He wanted to include Logan and Harp er and was very pleased when Lincoln College and Jim Drain became allied with NCA. His experience with coexistence was colored by the efforts which had been so successful in North Dakota. He felt we needed to make strong united statements in order to survive. (personal note: he would be, as I am, dismayed with the cacaphony which persists as to what is the place of chiropractic in the healing arts.) He served two terms on the Board of Governors or Executive Director and against advice he ran for a third term and was defeated. He could have been elected Presiden t but he couldn't see that this was the office he should take. He c ontinued to be a delegate to the ACA for many years after this and he worked tirelessly in North Dakota as a lobbyist for the asso ciation during turbulent times. During this time the NCA continued its concern with scientific investigation. Considerable effort was placed on the use of full spine radiography as an investigativ e medium and positioning was much talked about by pioneers such as Vl adeff, Logan and others as well as diagnosis by Wunsch, Giammarino, Rich, Janse and others. In addition they funded the work of Fred Illi in Switzerland investigating the sacroiliac region a nd pelvis for mechanical problems and function. Its successor, th e ACA carried on the Councils of Radiology and Hospitals and Edu cation and expanded them into specialty programs in Orthopedics, Ra diology and others attesting to the continued interest in excelle nce in therapeutic approach He was very effective at the endeavors he undertook because he always gave it all he had. He was willing to back his enthusiasm with his purse regardless of the condition of the purse and while he did not take criticism or defeat lightly, he never held a grudge. He asked for no medals and generally received none . But he was highly regarded and knew it and that was enough. 2002 (May 14): e-mail from Jim Winterstein DACBR (jwinterstein@nuhs.edu): Thanks Joe. Another bit of trivia - I was the first radiology resident (in an ABCR approved residency) to have th e GI Bill pay for the residency. At the time I was at National, ma ny veterans had gone through the DC program on the GI Bill, but there had been no residency program prior to that at National (there was one at Lincoln and another at LACC) that was approved by the ABCR for purposes of writing the diplomate exam in radiology. Li ke Lincoln and LACC, National had a program and had one person in it but it still required the so-called resident to take the weekend course before sitting for the exam. The residency program submitted in 1966 by Leonard Richie (National's roentgenologist) was finally approve d at a meeting in Indianapolis and Don Tomkins, Charles Tasharski and I were the first residents to be a part of this program which encompassed no fewer than 4400 hours of post-professional study. In 1970, Don and I wrote the diplomate board along with three of the residents from Lincoln and LACC, who had taken the weekend course. Our examiners included Leo Wunch, Joe Howe, Douglas Ray, Mike Giammarino, Don Hariman and Earl Swallen. Don and I passed and became the first completely residency trained diplomates of the American Chiropractic Board of Radiology on June 1, 1970. Charles Tasharski never wrote the board and Don unfortunately died in 1980 of leukemia. Following our success at the board, Don and I were made co-chairs of ra diology, and in 1971 when Don left National to go to the Ortman Clinic to establish their first radiology center, I became the chair of radiology. My first residents included Adolph Bucher from Switzerland who dropped out, Leo Kelzo who did not complete the program, Terry Yochum, David Taylor (who never took the board) Larry Pizek, who is a diplomate, and Ray Conley who is a diplomate. Reed Phillips began his residency when I was still in the department, but had relinquished the chair to Joe Howe since I was then in full tim e practice (sometime in 1972). I finished my first stint at National on November 1 of 1973 and moved to Florida to practice. Actually a long way of telling you that I think I was the first chiropractic resident to receive G I Bill money for a residency program. Jim 2002 (May 30): e-mail from Jim Winterstein DACBR (jwinterstein@nuhs.edu): Dear Joe, Congratulations on the contract with George. Should be an interesting opportunity. I do not know a lot about Logan. When I became active in the profession, Coggins was president - I did get to know him a little. Later, of course, I because quite friendly with Bea Hagen and, in fact had her as a commencement speaker here at National, and if memory serves me correctly, we gave her an honorary degree. I read Hugh Logan's book on spinographic analysis in 1966 - he was one of the early ones who understood the geometric effects of using a cone shaped, three dimensional beam (x-ray) and passing it through a 3 dimensional person and recording the resulting image on a two dimensional film. There a many hazards there with respect to what the final image looks like and he had a quite good understanding of that. I liked his book. Jim P.S. I have only one basic scien ce certificate - from South Dakota. Illinois was a reciprocated license as was Florida along with the National Boards Part I and II. I will make a digital copy of the SD certificate and send it to you.

Maurer\" (p. 6); includes photograph: Edward L. Maurer, DC, DACBR, died unexpectedly at his home in Kalamazoo, Michigan, on March 27, 2003. Dr. Maurer was a giant among his contemporaries, and a ma n of unquestioned integrity . His friend and colleague for 30 y ears, Kerwin W inkler, DC, commented on the loss that Dr. Maurer's passing represents, saying, \"Nobody brought to the table the depth and breadth of his knowledge and wisdom.\" Dr. Winkler praised, as well, Dr. Maurer's \"unwavering loyalty and service to the Am erican Chiropractic Association.\" Dr. Maurer graduated from Lincoln Chiropractic College in 1961, and was board certified in radiology . From 1973, he served on the post-graduate faculty in radiology for the National University of Health Sciences in Lom bard, IL. He s erved as Michigan's ACA delegate from 1980 to 1991. In 1983, Dr. Maurer was named Chiropractor of the Year by the M ichigan State Chiropractic Association, and received its legislative leadership award in 1987. He held various elected positions in the Am erican Chiropractic College of Radiology and on the ACA's Council on Diagnostic Imaging. He served for seven y ears on the ACA Board of Governors, first as Governor of ACA's District #2 - which includes Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Ca nada. In 1997, he was elected Chairm an of the Board of Governors, a position he held until 1999, also serving as a member of the ACA Executive Com mittee. That same year, Dr. M aurer was nam ed as Chairm an of the new Journal of the American Chiropractic Association ( JACA) Editorial Review Committee, a position he stamped uniquely with his far- reaching vision and im mense energy until his death. The com mittee becam e the JACA Editorial Board in 2002, in recognition of the quality and quantity of effort provide d under his leadership to assure that ACA publication standards neve r faltered. He was also Editor- in-Chief of ACA Press, the publishing arm of the ACA. In 2001, Dr. Maurer was named ACA Chiropractor of the Year. He was recognized at the 2003 National Chiropractic Legislative Conference with one of the association's hi ghest honors - the Chairman's Award - for his many contributions to the ACA and to the profession. Dr. Maurer poured his considerable energies into those projects that, in his belief, would benefit th e future of chiropractic. As its fundraising chairm an, Dr. Maurer becam e one of the driving forces behind the creation of the Florida State University College of Chiropractic. He als o embarked on a collaborative effort with participating health care organizations in the U.S. Bone & Joint Decade. Dr. M aurer volunteered to repres ent ACA in the Decade's effort to educate the public about diseases of the bones and joints during the final two y ears of his life, a responsibility that he carried out in his ty pical manner - with vigor and a wealth of fresh ideas. Dr. Maurer wrote two textbooks, contribut ed several chapters to others, and published numerous articles in scientific and trade journals. Dr. M aurer practiced at the Kalam azoo Chiropractic Center with Valdis Muizznieks, DC. He is su rvived by a son, Lance, who is study ing to become a doctor of chiropractic at Logan College of Chiropractic, and a daughter, Terry , who is married and has two children. ___________________________________________ VISIT TO Cle veland/LA , 8/12-8/14/90 -Carl Cleveland Jr. says TF Ratledge, D.C. had no x-ray equipment at time of purchas e of Ratledge College, i.e., 1951- 55 (but Dr. T ed L. Shrader insists he learned and used x-ray at Ratledge College in late 1930s) ___________________________________________ Notes fro m Keatin (1992; Chapter 4): Fred W . Illi, D.C. Chiropractors were early and eager developers of x-ray equipment and technique. BJ Palmer had introduced an early roen tgenograp hic device the PSC by 1910-1911. Spinogr aphy , as BJ called it, was seen as a method \"to verify or deny palpation findings and to verify or deny proof of the existence of vertebral subluxations (Cantebury & Krakos, 1986). The PSC offered a elective cours e in 1910 or 1911, which becam e a required subject at the \"Fountainhead\" in 1924. Early Palmer faculty radiologists taught and practiced diagnostic as well as spinal analy tic procedures, and included dental views, contrast tec hniques and fluoroscopy in their repertoire (Cantebury & Krakos, 1986). By the early 1920s faculty at the PSC' s rival, the Universal Chiropractic College, were experim enting with the first weight-bearing views of the spine and pelvis. This is ironic, since the Palm er/Loban split cam e over PSC's introduction of x-ray .... Carver's theories also gave im petus to the bas ic anatom ic studies of the pelvis conducted during the 1940s by Fred Illi, D.C. of Switzerland and Joseph Janse, D. C., long-time president of the National College of Chiropractic. Illi was the first person to demonstrate (Illi, 1951), by means of cineroen tgenograp hy, the motion of the sacro-iliac joints (Rosenthal, 1981). Baker (1985) credits Illi with a three-pronged a pproach to study of the pelvis: motion x-ray investigations, model- building and human dissection. The life-long work of this Swiss chiropractor provides a model for clinically relevant basic science investigations in chiropractic. Notes on the History of X-ray in Chiropractic Keating 32 Joseph J. Janse, D.D.T., D.C. Also noteworthy for early research efforts in cineroentgenography are studies by Earl Rich, D.C. at the Lincoln College in Indianapolis during the 1960s. Rich collaborated with the Picker X-ray Company to develop special equipment, and a ttracted several tens of thousands of dollars from FACE (the Foundation for Accredited Chiropractic Education, now the FCER: Foundation for Chiropractic Education & Research) to underwrite his work. When Dr. Rich died in 1967 the project was transferred to Joseph Howe, D.C., D.A.C.B.R., and was funded ($10,000) jointly by the FCER and the ACA... The past two decades have witnessed growing attention am ong inves tigators to the characteris tics of m easurem ent in chiropractic. Exemplary have been a number of studies of the validity and reproducibility of the observation sy stem s used in practice, and of potential value in manipulation research. Much of this effort has been focused on the evaluation of measurement methods already in use by chiropractors, especially palpation (e.g., DeBoer et al., 1985; Herzog Bergma nn et al., 1990; Nansel, Peneff et al., 1989), relative leg length inequality (DeBoer et al., 1983; Shambaugh et al., 1988; Venn et al., 1983; Youngquist et al., 1989) and x-ray analy sis (e.g., Haas et al., 1990; Phillips et al., 1990). However, several novel assessment procedures have also been quantitatively explored by chiropractors, including contourography (Speijers et al., 1975), video-fluoroscopy of cervical s pine m otion (Antos et al., 1990), para-spinal tissue-compliance (Jansen et al. 1990), electronic recording of refl ex phenomena (Humphrey s et al., 1989) and para-spinal electro-my ography during full ces Robinson GK, Keating JC, J acobs GE.
