TCM means the promotion, maintenance and restoration of health and prevention of a disorder, imbalance or disease based on traditional Chinese medicine theory by utilization of the primary therapies. TCM encompasses many different practices, including: acupuncture, moxibustion (burning an herb above the skin to apply heat to acupuncture points), Chinese herbal medicine, tui na (Chinese manipulative therapy), dietary therapy, and tai chi and qi gong (practices that combine specific movements or postures, coordinated breathing, and mental focus). Brief History of TCM & Acupuncture Regulation in BC Both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and acupuncture are currently regulated under the [Health Professions Act (B.C.
