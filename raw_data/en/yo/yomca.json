These contribute to strengthening the energetic structure of our working relationship and assist in creating a mutually supportive and harmonious energy exchange and agreement. I trust this will also answer many commonly asked questions. Please take the time to read this before you call to inquire about an appointment. When you pay for a healing session you give your consent and agree to all the following Terms and Conditions. WHAT I OFFER: My practice is an integration of spiritual psychology (otherwise known as spiritual, transpersonal or transformational psychotherapy, or holistic counseling), energy healing, multi-dimensional ascension healing, core pattern release/ego dismantling, vibrational healing with voice and self-mastery mentoring. My work meets each client at the level they are at and supports all people at all stages of awakening. The work supports and brings relief and resolution to: depression anxiety negative habits and patterns that cause distress excessive worry, fear and doubt physical pain unresolved trauma past life, ancestral and karmic trauma attachments and dark energy awakening/ascension symptoms As your transformational guide, it is my responsibility to provide a safe space for you to share your experiences, issues, and feelings, and listen with neutrality and compassion. I also ask questions to guide you in your exploration, highlight your choices, encourage you to express your feelings, challenge you, and identify your defenses. Spirit is the healer. I am the vessel for the healing, and you hold the ultimate responsibility for your own well-bein. You are fully responsible for your choices and the decision to undertake healing, for yourself and any conditions that may or may not occur in conjunction with the healing. The benefit you derive from our work together depends upon your openness to the process, and your willingness & commitment to your spiritual growth. It's up to you to actively participate with your consciousness expansion or the healing process. To clarify expectations it's helpful to say what I do not offer: I am not a clinical or licensed psychotherapist, and my services are considered alternative/holistic. The services I provide do not encompass diagnosing any disorder as found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or providing any medical diagnosis or treatment. My services are not intended as a substitute or cure for any disease, health condition or psychiatric/mental condition. No claim is made for the treatment or cure of any new or previous medical or psychiatric conditions. I do not advise or dispense medication/supplements, nor supervise any medication/supplements you may receive from other healthcare providers. I do not provide reports for insurance companies. The impact and effect from healing is individualized and dependent upon a wide array of influences, and therefore no guarantee of personal results can be made. I do offer healing support for children and teens. I kindly ask that you make me aware of additional care you are currently receiving by any other coach/counselor/physician/alternative or complementary healthcare practitioner as it may impact our work together. I also believe it is your responsibility to let any other counselor or healthcare practitioner working with you to know of our work together. Where you feel it would be to your advantage, with discernment, please feel free to pass along my web address to provide an understanding of the services that I offer. How sessions are facilitated: Individual healing sessions and couples sessions are currently offered in-person and online via zoom. Both are equally as effective. Healing Consistency: The healing journey is unique to each person. The number of sessions required is dependent upon the concern(s) you wish to address and several variables. One issue can require several sessions to address its various aspects or you may experience complete resolution in one go, but this will unfold organically. While I always hold the highest intention for the most transformative healing possible for you, I cannot predict or guarantee how your consciousness will process your inner work, what is karmically available for healing, and the multifaceted emotional process unique within each individuals healing journey. It is recommended that you commit to yourself to have consistent, consecutive sessions to experience the greatest momentum and most powerful healing benefits in your spiritual evolution. In the beginning of your healing journey is it suggested to commit to more frequent sessions and slowly taper off. This is often every 2-3 weeks, however, you may need more time between sessions for integration, or wish to do sessions more frequently. If resources limit you from attending consecutive sessions please make a commitment to yourself to create change, begin the process and then have a session whenever it's possible. It is helpful to embark on any healing in the best way you can. Even one session can bring about significant change the soul needs to catalyze into greater expansion. I arrange my schedule to make wise use of my energy, so appointments are booked on a first come first serve basis. To reserve an appointment space, it is ideal to book your next appointment at the end of a session, in order to help you to keep your commitment to yourself. Session intention & length: The intention with each healing session is to create movement and change for you, identify, locate and address the root cause, be as thorough as possible, and bring the session to a stable closure. With an integrated approach that often requires that you move through your emotions and raise your consciousness, it takes time to complete your processing on an issue. Initial sessions typically last 2 hours, sometimes longer. All sessions are ideally kept open-ended so the work is not rushed and unfolds organically. All of my sessions are in-depth/intensive and please consider that depending on length, one of these sessions can be the equivalent of 2-4 sessions with another practitioner. Please allow yourself adequate time for the organic nature of our sessions. The fee will be pro-rated accordingly. If you feel that you cannot keep the session open-ended and wish to put a boundary on the time it's understandable. You are free to book a session for 1, 2, 2.5, 3 or 3.5 hours - please see below. Please let me know upon booking so that I can schedule my time as well. 1-hour sessions are for purely gentle clearings and chakra balancing, intuitive readings, or those new to healing. In-depth core-wound, psychospiritual or recalibration healing, is not possible within an hour, especially for those receiving clearing in this way for the first time. My current hourly fees: I work by the hour and at an hourly rate of $115/hr for the first two hours and $105/hr for every additional hour. There is an additional fee of $25 for initial sessions. The total fee is always based upon my time and energy that is devoted to your healing in the total time we spend together, and is non-negotiable. Sometimes you may prefer to keep following the energy beyond the booked time. If we exceed the agreed upon booked and paid time, additional time is pro-rated and charged based upon my current hourly fee above. Payment is in full at the finish of our session. You are responsible for this payment, no exceptions. All fees are non-negotiable. All fees charged and payments made are non-negotiable and non-refundable. It is not in our practice to offer refunds. Sessions can be rescheduled within 48 grace period and must be used within 60 days of session or package purchase. Payments can be made via cash, which is preferred, Paypal, Venmo or checks made out to 'into the heart'. What to expect and your responsibilities: Before the session: You lead the session. It's helpful to take a few quiet minutes before each session to get clear of the nature of your visit and what you are desiring to clear, release or see with more clarity. In session we will clarify your healing intention and from there, I will discern our healing focus. During the session: Whether working with me in person or over the phone, your full presence is required. This is a sacred healing space and requires my full and focused presence as well. For phone/skype sessions, please be focused and fully present: do not multi-task at any time and please be sure that you have privacy, and remain free of interruptions and distractions during the entire session. Please have your phone battery adequately charged if necessary, and please turn off all other cell phones or communication devices. This is all helpful to both of us to maximize focus and minimize interference. I can only provide guidance with respect to the issues you identify and express to me, so please do your very best to be honest, and fully present, focused and willing to do your work. Moving through change can be uncomfortable at times. Resistance is quite common in a session, and it's my role to gently guide you through this to bring you to your deeper insights. This is one way that change is created for you. However, should there be anything in our session that makes you extremely uncomfortable, please bring it to my attention in the moment. In the first session, we have time to connect and I ask specific questions to gather an overview of your history and what spiritual material is arising for you. The intake is focused with these concern(s) in mind so that we make the most effective use of our time together. This process gives me insights, and can serve to catalyze your inner awareness, especially if you are beginning your healing journey or beginning emotional clearing work. Once we have shared adequately, we will set the space with a prayer, sit for a healing tea ceremony in silence, and then move into my treatment room. In each session, we begin each session with a conversation to understand your intention, set the space, meditate with tea ceremony and I then follow my intuition to whichever combination of tools and techniques would be most effective to guide you and bring healing to you/your child/your animal companion. Your priority is to stay focused on your inner awareness during session, so constant note-taking is discouraged. However, I acknowledge that you receive lots of helpful information during a session so if you wish to take the time to make a note of something significant during or at the end of a session, please let me know and we can create the space for that. Any information or suggestions provided by me is at no time to be construed as binding advice or directives. You have full responsibility and accountability for all actions and consequences arising from our work together. You may not attend any session under the influence of recreational drugs or alcohol as this prevents us from maximizing the benefits of the session. I reserve the right to cancel the session and charge you my full fee for the reserved session time if you do so. Please refrain from chewing gum/candy, consuming caffeine, smoking, or eating during session as this interferes with your processing. However, replenishing your body with water is essential. Please come to session free of distractions, and centered as best possible. For in-person sessions, to accommodate chemical sensitivities and allergies, please refrain from wearing any scented products. Each session is conducted with an understanding of strict confidentiality. All records are also kept strictly confidential. Please note that there are limits to the confidentiality when it comes to my knowledge that you may harm yourself or another person. In addition, on very rare occasions, if another therapist is consulted when issues arise that are outside my area of expertise, you will not be identified by name without your permission. If I feel our work is outside the realm of my expertise, then I will refer you to another therapist if possible. I retain the right to terminate therapy at any time and explain my reasons for doing so. After the session: It's up to you to invest your time and effort to expand your consciousness, outside of the session. Spending some quiet time to journal or absorb the learning in your session will also deepen the healing. For in-office/phone/Skype sessions, I do not provide written session summaries to you, as I trust that you receive what you need in the moment, and what matters is what you take away from session. I will sometimes e-mail you suggested exercises or tools if and as they arise from the session, but it's your responsibility to note what's been suggested to you for further self-support and integration. Completion of the exercises that you do on your own, outside of session, will greatly enhance our work together and your progress. Please bring completed exercises back with you to the next session to possibly further learn from them. After the session, as you integrate the healing, it's up to you to stay aware of how your experience of yourself has shifted- what's changed and also what is rising to the surface of your consciousness as the next organic layer to address. This is input for the next session. Current clients - urgent support between appointments: Please allow time for session integration and use the tools suggested so that you learn to support yourself. It's often the case that once the session integrates, the next layer in your consciousness that requires healing will surface and this is addressed in another separate session. However, if, at the rare time, if what's surfacing in your experience from our session feels emotionally unmanageable and urgent, and you would like my support, please contact me by phone and let me know it's urgent if you get my voice mail. Please respectfully choose to call during my office hours if at all possible, and let me know when and at what number you can best be reached. Depending on the circumstances, we will either help you to move through your difficulty in the moment and/or arrange a session as soon as possible. Charges will apply according to individual circumstances, and the length of our time spent together, based on my current hourly rate. Please note that I do not offer emergency services. If you are suicidal or in addiction crisis please call your local support services who specialize in these matters. Often it's not possible for me to provide same-day appointments. I retain the right at my sole discretion to refuse servicing an established client or a prospective client, and will so advise the individual at the earliest possible time, stating my reasons for doing so. I reserve the right to change these Terms and Conditions at my sole discretion. Terms are always up-dated on this page. "}
