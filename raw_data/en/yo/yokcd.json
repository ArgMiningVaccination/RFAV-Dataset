A B S T R A C T Background This review is one of a series on drugs used to treat chronic neuropathic pain. Estimates of the population prevalence of chronic pain with neuropathic components range between 6% and 10%. Current pharmacological treatment options for neuropathic pain aord substantial benefit for only a few people, o/f_ten with adverse eects that outweigh the benefits. There is a need to explore other treatment options, with dierent mechanisms of action for treatment of conditions with chronic neuropathic pain. Cannabis has been used for millennia to reduce pain. Herbal cannabis is currently strongly promoted by some patients and their advocates to treat any type of chronic pain. Objectives To assess the eicacy, tolerability, and safety of cannabis-based medicines (herbal, plant-derived, synthetic) compared to placebo or conventional drugs for conditions with chronic neuropathic pain in adults. Search methods In November 2017 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registries for published and ongoing trials, and examined the reference lists of reviewed articles. Selection criteria We selected randomised, double-blind controlled trials of medical cannabis, plant-derived and synthetic cannabis-based medicines against placebo or any other active treatment of conditions with chronic neuropathic pain in adults, with a treatment duration of at least two weeks and at least 10 participants per treatment arm. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently extracted data of study characteristics and outcomes of eicacy, tolerability and safety, examined issues of study quality, and assessed risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. For eicacy, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for pain relief of 30% and 50% or greater, patient's global impression to be much or very much improved, dropout rates due to lack of eicacy, and the standardised mean dierences for pain intensity, sleep problems, health- related quality of life (HRQoL), and psychological distress. For tolerability, we calculated number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) for withdrawal due to adverse events and specific adverse events, nervous system disorders and psychiatric disorders. For safety, we calculated NNTH for serious adverse events. Meta-analysis was undertaken using a random-eects model. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. Cannabis-based medicines for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.1Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Main results We included 16 studies with 1750 participants. The studies were 2 to 26 weeks long and compared an oromucosal spray with a plant- derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) a THC (nabilone) inhaled herbal cannabis (two studies) and plant-derived THC (dronabinol) (two studies) against placebo (15 studies) and an analgesic (dihydrocodeine) (one study). We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess study quality. We defined studies with zero to two unclear or high risks of bias judgements to be high-quality studies, with three to five unclear or high risks of bias to be moderate- quality studies, and with six to eight unclear or high risks of bias to be low-quality studies. Study quality was low in two studies, moderate in 12 studies and high in two studies. Nine studies were at high risk of bias for study size. We rated the quality of the evidence according to GRADE as very low to moderate. Primary outcomes Cannabis-based medicines may increase the number of people achieving 50% or greater pain relief compared with placebo (21% versus 17%; risk dierence (RD) 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 0.09); NNTB 20 (95% CI 11 to 100); 1001 participants, eight studies, low- quality evidence). We rated the evidence for improvement in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) with cannabis to be of very low quality (26% versus 21%;RD 0.09 (95% CI 0.01 (95% CI 6 to 100); 1092 participants, six studies). More participants withdrew from the studies due to adverse events with cannabis-based medicines (10% of participants) than with placebo (5% of participants) (RD 0.04 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.07); NNTH 25 (95% CI 16 to 50); 1848 participants, 13 studies, moderate-quality evidence). We did not have enough evidence to determine if cannabis-based medicines increase the frequency of serious adverse events compared with placebo (RD 0.01 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.03); 1876 participants, 13 studies, low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes Cannabis-based medicines probably increase the number of people achieving pain relief of 30% or greater compared with placebo (39% versus 33%; RD 0.09 (95% CI 0.03 11 (95% CI 7 to 33); 1586 participants, 10 studies, moderate quality evidence). Cannabis- based medicines may increase nervous system adverse events compared with placebo (61% versus 29%; RD 0.38 (95% CI to 6); 1304 participants, nine studies, low-quality evidence). Psychiatric disorders occurred in 17% of participants using cannabis-based medicines and in 5% using placebo (RD 0.10 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.15); NNTH 10 (95% CI 7 to 16); 1314 participants, nine studies, low-quality evidence). We found no information about long-term risks in the studies analysed. Subgroup analyses We are uncertain whether herbal cannabis reduces mean pain intensity (very low-quality evidence). Herbal cannabis and placebo did not dier in tolerability (very low-quality evidence). Authors' conclusions The potential benefits of medicine (herbal cannabis, plant-derived or synthetic THC, THC/CBD oromucosal spray) in chronic neuropathic pain might be outweighed by their potential harms. The quality of evidence for pain relief outcomes reflects the exclusion of participants with a history of substance abuse and other significant comorbidities from the studies, together with their small sample sizes. P L A I N /uni00A0 L A N G U A G E /uni00A0 S U M M A R Y Cannabis products for adults with chronic neuropathic pain Bottom line There is a lack of good evidence that any cannabis-derived product works for any chronic neuropathic pain. Background Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves. It is dierent from pain messages that are carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (for example, a fall, or cut, or arthritic knee). Neuropathic pain is treated by dierent medicines to those used for pain from damaged tissue. Several products based on the cannabis plant have been suggested as treatment for pain, including neuropathic pain. These products include inhaled herbal cannabis, and various sprays or tablets containing active cannabis ingredients obtained from the plant, or made synthetically. Some people with neuropathic pain claim that cannabis-based products are eective for them, and that is o/f_ten highlighted in the media.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.2Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews In November 2017 we searched for clinical trials that used cannabis products to treat conditions with chronic neuropathic pain in adults. We found 16 studies involving 1750 people. Studies lasted 2 to 26 weeks. Studies compared dierent cannabis-based medicines. Ten studies compared an oromucosal (mouth) spray with a plant-derived combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent and cannabidiol (CBD), an anti-inflammatory ingredient of cannabis, against a fake medication (placebo). Two studies each compared inhaled herbal cannabis and cannabis plant-derived THC with placebo, and one cannabinoid mimicking the eects of THC (nabilone) with placebo. One study compared nabilone with a pain killer (dihydrocodeine). Key results and quality of the evidence We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. There was no high-quality evidence. All cannabis-based medicines pooled together were better than placebo for the outcomes substantial and moderate pain relief and global improvement. All cannabis-based medicines pooled together were better than placebo in reducing pain intensity, sleep problems and psychological distress (very low- to moderate-quality evidence). There was no dierence between all cannabis-based medicines pooled together and placebo in improving health-related quality of life, stopping the medication because it was not eective, and in the frequency of serious side eects (low-quality evidence). More people reported sleepiness, dizziness and mental problems (e.g. confusion) with all cannabis-based medicines pooled together than with placebo (low-quality evidence). There was moderate-quality evidence that more people dropped out due to side eects with cannabis-based medicines than with placebo. Herbal cannabis was not dierent from placebo in reducing pain and the number of people who dropped out due to side eects (very low- quality evidence).

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews B A C K G R O U N D The protocol for this review was based on a template for reviews of drugs used to relieve neuropathic pain. The aim is for all reviews to use the same methods, based on new criteria for what constitutes reliable evidence in chronic pain (Moore 2010a; Moore 2012; Appendix 1 ). Description of the condition The 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain definition of neuropathic pain is \"pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system\" (Jensen 2011 ), and based on a definition agreed at an earlier consensus meeting (Treede 2008). Neuropathic pain is a consequence of a pathological maladaptive response of the nervous system to 'damage' from a wide variety of potential causes. It is characterised by pain in the absence of a noxious stimulus and may be spontaneous (continuous or paroxysmal) in its temporal characteristics or be evoked by sensory stimuli (dynamic mechanical allodynia where pain is evoked by light touch of the skin). Neuropathic pain is associated with a variety of sensory loss (numbness) and sensory gain (allodynia) clinical phenomena, the exact pattern of which vary between people and disease, perhaps reflecting dierent pain mechanisms operating in an individual person and, therefore, potentially predictive of response to treatment (Demant 2014 ; Helfert 2015; von Hehn 2012). Pre-clinical research hypothesises a bewildering array of possible pain mechanisms that may operate in people with neuropathic pain, which largely reflect pathophysiological responses in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, including neuronal interactions with immune cells (Baron 2012; Calvo 2012; von Hehn 2012). Overall, the treatment gains in neuropathic pain, to even the most eective of available drugs, are modest (Finnerup 2015 ; Moore 2013a), and a robust classification of neuropathic pain is not yet available (Finnerup 2013 ). Neuropathic pain is usually divided according to the cause of nerve injury. There may be many causes, but some common causes of neuropathic pain include diabetes (painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN)), shingles (postherpetic neuralgia), amputation (stump and phantom limb pain), neuropathic pain a/f_ter surgery or trauma, stroke or spinal cord injury, trigeminal neuralgia, and HIV infection. Sometimes the cause is unknown. Many people with neuropathic pain conditions are significantly disabled with moderate or severe pain for many years. Chronic pain conditions comprised five of the 11 top-ranking conditions for years lived with disability in 2010 (Vos 2012), and are responsible for considerable loss of quality of life and employment, and increased healthcare costs (Moore 2014a). A study in the USA found that healthcare costs were three-fold higher for people with neuropathic pain than matched control participants (Berger 2004). A UK study and a German study showed a two- to three-fold higher level of use of healthcare services in people with neuropathic pain than those without ( Berger 2009; Berger 2012). For postherpetic neuralgia, for example, studies demonstrate a large loss of quality of life and substantial costs (Scott 2006; Van Hoek 2009). In systematic reviews, the overall prevalence of neuropathic pain in the general population is reported to be between 7% and 10% (Van Hecke 2014), and about 7% in a systematic review of studies published since 2000 (Moore 2014a). In individual countries, prevalence rates have been reported as 3.3% in Austria (Gustor2008), 6.9% in France (Bouhassira 2008), and up to 8% in the UK (Torrance 2006). Some forms of neuropathic pain, such as PDN and post-surgical chronic pain (which is o/f_ten neuropathic in origin), are increasing (Hall 2008 ). Estimates of incidence vary between individual studies for particular origins of neuropathic pain, o/f_ten because of small numbers of cases. In primary care in the UK, between 2002 and 2005, the incidences (per 100,000 person-years' observation) were 28 (95% confidence interval (CI), 27 to 30) for PHN, 27 (95% CI, 26 to 29) for trigeminal neuralgia, 0.8 (95% CI, 0.6 to 1.1) for phantom limb pain, and 21 (95% CI, 20 to 22) for PDN (Hall 2008 ). Other studies have estimated an incidence of 4 in 100,000 per year for trigeminal neuralgia (Katusic 1991 ; Rappaport 1994), and 12.6 per 100,000 person-years for trigeminal neuralgia and 3.9 per 100,000 person- years for PHN in a study of facial pain in the Netherlands (Koopman 2009). One systematic review of chronic pain demonstrated that some neuropathic pain conditions, such as PDN, can be more common than other neuropathic pain conditions, with prevalence rates up to 400 per 100,000 person-years (McQuay 2007 ). Neuropathic pain is diicult to treat eectively, with only a minority of people experiencing a clinically relevant benefit from any one intervention (Kalso 2013 ; Moore 2013b). A multidisciplinary approach is now advocated, combining pharmacological interventions with physical or cognitive (or both) interventions. The evidence for interventional management is very weak, or non-existent (Dworkin 2013). Conventional analgesics such as paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not thought to be eective, but without evidence to support or refute that view (Moore 2015a). Some people may derive some benefit from a topical lidocaine patch or low-concentration topical capsaicin, although evidence about benefits is uncertain (Derry 2012; Derry 2014). High-concentration topical 2017). 2014b; eicacy opioids is unconvincing (Gaskell 2016; Sommer 2015 ; Stannard 2016). The proportion of people who achieve worthwhile pain relief (typically at least 50% pain intensity reduction; Moore 2013a) is small, generally only 10% to 25% more than with placebo, with numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) usually between 4 and 10 (Kalso 2013 ; Moore 2013b). Neuropathic pain is not particularly dierent from other chronic pain conditions in that only a small proportion of trial participants have a good response to treatment (Moore 2013b). The current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for the pharmacological management of neuropathic pain suggests oering a choice of amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin, or pregabalin as initial treatment for neuropathic pain (with the exception of trigeminal neuralgia), with switching if the first, second, or third drugs tried are not eective or not tolerated (NICE 2013 ). This concurs with other recent guidelines (Finnerup 2015). There is a need to explore other treatment options, with dierent mechanisms of action and from dierent drug categories, for treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes. Medical cannabis has been promoted by some patient organisations and advocates for Cannabis-based medicines for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews the treatment of chronic pain refractory to conventional treatment and is available for pain management in some countries of the world, e.g. Canada and Israel (Ablin 2016 ). However, the use of cannabis for medical reasons is highly contested because of the adverse health eects of long-term cannabis use for recreational purposes ( Volkow 2014). Description of the intervention The cannabinoid system is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, with multiple functions that move the organism back to equilibrium. A large body of evidence currently supports the presence of cannabinoid (CB) receptors and ligands in the peripheral and central nervous system, but also in other tissues such as bone and in the immune system (Owens 2015). The endocannabinoid system has three broad and overlapping functions in mammals. The first is a stress recovery role, operating in a feedback loop in which endocannabinoid signalling is activated by stress and functions to return endocrine, nervous, and behavioural systems to homeostatic balance. The second is to control energy balance through regulation of the intake, storage, and utilisation of food. The third involves immune regulation; endocannabinoid signalling is activated by tissue injury and modulates immune and inflammatory responses (Hillard 2012). Thus, the endocannabinoid neuromodulatory system appears to be involved in multiple physiological functions, such as anti- nociception, cognition and memory, endocrine function, nausea and vomiting, inflammation, and immune recognition (De Vries 2014; Hillard 2012). Cannabis is a genus of the flowering plant in the family Cannabaceae. The number of species within the genus is disputed. Three species may be recognized, Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis. These plants, commonly known as marijuana, have been used for pain relief for millennia, and have additional eects on appetite, sleep, and mood (Kalant 2001). Data from clinical trials with synthetic and plant-based cannabis-based medicines suggest a promising approach for the management of chronic neuropathic pain of dierent origins (De Vries 2014; Jensen 2015 ). How the intervention might work Cannabis contains over 450 compounds, with at least 70 classified as phytocannabinoids. Two are of particular medical interest. Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC) is the main active constituent, with psychoactive (e.g. reduction of anxiety and stress) and pain-relieving properties. The second molecule of interest is cannabidiol (CBD), which has lower ainity for the cannabinoid (CB) receptors and the potential to counteract the negative eects of THC on memory, mood, and cognition, but also has an eect on pain modulation by anti-inflammatory properties. The specific roles of currently identified endocannabis-based medicines that act as ligands at CB receptors within the nervous system (primarily but not exclusively CB 1 receptors) and in the periphery (primarily but not exclusively CB 2 receptors) are only partially elucidated, but there are abundant pre-clinical data to support their influence on nociception (Owens 2015). It is also hypothesised that cannabis reduces alterations in cognitive and autonomic processing in chronic pain states (Guindon 2009 ). The frontal-limbic distribution of CB receptors in the brain suggests that cannabis may preferentially target the aective qualities of pain (Lee 2013). In addition, cannabismay attenuate low-grade inflammation, another postulate for the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain (Zhang 2015 ). The content of THC and CBD in medical cannabis is highly variable and ranges from 1% to 22% THC and 0.05% to in (nabiximols) oromucosal spray and the THC are standardised (H\u00e4user 2017 ). Taking into consideration the poorly understood pathogenesis of chronic neuropathic pain syndromes, the complexity of symptom expression, and the absence of an ideal treatment, the potential for manipulation of the cannabinoid system as a therapeutic modality is attractive. Why it is important to do this review While recent guidance tends to be generally in agreement about the role of antidepressants and anticonvulsants in the management of chronic neuropathic pain (Finnerup 2015 ; NICE 2013 ), the role of opioids ( Sommer 2015 cannabis-based medicines (H\u00e4user 2017, H\u00e4user 2018 ) is under debate. Recent systematic reviews on the use of cannabis-based medicines to treat chronic pain came to dierent conclusions on their importance in chronic neuropathic pain (Boychuk 2015; Finnerup 2015 ; Petzke 2016; Whiting 2015 ). This was probably due to the inclusion of dierent trials, dierent standards to evaluate the quality of evidence, and dierent weighting of the outcomes of eicacy, tolerability, and safety. Due to the conflicting conclusions of recent systematic reviews on the importance of cannabis-based medicines in treating chronic neuropathic pain, as well as the public debate on the medical use of herbal cannabis for chronic pain (Ablin 2016 ; Fitzcharles 2014), we saw the need for a Cochrane Review applying the standards of Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care (PaPaS).

We excluded studies with fibromyalgia because the nature of fibromyalgia (neuropathic or not) is under debate (Clauw 2015 ); cannabis-based medicines in fibromyalgia are the subject of another Cochrane Review (H\u00e4user 2016). We excluded studies with 'mixed pain' (Baron 2004), because the concept is neither internationally accepted nor suiciently validated and the focus of this review is only neuropathic pain. Types of interventions Cannabis-based medicines, either nabilone), at any dose, by any route, administered for the relief of neuropathic pain and compared to placebo or any active comparator. We did not include studies with drugs under development that manipulate the endocannabinoid system by inhibiting enzymes that hydrolyse endocannabninoids and thereby boost the levels of the endogenous molecules (e.g. blockade of the catabolic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)) (Long 2009). Types of outcome measures The standards used to assess evidence in chronic pain trials have changed substantially in recent years, with particular attention being paid to trial duration, withdrawals, and statistical imputation following withdrawal, all of which can substantially alter estimates of eicacy. The most important change is the move from using mean pain scores, or mean change in pain scores, to the number of people who have a large decrease in pain (by at least 50%) and who continue in treatment, ideally in trials of eight to 12 weeks' duration or longer. These standards are set out in the PaPaS Author and Referee Guidance for pain studies of Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care (Cochrane PaPaS 2012). This Cochrane Review assessed evidence using methods that make both statistical and clinical sense, and will use criteria for what constitutes reliable evidence in chronic pain (Moore 2010a).We anticipated that studies would use a variety of outcome measures, with most studies using standard subjective scales (numerical rating scale (NRS) or visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain intensity or pain relief, or both). We were particularly interested in Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) definitions for moderate and substantial benefit in chronic pain studies (Dworkin 2008). Primary outcomes 1.Participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater. We preferred composite neuropathic pain scores over single-scale generic pain scores if both measures were used by studies; 2.PGIC (Patient Global Impression of Change) much or very much improved; 3.Withdrawals due to adverse events (tolerability); 4.Serious adverse events (safety). Serious adverse events typically include any untoward medical occurrence or eect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, is an 'important medical event' that may jeopardise the person, or may require an intervention to prevent one of the above characteristics/consequences. Secondary outcomes 1.Participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater. We preferred composite neuropathic pain scores over single-scale generic pain scores if both measures were used by studies; 2.Mean pain intensity. We preferred composite neuropathic pain scores over single-scale generic pain scores if both measures were used by adverse event; 9.Specific adverse events, particularly nervous system (e.g. dizziness, somnolence, headache) and psychiatric disorders (e.g. confusion state; paranoia, psychosis, substance dependence) according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (International Council for Harmonisation 2016). Search methods for identification of studies Electronic searches We searched the following databases, without language restrictions: 1.The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO) (searched 7 November 2017); 2.MEDLINE (via Ovid) (1946 to 7 November 2017); 3.Embase (via Ovid) (1974 to 7 November 2017). Appendix 2 shows the search strategies. Cannabis-based medicines for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.8Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Searching other resources We reviewed the bibliographies of any RCTs identified and review articles, and searched the following clinical trials databases: US National Institutes of Health clinical trial register (www.ClinicalTrials.gov), European Union Clinical Trials Register (www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu), World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (apps.who.int/trialsearch/), and International Association for Cannabinoid Medicines (IACM) databank (www.cannabis-med.org/ studies/study.php) to identify additional published or unpublished data. We contacted trial investigators to request missing data. Data collection and analysis We performed separate analyses according to particular neuropathic pain conditions. We combined dierent neuropathic pain conditions in analyses for exploratory purposes only. Selection of studies Two review authors (WH, FP) determined eligibility by reading the abstract of each study identified by the search. We eliminated studies that clearly did not satisfy the inclusion criteria, and obtained full copies of the remaining studies. Two review authors (WH, FP) independently read these studies and reached agreement by discussion. We did not anonymise the studies before assessment. We created a PRISMA flow chart (Moher 2009 ). Data extraction and management Two review authors (WH, FP) extracted data independently using a standard form and checked for agreement before entering data into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2014). Two review authors (WH, MM) extracted independently data calculated by imputation. We included information about the pain condition and number of participants treated, study setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, demographic and clinical characteristics of the study samples (age, gender, race, pain baseline), prior recreational cannabis use, drug and dosing regimen, co-therapies allowed, rescue medication, study design (placebo or active control), study duration and follow- up, analgesic outcome measures and results, withdrawals, and adverse events (participants experiencing any adverse event or serious adverse event). Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Two review authors (WH, FP) independently assessed risk of bias for each study, using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a ), and adapted from those used by Cochrane Musculoskeletal for recent reviews on drug therapy in fibromyalgia, with any disagreements resolved by discussion. We assessed the following for each study. 1.Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). We assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: low risk of bias (i.e. any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); unclear risk of bias (when the method used to generate the sequence was not clearly stated). We excluded studies at a high risk of bias that used a non-random process (e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number). 2.Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). The method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment determines whether intervention allocation couldhave been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment, or changed a/f_ter assignment. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); unclear risk of bias (when method was not clearly stated). We excluded studies that did not conceal allocation and were therefore at a high risk of bias (e.g. open list). 3.Blinding of participants and personnel/treatment providers (systematic performance bias). We assessed the methods used to blind participants and personnel/treatment providers from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (study stated that it was blinded and described the method used to achieve blinding, e.g. identical tablets; matched in appearance and smell); unclear risk of bias (study stated that it was blinded but did not provide an adequate description of how it was achieved); high risk of bias (blinding of participants was not ensured, e.g. tablets dierent in form or taste). 4.Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). We assessed the methods used to blind study outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (study stated that outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention or exposure status of participants); unclear risk of bias (study stated that the outcome assessors were blinded but did not provide an adequate description of how it was achieved); high risk of bias (outcome assessors knew the intervention or exposure status of participants). 5.Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature, and handling of incomplete outcome data). We assessed the methods used to deal with incomplete data as: low risk of bias (i.e. less than 10% of participants did not complete the study or used 'baseline observation carried forward' (BOCF) analysis, or both); unclear risk of bias (used 'last observation carried forward' analysis); or high risk of bias (used 'completer' analysis). 6.Reporting bias due to selective outcome reporting (reporting bias). We checked if an a priori study protocol was available and if all outcomes of the study protocol were reported in the publications of the study. There is low risk of reporting bias if the study protocol is available and all of the study's pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review are reported in the pre-specified way, or if the study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that are pre- specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon). There is a high risk of reporting bias if not all of the study's pre- specified primary outcomes are reported; one or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that are not pre-specified; one or more reported primary outcomes are not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse eect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; the study report did not include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study. There is unclear risk of bias if insuicient information is available to permit judgement of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'. 7.Group similarity at baseline (selection bias). We assessed similarity of the study groups at baseline for the most important Cannabis-based medicines for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.9Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews prognostic clinical and demographic indicators. There is low risk of bias if groups are similar at baseline for demographic factors, value of main outcome measure(s), and important prognostic factors. There is an unclear risk of bias if important prognostic clinical and demographic indicators are not reported. There is high risk of bias if groups are not similar at baseline for demographic factors, value of main outcome measure(s), and important prognostic factors. 8.Size of study (checking for possible biases confounded by small size). We assessed studies as being at low risk of bias (200 participants or more per treatment arm); unclear risk of bias (50 to 199 participants per treatment arm); or high risk of bias (fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm). Two review authors (WH, FP) assessed the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We defined studies with zero to two unclear or high risks of bias to be high-quality studies, with three to five unclear or high risks of bias to be moderate-quality studies, and with six to eight unclear or high risks of bias to be low-quality studies (Schaefert 2015). Measures of treatment eect We calculated numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR; McQuay 1998 ). For unwanted eects, the NNTB becomes the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) and is calculated in the same manner. We used dichotomous data to calculate risk dierences (RD) with 95% CIs using a fixed- eect model unless we found significant statistical or clinical heterogeneity (see below). We set the threshold for a clinically relevant benefit or a clinically relevant harm for categorical variables by an NNTB or NNTH less than 10 (Moore 2008). We calculated standardised mean dierences (SMD) with 95% CIs for continuous variables using a fixed-eect model unless we found significant statistical or clinical heterogeneity. We used Cohen's categories to evaluate the magnitude of the eect size, calculated by SMD, with Hedges' g value of 0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, and 0.8 = large (Cohen 1988 ). We labelled a g value less than 0.2 to be a 'not substantial' eect size. We assumed a minimally important dierence if the Hedges' g value was 0.2 or greater (Fayers 2014). Unit of analysis issues We split the control treatment arm between active treatment arms in a single study if the active treatment arms were not combined for analysis. We included studies with a cross-over design where separate data from the two periods were reported, data were presented that excluded a statistically significant carry-over eect, or statistical adjustments were carried out in case of a significant carry-over eect. Dealing with missing data We used intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis where the ITT population consisted of participants who were randomised, took at least one dose of the assigned study medication, and provided at least one post-baseline assessment. Where means or standard deviations (SDs) were missing, we attempted to obtain these data through contacting trial authors.Where SDs were not available from trial authors, we calculated them from t values, P values, CIs, or standard errors, where reported by the studies (Higgins 2011b ). Where rates of pain relief of 30% and of 50% or greater were not reported or provided on request, we calculated them from means and SDs using a validated imputation method (Furukawa 2005). Assessment of heterogeneity We dealt with clinical heterogeneity by combining studies that examined similar conditions. We assessed statistical heterogeneity visually ( L'Abb\u00e9 1987), and using the I 2 statistic (Higgins 2003 ). When the I 2 value was greater than 50%, we considered possible reasons for this. Assessment of reporting biases We assessed publication bias using a method designed to detect the amount of unpublished data with a null eect required to make any result clinically irrelevant (usually taken to mean an NNTB of 10 or higher; Moore 2008). Data synthesis We intended to use a fixed-eect model for meta-analysis. We used a random-eects model using the inverse variance method in Review Manager 5 for meta-analysis (RevMan 2014) because there was significant clinical heterogeneity due to the dierent types of neuropathic pain conditions included. Quality of the evidence Two review authors (WH, FP) independently rated the quality of the outcomes. We used the GRADE system to rank the quality of the evidence using the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool so/f_tware (GRADEpro GDT 2015), and the guidelines provided in Chapter 12.2 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Sch\u00fcnemann 2011 ). The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of eect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The GRADE system uses the following criteria for assigning grade of evidence: 1.high: we are very confident that the true eect lies close to that of the estimate of the eect; 2.moderate: we are moderately confident in the eect estimate; the true eect is likely to be close to the estimate of eect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially dierent; 3.low: our confidence in the eect estimate is limited; the true eect may be substantially dierent from the estimate of the eect; 4.very low: we have very little confidence in the eect estimate; the true eect is likely to be substantially dierent from the estimate of eect. We decreased the grade rating by one (- 1) or two (- 2) if we identified: 1.serious (- 1) or very serious (- 2) limitation to study quality; 2.important inconsistency (- 1); 3.some (- 1) or major (- 2) uncertainty about directness; 4.imprecise or sparse data (- 1); Cannabis-based medicines for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.10Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 5.high probability of reporting bias (- 1). In addition, there may be circumstances where the overall rating for a particular outcome needs to be adjusted as recommended by GRADE guidelines (Guyatt 2013a). For example, if there are so few data that the results are highly susceptible to the random play of chance, or if a study uses last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation in circumstances where there are substantial dierences in adverse event withdrawals, one would have no confidence in the result, and would need to downgrade the quality of the evidence by three levels, to very low quality. In circumstances where there were no data reported for an outcome, we planned to report the level of evidence as very low quality (Guyatt 2013b). See also Appendix 3 : GRADE: criteria for assigning grade of evidence. 'Summary of findings' table We included one 'Summary of findings' table to present the main findings in a transparent and simple tabular format. In particular, we included key information concerning the quality of evidence, the magnitude of eect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on the outcomes. The 'Summary of findings' table includes the primary outcomes and the secondary outcomes of participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater, and nervous system disorders and psychiatric disorders as specific adverse events. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity We performed subgroup analyses according to individual neuropathic pain syndromes because placebo response rates for the same outcome can vary between conditions, as can the drug- specific eects (Moore 2013b). We performed subgroup analyses (dierent cannabis-based medicines; very short-term (less than four weeks), short-term (four to 12 weeks), intermediate-term (13 to 26 weeks), and long-term (more than 26 weeks) study duration)where there were at least two studies available. We post-hoc decided to perform subgroup analyses of studies with and without publication in peer-reviewed journals. We performed subgroup analyses if at least two studies for a subgroup were available. Sensitivity analysis We planned no sensitivity analysis because the evidence base is known to be too small to allow reliable analysis.

Study setting Five studies were conducted in the UK (Bermann 2004 ; Frank 2008; NCT01606176; Rog 2005; Selvarajah studies in Canada ( Lynch 2014; Toth 2012; Ware 2010), three studies in multiple European countries (Langford 2013; NCT00710424; Cannabis-based medicines for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Nine studies were single centre (Bermann 2004 ; Ellis 2009 ; Lynch Sample sizes The sample sizes ranged between 20 and 339. Study periods Study period was between 2000 and 2010 in seven studies (Bermann 2004 ; Frank 2014; Svendsen 2004; Ware 2010). The remaining studies did not report the study period. Study funding Three studies were funded by public funds (Ellis 2009 ; Selvarajah 2010; Ware 2010), one study reported that there was no external funding ( Lynch 2014), and the remaining studies were funded by the manufacturer of the drug. Four authors declared that they had no conflict of interest (Ellis 2009 ; Lynch 2014; Selvarajah 2010; Ware 2010). Six studies did not report interest (Bermann 2004; NCT00710424; NCT01606176; NCT01606202; Nurmikko 2007; Svendsen reported potential conflicts of interest by honoraria and/or funding received by the manufacturer of the drug studied (Frank 2008; Langford 2013; Rog 2005; Schimrigk 2017 ; Serpell 2014 ; Toth 2012). Characteristics of the participants Types of neuropathic pain Five studies included participants with neuropathic pain associated with multiple sclerosis (Langford 2013; NCT01606176; Rog 2005; Schimrigk 2017 ; Svendsen 2004), three pain of various aetiologies (Nurmikko 2007; Serpell 2014; Selvarajah 2010; Toth 2012), and one study with plexus injury (Bermann 2004 ), one study with spinal cord injury (NCT01606202), one study with HIV-neuropathy (Ellis 2009 ), one study with chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy (Lynch 2014), and one study with mixed central or peripheral pain of various aetiologies (Frank 2008). Demographics The mean age of the participants ranged between 34 and 61 years. The youngest mean age was in the studies with medical cannabis (Ellis 2009 ; Ware 2010). The percentage of men ranged between 17% and 100%. Inclusion criteria Nine studies required a pain score of 4 or above on a zero to 10 scale at baseline for inclusion (Bermann 2004 ; Ellis 2009 ; Frank 2008; The remaining studies did not report on an inclusion criterion of a defined pain intensity. Five studies required for inclusion that the pain was refractory to previous analgesics without specifying the type and dosage ofprevious unsuccessful analgesic therapy (Ellis 2009 ; Langford 2013; NCT00710424; NCT01606176; Ware 2010). Exclusion criteria All studies excluded people with major medical diseases (heart, liver, kidney, seizures). Ten studies mentioned explicitly that they excluded people with a history of substance abuse (Bermann 2004 ; Ellis 2009 ; Frank 2008; of participants with herbal cannabis Nine studies reported previous herbal cannabis experience of participants for medical and/or recreational use (Bermann 2004 ; Ellis 2009 ; Langford 2007; Rog 2005; Selvarajah 2010; Serpell 2014 ; Ware 2010). The percentage of participants with previous herbal cannabis experience ranged from 7% to 91%. Of note, the rates of previous herbal cannabis experience were the highest in the two studies with inhaled cannabis, with 91% in Ellis 2009 and 81% in Ware 2010. One study excluded people who had used marijuana in the month before study entry (Schimrigk 2017 ). Characteristics of the treatment delivered Types of cannabis-based medicines All studies used THC/CBD oromucosal spray except two studies that used oral synthetic THC (nabilone) (Frank 2008; Toth ; Svendsen 2004 Schimrigk 2017 and two studies that used inhaled (by pipe or cigarette) herbal cannabis (Ellis 2009 ; Ware 2010). All studies compared to placebo except one study that compared to dihydrocodeine (DHC) (Frank 2008). Rescue and Co-medication Two studies (Bermann 2004 ; Nurmikko 2007) did not allow rescue medication. Five studies used paracetamol (Frank 2008; Langford 2013; NCT01606202; Serpell study tramadol (Schimrigk 2017 ). The remaining studies did not report details on rescue medication (Ellis 2009 ; Lynch 2014; NCT00710424; NCT01606176; Rog 2005; Selvarajah 2010; Toth co-medications were allowed (NCT00710424; NCT01606176; Selvarajah 2010; Toth 2012). The remaining studies allowed stable dosage of analgesic co- medications. Excluded studies We excluded 15 studies for the following reasons: five studies because no definite statement was given that the pain was of neuropathic nature (Corey-Bloom Zajicek 2012); five studies because the study duration was less than two weeks (Abrams 2007; Karst 2003; Wallace 2015; Wilsey 2013; Wilsey 2008). one because the reports of the outcomes of eicacy did not meet the predefined inclusion criteria for eicacy (Zajicek 2003), two studies because there were fewer than 10 participants per treatment arm (Rintala 2010; Turcotte 2015), and one study each because participants with non-neuropathic pain were included (Notcutt 2011) and participants without pain were included ( Wade 2003).

Blinding of outcome assessor Blinding of outcome assessment for adverse events was only adequately described by Nurmikko 2007 and Rog 2005. The remaining studies did not adequately describe it (unclear risk of bias). Incomplete outcome data Only one study performed intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis by baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) method (Svendsen 2004). Three studies performed completer analysis (Frank 2008; Selvarajah 2010; Ware 2010) (high risk of bias). The remaining studies performed ITT by last observation carried forward (LOCF) method and were therefore of unclear risk of bias. Selective reporting Two studies were of high risk of bias because they did not report all predefined outcomes (Ellis 2009 ; Selvarajah 2010). Four studies did not report on a study protocol and were therefore of unclear risk of bias ( Bermann 2004 ; Lynch 2014; Svendsen 2004; Toth 2012). The remaining studies reported the outcomes as defined in a study protocol. Other potential sources of bias Group similarity at baseline All studies had a low risk of bias because there were no significant dierences in demographic and clinical variables at baseline except one study with a high risk of bias (Toth 2012). Sample size Sample size was of unclear risk of bias in seven studies (Frank 2008; of high risk of bias in nine studies (Bermann 2004 ; Ellis 2009 ; See: Summary of findings 1 Cannabis-based medicines compared with placebo for chronic neuropathic pain All cannabis-based medicines versus placebo - studies with a cross-over and parallel design See Summary of findings 1. Primary outcomes The quailty of evidence was downgraded by one level due to indirectness (people with current or historical substance abuse, or both, and major medical diseases excluded) for all outcomes.Participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater We analysed eight studies with 1001 participants. One hundred and 10 of 526 (20.9%) participants in the cannabis-based medicines and 82 of 475 (17.3%) participants in the placebo group reported pain relief of 50% or greater (risk dierence (RD) 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.09); P value 0.04; I/two.sups = 29%). NNTB was 20 (11 to 100). According to the predefined categories, there was no clinically relevant benefit of cannabis-based medicines (see Analysis 1.1 ). The quality of evidence was low, downgraded due to indirectness and imprecision (CI included zero). Patient Global Impression of Change much or very much improved We analysed six studies with 1092 participants. One hundred and fi/f_ty-six of 548 (28.4%) participants in the cannabis-based medicines and 112 of 544 (22.1%) participants in the placebo group reported to be much or very much improved (RD 0.09 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.17; P value 0.02; I/two.sups = 58%). The NNTB was 11 (6 to 100). According to the predefined categories, there was no clinically relevant benefit of cannabis-based medicines (see Analysis 1.2 ). The quality of evidence was very low, downgraded due to indirectness, inconsistency (I/two.sups>50%) and publication bias (all studies funded by the manufacturer of the drug). Withdrawals due to adverse events We analysed 13 studies with 1848 participants. One hundred and three of 989 (10.4%) participants in the cannabis-based medicines and 40 of 859 (4.7%) participants in the placebo group withdrew due to adverse events (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.07; P value 0.0009; I/two.sups = 25%). The NNTH was 25 (16 to 50). According to the predefined categories there was no clinically relevant harm by cannabis-based medicines (see Analysis 1.3 ). The quality of evidence was moderate, downgraded due to indirectness. Serious adverse events We analysed 13 studies with 1876 participants. Sity-six of 989 (6.7%) participants in the cannabis-based medicines and 46 of 887 (5.2%) participants in the placebo group reported serious adverse events (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; P value 0.29; I/two.sups = 0%) (see Analysis 1.4 ). The quality of evidence was low, downgraded due to indirectness and imprecision (CI included zero; low number of events). Secondary outcomes Participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater We analysed 10 studies with 1586 participants. Three hundred and twenty-three of 819 (39.4%) participants in the cannabis-based medicines and 251 of 767 (32.7%) participants in the placebo group reported pain relief of 30% or greater (RD 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.15; P value 0.004; I/two.sups = 34%). NNTB was 11 (7 to 33). According to the predefined categories, there was no clinically relevant benefit by cannabis-based medicines (see Analysis 1.5 ). The quality of evidence was moderate, downgraded due to indirectness. Mean pain intensity We analysed 14 studies with 1837 participants. Cannabis-based medicines were superior to placebo in the reduction of mean pain intensity (standardised mean dierence (SMD) = 84%). According to Cohen's categories, there was a small eect size indicating a minimal clinically important improvement (see Analysis 1.6 ).

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was low, downgraded due to indirectness and inconsistency (I/two.sups>50%). Health-related quality of life We analysed nine studies with 1284 participants. Cannabis-based medicines were not superior to placebo in the improvement of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (SMD 0.02, 95% 0.13; I/two.sups = 0%) (see Analysis 1.7 ). The quality of evidence was low, downgraded due to indirectness and inconsistency (CI included zero). Sleep problems We analysed eight studies with 1386 participants. Cannabis-based medicines were superior to placebo in the reduction of sleep problems (SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.90 to = 92%). According to Cohen's categories, there was a small eect size indicating a minimal clinically important improvement (see Analysis 1.8 ). The quality of evidence was low, downgraded due to indirectness and inconsistency (I/two.sups>50%). Fatigue The analysis was not possible because fatigue was assessed only by one study (Langford 2013). Psychological distress We analysed seven studies with 779 participants. Cannabis-based medicines were statistically significantly superior to placebo in the reduction of psychological distress (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.61 to = 66%). According to Cohen's categories, there was a small eect size indicating a minimal clinically important improvement (see Analysis 1.9 ). The quality of evidence was low, downgraded due to indirectness and inconsistency (I/two.sups>50%). Withdrawals due to lack of eicacy We analysed nine studies with 1576 participants. There was no dierence in the frequency of withdrawals due to lack of eicacy between cannabis-based medicines and placebo. Twenty-two of 818 (2.7%) participants in the cannabis-based medicines and 31 of 758 (4.1%) participants in the placebo group withdrew due to lack of eicacy (RD -0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01; I/two.sups = 0%) (see Analysis 1.10 ). The quality of evidence was low, downgraded due to indirectness and imprecision (CI included zero). Any adverse event We analysed seven studies with 1356 participants. Five hundred and sixty-two of 684 (80.2%) participants in the cannabis-based medicines and 441 of 672 (65.6%) participants in the placebo group reported adverse events (RD 0.19, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; P value < 0.0001; I/two.sups = 64%). NNTH was 5 (4 to 8). According to the predefined categories, there was a clinically relevant harm by cannabis-based medicines (see Analysis 1.11 ). The quality of evidence was low, downgraded due to indirectness and inconsistency (I/two.sups>50%). Specific adverse events Nervous system disorders We analysed nine studies with 1304 participants. Four hundred and fourteen of 677 (61.1%) participants in the cannabis-based medicines and 180 of 627 (28.7%) participants in the placebo group reported adverse events of the nervous system (RD 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.58; P NNTH was 3 (2 to6). According to the predefined categories, there was a clinically relevant harm by cannabis-based medicines (see Analysis 1.12 ). The quality of evidence was low, downgraded due to indirectness and inconsistency (I/two.sups>50%). Psychiatric disorders We analysed nine studies with 1314 participants. One hundred and twelve of 677 (16.5%) participants in the cannabis-based medicines and 31 of 637 (4.9%) participants in the placebo group reported psychiatric adverse events (RD 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.15; P value < 0.0001; I/two.sups = 54%). NNTH was 10 (7 to 16). According to the predefined categories, there was no clinically relevant harm by cannabis-based medicines (see Analysis 1.13 ). The quality of evidence was low, downgraded due to indirectness and inconsistency (I/two.sups>50%). Cannabis-based medicines versus placebo - studies with an enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal design (results of double-blind phase) We present a qualitative analysis of the study results (Langford 2013; Toth 2012) because the data were not suited for quantitative analysis. The quality of evidence for each outcome was very low, downgraded because of indirectness (people with current or historical substance abuse, or both, and major medical diseases excluded), imprecision (low number of events) and publication bias (all studies funded by manufacturer of the drug). Primary outcomes Participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater We analysed one study with 26 participants. There was no dierence between nabilone and placebo in the number of participants with a 50% pain relief or greater (31% versus 8%; P value 0.12). We analysed one study with 42 participants. There was a dierence between THC/CBD and placebo in the number of participants with a treatment failure (24% versus 57%; P value 0.04). Patient Global Impression of Change much or very much improved We analysed one study with 26 participants. Six of 13 participants in the nabilone and one of 13 participants in the placebo group reported to be much or very much improved (P value 0.04). Withdrawals due to adverse events We analysed two studies with 68 participants. There was no dierence between cannabis-based medicines and placebo. None of the 21 participants dropped out of the THC/CBD spray group and one of 21 dropped out of the placebo group. None dropped out in the nabilone (13 participants) or placebo (13 participants) groups. Serious adverse events We analysed two studies with 68 participants. There was no dierence between cannabis-based medicines and placebo. Three of 21 participants experienced a serious adverse event in the THC/ CBD spray and one of 21 in the placebo group. None experienced a serious adverse event in the nabilone (13 participants) or placebo (13 participants) group.

Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Secondary outcomes Participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater We analysed one study with 26 participants. There was a dierence between nabilone and placebo in the number of participants with pain relief of 30% or greater (85% versus 38%; P value 0.006). Mean pain intensity We analysed two studies with 68 participants. The estimated treatment dierence between THC/CBD spray and placebo was -0.79 (P value 0.03). The average pain intensity was 3.5 \u00b1 1.3 in the nabilone and 5.4 \u00b1 1.7 in the placebo group (P value 0.005) (higher scores indicate more pain). Health-related quality of life We analysed two studies with 68 participants. The estimated treatment dierence between THC/CBD spray and placebo was 1.94 (P value 0.18) in one study. The HRQoL score was 0.74 \u00b1 0.03 in the nabilone and 0.60 \u00b1 0.8 in the placebo group (P value < 0.05) in one study (higher scores indicating a better HRQoL). Sleep problems We analysed two studies with 68 participants. The estimated treatment dierence between THC/CBD spray and placebo was -0.99 (P value 0.02). The sleep problems score was 27.1 \u00b1 2.1 in the nabilone and 33.0 \u00b1 2.6 in the placebo group (P value < 0.05) (higher scores indicate more sleep problems). Fatigue Neither of these studies assessed this outcome. Psychological distress We analysed one study with 42 participants. The estimated treatment dierence between THC/CBD spray and placebo was -0.56 (P value 0.73). Withdrawals due to lack of eicacy We analysed one study with 42 participants. None of the participants in the THC/CBD study dropped out due to lack of eicacy. Any adverse event We analysed two studies with 68 participants. Ten per cent of participants with THC/CBD spray and 24% of participants with placebo reported an adverse event. Fi/f_ty-four per cent of the participants receiving nabilone and 46% of the participants receiving placebo reported at least one adverse event (P value 1.0). Specific adverse events Nervous system disorders We analysed one study with 42 participants. None of the participants in the THC/CBD group reported adverse events of the nervous system. Psychiatric disorders We analysed one study with 42 participants. Five per cent of participants in both groups reported a psychiatric adverse event.Cannabis-based medicines versus any active other drug Only one study compared nabilone with dihydrocodeine (DHC) in 73 participants (Frank 2008). We therefore present a qualitative analysis of the study results. The quality of evidence for each outcome was very low, downgraded because of indirectness (people with current or historical substance abuse, and major medical diseases excluded), imprecision (low number of events) and publication bias (all studies funded by manufacturer of the drug). Primary outcomes Participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater Frank 2008 assessed this outcome, however the study authors reported only the mean pain intensity. Patient Global Impression of Change much or very much improved Frank 2008 did not assess this outcome. Withdrawals due to adverse events There was no dierence between nabilone and DHC. Four of 96 participants dropped out in the nabilone group and 8/96 in the DHC group (P value 0.23). Serious adverse events No major adverse events occurred when participants took either drug. Secondary outcomes Participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater Frank 2008 assessed this outcome, however the study authors reported only the mean pain intensity. Mean pain intensity There was no dierence reported). Health-related quality of life There was no dierence between nabilone and DHC with a treatment dierence of 8.9 (P value 0.48). Sleep problems There was no dierence between nabilone and DHC with a treatment dierence of 0.2 (P value 0.28). Fatigue Frank 2008 did not assess this outcome. Psychological distress There was no dierence between nabilone and DHC with a treatment dierence of 2.5 (P value 0.35). Withdrawals due to lack of eicacy Frank 2008 did not assess this outcome. Any adverse event There were 334 adverse events reported in the nabilone and 305 in the DHC group (no dierence).

Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Specific adverse events Nervous system disorders This outcome was not assessed. Psychiatric disorders This outcome was not assessed. Assessment of publication bias The planned assessment of publication bias was not possible because the NNTB of all cannabis-based medicines pooled together versus placebo for all dichotomous primary and secondary outcomes surpassed the pre-set level of an NNTB of 10 or less. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity We post-hoc decided to restrict subgroup analyses to the outcomes pain relief of 50% or greater, PGIC (Patient Global Impression of Change) much or very much improved, withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events and mean pain intensity. A subgroup analysis was only performed with at least two studies available. Dierent types of neuropathic pain syndromes We excluded studies with mixed samples of central and/or peripheral neuropathic pain from subgroup analysis because we wanted to assess the eects of cannabis-based medicines on distinctive neuropathic pain syndromes. We found no subgroup dierence between dierent types of neuropathic pain syndromes in the outcomes pain relief of 50% or greater (P value 0.20), withdrawals due to adverse events (P value 0.13), serious adverse events (P value 0.97), and mean pain intensity (P value 0.46). There was a subgroup dierence between dierent types of neuropathic pain syndromes in the outcome PGIC (P value 0.02). Dierent types of cannabis-based medicines Participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater THC/CBD oromucosal spray was not dierent to placebo. RD was 0.05 (95% CI -0.00 to 0.11) (P value 0.07) (seven studies with 737 participants. Dronabinol (two studies with 264 participants) was not dierent to placebo. RD was 0.05 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.15) (P value 0.31) This outcome could not be analysed for herbal cannabis. Patient Global Impression of Change much or very much improved THC/CBD oromucosal spray (six studies with 1092 participants) was superior to placebo. RD was 0.09 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.17) (P value 0.02). The trials with dronabinol and herbal cannabis did not report this outcome. Withdrawals due to adverse events THC/CBD oromucosal spray (nine studies with 1408 participants) was superior to placebo.

Studies with high and unclear risk of bias due to sample size Five of the 10 studies that reported the outcome 30% or more pain relief had treatment group sizes below 50 participants and we considered them at high risk of bias. Analysis of these five studies with 328 participants (24% of the total) showed an RD for pain relief of 30% or greater of 0.17 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.27); 40% of participants reported this outcome with cannabis-based medicines and 26% with placebo. Five of the 10 studies that reported the outcome 30% or more pain relief had treatment group sizes above 50 but below 200 participants and we considered them at unclear risk of bias. Analysis of these four studies with 1018 participants (76% of the total) showed an RD for pain relief of 30% or greater of 0.05 (95% CI -0.00 to 0.11); 41% of participants reported this outcome with cannabis-based medicines and 37% with placebo.Heterogeneity I/two.sups was less than 50% except for Patient Global Impression of Change (I/two.sups = 58%), mean pain intensity (I/two.sups = 55%), sleep problems (I/two.sups = 92%), psychological distress (I/two.sups = 66%), any adverse event (I/two.sups = 64%), nervous system disorders as adverse event (I/two.sups = 94%) and psychiatric disorders as adverse event (I/two.sups = 54%). We did not find clinical explanations for heterogeneity. D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results We included 16 studies, 2 to 26 weeks long, with 1750 participants. All studies compared cannabis-based medicines with placebo except one study that compared synthetic THC with dihydrocodeine (DHC). Studies compared an oromucosal spray with a plant-derived combination of THC and CBD (10 studies), inhaled herbal cannabis (two studies), synthetic THC (nabilone) (two studies) and plant-derived THC (dronabinol) (two studies). All cannabis-based medicines (at any dose) pooled together were superior to placebo for substantial (50% and more) (low- quality evidence) and moderate (30% and more) pain relief (moderate-quality evidence), for global improvement (very low- quality evidence), and in reduction of mean pain intensity (low- quality evidence), sleep problems (low-quality evidence), and psychological distress (low-quality evidence). The eect sizes of mean pain intensity, sleep problems and psychological distress were clinically relevant. There was moderate-quality evidence that more people dropped out due to adverse events with cannabis- based medicines compared to placebo. There was low-quality evidence that more people reported any adverse event and adverse events of the central nervous system and psychiatric disorders with all cannabis-based medicines pooled together than with placebo. The eect size of adverse events of the nervous system disorders was clinically relevant. There was no dierence between all cannabis-based medicines pooled together and placebo in the frequency of serious adverse events (low-quality evidence), for improvement of health-related quality of life (low-quality evidence) and dropouts due to lack of eicacy (moderate-quality evidence). There was no high-quality evidence suggesting that any cannabis- based medicine (herbal cannabis, THC/CBD oromucosal spray, synthetic or plant-based THC) was of value in treating people with chronic neuropathic pain. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence The overall completeness and applicability of the evidence were poor. The usefulness of the available evidence was limited because reporting quality was poor by current standards (Moore 2010a). The reliability of the pooled results in general and of findings on nabilone in particular was limited because the results of three studies with nabilone have not been published and the results were not provided by the study authors on request (NCT00699634; NCT01035281; NCT01222468). The applicability of the evidence to routine clinical care was limited because all the included studies excluded people with current or historical substance abuse, or both, and major medical diseases. Cannabis-based medicines for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.20Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Quality of the evidence We found the evidence for most outcomes to be low quality because of indirectness (people with major medical disorders excluded) and inconsistent results. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of eect and is likely to change the estimate. In addition, we found signs of publication bias. We found three industry-sponsored studies of THC/CBD spray with negative results, which have not been fully published yet. We also found three studies of nabilone but the results were unknown; the study authors did not respond to our requests. Despite growing requirements for trial registration, full access to clinical trial data remains elusive (Mintzes 2015). Six studies reviewed used a cross-over design with a study duration between one to two weeks for each period, and cross-over designs have methodological issues that could lead to bias (Elbourne 2002 ). The short study duration limits their applicability. In addition, there are issues about the time needed (if any) for washout between treatment periods. Poor reporting limits their use in meta-analysis, possibly with some biases ( Moore 2013b). A large number of participants (7% to 91%) in the studies were former cannabis users. No subgroup comparisons (former cannabis users versus cannabis-naive participants) were conducted by any study. A prospective observational study found that the rate of non-serious adverse events among current cannabis users was lower than that among ex-cannabis users or naive users (Ware 2015).Therefore we do not know if the study results on eicacy and safety of the RCTs reviewed are valid for cannabis-naive participants. People with chronic neuropathic pain exhibit a variety of pain- related sensory symptoms and findings (Baron 2017). They use dierent descriptors for their pain (e.g. burning, tugging, pricking, cramping). None of the neuropathic pain scales available cover all potential descriptors of neuropathic pain (Thyson 2014 ). Eight of the studies reviewed used a neuropathic pain scale. However, none of the studies reported the eects of cannabis-based medicines on the single dimensions of the neuropathic pain scales used. A recent study with botulinum toxin in peripheral neuropathic pain demonstrated a statistically significant eect on paroxysmal pain, but not on burning and deep pain (Attal 2016). Therefore we do not know the eicacy of cannabis-based medicines for specific qualities of neuropathic pain. Perhaps the biggest issue is that of the relatively small size of the studies. Nine of the 16 studies were at high risk of bias because of small size. There are issues over both random chance eects with small amounts of data, and potential bias in small studies, especially in pain (Dechartes 2013; Dechartres have been criticised for perhaps over-emphasising results of underpowered studies or analyses (AlBalawi 2013 ; Turner 2013). On the other hand, it may be unethical to ignore potentially important information from small studies or to randomise more participants if a meta- analysis including small, existing studies provided conclusive evidence. In this review, we chose to limit analyses to studies with a minimum of 10 participants per treatment group. Small studies may have influenced positive results in this review. For example, for moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief), the overall result was positive with an RD of 0.09 (0.03 to 0.15) in an analysis of 10 studies with 1566 participants, but the dierence betweencannabis-based medicines and placebo was much larger in small studies. We had not initially planned this analysis, but examination of the forest plots demonstrated that for this and other outcomes, the elimination of small studies eliminated statistical significance. In view of the accumulating evidence regarding potential bias in small studies, the quality of the evidence for cannabis-based medicines for treating neuropathic pain cannot be relied upon. Potential biases in the review process The absence of publication bias (unpublished trials showing no benefit of cannabis-based medicines over placebo) can never be proved. We carried out a broad search for studies and feel it is unlikely that significant amounts of relevant data remain unknown to us. We might have overestimated the risk of bias of some studies that did not report some details of methodology (e.g. randomisation and blinding procedures). Most studies selected statistical methods (last observation carried forward, completer analysis) that bias results towards exaggerating the eicacy of drugs (Moore 2013b). The influence of allowed co-interventions (e.g. rescue medication) on positive eects and adverse events was unclear because type and dosage of co-interventions were not clearly reported or controlled for. This systematic review included 1750 participants. To capture rare and potentially severe adverse events a larger data set would have been necessary. For example, to capture an adverse event with a frequency of 1:100,000, 300,000 participants' observations would have been necessary (Andersohn 2008). Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews We cannot share the optimistic conclusions of some reviews that cannabis-based medicines are eective, well-tolerated and safe in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain (Andreae 2015; Boychuk 2015; Lynch 2011). Lynch 2011 performed a qualitative systematic review on cannabis-based medicines in chronic non-cancer pain with 11 studies in chronic neuropathic pain and concluded that cannabis-based medicines are \"modestly\" eective in neuropathic pain and did not lead to withdrawal from the study. Boychuk 2015 performed a qualitative analysis of 13 studies of cannabis-based medicines in 771 participants with chronic neuropathic pain and concluded that cannabis-based medicines should be considered as an alternative treatment for neuropathic pain. The authors made no definitive statement on tolerability and safety. Andreae 2015 performed an individual participant data analysis of 178 participants from five studies of inhaled cannabis. They calculated an NNTB of 6 (95% CI 3 to 14) for a more than 30% reduction in pain scores compared to placebo. Withdrawals due to adverse events were found to be rare. The dierences to our rather cautious conclusions on the eicacy, tolerability and safety of cannabis- based medicines in chronic neuropathic pain can be explained as follows. 1.We performed a quantitative analysis, which included unpublished studies with negative results. The authors of the above-mentioned reviews did not include the data of studies that are only available in databases. Cannabis-based medicines for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.21Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2.We excluded studies of very short-term duration. Andreae 2015; Boychuk 2015 and Lynch 2011 included two, one-day studies (Wilsey 2013; Wilsey 2008), which we excluded because of short study duration. The European Medicines Agency requires that study duration for chronic neuropathic pain trials should be at least 12 weeks a/f_ter a stable dose is achieved in order to exclude a transient eect (European Medicines Agency 2007). 3.We excluded studies that did not explicitly state that the pain was of neuropathic nature. This exclusion criterion was applied to some large studies in people with multiple sclerosis with spasticity as a major outcome. There is moderate-quality evidence for the eicacy of cannabis-based medicines to reduce spasticity symptoms (Whiting 2015 ; Zettl 2016). However, spasticity-associated pain should not be mixed with central neuropathic pain (Koppel 2014). 4.We performed a detailed analysis of adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events. On the other hand, our analyses do not support the conclusions of the Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain (NeuPSIG) of the International Association for the Study of Pain that cannabis-based medicines are not eective in chronic neuropathic pain (Finnerup 2015). Our result that the use of cannabis-based medicines is associated with an increased risk of short-term adverse events, especially of the central nervous system, is in accordance with a systematic review of Whiting 2015 who analysed eight trials of cannabis-based medicines in chronic neuropathic pain. We did not find a long-term RCT with cannabis-based medicines answering the question of long-term eicacy and safety. One study with dronabinol included in the review added a 32-week, open- label extension period to the randomised controlled period. The study authors reported that, during long-term follow-up, pain intensities remained at a low level (range 2.5 to 3.8 of a 0 to 10 scale). The number of adverse events and dropouts due to adverse events was lower in the long-term than in the randomised-controlled period. \"Mild signs\" of drug dependency were documented for one participant (Schimrigk 2017 ). THC/CBD oromucosal spray was investigated in a 38-week, open-label extension study. Three hundred and eighty participants with polyneuropathy associated with diabetes or allodynia entered this study from two previous RCTs. Participants received THC/CBD spray for a further 38 weeks in addition to their current analgesic therapy. The proportion of participants who reported at least a clinically relevant 30% improvement in pain continued to increase with time (up to nine months); at least half of all participants reported a 30% improvement at all time points. Improvements were observed for all secondary eicacy outcomes, including sleep quality, Patient Global Impression of Change and HRQoL. THC/CBD spray was well tolerated for the study duration and participants did not seek to increase their dose with time, with no new safety concerns arising from long-term use (Hoggart 2015). A U T H O R S ' /uni00A0 C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice For people with chronic neuropathic pain There is no high-quality evidence for the eicacy of any cannabis- based product including herbal cannabis (marijuana) in any condition with chronic neuropathic pain. Some adverse events (particularly somnolence or sedation, confusion, psychosis) maylimit the clinical usefulness of cannabis-based medicines. It might be expected that, at best, a few people with neuropathic pain will benefit from long-term use of cannabis-based medicines. Some current clinical guidelines and systematic reviews consider cannabis-based medicines as third- or fourth-line therapy for chronic neuropathic pain syndromes if established therapies (e.g. anticonvulsants, antidepressants) have failed (Moulin 2014 ; Petzke 2016). For physicians There is no high-quality evidence for the eicacy of any cannabis- any condition with chronic neuropathic pain. Some adverse events (particularly somnolence or sedation, confusion, psychosis) may limit the clinical usefulness of cannabis-based medicines. It might be expected that, at best, a few people with neuropathic pain will benefit from long-term use of cannabis-based medicines. Since relatively few participants achieve a worthwhile response with cannabis-based medicines, decisions to use these medicines may require stopping rules to avoid the unnecessary exposure to harms in the absence of benefit. . The Canadian Pain Society recommended cannabis-based medicines as third-line therapy for chronic neuropathic pain syndromes if established therapies (e.g. anticonvulsants, antidepressants) had failed (Moulin 2014 ). The Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain (NeuPSIG) for the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain gave a weak recommendation against the use of cannabis-based medicines (Finnerup 2015 ). The status of approval of cannabis-based medicines and reimbursement by health insurance companies for chronic pain diers from country to country (Ablin 2016 ; Krcevski-Skvarc 2018). For policy-makers There is no high-quality evidence suggesting that cannabis- plant-derived THC/CBD of value in treating people with chronic neuropathic pain. This needs to be explained to people requesting this treatment in jurisdictions where it is allowed, e.g. Canada, Germany and Israel. The license of cannabis-based medicines including herbal cannabis for people with chronic (neuropathic) pain is scheduled for some countries. A patient register to document the eicacy and risks of cannabis-based medicines financed by public funds is preferable. In the absence of high-quality evidence of benefit, the use of cannabis-based medicines at the discretion of a pain specialist with particular expertise in use of cannabis-based medicines is desirable. Cannabis-based medicines are no first-line treatment of any condition with chronic neuropathic pain. For funders Since no single treatment is eective in a majority of individuals with chronic neuropathic pain, this relatively small number of people with neuropathic pain who benefit from cannabis-based medicines may be considered worthwhile, particularly if switching rules are in place. The treatment should be supervised by a pain specialist. Cannabis-based medicines for chronic neuropathic pain in adults (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.22Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Implications for research General There may be dierences in eect of dierent cannabis-based medicines in dierent types of neuropathic pain. The optimal ratio of THC/CBD still needs to be determined. In addition, pure CBD products or the development of peripherally acting cannabinoid agonists may reduce central nervous system and psychiatric adverse events. To be certain of a result in terms of both direction and magnitude of eect would require very large clinical trials. These trials would need to have important design features. 1.Chronic neuropathic pain conditions that have not been included in previous trials, such as post-stroke pain, need to be studied. 2.Study duration with a minimum of three months is recommended. 3.In those clinical conditions for which there is an established treatment option, a three-arm study (study drug - standard drug treatment- placebo) is desirable, in order to allow the assessment of comparative eicacy and safety. 4.Outcomes of clinical utility, such as moderate and substantial benefit using neuropathic pain scales and Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC), are recommended. 5.Imputation method are to be abandoned, as the outcome desired is that of adequate pain relief in the longer term, and for that people have to continue on therapy. Withdrawal for any reason has to be classified as treatment failure. 6.It is preferable that the study protocol defines that treating people with cannabis-based medicines who do not have pain relief is unacceptable, so that there would be built-in stopping rules linked to pain relief a/f_ter an adequate trial of therapy. 7.It is valuable to design and analyse studies whether there are any predisposing features linked with treatment success or failure. 8.Study data have to be made available for review authors for individual participant data analyses. 9.Reporting the details of the assessment of adverse events (spontaneous reports, open questions, symptom questionnaires) is mandatory because the type and frequency of adverse events is influenced by the modes of assessment (H\u00e4user 2012 ). Adverse events have to be reported using the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, and coded within organ classes using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (International Council for Harmonisation 2016). It is desirable that regulatory agencies standardise the assessment strategies of adverse events in randomised controlled trials.Design The key question is whether there are any people with neuropathic pain who do well on cannabis-based medicines in the long term; that is, with a substantial reduction in pain and/or improvement of daily functioning maintained and tolerable adverse events. An alternative to clinical trials might be the use of registry studies. Measurement (endpoints) Reporting of average pain changes is inadequate, and the use of responder analyses (pain relief of 50% or greater or participants experiencing mild or no pain) is preferred. The contextual details (e.g. type of pain (average, worst, least, current), time period to be rated, location of pain) of their administration are typically not standardised, nor well- reported in the literature, resulting in trial results that are challenging to interpret. In an eort to standardise pain intensity assessment. The Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION) public-private partnership has developed a training system for participants in clinical trials using a zero to 10 numerical rating scale (NRS) to rate pain intensity (Smith 2016 ). The use of validated neuropathic pain scales and the reports of the eects of cannabis-based medicines on all items of the neuropathic pain scale are recommended. In addition, a subgrouping of participants with neuropathic syndromes based on sensory profiles is possible and may be useful in clinical trial design to enrich the study population for treatment responders (Baron 2017). Long-term studies aiming to capture data on misuse and abuse of cannabis-based medicines and cannabis-induced mental disorders are valuable.

Study design: EERW Study duration: all participants who experienced at least a 30% reduction in their weekly mean pain score during the 4-week, single-blind flexible dosing phase considered a responder, and fur- ther continued in the study. During the double-blind portion of the study, participants randomised to nabilone continued on the dose of nabilone achieved at the completion of the single-blind phase, and this dose was maintained throughout the double-blind phase. Participants randomised to placebo received 1 mg of nabilone daily for 1 week, followed by 4 consecutive weeks of place- bo. This dose of nabilone permitted a tapering for those participants achieving a higher daily dose of nabilone during the single-blind phase, or maintained those who were taking only 1 mg/d in the single-blind phase, preventing an abrupt termination of treatment in participants who were ran- domised into the placebo portion.

Methodological considerations for chronic pain There have been several recent changes in how the eicacy of conventional and unconventional treatments is assessed in chronic painful conditions. The outcomes are now better defined, particularly with new criteria for what constitutes moderate or substantial benefit (Dworkin 2008); older trials may only report participants with 'any improvement'. Newer trials tend to be larger, avoiding problems from the random play of chance. Newer trials also tend to be of longer duration, up to 12 weeks, and longer trials provide a more rigorous and valid assessment of eicacy in chronic conditions. New standards have evolved for assessing eicacy in neuropathic pain, and we are now applying stricter criteria for the inclusion of trials and assessment of outcomes, and are more aware of problems that may aect our overall assessment. Below we have summarised some of the recent insights that must be considered in this new review. 1.Pain results tend to have a U-shaped distribution rather than a bell-shaped distribution. This is true in acute pain (Moore 2011a; Moore 2011b), back pain (Moore 2010c), and arthritis ( Moore 2010d), as well as in fibromyalgia (Straube 2010); in all cases average results usually describe the experience of almost no-one in the trial. Data expressed as averages are potentially misleading, unless they can be proven to be suitable. 2.As a consequence, we have to depend on dichotomous results (the individual either has or does not have the outcome) usually from pain changes or patient global assessments. The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) group has helped with their definitions of minimal, moderate, and substantial improvement (Dworkin 2008). In arthritis, trials of less than 12 weeks' duration, and especially those shorter than eight weeks, overestimate the eect of treatment (Moore 2010c); the eect is particularly strong for less eective analgesics, and this may also be relevant in neuropathic-type pain. 3.The proportion of patients with at least moderate benefit can be small, even with an eective medicine, falling from 60% with an eective medicine in arthritis to 30% in fibromyalgia (Moore 2009; 2010c; Moore 2010d; Moore A Cochrane Review of pregabalin in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia demonstrated dierent response rates for dierent types of chronic pain (higher in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia and lower in central pain and fibromyalgia) (Moore 2009). This indicates that dierent neuropathic pain conditions should be treated separately from one another, and that pooling should not be done unless there are good grounds for doing so. 4.Individual patient analyses indicate that patients who get good pain relief (moderate or better) have major benefits in many other outcomes, aecting quality of life in a significant way (Moore 2010b; Moore 2014a). 5.Imputation methods such as last observation carried forward (LOCF), used when participants withdraw from clinical trials, can overstate drug eicacy especially when adverse event withdrawals with drug are greater than those with placebo (Moore 2012).

GRADE: criteria for assigning grade of evidence The GRADE system uses the following criteria for assigning a quality level to a body of evidence (Chapter 12, Sch\u00fcnemann 2011 ). 1.High: downgraded observational studies; or case series/case reports Factors that may decrease the quality level of a body of evidence are: 1.limitations in the design and implementation of available studies suggesting high likelihood of bias; 2.indirectness of evidence (indirect population, intervention, control, outcomes); 3.unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results (including problems with subgroup analyses); 4.imprecision of results (wide confidence intervals; confidence interval including zero; low number of events); 5.high probability of publication bias. Factors that may increase the quality level of a body of evidence are: 1.large magnitude of eect; 2.all plausible confounding would reduce a demonstrated eect or suggest a spurious eect when results show no eect; 3.dose-response gradient.

We updated the Background to reflect new template text. We specified in primary and secondary outcome measures that we preferred composite neuropathic pain scores over single-scale generic pain scores if both measures were used by studies. We added mean pain intensity as secondary outcome measure. We included the European Union clinical trial register into our search. We added publication bias (all studies funded by the manufacturer of the drug) into the GRADE rating of the quality of evidence, and described our approach to assigning 'very low quality' in some circumstances. We post hoc decided to restrict subgroup analyses to the outcomes as reported in the 'Summary of findings' table. We post hoc decided to perform subgroup analyses of studies with and without publication in peer-reviewed journals and of studies with high and unclear sample size bias. In the 'Summary of findings' table, we substituted the outcome health-related quality of life with nervous system disorders and psychiatric disorders as specific adverse events. We removed the planned analysis by tiers of evidence as this is largely replaced by GRADE. N O T E S Assessed for updating in 2020 A restricted search in June 2020 did not identify any potentially relevant studies likely to change the conclusions. Therefore, this review has now been stabilised following discussion with the authors and editors. The review will be assessed for updating in two years. If appropriate we will update the review before this date if new evidence likely to change the conclusions is published, or if standards change substantially which necessitates major revisions.
