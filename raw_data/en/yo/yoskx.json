Where can I o btain general information about coronavirus and what is being done ? The USA.gov coronavirus website has general information about the SARS- CoV- 2 virus, the virus that causes COVID- 19. The Safer Federal Workforce Task Forc e website offers a comprehensive understanding of the Task Force focus areas, resources, and news. The DOE Website has information about what DOE laboratories and sites are doing to support the COVID response efforts. If you still have a question, you may contact the DOE COVI D-19 Hotline at COVID - 19Inquiries@hq.doe.g ov or by calling 202 -586- 2683. 2. If the DOE COVID -19 Safety Plan and CDC guidance are inconsistent, which guidance should be followed? The CDC guidance should be followed in cases of inconsistency. The DOE COVID -19 Workplace Safety Plan is a living document that is continually reviewed and updated accordingly. Masks 1. Do I need to wear a mask at a DOE site/facility if I have been fully vaccinated? On July 27, 2021, the CDC updated their Interim Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People . In keeping with the new CDC guidelines and guidance from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, all Federal employees, onsite contractors, and visitors, regardless of vaccination status, are to wear a mask inside of Federal buildings located in areas of substantial or high community transmission . As of July 28, 2021, this includes the Washington, DC area. Federal employees, onsite contractors, and visitors who are not fully vaccinated also need to continue to physically distance consistent with CDC guidance. People are considered fully vaccinated: 2 weeks after their second dose in a 2 -dose series, such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines; or 2 weeks after a single -dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson 's Janssen vaccin e 2/25/2021 Updated 7/29/2021 3 Individuals who voluntarily disclose that they are unvaccinated, or decline to provide vaccination information when voluntarily sought, are still required to wear a mask and maintain social distancing in keeping with public health guidance. This change is related to mask wearing and social distancing only. Maximum telework and occupancy limits remain in effect. 2. Do all personnel in a government vehicle need to wear a mask if all persons have been vaccinated? In areas of substantial or high community transmission , including the Washington DC area, all personnel travelling in a government vehicle must wear face masks while in the vehicle. If some occupants are not vaccinated, then all passengers riding in a government vehicle must wear a mask. 3. Do I have to remove my mask in areas where mask use is not required if I am fully vaccinated? You may continue to wear a mask at your discretion. 4. Do I need to wear a mask while on official travel? Yes, that includes planes, buses and trains traveling into, within or outside of the U.S. as part of a federal mask mandate that was extended to September 13, 2021. 5. Do I need to wear two masks? While not required, double masking is one way to improve the efficacy of a mask. Check out more ways to improve your mask's efficacy at the CDC website, Improve How Your Mask Protects You . COVID -19 Response 1. What should I do if I have COVID -19-like symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has or may have COVID -19? Please notify your supervisor and contact your site or the DOE COVID- 19 Hotline at COVID - 19Inquiries@hq.doe.gov or by calling 202 -586- 2683. Personnel should also refer to the latest CDC guidance at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus for additional information. 2/25/2021 Updated 7/29/2021 4 2. If I experience COVID -19 like symptoms after being fully vaccinated, do I need to isolate? The Department follows CDC guidance . If you have symptoms of COVID -19, you should contact your health care provider, get tested , and stay home and away from others. Also notify your supervisor and follow the instructions for your site. 3. What will happen if someone who has been in the building is confirmed to have COVID -19? Personnel with COVID -19 like symptoms or with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID -19 are asked to report their condition to their supervisor and the ir site or DOE COVID -19 Hotline. The site or DOE COVID -19 response team will work with the person and/or their supervisor to identify any work -related close contacts and will help identify which areas need to be cleaned and sanitized. In accordance with CDC guidelines, any individual who has been in close contact with the sick or confirmed individual will be asked to self-quarantine if they have not been vaccinated . If they have been fully vaccinated, they do not need to quarantine ; however , they should still monitor for symptoms of COVID -19 for 14 days following an exposure. Depending on when the sick or confirmed individual was last in the building, the workstation of the individual will be sanitized. Additional cleaning will be done on a case -by-case basis. 4. The CDC recently updated their recommendations for cleaning . Are DOE sites and facilities following the updated guidance? Yes, DOE sites and facilities may follow the updated guidance regarding cleaning and disinfecting a facility. If a person who has been sick or tested positive for COVID- 19 has been in a facility within the last 24 hours, the spaces occupied by that person should be cleaned and disinfected. If more than 24 hours has passed since the person has been in the space, cleaning without performing disinfection is sufficient. If more than 3 days have passed since the person was in the space, no additional cleaning or disinfection is necessary. 5. Do fully vaccinated employees need to quarantine following an exposure or close contact with someone who has COVID -19? Fully vaccinated employees do not need to quarantine or be tested following an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID- 19, as long as the individual exposed has no symptoms. They should still monitor for symptoms of COVID -19 for 14 days following an exposure. If they experience symptoms, they should isolate themselves from others, be clinically evaluated for COVID -19, including SARS- CoV- 2 testing, if indicated, and inform their health care provider of their vaccination status at the time of presentation to care. 6. How are sites screening the workforce as they come to work? 2/25/2021 Updated 7/29/2021 5 If Federal employees, contractors, or visitors are not feeling well, they are not to enter the Federal workplace. DOE sites and facilities have implemented screening processes requiring Federal and contractor employees working on site to complete screenin g for signs and symptoms and other exposure history factors . Visitors will also be asked to complete symptom screening and exposure history before entering a DOE facility. More information can be found in the DOE COVID -19 Workplace Safety Plan . 7. If an individual has recovered from a confirmed COVID -19 case, when can they come back to work in a DOE workspace? Individuals should contact their immediate supervisor to determine when they may retu rn. 8. Will contact tracing continue ? Please refer to \"Contac t Tracing \" in the DOE COVID -19 Workplace Safety Plan . 9. What should I do to protect my family? The Department strongly encourages everyone to follow the guidance provided by the CDC for protecting yourself and your family . 10. Who can I contact if I am suffering from stress, anxiety, or grief ? The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provide s counseling and other resources to help manage stress, anxiety, and grief. Please contact your site's EAP program. All DOE Federal employees may cont act Espr at (877) 801 -5752 to speak to a counselor. Headquarters Federal employees may also contact the Headquarters EAP Specialist at (202) 586- 4995 during business hours. For additional resources, Federal employees may visit the Espr website. DOE's password to the site and additional resources can be found on the internal EAP page . Occupancy Requirements The DOE approach to assessing and meeting building occupancy requirements utilizes the following definition to determine high community prevalence or transmission \"High Community prevalence or transmission is defined as a disease incidence case rate greater than 100 new cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks using a 7 -day rolling average for each day or greater than 200 new cases per 100,000 population in two weeks using a 7 -day rolling average for each day in communities surrounding sites that have demonstrated adequate COVID -19 mitigation controls.\" 1. Where did the incidence rate of 100 new cases per 100,000 population come from? This is one of the CDC definitions of \"high transmission\" for a county. 2/25/2021 Updated 7/29/2021 6 2. Does \"demonstrated adequate COVID -19 mitigation controls\" apply to the site or to the communities surrounding the site? In this context, mitigative controls refers to control measures implemented at the site, not necessarily the community. Sites that have implemented adequate mitigative controls ( mask usage, distancing, cleaning and disinfection, ventilation, etc. ) may be able to more effectively manage a higher community incidence rate. 3. What does \"demonstrated adequate COVID -19 mitigation controls\" mean? Sites must follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) , and the local public health department to mitigate the risk of COVID -19 transmission. Control measures should be based on a thorough hazard assessment. The CDC guidance recommends measures such as social distancing, barriers, masks, and other controls. The OSHA guidance is consistent with the CDC guidance and in line with the principles of the hierarchy of controls. OSHA recommends a combination of measures to limit the spread of COVID -19 in the workplace. The site must be able to show that they have put engineering and administrative controls into place to minimize the transmission of COVID- 19. 4. Can a site still obtain an exception to the occupancy requirement? Yes, a site may still obtain an exception to the occupancy requirement. The site should submit the exception request through their management chain. Travel 1. What travel guidelines sho uld be followed? Federal and contractor employees should adhere strictly to CDC, state, and local guidelines before, during, and after travel, regardless of whether the travel is personal or for official business. More information on this topic may be found in the DOE COVID -19 Workplace Safety Plan. 2. Can I be required to be vaccinated before being approved for official domestic or international tr avel? DOE follows guidance applicable across the Federal government on the policies and requirements for vaccination of the federal workforce. DOE does not require federal employees or contractors to get vaccinated in order to be approved for official dome stic or international travel. The CDC has published guidance for travel for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. DOE is following CDC guidance for domestic and internatio nal travel and expects that individual travelers will follow the travel restrictions appropriate to their situation. For 2/25/2021 Updated 7/29/2021 7 example, per CDC's current guidance, if the traveler is fully vaccinated (2 weeks after the first shot of a one -shot regime or the second shot of a two -shot regime) then post- travel quarantine is not required; if not fully vaccinated, then quarantine or testing, as applicable, may be required. Where you travel matters. If you travel to a high transmission area, you are also at greater risk for getting COVID -19 and transmitting it to others. Check out the CDC's travel recommendations by destination. 3. Do I need to wear a mask while on official travel? Yes, that includes planes, buses and trains traveling into, within or outside of the U.S. as part of a federal mask mandate that was extended to September 13, 2021. 4. Can I receive temporary duty (TDY) a llowance if I self- quarantine at home after official travel? No, except in limited emergency circumstances involving employees who serve in a law enforcement, investigative, or similar capacity. In those cases, the head of the agency may approve appropriate subsistence payments for the employee or members of the employee's family (or both) while occupying temporary living accommodations at or away from the employee's designated post of duty. Such situations will be determined on a case -by-case basis. Vaccines 1. As a DOE federal or contractor employee, am I required by DOE to get vaccinated? DOE follows guidance applicable across the Federal government on the policies and requirements for vaccination of the federal workforce. COVID- 19 vacc ination is not required by DOE at present for DOE Federal employees or contractors. DOE strongly encourages everyone to get an FDA -approved COVID -19 vaccine once it is available to them. Not only does vaccination promote personal and public health, but in addition vaccinated workers may be able to forego wearing masks in federal workplaces, consistent with CDC and state and local guidance. 2. May employees return to work if they have been fully vaccinated? The Department remains on a maximum telework status. Vaccinated Federal and contractor employees may not return to work unless there is a mission critical reason for being on -site. Vaccinated Federal and contractor employees may not always be required to wear a mask or maintain social distance, consistent with CDC and state or local guidance, but they are expected to continue to wash their hands frequently (or use a hand sanitizer) when in a DOE building or on DOE property. Unvaccinated individuals and those who decline to provide vaccination 2/25/2021 Updated 7/29/2021 8 information when voluntarily sought are required to wear a mask and maintain a social distance. 3. If I experience COVID -19 like symptoms after being fully vaccinated, do I need to isolate? The D epartment follows CDC guidance . If you have symptoms of COVID -19, you should contact your health care provider, get tested , and stay home and away from others. Also notify your supervisor and follow the instructions for your site. 4. If I am fully vaccinated, do I need to quarantine following an exposure or close contact with someone who has COVID -19? Fully vaccinated employees do not need to quarantine or be tested following an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID- 19, as long as they have no symptoms. They should still monitor for symptoms of COVID -19 for 14 days following an exposure. If they experience symptoms, they should isolate themselves from others, be clinically evaluated for COVID -19, including SARS- CoV- 2 testing, if indicated, and inform their health care provider of their vaccination status at the time of presentation to care. 5. Should I get a vaccine for COVID -19 if one is offered? Yes, you are strongly encouraged to get an FDA -approved COVID -19 vaccine once it is available. Even if you have had COVID -19 in the past, the CDC still recommends getting the vaccine . 6. Are employees granted administrative leave for the COVID -19 vaccine? Federal employees are allowed up to 4 hours of administrative leave for each dose of the COVID -19 vaccine. This leave is not allowable for illness due to the COVID -19 vaccine; employees are expected to take their sick leave. Federal employees are authorized to take up to two days of administrative leave for any side effects experienced from the COVID -19 vaccine. DOE has also encouraged all contractors to grant a similar 4 hours of administrative leave for employees who work onsite at DOE facilities. 7. If I have an adverse reaction to a vaccine, where should I report it? Most people do not have serious problems after being vaccinated. Your arm may be sore, red, or warm to the touch at the injection site. These symptoms usually go away on their own within a week. Some people report getting a headache or fever when getting a vaccine. These side effects are a sign that your immune system is doing exactly what it is supposed to do . It is working and building up protection to the disease. FDA and CDC are continuing to monitor the safety of the vaccine and ask you to report any side effects. If you do have an adverse reaction, you should contact your health care provider and then report the side effects using the V-safe application which can be downloaded to your phone. You will need a smartphone and information about the COVID -19 vaccine you rece ived. If you do not have a cell phone, you can 2/25/2021 Updated 7/29/2021 9 register any effects in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) . This information will also be provided on the CDC COVID- 19 Vaccine Record Card which you will receive at the time you receive your first dose. Federal employees are authorized to take up to two days of a dministrative leave for side effects from the COVID -19 vaccine. Returning to the Work place 1. I want to return to my physical workplace as soon as I can. When can I expect to do so ? Personnel will be given advance notice and guidance for when they may return to work in accordance with Federal guidance and site -specific procedures, contracts, and local conditions. Personnel are encouraged to consult with their supervisor for information related to their specific workplace s. 2. Is DOE still using a phased approach for returning to the workplace (i.e., Phase 1, 2, 3)? The Department now follows the Department of Energy COVID- 19 Workplace Safety Plan issued on May 18, 2021 , which supersedes DOE's COVID -19 Return to the Federal Workplace Framework . Although sites can still use phase termino logy as needed in describing their postures, the COVID -19 Workplace Safety Plan requires cognizant Departmental Elements and sites to review the mission critical work being performed in -person or on -site, refine their plans, and minimize, where necessary, on -site work. This plan continues to maximize telework to protect the health and safety of the workforce. "}
