Each crystal or stone has specialized gifts for us, drawing in and radiating a healing energy specific to each stone or amplifying spiritual energies. Crystals have been used for many years to heal and bring balance. They work through resonance and vibration. Some crystals contain minerals that are known for their therapeutic properties, e.g. the copper in Malachite reduces swelling and inflammation. Crystal healing works on the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels of being. Crystals re-align subtle energies and dissolve dis-ease. Crystal healing can be used in many forms, for example, wearing a piece of jewelry directly on your body for a specific purpose, using a gem essence, laying crystals around your body (called crystal gridding), crystal massage and reflexology, placing gemstones directly onto your chakras to bring them into balance, using a crystal \"wand\" to draw out pain and negative energy, and using a crystal pendulum to re-align and heal the aura, draw out pain or infuse energy. Our crystal healing course includes how crystals are formed, selecting, cleansing, charging and programming your crystals, crystal meditations, chakras and chakra balancing, auras and aura balancing, healing techniques, crystal gridding, working with pendulums, crystal directory, shamanic crystals, crystal shapes and forms, specific ailments and which crystals to use, animal healing with crystals, and how to perform a full crystal healing on another person.
