large with almost nine million new cases and 1.5 million deaths occurring each year. An estimated three million of these cases went either undiagnosed or unreported in 2013. This is thought to be at least in part due to shortcomings of conventional diagnostic tests. Novel molecular TB diagnostics have been developed and generated great excitement for their potential to improve TB control globally. While results from accuracy studies are promising, it has become apparent that higher accuracy does not necessarily translate into improved patient care. Therefore, policy makers demand more direct evidence that the improved diagnostics positively affect health or other outcomes that matter to patients (such as speed of diagnosis). However, much confusion remains about which patient outcomes should be measured, which designs should be used to assess them and how new tests should be implemented to maximize their impact. The absence of a gold standard test for TB and the associated widespread use of empiric therapy (i.e. treatment without a confirmatory diagnostic test result) further complicate the assessment of both test accuracy and impact on the number of patients placed on therapy. The overall goal of this doctoral thesis therefore was to assess the methodological and practical challenges that arise when trying to estimate the effect of better TB diagnostics on patient outcomes and to suggest ways to improve upon the approaches that have been utilized up until now. This thesis is based on three manuscripts: 1. Impact of molecular tuberculosis diagnostics on patient-important outcomes: a systematic review of study methodology We first developed a conceptual framework to clarify through which mechanisms the improved technical performance of a novel TB test may lead to improved patient outcomes. We then systematically reviewed the literature on studies attempting to assess the impact of molecular TB diagnostics on such outcomes. We found 25 eligible studies that assessed a wide range of outcomes and utilized a variety of experimental and observational study designs. Interestingly, we found that many potentially strong design options had never been used, highlighting opportunities for future research. We elaborate on the methodological challenges with various study designs and outcome 4 measures, discuss shortcomings in analysis and reporting and provide recommendations to minimize risk of bias in future studies. 2. Impact of point-of-care implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF: product versus process innovation The second manuscript aimed to study the relative contributions of product innovation (a novel test with higher speed and accuracy) and process innovation (a point-of-care [POC] testing program) in improving patient outcomes. In a study of 1,012 patients in a tertiary care hospital in India, we measured process innovation impact by comparing time to diagnosis between 'routine' versus POC testing. We measured product innovation impact by comparing accuracy and time to diagnosis between the novel molecular test (Xpert) and the standard test (smear microscopy). Xpert had high accuracy but the incremental value of one Xpert test over two smear tests was limited. Implementing Xpert as a routine laboratory test did not reduce time to diagnosis compared to smear-based diagnosis. In contrast, the POC program did reduce time to diagnosis but required dedicated staff and substantial adaptation of clinic workflow. In conclusion, we found that process innovation by way of a POC program had a bigger impact on time to diagnosis than the product per se. Thus, depending on the setting, process innovation may yield greater benefits than innovative technologies or achieve complementary improvements in patient care. 3. Accuracy of childhood tuberculosis diagnostics: estimation in the absence of a gold standard via latent class analysis In the third manuscript, we assessed the accuracy of new diagnostics for TB diagnosis in children, a population that poses many challenges for test validation. We re-analyzed data from a study on 910 children with suspected pulmonary TB in South Africa in whom standard TB tests and a novel molecular test had been performed. The original analysis had compared the accuracy of the novel molecular test to culture. However, the sensitivity of culture is known to be imperfect for childhood TB, leading to biased accuracy estimates for the molecular test. We fitted a Bayesian latent class model to the results from six tests that had been performed on each child, carefully integrating prior knowledge about disease processes and test mechanisms. We also considered the influence of important covariates on the pre-test probability and on test accuracy parameters. This allowed us to estimate the accuracy of each test as well as the TB prevalence in the cohort. We found that culture had a sensitivity of only about 60% and that doctors over-treated one case for each treated true TB 5 case. We concluded that latent class analysis is a valuable modeling framework for childhood TB and that its use for other forms of TB where no gold standard is available (e.g. extrapulmonary TB and HIV-associated TB) should be explored. In conclusion, in this thesis I highlight key methodological and practical challenges that arise when trying to estimate the effect of better TB diagnostics on patient outcomes, in particular the importance of context and implementation strategy, important considerations when choosing outcomes and study design and the related pitfalls during analysis. I also suggest ways to improve upon the approaches that have been utilized up until now. 6 R\u00e9sum\u00e9 La charge mondiale de morbidit\u00e9 de la tuberculose (TB) demeure importante, avec pr\u00e8s de 9 millions et 1,5 million de d\u00e9c\u00e8s chaque ann\u00e9e.

Maarten van Smeden provided support with initial programming. 12 Statement of Originality The three manuscripts that form the core of this thesis all include original scholarship and provide contributions to knowledge. My systematic review (chapter 3, manuscript 1), is the first review to summarize results of studies assessing the impact of TB diagnostic tests on outcomes beyond accuracy. The conceptual frameworks that are part of this review are also original contributions. I also developed the tool for assessment of risk of bias as part of the review. My primary research study (chapter 4, manuscript 2) of Xpert is the first to provide a direct comparison of two implementation strategies\u2014routine versus point-of-care and highlights both the importance of implementation strategy and context. The Bayesian latent class analysis (chapter 5, manuscript 3) is based on a model using a large number of tests, key covariates and careful modeling of the conditional dependence structure as a result of close collaboration between multiple experts. No such analysis has been done before for childhood TB and the accuracy estimates are thus a unique contribution. The Bayesian Lasso is a relatively new development with few applied examples in the literature and even fewer in the context of latent class analysis. Its use allowed me to specify a rich model to capture key aspects of disease biology and test mechanisms, while avoiding overfitting and estimate inflation, providing another important contribution to the literature. 13 List of Abbreviations CI Confidence Interval CrI Credible Interval CXR Chest X-Ray or Chest Radiography BCG Bacillus Calmette-Guerin CIHR Canadian Institutes of Health Research HIV Human immunodeficiency virus\u0001 Lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator LTBI Latent tuberculosis infection MDR-TB Tuberculin Units\u0001 WHO World Health Organization XDR Extensively drug-resistant 14 List of Figures Figure 1 Stages of M. tuberculosis infection. ................................................................................................... 18 Figure 2.

While the situation has improved massively in many rich parts of the world, TB continues to take a massive toll globally and poses new threats even to rich countries due to the development of drug-resistant forms of TB that are virtually untreatable. In 2013, 9 million new cases were estimated to occur and 1.5 million deaths, making TB the second deadliest infectious disease after HIV and the most common cause of death among HIV-infected individuals2. Notably, of the estimated 9 million cases, 3 million were never diagnosed or reported, pointing to major problems with current approaches with case finding and diagnosis. TB also poses a major barrier to social and economic development with the World Bank estimating that loss of productivity attributable to TB is 4 to 7 percent of some countries' gross domestic product3. Early diagnosis and treatment is the main strategy to control TB, since the only existing vaccine for TB is ineffective in adults and only moderately effective in children, and since no other major preventive interventions exist that are applicable to the general population of high-burden countries4,5. Unfortunately, TB diagnosis today largely relies on the same techniques developed over a century ago, namely microscopy, mycobacterial culture and chest radiography6. Thanks to new sources of funding, innovative financing mechanisms and the establishment of product development partnerships7, the traditional lack incentive to develop tests for a disease that mostly affects poor people in poor countries has recently been replaced by a growing interest in developing new technologies8. The growing number of new TB tests requires evaluation of their diagnostic accuracy. However, there is also a growing recognition that high accuracy alone is often insufficient to improve patient health9,10. In addition to 'test research', 'diagnostic research' on the complete process of diagnosis is needed with a focus on patient outcomes rather than test accuracy11. This requires different designs and different threats to study validity become relevant. In contrast to 'test research', no specific guidance exists on how to design, conduct and report research from such studies or how to integrate their findings in a systematic review. Additionally, 'diagnostic research' makes it apparent that it is not only the test that matters but also the system around the test, e.g. its implementation within a point-of-care testing program to ensures continuity of care12. 16 While assessing the value of new tests by estimating its impact on patient health directly is important, evaluating test accuracy remains a crucial first step, which is often hindered by the lack of a gold standard test13. This situation is particularly severe in children, where even culture\u2014the test used as a reference standard in adults\u2014has low and unknown sensitivity. This lack of a good comparator makes development of new, more sensitive tests for childhood TB harder and evaluation with traditional methodology that relies on a gold standard impractical. Importantly, estimation of the impact of new tests on patient health is also hindered in the absence of a gold standard. One of the most common outcome measures in diagnostic research is the difference in the 'number of patients started on anti-tuberculosis therapy'. However, this is a just a proxy measure for the 'number of true TB patients started on anti-tuberculosis therapy' because in the absence of good tests both over- and under-treatment occur. The measurement error implicit in using this proxy may lead to biased estimates of the impact of novel tests. 1.2 Thesis goal, aims and specific objectives The goal of my thesis is to address some of the methodological challenges that arise in the estimation of the impact of tuberculosis diagnostics on patient outcomes. The aims and specific objectives of my thesis are as follows: 1. To systematically review study methodology used to measure the impact of TB diagnostics on patient outcomes (manuscript 1) with the following specific objectives: 1.1. to develop a conceptual framework for the relevant patient-important outcomes and to assess which of these outcomes have been measured in available studies; 1.2. to outline which designs and methodologies could theoretically be employed to measure the impact of diagnostics on patient-important outcomes and to assess which of them have been utilized in available studies; 1.3. to propose criteria for the assessment of risk of bias for each utilized design based on sound epidemiological principles where such tools don't already exist and to assess the risk of bias and quality of reporting in available studies. 2. To assess the relative contribution of a novel rapid test versus a point-of-care testing program in shortening time to TB diagnosis in a cohort of TB suspects at an Indian tertiary care hospital (manuscript 2) with the following specific objectives: 17 2.1. to assess the impact of product innovation by evaluating the technical performance of Xpert performed outside of a routine laboratory, by a minimally trained health worker compared to smear microscopy and liquid culture; 2.2. to assess the impact of process innovation by evaluating the effect of implementing Xpert within a POC program compared to its use as a routine laboratory test on reductions in diagnostic delay. 3. To address the lack of a gold standard test for childhood TB using a Bayesian latent class model in a cohort of childhood TB suspects at a South African hospital (manuscript 3) with the following specific objectives: 3.1. to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of tests for childhood TB; 3.2. to estimate the impact of covariates on test accuracy; 3.3. to estimate the prevalence and levels of over- and under-treatment of childhood TB. 18 Chapter 2: Literature review 2.1 Tuberculosis 2.1.1 TB pathogenesis & transmission Tuberculosis disease is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Transmission occurs via inhalation of airborne droplet nuclei that are typically produced by a coughing diseased individual. MTB primarily infects the lung causing pulmonary TB but may infect any other part of the body and is then referred to as extrapulmonary TB. The immune response to and natural history of TB is complex and much of it is still not understood, contributing to the limited success in developing an effective or simple diagnostics such as those available for HIV or Malaria. The basic stages of MTB infection are depicted in Figure X. Upon inhalation of MTB, most people develop so-called latent TB infection (LTBI), where the immune system successfully prevents spread of the disease. Patients with LTBI do not have any symptoms and are not infectious. A small percentage of patients with LTBI will progress to active TB disease, commonly simply referred to as TB. TB patients typically have productive cough, fever, night sweats and may suffer from weight loss and may produce infectious aerosols, completing the transmission cycle. Standard treatment for TB is based on a cocktail of four different antibiotics taken for a duration of six months. If appropriately administered, cure rates can be close to 100%, while mortality can be 50% and higher in the absence of treatment. Figure 1 Stages of M. tuberculosis infection.14 REVIEWdoi:10.1038/nature09657The challenge of new drug is more prevalent in the world today than at any other time in human history.Mycobacteriumtuberculosis,the pathogen responsible for TB, uses diverse strategies to survive in a variety of host lesions and toevade immune surveillance. A key question is how robust are our approaches to discovering new TB drugs, and whatmeasures could be taken to reduce the long and protracted clinical development of new drugs. The emergence ofmulti-drug-resistant strains ofM. tuberculosismakes the discovery of new molecular scaffolds a priority, and thecurrent situation even necessitates the re-engineering and repositioning of some old drug families to achieveeffective control. Whatever the strategy used, success will depend largely on our proper understanding of thecomplex interactions between the pathogen and its human host. In this review, we discuss innovations in TB drugdiscovery and evolving strategies to bring newer agents more quickly to patients.In 1882, Robert Koch identifiedMycobacterium tuberculosisas thecausative agent his discovery the global TB epidemicseems unabated; this year it is anticipated that there will be about 9.8million new cases, more than in any other year in history1. This situationhighlights the relative shortcomings of the current treatment strategiesfor TB and the limited effectiveness of public health systems, particularlyin resource-poor countries where the main TB burden lies. The ease withwhich TB infection spreads (for example, by inhalation of a few dropletnuclei 2-5mm in diameter containing as few as 1-3 bacilli2), has helpedto sustain this scourge at current levels. In spite of half a century of anti-TB chemotherapy, one-third of the world's population asymptomati-cally still harbour a dormant or latent form ofM. tuberculosiswith alifelong risk of disease reactivation (Fig. 1). Reactivation of latent TB,even after decades of subclinical persistence, is a high risk factor fordisease development particularly in immunocompromised individualssuch as those co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),on an anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy or with diabetes3(Box 1). Inrecent years, the TB epidemic has been further fuelled by the emergence 1Department of Antimicrobial Research, Janssen Research and Development, Johnson & Johnson, Turnhoutseweg 30, B-2340 Beerse, Belgium.2Department of Antimicrobial Research, Janssen non-infectious (latent) disease.A sizeable pool of latently infected people may relapse into active TB, years aftertheir first exposure to the bacterium. Latent TB is commonly activated byimmune suppression, as in the case of HIV. In cases of drug-susceptible (DS)-TB(denoted by an asterisk), 95% of patients recover upon treatment, whereas 5%relapse. If untreated (denoted by two asterisks), rifamycin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for the first 2months followed by a continuation phase of isoniazid and a rifamycinfor the last 4 months. Up to 95% of people with DS-TB can be cured in6m o n t h sw i t ht h i sf o u r - d r u gr e g i m e n .MDR-TB is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the two mostimportant first-line drugs used in the treatment of TB. This may resultfrom either primary infection with drug-resistant bacteria or maydevelop in the course of a patient's treatment when non-optimaltreatment durations or regimens are used. Cure rates for MDR-TB arelower, typically ranging from 50% to 70%.XDR-TB is resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin as well as and second-line anti-TB injectable drugs(amikacin, TB is asymptomatic and not infectious; it of the growth ofM. tuberculosisin hosts.Approximately 5% (higher risk if immunosuppressed; for example,with HIV) of these patients will go on to develop active disease at somestage in life. The term dormancy is used to describe latent TB diseaseas well as a metabolic state of non-replicative TB bacterium. Of severalenvironmental stresses encountered by the TB bacterium in host cells,hypoxia has been shown to induce non-replicative bacterialphenotypes, leading to tolerance towards certain drugs like cell-wallinhibitors such as isoniazid; and lack of potent drug activity on thesebacterial phenotypes may be responsible for prolonging the TBtreatment duration74.27 JANUARY 2011 | VOL 469 | NATURE | 483Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved\u00a9201119 The natural history and probability of treatment success can vary widely depending on host factors and the type of MTB. In particular, individuals that are immune-suppressed, e.g. due to HIV infection, malnutrition or diabetes, progress to active TB at a much higher rate than immunocompetent individuals. MTB that is resistant to important first-line TB drugs may be much harder or almost impossible to cure. In particular, multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), defined as TB resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, is a major concern\u2014treatment may last almost two years, success rates are much lower (<50%), and drugs are much more expensive and toxic. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is defined as MDR-TB plus resistance to at least one fluoroquinolone and a second-line injectable drug; other forms of TB have acquired resistance to even more drugs and have been called untreatable. Drug-susceptibility testing is essential to ensure that TB is treated with drugs that will be effective. 2.1.2 Global epidemiology of tuberculosis and control strategies It has been estimated that a third of the world's population has LTBI, i.e. harbors the bacterium but is asymptomatic and not infectious15. The incidence of active TB varies enormously by region (Figure 2) and the total number of new cases was estimated to be 9 million in 20132. Figure 2.

Although treatment success rates are high (86%) there were an estimated 1.5 million deaths, about a quarter of which occurred in HIV-infected individuals. While prevalence and mortality have declined significantly over the past 20 years, incidence has started to fall only more recently and at a much slower rate of 1-2% per year (Figure 3). Figure 3. Global trends in estimated rates of TB incidence, prevalence and mortality.2 The horizontal dashed lines represent the Stop TB Partnership targets of a 50% reduction in prevalence and mortality rates by 2015 compared with 1990. Shaded areas represent uncertainty bands. Mortality excludes TB deaths among HIV-positive people. There were an estimated 480,000 cases of MDR-TB in 2013, 9% of which may have been XDR-TB. In 2009 only one in six cases of MDR-TB were diagnosed using drug-susceptibility testing. While the situation has much improved thanks to new rapid diagnostic tests, still less than half of the estimated number of cases were appropriately diagnosed2 in 2013. Childhood tuberculosis (TB) is an important global health problem that has received insufficient attention17. A major challenge in childhood pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is the lack of a gold standard diagnostic test18-21 leading to large uncertainties about the true global burden of childhood TB, with recent point estimates ranging from around 0.5 to 1 million new cases per year2,22. In high-burden countries 20-40% of TB cases are believed to occur in children23,24 and >75% of childhood TB is pulmonary TB18. Since the mid-nineties, TB control globally has been based on the DOTS (directly observed treatment, short-course) strategy as promoted by the WHO. The scope of this strategy was widened in the 'Stop TB Strategy' in 2006 to address HIV-associated and drug-resistant TB.

Targets of the strategy include a 90% reduction in tuberculosis incidence and a 95% reduction in tuberculosis deaths over the next 20 years25. 2.1.3 TB in India & South Africa India and South Africa are among the countries most affected by TB. With 1.4 million notified cases in 2013 India has the largest burden of TB in terms of absolute numbers and the incidence rates are among the highest in South Africa (Figure 4), reaching almost 1 per 100 population. Figure 4. Estimated TB incidence: top-ten countries, 20132 There are important differences in the TB epidemiology between India and South Africa. The HIV prevalence among TB patients with known status is 62% in South Africa, representing the main driver of TB epidemic. In contrast, HIV is relatively rare in India but malnutrition is widespread and a key contributor. Other important differences pertain to the laboratory systems. India relies heavily on its network of smear microscopy centers with one smear lab per 100,000 population (versus 0.4 smear lab per 100,000 in South Africa). Capacity to perform the more sensitive mycobacterial culture and drug-susceptibility testing is much lower in India than in South Africa (0.2 culture/DST per 5 million versus 1.4 culture/DST per 5 million). Related to this difference in testing, another important difference between the countries approach to TB diagnosis is operational: South Africa relies on a centralized network of large laboratories with samples and results being transported by GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS REPORT 2014 | 17FIGURE 2.3 Estimated TB incidence: top-ten countries, 2013 AfricaLesothoSwaziland 60090012001500EthiopiaDR CongoPhilippinesBangladeshSouth AfricaIndonesiaPakistanNigeriaChinaIndia 0.51.01.52.0MillionsIncidence: absolute numbers regions (Figure 2.7), fastest in the European Region (4.5% per year) and slowest in the Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia Regions (less than 1% per year and 1.5% per year, respectively). Incidence rates have been falling since around 2000 in the South-East Asia Region; they peaked around 1999 in the European Region and around 2003 in the African region, and have been falling since 1990 in Eastern Mediterranean Region, the Region of the Americas and the Western Pacific Region. The latest assessment for the 22 HBCs suggests that incidence rates are falling in most countries (Figure 2.8). 2.2 TB prevalence In countries with a relatively high burden of TB (around 100 cases per 100 000 population or more), the preva-lence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB can be directly measured in nationwide population-based surveys using sample sizes of around 50 000 people. Sur-vey results can be used to produce a national estimate of TB prevalence that includes all forms of TB. The cost of a survey usually ranges from US$ 1 to 4 million, and com-prehensive theoretical and practical guidance on survey design, implementation, analysis and reporting of results FIGURE 2.4 Estimated HIV prevalence in new and relapse TB cases, 2013 HIV prevalence in new TB cases,all ages (%)0-45-1920-4950No dataNot applicable22 courier, while in India testing is usually done on-site. This has important implications for diagnostic delays and needs to be considered when forming expectations about the potential of new diagnostics in reducing them. 2.2 Diagnosis of tuberculosis 2.2.1 Diagnostic tests for tuberculosis Diagnostic tools introduced more than 100 years ago are still the mainstay of TB diagnosis today and diagnostic delays of two to three months are the norm mainly because of inaccurate tests and patient and provider delays26,27. Thus, the lack of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests is a major hurdle in controlling TB. By far the most commonly used diagnostic test is smear microscopy, which consists of microscopic examination of a stained sputum sample. Smear microscopy has known limitations in respect to its sensitivity and inability to differentiate drug-sensitive from resistant TB7. Because of its low sensitivity, patients testing negative by smear-microscopy are often treated empirically (i.e. without microbiological confirmation) as 'smear-negative TB'. Sputum culture is the recommended reference standard for adult TB but takes weeks to months to provide results and requires well-equipped laboratories and highly trained personnel7,28. Several studies have shown that the addition of culture to smear microscopy may not increase the number of patients treated because of the delay in time to results and the number of patients lost to follow-up29-31. The surprising lack of benefit from adding culture to smear microscopy highlights the fact that accuracy studies are sometimes insufficient and should only be the first step when evaluating the impact of new diagnostics9. Thus, implementation research of new techniques is necessary to inform the optimal use and placement of a new technology within existing diagnostic algorithms and at the different levels of health care10,32. Molecular tests for TB that detect genetic material of MTB are also available but only recently have versions been developed that are appropriate for the resource-poor settings where TB is common (details are discussed in section 2.2.3). Serological tests for TB, i.e. tests that exploit the humoral immune response to TB by detecting antibodies formed against MTB, currently don't play a role in TB diagnosis and are actively discouraged by the WHO33. As explained in section 2.1.1, most infections with MTB do not progress to active disease, because the immune system can eliminate the infection or contain the bacteria such that they remain 23 in a dormant state that does not cause any symptoms. The tuberculin skin test (TST) and Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) can detect infection with TB by measuring the human cellular immune response to exposure with the bacillus but cannot differentiate between past exposure, past disease or active disease34. In adult TB they are used for the diagnosis of LTBI in asymptomatic individuals at high risk of developing active TB. In the diagnosis of childhood TB TST and IGRAs serve as a marker of exposure to TB. In contrast to adults, exposed children have a very high risk of developing active disease and therefore these tests form part of the evaluation for active TB in children, as described further in the following section. 2.2.2 TB diagnosis in children While microbiological confirmation by smear microscopy or culture is usually possible in adult pulmonary TB, this is not the case for children. All microbiological tests for pulmonary TB in children rely on obtaining a respiratory sample. Young children often have difficulty to expectorate a sputum sample but alternative ways of obtaining a sample (e.g. sputum induction) can be used35,36. However, the sensitivity of all microbiological tests is significantly lower in children than in adults because respiratory samples from children generally contain fewer bacteria. Because of the low sensitivity of microbiological tests, diagnosis of pulmonary TB in children often relies on a combination of exposure history, signs, symptoms, radiological findings and the tuberculin skin test18,36. Various approaches to combine these findings for the diagnosis of childhood TB have been proposed using either scoring systems, diagnostic classifications or diagnostic algorithms37,38. Figure 5 Schematic of the disease spectrum in children.20 Of all children with true active TB only a subset can be microbiologically confirmed. Clinical symptoms consistent with TB are present in many children with active TB but are may also be due to other diseases and are thus unspecific. Infection can be detected with the tuberculin skin test in some children but not all will have active disease. frequencies of children with at least 1 sign and symptom sug-gestive of tuberculosis disease and chest radiographs consistentwith intrathoracic tuberculosis disease who have (1) a posi-tive clinical response to antituberculosis treatment or (2)documented exposure to tuberculosis or (3) immunologicalevidence of tuberculosis infection.Given the poor performance of culture in children, a com-posite laboratory-based reference standard could be denedfor the classication of a larger number of children asmicrobiologically-conrmed cases once sufcient evidencebecomes available on the performance of new diagnostic tests,such as automated nucleic acid amplication tests in children[22]. However, the group agreed that there is not enoughinformation at this stage to develop this composite laboratoryreference standard and further studies are needed. Statisticalmethods for the evaluation of diagnostics, such as latent classanalysis and others, that aim to estimate sensitivity and speci-city in the absence of a suitable reference standard were dis-cussed by the group. These methods have many limitations,including that fact that estimated sensitivity and specicity maydepend heavily on the model assumptions, which cannot bevalidated [23]. More research applying these methods in pedi-atric tuberculosis diagnostics is necessary to elucidate whetherthese limitations apply in this setting.Finally, we achieved consensus that late-stage evaluationstudies should be conducted in curative settings where chil-dren with tuberculosis can be routinely diagnosed. Thesesettings should also have access to laboratories with quality-assured culture facilities. Both the reference standard andindex tests should be administered simultaneously, which isparticularly important in children at high risk of rapid diseaseprogression.STANDARDIZED APPROACH TOPROCEDURES, DEFINITIONS, AND DATACOLLECTIONAs previously indicated, childhood tuberculosis diagnosticstudies are characterized by heterogeneous methodologies (see[3]). Participants at the workshop reinforced previous calls forstandardized approaches for all aspects of diagnostic studies[3,24,25], including laboratory and clinical assessment pro-cedures and data reporting. Standard operating proceduresshould govern all aspects of laboratory methodologies, in-cluding sample collection, processing, transport and storage,and laboratory procedures for specic diagnostic tests andshould include procedures for quality assurance. The studyprotocol should include detailed guidance on standard oper-ating procedures for uniform collection of all data required inthe clinical case denition (eg, chest radiography, documentedexposure, response to treatment) and for obtaining microbi-ological conrmation (type of samples to be collected, numberof cultures, and choice and sequence of laboratory tests).Patients should be classied objectively into the proposed di-agnostic categories via independent systematic review, usingall data collected as specied per protocol. To ensure consistentand reproducible application of the criteria, this categorizationshould be retrospectively reviewed by an independent re-viewer(s) unaware of the initialclassication. In all phasesof evaluation, tests should receive blinded interpretationwith regard to each other. Standard guidelines should befollowed for data reporting including those outlined in theStandards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies [26].Reporting should include inconclusive results of all candidatetests performed and, as much as possible, stratication by age,HIV status, and clinical severity.NEXT STEPS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSDeveloping standardized approaches for the evaluation oftuberculosis diagnostics among pediatric populations representsa critical rst step for establishing the evidence base requiredto improve the detection and conrmation of tuberculosis inchildren, and for ensuring that the benets of technologicaladvances in tuberculosis diagnosis are realized for children asTable 2.

Also note thatchildren with clinical symptoms consistent with tuberculosis can fall intoany of the other circles, including those unexposed to tuberculosis. Intrathoracic Tuberculosis Research in ChildrendJID 2012:205 (Suppl 2)dS213 at McGill University Libraries on November 16, 2013http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from 24 However, there are multiple limitations to the approaches published thus far37,38: systems have been developed in the absence of an accurate reference standard; the weighting of imperfect measures used in these algorithms is usually based on subjective clinical opinion rather than more objective statistical methodology that accounts for the magnitude of the accuracy of the measure; few published systems have been validated outside the study population and often do not take important covariates such as HIV-infection and malnutrition into account37,38. As a result there is wide variability between the published systems in terms of predicted case yield and none of these systems is satisfactory as a way to approach diagnosis of childhood TB38. In the case of childhood TB in particular, the lack of a gold-standard test thus poses a number of problems: (i) diagnosis of individuals is difficult, leading to both over-diagnosis and under-diagnosis19, (ii) evaluation of new tests or diagnostic algorithms is affected by misclassification bias13,39 and (iii) the prevalence of childhood TB cannot be determined and therefore the true burden of disease remains unknown18. As a step towards addressing these problems the National Institute of Health recently convened an expert panel to develop a consensus definition of childhood TB21. However, this case definition does not address the above problems as it simply places children into five categories (ranging from confirmed TB to definite exclusion of TB). This does not allow estimation of probability of disease in a given child, estimation of accuracy or TB prevalence. 2.2.3 Recent advances & pipeline of tests Alternatives to smear and culture in resource-limited setting have not been available until recently. In 2010 the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), a novel DNA-based test, greatly invigorating interest in using molecular diagnostics for TB and drug-resistance40. The Xpert test provides results on TB detection and rifampin resistance testing in sputum samples within less than two hours. Other key advantages of this test are its increased sensitivity compared to sputum smear alone (sensitivity >98% on smear positive, ~70% on smear negative samples), its improved time to diagnosis and the simplicity of the testing-procedure41-43. Studies have shown that the addition of a bactericidal sample reagent buffer for the Xpert and the closed configuration of the cartridge effectively reduce the risk of infectious-aerosol formation to below that of smear preparation44,45. This makes the Xpert assay suitable for use in settings where bio-containment facilities are not available. As the test is automated and provides rapid results, it can potentially be used in a routine clinic setting at the point-of-care (POC), such that patients could be 25 put on appropriate treatment on the day they provide the sample46-48. However, POC-use of Xpert or other molecular TB diagnostics has not properly evaluated. Since the release of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and its endorsement by the WHO, interest in developing new technologies for TB diagnosis has grown immensely. Many are NAAT assays like the Xpert but other approaches are also explored8. Target Product Profiles (TPPs) have been developed to ensure that high-priority needs are addressed49,50. With the many new tests that are bound to emerge from the development pipeline the needs for rigorous assessment of performance will only increase over the coming years. Both research of test accuracy and of impact of downstream patient outcomes will be needed to ensure optimal use of health care resources and appropriate placement and implementation of the right tests for the right setting. Figure 6 Pipeline of molecular diagnostics for tuberculosis, by level of deployment (i.e., reference, intermediate, and peripheral microscopy laboratories).8 high tuberculosis burden (HBCs) showed that, while a majority(86%) of these countries have a policy or algorithm for use ofXpert technology, current implementation is mostly donorfunded, largely dependent on testing in centralized laboratories,and primarily involves patients with presumed drug-resistanceor HIV infection [13]. The survey used the ratio of smear vol-umes for initial diagnosis to the number of Xpert cartridgesprocured during a roughly similar period as an approximateindex of Xpert market penetration in the public sector. Theratio in South Africa was 1.6, signicantly lower than mostother HBCs, where approximately 40-70 smears were for each cartridge [13]. This suggests that wide-scale implementation of Xpert technology has mostly occurredin South Africa, while other HBCs continue to rely heavily onsmear microscopy.A recent published study of various stakeholders helped esta-blish the most important unmet needs and identify tools thatare of highest importance. Kik et al conducted a priority-settingexercise to identify the highest priority tests for target productprole (TPP) development and investment in research and de-velopment [14]. For each of the potential TPPs, 10 criteria wereused to set priorities, including prioritization by key stakehold-ers (eg, managers of national tuberculosis programs), potentialimpact of the test on tuberculosis transmission, morbidity andmortality, market potential, and implementation and scalabilityof the test. On the basis of this analysis, the following wereidentied as the highest priorities: (1) a point-of-care sputum-based test as a replacement for smear-replacement test); (2) a point-of-care, non-sputum-based testcapable of detecting all forms of tuberculosis via the identica-tion of characteristic biomarkers or biosignatures (ie, a non-sputum based biomarker test); (3)ap o i n t - o f - c a r et r i a g et e s t ,which should be a simple, low-cost test for use byrst-contacthealthcare providers as a test for ruling out tuberculosis (ie, atriage test); and (4) rapid DST at microscopy centers (ie, arapid DST).

For the case of infectious disease diagnostics, one may categorize phases of evaluation as targeting (i) technical performance e.g. evaluating accuracy and reliability, (ii) diagnostic impact e.g. evaluating influence on clinical decision-making about diagnosis, (iii) therapeutic impact e.g. evaluating changes in treatment decisions and (iv) patient outcome impact e.g. evaluating influence on patient mortality. One may also consider the downstream public health impact e.g. evaluating impact on reducing disease incidence. The different outcomes measured in these phases require different design approaches and some outcomes provide more direct evidence for a tests impact on health outcomes than others. In particular, in what has also been referred to as 'test research'11 (i) the focus is on measurement and study validity mostly depends on issues related to measurement biases. In 'diagnostic research' (ii-iv), where a broader perspective is taken, issues of confounding and selection bias become the key areas of concern in regards to study validity. The existing TB diagnostics literature is mostly limited to studies on diagnostic accuracy and there are very few studies that assess the clinical, patient or public health impact of tests52,53. However, diagnostic accuracy is only a surrogate outcome for actual improvement of patient outcomes9,54,55 for a variety of reasons, for example clinicians may initiate empiric therapy for a disease in the absence of test results or even despite a negative finding by an accurate test clinicians may wait for confirmatory results by more traditional tests even after a new accurate test indicated presence or absence of disease the patient may be lost to follow-up by the time the new test yields a result adherence to therapy and treatment outcomes may differ in the additional cases detected by a new, more sensitive test Because of this, evidence from accuracy studies is often rated as \"low quality\" by the GRADE model of guideline development, even if the study itself is free from major biases. There is therefore a need for diagnostic studies that go beyond accuracy and measure the impact of tests on clinical decision-making and patient-relevant outcomes more directly to inform guideline development9. 27 2.3.2 Diagnostic Research: outcomes beyond accuracy While diagnostic accuracy studies are commonly either case-control or cross-sectional studies, different designs are usually required if a test's impact on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes is to be measured. Diagnostic RCTs are often considered to provide the highest quality evidence to measure the impact of a test on patient outcomes. However, they are rarely done because they are expensive, usually require large sample sizes compared to therapeutic clinical trials54,56 and ethical issues may preclude randomization57. An alternative design to study a test's impact on clinical decision-making is a diagnostic before/after study where the clinicians proposed patient management plan is recorded before and after test results become available58,59. This design may be implemented either retrospectively via review of medical records or prospectively using designated data collection instruments. Retrospective before/after studies can be challenging to perform as missing data in medical records are common and because inferring decision-making from routine records is not always possible, unless doctors record why they changed their decisions. Prospective before/after studies are usually considered the better choice but may induce a 'Hawthorne effect' (observer effect). A different type of before/after study - henceforth referred to as pre/post implementation study for clarity - assesses patient management and/or patient outcomes by comparing two historically distinct periods: the period before a new test was introduced (pre-implementation) to the period after the new test was introduced (post-implementation). This pragmatic design is usually feasible as it can be done any time a new test is implemented. However, in contrast to the before/after study described above (which aims to estimate individual causal effects) a pre/post implementation study estimates an average causal effect and may therefore be subject to selection bias and confounding by temporal trends. For example, if new treatments become available during the post implementation phase of the study, it may be impossible to disentangle the effect of that new treatment from the effect of the new test. 2.3.3 Approaches for estimating accuracy without gold standard To assess the value of a new test, diagnostic test accuracy studies need to be performed. Ideally, the new test (referred to as the 'index test') is compared to a gold standard test (a test with perfect accuracy) to determine its sensitivity and specificity. Often, such a gold standard does not exist and various approaches have been suggested to deal with this complication13. 28 A common approach is to accept a 'reference standard' as the comparator in place of a gold standard test. This means that the index test will simply be compared to the reference standard test and accuracy parameters (e.g. sensitivity and specificity) calculated as usual and is thus simple and easily understood. This may be acceptable and lead to minimal bias if the reference standard has accuracy that is close to perfect. Of course, with increasing departure from 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, bias in estimating accuracy of the index test will start to increase. In some situations, a 'composite reference standard' (CRS) can be constructed by combining results from several tests based on a specific rule60,61. Commonly this involves defining disease as \"present\" if any of the test used in the CRS are positive, maximizing sensitivity of the CRS. Like the use of a reference standard, this has the advantage of being conceptually simple and easily understood. This can be an acceptable strategy if all tests involved have high specificity but if that is not the case can lead to bias in estimating accuracy of the index test. Another approach is the so-called 'panel diagnosis'62, where a group of experienced clinicians with access to all test results (apart from those of the index test) will provide their judgment about the likely diagnosis on a case by case basis and reach consensus. This can be a good strategy for some diseases but is very hard to implement and should use appropriate methods to reach consensus, such as Delphi methods13. Difficulties also arise because disagreements between (and even within raters if the same case is presented again) is often large. Latent class analysis63,64 is yet another approach that can be employed and details of various aspects of this methodology and some if its variants are discussed in the following section. 2.3.4 Latent class analysis Latent class analysis is a statistical modelling technique that allows the estimation of test accuracy and disease prevalence in the absence of gold-standard13,65,66. Latent class models treat the true disease status as 'latent', i.e. unobserved and use the combined information of several imperfect tests to allow inference about each tests' accuracy and the disease prevalence. These models have been used widely in the psychometrics and social sciences literature since the 1950s, but have only recently been applied for medical research problems where there is no gold-standard test64. These models have been successfully applied for estimating TB prevalence67 and for evaluating TB tests67-70. 29 Types of latent class models. Diverse latent class models have been described, allowing for the observed imperfect variables (i.e. imperfect diagnostic tests in our application) to be either categorical or continuous71. These models can be expanded to allow for the inclusion of covariates that impact either test accuracy or disease prevalence72. They can also allow for adjustment of the covariance (often referred to as conditional dependence) that may arise between the multiple imperfect measures within each latent class. Different covariance structures have been described. A random effects model may be suitable when adjusting for covariance that may arise due to an unmeasured patient characteristic, e.g. disease severity73. A multiple latent variable model may be suitable when the dependence arises between sub-groups of tests based on the same biological mechanism74, e.g. dependence may arise between two tests measuring immune response to TB. Checking model assumptions. As with any statistical model, the validity of latent class models are jeopardized when their assumptions are not met. In order to ensure that the assumptions of the model are transparent and to make the model easy to interpret, a diagram can be used to show how various tests and patient characteristics are related to the underlying latent disease status75. This approach will help in identifying variables that induce conditional dependence (by affecting test accuracy alone) and allow for the assessment of content validity to address the criticism raised by some authors that the definition of the latent class is ambiguous. In our experience, a graphical diagram can help remove this ambiguity by identifying the latent variable being targeted by each imperfect test74. Several statistical tools have been proposed for checking the internal validity of latent class models including checks for goodness-of-fit and for residual conditional dependence71. Identifiability. Many latent class models can be non-identifiable76, i.e. they may not provide a unique solution for the disease prevalence and test accuracy parameters. This is especially likely to happen when the number of imperfect tests is very small (three or fewer) and the available degrees of freedom are less than the number of unknown parameters in a realistic model65. It may also arise if the data are too sparse or the tests observed have poor properties. A Bayesian estimation approach relying on prior information external to the observed data may alleviate the problem in some cases. Often reasonable subjective information may be available about some model parameters, e.g. microbiological tests for TB typically have very high specificity. 30 Chapter 3: Impact of molecular tuberculosis diagnostics on patient-important outcomes: a systematic review of study methodology 3.1 Preface Several reviews on the accuracy of TB Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) have been performed43,77-79 but the evidence on their impact on clinical decision-making and patient-important outcomes has not been systematically reviewed. Given the recent increase in research evaluating such outcomes42,48,80-88 and the growing list of TB NAATs that will reach the market over the coming years89,90, there is a need to bring together the existing evidence on impact, rather than accuracy. Over the past decade, detailed guidance for the conduct91, reporting92, quality assessment93 and on doing systematic reviews and meta-analyses94 of diagnostic accuracy studies have been produced. In contrast, there is no such guidance for studies or reviews of evaluations of diagnostics using outcomes beyond test accuracy. In the following manuscript I try to address some of these gaps. I propose a conceptual framework of relevant patient outcome measures and study designs. I then use these frameworks to structure my systematic review of the available literature on the impact of TB NAATs on patient outcomes and describe the methodological approaches that have been taken to date. I also suggest factors that may be used to assess the risk of bias for the various designs that have been employed and apply it to the studies identified in the systematic review. The following manuscript is in preparation for submission to the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal. 31 3.2 Manuscript Impact of molecular tuberculosis diagnostics on patient-important outcomes: a systematic review of study methodology Samuel 2McGill International TB Centre, 3McGill University, Schulich Library of Science and Engineering 4UCSF Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine 5Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre, Division of Infectious Disease, Boston, MA, USA 32 Abstract Background: Several reviews on the accuracy of TB Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) have been performed but the evidence on their impact on clinical decision-making and patient-important outcomes has not been systematically reviewed. Given the recent increase in research evaluating such outcomes and the growing list of TB NAATs that will reach the market over the coming years, there is a need to bring together the existing evidence on impact, rather than accuracy. Methods: We first develop a conceptual framework to clarify through which mechanisms the improved technical performance of a novel TB test may lead to improved patient outcomes and outline which designs may be used to measure them. We then systematically review the literature on studies attempting to assess the impact of molecular TB diagnostics on such outcomes and provide a narrative synthesis of designs used, outcomes assessed and risk of bias across different study designs. Results: We found 25 eligible studies that assessed a wide range of outcomes and utilized a variety of experimental and observational study designs. Many potentially strong design options had never been used. We found that much of the available evidence on patient-important outcomes comes from a small number of settings with particular epidemiological and operational context and that confounding, time trends and incomplete outcome data receive insufficient attention Conclusions: A broader range of designs should be considered when designing studies to assess the impact of TB diagnostics on patient outcomes and more attention needs to be paid to the analysis as concerns about confounding and selection bias become relevant in addition to those on measurement that are of greatest concern in accuracy studies. 33 Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) continues to have a massive toll on human health globally causing 1.5 million deaths and 9 million new cases annually95. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently set ambitious targets to end the global TB epidemic with accurate and rapid detection of TB and drug resistance as critical components of their strategy25. Improved TB diagnosis is therefore critical for meeting the End TB Strategy goal. Although several new diagnostics are now available for TB, sputum smear microscopy continues to be widely used, despite its limited sensitivity and inability to detect drug-resistance (Kik et al ERJ). Mycobacterial culture has high sensitivity but takes weeks or months to yield results such that its impact on clinical decision-making and patient-important outcomes is often limited29,31,96,97. Newer molecular TB diagnostics (nucleic acid amplification tests, NAATs) have been shown to have good accuracy and can produce rapid results98-100, leading to their endorsement by the WHO101. However, as it has become apparent that higher accuracy does not necessarily translate into improved patient care, policy makers demand more direct evidence that the improved diagnostics positively affect health or other outcomes that matter to patients (such as speed of diagnosis) 9,10,102. However, much confusion remains about how new tests should be implemented to maximize their impact, which patient-important outcomes should be measured and which designs should be used to assess them10,53. Given the recent increase in research evaluating the impact of TB NAATs on patient-important outcomes and the growing list of TB NAATs that will reach the market over the coming years, there is a need to summarize the existing evidence and best practices for methodology103. Various designs have been used to measure a wide range of patient-important outcomes but no systematic review has been done of such studies and the specific methodological issues that arise in them. In this systematic review we aim to critically assess the approaches that have been employed to measure the impact of TB NAATs on patient-important outcomes in adults suspected to have pulmonary TB and/or drug-resistant TB from currently available evidence. Methods The specific objectives of the systematic review were (i) to develop a conceptual framework for the relevant patient-important outcomes and to assess which of these outcomes have been measured 34 in available studies; (ii) to outline which designs and methodologies could theoretically be employed to measure the impact of diagnostics on patient-important outcomes and to assess which of them have been utilized in available studies; (iii) to propose criteria for the assessment of risk of bias for each utilized design based on sound epidemiological principles where such tools don't already exist and to assess the risk of bias and quality of reporting in available studies. We developed a protocol before commencing the review, following standard guidelines104,105. As part of the protocol, we developed a conceptual framework to clarify how the improved technical performance of a test may lead to improved patient health via a number of intermediate outcomes as has been recommended elsewhere106-110. Like others, we felt that inclusion of this conceptual step was important to (i) think carefully through the causal chain that connects improved test characteristics to improved patient outcomes, thereby making assumptions about such links explicit and providing a rationale for the choice of outcomes; to (ii) understand which setting-specific and other contextual factors may modify various links in the causal pathway. We also decided a-priori on a framework for classification of research designs that have been (or could be) used to assess impact. This was based on standard classifications found in textbooks on epidemiology, clinical and diagnostic research111-113 and designs more commonly seen in the economics and social sciences literature114 as well as designs that have only recently been suggested115,116 or not yet been described in the methodological literature to our knowledge. This framework provides structure to the review and points to designs that have not been used. It is also the basis for assessment of risk of bias as threats to validity differ between designs. Eligibility criteria We restricted the review to adult pulmonary TB and drug-resistant TB in this group because diagnosis of childhood and extrapulmonary TB pose very different diagnostic challenges and warrant consideration of additional contextual factors and methodological issues that are beyond the scope of this review. The choice of target condition also reflects the greatest overall burden of disease and greatest public health threat. We focused on the WHO-approved TB NAATs, i.e. two Line Probe assays (the Genotype MTBDRplus and the InnoLPA, both referred to simply as LPAs from here on) and the Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) as these tests are currently of greatest interest globally and are being implemented in many countries around the world. We included only peer-reviewed studies that measured at least one patient-important outcome, i.e. outcomes that 35 directly reflect some improvement in the patient's experience that may directly affect health (such as a more rapid diagnosis, more rapid initiation of treatment, reduced mortality etc.). While cost is an important factor for patients, this was outside of the scope of this review and studies focusing on cost were excluded. We did not exclude any study design as assessment of the range of designs was a goal of the review and we placed no restrictions on region, setting, years or language. We only considered studies that included primary data, i.e. we excluded integrative studies such as meta-analyses, and those based on compartmental models or decision-analytic modeling. Studies that provided diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) outcomes only were excluded. Information sources We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge and Cochrane CENTRAL up until January, 2015. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the search portal of the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to identify ongoing trials. No language restrictions were applied. The full electronic search strategy can be found in Appendix A. To identify additional studies, we reviewed reference lists of included articles identified through the above methods, reviewed reference lists of diagnostic accuracy systematic reviews on the NAATs assessed in this\u0001 review and contacted researchers at the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), members of the Stop TB Partnership's New Diagnostics Working Group, and other experts in the field of TB diagnostics. Study selection Two review authors (SGS and ZQ) independently assessed titles and abstracts identified by electronic literature searching to identify potentially eligible studies (screen 1). Any citation identified by either review author during screen 1 was selected for full-text review. Next, we retrieved the full paper of each potentially eligible article identified in the search. Two review authors (SGS and HS) independently assessed articles for inclusion using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria (screen 2). In screen 2, any discrepancies were resolved by discussion between the review authors. We maintained a list of excluded studies and their reasons for exclusion. 36 Data collection process and data items We developed a standardized data extraction form using Google Forms (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) to minimize the risk of errors during data entry117. Two review authors (SGS, HS) piloted the form and revised to further improve clarity and then independently extracted data on a quarter (6/25) of studies. For the remainder of the studies, one review author (SGS) extracted the data and a second review author (HS) crosschecked all extracted items. We extracted data on study design, key contextual factors, patient-important outcomes assessed, main results for these outcomes and on pre-defined, design-specific items for assessment of risk of bias. Risk of bias in individual studies We assessed risk of bias of individual studies with component questions for risk of bias assessment dependent on the study design. For randomized controlled trials we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool 118. For the other study designs there is currently no suitable validated tool for risk of bias assessment119. We therefore decided on methodological components separately for each study design that likely place a study at higher risk of bias. Our choices were informed by other existing tools for risk of bias assessment 93,120,121, approaches taken by health technology assessment units122-124 as well as generally recognized epidemiological and statistical principles111. The design-specific questions and guidance for how to judge each item is available in Appendix B. We did not attempt any assessment of risk of bias across studies. Synthesis of results We present an overview of included studies in a summary table, grouped by design and index test. Due to the heterogeneity of designs used, outcomes measured, tests evaluated and important contextual factors that modify the impact of tests, we did not plan to do a meta-analysis. Instead we provide a narrative synthesis of results, structured around the conceptual frameworks we developed for the outcomes and study designs. We used descriptive statistics to summarize key contextual factors, the frequency with which the various study designs were used and the frequency with which the various outcomes were assessed (overall and by study design). We used vote counting to assess how often authors reported that use of the TB NAAT positively influenced a particular outcome. We display results from the assessment of risk of bias graphically for each study design both across 37 included studies and for each individual included study. Data management and descriptive statistics were done using STATA (version 12, Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA). Additional analyses If authors reported that use of the TB NAAT \"did not change\" outcomes but supported this statement only with a point-estimate and p-value, i.e. if they did not provide a confidence interval for the difference in effect measure between arms, we calculated confidence intervals based on the raw data if available in the study report to determine if the study was indeed able to rule out a clinically important effect. Results Study selection Figure 1 shows the study selection flow chart. We screened the 7,995 abstracts that remained after removal of duplicates and identified 107 potentially eligible articles for which we obtained the full texts. We excluded 85 articles due to reasons listed in figure 1. We identified three additional studies, and this led to a total of 25 included studies. Study characteristics and contextual factors Of the 25 included studies (tables 1 and 2), ten (40%) were done in South Africa or involved a study site in South Africa as part of a multi-center study. Most studies were carried out in urban hospitals (52%, n=13) or urban primary care centers (28%, n=7) with chest radiography being available as one of the diagnostic modalities for TB in almost three quarters of the studies (72%, n=18). Of the 22 studies providing results from HIV-testing, 12 (55%) reported HIV prevalence greater than 50% in their study cohort. Rates of loss to follow-up before treatment initiation were reported in 10 studies and ranged from 7% to 39%. The proportion of patients treated empirically (i.e. without microbiological confirmation) was reported in 12 studies and ranged from 10% to 69%. Samples were transported for off-site testing in a laboratory in a different location than where patient care took place in 12 studies (48%), and were tested on-site in the other 12 (location was 38 unclear in the one remaining study). Of the 18 studies evaluating Xpert\u2014a test yielding results within 2h\u2014only four (22%) attempted to implement the test embedded within a point-of-care testing program, where the goal is same-day treatment initiation. No other co-interventions aimed at ensuring or improving the continuum of care\u2014from patient screening, through diagnostic testing, providing the TB or alternative diagnosis, ensuring linkage to care (avoiding loss to follow-up), initiating TB or alternative treatment, providing support for treatment adherence and ensuring successful treatment outcomes\u2014were reported. 39 Figure 1.

For clarity, and for consistency with what has been suggested previously142, we differentiate four categories of outcome measures based on their object of study and required follow-up as indicated at the bottom of the figure: (i) measures of technical performance, (ii) measures of diagnostic impact, (iii) measures of therapeutic impact and (iv) measures of patient outcome impact. Measures of technical performance (e.g. test accuracy) were often reported but not the focus of this review. The frequency of reporting of the various patient-important outcomes across included studies is shown in figure 3. The most common measure of diagnostic impact was the 'number of patients with confirmed diagnosis' (28%, n=7). We found that most studies included at least one measure of therapeutic impact with 'reduced time to treatment initiation' representing by far the most commonly used outcome measure overall (84%, n=21), followed by 'reduced loss to follow-up' (36%, n=9). Only about half of studies (n=13) reported on a measure of patient outcome impact, mostly on mortality (24%, n=6) and outcomes related to infection control or contact tracing (20%, n=5). Figure 2.

Reporting and vote counting of results on the different outcome measures. Green circles represent findings that the TB NAAT improved the outcome, yellow circles represent inconclusive findings where confidence intervals of the effect estimate included clinically relevant improvements or where confidence intervals were not provided and raw data for re-calculation was not accessible from the manuscript. Note: One study assessed both Xpert and LPA and is accounted for in both the upper section on Xpert and the lower section on LPA; some outcomes shown in figure 2 were not reported in any study No studies assessed the potential effects on increasing the number of diagnoses of other respiratory diseases, the number of patients treated with an effective regimen or Health-related quality of life measures. While included studies universally (100%, 14/14) showed benefit of the TB NAATs on the assessed measures of diagnostic impact and none showed any harm, only about three quarters (76%, 29/38) of measures of therapeutic impact were shown to improve and only half (50%, 8/16) of measures of patient outcome impact. None (0%, 0/7) of the studies was able to show a benefit on morbidity or mortality. However, point-estimates for changes in mortality and other measures of patient outcome impact often suggested improvements in the TB NAAT arm, but since these !!Diagnostic!Impact!!!Therapeutic!Impact!!Patient!outcome!Impact!!Time!to!diagnosis!Nr.!of!TB!patients!provided!with!confirmed!diagnosis!Nr.!of!TB!patients!provided!with!resistance!profile!!Time!to!treatment!Pre9treatment!loss!to!follow9up!Nr.!of!TB!patients!treated!Improved!rule9out!/!reduction!in!over9treatment!for!TB!!Culture!conversion!TB!treatment!outcomes!Infection!control!/contact!tracing!Morbidity!Mortality!Xpert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LPA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Green!circles!represent!findings!that!the!TB!NAAT!improved!the!outcome,!yellow!circles!represent!inconclusive!findings!where!confidence!intervals!of!the!effect!estimate!included!clinically!relevant!improvements!or!where!confidence!intervals!were!not!provided!and!raw!data!for!re9calculation!was!not!accessible!from!the!manuscript.!!Note:!One!study!assessed!both!Xpert!and!LPA!and!is!accounted!for!in!both!the!upper!section!on!Xpert!and!the!lower!section!on!LPA;!some!outcomes!shown!in!figure!2!were!not!reported!in!any!study!!+++++++++??++++++?++?+++++?+?++++?+?++++??+++++????+++++?+?++++++++? 44 outcomes are relatively rare, confidence intervals were wide such that a \"null-effect\" could not be excluded. Unfortunately this was frequently interpreted as \"no difference between arms\" but wide intervals that include the null should not be interpreted as evidence favoring the null hypothesis (absence of evidence is not evidence of absence143,144). For example, if a mortality-reduction of 25% or more is considered important from a clinical or public health standpoint, all findings on this outcome were inconclusive, rather than proving the absence of any relevant effect. Designs to assess impact of diagnostic tests The classification of design options as used in this review is shown in figure 4. We first differentiate two major design architectures: (i) multi-cohort designs, i.e. designs that involve two (or more) cohorts, each exposed to only a single test or testing algorithm and (ii) single-cohort designs, i.e. designs that involve a single cohort exposed to multiple tests simultaneously. We then further differentiate important sub-types of these and brief descriptions for each design with references for further details are provided in table 3. Of note, quasi-experimental studies are not typically described in epidemiological textbooks but are popular among economists and other social scientists: the basic idea of these designs is to try to make causal inference by exploiting some source of exogenous variation that acts similar to randomization. The three designs listed here may appear to be quite different but have the common feature that the type of exposure/test is neither the choice of the study participants (as in traditional cohort studies) nor assigned by the investigator (as in randomized trials) but determined through some exogenous factor. Pre/post implementation studies, where 'time' represents this exogenous factor, were the only quasi-experimental design used in the included studies. As shown in table 3, we identified two individually-randomized trials, two parallel-arm cluster-randomized trials and one stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial. There were nine studies using a quasi-experimental design, all of which were uncontrolled pre/post implementation studies. We also found four single-cohort hypothetical studies and seven single-cohort observational studies but no diagnostic before/after studies. Authors did not provide any name for their study design in three studies and 13 different names were suggested by study authors for the remaining 17 non-randomized studies. RCTs tended to assess outcomes across the whole range (i.e. from diagnostic impact to patient outcome impact) while pre/post and observational studies mostly assessed therapeutic impact and hypothetical studies mostly patient outcomes (figure 5). 45 Figure 4. Design options to study the impact of TB diagnostics on patient health outcomes. Designs that have not been used in any of the studies included in this review are shown in grey. Figure 5.

Descriptions of design options to study the impact of TB diagnostics on patient-important outcomes with references on methodological issues. 47 Risk of bias within studies Results from the assessment of risk of bias are shown separately for each study design across included studies in figure 6 and for each individual included study in Appendix C. For all designs incomplete outcome data was more common for measures of patient outcome impact than for outcomes further upstream in the causal chain. Where outcome data was missing, regression adjustment, imputation or sensitivity analyses were rarely attempted and this may have led to bias in some studies172-174. For all randomized trials, blinding of physicians to what test was done was impossible since knowing which test was done is part of the intervention itself. For example, the Xpert test has higher sensitivity than smear microscopy (and also produces RIF resistance results) and physicians must be allowed to take this into account when deciding about patient management. While outcomes between patients may therefore be different due to lack of blinding this was not judged to be a source of bias but rather the mechanism through which the intervention had an effect. Outcome measurement could theoretically have been influenced by the lack of blinding but this was deemed unlikely to cause bias of important magnitude. Overall, the lack of blinding was therefore judged not to put studies at increased risk of bias. Allocation concealment was impossible for cluster RCTs since once a cluster had been assigned to one of the intervention arms, allocation of this cluster was fixed and therefore unconcealed for the remainder of the study. However, if this had led to selection bias one would expect to see relevant covariate-imbalance between the intervention arms-this was not observed and therefore bias of important magnitude from this source is relatively unlikely. For pre/post implementation studies, changes of patient eligibility criteria that occurred concurrently to the change of test used in the pre versus the post period were an important threat to validity. This was usually the result of a policy broadening eligibility for drug-resistance testing from a high-risk group in the pre period to all patients in whom TB was suspected in the post period, implemented alongside the introduction of the TB NAAT. The selection bias that can result from this may be hard or impossible to address analytically. Time trends (usually changes in quality of care or care delivery) pose another potential risk of bias and study authors sometimes discussed this. A figure explaining how these mechanisms lead to lack of exchangeability and how this could potentially be addressed analytically is shown in Appendix D. Only three studies addressed the potential for confounding by providing justification why outcomes were likely unaffected or through 48 some additional analysis. A table comparing pre/post cohorts was often shown but attempts to address existing covariate imbalances, e.g. via regression, were rare. If adjustment was attempted, methods were often described in insufficient detail (e.g. no explanation how continuous covariates were modeled175,176) and strategies for model selection were either not described or a method known to be prone to bias was used (e.g. inclusion based on p<0.05)177-180. As mentioned earlier, controlled pre/post implementation studies (and extensions via matched cohort designs181) were not done but would be preferable to increase robustness of estimates. Figure 6. Assessment of risk of bias for each study design across included studies. !RCTs! !Pre/post!implementation!studies!!Hypothetical!studies!!Observational!studies!!!!! 49 Since in single-cohort studies comparisons are made within individuals, confounding and selection bias are not the main concern. The challenge for these designs lies in the assumptions one needs to make to draw valid conclusions about the effect of the index test. For the single-cohort observational studies, assumptions remained implicit and were probably often not justified. For example, patients testing negative on smear microscopy but positive with the TB NAAT were usually assumed to have received TB therapy due to the TB NAAT; however, this implicitly assumes that none of these patients would have been treated empirically, which is unlikely to hold true in most settings, leading to overestimates in the value of the test in placing more patients on therapy. In contrast, in Hypothetical studies assumptions were made explicit and risk of bias was overall low. This may in part reflect the fact that authors of Hypothetical studies clearly aimed to estimate causal effects of TB NAATs, while authors of observational studies were perhaps simply aiming to provide some description of the use of these tests and had less clearly specified objectives in terms of what they were trying to estimate. We did not explicitly evaluate the potential for measurement bias because we did not feel that this was a big concern in general, which would need to be assessed for each individual study. However, we emphasize that the lack of a gold standard for TB (even mycobacterial culture has imperfect sensitivity) complicates the interpretation of outcomes such as the 'number of patients put on treatment', as this is only a proxy for the 'number of true TB patients put on treatment'. Use of this proxy leads to some degree of bias towards the Null like any measurement error that introduces noise into effect estimation182. Importantly though, it also has additional potential to introduce measurement bias towards the Null because empiric therapy is more common in the baseline arm (using smear microscopy), which likely leads to more non-TB patients put on TB treatment than in the TB NAAT arm. These are then counted as TB patients, thus seemingly improving the performance of the baseline arm, while actually representing in part over-treatment. It may be worthwhile to explore simple adjustments for this in sensitivity analyses in future studies183,184, using a range of estimates of the accuracy of empiric therapy. Directness of evidence and generalizability In addition to assessing risk of bias, it is also important to assess how directly the evidence applies to the research question and various \"types\" of indirectness have been described185. For this review we provide a brief conceptual assessment of indirectness as it relates to differences in 50 outcome measures (surrogate outcomes). We did not assess directness on an individual-study basis, as this is a function of the outcome, rather than of the study design: some outcomes may provide very direct evidence for impact on patient health (e.g. mortality); other outcomes are much further upstream in the causal chain that eventually leads to improving patient health (e.g. time to diagnosis). We note that studies evaluating outcomes that provide very direct evidence for impacting patient outcomes may be-on average-more prone to confounding and selection bias and may lead to results that are less easily generalizable. The risk of confounding is likely increased because the number of covariates that have an influence on downstream outcomes (for which balance between compared cohorts needs to be ensured) increases. The risk of selection bias increases because the required length of follow-up increases as one assesses further downstream outcomes. Generalizability of specific estimates may become increasingly questionable because the role of contextual factors that vary from setting to setting also have increasing influence on the further downstream outcomes. In contrast, studies providing only very indirect evidence may have lower risk of bias but require much stronger assumptions if we try to extrapolate from their findings to make statements about downstream patient outcomes. In general it is therefore important to take both risk of bias and applicability into account to come to an overall conclusion about the likely impact of diagnostic tests on patient outcomes. We show this trade-off in simplified form in figure 7. Of note, a similar trade-off exists between study designs: the main threat to validity for multi-cohort designs come from confounding and selection bias while the single-cohort designs only yield useful inference if one can make and justify the assumptions they require. 51 Figure 7. Directness of outcome measures, risk of bias and generalizability. In general, we would like to measure outcomes towards the right of this figure, providing direct evidence for improved patient outcomes and thus obviating the need for strong assumptions and extrapolation. However, as we \"move to the right\" in the causal chain, the number of variables potentially affecting the outcome increase (e.g. mortality is affected by a larger number of factors than time to diagnosis), such that greater care is required in assessing and/or adjusting for covariate-imbalance. Similarly, the number of contextual factors that has an effect on outcomes (e.g. weak health systems) increases, potentially reducing generalizability. Discussion In this systematic review of the impact of molecular tuberculosis diagnostics on patient-important outcomes, we describe important challenges when choosing outcomes and designs. We describe the options that exist, the threats to validity that come with each choice and make some suggestions to further raise methodological standards in design, analysis and interpretation of results. We found that much of the available evidence on patient-important outcomes comes from a small number of settings with particular epidemiological and operational context. Therefore, general conclusions about \"the impact of TB NAATs\" should be made with caution. The settings are not necessarily representative of the global TB epidemiology but probably more a reflection of where Increasing potential for risk of bias(due to increasing difculty in avoiding confounding & selection bias)Decreasing need for strong assumptions to make inference(due to increasing directness of outcome measures)Diagnostic generalizability(due to increasing influence of contextual factors) 52 research is most feasible due to availability of trained personnel, expertise and interest in research methodology, and a belief about where the impact of the evaluated tests may be greatest. Few studies assessed new tests implemented as part of point-of-care testing programs12 and none aimed at ensuring a continuum of TB care. The problem of a cascade of care has been described extensively in the HIV literature186 and it is becoming apparent that a similar problem exists in TB programs187 and point-of-care testing in global health in general 188. Future studies and indeed TB programs may need to take a more holistic approach in order for novel tests to reach their full potential in improving patient and population health. Included studies looked at a large variety of outcomes but \"time to treatment initiation\" was by far the most common one. Most studies showed benefit of TB NAATs and studies that did not show benefit were usually inconclusive (rather than affirming true absence of benefit) although this was generally poorly reported. Effect estimates should always be accompanied by Confidence Intervals189 and resampling methods (such as the non-parametric bootstrap190) may be used if simple procedures to obtain them are not directly available in software packages. There is a trade-off when choosing outcome measures: on the one hand one may try to measure effects on patient health very directly, which can come at greater risk of confounding, selection bias and difficulty to generalize to other settings; on the other hand one may resort to measure effects on patient health very indirectly, which can avoid or lower these risks but any conclusions about actual effects on patient health then require us to make a number of potentially untenable assumptions that are needed to such extrapolations. This is in fact a problem that health technology assessment units are routinely facing when trying to decide whether a new diagnostic test or screening program should be introduced106,119,124,191. High-quality evidence showing positive effects directly on patient outcomes is usually lacking which often leads assessors to use decision-analytic modeling as a way to integrate different pieces of evidence55,115,192, and this approach may also be fruitful when assessing the value of TB diagnostics. While randomized trials provide the strongest counterfactual, non-randomized studies will likely continue to play an important part in providing evidence on effects on patient-important outcomes. However, stronger non-randomized designs that can be based on routine data sources remain unused so far but may be well-suited for high-quality operational research studies and their use should be explored in future research. Missing outcome data was a relatively frequent problem and greater efforts should be made to address it using established methods172-174. Pre/post implementation studies suffered from selection bias and confounding, but either no attempt was 53 made to address this analytically or attempts were methodologically problematic. Hypothetical trials \u2014if feasible\u2014 can be an attractive option to estimate impact on patient outcomes by extrapolating more formally from test performance data based on explicitly stated and justified assumptions115. Observational studies are probably not very suitable for inference on impact on patient outcomes but may still provide valuable insights about how tests are used in various settings. We aimed to review the methodology of studies assessing two classes of TB NAATs, using a variety of study designs to measure a large number of different outcomes in settings with very different epidemiological and operational context. The multitude of these variables are both a strength and a weakness of our review as this allowed great breadth but limited depth in discussing methodological issues and their potential effects in making overall conclusions about the impact of the tests on patient-important outcomes. We included non-randomized designs for which no validated tool to assess the risk of bias existed. The tools we used have not been validated and it is possible that relevant criteria were omitted or that other improvements could be made to our assessment of risk of bias. However, our tool was based on extensive search and review of the literature on assessing risk of bias in intervention studies, particularly those involving diagnostics122-124 and included simple yes/no questions with explicit guidance on how to make judgments, as has been recommended for the development of new risk-of-bias tools122. Our focus on adult pulmonary TB and WHO-approved NAATs was mostly a pragmatic decision and while we believe that many of our conclusions will apply to other tests, other forms of TB and indeed other infectious diseases, additional considerations will be relevant for other areas of research. We focused on studies based on primary data but modeling studies have a key role in assessing patient (and population) impact as well. General advice on methodology for such studies exist 192-195 and an assessment of how they have been implemented in the case of point of care testing strategies for active tuberculosis196 and for Interferon-gamma release assays for latent TB infection197 have been published. In conclusion, generating evidence on the impact of molecular TB diagnostics on patient-important outcomes is challenging and there is no simple or ideal choice for design or outcome. Choices will often be dictated by availability of routine data or limitations in funding to carry out primary data collection but an awareness of the trade-offs in choosing outcomes and designs will hopefully help make the best choices possible. Some designs that have the potential to yield strong evidence without requiring large-scale primary data collection have not been used to date and may 54 have great potential for future research. Once data are collected, doing the best possible job during analysis is comparatively cheap and should always be possible. As the analytic challenges are very different from those in accuracy research, including a methodologist during data analysis and ideally also early during study planning is important. 55 Appendices Appendix A.

Design-specific risk of bias tools used and guidance for judgment as \"yes\", \"no\" or \"unclear\". RCTs (based on Cochrane risk of bias tool) Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? Yes The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: Referring to a random number table; Using a computer random number generator; Coin of lots; Minimization*. *Minimization may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent to being random. No The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: Sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; Sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; Sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number. Other non-random approaches happen much less frequently than the systematic approaches mentioned above and tend to be obvious. They usually involve judgement or some method of non-random categorization of participants, for example: Allocation by judgement of the clinician; Allocation by preference of the participant; Allocation based on the results of a laboratory test or a series of tests; Allocation by availability of the intervention. Unclear Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Yes' or 'No' Was allocation adequately concealed? Yes Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: Central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomization); Sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. No Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: Using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); Assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or nonopaque or not sequentially numbered); Alternation or rotation; Date of birth; Case record number; Any other explicitly unconcealed procedure. Unclear Insufficient information to permit judgement of 'Yes' or 'No'. This is usually the 59 case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement - for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed. Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study? Yes Any one of the following: No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken; Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others unlikely to introduce bias. No Any one of the following: No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken; Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, and the non-blinding of others likely to introduce bias. Unclear Any one of the following: Insufficient information to permit judgement of 'Yes' or 'No'; The study did not address this outcome. Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? Yes No missing outcome data; Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups; table of participants without missing outcome data presented, showing balance of relevant covariates For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size; Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods. No Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate; For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size; Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation. Unclear Any one of the following: Insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit judgement of 'Yes' or 'No' (e.g. number randomized not stated, no reasons for missing data provided); The study did not address this outcome. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? Yes Any of the following: 60 The study protocol is available and all of the study's pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way; The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon). No Any one of the following: Not all of the study's pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported; One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified; One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study. Unclear Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Yes' or 'No'. It is likely that the majority of studies will fall into this category. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a risk of bias? Yes The study appears to be free of other sources of bias. No There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study: Had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; or Stopped early due to some data-dependent process (including a formal-stopping rule); or Had extreme baseline imbalance; or Has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or Had some other problem. Unclear There may be a risk of bias, but there is either: Insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists; or Insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias. Pre/post implementation studies Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled? Yes authors state consecutive or random recruitment AND patients' disease (or resistance) status was unknown at enrollment No authors state recruitment strategy other than random/consecutive OR patients' disease (or resistance) status was already known based at enrollment, e.g. only smear-positive patients Unclear Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Yes' or 'No' Were selection criteria the same across different cohorts? Yes there is no indication of differing selection criteria across the different cohorts, e.g. if recruitment was prospectively done as part of a research project that recruited patients based on rigorous inclusion criteria No there is strong reason to believe or clear evidence of differing selection criteria across the different cohorts, e.g. due to changes in policy for test eligibility alongside introduction of a new test in routine practice Unclear Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Yes' or 'No' Yes Was exchangeability assessed and addressed?

Improved diagnostic tests like the Xpert are believed improve TB control26,42,198, especially if employed in a system that allows same-day treatment initiation to minimize early losses to follow-up46,199,200. However, it is unclear if Xpert can be employed successfully as part of a point-of-care (POC) testing strategy and if accuracy will remain high if performed by a minimally trained health worker outside of a traditional microbiology laboratory46. Employing Xpert for testing in a clinic with a high prevalence of TB, along with optimized delivery of results, may enable same-day diagnosis. In the following manuscript I try to answer these questions by estimating accuracy of Xpert when implemented within a POC testing program and by comparing time to diagnosis between 'routine Xpert implementation' to 'POC Xpert implementation' thus contributing knowledge POC amenability of Xpert and about relative contribution of better tests versus better implementation. The following manuscript is scheduled for publication in the September issue of the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. 70 4.2 Manuscript Impact of point-of-care implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF: product versus 1McGill Department Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Montreal, QC, Canada 2McGill International TB Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada 3Christian Medical College Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Vellore, India 4Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre, Division of Infectious Disease, Boston, MA, USA 5Christian Medical College Department of Microbiology, Vellore, India 6 Stanford University Department of Pathology, Stanford, CA, USA 71 Abstract Background: Both product innovation (e.g. more sensitive tests) and process innovation (e.g. a point-of-care (POC) testing program) could improve patient outcomes. Objective: To study the respective contributions of product and process innovation in improving patient outcomes. Design: We implemented a POC program using Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) in an outpatient clinic of an Indian tertiary-care hospital. We measured process innovation impact by comparing time to diagnosis between 'routine' versus POC testing. We measured product innovation impact by comparing accuracy and time to diagnosis between smears versus POC Xpert. Results: We enrolled 1,012 patients during a 15-month period. Xpert had high accuracy but the incremental value of one Xpert over two smears was only 6% (95%CI 3-12). Implementing Xpert as a routine laboratory test did not reduce time to diagnosis compared to smear-based diagnosis. In contrast, the POC program did reduce time to diagnosis by 5.5 days (95% CI 4.3-6.7) but required dedicated staff and substantial adaptation of clinic workflow. Conclusion: Process innovation by way of a POC Xpert program had a bigger impact on time to diagnosis than the product per se and can yield important improvements in patient care that are complementary to those achieved by introducing innovative technologies. 72 INTRODUCTION The global burden of tuberculosis (TB) remains large with almost nine million new cases and 1.5 million deaths occurring each year.95 An estimated three million cases went either undiagnosed or unreported in 2013.95 This is thought to be in part due to shortcomings of conventional diagnostic tests. While smear microscopy is insensitive and cannot detect drug-resistance, culture results frequently do not influence treatment decisions or patients are lost to follow-up before culture results become available.29,31,97 Xpert MTB/RIF (\"Xpert\", Cepheid Inc, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is more sensitive than smear microscopy, includes detection of rifampin resistance and can give results within two hours.41,42 This makes it a promising tool both to increase diagnostic yield and for implementation within point-of-care (POC) testing programs,12,188,201 which may reduce pre-treatment loss to follow-up.202 The accuracy of Xpert for adult pulmonary tuberculosis has been studied extensively43 but accuracy is only a surrogate measure for patient-important outcomes such as reduced time to diagnosis or improved treatment decisions.9,10 More direct evidence that a new test will benefit patients is important for decisions about scale-up,9 as the impact of a test might be heavily dependent on context and implementation strategy.187,199,200,203 Two randomized controlled trials recently compared treatment initiation with Xpert versus smear microscopy,125,126 and showed that increased sensitivity might not directly translate into proportional improvements in patient-important outcomes. The effect of different implementation strategies of Xpert to maximize patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness have been modeled,187,200,203,204 but empiric data are limited. Few studies have evaluated Xpert use within a POC program, and no study to date has directly compared routine, laboratory-based implementation with POC implementation of Xpert.47,48,85,125 We aimed to assess (i) the impact of product innovation by evaluating the technical performance of Xpert performed outside of a routine laboratory, by a minimally trained health worker compared to smear microscopy and liquid culture and (ii) the impact of process innovation by evaluating the effect of implementing Xpert within a POC program compared to its use as a routine laboratory test on reductions in diagnostic delay. 73 METHODS Setting and study population The study was performed at the Christian Medical College Hospital (CMC) in Vellore, India. We included patients 18 years or older who presented with at least 2 weeks of cough or other symptoms suggestive of pulmonary TB at the pulmonary outpatient clinic. All routine testing was done in the Department of Microbiology at CMC, which is accredited through the Indian Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP). The department offers Xpert MTB/RIF testing routinely ('routine Xpert') since August 2012, and has participated in several international, multicenter studies.42 POC program Between March 2013 and June 2014 we implemented a POC program for Xpert testing. We deployed a new four-module Xpert machine near the pulmonary outpatient clinic, aiming to reduce diagnostic delays and enable same-day diagnosis and treatment initiation. Xpert was performed by an operator with no prior laboratory training, who received two days of training on biosafety and Xpert testing procedures. Care delivery within the POC program involved (i) expedited sample receipt and transport; (ii) rapid testing of the sample upon arrival in the POC lab; (iii) rapid reporting of test results by calling the physician's mobile phone and (iv) rapid follow-up of patients to communicate test results and initiate treatment for TB for Xpert-positive patients. Study design We performed (i) a cross-sectional study to assess the impact of product innovation and (ii) a pre/post implementation study to assess the impact of process innovation. Ethics approval was obtained from the IRBs of the Christian Medical College in Vellore, India and McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, Canada. Consent was obtained from all prospectively enrolled patients and it was waived for use of de-identified data from historic, routine medical records. 74 Impact of product innovation: cross-sectional study of Xpert MTB/RIF The cross-sectional study involved measuring improvements in patient care achieved through implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF compared to existing tests. The impact of product innovation was measured by assessing the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampin-resistance compared to liquid and solid culture, and the incremental value and time to diagnosis compared to smear microscopy. Time to diagnosis was defined as the interval between the day the patient presented with TB symptoms and the day that test results were communicated to the patient. Participants were asked to provide a spot sputum sample on which Xpert and routine testing via direct fluorescence microscopy as well as liquid (MGIT 960) and solid culture (Loewenstein Jensen) were performed. Additional samples were obtained per routine clinical care for second and third sputum smears on subsequent days. Positive cultures underwent drug susceptibility testing (DST) using both liquid (MGIT SIRE) and solid culture. If patients were unable to spontaneously expectorate sputum, an induced sputum sample was obtained saline (3%). Impact of process innovation: pre/post implementation study of the POC program The pre/post implementation study involved measuring reductions in diagnostic delay achieved through changes in care delivery (a POC testing program). The impact of process innovation was measured by comparing median time to diagnosis before ('routine Xpert') and after the implementation of the POC program ('POC Xpert'). We defined pre-test processes as those involving sample submission and transport; lab processes as those involving sample reception in the lab, test procedures and result recording; and post-test processes as those involving reporting to physicians and patient follow-up. We also obtained time to treatment initiation through direct contact and self-report during the 'POC Xpert' phase. A line listing of all eligible patients from the 'routine Xpert' phase was obtained for the period between October 2012 and February 2013 and a random sample of 120 patients was drawn using the procedure for simple random sampling in STATA. For these patients, test results were obtained from electronic medical records and dates of patient visits as well as basic clinical and demographic information via chart abstraction. 75 Statistical analysis Diagnostic accuracy of Xpert was assessed comparing to one liquid and one solid culture as reference standard. Incremental value of Xpert over smear microscopy was calculated as the number of minus the number of true-positives by smear microscopy divided by the number of positive culture results. Assessment of accuracy and incremental value excluded contaminated cultures, failed Xpert tests and smear positive culture-negative test results. Plots of the Kaplan-Meier estimator were used to compare cumulative time to diagnosis.205 Confidence intervals around the difference in median time to diagnosis were calculated with the non-parametric bootstrap190. We chose not to perform statistical testing as we felt confidence intervals to be more informative than p-values; note however that confidence intervals around the difference in median time to diagnosis that exclude zero could be considered statistically significant differences at alpha 0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA (version 12, Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA). RESULTS Study Population We prospectively enrolled 1,012 consecutive, eligible patients between March 2013 and June 2014 for testing in within the POC testing program. The median age was 47 (IQR 34 - 60), 29% were female and most patients came from outside the province (Table 1). Many patients had symptoms suggesting relatively late-stage disease with 17% testing culture-positive of which 76% were smear-positive. Almost a third of patients (31%) had been treated for TB previously and 19% reported having diabetes. More than a quarter (28%) was unable to expectorate a sample spontaneously and underwent sputum induction. Only 50% of participants reported ever having had an HIV-test and only 2% of those tested reported having received a positive result. 76 Table 1 POC study population Variables n % Participants total 1,012 100 Age categorized 18-29 177 17 30-49 391 39 50-69 376 37 70-120 68 7 Sex Female 303 29 Male 709 71 Cough Yes 933 93 No 68 7 Fever Yes 439 44 No 564 56 Loss of weight Yes 500 50 No 501 50 Hemoptysis Yes 353 35 No 648 65 Night sweats Yes 103 10 No 896 90 State of permanent residence Tamil Nadhu 402 41 Other 578 59 Previous TB Yes 316 31 No 671 66 Induced sputum Yes 283 28 No 729 72 Note: Percentages are given out of total with known values; where numbers don't add up to 1,012 this is due to missing values; where percentages don't add up to 100% this is due to rounding errors. Impact of product innovation: Xpert MTB/RIF We prospectively enrolled 1,012 consecutive, eligible patients between March 2013 and June 2014 for testing in within the POC testing program (Table 1). Sensitivity and specificity of Xpert for 77 MTB detection were 85% (95%CI 78 - 90) and 97% (95% CI 96 - 98) respectively. While specificity did not vary between subgroups, sensitivity was lower in smear-negative and induced sputum samples (Table 2). Culture detected seven cases of Rifampin resistance and Xpert sensitivity for detection of Rifampin-resistance was 100% (95%CI 59, 100) and specificity was 96% (95%CI 91, 99). The incremental value of Xpert over smear microscopy was 6% (95% CI 3 - 12) when considering all available smear results (median number of smear results per patient was 2, IQR 2 - 3). The incremental value over the first smear only was 11% (95% CI 5 - 20). No data on accuracy was available for Xpert testing in the routine laboratory as the reference standard was often not performed during routine care. Table 2 Diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF, compared to cultures Analysis Sensitivity (95%CI) Specificity (95%CI) Overall 85% (78, 90) 97% (96, 98) (85, 99) - Smear-negative 55% (95, By sample type Spontaneously 90% (83, 95) 98% (96, 99) Induced sputum 69% (50, 84) 95% (91, 98) Note: Results from samples that tested positive on smear and negative on culture (n=29) were excluded from the calculation of accuracy; therefore there is no specificity estimate in the smear-positive subgroup. 14 samples yielded invalid on Xpert and we obtained a valid result for 13 of them upon repeat testing. 2-3% of cultures were contaminated on both the MGIT tube and the Loewenstein-Jensen slope, and these were excluded from the analysis. Simultaneous stratification by smear-status and sample type was omitted, as small cell numbers would lead to large imprecision in sensitivity-estimates for Xpert, making meaningful inference impossible. During the pre-POC program implementation period, i.e. when Xpert was performed like any other test for TB in the microbiology department, the median time to diagnosis was 6 days (IQR 4 - 7.5) for patients receiving smear microscopy only and 6.5 days (IQR 4 - 10) for patients receiving 78 smear microscopy as well as Xpert (Figure, Panel A). Only 2% of patients received an Xpert result within one day of testing (15% by day two and 62% by day seven). Figure. Product and process impact on diagnostic delay. Panel A shows the time to communication of test results during the period where testing was done per routine procedures in the microbiology laboratory, i.e. before implementation of the POC program. The solid line shows results for patients diagnosed using smear microscopy and the dashed line shows results for patients diagnosed using Xpert. Panel B compares the time to diagnosis using Xpert pre and post implementation of the POC program. The solid line shows results for patients diagnosed with Xpert per routine procedures in the microbiology laboratory, i.e. before implementation of the POC testing program; the dashed line shows results for patients diagnosed with Xpert within the POC testing program. Impact of process innovation: POC program The POC program reduced the median time from presentation at the hospital to communication of Xpert test results to patients to 1 day (IQR 0 - 1). This reflects a reduction by 5.5 days (95% CI 4.3 - 6.7) compared to routine Xpert testing, and a reduction of 5 days (95% CI 3.8 - 6.2) compared to routine smears. This reduction was mostly due to lower post-testing delays but also due to reduced turn-around time in the laboratory and pre-testing delay (Table 3). 4AB0%25%50%75%100%cumulative % diagnoses communicated051015202530DaysRoutine XpertPOC impact: Xpert vs Smear 79 With the implementation of the POC program, 32% of patients were provided their Xpert test result on the day of presentation. This proportion increased to 75% and 89% on the subsequent two days. (Figure, Panel B). The delay of one or two days was mostly due to samples being submitted in the afternoon (40%) and thus test results being provided at the DOTS clinic the following morning. We were able to obtain the date of treatment initiation for 112/185 patients that tested positive on Xpert during the POC program period. For these patients, the median time to TB treatment initiation after receipt of test results was 3 days (IQR 1 - 8). All patients testing positive with Xpert were prescribed TB medication at their visit to the DOTS clinic and initiated treatment either on the same day (23%) or when they reached their local DOTS center (77%). Some of the delay was due to doctors deferring treatment initiation until results from liver function tests were available. Table 3 Diagnostic delays pre and post implementation of POC testing program Pre-test processes Lab processes Post-test processes Total process Routine completion 4 (0-1) 0 (0-1) 1 (0-1) Note: Pre-test processes may lead to delays due to sample submission and transport; lab processes may lead to delays due to sample reception in the lab, test procedures and result recording; post-test processes may lead to delays due to result reporting to physicians and patient follow-up. 80 DISCUSSION This study demonstrates that process innovation (e.g. in form of a POC program) can be more effective in reducing time to diagnosis than product innovation (e.g. a rapid test). In the study setting, implementation of a POC program reduced time to diagnosis by about six days while time to diagnosis remained unchanged when simply switching from smear-based to Xpert-based diagnosis. POC implementation of Xpert was feasible but required additional resources as well as substantial adaptation of clinic workflow procedures. Nevertheless, a POC program did result in same-day treatment initiation only for 23% of patients. While sensitivity of Xpert was similar to what has been previously reported, our estimate was at the lower end of the spectrum compared to the recently updated meta-analysis.43 This is likely due to the high proportion of samples obtained via sputum induction and lower sensitivity of Xpert in such specimens has been reported previously, although in a low-burden setting.136 The incremental number of cases detected over smear microscopy - not accuracy - is the key parameter to gauge the value of Xpert for TB case finding and was significantly lower than the ~30% one might expect based on global estimates of the proportion of pulmonary tuberculosis cases that are smear-negative95 and the sensitivity of Xpert in smear-negative samples.43 This was likely a result of the good quality fluorescence smears done by the highly experienced technicians in the microbiology department as well as the patient spectrum seen in a tertiary care facility. While Xpert yielded only modest benefits over smear microscopy in our setting, we stress that the population was skewed towards later stage disease and smear-positivity. Larger gains would be expected on average and in settings with more Rifampin-resistance. Also, while same-day smear microscopy is possible in principle, it is rarely implemented because batching results in large time savings\u2014this is not the case for Xpert, which is inherently more amenable to POC use. Four previous studies have reported on POC implementation of Xpert47,48,85,125 but this is the first study designed to tease apart the impact of the 'product' (Xpert) from the impact of the 'process' (POC program) on time to diagnosis. We found that it was the system around the test rather than the test itself that reduced diagnostic delays in our outpatient hospital setting, and that this was mostly due to reductions in post-testing delays. The two principal reasons for delays with routine testing were (i) the Microbiology department received a large number of samples each day from multiple departments within the hospital as well as from the public sector and during the study 81 period had only one 4-module Xpert machine available, limiting throughput; (ii) the doctors came to know the Xpert result only when checking the electronic medical records upon the patients' return for a follow-up visit, which was commonly scheduled three to seven days after the initial presentation. Simply scheduling same-day or next-day patient follow-up, combined with rapid reporting of test results by calling the physician's mobile phone led to the reductions in delay within the POC program and this has now become routine practice in the hospital's pulmonary outpatient clinic. Same-day diagnosis and treatment initiation was not achieved in most patients, similar to the recently published randomized trial125 but in contrast to the other three studies evaluating Xpert POC implementation.47,48,85 The main reasons for this shortcoming was the work hours of doctors and study staff (usually 8 to 16:30 hours), combined with patients presenting late in the day. Treatment would usually only be initiated on the same day if patients lived in the vicinity of the hospital as otherwise they would be referred to their local DOTS center. The strengths of our study include the direct comparison of two implementation strategies of Xpert (routine versus POC), the large prospective cohort for Xpert POC implementation and the focus on clinical impact, in addition to accuracy. In addition, our data adds value to the ongoing discussion around spontaneous versus induced samples.136 Our study also has limitations. Firstly, while some of the general conclusions may hold broadly, the generalizability of the specific results will be limited to similar hospital settings with low rates of loss to follow-up and empiric therapy, as this was not observed in the study population. Secondly, analyses were based on pre/post comparisons, thus confounding could occur if factors influencing time to diagnosis (other than implementation of the POC program) would have changed from the pre to the post period. However, this is very unlikely as the delays in this setting were mostly a result of standard sample processing and clinic operating procedures and these processes did not change for reasons other than the intervention itself; we also investigated the relationship between available covariates and time to diagnosis as well as study period and found no association, making confounding unlikely. Data collection methods differed between the two study phases. However, the outcome measure (time to diagnosis) was obtained from the same data source. Lastly, time to diagnosis and even time to treatment - while downstream of diagnostic accuracy - are still only surrogate outcomes for patient outcomes and public health benefits, which could not be measured in this study. While reductions in 82 delay should lead to reduced loss to follow-up, transmission and improved patient outcomes, we cannot be certain of the magnitude of such benefit. 83 CONCLUSIONS Our study has two key implications beyond those for the study site itself. Firstly, the finding that the changes in the system rather than introduction of a new technology led to reduced delays highlights the potential for process innovation to improve patient outcomes. When introducing novel tests, adaptation of all processes involved from diagnosis to treatment initiation (and possibly beyond) should be carefully considered to reap the full benefits that improved technology may offer. Indeed, the WHO policy on same-day smear diagnosis is driven by the process innovation approach to reduce losses to follow-up, and increase the likelihood of same-day diagnosis and treatment.206-208 Application of mHealth technology may vastly improve the efficiency and feasibility of POC programs.209-211 The second key implication highlighted by this research is that \"the impact of Xpert\" -or any other diagnostic technology- heavily depends on the context: in our setting the high quality of smear microscopy together with the low prevalence of both drug-resistance and paucibacillary disease led to a relatively limited impact of Xpert, while the pre-existing clinic operating procedures allowed for the POC program to lead to significant reductions in diagnostic delay. We note that these results could go in the opposite direction in a different context. Thus, operational research can help inform how to implement new tests and to focus implementation where the impact will likely be the greatest. 212-214 While many studies have estimated the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert, few studies have explored different implementation strategies and this study showed that POC implementation is feasible and provides complementary benefit to the technology itself. There has been little research into the impact of process innovation and given its potential, more research in this area is needed to optimize the impact of existing and new tools. 84 Chapter 5: Accuracy of diagnostic tests for childhood pulmonary tuberculosis: a Bayesian latent class analysis 5.1 Preface As outlined in section 2.2.3, a key methodological challenge in diagnostic test research is lack of a gold standard. This problem is particularly severe in the case of childhood pulmonary TB, where no gold standard exists and the commonly used reference standard (mycobacterial culture) is known to have very poor sensitivity. Moreover, there is no combination of existing tests that would lend itself for use as a composite reference standard with reasonable properties. Due to the difficulty in establishing a TB diagnosis in children, panel diagnosis is similarly problematic and we are not aware of studies attempting to use either of these approaches due to their apparent drawbacks. In contrast, latent class analysis is a suitable methodology for this problem as it inherently embraces the probabilistic nature of childhood TB diagnosis by explicitly acknowledging that the true disease status is unknown. Among other advantages, Bayesian latent class analysis allows placing probabilistic constraints on model parameters where a-priori knowledge is good, as is the case for specificity of microbiological tests. We therefore employed Bayesian latent class analysis to study data from a cohort of children suspected to have pulmonary TB in South Africa. The following manuscript will be submitted to the American Journal of Epidemiology for publication soon. 85 5.2 Manuscript Accuracy of diagnostic tests for childhood pulmonary tuberculosis: a Bayesian latent class analysis Schumacher SG1,2, & Biostatistics, 2McGill International TB Centre, 3Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands 4Division of Medical Microbiology and Institute for Infectious Diseases and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town, National Health Laboratory Service, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa 5Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Cape Town and Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa 86 Abstract Background: The absence of a gold standard diagnostic test for childhood pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) makes definitive diagnosis of childhood TB challenging. This problem also has implications for research studies of test accuracy or disease prevalence. Latent class analysis is a statistical modeling technique that allows simultaneous estimation of test accuracy and disease prevalence in the absence of a gold standard. Methods: We used data from a prospective cohort study of 910 hospitalized children with suspected PTB in South Africa in whom culture, smear microscopy and a NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Test) were done on respiratory specimens and the tuberculin skin test and Chest X-ray had been performed. We first specified the relation between the unobserved PTB status, observed test results and unknown disease prevalence and test accuracy parameters. We also pre-specified predictors of the pre-test probability and covariates modifying test accuracy. The corresponding latent class model was estimated using a Bayesian approach. Conditional dependence between tests was modeled via a random effect, representing unobserved bacillary burden. Results: Median age of participants was 25 months (inter-quartile range 13-59), 22% were HIV infected, 28% were malnourished (MN) and 57% were started on anti-tuberculosis treatment. The chosen model showed excellent fit to the data and negligible residual correlation after accounting for unobserved bacillary burden. We estimated sensitivity of culture, NAAT and microscopy as for all three tests. Chest radiography was estimated to have sensitivity of 62% (95%CrI 54-71) and specificity of 78% We estimated that 44% (95%CrI truly had PTB and 5% (95%CrI 2-13) among the untreated. Conclusions: We successfully applied Bayesian latent class analysis to the case of pulmonary childhood TB. The model fit and correlation between predicted probability of TB and likelihood of receiving anti-TB therapy lend support to construct validity of the latent class and model structure. We estimated that between a quarter and a third of children had PTB, but two-thirds received treatment, suggesting a large degree of over-treatment. Accuracy of culture was low and its use as a 87 reference standard should thus be reconsidered. Better diagnostic tests for childhood PTB are urgently needed. Introduction Childhood tuberculosis (TB) is an important global health problem that has received insufficient attention17. Recognizing the urgency of the problem the World Health Organization recently released a \"Roadmap for childhood tuberculosis: towards zero deaths\"215. A major challenge in childhood pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is the lack of a gold standard diagnostic test18-21 leading to large uncertainties about the true global burden of childhood TB, with recent point estimates ranging from around 0.5 to 1 million new cases per year2,22. Microbiological tests are highly specific and thus regarded as confirmatory tests but lack sensitivity. The tuberculin skin test measures the immune response to TB in vivo and chest radiography can be used to visualize pathology in the lung directly but both can give false-positive and false-negative results18,19. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of PTB therefore relies on a combination of multiple imperfect diagnostic tests, inevitably leading to some degree of under-diagnosis and over-diagnosis17,216. The lack of a reliable reference test also has consequences for diagnostic research. The most commonly used reference test, Mycobacterial culture, has poor and unknown sensitivity in children18,19, and as such is recognized as a sub-optimal reference standard in diagnostic accuracy studies100. Improved diagnostics for childhood PTB are therefore urgently needed. In recognition of this problem the US National Institutes of Health recently convened an expert panel to propose a uniform clinical case definition for childhood PTB21. The proposed case definition is an important step forward as it will make future research more comparable but the classification into five different groups based on clinical criteria that relate to their likelihood of PTB (definite PTB, probable PTB, possible PTB, unlikely PTB, no PTB) still does not allow estimation of prevalence or accuracy. Currently used standard methodology for estimating accuracy therefore either precludes estimation of the parameters of interest (accuracy and prevalence) entirely20 or leads to biased estimates39,217. Latent class analysis has been employed in a wide range of medical and non-medical applications to address this problem63,64. It provides a principled statistical framework to obtain 88 estimates of disease prevalence and diagnostic test accuracy in the absence of a gold standard test and may therefore be a suitable approach for this problem13. In this paper we use a Bayesian latent class model to estimate PTB prevalence and diagnostic test accuracy for PTB in children using data from a prospective cohort study of children with suspected PTB in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods Study cohort Data were obtained from a prospective cohort study of hospitalized children218 with suspected pulmonary TB. Details of the study design and procedures are available from the original publication218. Briefly, study participants were recruited at two hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa between February 2009, and June 2014. Inclusion criteria were age 15 years or younger and suspicion of pulmonary TB based on cough for more than 14 days and at least one additional factor suggestive of TB. Children were excluded if they had already been receiving TB treatment for more than 72 h, if their place of residence precluded follow up, or if informed consent or an induced sputum sample could not be obtained. Written, informed consent for enrolment in the study was obtained from a parent or legal guardian. The Research Ethics Committee of the University of Cape Town approved the original study and ethics approval for the current new analysis of data from the published study was not required as already collected, anonymized data were used. Study procedures Since no single diagnostic test for childhood PTB is a perfect test, five different tests were performed on each child in the original study. The different tests' accuracies are complimentary, some having high sensitivity and others high specificity (a table of reasons for imperfect sensitivity and specificity is provided in Appendix A). Induced sputum samples from consecutive eligible children were tested with three microbiological tests: liquid culture (MGIT 960), as culture, NAAT and Chest radiographs (CXR) were judged as 'consistent with TB or not' by two independent readers, blinded to all other investigations and based on a standardized reporting format. The tuberculin skin test (TST) was administered and read according to standard procedures by measuring transverse induration in 89 response to purified protein derivative (PPD; 2TU, PPD RT23, Staten Serum Institute, Denmark, Copenhagen). Data were also collected on patient characteristics that may modify the pre-test probability of TB or the performance of TB tests employed. HIV testing was done in all children with unknown HIV infection status. Weight was measured and information on date of birth and household contact to a known TB case was obtained from the parent. The \"weight for age Z score\" was calculated as a measure of malnutrition according to World Health Organization Child Growth Standards219. Treatment decisions were at the discretion of treating pediatricians based on all available information. The previously published analysis used a clinical case definition that had been established as part of the study protocol: definite PTB (culture positive), not PTB (negative TB cultures and documented resolution of symptoms and signs at 3 month follow-up visit in children who did not receive treatment), or possible PTB (all other children) and estimated the proportion of definite PTB cases detectable by the NAAT. Statistical analysis Model specification We first specified our beliefs of how predisposing factors relate to TB disease and how TB disease in turn relates to results from TB diagnostic tests (Figure 1). Following recommendations in the literature on evaluation of diagnostic tests in the absence of a gold-standard220-222, this specification was based on in-depth consultation with multiple experts with expertise in the pathophysiology of childhood PTB and the biological mechanisms giving rise to test results (co-authors MN, MP and HZ). As is common in diagnostic research studies, we assumed that there exist essentially two groups of patients: subjects that are truly TB disease positive and subjects that are truly TB disease negative. We therefore assumed a 2-class latent class model. Further, among the group of children with TB disease we assumed that some have a sufficiently high bacillary burden as to be detected by microbiological tests, while others do not. The mechanisms of the three microbiological tests (smear, culture and Xpert) are based on highly similar biological principles, via either directly visualizing TB bacilli (microscopy) or detecting their growth (culture) or amplifying and detecting bacterial DNA (NAAT). Therefore, we expected their outcomes to be conditionally dependent. Specifically, some degree of dependence for cases that are truly TB disease positive was expected 90 due the positive relation between the bacillary burden in the respiratory secretions and the probability of a positive test outcome (i.e., samples with a higher positive burden in secretions are more easily detected by all microbiological tests). As bacillary burden was not observed, we let it be represented by a random effect following a standard normal distribution73,223. A different kind of conditional dependency exists between the skin test and the microbiological tests: the skin test can be false-negative in children that are severely sick with TB, i.e. the sensitivity of the skin test drops at very high bacillary burden. Since this drop may occur only as bacillary burden gets very high rather than at a constant rate, we modeled the relationship between skin test sensitivity and the random effect as a quadratic polynomial. We restricted parameter values for the quadratic term to negative values according to our expectation of the functional form between random effect and skin test sensitivity. Each sensitivity parameter was expressed as a probit function of this random effect. We also allowed covariates (HIV, malnutrition, age and TB exposure history) to influence the latent class model parameters in keeping with our knowledge of their impact as described in the literature (Figure 1 and Table 1). Age was dichotomized at 2 years as a compromise between capturing the important changes in TB risk with changes in age, the diagnostic challenges occurring around this cut-off and managing model complexity18,224. Similarly, presence of malnutrition was defined as a dichotomized version of the \"weight for age Z score\" < -2. Covariates were allowed to alter the sensitivity and specificity parameters through a linear probit model. The latent class prevalence (i.e. TB prevalence) parameter was allowed to vary with covariates through a logistic function. Notice that these covariate effects, besides providing relevant information, explain some of the conditional dependence between the tests further reducing the likelihood of unexplained conditional dependence between them. Prior distributions We used informative prior distributions225 on the specificities of the microbiological tests for TB (microscopy, culture, NAAT), as these specificity estimates are widely acknowledged to be near perfect18,19. We selected prior distribution parameters (Appendix B) that would let the 95% prior credible interval of the specificity of culture and microscopy to range from 99-100% the specificity of Xpert to range from 98-100%. For all remaining parameters we used non-informative prior distributions. For the sensitivity and specificity parameters that were not functions of covariates or random effects we used the cumulative normal with N(0,1). For sensitivity parameters that were 91 functions of covariates and/or random effects, the prior on the intercept parameter was also the cumulative normal with N(0,1), but the priors on the regression coefficients associated with a covariate were zero-centered Laplace priors as described in more detail below. The prior on the regression coefficient associated with the random effect was a standard Normal distribution. Bayesian Lasso We used adaptive shrinkage of coefficients for covariate effects with the Bayesian Lasso226, secondary to the initial screen of covariates based on clinical grounds. This involved fitting a single relatively large model that included parameters for all covariate effects that had been considered to be plausible but pulling each covariate effect towards 0. The shrinkage is adaptive in the sense that the degree of shrinkage is proportional to the variability of the parameter as estimated from the data. Thus, the model allows covariates to exert an effect if the support for such an effect by the data is strong enough. The Bayesian Lasso involves placing zero-centered Laplace (double exponential) priors on covariate effects with a diffuse prior on the scale (shrinkage) parameter226. This procedure has several important advantages227,228: the uncertainty involved in model selection is accounted for in the final credible intervals; it obviates the need for model comparison in respect to inclusion of different sets of covariates; it has the practical advantage of fitting a single model instead of a potentially large number of possible models (each of which could be regarded as a being just a special case of the more general model that includes all covariates but with some of their coefficients set to 0). In contrast to the frequentist version of the Lasso229, the Bayesian Lasso does not shrink coefficients all the way to 0, i.e. it does not perform model selection in the traditional sense of completely dropping variables form the model. To simplify interpretation of results, we report average values for accuracy parameters whenever covariate effects were very small compared to the uncertainty of the estimates themselves (e.g. sensitivity difference of 2 percentage points when the covariate is absent versus present when the credible interval is 20 percentage points wide). 92 Figure 1.

Estimates of all parameters of interest are obtained based on a sample from the posterior distribution. We ran three MCMC chains, each with 50,000 iterations. The first 10,000 iterations of each chain were discarded (burn-in) resulting in an overall posterior sample size of 120,000. Convergence was assessed by visual inspecting of the history plots of the parameters of interest to verify if all three chains reached the same solution and by checking if the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistic approaches 1231. The complete model code is available in the Appendix B. Model fit Goodness-of fit of the latent class model is evaluated by comparison of observed frequencies of test pattern combinations to their expected frequency. Expected frequencies are estimated as the posterior mean of the probability of each test pattern multiplied by the total sample size. As a direct evaluation of conditional dependence, we computed the residual pairwise correlation between tests, as suggested by Qu et al.73. Further, we estimated individuals predicted probability for presence of PTB based on the latent class model and compared this probability to physicians' treatment decisions. Competing models were compared in terms of these different model fit statistics. Sensitivity analyses We conducted a series of sensitivity analyses, exploring alternative modeling choices. Firstly, we fit an alternative model for the conditional dependence structure, allowing the random effect to be a dichotomous variable of unknown probability. Specifically, we fit a model with three latent classes, where we aimed to classify each child into one of three groups: 'not TB' or 'TB disease with TB detectable in respiratory secretions' or 'TB disease with TB not detectable in respiratory secretions'. In this model, dependence among microbiological tests is captured via their shared limitation in detecting TB not detectable in respiratory secretions. A dichotomous random effect would allow for the possibility of a higher magnitude of conditional dependence than is possible when the random effect follows a standard normal distribution232. 94 We also assessed the influence of entering the 'household TB contact' variable as a test, rather than as a predictor of TB, as it is often used like a test result in existing algorithms or scoring systems for childhood PTB37. Lastly, we expanded our original model by allowing for separate coefficients for the influence of the random effect on sensitivities of the microbiological tests. Results Study population Patient characteristics are shown in Table 2. We included 749 children in our analysis for which data for variables of interest were complete. Median age was 22 months (IQR 12-50), 21% were HIV infected, 28% were malnourished, 55% reported a recent TB case in the household and 58% were started on tuberculosis treatment.

Patient characteristics (n=749). Diagnostic test accuracy Accuracy estimates are shown in Table 3. We estimated sensitivity of culture, the NAAT and microscopy exhibited large influence on sensitivities of these tests. The lower limit of the 95% CrIs of posterior specificities were above 98% for all three microbiological tests, being influenced heavily by the informative prior distributions. Chest radiography was estimated to have pooled sensitivity of 62 (95%CrI 54-71) and specificity of 78% (95%CrI 74-83). Sensitivity was lower in children under the age of two years (51%, 95%CrI 40-64) compared to those above the age of two (76%, 95%CrI 64- 95 86). TST sensitivity decreased with increasing from 81% (HIV-negative & not malnourished) to 76% (HIV-negative but malnourished) to 71% (HIV-positive but not malnourished) to 64% (HIV-positive & malnourished). Prevalence of TB PTB prevalence was estimated to be 28% (95%CrI 22-35). To estimate the likely magnitude of over-treatment and under-treatment, we also estimated PTB prevalence separately among the children who received TB treatment (44%, 95%CrI 36-53) and among children who did not receive TB treatment (5%, 95%CrI 2-13).

We show results for two alternative models (M2 and M3) with different conditional dependence structures that match the observed frequencies across patterns less closely. The residual correlation plot shows minimal residual correlation between tests (Figure 2). There was good correlation between model-derived predicted probabilities of PTB and the proportion of children that were treated (Figure 3). The relationship was non-linear with many children with low predicted probabilities of PTB receiving treatment. 96 Figure 2. Residual correlation plot.

Proportion treated versus predicted probability of PTB based on the model parameters. Hollow circles show the predicted probability for each individual child by treatment status with 0 if not treated and 1 if treated for PTB (departure from 0/1 on the y-axis is due to spherical random noise added to the data to avoid many points being on top of each other). The broken line is a LOWESS curve to the data and the solid line shows the prediction for the proportion treated from estimation of a fractional polynomial of the predicted probability of PTB. Sensitivity analyses Estimates of diagnostic test accuracy and PTB prevalence were very similar for the alternative model of dependence structure, alternative use of 'household TB contact' in the model and when using separate coefficients for the influence of the random effect on accuracy parameters. 0.2.4.6.81Proportion treated for PTB 0.2.4.6.81Predicted probability of PTB 98 Discussion To our knowledge this is the first analysis of prospectively collected data to estimate prevalence and accuracy for diagnostic tests for childhood TB while accounting for the lack of a gold standard. Our model fit the data well with the observed frequencies of each test pattern being closely matched by those predicted by the model. Residual correlations between tests was minimal, indicating appropriate accounting for the conditional dependence between tests. The good correlation between predicted probabilities of PTB and treatment decisions lends additional support for model validity. Our results are in agreement with pre-existing notions that sensitivities of confirmatory tests for childhood PTB are alarmingly low18. For example, we found that culture\u2014the most sensitive confirmatory test for childhood PTB and often the preferred reference standard\u2014missed about half of all PTB cases in our cohort. Our results also show a gradual drop in sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test with declining immune function and a strong influence of age on sensitivity of chest radiography. The prevalence estimates suggest a substantial level of over-treatment and at least some degree of under-treatment. Our findings of the limited accuracy of existing tests reiterate previous calls for improved tests for childhood PTB. We provide estimates of the accuracy of these tests, taking into account the uncertainty about the unknown true PTB disease status. We also found that covariates that were deemed important by experts, exhibited notable influence on the estimated accuracy of some of the tests. In particular we show the dependence of tuberculin skin test sensitivity on immunological status of the child. While this finding is not novel17, the magnitude of this has not been estimated while taking into account uncertain PTB status. It is possible to derive predicted probabilities of childhood PTB from our model and these predictions could potentially help improve clinical decision making. The usefulness of this approach could be validated by randomized provision of the predictions. While over- and under-treatment is believed to occur frequently in childhood PTB17,216 the degree has always been uncertain. The estimated degree of over-treatment may seem surprising, but we stress that it is likely to be clinically appropriate, given the dearth of reliable diagnostic tests. Physicians make treatment decisions under great uncertainty in most children, depending on a multitude of factors, with the likelihood of PTB being only one (important) factor among many. Consequences of potential over-treatment must be weighed carefully against consequences of potential under-treatment233. Since side effects of PTB medication are relatively minor in children whilst the immediate risk of mortality from untreated PTB is very high\u2014in particular if malnutrition 99 and/or HIV are also present\u2014a low threshold probability for a decision to treat and thus some over-treatment is indeed warranted. Our study had several important strengths. Analyses were based on a large data set from a prospective study, in which all important tests for the diagnosis for childhood PTB had been carried out in a systematic and consistent way218. The model structure and inclusion of covariates was decided as a result of close collaboration between multiple experts, integrating understanding of PTB disease and pathophysiology and the underlying mechanisms giving rise to test results. We specified a relatively rich model to capture potentially important covariate effects, while avoiding overfitting and estimate inflation by using shrinkage with the Bayesian Lasso. We further supported the robustness of our findings by performing a series of sensitivity analyses to test some important assumptions underlying our model. Although our latent class analysis has been carefully designed, relying on the knowledge of experts, we acknowledge that our results depend on the assumptions we have made220,234,235. We have made these assumptions explicit in this paper and we have presented a variety of sensitivity analyses, it may still be difficult for readers to appreciate the validity of such analyses. Unfortunately, in the absence of a gold standard test (i.e., a test with perfect accuracy) for PTB, making essentially unverifiable assumptions is inevitable to quantify the accuracy of the diagnostic tests for PTB. Nonetheless, we consider this a step forward over making assumptions that are known to be untenable, e.g. assuming culture is a perfect test. The results of our analysis may also not generalizable to outpatients that are suspected of childhood PTB. The data we used is based on data only from hospitalized children with suspected PTB. Consequently, we expect that in out-patient settings, the sensitivity for the microbiological tests are lower than the results we have presented, as children in such settings are on average less sick with, again on average, lower bacillary burden in the respiratory secretions. Similarly, the population distribution of important covariates such as age, HIV and nutritional status will influence average test accuracy as we have indeed shown in the current cohort. Our stratified results may thus help with generalizability and highlight the importance of individual patient characteristics when interpreting test results to make treatment decisions. We dichotomized age and z-score but exploring different modeling strategies will be of value in future work. The consequences of this modeling choice in the context of our latent class model have not been explored to our knowledge but it is plausible that it may have led to some loss in predictive accuracy. Lastly, we carried out a complete case analysis, thus some information was lost because 100 data was missing on nutritional status and tuberculin skin test results for some of the children. We plan to improve on this in future analyses by including an imputation model to recuperate at least part of this avoidable loss of information. Another important next step will be to apply the methods we used to other childhood PTB cohorts, as well as other related conditions, such as HIV-associated adult TB. Further extending the model may yield additional insights. For example, chest radiography was included as a single binary variable, which is common practice and yields useful information as it concurs with clinical decision-making. Exploring the accuracy of individual signs that are observable on a chest radiograph will be an interesting next step. We dichotomized several other variables and exploring more complex parameterizations for them may also lead to improvements and additional insights. We did not include data on signs and symptoms in our analysis, as the hospitalized study population was by definition very sick and symptomatic but exploring these clinical indicators in future analyses in primary care cohorts would be important. We also included only a limited numbers of predictors of TB, and only with the main aim to improve model fit. Their effects on TB were not the parameters of interest in our model but using other designs, one could focus on estimating causal effects, using the latent class model to correct the measurement error in the outcome that would occur if relying on culture only236. This approach may be particularly relevant for studies were TB incidence is the outcome of interest, such as vaccine trials or studies evaluating case-finding or diagnostic interventions. The problem of lack of a gold standard is most severe in childhood PTB but also exists for extrapulmonary adult TB and HIV-associated TB, making development and evaluation of novel diagnostics difficult. It has led to great challenges in the interpretation of recent randomized trials of the impact of new diagnostic tests for TB: an important outcome of such studies is often the \"number of TB cases treated\", but the treatment decision is not necessarily a good proxy for true disease status, since as we discussed above, treatment decisions (like tests) are imperfect. Application of Bayesian latent class analysis to these problems may help better estimate the true effect of novel diagnostics on the number of true TB cases treated. Methods that do not rely on culture as a reference standard will also become particularly important when novel tests for childhood PTB become available that have higher sensitivity than mycobacterial culture itself. Lastly, latent class analysis may also hold promise for the development of better diagnostic prediction models for childhood PTB. While many algorithms and scores have been developed for childhood PTB, the weighting of characteristics that feed into these scores has 101 not based on recognized statistical methods, which has previously been criticized and may be in part responsible for their poor performance37,38. In contrast, within the latent class model the weight of different tests and covariates in defining the individual probability of PTB is determined objectively by how each variable relates to the latent disease status. Conclusions Our results show that with careful model specification, latent class analysis yields useful results for childhood PTB. In the spirit of the epistemology of epidemiology in general, latent class analysis makes use of population-level information and group comparisons to help us learn about characteristics of individuals and individual tests. Use of this modeling technique allowed us to estimate diagnostic test accuracy for, and prevalence of childhood PTB, quantities that could not otherwise have been estimated. Increased use of latent class analysis should facilitate development and evaluation of improved novel tests but also refine our understanding and optimal use of technologies that are currently available. 102 APPENDIX A Test Reasons for imperfect Sensitivity Reasons for imperfect Specificity Culture Low MTB in sputum - Xpert Low MTB - Other resp.

The vast majority of the literature on TB diagnostics is on diagnostic test accuracy compared to a highly accurate reference standard. However, high accuracy does not always translate to improved patient outcomes and such more direct evidence is required before new tests are scaled up on a large scale. Unfortunately guidance on how to produce this kind of evidence is largely absent. In my thesis I therefore explored options for designs, outcomes and analysis when assessing the impact of diagnostics on patient outcomes. There has also been a recognition that simply placing a better tests into an otherwise unchanged environment may not permit reaping the full benefits new technology may be able to offer. In particular, more rapid tests may need to be implemented within a POC testing program to shorten diagnostic delays. To explore this, I compared the relative contributions of novel tests and improved test implementation in an Indian tertiary care hospital. Lastly, a gold standard or even a highly accurate reference standard is unavailable for many diseases, including many forms of TB. This problem is particularly severe for childhood pulmonary TB and I explored the use of Bayesian latent class analysis to estimate test accuracy and disease prevalence to address this problem. In my systematic review in chapter 3 (manuscript 1), I developed a conceptual framework for key patient-important outcomes, outlined which designs and methodologies could be employed to measure the impact of diagnostics on these outcomes and proposed criteria for the assessment of risk of bias for each utilized design. The literature review revealed that the range of settings in while studies had been carried out was relatively narrow: almost half of all studies were done in South Africa, most in urban hospitals and chest radiography was available in nearly three quarters of all studies. Further, I showed that a large range of patient outcome measures have been used in the literature and that they largely show benefit of TB NAATs, in particular that time to diagnosis and treatment initiation were shortened, that more patients were correctly diagnosed and fewer patients were lost to follow-up before initiating anti-TB therapy. While most studies assessing the impact of NAATs on \"final\" patient outcomes (such as mortality) did not find statistically significant improvements, this may have been due to insufficient power rather than the absence of benefit. This shows the difficulty in choosing an outcome measure since the most direct measures of effect (mortality) are also rare, require long follow-up and are usually not available from routine data 108 sources in TB-endemic settings. My review also revealed that confounding, time trends and incomplete outcome data receive insufficient attention, especially in one of the most commonly used designs (pre/post implementation study). The assumptions made in another common design (single-cohort observational study) were left implicit, limiting the value of these studies in learning about the effect of diagnostics on patient outcomes. Hypothetical trials may offer a more rigorous inferential framework if no direct comparison group exists. Lastly, I highlight some options for design and analysis that have so far not been used in this area but may be attractive options for future research. In particular the common pre/post implementation study design could be strengthened by adding concurrent comparison groups that do not experience the intervention. In chapter 4 (manuscript 2), I assess the relative contribution of a novel rapid test versus a point-of-care testing program in shortening time to TB diagnosis in a cohort of TB suspects at an Indian tertiary care hospital. I found that the Xpert test performed well in terms of accuracy when used outside of a routine laboratory and operated by a minimally trained health care worker. However, in the study setting the incremental value of Xpert over smear microscopy was small, due to the patient spectrum seen at the study site and the high-quality microscopy performed. This points to the importance of the specific context when evaluating the impact of new diagnostics. Interestingly, process innovation, i.e. implementing a POC program, led to greater reductions in diagnostic delay than implementing a novel test. This highlights the potential for system changes to improve patient-relevant outcomes and the need for more research on similar interventions. In chapter 5 (manuscript 3), I use a Bayesian latent class model for data from a cohort of childhood TB suspects at a South African hospital to address the lack of a gold standard test for childhood TB. Allowing for covariate effects on pre-test probability and test accuracy parameters, we were able to construct a model that fit the data well and accounted for existing conditional dependence between tests. This allowed us to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of microbiological tests, chest radiography and the tuberculin skin test for childhood pulmonary TB. I showed that culture\u2014a test often employed as a reference standard for childhood TB in other studies\u2014is itself only 58% sensitive and is thus poorly suited to be used as such. I also quantified the important effects of immunosuppression on the sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test and of the child's age on the sensitivity of chest radiography. Being able to estimate disease prevalence in the absence of a gold standard also allowed me to assess levels of over- and under-treatment of childhood TB in the study cohort, once again highlighting the urgent need for better diagnostics. 109 6.2 Strengths and Limitations My systematic review (chapter 3, manuscript 1), is the first review to summarize results of studies assessing outcomes beyond accuracy. Strengths of this study include the extensive search strategy, the breadths of designs and outcomes assessed and the detailed assessment of risk of bias. However, the broad nature of the review limited me to perform a narrative synthesis instead of a meta-analysis and the level of detail with which each individual outcome could be assessed and discussed. While my assessment of risk of bias was based on sound epidemiological principles, it was based on criteria I suggested as part of my review rather than on a validated tool for most designs. My review should provide a strong basis for further development of guidelines, recommendations for the research on the impact of TB diagnostics on patient outcomes. A key strength of my primary research study (chapter 4, manuscript 2) of Xpert is the direct comparison of two implementation strategies\u2014routine versus POC. This highlights both the importance of implementation strategy and context. The relatively large prospective cohort and common use of sputum induction also allowed me to provide additional insights on the accuracy of Xpert in induced sputum specimens. A limitation is the limited generalizability to settings that differ in patient spectrum and operational structure. Additionally, time to diagnosis is only a surrogate for further downstream outcomes that I was not able to assess in this study. The Bayesian latent class analysis (chapter 5, manuscript 3) was based on a model using a large number of tests, key covariates and careful modeling of the conditional dependence structure as a result of close collaboration between multiple experts. The use of the Bayesian Lasso allowed me to specify a rich model to capture key aspects of disease biology and test mechanisms, while avoiding overfitting and estimate inflation. I am not aware of any comparable estimates of the accuracy of childhood TB diagnostics, making the estimates from this study unique. However, the study cohort was based on hospitalized children, limiting generalizability of our estimates. Modeling unobserved disease status also involves making essentially unverifiable assumptions, which is a limitation but inevitable when trying to estimate test accuracy in the absence of a gold standard. We tried to make our assumptions explicit and to assess the effect of making alternative modeling choices in sensitivity analyses to show that our findings are robust. Overall, a key strength of my thesis is that I employ a broad range of methods to address the challenges that arise in the evaluation of TB diagnostics, ranging from a systematic review, to a primary data collection project to the use of complex statistical modeling. 110 6.3 Implications The research I described here will add important evidence on the clinical impact and accuracy of new diagnostic tests for TB. My work should also help improve the quality of future research in this area, which is especially important given the current explosion in development of novel tests for TB and the increased investment in their scale-up. Specifically, the systematic review is the first systematic review of a diagnostic test for TB that goes beyond analyzing the diagnostic accuracy and instead summarizes the effect of a new test on patient-relevant outcomes. Perhaps even more importantly, the systematic assessment of what designs may be used for this purpose and the respective major threats to validity will help improve the quality of future research and hopefully lead to an increase in studies that assess outcomes beyond accuracy. The research at CMC hospital in India was the first study to assess the performance of using Xpert as part of a POC testing strategy and to directly compare this to routine implementation. There may be situations where improving processes is preferable over purchasing new equipment and often synergies between implementing new products and new processes will exist. Research on process innovation to improve TB diagnosis is currently limited and will hopefully become more common such that full benefits from new technology can be reaped. Lastly, the latent class analysis is the first study to give estimates of childhood TB diagnostics. While replication in other cohorts is needed, this approach may allow better estimation of the true burden of childhood TB and facilitate evaluations of novel tests as they become available. It also opens up the exciting possibility to estimate individual disease-probabilities from a diagnostic prediction model that could enhance clinical decision-making, in particular in settings where expert clinicians are not available. 6.4 Directions for Future Research Each of the studies that make up my thesis open up further opportunities for research. Firstly, my systematic review shows the need for more careful consideration of confounding, time trends and missing outcome data and the use of appropriate statistical methods. It also points to designs that have not been used at all, despite being attractive options to address the question about impact on patient outcomes. It is clear that more guidance is needed for the choice of designs, outcomes, analysis and integration of evidence from various studies and my review takes several important first steps in this direction. 111 My study of implementation of Xpert in a POC program points to the gap in research on improved implementation of tests. Most studies assess how a novel test may improve patient outcomes but changes in the system around the test can be equally powerful or provide important complementary benefits. More such implementation research is needed the increasing availability of mHealth technologies and connectivity of diagnostic tools will only increase the potential of similar approaches. Lastly, the study on childhood TB highlights the potential for latent class analysis in situations where there is no gold standard. This modeling strategy should be applied to other childhood TB cohorts and indeed other types of TB where no good reference standard is available. This is becoming more and more important as new diagnostics are developed that may outperform the current reference standard test. Additionally, latent class analysis may be used in studies where increased TB case finding (rather than accuracy) is the outcome of interest. As I point out in my systematic review, many studies try to measure if a novel test can lead to more TB patients being put on appropriate therapy. However, some level of empiric therapy usually occurs making the number of true TB patients an unknown quantity since some treated individuals will not actually have TB. While some degree of overtreatment is clinically appropriate, it leads to mismeasurement of the quantity of interest and latent class analysis could be used as a method to correct this. 6.5 Conclusion I have highlighted some of the key challenges in the assessment of TB diagnostics and proposed a variety of ways to improve upon what are currently standard approaches. A broader range of designs should be considered when designing studies to assess the impact of TB diagnostics on patient outcomes. More attention needs to be paid to the analysis as concerns about confounding and selection bias become relevant in addition to those on measurement that are of greatest concern in accuracy studies. Missing outcome data are almost always ignored in existing studies and imputation methods or at least basic sensitivity analyses should be performed. Research on improved implementation strategies deserves more attention and the importance of contextual differences in determining the impact of new tests needs to be acknowledged and evaluated systematically. Latent class analysis can be used successfully for childhood pulmonary TB and allows for the estimation of diagnostic test accuracy and disease prevalence when there is no gold standard. It should be used more widely and may facilitate evaluations of novel, improved TB diagnostics. 112 Back Matter References 1 Paulson T. A Mortal Foe. NATURE 2013; : 1-2. 2 World Health Organization.
