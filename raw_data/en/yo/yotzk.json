School of Arts & School of Arts & Sciences American Studies Name: Sandy Fried Fogleman Graduating Class: 2001 Major/Minor: American Studies, History, Minor in Communication and Media Studies Email: [cle@wakecountybar.org](mailto:cle@wakecountybar.org) Current Employer & Position: Legal Education Coordinator, Wake County Bar Association How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? I went straight to law school after Tufts, worked for several years as a prosecutor in NYC, then moved to NC and became a stay at home mom. Years later, my dynamic personality and ability to communicate translated perfectly to my position that combines knowledgeable, outgoing friendliness with great organizational skills. Why did you choose Tufts? Everyone at Tufts has their own special spark, combining to become a vibrant, effective community of doers and achievers. I wanted to be able to explore my most challenged, enthusiastic, well-learned \"me,\" and I knew Tufts was the best place to make that happen. How did you land on your decided major/minor? I declared American Studies freshman year second semester because it was everything I loved - history, sociology, my community, my world. I doubled in history because I quickly knew what happens at home happens because of what goes on in the rest of the world. I enjoyed every minute of my studies. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Know your peers, your community, and beyond, and you can make the greatest change in the world - whether it be in a microcosm or globally. Understanding how the media works to influence positive change, and how to communicate effectively makes my job as continuing legal education coordinator both rewarding and influential. I get to facilitate constant learning amongst legal peers, discuss with judges and other attorneys both familiar and unfamiliar fields of law, and generally share my love of being our most effective selves with so many local attorneys. It's perfect! Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Gerald Gill, may his memory be a blessing, taught me so much about history and race and the American South, where I currently live. He and James Glaser broadened my mind and opened me up to understanding other people, in turn helping me become a better member of society. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I worked with Dr. Virginia Drachman on research for a book she was writing on Businesswomen in American History while in my sophomore year. Her focus on American women through history was inspirational and motivational. I knew I needed to be a part of the continued change. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. Summer 1999 I spent living with my best friend and a family in Annecy le Vieux as part of the Tufts in Talloires program. Or, as I like to call it, the most beautiful place on Earth. I cherish those memories so much, I took my husband there on our honeymoon 10 years later. Study abroad. Go to Talloires. It will change your life. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? After over 20 years out of college, I look back with the most amazement at my time on the ExCollege board. I am incredulous that I got to be part of such important decisions, interviewing teaching candidates and deciding courses. The ExCollege is incredible, and I cherish my years on its board. Please provide any additional information you would like to share about your experience at Tufts University to our admitted students. Being a Tufts Alumni means being a part of something so much bigger than yourself, and your value is indispensable. You can find your place, expand your mind, and broaden your potential. What you do from there is up to you. But I know you will go far in this world, and I am proud to be your peer. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Luke Gerard Smith Graduating Class: 2014 Major/Minor: American Studies, Community Health Email: [lukegerardsmith@gmail.com](mailto:lukegerardsmith@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Therapist in private practice How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts helped me most by allowing me to push boundaries in my undergraduate education. Although I knew that I wanted to eventually go to school for social work and become a therapist, I also wanted to explore and study what interested me, and that was anthropology and Ancient Greek. Tufts supported me in pushing the boundaries of my education. It also further ingrained my focus on public service and giving back to the community. Why did you choose Tufts? As a 4th generation Bostonian, Tufts was in my backyard. I remember searching far and wide for the \"perfect\" university for college, all the while I had always dreamed of Tufts, that beautiful school way atop the biggest hill I knew of as a young kid. When I finally got around to touring Tufts, I knew immediately that this was destined to be my home. The campus was beautiful on the late spring day that I had my tour, which certainly did not hurt. But it was the people on campus that we kept running into on the tour--the students--that were enthusiastically introducing themselves and professing their love of all things Tufts. I remember thinking to myself, Either they hired really great actors, or people just really love this school. Turns out, it was the latter of course. The commitment to civic engagement, the nontraditional nature coupled with the quirky traditions of Jumbo, pumpkins, and of course the canon. And who could forget that unparalleled view of the Boston skyline? What I came to love most about Tufts, and the reason I continue to give back every year by volunteering, is the fabric of the student culture: collaboration, kindness, and true inquisition. How did you land on your decided major/minor? I knew I wanted to study anthropology before starting at Tufts, but not for the reasons I ended up loving it. I was always fascinated by Ancient Greece and wanted to learn more about ancient societies and archaeology. Once there, I turned my focus to cultural anthropology, particularly Israel-Palestine conflict studies. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? It instilled a lifelong curiosity and appreciation for how culture and language affect human behavior, and more specifically, how it affects the delivery and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Professor Bishara has a special place in my heart. She was not only an incredibly generous adviser in many ways, she cared for her classes in such a genuine manner. Our projects were entirely collaborations with other students and her in a way that never felt tedious or frustrating, but rather invigorating and special. Professor Mahoney in the classics department is a true Tufts treasure, as she is quite possibly one of the most gifted language professors the world over. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was involved with Active Minds, a student-run mental health club. It was an inspiration for me as a future therapist, and I loved being able to both give back and learn from others. It was comforting knowing how much the other students cared for each other's wellbeing. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Art History Name: Phoebe Cavise Graduating Class: 2018 Major/Minor: Art History Current Employer & Position: Au Pair & Freelance Artist How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I was involved in about a dozen clubs and organizations throughout my four years at Tufts and was constantly pushing my limits by taking no less (and sometimes more) than five classes a semester. I wasn't able to study abroad during the school year, so I participated in the Tufts in Talloires program during the summer. I had never really travelled outside Northeast America growing up, and immediately fell in love with France. When I graduated, I took the leap and decided to move to Paris! Since moving I've been able to visit my old host family a few times and reconnect with the place that first opened me up to travel and nature. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts has one of the strongest communities I've ever been a part of. For a school stuffed to the brim with such creative and intelligent people, it is shockingly not cutthroat, valuing personal achievement over peer competition. It can be intimidating how well-rounded and brilliant Jumbos are, but I would not have graduated accomplishing all that I did had I not been encouraged and inspired by my classmates and friends. How did you choose your major/minor? I chose my major for the skills I could develop. I loved theatre and I loved filmmaking, and I knew I would continue to take classes in both departments regardless of my major. So, I chose Art History to ensure I'd continue taking classes that would strengthen my writing and research skills that I thought might otherwise get sacrificed in a schedule full of art classes. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Erin Pinon Graduating Class: 2013 Major/Minor: Art History Email: [erinpinon@gmail.com](mailto:erinpinon@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Doctoral Candidate, Princeton University, Department of Art and Archeology How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My undergraduate advisor (Christina Maranci) exposed me to and guided me through the material I now work on and love. Today we still work closely together. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts' Centers within the Division of Student Diversity and Inclusion were the most welcoming and inclusive set of campus organizations that I had seen. This was incredibly important to me as I chose where I would study. Also, and perhaps more importantly, my financial aid package was generous. This allowed my family to send me to a top university--a dream of theirs and mine. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Yes. I still work on and publish material I was exposed to as an undergraduate at Tufts. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was very involved in the Latinx Center, and held a position in ALAS. The friends and connections I made in the Latinx Center, or living in La Casa, are still my closest friends from university. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Biochemistry Employer & Position: Senior Clinical Research Scientist, IDEXX Inc. How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts gave me an excellent scientific education and experience with research that contributed to my successful completion of a combined DVM/PhD program and continued research in infectious disease. Tufts also taught me to multi-task and to make room in my life for lots of interests. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts students are passionate about a huge variety of topics, but not in a preachy, annoying way. That kind of community inspires you to develop your passion(s) and to put everything you've got into each challenge you face. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Though I studied something different for graduate school, I find myself back in a biochemistry lab for my postdoc. Grateful that I studied biochemistry at Tufts! Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Mitch McVey was the first professor to force me to think instead of just memorizing biology. Those lessons prompted the kinds of skills I've developed further in graduate school. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I worked in a biomedical engineering lab for a year and at Pfizer for two summers. I wish I'd started earlier! Find research that interests you and ask the professor about their work, think about how you can help, and ask to get involved. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I met my best friend in pep band, made lifelong connections as a tour guide and in JumboCast, played intramural volleyball, tutored local high school kids, and had a couple jobs. I loved the challenge of fitting it all in, and those skills continue to benefit me today. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Laura Quinto Graduating Class: 2018 Major/Minor: Biochemistry, Minor in Education Current Employer & Position: PhD Student in Molecular Biology, Yale University How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts was exactly the environment I needed to develop as a scientist. As I began research, even as an undergraduate, I had incredible support from my research advisor, who gave me an independent project and met with me weekly one-on-one to discuss data and help me learn to design experiments. My professors were also amazing, enthusiastic about the material and excited to share it with us. Classmates were super engaged and collaborative, and genuinely cared about helping each other learn and understand the material. Overall, this could not have been a better place to cultivate my passion for science (as well as liberal arts!!) and gain the experience needed to continue to a PhD. Why did you choose Tufts? THE COMMUNITY!! Everyone is so quirky and passionate about something niche. It's cool to be smart and share your excitement about the history of the MBTA or the role of action movies in shaping societal conceptions of feminism or gamelan composition. But most of all, people at Tufts care deeply about making the world a better place. The energy and compassion of my peers absolutely defined my experience here, and I hope it will for you too! How did you choose your major/minor? My education minor was one of my favorite parts of my academic experience. It started with the classic (very college, but I think especially very Tufts) \"Oh this class looks interesting why don't I check it out?\" Education has permeated the entirety of our lives, and I found I loved thinking about how it affects individuals and society, and ways we can change it to improve lives and institutions. The Ed Department creates space for critical reflection and discussion, and enrichment beyond the classroom (from designing our own schools and curricula in one class, to opportunities to shadow teachers/admins in a variety of schools in others. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I worked in a bioengineering lab at Tufts for 3 years (including one summer). It was a great experience - I got to work independently on my own project, receiving advice and mentorship from graduate students and my PI, but also getting to forge through on my own and learn how to analyze data to inform future experiments, read papers, and think critically about project design. What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? Tufts is awesome you should come!! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Matthew Ryan Graduating Class: 2015 Major/Minor: Biochemistry Current Employer & Position: MD/PhD Student, University of California, San Francisco How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts was the springboard for landing a job at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard after graduation and getting into the combined MD/PhD program at UCSF. In particular, Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts has always been something special. I felt it when I first stepped on campus for a tour as a bright-eyed high schooler, and I am reminded of it every time I meet a fellow alum. Jumbos are a passionate bunch but without pretentiousness. Every day of my four years at Tufts, I was amazed at the big and small ways my classmates were making the world around them a brighter place - whether organizing an all-day Halloween celebration for local kids or protesting the Keystone XL pipeline or, even more recently as featured in the NY Times, establishing a mutual aid fund in Somerville in response to COVID-19. Tufts taught us all about the value of civic engagement, and that feels more necessary now than ever. As Jumbos, we have an instinct to ask ourselves, \"How can I help?\" and - just as importantly - to have fun while doing it. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? The faculty in the departments of biology and chemistry. Simply put, they shepherded me through my four years at Tufts. I had phenomenal teaching from Joshua Kritzer and Susan Koegel and major advising from Sam Thomas - in fact, I hadn't even heard of the MD/PhD track until he recommended it to me! Secondly, the pre-medical advising from Carol Baffi-Duggan. She coached me through some tough decision-making and really helped me hone my voice. We are so lucky to have her leadership! Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? The Kumar Lab: I worked side-by-side with an amazing grad student who taught me firsthand about designing and conducting scientifically rigorous experiments, the pipeline to publication, and perseverance. I'm so grateful for everything I learned and everyone I met at Tufts - it has shaped my life immensely. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Tufts Wilderness Orientation (TWO) formed the bedrock of my social experience at Tufts. I did a pre-orientation backpacking trip in Vermont with fellow incoming first-year students. Three days in, our world was turned upside-down as Hurricane Irene forced us to evacuate. The difficulty of that experienced forged an indelible bond that connected us all four years and beyond - we still get together for annual reunions to this day. TWO was so important to me that I came back as a staff member my junior and senior years to pay it forward to incoming first-year students. There's something really unique about meeting people for the first time in the backcountry. You get to meet people as they present themselves without all of the distractions of technology and daily life. And who knows, you might just meet your best friends while you're out there! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Soshian Employer & Position: Glaucoma Physician/Clinical Instructor, Yale University How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts allowed me ample opportunity to diversify myself and explore a lot of interesting fields. I enjoyed my experience so much that I opted to pursue the Early Decision Program at the Tufts University School of Medicine which set me up to become a successful practicing ophthalmologist. Why did you choose Tufts? After one visit, I deeply connected with the kind, friendly, teamwork oriented students at Tufts. It was the perfect size and fit for me! Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Dr. Clay Bennett was my first research mentor and first life mentor. I did 2 years of organic chemistry research with Dr. Clay Bennett working on carbohydrate synthesis. His friendly, kind demeanor and supportive mentorship not only helped me thrive in his lab, but also set me up to succeed in medical school, residency, and life. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. One of my favorite experiences was the Tufts Relay for Life event. After a year of participating, I ended up joining the committee which led to a memorable (and chilly) night painting the cannon. To this day, I keep in contact with the friends from that committee. & Position: Chemistry PhD Student, UNC Chapel Hill How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? At Tufts I learned a ton in my classes and had ample support. I also had the opportunity to do research which really eased my transition into my journey to become a scientist. Tufts prepared me well for what was ahead. Why did you choose Tufts? The people. For their kindness and their diverse experiences. How did you land on your decided major/minor? I've known since high school I wanted to be a scientist and my first courses here confirmed that. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? I wouldn't be here without the ample support and care of my many STEM professors such as Dr. Kritzer, Dr. Pamuk. Dr. Scheck, and Dr. McVey. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I did research in the Mace Lab and the Scheck lab in my time at Tufts. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. I would not have met some of my best friends if I was not randomly placed on the same floor as them in my first year! What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Track and field team, Tufts biology research group, American chemical society. I was an RA, a chemistry TA, worked at Tufts Telefund, also worked for Tufts Technology Services. Please provide any additional information you would like to share about your experience at Tufts University to our admitted students. As a lower income, first generation student my experience at Tufts has changed my life for the better. I would not be the person I am or where I am without the professors, people, and experiences I had at Tufts. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Current Employer & Position: MD PhD Candidate, Columbia University How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts provided a rigorous but supportive science education that served as an invaluable foundation as I advanced in medical and graduate school. It also allowed me to explore my other interests in depth and expand my horizons by learning from the experiences of my fellow Jumbos. Why did you choose Tufts? One of the tipping points that pushed me towards Tufts came during my campus tour. The admissions officer that was giving the introduction was talking about different projects that students had undertaken at the school. One of the audience members disagreed with something he said, I can't remember what, but what I do remember is the admissions officer replying with \"we disagree, that's a good thing. Here at Tufts we encourage active conversation and discussion so that we can learn from each other\". Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? There were so many Professors that were integral to my experience. One in particular is Professor Bafoni-Licata. She pushed me to complete the Italian major, encouraging me to take extra classes and even giving up some of her time to mentor my independent study so that I would have enough credits. She was a wonderful mentor and teacher and taught me that the interests we have outside of our intended career path deserve our attention and energy, and can be incredibly fulfilling. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was an active member of the Taekwondo team. I had always wanted to learn a martial art, and when chronic physical injury prevented me from continuing to play water polo, I took it as an opportunity to join Tufts TKD. This club quickly became my on campus family. I was challenged but supported, and got to learn a new skill/art form alongside people who became my lifelong best friends. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Biology Name: Elizabeth Bloom Graduating Class: 2021 Major/Minor: Biology Email: [elizabeth.bloom7@yahoo.com](mailto:elizabeth.bloom7@yahoo.com) Current Employer & Position: George Washington University School of Nursing BSN How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? I started Tufts with little idea of my major or my desired career path for post-graduation. My Tufts experience gave me the opportunity to explore a wide variety of interests, ultimately allowing me to find my passion for science and medicine. I learned the immense value of teamwork, to always be curious, and to find the fun in whatever I'm doing. I'm now in my advanced schooling pursuing a career as a pediatric nurse practitioner. I have the incredible professors at Tufts and my inspirational peers to thank for helping me discover my occupational calling and get to where I am today. Why did you choose Tufts? I knew Tufts was the school for me when I opened my first issue of Jumbo to discover four separate features on the wide array of research happening within the Tufts community. From reading about the study of honey bees as a method of understanding and fighting disease to discovering the intricacies of the microbiome through cheese rinds, it was immediately clear to me that Tufts emphasizes and encourages the same curiosity I wished to pursue during my college experience. My \"Why Tufts\" answer since graduating is the amazing people I had the opportunity to meet and learn from for four years! Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? The biology department faculty played a large role in my success as a student, particularly my mentor Dr. Juliet Fuhrman and Dr. Susan Koegel. Dr. Koegel's introductory biology and cell biology courses were the reason I became a biology major. Her passion for science and curiosity for new research were invigorating and inspiring as I was trying to find my own interests. I was lucky enough to have Dr. Fuhrman as my advisor for three years. She helped me navigate the biology department, explore career paths, and go abroad while staying on track with my degree. Both of these women are incredible assets to Tufts. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Kristin Bradley Graduating Class: 2013 Major/Minor: Biology, Spanish Current Employer & Position: Student at Tufts School of Dental Medicine (DMD) and Tufts School of Public Health (MPH) How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My first job out of undergrad came via a Tufts alum who passed along a job opening to the pre-dental e-list. The position was for a dental public health research project and required a knowledge of research, which I had gained through my biology degree, and the ability to speak Spanish fluently, which I had gained through my biology degree. Working at that job allowed me to explore the fields of dentistry and public health first-hand and prepared me for the professional degrees I am working on today. Why did you choose Tufts? I was drawn to Tufts for the same reason many Jumbos are: it has the intimacy of a liberal arts school but the resources of a world-class university; it is minutes from Boston but has the calmness of a suburb; it is rigorous academically but will also challenge you to grow as a person and as a global citizen. After spending three years working for a different institution, I turned back to Tufts for my education as a clinician because I wanted that rigor and personal growth to shape how I care for others as a dentist. How did you choose your major/minor? I knew I was interested in biology and in Spanish during high school, but I waited a few semesters before declaring. I had also been interested in engineering but ended up in the School of Arts and Sciences because of the flexibility allowed in the curriculum there. I was interested in the health sciences, so I took a lot of pre-health requirements in addition to my gen-ed courses and electives, and I remained fascinated by the way biology unveiled the inner processes that give rise to life. I was also able to study abroad in Madrid and realized upon returning that I could easily take a few more Spanish classes and have enough credits for a second major in Spanish. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Biology gave me the understanding of research that allowed me to get my first job after college and allowed me to excel in the basics science portion of the dental school curriculum. Spanish has opened so many doors for me as it has been an asset to be able to communicate with friends, coworkers, clients, and patients in Spanish. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I did a semester of independent research through the bio department (Bio 93 or 94). The department made it very easy to set up and carry out my research, but I was also able to wrap up my project at the end of the semester when I realized I needed room in my schedule in order to study abroad. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? One activity that I did not expect to be involved in but ended up participating in for all 4 years was the Catholic Community at Tufts. I found it was a group of people incredibly thoughtful about faith and the tensions between an ancient faith and a modern world. I met one of my closest friends at mass freshman year, and I am actually texting her right now to have her proofread what I am writing. What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? A part of my time at Tufts that cannot be overlooked is the people there. Throughout my four years as an undergraduate, I met people from all over the world with a range of interests and passions. In the final two years of undergrad, I developed a close-kit cohort of friends, and they have been a great support despite being spread out around the country, or at times the world. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Madeline Carey Graduating Class: 2014 Major/Minor: Biology, Urban Studies Current Employer & Position: WildEarth Guardians, Greater Gila Guardian How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I was able to come out of Tufts with a strong technical background in science and strong legal background in environmental law thanks to my interdisciplinary minor. Both of those have enabled me to be successful in my current role working on a national monument campaign. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts was an academic reach for me and taught me more about what I didn't want out of life than I was expecting. Tufts challenged me in 100 ways I never could've imagined and educated me in every sense of the word. How did you choose your major/minor? I knew I was interested in biology from day 1 and spent a while looking into other things. I eventually settled on it because I know I'd stay interested even when things got hard. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Absolutely. One of the issues I work on is the genetic bottleneck in the wild Mexican wolf population and my mix of biology and planning allow me to critically evaluate federal conservation policy from both a science and law perspective. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Prof. Witten at the UEP. He let me in to an upper level course as a sophomore and got me hooked on planning and law! Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I received an Undergraduate Summer Research grant to for field-based conservation research. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was a varsity cross country and track athlete all 4 years and continue to run competitively today. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Employer & Position: Emergency Medicine Resident Physician How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts challenged me to learn how to use self directed learning with guidance and leadership from faculty to study the natural sciences, and grow comfortable answering difficult test questions. Tufts also exposed me to incredible social sciences which rounded out my education, and made me a more learned person. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts had a great track record for pre med students acceptance into medical school, which gave me comfort in knowing it would give me the resources I wanted to get into medical school. Tufts also values a well rounded education, as I personally wanted to grow academically in more ways than one in my college years. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Anita Gandhi Graduating Class: 1996 Major/Minor: Biology Email: [anitagandhi@yahoo.com](mailto:anitagandhi@yahoo.com) Current Employer & Position: Vice President Translational Medicine, Bristol Myers Squibb How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Going into Tufts, I had an interest in biology and medicine. At Tufts I was able to do laboratory research at Brigham and Women's Hospital and be a genetics TA. These experiences along with a firm foundational education in the sciences lead me to scientific research in academia. For the past 20 years, my research has focused on oncology drug development in pharma and particularly my passion for translational medicine which is the bridge between science and patients which is where I am today. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because of its academic excellence, breadth of courses and the historic Boston ecosystem of students from around the world and academic institutions. The campus is quiet and beautiful. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Ilana Gitlin Graduating Class: 2013 Major/Minor: Biology, Russian Language Literature, Minor in Judaic Studies Current Employer & Position: University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, VMD How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? As a biology major at Tufts I developed a strong background in biology that not only helped me to be a good applicant when applying to Veterinary Schools but has also helped me navigate my first year as a Vet student taking most of the basic sciences again. Additionally, the ability to have two majors and a minor in vastly different fields allowed me to cultivate my interest in the Humanities as well as Natural Sciences and to be exposed to students with varied interests. At Tufts I was able to participate in and lead numerous clubs, thus expanding my leadership abilities, a necessary skill as I look to become a Veterinarian. Why did you choose Tufts? At Tufts you are not locked down into only one area of study, you are free to pursue as many different things as you would like. I had two majors and a minor, but I even know people with 3 majors. The world truly is your oyster on top of that hill in Medford, you have access to amazing Professors who truly take the time to care about you and make sure that you are understanding the material being presented. There is Greek Life should you choose to participate but at the same time you can have fun without being in a Sorority/Fraternity, and the options for club and club sport involvement are almost endless. The friends that you will make at Tufts will last a lifetime and as you leave Boston, you'll find yourself wanting to go back to visit both friends and the school. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Robyn Jong Graduating Class: 2012 Major/Minor: Biology, French Current Employer & Position: PhD Candidate, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, UC Berkeley How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I was privileged to learn fundamentals of molecular biology from professors Mitch McVey and Catherine Freudenreich, which set me up for a first immersion at research in the Freudenreich lab with my amazing postdoc mentor Melissa Koch. Sergei Mirkin's Seminar in Molecular Biology stands out as one of the most important classes I took at Tufts: I fell in love with the elegance of gene expression and cell function and wanted to uncover more stories in biology, spurring me to pursue cancer research at MIT and to do infectious disease and immunology research in graduate school at UC Berkeley. The genuine care for undergraduate teaching is incredible in both my major departments of Biology and French, as well as in other classes (Gospel Choir, Dance...). This environment has enriched my life and fostered my growth as a student and human more than I can put into words. Why did you choose Tufts? There's no other school out there that I can imagine having the same combination of inspiring and rigorous academics, access to extracurricular activities within the school community and Boston area, and an incredible set of quirky, lovable humans who embrace their collective nerdiness! Besides my classes, groups like Tufts Ballroom Dance and Tufts Belly Dance opened my eyes to dance communities that have welcomed me with open arms in Cambridge, Boston, and now in the Bay Area. Reconnecting with two of my best friends from Tufts over video calls in the middle of a pandemic reminded me of how much that community still gives me, years after I have graduated. This is a school with heart and soul. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Abigail Tyrell Graduating Class: 2014 Major/Minor: Biology Current Employer & Position: Stoney Brook University, PhD Candidate/Bigelow Lab Research Intern How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts gave me a really solid and broad educational foundation that prepared me for grad school. Also, many of the people I met at Tufts ended up being really influential for me and helping me even after my graduation (I even published a paper with my undergrad advisor, Jan Pechenik!). Finally, I think Tufts' \"liberal arts\" world view is really important and gave me an advantage over students from more \"focused\" schools, because I got to have a diversity of experiences, such as volunteering and studying abroad, that improved my non-technical skillset! Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts emphasizes and encourages students to pursue a diversity of interests, more so than any other school I have heard of. Tufts' encouragement of study abroad, student research, and volunteering really sets them apart from other universities, and produces students who are truly global citizens. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Yes, I recently got my PhD in Marine Sciences! Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Jan Pechenik was so helpful from the beginning, up to now! I even returned to his lab in 2018 (my fourth year of graduate school) to run some experiments for my dissertation. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I worked at a preschool for one year and one summer through Jumpstart. I'm still in touch with the teachers over Facebook, and I sometimes send a postcard to the classroom when I'm traveling (a tradition started while I was studying abroad in 2012-2013). _____________________________________________________________________________________ Biopsychology Name: Laura Corlin Graduating Community Health Current Employer & Position: Tufts University, Assistant Professor How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I'm a Triple Jumbo and now an Assistant Professor at Tufts. As an undergraduate, I had the opportunity to co-found a global health organization and to get involved with environmental health research. My Tufts family opened doors for me at every step. Close relationships with faculty mentors have turned into close collegial relationships with my fellow faculty. Why did you choose Tufts? When I was in your shoes, I thought all the talk about civic engagement sounded like good glossy brochure talk. But on campus, it's actually what we do every day. I love this focus. I also love how Tufts faculty truly care about their students. We want students to get involved with research, to come to office hours, and to give us the opportunity to help them reach their dreams. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Tanya Davanzo Graduating Class: & Position: Clinical Neuropsychologist, Self-employed How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts prepared me to excel in my career and to be a well-rounded and cultured adult. At Tufts, I had the freedom and support to pursue my individual interests. The university allowed me to do a 2-year independent study with the head of the counseling center in depth psychology, to do an internship in dance therapy at a rehabilitation hospital, and to do independent research. My senior honors thesis was a research project on the neuro electrophysiology of language and memory functioning. I published this work and it provided the basis of my dissertation research when I pursued my PhD. My dance studies provided a window into the world of art, and this has enriched my life beyond measure. Why did you choose Tufts? I applied to Tufts early decision and was admitted. I was drawn to everything from the location to the academic rigor to the liberal perspective. When I first visited Tufts, I felt it was a natural fit. The students, while serious about their studies, seemed at ease and collaborative. The campus is beautiful, and the size, just right. Tufts offered an interdisciplinary major in an area of my keen interest. I felt free to take risks and to try new things in the setting. I would do it all again today if I could! How did you choose your major/minor? I was nine years old when I decided I wanted to study the brain and mind! My grandfather was a neurologist and I am sure this informed my path. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Yes, absolutely! I continued to pursue my studies in neuroscience and am a clinical neuropsychologist today. My dance minor set me up for an understanding of the arts, and I have continued taking painting and dance classes. I am a professional artist on the side. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? My senior thesis advisor, Dr. Philip Holcomb taught me the ways of scientific experimentation. Dr. Jonathan Slavin, head of the counseling center, took me under his wing for an independent study we called \"Freud and Film.\" Dr. Alice Trexler was my major guide in the arts (dance). All three really shaped my world. Their belief in my potential was hugely formative. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Natalie Lowenstein Graduating Class: 2019 Major/Minor: Biopsychology, Minor in Entrepreneurial Leadership, Pre-Med Track Current Employer & Position: Clinical Research Coordinator, Women's Sports Medicine, Department of Orthopedics at Brigham and Women's Hospital How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Attending Tufts allowed me to grow into who I am today. My biopsychology curriculum and professors exposed me to both clinical and animal research opportunities. My experience with the Entrepreneurship department taught me how to make career connections and present myself to future employers. The connections I have made with peers, professors, mentors, and friends have stuck with me after graduation. Why did you choose Tufts? My decision to attend Tufts was a combination of its proximity to Boston, the curriculum it offered, the size of the student body, and the overall feel that I got when I attended a visit. During my time at Tufts I had the opportunity to be a member of a varsity sport, a student run dance group, a member of a sorority, take courses in many different departments, and do research in fields I was interested in. The ability to participate in many different aspects of what Tufts had to offer allowed me to grow as a student, athlete, and person. How did you choose your major/minor? I knew that I wanted to go to medical school and was interested in both biology and psychology. After taking a few of the biopsychology major courses, I decided that this major was definitely for me. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? I think that certain classes that I took prepared me for my role as a clinical research coordinator, however I think that the work ethic I developed while at Tufts has allowed me to be successful in my current position. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Jack Derby was instrumental in my personal growth at Tufts. I was first a student in his Marketing class and then went on to be his classroom operator. He taught me how to take my skills, passions, and goals and present them in a way that would allow me to be desired by future employers. He showed me how to make connections, put myself out there, and improved my public speaking and interview skills. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Pat Oungpasuk Graduating Class: 2013 Major/Minor: Biopsychology, Community Health, Minor in Economics Current Employer & Position: Healthcare Consultant, Moss Adams How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts helped me hone my writing and critical thinking skills, as well as show me the importance of how everything is interconnected. This allowed me to excel not only in grad school but also in every career I've been in. Why did you choose Tufts? All the schools to which I was admitted hosted an event for admitted students that included alumni in the area. Tufts had the happiest alums, and I knew that was where I wanted to be 10+ years down the road: happy, whatever that means to me. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Natalie Perlov Graduating Email: [natalie.perlov@students.jefferson.edu ](mailto:natalie.perlov@students.jefferson.edu) Current Employer & Position: MD Candidate at Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts gave me the education and basic knowledge to get into and succeed in medical school. But more importantly, Tufts helped me develop my sense of self and grow from an 18-year-old kid into a confident, self-assured person. My professors and friends nurtured my curiosities and helped shape the way I think about the world and how I solve problems. Ultimately, it was my classmates and the people around me who made Tufts so special; their energy and the lessons I've learned from them have carried with me to this day. Why did you choose Tufts? Oooof I thought I was done with applications for a while...I ultimately chose Tufts because I saw myself being happy there, cheesy as it sounds. I was fortunate to have some amazing offers from competitive schools, but couldn't shake the feeling that I would continue to be a burnt out version of myself. When I thought about Tufts, I actually felt lighter and happier. I knew I would be challenged academically, but also felt that the student body seemed to be genuinely happy being somewhat different and eclectic. This felt like the pivot I needed to really tap into who I was and grow up. The suburban feel of the campus but proximity to Boston and Cambridge, plus the connections with its medical school and research opportunities, didn't hurt either! How did you choose your major/minor? I knew I wanted to do linguistics from the start of college; I had grown up in a multilingual household and had a much younger sibling, so watching her learn to speak definitely played a role in my curiosities about language development and structure. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Being a medical student with a background in neuroscience definitely doesn't hurt, but I would say I actually use my linguistics degree more in my professional role. While in medical school, I started a lecture series that focuses on cultural, sociolinguistic, and historical aspects of Deafness and American Sign Language. I have been working really hard with otolaryngologists, audiologists, Deaf individuals, and Deaf artists in the Philadelphia area to curate a really interesting spread of lectures and panels to enhance physician care. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? I cannot recommend Professor Romero and his Endocrinology seminar enough. Taking Romero's Endocrinology class taught me to think about complex biological problems like a physician; I loved his teaching style and am so grateful he reignited some of that initial curiosity that motivated me to go to medical school in the first place! Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I took advantage of Tufts' strong relationship to its medical school and conducted epidemiology research through Tufts School of Medicine's Department of Infectious Disease. I ended up getting to present my work as an independent study for credit through the Tufts Biology department and as an elective for my major! Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. I met my college sweetheart (and now fianc\u00e9!) in Harleston Hall. (It was called South when we lived there). Hands down the best and most life-changing residence life experience I've had at Tufts. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Brooke Schuman Graduating Class: 2014 Major/Minor: Biopsychology Current Employer & Position: University of Connecticut School of Medicine - MD Candidate 2020. Matched at NYU for Pediatric Residency beginning June 2020 How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts gave me the science background to help support my process of getting into medical school, and I can't underestimate the immense support from the outstanding Pre-Health advising I was privy to at Tufts. But Tufts also gave me opportunities to explore what I am truly passionate about - global health in resource limited settings - and through these experiences I gained the skills I have now to continue this in my career. Through the Tufts language program and study abroad, I also can be a bilingual physician. All the foundations of my current career and passions are thanks to the opportunities I was given at Tufts. My lifelong best friends are from Tufts, too! Why did you choose Tufts? I originally chose Tufts because I wanted to be a \"global citizen\" and I loved that Tufts promised me the opportunity to become an active citizen in my own community, country and the whole world. I also really wanted to study abroad in college, and I was impressed by the importance of study abroad to the Tufts community: how many students chose to do it, where the programs were, etc. Looking back now, I really feel like Tufts gave me the lens with which I now view the world. I was immersed in the diverse campus culture and learned about people and places I never knew existed. This is the understanding and views I bring to my life and work every day and my experience at Tufts was undoubtedly the most influential of my life. What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? My randomly assigned freshman year roommate became my best friend and we lived together for 6 years! So, the roommate survey REALLY worked for & Position: PhD in Neuroscience and Behavioral Medicine, Rice University How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts was the BEST decision of my life. I got so much research experience in affective neuroscience starting from my second week at Tufts and got to take classes that have inspired my dissertation research (shout out to Dr. Heather Urry and Dr. Mitch McVey!). I just started a full-time job as a researcher at a global AI company and none of it would be possible without the skills and confidence I got from Tufts. Plus...I met some of my best friends for life and the love of my life (now, husband!) in Pearson 104 (the Chemistry building). Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts was perfect for several reasons: it has the academic rigor and research resources of a big R1 university and also the small intimate feel of a small liberal arts school, so the best of both worlds. Everyone at Tufts is so smart and driven. When I visited before making a decision, I was spellbound by the stimulating atmosphere and how much everyone pushed their fellow students to be their best. The people I met sold me on Tufts! Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Dr. Heather Urry and Dr. Mitch McVey. I worked in Dr. Urry's lab for several years and then did my senior honors thesis with her. I took Dr. McVey's gerontology course (i.e., biology of aging) my senior year, which sparked an interest in studying telomeres. They were always so supportive and kind and always made time for their students. Dr. Urry would go out of her way to help me with anything I needed. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Stacy Weng Graduating Class: 2016 Major/Minor: Biopsychology, Economics, Minor in Dance Current Employer & Position: Nielsen Consumer Neuroscience, Associate Manager - Client Service How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My experience at Tufts provided the opportunity to explore a wide range of interests, both academic and extracurricular, that ultimately led me to my current career path in neuromarketing research. I did not know what I wanted to do when I first got to college, but Tufts offered a diverse set of classes and allowed for the flexibility to choose coursework that was most interesting and valuable to me. Between psychology, economics, and dance, I found what I was passionate about, and with guidance and support from my professors and peers, I developed those interests into an interdisciplinary degree that has helped shape my career today. Why did you choose Tufts? When it was time for me to choose my undergraduate school, I had a lot of difficulty deciding. Tufts has a lot of great qualities (strong course offerings and faculty, proximity to Boston, and a plethora of other resources), which all played into my decision. But for me, it ultimately came down to a gut feeling. Being at Tufts felt comfortable - it felt like a community that I wanted to be a part of and a place I wanted to call home. How did you choose your major/minor? I knew that I was interested in both biology and psychology, and the Biopsychology major perfectly fit what I was interested in (more so than Cognitive Brain Sciences, which also includes the philosophical and computer science side of things). Economics came second, and was a bit of a surprise. I decided to take Intro Economics on a whim, thinking that I wouldn't like it, but actually connected well with the quantitative side of it and the connection to human decision making. These two majors didn't seem very connected at first, but they made sense together for me. I also always knew I wanted to continue to dance in college, so it was an easy choice to minor in dance. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? During my junior and senior years, I worked as a research assistant at Tufts' Emotion, Brain, & Behavior Lab with Professor Urry. I loved getting to see research first-hand - both collecting the data, helping to process it, and seeing the meaning behind the results of the work. Having the opportunity to work in the research field really helped shape part of my Tufts experience and provided a good skill set for my first job after college as well. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Chemistry Name: Emily Steliotes Graduating Class: 2015 Major/Minor: Chemistry Current Employer & Position: PhD student in Agricultural and Environmental Chemistry at the University of California, Davis How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My Tufts experience taught me to explore the world, be proactive, question things, and push boundaries. Reaching out to people and building my network were instrumental in terms of me getting accepted into my current PhD program (which was my first choice). I have recently decided that I would like to be an entrepreneur so that I can move my research \"out of the lab and into the world.\" I used to be very shy, so being a business leader is not something I thought I could do before. Studying abroad is one specific experience I had a Tufts that pushed me \"out of my shell.\" It was one of the hardest but most rewarding experiences of my life, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. Why did you choose Tufts? First and foremost, I wanted to be somewhere that had both an international focus and a strong research focus since I knew I wanted to major in the sciences and study abroad. I also wanted to be with other passionate (sometimes quirky) students who had big dreams of making the world a better place. Boston is also a fabulous place to go to school. There are so many opportunities for college students. Lastly, elephants are kind, beautiful animals! Go Jumbos! How did you choose your major/minor? I always loved chemistry and biology. I was going to major in biochemistry, but I learned that I was not a huge fan of genetics or molecular biology. I love understanding chemical structures and mechanisms. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I had a very positive research experience at Tufts. I worked in an organic chemistry lab for almost two years. I formed deep bonds with the undergraduate and graduate students in the lab, and it was a major component of my community while at Tufts. I learned so much about chemistry research, including the good and the bad. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Paul Weiss Graduating Class: 1964 Major/Minor: Chemistry, Biology Email: [pweissmd@verizon.net](mailto:pweissmd@verizon.net) Current Employer & Position: Plastic Surgeon, NYC How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? The biology courses at Tufts provided an excellent base of knowledge: undergraduate education for the next level of learning in medical school. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts specializes in undergraduate education and for me, plans to earn a medical degree made it a great choice. It has a \"suburban \"campus close to Boston providing the best of both worlds. With my home in New York, traveling to and from school was very easy. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Child Study and Human Development Name: Deborah Bamel Graduating Class: 2009 Major/Minor: Child Study and Human Development, Community Health Current Employer & Position: Project Director, The Institute for Healthcare Improvement How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Personally, I met some of my closest, lifelong friends (and also my husband!) while at Tufts. Professionally, studying Community Health at Tufts helped me realize that I wanted to pursue a career in public health, and I went on to get my MPH after graduation. I've now worked in the public health field for almost a decade and I still love the work that I do. Why did you choose Tufts? I loved the sense of community I felt when I visited campus. This probably sounds a bit corny, but everyone just seemed happy. I also really liked the broad range of majors and courses offered - more than your typical liberal arts school, while still maintaining that smaller college feel that I was seeking. How did you land on your decided major/minor? I took Intro to Community Health during my freshman year, and I was hooked. The content felt so practical and applicable and helped me see a clear career path. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Yes, absolutely. I went on to get my MPH and have worked in public health for the last decade. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was active in Tufts Hillel when I was on campus, and it's where I made many of my closest friends and felt the most strongly connected to a community on campus. Building a Jewish community during college was important to me and Hillel offered an amazing opportunity to do that. Being on the student board of Tufts Hillel also allowed me to develop important leadership and interpersonal skills. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Sam Bissonnette Graduating Class: 2013 Major/Minor: Child Study and Human Development, Art History, Minor in Communications Current Employer & Position: Writer, Nickelodeon How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I wouldn't be writing for television without my experience at Tufts. The interdisciplinary classes, incredible professor mentorship, and engaging student community gave me the tools I needed to pursue my dream job. Why did you choose Tufts? The uniquely nuanced courses, the challenging but supportive student life, the size of the school, the proximity to Boston and other universities, and the quirky, earnest feel of the campus. There's no place like Tufts! Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Absolutely - writing for animation is an interdisciplinary career, and I rely on my experiences in the child development, art history, and film departments every day. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Tufts Track and Field! Go 'Bos!! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Lizzy Borges Graduating Class: 2012 Major/Minor: Child Study and Human Development, American Studies Current Employer & Position: Education Librarian at San Francisco State University How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts inspired in me a passion for education and equity. I learned to ask thoughtful questions and dig deeper for answers. I became a teacher for five years because of Tufts. When I left the classroom, it was because I wanted to teach people in a way that was truer to my values, which were shaped by Tufts. I received my second master's degree and now work in higher education. I guess I couldn't stay away! Tufts made me a lifelong learner. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts is full of smart, passionate people with a wide variety of interests. They care about the world and they want to make a difference. Tufts students get out and about--whether it's volunteering in the local community, taking a trip to the Log or studying abroad, they're always out exploring. Plus, the pretty campus just a short T ride away from one of the loveliest cities in America doesn't hurt! How did you choose your major/minor? I took Intro to Child Development with Chip Gidney and absolutely loved it. I ended up taking three classes with him! Then I took an education class with a lot of juniors and seniors who told me about all the great classes they'd taken and their experiences teaching in the community. They were the ones who convinced me that I had to add American Studies as my second major. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Yes! Both of my majors were directly related to my work as a teacher and will absolutely help me as a librarian who works with teachers. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? I am forever grateful to my wonderful advisors, Richard Lerner and Steve Cohen. They are both incredibly intelligent and caring professors. Not only did I learn a lot from them in their classes, they also were my advisors when I wrote my senior thesis. Steve especially coached me tirelessly along every step of the way, and I needed a lot of help! One of the best things about Tufts is that most professors take a genuine and active interest in their students. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I wrote my senior thesis about summer as a cultural institution in American. I discussed the so-called \"summer slide\" and analyzed Breakthrough Collaborative's summer school program. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was in Chi Omega and served on the executive board and the Panhellenic board. I always say that being on the Chi Omega executive board was great practice for being an adult and having a job. We had lots of fun, but it was also a lot of work. I am still close with some of my sorority sisters. We talk on the phone often and one of them was a bridesmaid in my wedding! What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? Make sure to get off campus and explore Boston! Going to the North End for dinner was one of our favorite things to do on the weekend. Mike's Pastry Shop may be larger and more famous, but Modern Pastry (just across the street) fresh fills their cannoli which makes them superior, in my opinion. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Carly Conrad Graduating Class: 2010 Major/Minor: Child Study and Human Development Email: [carly.diclemente@gmail.com](mailto:carly.diclemente@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Second Grade Teacher, New Jersey Public Schools How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? The classes, experiences, and professors that I had at Tufts were instrumental in helping me pursue my career. I am so grateful for the strong academic foundations I got while studying at Tufts, as well as the extra-curricular experiences that truly enriched my life! Tufts prepared me with the tools to be a culturally responsive educator and to work with diverse students and families. Why did you choose Tufts? The Tufts community is uniquely warm, caring, and genuine. This makes Tufts not just an amazing place to learn and challenge yourself academically, but a very supportive environment to grow as a person and connect with others. How did you choose your major/minor? I knew I wanted to be a teacher when I came to Tufts, and studying child development was the perfect way to gain valuable background knowledge while also pursuing more practical course work to prepare me for my career. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Definitely! Many teachers only have the practical background, whereas Tufts' program gave me both the theoretical and practical background I need to be able to think about the whole child (and the whole family) on a daily basis. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Yes! Chip Gidney. I took many classes with him and also had the incredible opportunity to join him and other CD majors on a spring break service trip to New Orleans. That is definitely one of the most memorable and shaping experiences I had as a pre-service teacher. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Greek life (I continued to be an advisor for a local chapter until last year), Tufts Hillel (I became a bat mitzvah at Tufts!), tour guide/admissions intern. Please provide any additional information you would like to share about your experience at Tufts University to our admitted students. Tufts changed my life in every way. It set me on the path for a career I love. I met my spouse and friends for life. And, it still feels like home whenever I return to visit. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Ailish Dougherty Graduating Class: 2019 Major/Minor: Child Study and Human Development, Pre-Med Track Email: [ailishtheresa2@gmail.com](mailto:ailishtheresa2@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Duke University School of Medicine (MD), Class of 2026 How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? My advisor within the Child Development department, Dr. Kerri Modry-Mandell, was instrumental in both helping me discover my passion for healthcare advocacy for children and families, but also in finding opportunities to exercise that passion: from administering ADOS testing as a research assistant at Boston Children's Hospital, to connecting me with Dr. Fleary with the Child Health Equity lab, to securing a job as an educator at a charter school in Nashville post-graduation, to writing me a letter of recommendation that helped me get into medical school! I am so grateful for my field experience and mentorship at Tufts. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because at Tufts, it's cool to be smart (yes, I know that's cliche, but oh well). I was always a quiet, dependable student, but my intellectual interests were never celebrated by my peers. However, at Tufts, my swim teammates came to my alumni award ceremony; my classmates participated in volunteer events I organized to improve literacy levels in local Head Start preschools; my swim coaches even completed surveys I had created for Child Study and Human Development classes! Everyone is supportive of each other's passions, and I wouldn't be as outspoken about my pursuits as I am today if it wasn't for that community. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Swim team! They are my lifelong friends! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Deborah Frank Graduating Class: 2015 Major/Minor: Child Study and Human Development, Minor in Communications and Media Studies Current Employer & Position: WGBH Educational Foundation, Associate Producer on ARTHUR and other projects in the Children's Media department How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? When I got to Tufts, I knew I loved two things: thinking about how to educate children \"outside of the classroom,\" and watching lots and lots of TV. I had no idea I'd be able to marry these two things into a career - until I met Professors Julie Dobrow and Chip Gidney. After taking classes that helped me create an academic niche in \"children's media,\" I did research on the \"Children's Television Project\" and wrote a thesis about gender representation in cartoons. Meanwhile, I also completed a capstone project for my minor in which another student and I co-wrote a pilot script for an original kids' show. Without support and hard work (and references J ) from my professors and fellow students, I wouldn't be producing animated TV at WGBH! In particular, my passion for working in public media and creating educational content for PBS KIDS was heavily influenced by my Tufts experience. Why did you choose Tufts? I still remember the spiel I gave at the end of my tours. I always ended with \"why Tufts\". Firstly, Tufts to me has the perfect balance of cozy community and thriving city life. You can take advantage of Boston/Cambridge/Somerville/Medford etc., or you can nest on campus. Secondly, Tufts is full of \"academically enthusiastic\" students. Whatever your passion is, you can thrive. Faculty and friends will support your endeavors - they want you to succeed - and you have endless resources to foster whatever you want to pursue. Lastly, I want to add a new \"why Tufts\" that I only gained in hindsight: Tufts is Tuftsy. That's the only word for it. It's fun but also focused. It's goofy but knows when to take itself seriously. It's familiar but you'll always meet someone new. How did you choose your major/minor? When I arrived at Tufts, I thought I wanted to study Biopsychology. I didn't know that the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study and Human Development existed. Once I took a CSHD class, I was hooked. The community of students and professors was so welcoming, academically curious, and fun to be around! I had gotten the advice before I came to Tufts to \"pick my major based on who I would be happy working with\" and to this day it is some of the best advice I've ever received. After working in Admissions as the lead Tour Guide Mentor for a couple of months in my senior year, I asked what the \"bottom line\" on acceptance was from my application. Turns out, the admissions officer who read my application wrote \"says Biopsychology. Belongs in Eliot-Pearson\". Looks like he was right. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I participated in sketch comedy in the group Major: Undecided. I was a member of Tufts Dance Collective and choreographed 3 dances with my good friend, Mark Bernardo. I was a tour guide for all 4 years, and became the lead Tour Guide Mentor my senior year, helping to integrate and train new tour guides. Some of my longest-lasting friendships, inside jokes, and memories come from being a part of these extracurriculars. My writing partner from Majors and I still write together. My co-choreographer from TDC and I still try to remember our killer dance moves. And co-tour guides and I still laugh about the most embarrassing things we've done on tours. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: MaryClaire Kiernan Graduating Class: 2017 Major/Minor: Child Study and Human Development Current Employer & Position: University of Michigan School of Dentistry DDS Candidate Class of 2021 How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts University provided me with an educational environment that encouraged exploration, creativity, and innovation. This led to my decision to major in Child Study and Human Development, while also completing the pre-health courses needed for dental school. One of my professional goals is to utilize my background in Child Study and Human Development in order to address and advocate for a diverse patient population as a Pediatric Dentist. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because it offered me the perfect intersection of academic rigor (as well as support), sports (Go Tufts Sailing), diverse community, and professional development. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Dr. Kerri Modry-Mandell was my major advisor, as well as professor when I took Child and Family Health Seminar. She was always encouraging and supportive, especially as I applied to dental school. In addition, she also helped me secure an amazing internship at Tufts Dental as an assistant in the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Sarah Neville Graduating Class: 2014 Major/Minor: Child Study and Human Development, Minor in Chinese Current Employer & Position: Boston College School of Social Work, PhD Student How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I didn't know I wanted to get a PhD when I was at Tufts, but I was able to get involved in Child Development research as early as my freshman year. This put me on track to not only eventually get into a PhD program, but also to get my job after graduation. Why did you choose Tufts? I came from a small town in New Hampshire and I wanted an international experience. I went to Tufts so I could study foreign languages, study abroad, and have friends from all over the world (and country). I got what I was looking for! How did you choose your major/minor? When I looked through Child Development courses, I was excited at the prospect of taking any them. When I looked at Intl Relations courses (my almost-major), I was looking for which ones I dreaded the least. The choice was clear! Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? YES. Child Development (now Child Study & Human Development) is interdisciplinary (so it relates to like, everything) and gives you a solid foundation in social science research (so you learn how to analyze data and interpret research). Both were key in my job and in my grad program. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Absolutely. Ellen Pinderhughes was a mentor for me from freshman year through my masters (at Tufts). She gave me exceptional opportunities to do research, wrote letters of recc, etc. Even though I'm at another school now we've occasionally collaborated since then. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? Yes - first in the Adoption & Development Project (about Chinese adoptees' identities) and then in independent studies. I did Summer Scholars, which was amazing. I didn't realize what a cool study I did until years later. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Sarah Tralins Graduating Class: 2014 Major/Minor: Child Study and Human Development, Leadership Studies Current Employer & Position: Manager for Global Programs, U.S. Trade and Development Agency / Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, MALAS - Graduated December 2016 How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? At Tufts, I was pushed to examine my own experiences and perspectives and widen them. I studied early education policy because I was passionate about empowering marginalized families through policy and advocacy, and over time realized my love for foreign policy, behavioral psychology, and bringing folks together to find and develop solutions - similar, but different to domestic education! Tufts helped me enter public service because I realized my love for working with others and exploring new avenues to solve problems. I was encouraged to intern, work in the local community through Tisch College, and pursue different interests like studying abroad in Brazil and doing research there. Now, I help foreign governments develop high-quality infrastructure, deepen their technical capacity, and work with other experts, including other countries, to help their citizens. I learned the foundations of the skills required to do this work at Tufts, and I'm wholly grateful. Why did you choose Tufts? At Tufts, I was surrounded by students, teachers, and community members who were passionate about what they were learning and teaching and finding the intersection with those interests in the real world to make a positive impact on the individuals we met and communities we would be part of. I believe deeply in active citizenship, community, and collaboration - and found all of that at Tufts, through the Child Development department, at Tisch College as a Tisch Scholar, and other activities like Ears for Peers and Tufts Spirit Club. Why Tufts? Because I learned from my peers and professors that I can explore my interests, make small differences to help the world, and to speak up and stand out in solidarity with others. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? My major and minor - Child Development and Leadership Studies - helped me get to my current position because I learned so much about how to work with others, understand and analyze problems, and develop solutions that are community-oriented and empower others. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Dr. Pott was my guiding light at Tufts, during the tough times and when I had doubts. I am so grateful for her support and knowledge. I also would be remiss not to give a shout out to Tisch College's Mindy Nierenberg, who is such a kind, empowering person who cares deeply about the community and gave so much to each of us. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? At Tufts, my primary activities were being a Tisch Scholar and a member of Kappa Alpha Theta. I loved being part of both organizations because I learned so much from each community - how to think more critically about my place in the world, to broaden my views on different interests and topics, and learn from others. I am still in close contact with my friends from both groups - and it's really special. We've grown in so many ways and continue to support one another. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Evan Wecksell Graduating Class: 2001 Major/Minor: Child Study and Human Development Email: [evan_wecksell@hotmail.com](mailto:evan_wecksell@hotmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Comedian and Private Tutor, Self-employed Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because of its great reputation and northeast location which was close to home. Also, due to my camp counselor experience and three younger sisters I thought the child development major they offered was perfect for me. How did you choose your major/minor? I'm a kid at heart so the opportunity to be around that energy resonated with me. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? The Tufts Track and Cross Country teams. My teammates were my best friends and still are. I was also a member of Theta Chi which helped my career greatly and got me to connect with brothers from all over the country. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Chinese Name: Kelsey Picciuto Graduating Class: 2012 Major/Minor: Chinese Current Employer & Position: Intelligence officer, US Air Force How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I was in the ROTC program while at Tufts, and my major and time studying abroad (a summer in France with Tufts in Talloires and a semester in Shanghai) helped me get selected for the intelligence career field! Why did you choose Tufts? I loved the campus feel with proximity to the city, and really appreciated the focus on foreign languages, international relations, and studying abroad What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Cross country + track, Tufts marathon team, Chi Omega sorority, Air Force ROTC, Let's Get Ready college prep/tutoring - still in touch with teammates and many members of Chi O! What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? Tufts introduced me to people of diverse backgrounds and upbringings with different opinions on politics, global affairs, and current issues. My Tufts friends remain my closest despite all of us moving all around the country (and globe!) since graduation! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Classics Name: Melissa Doyle Graduating Major/Minor: Classics Email: [med672003@comcast.net](mailto:med672003@comcast.net) Current Employer & Position: Director of Integrated Communications for Chief DEI Officer, ServiceNow How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? My Tufts experience prepared me to work hard for what I wanted to accomplish. The university also taught me how to think critically and write with purpose. Before attending Tufts, I had grown up in a very homogeneous environment, and Tufts opened my eyes to other cultures and perspectives. Tufts gave me the confidence in myself that I can reach my career and life goals. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose to attend Tufts for many reasons. First and foremost, I was impressed with its reputation as an academic leader and one that fostered diversity of people, opinions and instruction. In addition, I was familiar with and comfortable at the school because my brother was a student there before me! Not only that, but one of my grandmothers lived down the street in Davis Square. Having grown up near Tufts, it felt like another home to me and yet one that would challenge me and help me grow...and it did just that! How did you land on your decided major/minor? When I started at Tufts, I really had no idea which major I would choose. After one semester of Psychology 101, I chose that as my major. By the time I was a sophomore, I realized that I wasn't really enjoying my more advanced psychology courses, but I WAS enjoying the courses I chose in Classics. Interestingly, I'd originally taken Classics courses purely to fulfill humanities requirements, and ended up falling in love with the subject, so I changed my major to Classics at the end of my sophomore year. I loved that Classics combined history, literature and languages all in one, and really enjoyed learning how the Greek and Roman cultures are the basis for our world today. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? I am a public relations and communications leader in my professional life. My major in Classics hasn't directly contributed to my choosing this path, but the skills I learned in writing and critical thinking definitely play a role in what I do every day at work. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Two professors played a big role in my experience at Tufts...Professor Crane and Professor Hirsch (who was also my advisor). Both of these professors were so passionate about the subjects they taught and so dedicated to their students, that I couldn't help but be inspired by them whenever I had the privilege to have them as my teachers. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. The hallway I lived in during my freshman year in Talbot Hall is one I will never forget. I did more growing up during that time than I ever would have expected. I learned how to live with a complete stranger with whom I quite literally had almost nothing in common...yet we got along very well. I met what turned out to be one of my closest friends on this earth, and I met my first serious boyfriend. It was quite an experience! What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? While I was a psychology major, I did an external internship at a halfway house in Boston to gain experience with the mentally ill. I went to this facility once a week and spent about two hours there socializing with those in attendance. It was incredibly eye opening and challenging. Through this experience, I was able to interact directly with the mentally ill and learn first hand what their struggles were. I gained a lot of insights and knowledge during that experience. Please provide any additional information you would like to share about your experience at Tufts University to our admitted students. During my junior year, I went abroad to northern England to study at Durham University. Other than when I was a freshmen, it was the year I grew the most personally and as a student. Being able to have the freedom to experience another culture for a whole year, while continuing my college studies was a gift I cannot overstate the importance of in my life. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Clinical Psychology Name: Meredith Ginley Graduating Class: 2008 Major/Minor: Clinical Psychology Email: [meredith.ginley@gmail.com](mailto:meredith.ginley@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Assistant Professor and Licensed Clinical Psychologist, East Tennessee State University How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts Helped increase my competitiveness for graduate school. Taught me how to study, time manage, work really hard, and stick it out even when things got challenging. Allowed me to engage in research as an undergrad and obtain a competitive research assistant position upon graduating. Why did you choose Tufts? To be able to participate on Tufts Sailing Team and get a top education. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? I was a clinical psychology major and now am a licensed clinical psychologist and train doctoral students to become clinical psychologists. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? Yes, I worked in Dr. Keith Maddox's social psychology lab. It got me very excited about psychology research. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Diane Vo Graduating Class: 2008 Major/Minor: Clinical Psychology, English Current Employer & Position: Licensed Clinical Psychologist, AMHC How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? I ended up completely changing career paths and applying to only one grad school (where one of my Tufts professors taught at). Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts fostered my love of learning and provided learning at a pace that other area schools were not able to compete with (at least based on my experience with my grade school friends and their equivalent courses). How did you land on your decided major/minor? I fell into it by accident. I fell through a crack and didn't declare a major until my junior year. My advisor and I determined what credits counted towards what and then I had to take a look at what paths I could take to finish all the requirements before graduation. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Instead of becoming a veterinarian, I ended up as a clinical psychologist. I conduct many psychological evaluations so the ability to communicate data to a wide audience through my reports has been an invaluable skill set. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Cognitive and Brain Sciences Name: Ali Marzolf Graduating Class: 2014 Major/Minor: Cognitive and Brain Sciences Email: [alexandrajmarzolf@gmail.com](mailto:alexandrajmarzolf@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Senior Policy Consultant, Aurrera Health Group How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I have really utilized the Alumni network and career resources, both before I applied to graduate school and after. The Tufts connection is so strong! I can usually find one alum who is doing something interesting in their career and willing to talk to me for a few minutes. Why did you choose Tufts? My values aligned with the university and students that I met. I loved the small campus feel next to a big city, and there were a bunch of classes that looked interesting to me. How did you choose your major/minor? I waffled back and forth between several majors, but ultimately settled on CBS because it was interdisciplinary. I didn't have to commit myself to one subject! Learning to code has been one of the most useful skills I learned at Tufts, especially in grad school when I took econometrics for the first time. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Zihan Yu Graduating Class: 2021 Major/Minor: Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Minor in Food Systems Nutrition, Studio Art Current Employer & Position: MS/MPH, Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition and Tufts School of Medicine How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My Tufts experience allowed me to experience many areas of interest; I was able to connect with many amazing professors who led me to discover a field I was interested in. Because of this, I decided to pursue graduate school in order to have a better understanding of the area. With the core requirements and interdisciplinary major I had, I was well equipped with skills that have helped me to do well in graduate school. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because of its location and size. I wanted to find a place where I could create a close community with my peers and also receive support from my professors. A city like Boston also had the calm and historical vibe I was looking for. After spending 4 years here, I realized that Tufts students had so much passion for what they were pursuing and so much love for their community members. I wouldn't have chosen otherwise. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Community Health Name: Julia Fuller Graduating Class: 2017 Major/Minor: Community Health, Psychology Current Employer & Position: Dimagi, Senior Research Associate How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? The Community Health Department provided me with a solid understanding of health systems and awareness of the multitude of factors that play into health outcomes. I also had great professors who had contagious excitement about their research areas. I was also able to volunteer in a research lab in the Psychology Department. That experience combined with some of the research methods classes I took has given me practical skills that I use all the time in my job. The work I'm doing now draws on both my undergraduate majors and I feel really thankful for the position that Tufts helped me achieve. Why did you choose Tufts? I loved that everyone at Tufts geeked out about something. Every person I read about in admissions magazines and websites, met when I visited, or knew who went to Tufts was passionate about something and excited to share it with other people. I was psyched to be a part of a community full of engaged, driven, lifelong learners. I think as a high school student I wrote something about Tufts being \"like a crocheted hat\" because people continued the thread of learning outside the classroom - after going to school here, this is true. Tufts totally lived up to the hype. How did you choose your major/minor? I was interested in health and nutrition and enjoyed the first CH class that I took. At the time, you had to combine community health with another major and psychology seemed interesting. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Yes. I think that I got an interview at Dimagi because I had experience doing research and had a background in community health. Classes like Research Methods in Psychology, Behavioral Statistics, Healthcare in America, and Epidemiology are relevant almost every day at work. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I volunteered in Dr. Shin's lab in the psychology department on a study called (something close to) Emotional Regulation and Neuromodulation of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex via Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was captain of the varsity sailing team at Tufts and a member of the team all four years. I was also on the executive board of ATO of Massachusetts and a member all four years. I also wrote for Spoon University, walked a dog for Animal Aid, and was briefly a member of the Early Music Ensemble. I am still in very close contact with my teammates from sailing. 3 of my 4 roommates are Tufts sailors and I talk to most of my other friends from college sailing almost every day. Both ATO and the sailing team hold alumni networking and social events that are well attended. I'm always happy when current undergrads from either organization reach out to ask about school, jobs/internships, sailing after college, etc. What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? Tufts is awesome and opens a lot of doors. It's a truly great community. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Rachel Klein Graduating Class: 2004 Major/Minor: Community Health, Spanish Email: [rachelileneklein@gmail.com](mailto:rachelileneklein@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Director of Service Learning, Riverdale Country School How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? I value the relationships I formed while at Tufts. The friendships last a lifetime and the work I was able to engage in with my professors was invaluable. After pursuing the community health degree, my advisor at Tufts encouraged me to apply to grad school and revive my MPH. This degree opened doors for me professionally and still serves me in my role today. Why did you choose Tufts? I felt that Tufts offered the best of both worlds: a beautiful college campus with proximity to a big city. Tufts indeed offered just that. It was a place where you could lay out in the Quad with your friends on a sunny do or sled down the hill in the winter, but also you could take a quick T ride into the city of Boston and visit museums, restaurants, Red Sox games, etc. The diversity at Tufts opened my eyes to people from all over the world and allowed me to explore new and different perspectives while in college. I am grateful for my Tufts experience. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Edith Balbach was my community health advisor. She encouraged me to pursue a graduate degree. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Omidyar Active Citizen and Public Service Scholars, Best Buddies, Alpha Phi, and Open Bhangra dance. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Laura Kroart Graduating Class: 2012 Major/Minor: Health, American Studies Email: [laurakroart@gmail.com](mailto:laurakroart@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Doctoral Candidate, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Taking public health courses as an undergrad at Tufts was the foundation for my career in substance use research. I had incredible mentorship and people who believed in me, which I now try to pass along to students I teach as well. I also made lifelong friendships. After graduation, you can find people with ties to Tufts in many communities in your life. Why did you choose Tufts? When you read about and visit Tufts, you can tell it is a special place. The people who might be a good fit there can feel that it is a good match. Then you get to campus and find out that it is true - I met some of the most interesting, intelligent, and creative people at Tufts. How did you land on your decided major/minor? This is your opportunity to explore! Take subjects you think might be interesting, and find faculty you like and take everything they teach. I did this and before I knew it, I had satisfied most of the requirements for two interdisciplinary majors. Finding where you fit is a little like matching a wand to a wizard at Ollivander's - sometimes you find the major, but often the major finds you. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Emily Polinski Graduating Class: 2019 Major/Minor: Community Health, International Relations Current Employer & Position: Analysis Group, Senior Analyst & Incoming Law Student, George Mason University Why did you choose Tufts? Competitive field hockey + academics. I felt like home when I toured campus. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? I was not an economics major but my community health statistics classes got me my current economics consulting job. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Haley Schwartz Graduating Class: 2010 Major/Minor: Community Health, Political Science Email: [schwartz.haley@gmail.com](mailto:schwartz.haley@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Family Nurse Practitioner, East Bay Community Action program & Hope Family Health How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My education at Tufts was the catalyst to where I am today. I loved both of my majors and became more interested in the medical field than I already was. I received my Master of Public Health from Tufts and during this experience, realized how much I appreciated public health and the upstream healthcare way of care, but also wanted to provide hands on care. After graduating, I received my Master of Science in Nursing and became a Family Nurse Practitioner. Working in a community health agency, I use my MPH and community health degrees daily during patient care. Why did you choose Tufts? Oh man-why Tufts? I could go on forever, and normally do with those I interview. The second I walked onto the Tufts campus, the energy was palpable. Everyone was genuinely excited to talk about their experiences on campus and why Tufts mattered to them. That's what stood out, people discussing why Tufts mattered. The course offerings, global focus, campus groups, ability for social activism, chance to create something that mattered to you--it all stood out. I remember looking at my parents after visiting campus and saying, \"I'm not going anywhere else, I want to go to Tufts\". How did you choose your major/minor? My freshman advisor told us to take one class that sounded interested--it didn't matter if it fulfilled a requirement or not, but to take something interested. I took Intro to Community Health and low and behold, it became my major. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Absolutely! I use my community health and public health world every day at work Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I worked with the Community Health department and Edith Balbach on her research. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? One major group I was a part of was the Student Health Organizing Coalition. We were a group of students from Tufts that worked to increase coverage for student health insurance in Massachusetts. We testified at the State House, conducted interviews with local radio and news programs and lobbied for better coverage for students. Many of these people are still friends to this day and we've attended important events in each other's lives. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Cassandra Slater Graduating Class: 2018 Major/Minor: Community Health Current Employer & Position: Davis Hospital and Medical Center, Education Specialist How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My background in community health gave me the foundation to be able to deliver meaningful health promotion content and education to the community I grew up in. The coursework requires a lot of diligence, and employers really enjoy that I have the know-how and discipline to follow up on complex projects. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts was a dream. I grew up in a small town where the education system wasn't very great. To be able to go to a school that was nationally ranked seemed very out of reach for me as a low-income student. When i got into Tufts, it felt like too good of an opportunity to pass up. Although adjusting took quite a while at Tufts, I'm so happy I made the decision to study there. How did you choose your major/minor? I knew I was interested in healthcare and community organizing, but I knew I didn't want to be pre-med. All of the coursework just felt right to me. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Definitely. My work engaging with the community requires a solid foundation in community health and health promotion. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Shalini Tendulkar is an amazing instructor with such a large heart. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Balance Your Life; Ethics Bowl; Russian Culture Club. I'm not super connected to these people today, but I learned some valuable things from them. What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? The first couple of months is going to be a culture shock from some of you. Don't panic. It will all pass, and you will start to get into the rhythm of being a Tufts student. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Erin Yale Graduating Class: 1997 Major/Minor: Community Health, Psychology Email: [erinyale@yahoo.com](mailto:erinyale@yahoo.com) Current Employer & Position: Vice President, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts provided a challenging, yet nurturing environment for me. The community health program shaped my life and career. Additionally, my success at Tufts allowed me to be accepted at a top graduate school. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Computer Science (A&S) Name: Kevin Dunn Graduating Class: 2019 Major/Minor: Computer Science, Child Development Current Employer & Position: Blackstone Valley Prep High School, Math Teacher How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I had the rare combination of a Bachelor's in computer science and the desire to be a teacher. I also found a bunch of different opportunities to work with kids during my time at Tufts. At the Tufts Career Fair, I found a summer camp for kids with special needs. When I studied abroad with Tufts-in-Chile, I had an internship in a high school. With the CEEO, I worked part-time as a student teacher, doing engineering projects with kids in elementary schools. Through the Child Study and Human Development department, I found an internship working as a classroom assistant in an elementary school program for kids with emotional and behavioral challenges. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts is a place where people are trying to find what genuinely interests and motivates them. The atmosphere is one in which people feel comfortable and excited experimenting with classes and organizations purely out of curiosity. This experimentation allows people to keep trying new things until they find something that's unexpectedly the right fit. I came to Tufts as a biomedical engineer, but through experimenting with classes and involvement on and off campus, I ended up doing a double major in child study and human development and computer science, and I took a job as a teacher when I graduated. My trajectory changes drastically, but I attribute the ability to change to the environment at Tufts, and I know I'm happier now than I would have been as an engineer. How did you choose your major/minor? I came into the engineering school as a prospective biomedical engineer. My first semester, I took Music and the Art of Engineering, which had a taste of computer science. In my second semester, I took the introductory courses in both computer science and child study and human development. That semester, I declared my major in computer science because I loved that course. In my sophomore year, I decided to transfer to the College of Arts and Sciences and declare a second major in child study and human development because I decided that I wanted to focus on starting a career in working with kids. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Yes. I teach computer science and math at a high school. The child study and human development gave me a background in theory and practice in working with kids. The computer science gave me the content expertise to get my foot in the door in the field of teaching. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I played in the Tufts Pep Band for a few semesters. It is a small instrumental group, similar to a marching band, that plays at the football games and some basketball games. The group was a great way for me to keep playing the sax and meet new people. I was in Burlesque, a dancing group. Super fun, invigorating, body positive. I was in Gospel Choir - group of over 100 people, no audition necessary, open to people of all faiths, fun, high energy, director is funny and inspiring. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Jiayi (Frank) Ma Graduating Class: 2021 Major/Minor: Biomedical Sciences Email: [ma990801@gmail.com](mailto:ma990801@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Software Engineer, Intersystems How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? I went through a sharp career pivot in the middle of college, switching from pre-med to computer science as I realized that I wanted to tackle healthcare problems from the tech perspective. The encouragement and flexibility of academic exploration at Tufts were what made this possible. By the fall of junior year, I had only taken two CS courses, yet I received amazing support and mentorship to pursue the major and eventually landed a job at the intersection of health and tech. Why did you choose Tufts? In retrospect, I would say how accepting and welcoming Tufts people are. I joined a filmmaking club (TUTV, check us out on YouTube!) as a first-year with little film experience, and some of my best friends and memories at Tufts were made on a TUTV set. The same thing happened when I switched from pre-med to CS and got introduced to the wonderful CS community, or when I decided to take a breakdancing class and found out about Tufts Turbo. If you want to try something new, communities at Tufts will welcome you with open arms. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Economics Name: Tayo Adjapon-Yamoah Graduating Class: 2017 Major/Minor: Economics Employer & Position: Pediatric Nurse Practitioner at NYU Langone Health How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My Tufts experience included classes, activities, and interactions of all kinds--not just related to my major. Through Tufts, I received funding for a refugee resettlement internship that helped me decide what I wanted to do with my life. And, of course, Tufts and specifically the Africana Center gave me the social support I needed in those years. Why did you choose Tufts? When I was applying, I said it was because of the view from the Tisch Library. I maintain this response. I went there many times, for heart-to-hearts, for thinking, for praying. Tufts is a place that allowed me to find myself and my tribe in this world. How did you choose your major/minor? I loved Economics in high school, so it was an easy choice. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? I think that it has. I have a very sharp sense of what is practical, what is realistic, and what is true--which I think comes from studying a discipline that is so rigorous and challenging and based on theory. Most people think that my nurse practitioner role is completely separate from my Economics degree, but it isn't. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Yes! Rebecca Kaiser Gibson. She taught a poetry class that helped me reach deep inside and gave me a space to be dreamy. I kept in touch with her for years after graduation. She is magnificent. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I did not. I love to read the research of others but have never not found a true passion for doing it myself. I am more of a one-on-one implementer. And that's okay! What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? African Student Organization, Hillel Center (I'm not Jewish, but was very involved!), Capen Bible Study, and Jumpstart. I think there were others, but these stand out. I am in touch with friends from these and/or use principles I learned from these every single day. What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? The summer before I came to Tufts, a current told me not to worry, and that I would find my niche. It was true. It took a year or so, but I found a home at Tufts. Welcome and enjoy these four years! Studying is great and all, but if I could go back, I'd study just a little less and spend more time with my dear friends that I'll never live on the same campus with again. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Daniel Bakalarz Graduating Class: 2003 Major/Minor: Economics, International Relations Email: [dan@unisonam.com](mailto:dan@unisonam.com) Current Employer & Position: Partner and CIO, Unison Asset Management How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts provided me with broad and diverse skill sets --acumen as well as interpersonal- and foundations that have been valuable throughout the course of my career. The path to my current role has been anything but straight. Learning how to adapt to change is something that I largely credit to my experience at Tufts. Why did you choose Tufts? For me Tufts embodied an opportunity to learn, grow, and explore many facets of my intellectual curiosity and my personal identity. I had various career inclinations graduating from high school; but no absolute conviction on any particular one. Tufts' environment-its faculty, students, and curriculum- as diverse and robust as it is, promised to awaken and enable the conviction I yearned for. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Lily Blackshaw Graduating Class: 2020 Major/Minor: Economics, Minor Studio Art Email: [lily@blackshaw.us ](mailto:lily@blackshaw.us) Current Employer & Position: Product Associate, Eleanor Health How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Many aspects of my studies and time at Tufts shaped me as a person and contributor in the workplace. Finishing Economics problem sets with peers late at night in Tisch made me a more collaborative, team-oriented person. Running on the track team and leading a F.I.T. (the pre-orientation group) instilled within me the importance of community and culture building. Taking classes spanning various departments made me a more curious thinker and inspired me to solve problems via a more well-rounded and holistic approach. I gained so many qualities and skills throughout my time at Tufts that have propelled me to the place that I am at today! Why did you choose Tufts? The multifaceted and flexible nature of the curriculum: I was able to explore so many topics within and outside of my major and minor, allowing me to view my studies and the world from a more well-rounded point of view. The size of the student body: I got to experience the close-knit community and classroom feel, though I continued to meet new people until the day I left campus. The diversity of experiences, backgrounds, and personalities contributed to not only the quality of my education but also my understanding of the world. The location: I was able to have a small campus feel, though I walked into the hustle and bustle of Davis Square and Boston. I was able to participate in community service in the community, and had access to local (yet globally significant) museums, streets, resources, etc. And most importantly, THE PEOPLE: I was surrounded by a group of truly passionate, collaborative, kind people. How did you choose your major/minor? I knew I was interested in entering the business world and felt as though Economics would provide me with the skills to enter it. I got to take a wide range of classes that gave me insight into business strategy, urban and environmental economics, statistics, etc. I decided on my Studio Art minor because it allowed me to pursue a passion in an academic setting. I learned so much from my professors and grew my skills immensely. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? So many professors at Tufts valued me and my growth as a student and person. They allowed me to be curious, make mistakes, and learn fearlessly! To name a few: Laura Fischman, Chris Manos, Melissa McInerney, Michael Fusillo, Brian Roach, etc. The list goes on and on. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I participated in many activities and organizations at Tufts: I was on the Track team, I was in Alpha Phi, I led a F.I.T. pre-orientation group, I blogged for Tufts Admissions, I called for the Tufts Telefund program, and participated in Big Brother Big Sister. All of these experiences allowed me to be more intertwined in the Tufts and local community. Today, I stay in contact with teammates from my track team and love coming back to meet new members of the team. I continue to contribute to Tufts Admissions by being an alumni interview chair. Please provide any additional information you would like to share about your experience at Tufts University to our admitted students. I have an elephant tattoo.... what more can I say! ROLL 'BOS for life. Beyond the incredible education I had in my classes, what truly made Tufts a special place to spend my years as a 19-22 year old was the learning I did outside of academics, thanks to the incredible community I was so lucky to be a part of. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Gabriel Rondon Ichikawa Graduating Class: 2016 Relations Email: [rondonichikawa@gmail.com](mailto:rondonichikawa@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Senior Analyst, Analyst Group & Incoming MBA Candidate, Harvard Business School How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Being able to foster strong relationships with professors and being able to do economics research since Sophomore year. Why did you choose Tufts? Having such a suburban feeling campus so close to a major city was a big draw for me. Additionally, the size of the school allowed me opportunities that I thought would be harder to come by at a larger institution. How did you choose your major/minor? I came to Tufts for IR since I did Model UN in high school and loved it. I fell in love with Economics while I was here which I got exposure to thanks to the interdisciplinary nature of the International Relations major. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Drusilla Brown of the Economics department saw something in me that I didn't see myself. She pushed me to conduct research, think more analytically, write a thesis, and do things I wouldn't have had the courage to do without a gentle nudge. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was part of the marathon team and the symphony! In opposite ways, both helped push myself physically and creatively, yet both required the same type of dedication and support I was able to get thanks to the strong Tufts community. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Anshul Jain Graduating Class: 1999 [anshuljain@ajgroupindia.com](mailto:anshuljain@ajgroupindia.com) Current Employer & Position: Managing Director, A.J. Group How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? The interdisciplinary education which I received at Tufts has served me immensely in providing me with a basic knowledge of a wide variety of subjects which enables me to make decisions more promptly and with a more holistic view. Additionally, the diverse community life at the campus has helped me understand how to better manage a team of people who would all have their own and often competing points of view, to get a positive outcome for the team & the business unit. Why did you choose Tufts? I assessed Tufts as having an advantage on multiple fronts. It offered a curriculum which allowed me to sample a variety of academic interests in the early years and then beginning the 3rd year I was able to more keenly focus on the majors of my choice. It is located close to the city of Boston allowing the University to offer the benefits of a fabulous campus life and the advantages of being close to a major metropolitan city. Further as a city, Boston offers the expected city benefits, but it is unique in having a large & diverse student population which made it comfortable to adjust into and offered tremendous value to me. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Paulina Jedrezjowski Graduating Class: 2019 Major/Minor: Economics, International Relations, Portuguese Current Employer & Position: Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP; Corporate Paralegal How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts University like many prestigious universities is a living nucleus of some of the brightest students in the country. At Tufts University, by debating societal norms from a number of viewpoints, collaborating with fellow Jumbos, and immersing myself in the study of legal structures in different cultures, I developed an interest in becoming an attorney. During my Junior year, one of the graduating seniors was joining the prestigious firm - Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, & Wharton LLP. He told me about this extraordinary firm that, through inter-departmental collaboration, leverages its status to fight for the rights of underrepresented communities while still servicing some of the biggest corporations in the United States. I researched this firm, applied for an internship, and received an internship offer followed by a full-time employment offer the following March. Today, I am a Corporate Paralegal at Paul, Weiss LLP. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts, an institution in the epicenter of the academic capital of the United States, is focused on immersive collaboration between students, students and Professors, and students and alumni. Tufts Professors are sourced from Ph.D. programs and faculty at the most prestigious universities in the world. Yet, their individual accomplishments do not stop them from their accessibility to students nor their collaboration with students. To call a Tufts faculty member a Professor is almost an insult for they are much more than that. They are mentors who look at each and every one of their students as individuals, young adults who are in the midst of acquiring skills to thrive in future professional careers. Tufts alumni work at some of the most prestigious companies in the world. Yet, they too, like the Professors, seek to mentor Tufts students and prepare them for the future that lays ahead. How did you choose your major/minor? Follow your path, no matter what people say...as my days began to dwindle at Curtis High School, I began to ask my most trusted teachers what I should study. I knew I was interested in the social sciences, but I was unsure of what course of study I should pursue - history, sociology, economics, quantitative economics. When I spoke to my teachers, they urged me not to study history nor sociology because in their view these majors had nothing to offer in the future. So...I walked onto campus thinking I was going to be a quantitative economics major, a social science heavily based in math. Yet, after taking several economics and mathematics courses - I knew the mathematics were simply too difficult. Yet, theoretical economics was something unbelievable to me, the way to explain the world in easily digestible data. Thus, I decided to be an economic major. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Good teachers are the reason why ordinary students do extraordinary things...Tufts halls are filled with some of the best Professors in this country. Yet, there are only some light that spark inside of you. For me this Professor is Cristiane Soares. The enthusiasm that Professor Soares puts into each and every one of her classes is addictive. She plans out her lessons months in advance, incorporates as much contact with the Brazilian community as possible, and connects what we are studying in class to real-world examples. Professor Soares was my thesis mentor. While writing my thesis, the longest and most attention-consuming project I had ever worked on, she made sure that I stayed determined and focused. Moreover, she pushed me to the boundaries of my analytical skills in examining different aspects of the Brazilian community and helped me produce the best possible writing I could have produced at the time. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? Before attending Tufts University, I decided to take a different path. I took a gap year with Global Citizen Year, a program that in 2015 became part of the 1+4 program at Tufts and lived in Brazil. I fell in love with Brazil and upon my return I wanted to immerse myself in the Brazilian community of Greater Boston as fully as I could - studying Portuguese at Tufts, interning in the Brazilian branch of Somerviva at the Somerville City Hall, and analyzing the sociological aspects of Brazilian immigrant life in the Greater Boston area. My Senior year I chose to research Brazilian ethnic classification and political mobilization in Boston - this was to be a compilation of my experiences at Tufts, an empirical study heavily based on my skills as an International Relations and Economics major and my knowledge of Portuguese. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? There are a number of different extracurricular activities that I participated in while at Tufts. I participated in numerous opportunities that the Institute of Global Leadership offers. As a Freshman I enrolled in the Institute's seminar - Education for Public Inquiry and International Citizenship: The Future of Europe. Through this seminar, my classmates and I organized two conferences. One of the conferences was the Education for Public Inquiry and International Citizenship Symposium which was attended by students from Boston and eighty students from all over the world and the other conference was Inquiry: The Future of Europe which was a Model UN-style conference for High School students from the United States. I also was an active member and President of an organization belonging to the Institute of Global Leadership - Tufts International Development: India. As part of this organization, I travelled to work with a non-governmental institution in southern India - Payir. What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? Intellectual conversations and collaboration are part of the Tuft's experience whether in the classroom or in the residence halls. In Education for Public Inquiry and International Citizenship: The Future of Europe, a seminar I enrolled in my Freshman year, I met some of my closest friends at Tufts. After each seminar, the students who had time, would have dinner together. We would all walk to the dining hall and have a warm meal followed by incredible conversations about everything that flooded our wondering minds. On Friday nights, we would gather in one of the classmates' dorm suites and eat pizza, play cards, and de-stress after a usually very intensive week. It felt as if we were a family, we could all depend on each other. This sense of family was something that was extremely important to me and made me feel like Tufts was my new home. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Angelos Metaxa Graduating Class: 1991 Major/Minor: Economics Current Employer & Position: Entrepreneur How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts helped me by forging wonderful connections and life long friendships that gave me the confidence to go out there and build my career. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts for its diverse student body, its beautiful location and expansive liberal arts program. How did you land on your decided major/minor? I took a lot of electives and made my choice from expanding my knowledge and experience. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Yes, I would say it has, although as an undergraduate most majors are \"general\" in a sense, it has helped me steer into the direction of my career. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Ken Okazaki Graduating Class: 2016 Major/Minor: Economics, International Relations Email: [okazaki.kent@gmail.com](mailto:okazaki.kent@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Finance & Strategy - Sales Pricing, Block Inc. How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? There's so much that I gained during my years at Tufts that I know have helped me get to where I am today. But it ultimately boils down to the people that I met and the resources that the university provided to help me get to where I wanted to go, and this is something I'll always be thankful for. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Usjima Pang Graduating Class: 2016 Major/Minor: Economics, International Relations Email: [usjima.vit@gmail.com](mailto:usjima.vit@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Executive Director, Goldman Sachs How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts made me a thinker. In the world of finance, most of my colleagues came from a business school background. I was worried on my first day at work that my liberal arts background won't be enough to allow me to adequately handle my responsibilities. However, one thing that my colleagues often complimented me on is my ability to provide deep analysis with a differentiated approach and to connect the dots between different matters! Why did you choose Tufts? It's the culture. I still recall the first admission event I attended back in Bangkok in 2015 when I had a chance to meet with Tufts admission team. They were the only ones who's really interested in getting to know me! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Dean Sheinert Graduating Current Employer & Position: COO, St. Joseph the Worker How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts' Liberal Arts curricula offered opportunities for exploring courses that were outside of my comfort zone of Economics- Art History, Psychology, Sociology. These experiences helped to empower me to change careers later in life from finance to non-profit. Why did you choose Tufts? The three major drivers were proximity to Boston, beautiful campus, and not too far from home. I realized early on that I made the right decision for the wrong reasons. Great professors, new friends, a liberal arts education. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Yes. The rigor of the Economics curricula framed my thinking for problem solving both in business and non-profit. I was well prepared for business school and the real world. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I spent way too much time in the library. Don't make the same mistake I did! Take advantage of the richness of the Tufts campus and organizations. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Mely Wu Graduating Employer & Position: Assistant Product Manager, MIT Bootcamps How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts was everything I ever wanted from college and more! The network is priceless, not to mention the lifelong friends and connections I've made here. Networking started in college, and I could never thank all the alums all over the world enough for helping me every step of the way, whether they lead to an internship or job. They always said the best way to thank them is to pay it forward to the next generation, which is what I strive to do. Although my current position isn't a direct Tufts connection, my next move surely has involved many Tufts friends! Why did you choose Tufts? Tough question! Tufts is the absolute best, and it continues to prove to be one of the best things that have happened to me! I was so incredibly happy on campus, and every day I looked forward to seeing my friends and meeting new people at the dining halls, classes, dorms, or just walking around on the beautiful campus! I remember having a friend visit from another school, and she couldn't stop going off on how nice people were! She certainly wasn't at her college anymore! Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Dean Glaser's intro to poli sci class was the best! Also, David Gregory was a guest professor for the \"Race to the White House\" class for the 2016 election and he had so much valuable insight and brought in the coolest guests (hosts of the Today show, CTO of Snapchat, etc.). I also love my advisor, who I've seen a few months ago for drinks with some other classmates in my major who are still around the area! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Jennifer Yih Graduating Class: 2011 Major/Minor: Economics, Psychology Current Employer & Position: Tala, Senior Data Scientist How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts provided me strong foundational knowledge in psychology and behavioral science, as well as the opportunity to engage deeply in research. With this enriched undergraduate experience, I was able to go directly to a PhD program in psychology and cognitive neuroscience upon graduation. Almost a decade later, I am still applying what I learned at Tufts to my job as a data scientist in the tech industry. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts stands out as an institution that embraces intellectual diversity and encourages its students to flourish as individuals with deep and diverse passions. In the span of my four years, I was able to engage in graduate-level discussions about emerging areas in economics and psychology; lead a research project that built a collaboration with another university; and run up to 70 miles per week with my teammates on the cross-country team. I will always look back in awe at my time at Tufts. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? I use what I learned in my double major at Tufts nearly every day in my current job. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Heather Urry was my lab mentor who sharpened my skills as a psychological scientist, showing me how to transition from the classroom to the lab and apply best practices of research to actual data collection and analysis. David Garman was my favorite professor in the classroom; what I learned from him about behavioral economics and the economics of higher education have stuck with me to this day. Robert Sternberg was my Psychology advisor who gave me crucial guidance on how to optimally structure my undergraduate experience and prepare my applications to get into graduate school directly after Tufts. Finally, Marcelo Bianconi was my Economics advisor who always showed me kindness and warmth; a minor thing to remember, but special, nonetheless. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I ran cross-country, indoor track, and outdoor track for four seasons each. When I got married last year, three of my former teammates stood by me on my wedding day. I cherish the lifelong friends I made in my four short years at Tufts. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Engineering Psychology / Human Factors Engineering Name: Benjamin Schwartz Graduating Class: 2019 Major/Minor: Engineering Psychology (aka Human Factors Engineering) Email: [benjamin@engineeringforhumans.com](mailto:benjamin@engineeringforhumans.com) Current Employer & Position: Director of Human Engineering, Monterey Technologies How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts was the only school in the country offering an undergraduate degree in human factors engineering (even now there are only about a dozen). It continues to be a fantastic program taught by recognized leaders in the field and sustained through strong cooperation between the psychology and mechanical engineering departments. This foundation has allowed me to build an incredible career doing meaningful and enjoyable work. Why did you choose Tufts? I was introduced to Tufts by family members who had attended and instantly drawn in by the vibrant, diverse community. In hindsight it was one of the best decisions I've made. Everywhere I go I see the outsized impact the Tufts community has on the world and I am proud to be a Jumbo. How did you land on your decided major/minor? I found my major by accident. I really wasn't sure what I wanted to do, so I took as many intro courses as I could to explore all of the options. I was browsing through the course catalog one day and happened on Human Factors. As a bit of a space nerd, I instantly connected the field to the history of human space exploration which had a bit of a rocky start learning to keep humans safe and productive in space. I saw all the opportunities to apply these skills to the world around us and declared a major without hesitation. Plus, as a multi-disciplinary field, all of those intro courses in different departments proved rather valuable. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? At Tufts I majored in human factors engineering and I continue to work in the field. I also earned a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School in the related field of human systems integration. Between my academic and career experience, I have become a leader in the field contributing to several standards, presenting at industry conferences, and writing a blog that \"explores the role of people in complex sociotechnical systems and effective systems engineering approaches for incorporating them.\" My current role is director of human engineering at Monterey Technologies where I support a top-notch team working on interesting and complex problems. _____________________________________________________________________________________ English Name: Sharon Bernstein Graduating Class: 1996 Major/Minor: English Email: [sharon.a.bernstein@gmail.com](mailto:sharon.a.bernstein@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Vice President of Marketing, Engageli How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I started out my Tufts career as a civil engineering major, and transitioned to English. The blend of math and writing was the perfect foundation for my career in marketing analytics. I've worked with the largest brands in the world, and I don't think I could have done it without my Tufts education. Why did you choose Tufts? I grew up in New York, so I knew I wanted to go to school in Boston as it was close enough, but far enough away from home. I also wanted a well-rounded, liberal arts education. I visited campus and it felt like home. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Victoria Lonardo Graduating Class: 2021 Major/Minor: English, Education, Minor in Child Study and Human Development Current Employer & Position: Masters of Art in Teaching Candidate, Brown University How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts' world-class education thoroughly prepared me for the rigorous, accelerated graduate program I am in today. Tufts also introduced me to numerous opportunities that helped me prepare for my career as an urban educator during my undergraduate years, and some of the professors I had during my time at Tufts truly shaped my teaching identity. I cannot imagine where I would be today if I hadn't attended Tufts. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because it has everything I was looking for from a liberal arts college: a diverse and quirky student body, amazing educators from a wide variety of backgrounds, and plentiful connections and opportunities to set me up for success! Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? I had an inkling that I wanted to be a teacher when I started out at Tufts, but the Education department at Tufts made me absolutely confident of my decision to pursue this career path. I am so grateful for all of the support they gave me throughout my four years at Tufts, both as a rising educator and as a person. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Lee Edelman and Joseph Litvak showed me what it really means to analyze literature. I thought I was a good writer when I arrived at Tufts, but they pushed my thinking to the next level every single semester. Linda Beardsley is one of the most lovely and intelligent women I have ever had the pleasure of knowing, and I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to learn from her. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I will always treasure my memories as a former member of Major: Undecided Sketch Comedy! I recently visited Tufts to attend one of their shows, and they are still as funny as ever! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Marina Shtyrkov Graduating Class: 2015 Major/Minor: English, Minor in Mass Communications and Media Studies, Entrepreneurial Leadership Current Employer & Position: Senior Analyst at Cerulli Associates How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Nearly five years later, I'm still working for the same firm that I joined as an entry-level analyst after graduating from Tufts as an English major. Tufts gave me the freedom and flexibility to find a career path--not just a first job--and it prepared me for a role that wasn't linearly connected to my degree. I learned how to communicate effectively, think critically, and analyze patterns. All of these are skills that continue to benefit me today. Why did you choose Tufts? Without Tufts, I would have never taught high school students a comprehensive health curriculum through Peer Health Exchange or designed an Ex-College course on women in the workplace. At Tufts, I found unique opportunities to grow, learn, and thrive. The energy on campus is palpable and infectious. Yet, remarkably, everyone you meet remains humble, collaborative, and kind. Tufts is a breeding ground for intellectually curious, engaged, and motivated students that are eager to make an impact on their communities. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Ronna Johnson! I took several of her courses in the English department (which were great!), but more importantly, it was always clear that she cared deeply about her students as individuals. If college life ever became overwhelming, she was supportive and compassionate. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? For all four years, I volunteered with Peer Health Exchange--first, as a health educator, then a member of the Leadership Council, and finally, co-coordinator of the Tufts chapter. Not only did I meet some close friends through the program, but it was an incredible opportunity to have a direct impact on surrounding communities in the Greater Boston area. The experience also taught me valuable public speaking and leadership skills. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Julie Suratt Graduating Class: 1994 Major/Minor: English Email: [juliesuratt@outlook.com](mailto:juliesuratt@outlook.com) Current Employer & Position: Editor, Boston Magazine How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? It was a combination of factors: Tufts' proximity to Boston allowed me to apply for communications internships during both my junior and senior year, which gave me much-needed exposure to different industries and experience for my resume. Also, writing occasionally for the Tufts Daily newspaper gave me published \"clips\" which I could submit to the magazines and newspapers I was applying to. Lastly, I took a phenomenal creative writing class that really honed my writing skills. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Kristin Tomecek Graduating Class: 2018 Major/Minor: English, Film, Music Current Employer & Position: No Trace Camping, Assistant Producer How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? From professors who fostered a culture of unending curiosity and intellectual rigor to my peers that made up a supportive network I still use today, Tufts equipped me with the resources to succeed \"over the Hill!\" Why did you choose Tufts? Pax et lux - bright young minds shedding light on all areas of study in pursuit of peace for one and all. It's cheesy, but it's true! Nowhere else will you find a community of people so quirky, hungry, and just plain smart who are ready to lift you up to your highest potential. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Professor Sonia Hofkosh fostered my love of the novel and the female perspective, always guiding me to pursue my passions and not let myself get in my own way. Professor Lee Edelman made me see film in a whole new way, raising the bar in a way that challenged all my peers step up and provide the most intellectually rewarding experience ever. Professor Khary Jones encouraged me to keep writing and allowed me to see the potential of a career in entertainment. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Tufts University Television provided me with the exposure, skills, and network to pursue a career in film. I'm still pals with the people I worked with at TUTV, and it's especially fun to see fellow Jumbos here in LA! _____________________________________________________________________________________ French Name: Carolyn Margulies Graduating Class: Sociology Email: [marguilesc@gmail.com](mailto:marguilesc@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Investigator, The Bronx Defenders, incoming student for a Masters in Social Work at UMichigan How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? I found that Tufts allowed me to take such a wide range of classes that I was able to nurture my intellectual curiosity in every academic field. For example, the ExCollege class I took on fatness in America expanded my knowledge of how I experience the world around me in a radical way that transcended any single academic discipline. I got to where I am today (working in public defense) because my professors and peers were so willing to ask \"why\" and help support me as I tried to find those answers. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because it was the only school I toured where the students seemed like they actually wanted to be there and seemed happy. Also, frankly, my tour guide mentioned on the walk from the arts buildings towards the Campus Center that the Tufts quidditch team was called \"The Tufflepuffs.\" I thought that pun was so terrible that I immediately knew I wanted to attend the school. How did you land on your decided major/minor? I was not a particularly mature 18 year old and, when searching through the course catalogue going into freshman fall, I saw a class called \"Sex and Gender in Society.\" I mumbled \"huh huh sex\" to myself and decided to take the course. When I started taking Sociology classes, I felt as though my brain was functioning at 100% for the first time, and everything in the world suddenly made sense. For my French major, I took a course with Claire Schub and decided that I would do whatever it takes to have her as my professor again and again. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? I would say my French and Sociology double major have definitely played a key factor in my current position today ! I work as an Investigator for a Public Defenders' Office, and I absolutely would not be able to do this work without having had the opportunity to learn not only about the way law and politics interact with society but also about the ways that factors such as poverty, race, transphobia, and power establish and maintain the criminal punishment system in the way it currently exists. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Claire Schub is the reason I became and stayed a French major because of her kindness, warmth, and deep dedication to the Romance Language department. Helen Marrow pushed me to become a better student and researcher. Freeden Blume-Oeur was inspirational and exceptional in every way. Mary Glaser was so kind. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I took two research methods classes as a part of my Sociology major and wrote a senior thesis in the departments of Sociology and French. My research methods classes allowed me to look into how students felt about the way Tufts reported events such as bomb threats, stabbings, and on-campus break-ins and how non-binary Americans who study French navigate their gender in the language. My thesis explored how non-binary Francophone people develop and understand their gender. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. On the first day of orientation, my building had a large rock-paper-scissors tournament where, if you lost, you had to cheer for whoever won (and you kept following the winner until there was only one). The field narrowed quickly where it became one winner from Tilton (followed by all the students who lived in Tilton) going against the winner from Haskell. I don't remember who won (though, as a former member of T3, I will say I like to think it was Tilton), but I remember it being loud and fun and a wonderful way to start my Tufts career. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was an editor and graphic designer for the Tufts Zamboni, a dancer, choreographer, and president of the Tufts Dance Collective, and the president of the Tufts Futurism Society. I stay in contact with Zamboni through our still-active snapchat and group message and by visiting every year to teach the underclassmen how to use Photoshop and InDesign. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Constance Pierce Graduating Class: 1966 Major/Minor: French, Education Current Employer & Position: Retired How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? I had the opportunity to practice teaching so that when I was hired to teach junior high school French upon graduation, I had a small amount of experience. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Becoming a French teacher allowed me to work with young people, travel, work full time while raising a family and even hold French conversation classes with seniors in retirement. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. I lived in the French house my final two years. I was on the third floor and could be independent while also a part of a small community of students with similar interests. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I played varsity field hockey, and varsity tennis. I sang in the glee club and was a member of the Jackson Jills. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Phyllis Whitten Graduating Class: 1969 Major/Minor: Employer & Position: Retired; French Teacher, Shrewsbury Montessori School How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts provided student teaching experiences that helped me with job opportunities. Two of my daughters got their first jobs because of Tufts connections. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts for its location near Boston, yet a wonderful campus, its international flavor and community engagement. How did you land on your decided major/minor? I wanted to continue my education in French language and culture. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I enjoyed chorus at Tufts...and met my husband! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Sara Africana Studies Email: [byala@upenn.edu](mailto:byala@upenn.edu) Current Employer & Position: Senior Lecturer, Critical Writing and History, University of Pennsylvania How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Though born in South Africa, it was at Tufts that I was introduced to the study of African history, setting me on my life's path. I had many mentors at Tufts, and I credit them all with inspiring me to enter academia, as well as serving as high benchmarks for the kind of teacher, mentor, and scholar I aspire to be. Why did you choose Tufts? Even way back in the 1990s, I knew that Tufts offered something no other school I looked at did: a unique blend of small liberal arts college and world renowned university. This opened up space for interdisciplinary and creative inquiry. Also: I love elephants. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? From the first day I stepped into her \"Race, Class, and Power in South Africa\" class to today, Jeanne Penvenne has been a mentor and, now, a friend. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: RW Fisher Graduating Class: 1971 [wistar69@hotmail.com](mailto:wistar69@hotmail.com) Current Employer & Position: CBC TV News (retired) Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts' liberal arts tradition allowed maximum intellectual freedom to choose courses and satisfy my curiosity. How did you choose your major/minor? History seemed the best fit after trying Psychology initially. English was a bit of an accident. I had taken several poetry courses and creative writing. Drama credits from my Tufts in London junior year gave me the points I needed to qualify as an English major. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Joyce Minkoff Graduating Class: 1987 Major/Minor: History, American Studies Email: [jminkoff@msn.com](mailto:jminkoff@msn.com) Current Employer & Position: Development Associate, Foundation For MetroWest How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? When I was studying at Tufts, my American Studies professors always stressed that just because you are interested in something as an undergraduate, you don't have to do or be that for the rest of your life. They encouraged their students to take different journeys in life, explore different paths and continue to evolve. This has always resonated for me. I have done this several times in my life/career and now I am working for a fabulous non-profit community foundation in my area. Why did you choose Tufts? I fell in love with Tufts when I visited the campus during my senior year. I could see myself there and saw myself in the students I saw during my visit. I had heard that Tufts didn't really have a campus and I couldn't believe there was definitely a campus and a great one. I loved the course offerings and wanted the opportunity to try so many of them. I wanted to be a Jumbo!!! How did you choose your major/minor? I could not figure out what I wanted as a major. I liked history, I liked psych and political science. Someone told me I could combine different areas of study with a major in American Studies. It was something that really interested me and I really liked the multidisciplinary approach. I was sold! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Marc Pannier 1993 Major/Minor: in Economics Email: [marc.pannier@marshmma.com](mailto:marc.pannier@marshmma.com) Current Employer & Position: Principal, Marsh & McLennan Agency How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? The ability to write in a concise, efficient manner is necessary in business along with understanding how to help business owners and I learned how to do both during my time at Tufts. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts as something completely different than the bubble of Southern California. I wanted to experience a great city like Boston with its history, be surrounded by thousands of other college students from different cultures, and open my mind to other ways of thinking. I would make the same decision again. How did you choose your major/minor? Organic chemistry killed the dream of being a doctor, so Pre-Med ended and I had always loved history and geography. I concentrated on the Middle East since I wanted to better understand the cultural differences. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was a tennis player and one of best friendships still today was with a fellow tennis player from Missouri who now lives close to me in SoCal. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Conrad Pastore Graduating Class: Employer & Position: Barst Mukamal & Kleiner - Immigration Law Case Manager How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts helped me hone my critical thinking skills, trained me to take in and consider alternative viewpoints to my own when considering a question or problem, and helped me on my writing (important when you practice law!). In addition, the firm I currently work at has a history of hiring Tufts graduates, which was a huge plus for me when applying. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts provides a great combination of intelligent teachers who push you to do well (Jeffrey Taliaferro), a bevy of resources for research and information purposes, and good sledding hills. I had never visited Tufts or Boston before I moved in - whatever my thoughts about Boston, Tufts was 100% worth it. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Phoebe Sargeant Graduating Class: 2021 History, Minor in Roman Civilization and Education Email: [phoebe.a.sargeant@gmail.com](mailto:phoebe.a.sargeant@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: MAT in Secondary History Education, Tufts University How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts allowed me the opportunity to pursue whatever interests me the most. If I had attended a school that did not have a flexible program, I would not have been able to pursue my passion for education that I only developed later in my academic career. Also the professors were nothing but supportive and broadened my understanding of opportunities that were available to me post-graduation. Why did you choose Tufts? There are so many reasons... The main one I would say is that Tufts encourages students to not only have an extensive and broad academic background, but the programs ask that students pursue many different avenues of study as well as merge academic fields that might seem different in the on-set. In addition, Tufts offers many research opportunities to undergrads, as I was able to complete my own research guided by my personal interests within the intersection of history and education. How did you land on your decided major/minor? I always had a passion for history, but it was not until I stumbled into education classes that I truly discovered where to apply this historical knowledge. It was this intersection of history and education that encouraged me to continue with my history classes as well as develop critical historical thought and analysis. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? There are three, Professor Proctor and Professor Drachman in the history department and Professor Cohen in the Education department. Each played a unique and critical role in the development of my passion for history and career decisions. All three, like most professors at Tufts, care deeply about students and push us to achieve high academic success as well as challenge us to become critical thinkers and refined scholars. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I was a part of the Laidlaw program that began in 2018. I studied the historical narrative that was presented to American high schoolers through textbooks published from 1975 to 2000 with a specific focus on the American Revolution. The Laidlaw program was fantastic as it fostered a community of other young researchers and taught us valuable leadership skills all while providing us with the opportunity to pursue a research question at a very young age. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Harrison Shapiro Graduating Class: 2017 Major/Minor: History, Minor in Finance, Economics Email: [harrisonjshapiro@gmail.com](mailto:harrisonjshapiro@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: MBA Candidate, Columbia Business School How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts made me a holistic thinker in a way that pre-professional programs and even other liberal arts programs just couldn't match. I graduated from Tufts with the ability to constantly take on new challenges in new fields and quickly become an asset to my teams. In the ~6 years since I graduated I've been able to take on roles in healthcare and finance on more than 5 different teams across 2 different companies with the confidence that I could learn enough to help. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because of the people and the community that I found there. In particular, what drew me more than anything was that no one at Tufts had just one interest. I met Economics majors taking on minors in Fine Arts, Engineers interested in Tae Kwon Do, and so many other incredibly special people who were empowered to pursue all of their myriad passions at Tufts. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Christopher Manos, the head of the Finance Minor, is the single most impactful teacher I had at Tufts. Professor Manos' unique capability to take a potentially dry subject and make it not only tangible but accessible to a wide variety of students is a truly special skill and I couldn't recommend his courses more highly! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Interdisciplinary Studies Name: Sean Lee Graduating Class: 2019 Major/Minor: Conservation Through Multimedia Storytelling (Interdisciplinary Studies), Environmental Studies Email: [seanlee.earth@gmail.com](mailto:seanlee.earth@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Watershed Stewards Program Corpsmember, Grassroots Ecology (through the California Conservation Corps and AmeriCorps) How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? The close relationships I developed with my professors and college friends provided a community and network that helped me grow into the person I am today. The classes expanded my paradigm and opened my eyes to find possibilities and opportunities everywhere. The wide assortment of clubs and extracurriculars let me explore and find activities I'm passionate about. Why did you choose Tufts? The campus culture encourages collaboration and exploration. The Experimental College offers a truly unique selection of courses and teachers. The courses were designed to provide guidance and give students multiple opportunities to collaborate on projects. How did you land on your decided major/minor? My professors encouraged me to choose my own destiny and design my own interdisciplinary studies major. Thinking back, I remember I was inspired by the documentary, Chasing Ice, to pursue a degree related to helping the environment. So it made sense I was drawn to Ecology and Film and Media Studies. But then I came across a poster that said, \"Anthropology is storytelling,\" and I realized that I needed to create a major centering on the power of story. Pairing nicely with my Environmental Studies major, Conservation Through Multimedia Storytelling gave me more agency to choose classes I was passionate about and make the best of the Tufts curriculum. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Yes, my major played an important key factor in my current position today. It has almost always come up in my job interviews, and I set myself apart at any conference. The Ecology side of Biology gave me the scientific and statistical knowledge to understand complex systems. Film and Media Studies gave me the technical and artistic skills to create engaging multimedia content and recognize patterns of theme and narrative. And Anthropology expanded my perspective by making me go beyond false dichotomies and forming connections through culture. Combining all of these disciplines, and focusing on the importance of diverse voices in environmental storytelling gave me a wide range of knowledge and skill sets to draw on, but also a focus to apply my findings. It has helped me with community engagement, career development, networking, internal and external communication, and DEIJ (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice) work in the environmental field. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Professors: Ninian Stein in Environment Studies, Sara Lewis in Biology, Julie Dobrow in Interdisciplinary Studies, Natalie Minik in FMS, Alex Blanchette in Anthropology, Norah Warchola in Biology, and so many other professors have played a key role during my time at Tufts. They always had time to meet with me during office hours to chat about classes and life, even if I was not taking one of their classes during that semester. They have provided guidance and resources during challenging times and were all extremely supportive of my thesis pursuits. They believed in me even when I did not, providing safe spaces of compassion, empathy, and wisdom. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was the Co-President of the Tufts Buddhist Mindfulness Sangha. Through the Tufts Mountain Club, I led students to do habitat restoration in the Middlesex Fells and creek cleanups in the Malden River. I led the Climate Strike with over 400 students from Tufts into Boston in September 2019 with the help of Tufts Sunrise and Tufts Climate Action. I engaged with campus-wide coalition work such as the Tufts Dining Coalition. I danced competitively with the Tufts Ballroom Team for two years. I practiced and performed piano the entire four years, playing the entire \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" by Modest Mussorgsky during my senior recital. I was a founding member of Public Harmony, a service-oriented organization that brought music to women's centers and children's hospitals. I was in FOCUS pre-orientation. I made life-long friends through all of these groups and stay connected to this day. _____________________________________________________________________________________ International Literary and Visual Studies Name: Fara White Graduating Class: 2004 Major/Minor: International Literary and Visual Studies Email: [farawhite@gmail.com](mailto:farawhite@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Psychiatrist in private practice, Self-Employed How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts is a place that allowed me to explore a lot of different interests, and its supportive environment gave me plenty of time to decide on my future. When I wanted to go to medical school after graduating with a degree outside the sciences, the premed office was there to guide me. I'll always be grateful for that, since I know it would have been impossible without their support and encouragement. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts since it offered exactly what I was looking for in terms of campus life and academics. There was a small school feel but it offered a lot of the benefits of a big university, which was very appealing. _____________________________________________________________________________________ International Relations Name: Virginia Stults Brenman Graduating Class: 1989 International Relations, Economics Email: [virginiastults@gmail.com](mailto:virginiastults@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Retired, VP of Marketing, L'Or\u00e9al USA How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Thanks to my Tufts education I solve problems holistically taking different perspectives into account. This approach helped me stand out from my peers in the business world by identifying unique solutions and helped me advance in my career. Compared with friends who went to other schools, I find that my Tufts friends are interested and well-versed in a wide range of topics. I credit our liberal education for this open mindedness and interest in continuing to learn. In addition to making lifelong friends, I met my husband at Tufts. This fall it will be 35 years since our first date in Harvard Square! Why did you choose Tufts? I was first interested in Tufts because I wanted to major in International Relations. When I visited the campus, I had a strong gut feeling that I had not felt anywhere else, that Tufts was the right place for me. The smart, interesting people I met, the beautiful campus with access to a major city, the size of the school all factored into why I fell in love with Tufts. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? One summer, I worked for an Art History professor who was writing a book on the Impressionists. I helped with all aspects of her research including translating unpublished letters from French to English. I even got a credit in her book when it was published! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Yufei Du Graduating Class: 2015 Major/Minor: International Relations, Economics, Political Science Current Employer & Position: PhD candidate, City University of Hong Kong How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? So much! mentorship above all. I still keep close contact with my Tufts supervisors who guided me in life as well as in my academic career. The other thing would be an open mind to accept others and myself. Comparing my high school self and post-college self, I know what a great difference Tufts experience had made for me. Why did you choose Tufts? The close-knit relations between faculties and students I would say (my supervisors Prof. David Dapple, Prof. Elizabeth Remick, Prof. Tony Smith all spent so much effort cultivating my mind & my heart), and between administrators and students (a shout out to Dean Herbert who helped me a lot in my first year; and Nicole at the career center who listened to my stories with compassion). Of course, I couldn't have known all these the moment when I chose Tufts. That's what makes life interesting. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Vikki Garth Graduating Class: 1981 Major/Minor: International Relations, Russian Studies Email: [vikkigarth@gmail.com](mailto:vikkigarth@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Vice President, JP Morgan How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts gave me the analytical skills, the exposure to people from all over the world, the opportunity to live in several different countries, the confidence and gravitas to perform in professional environments and access to an amazing network of people willing to share experience and assistance in my career. Why did you choose Tufts? Primarily because I was passionate about International Relations, in particular the Cold War Soviet Union. Tufts had the broadest programme to build my expertise. I also loved the Boston location, the beautiful campus and the very friendly, motivated, active-citizenship focused student body. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? The analytical skills and exposure to the entire world that I gained from the IR major has been extremely useful in an international banking career focused primarily on emerging markets. The skills I learned at Tufts from expert Kremlinologist professors gave me the insight to predict the collapse of the Russian Financial system in 1998 which saved my bank millions of dollars. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? I had many professors that were very special and very engaged with students. The one that gave me the most important skills for my later career was Sarah Terry, a Political Science Professor with special expertise in Poland and the whole Soviet Block. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Campus Tour Guide, Chi Omega Sorority, Field Hockey team, Leonard Carmichael Society. Don't really keep in contact with any of them today, but I am the upcoming President of the Tufts Alumni Council so I have been very engaged with Tufts in a variety of ways for 30 years. Please provide any additional information you would like to share about your experience at Tufts University to our admitted students. I continue to be super proud of Tufts - the role it plays in the world, the amazing opportunities it offers its students to travel, research and work around the world and the intellectually challenging academics taught by engaged professors. I am equally impressed by each intake of students, and all my fellow alumni - so passionate about achieving something with their future, so supportive of their peers, so committed to giving back to the world, so curious, but also loads of funds. You can go to any Tufts event around the world, even if you know no one and feel welcomed, enlightened and have a wonderful time! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Sarah Gordon Graduating Class: 2016 Major/Minor: International Relations Email: [sarahgordon2194@gmail.com](mailto:sarahgordon2194@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Project Specialist, Cincinnati Children's Hospital How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I'm an example of someone whose major does not match their current job experience. I think of this as a positive! You can study whatever you like at Tufts and still pivot your career afterwards into whatever you would like. Do not stress over choosing a major if you are undecided - study what interests you! However, I was hired at my first job by a fellow Tufts alum. The Tufts network reaches far and wide. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because the atmosphere was so welcoming. Students there want to learn and grow together. I made lifelong connections and friendships at Tufts. How did you choose your major/minor? I had done speech and debate in high school and was intrigued and energized by current events. International Relations was the perfect fit for me. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? FOCUS Pre-orientation! I was a leader and then a coordinator for the entire program. It is an outstanding experience. I also participated in the Programming Board which is now Tufts University Social Collective (TUSC). Such fun event planning and I still keep in touch with club members today. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Charles Hinman Graduating Class: 2018 Major/Minor: International Relations Current Employer & Position: Project Coordinator at Wellington Management Company How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? As a student of international relations, I developed the skills to understand complicated political, economic, and social relationships. The ability to identify the needs and objectives of different stakeholders has helped me navigate the world of financial services, where many actors converge to achieve similar yet distinct goals. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts is a place where it is comfortable to be yourself and express your passion for learning. People respect each other and challenge themselves to do their most for their community. How did you choose your major/minor? I took some of the foundational classes and found a professor that I felt comfortable asking to be my advisor. Once I had a game plan for my major, concentration, and required credits, I committed. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Yes, I've met others in financial services who have studied international relations and broad macro themes always get everyone's attention. Having an excellent baseline understanding of world affairs impresses people and encourages them to come to you for your opinion on current events. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Professors Taliaferro and Michael Beckley helped me navigate the international relations major and inspired me to submit some of my best work in their courses. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I wrote a capstone research paper for my international relations seminar course. It was one of my favorite assignments and was a high point for my ability to take a lengthy and complicated assignment under my own planning and judgment. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I joined the Tufts Men's Fencing Team and Tufts Ballroom during my freshman year. I made longstanding friends in both organizations and enjoyed the opportunity to step outside my comfort zone. What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? I made a lot of friends during freshman year whenever we got snowed in. Challenges that everyone has to experience are great foundations for relationships! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Jessica Laporte Graduating Class: 2014 Major/Minor: International Relations: Global Health, Nutrition and the Environment Current Employer & Position: SOIL - Social Enterprise Advisor for container-based sanitation service in Haiti How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I've worked in Global Health since graduating across a variety of organizations in Haiti. Next month I am moving onto my first US-based job as a Community Health Program Manager for Vermont Youth Conservation Corps. I use both my degree and network from Tufts to guide my work. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts academic culture encouraged real world experience and service which helped me to develop the skills that I eventually needed for my work. How did you choose your major/minor? It led me towards international service opportunities and then led me to work in the field for almost 6 years Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Karen Kosinski, Danielle Lantagne What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Tufts Christian Fellowship, Tufts Mountain Club _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Adrienne Larson Graduating Class: 2016 Major/Minor: International Relations, Economics, Community Health Current Employer & Position: Private Equity Analyst, Idinvest Partners; Masters in Business at HEC Paris & Yale School of Management How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Professionally, Tufts offered me an unparalleled education in international economics and led me to my first job at the World Bank, and to my top choice graduate programs. Personally, it brought me life-long best friends, and an incredible travel experiences in Argentina, Mexico and Jordan. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts is the best location you can find for a college experience. You have the best of both worlds: an accessible city, and the bubble-life of a campus. Also, most importantly, the PEOPLE. Tufts is special as an institution because of the exceptionally high proportion of genuine, curious, well-meaning, down-to-earth, and just cool people. I find that the relationships I made at Tufts only appreciate in value as I grow older. Anywhere I am in the world, when I cross paths with a Tufts alum, even if I didn't know them at school, I can be fairly certain that we will get along and that they will be doing something interesting with their lives. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Kohn Liu Graduating Class: 2002 Major/Minor: International Email: [kohn@acgsbrands.com](mailto:kohn@acgsbrands.com) Current Employer & Position: President, ACGS Brands Inc How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? I was able to balance my academic and social life during college and had opportunities to explore my interests through the elective classes at Tufts. Together the education allowed me to really \"explore\" the possible combination of interests, passions, skill-sets to create a life path of my own. Why did you choose Tufts? I wanted to be on the East Coast, and at a liberal arts school where I can have the opportunities to learn from a wide range of subjects. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Yes - through the IR Junior Year Exchange program I went to Japan which facilitated me doing international trade. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was a Peer Leader at the Asian American Center and Vice President (Sophomore), Co-President (Junior), and King (Senior) of TAST (Taiwanese Association for Students at Tufts).

Explore and discover who you are now, and who you want to become. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Ryan Rosen Graduating Class: 2017 Major/Minor: International Relations Current Employer & Position: Masters of Architecture Student How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts was instrumental in introducing me to new people, ideas, and career opportunities! It instilled in me a deep civic responsibility and commitment to positively engage with the world. It nourished my creative and curious nature. It encouraged me to study abroad three times, explore new class subjects, and interact with people from different backgrounds. Ultimately, Tufts helped me blossom into the human I am happy to be :) Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts unique balance between protective campus and urban exposure positions it as a safe and wild place, where tolerance is high but the world at large roams near. It has a fantastic student body size; you know people whenever you walk around campus but there is always someone new for you to meet. And it is those very people that you know and are yet to meet whom make the Tufts education so meaningful\u2014the Tufts community will always have a special place in my heart. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Professor Shevel is awesome! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Email: [maggie.selvin@gmail.com ](mailto:maggie.selvin@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Wharton MBA Candidate & Incoming Product Strategy Lead, Google How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My liberal arts education at Tufts helped hone the critical thinking skills and intellectual curiosity that have helped me succeed throughout my career. The international awareness and community empathy focus have also helped me remember that career is just one facet of who I am as a human. Additionally, I got my first job (where I worked for 7 years before my MBA) at a Tufts career fair, so Tufts very directly launched my business career. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because I wanted to study international relations in an interdisciplinary community where I could meet and learn from peers with diverse interests. I also wanted the New England campus experience while being near a city so I would have internship opportunities. I was also struck by how brilliant, and yet down-to-earth and warm, my fellow students were, which proved absolutely true - I made some of my best friends (and eventually my fiance) through Tufts! How did you choose your major/minor? I became interested in studying International Relations, but I actually didn't declare my major until the last minute because there were so many majors that piqued my interest (political science, anthropology, art history, and Latin American Studies...) In the end, IR was the perfect marriage of my disparate interests. I loved Spanish and studied abroad in Chile, and realized at a certain point that I'd nearly completed the major without trying and so I was excited to add the double major. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Adriana Zavala taught 20th Century Mexican Art, which has remained one of the best classes I've ever taken -- she offered such an insightful look at Mexico's socio political history during that period through the lens of art, which opened my eyes to how much I love learning that way. Peter Winn, who runs the Tufts in Chile program and taught my senior capstone class, also played a large role in my love of the region and shaping my worldview. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Konstantinos Veloudakis Graduating Class: 1988 Major/Minor: Literature Email: [dinov@bluewin.ch](mailto:dinov@bluewin.ch) Current Employer & Position: Asset Manager, Partner, Self-employed How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts opened my mind to the possibilities of combining disciplines and bringing together interests in ways I didn't think were possible. I also remember thinking that I would never again be in an environment like this, where you are surrounded by intelligent, curious and ambitious individuals. Thus, Tufts helped me to see that you can create your own path and encouraged me to seek and surround myself with intelligent individuals who are capable of imagining and building a different way of doing things. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts was my first choice, as it provided a very high level in the main areas of study I was interested in. I was not sure which direction to choose, and I liked that at Tufts I would have a year in which to explore the different disciplines. My father was also a graduate of the Tufts Dental School and was an Oral Surgeon. He was very proud of having studied at Tufts, and proud that he could afford to send his son to Tufts, a luxury that he had not enjoyed as he worked in order to complete his studies. Schools like the Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, and the variety and highly recognised disciplines in the Arts & Sciences such as the program in nutrition made Tufts the only school I wanted to attend. What I regret is only staying for four years...another four would have allowed me to study two more majors, child psychology and comparative religion, in typical Tufts style combining what may initially seem unrelated disciplines! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Jessie Wang Graduating Class: 2014 Major/Minor: International Relations, Community Health Current Employer & Position: Expedia, Senior Manager Strategy & Analytics How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I've moved many countries, cities, and communities and Tufts alumni have consistently helped me with my transitions both in work life and my personal life. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts is a school that challenges the way you think and what you are accustom to. Growing up in the South, I struggled with how far and foreign the Northeast felt. But looking back, I can see how much I've grown with the supportive of friends and peers. How did you choose your major/minor? I grew up abroad and so I always knew I wanted to approach things with an eye towards the international perspective. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I worked at MGH doing clinical research work on fibromyalgia for a fantastic researcher who even gave me a shout out in his journal article years later. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Today I sit on the Alumni Council where I've worked with the International Committee and the Career Services Committee. Of course, I love doing TAN interviews! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Anna Kang Weyant Graduating Class: 1992 Major/Minor: Asian Studies Email: [akang1@gmail.com](mailto:akang1@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Children's Book Author How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My coursework and junior year abroad formed the seeds of my first published book, YOU ARE (NOT) SMALL, which challenges our perception of what is normative or superior. Why did you choose Tufts? My dream was to become a diplomat, someone who could bring different worlds together through discussion and the discovery of common ground. One of Tufts' many strengths is its international relations department, its study abroad program, and its diverse undergraduate and graduate student bodies. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? My Japanese language professors, Teruko Craig and Charles Inouye, encouraged and nurtured my skills in foreign language and shaped how I saw myself and how I could positively impact the world. Professor Craig, specifically, encouraged me to study abroad. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Mathematics Name: Cici Chen Graduating Class: 2018 Major/Minor: Mathematics, Studio Art Current Employer & Position: Equity Research Associate, JP Morgan How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? I could not be where I am today without the help from many Tufts Alums who were willing to help guide me. I also received incredible support from my fellow Jumbos throughout the entire process. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts for its quirky Ex-college classes, for the SMFA dual degree program that helped me find my passions, for great food on campus, for tight-knit community and everything Boston has to offer. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Patrick Wild Graduating Class: 2021 Major/Minor: Mathematics, Economics Email: [patrick.wildj@gmail.com](mailto:patrick.wildj@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Associate Consultant, Putnam Investments How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts changed the way I approached unusual situations and helped me embrace my passion for learning. Tufts provided me enough opportunity to grow outside of my comfort zone and try new things, leading me to fully understand my true interests and what I wanted to pursue after school. Why did you choose Tufts? I knew what Tufts was before I knew what college was. My father has been a plumber at Tufts for over 20 years, so I always wanted to be one of the \"big kids\" that we saw on campus. Once I got older and realized my instincts were correct, Tufts felt like a natural choice. This was the school I had to attend. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Yes- my background in Economics and Mathematics help me understand financial markets more easily. In a similar sense, my majors are what drove my passion towards going into this field. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was the President of the Rugby team,and the treasurer for Delta Tau Delta. Both organizations connected me with some of my closest friends, most of whom I'm still close with today. I had never played Rugby, nor had any intention of joining a fraternity before Tufts, so I'm glad I had the opportunity to challenge my original plan and venture outside of my comfort zone. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Middle Eastern Studies Name: Maia Tarnas Graduating Class: 2019 Major/Minor: Middle Eastern Studies, Community Health, Minor in Arabic Current Employer & Position: Community Research Initiative; Massachusetts Tuberculosis Drug Assistance Program Coordinator How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts taught me resilience and confidence, two skills that are sorely needed in the immediate post-grad life. Above that, however, Tufts gave me a family and support system to grow with and from; the Tufts community is the giant on whose shoulders I can stand. As I begin my professional career, I continue to rely on advice from my professors and advisers and look to them for guidance. Personally, Tufts helped show me my potential and depths to myself that were otherwise untapped. I'm continuously proud of my alma mater and endlessly grateful. Why did you choose Tufts? I am from a very small cattle ranching town in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with a graduating class of 24 students. It is the very definition of a close-knit community packed with the 'aloha spirit' synonymous to Hawaii. At 17, set on moving to New England to fulfill my Hallmark movie inspired desire for seasons, bricks, and change, I resigned myself to the fact that nowhere would mimic the community I was used to. Stepping foot on Tufts' campus while touring, I was proven wrong by the immediate gut-feeling of home and belonging. Throughout my subsequent four years on campus, I came to understand that that feeling was entirely fueled by the people who imbue Tufts with its passion, love of life, and intellectual curiosity. The people are entirely what make a college so special, and the people in the Tufts community made it my home. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Professors Karen Kosinki, Shalini Tendulkar, and Adolfo Cuevas in the Community Health Department all are examples of empathy and kindness. They're endlessly fascinating professors and I continue to reach out to them for advice and because I miss seeing them every week. Rana Abdul-Aziz in the Arabic Department inspires me in her dedication, patience, and passion. Not only is she a fantastic professor, but she also teaches you how to love and understand a language beyond just the vocabulary and grammar. What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? I turned 18 a month into my first semester at Tufts. Because it was so early on in my college experience, I was anticipating a solo celebration and a FaceTime session with my family. Much to my surprise however, my roommate coordinated with my older brother to organize a delicious dinner in the North End. Even more to my surprise, she had a surprise party waiting for me in our dorm's common room with all our friends from our hall and my pre-orientation group. It was seasons-themed, as I had never gone through the 4 seasons before, so there were paper snowflakes on the wall and a necklace of fall leaves waiting for me alongside a birthday cake with candles. Our RA even joined us for karaoke! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Philosophy Name: Mikko Silliman Graduating Class: 2014 Major/Minor: Philosophy, Economics Current Employer & Position: Harvard University, PhD candidate How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My time at tufts taught me to think deeply, to focus on questions that matter, and not to be afraid of crossing disciplinary boundaries. While an undergrad, I formed meaningful relationships with several professors, who helped me navigate my many interests and find myself a path forward as a thinker. Why did you choose Tufts? I've now studied at four of the world's leading universities (Tufts, a junior year abroad, a master's degree, and now my PhD), and I can attest that nowhere else have I found professors so engaged with their students. How did you choose your major/minor? I started as an IR major - but quickly found myself drawn to the analytic nature of philosophy and the technical tools provided by economics. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? The combination of a rigorous framework for thinking about assumptions and arguments from philosophy with the practical toolkit from economics has helped propel my research forward as a PhD student, and ensures that my research attempts to answer questions that matter. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? I was fortunate to work with Professors Nancy Bauer (now Dean), Avner Baz, and Stephen White in the Philosophy department, and David Garman in the Economics department. All four of these professors made the time to push me further not only in the academic content covered in their courses, but also to cultivate my thinking as a person, and as a citizen in our increasingly complex world. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I was a Summer Scholar between my junior and senior years. Without that summer, I would never have had the time and space to write my interdisciplinary and ambitious thesis. Working closely with Professor Nancy Bauer gave me the confidence to pose questions to some of the world's brightest minds, and paved the way forward for my entry in graduate school (in a totally different field). What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I played club soccer, was a \"writing fellow\" (a writing-focused teaching assistant) and studied abroad through Tufts' program in Oxford. The most important aspect of all of these activities was the friendships I built with other people with similar interests to my own. Of course, I also learned a tremendous amount about writing and teaching, about belonging to a team, and about interacting with people from around the world. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Nancy Zhou Graduating Class: 2022 Major/Minor: Philosophy, Email: [linghui.zhou@tufts.edu](mailto:linghui.zhou@tufts.edu) Current Employer & Position: Incoming MALD student, The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? I enjoyed my time at Tufts as a junior transfer student from Shanghai. I was able to graduate on time while double-majoring in International Relations and Philosophy in addition to completing my certificate dissertation for the Tufts' program in Ethics, Law, and Society. These intellectual experiences through intensive yet rewarding undergraduate research under the guidance of prominent professors from the Philosophy and Economics Departments have prompted and sustained my multidisciplinary interests in international law, justice, and the ethicality behind globalization that will carry into my graduate studies at Tufts Fletcher. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because of the intellectual diversity, supportive campus atmosphere, and interdisciplinary educational resources that not only benefit my personal academic inquiries, but also allow me to form meaningful friendships and long-term connections with both professors and my peers. Surrounding myself with self-driven and open-minded people, I am passionate about learning at Tufts while growing and giving back to this wonderful community through direct action, internship, and volunteer work to bring about the Tufts values of equity, compassion, and accountability for progressive change both on and off-campus. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Peace and Justice Studies Name: Maia Raynor Graduating Class: 2016 Major/Minor: Peace and Justice Studies, Community Health Current Employer & Position: Legislative Director, State Sen. Sonia Chang-Diaz How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I was never confident, despite how often I was told by family or friends, that I should shoot for the stars. Tufts gave me the resources to try so many new things that were out of reach to me before college, such as travelling to Rwanda to learn about reconciliation strategies, choreographing my own dance pieces, and coordinating large fundraisers to support the empowerment of young girls of color. This allowed me to build up trust in myself in new spaces and places. As a black woman, this has allowed me to have a sense of confidence that has propelled me to be fearless in interviews, in planning for the future, and in advocating for my community. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because despite the school being only 40 minutes from where I grew up, I felt like I started a new adventure when I first went to campus. I was deciding between Tufts and Amherst College, and went to VOICES to get a feel for Tufts. I was immediately greeted by genuine, friendly, creative folks. Much like at my high school, it was more than ok to be nerdy, to be passionate, to be niche and that's why tufts. How did you choose your major/minor? I started Tufts thinking I wanted to be a psychologist, however, I realized that much of the mental health issues that we present are caused by generational trauma and systemic issues, so I ended up looking for ways to address those root causes, and found public health and peace and justice studies. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Moduhmita Roy is a queen! She teaches an amazing array of literature classes centered around women from the global south. As is Deborah Donahue Keegan. She was the first professor to lead a meditation for my class. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I did! I worked on research with the Eliot-Pearson school, and coded qualitative data on the impact of music education on youth resiliency and completed a research project on gentrification for my peace and justice studies capstone. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Physics Name: Pierre du Pont Graduating Class: 2016 Major/Minor: Physics, Minor in Mathematics Email: [psdupvi@gmail.com](mailto:psdupvi@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Data Strategist, Bigtincan How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I took a large number of courses that involved statistical analysis of data. I did additional projects with a professor in the Physics department that helped me learn how to present my findings in a clear way, as well as hone my data skills. I use these skills daily now, as I analyze customer data and build dashboards and reports for those customers. Why did you choose Tufts? I visited Tufts by myself one day, well before I had actually submitted my application. It wasn't an official visit, but I got dropped off by my parents at the Sci-Tech building and walked around the campus for a few hours. It was beautiful- almost peak autumn foliage. I asked random people on campus for directions and help, and every single one was friendly and cheerful, encouraging me to apply and telling me why they loved Tufts. It's usually hard to pinpoint the exact moment you fall in love, but I knew right then that this was where I wanted to be. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? I learned nearly all of my data skills from my Physics courses and research, and the mathematical skills I use in statistical analysis come from the math courses I took like Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. While I don't use physics on a day to day basis, the skills I learned are constantly applicable. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? I took three differential equations courses with Professor Christoph Borgers, and to this day he remains my favorite professor of all time. His knack for simplifying complex problems and his dry sense of humor turned what is often considered one of the hardest math courses into my favorite series of all time. Any time I needed help, I reached out to him, and I have fond memories of his free PDF textbooks for all of his courses. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I worked with Professor Cristian Staii in his Biophysics lab, where we measured the effect of different substrates on the growth rates and directions of neurons. I specifically did a lot of the statistical analysis to help out the Ph.D. student at the time, Marc Simon. I have one great memory of an all nighter so that we could take images of the neurons 2, 4, 6, 12, and 18 hours after implantation. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. I was on the 4th floor of Tilton, which had a beautiful common room and a lot of students who wanted to play FIFA. But we didn't have a TV. So we found one on Craigslist, an old Cathode Ray TV, with the giant box and everything, and 6 of us carried it up the stairs. It took about half an hour because it was so heavy, but it was worth it -- we got an XBox and started having gaming tournaments in the common room. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was a member of the Tufts Sailing Team for four years, and to this day my closest friends come from that group. We bonded over practices and regattas on the weekend. My friends and I go on an annual trip with each other to a new location every year, a tradition that we started in 2015. I also go back to campus to participate in alumni events or to run regattas for the undergraduates. The coach, Ken Legler, sends out weekly emails updating us on the successes of the team to this day. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Political Science Name: Yuhao Cai Graduating Class: 2016 Major/Minor: Political Science Current Employer & Position: Social Science Teacher, Self-employed How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? My spiritual life in music was developed there. Numerous on-campus job opportunities helped me grow and mature. Why did you choose Tufts? Great location, small class sizes, and a strong political science department. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? I'm a teacher, so I need to teach students how to read closely and think deeply. My training in political theory helped me immensely in this respect. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Professor Devigne taught me how to read and think deeply. Stumff and Hisako taught Class: 2017 Major/Minor: Political Science, Minor in Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Ethics, Law and Society Certificate/Minor Current Employer & Position: 3rd Year Law Student, University of Virginia School of Law (J.D. Candidate) How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I will be serving as a U.S. Navy Judge Advocate Officer after graduating from UVA Law this May. Through my involvement with the International Relations and Political Science Departments, the Tisch College, and student organizations like ALLIES (Alliance Linking Leaders in Education and the Services), I developed my interest in serving as a lawyer and in the U.S. Navy. The support and community that I received at Tufts allowed me to achieve both dreams: to get into law school and serve my country. I am forever grateful for my Tufts experience. Why did you choose Tufts? At Tufts, you will be able to take classes ranging from Introduction to Peace and Justices to Computer Science and find fantastic, entertaining, and brilliant professors in every department. You will have classmates who motivate you to work hard but serve as beacons of support and advice. Outside the classroom, you will find that Tufts has so many events going on that you will start wishing there were more hours in the day to go to everything, from standing-room only lectures by a foreign diplomat to acapella concerts. It is a wonderful place full of quirky, inspiring and fun people where you will grow as a student, a civically-minded citizen, and as a friend. How did you choose your major/minor? After taking AP US Government and Politics from my favorite high school teacher, I knew that I would major in Political Science. However, what came as a surprise was my minor in Cognitive & Brain Sciences (which I ended up taking as many courses for as I did for my major). I was inspired to pursue that minor after speaking with my friends who were majoring in STEM, and after taking the introductory classes I was hooked. My major/minor combination is emblematic of the interdisciplinary culture Tufts cultivates: what I learned in computer science helped me work out philosophical problems which in turn influenced how I approached political science questions. In some part, I planned my major and minors but in some way, Tufts led me to them. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? As a law student, my major in Political Science, my minor in Cognitive and Brain Sciences, and my certificate in Ethics, Law, and Society have all been integral. All of them helped me develop my writing and thinking skills, which are critical to the practice of law. In particular, Political Science taught me how institutions and systems work. Cognitive and Brain Sciences taught me how those inside those structures \"think.\" And Ethics, Law, and Society taught me how institutions and systems ought to be. What I learned at Tufts continues to help me today. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Professor Kelly Greenhill and Dean Jim Glaser played key roles in my Tufts experience. Professor Greenhill, to this day, remains an role model for me. I took Introduction to International Relations with her and did research for her. Her scholarship inspired me to pursue my own in the form of a senior honors thesis and what I have since published while in law school. As for Dean Glaser, I took Introduction to American Politics with him and he became my major adviser. I carry his wisdom with me today. In one meeting, I remember him describing to me, after I received some disappointing news, how he could paper the walls of his entire house with all the rejection letters he got over his life. What matters is the, perhaps small, stack of acceptance letters you do get and what you choose to do with them. That is what defines you. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was heavily involved during my time at Tufts, but, of note, I served in the leadership of ALLIES. ALLIES had an incredible impact on me, and I continue to support the organization when I can. More importantly, I rely on the network I cultivated through ALLIES on a weekly basis: the friends I made through it are friends I will keep for the rest of my life. ALLIES allowed me to connect with students at other colleges, universities, and service academies; helped me build connections in the national security field; and, inspired me to pursue the career I will be starting after law school. Whatever interests you have, there are student organizations and communities center on those interests that you will be able to access at Tufts. Through those organizations, I am confident that you'll develop similar positive and lasting experiences as I did through ALLIES. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Hayley Cohen Graduating Class: 2017 Major/Minor: Political Science, Minor in Chemistry Current Employer & Position: Graduate Student at Columbia University in the Political Science PhD program How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My professors in the Political Science department introduced me to academic research, encouraged me to pursue grad school and were integral advisors in my application process. Why did you choose Tufts? Two reasons: 1. Tufts creates community, family and home for its students and 2. It brings people with different interests together within a community. How did you choose your major/minor? I knew I wanted to study both subjects. As I started taking more advanced classes in Chemistry, though, I realized I didn't enjoy them as much as my social science classes. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Yes, I am pursuing the same field of study. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Deborah Schildkraut: gave me an example of superb and conscientious teaching to look up to and showed me how to marry interests in politics and quantitative science. Nimah Mazaheri: for encouraging my goals, introducing me to more advanced academic research, and answering my many questions about coursework and beyond. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? Summer Research Assistant at CIRCLE. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? A cappella, Hillel board, Greek life, Burlesque, etc. A cappella was certainly the most influential. It gave me a musical outlet, leadership opportunities, the opportunity to travel with my friends, and relationships that outlasted college. I see many of my group mates monthly as we live in the same city, we have group chats and I just returned to campus for my group's 25th anniversary. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Duane Goodin Graduating Class: 2005 Major/Minor: Political Science Current Employer & Position: Business Owner & Market Research Lead, Goodin Realizations How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Funnily enough, it wasn't my major that led me into my career, but my lifelong friendships and connections that I made while at Tufts. Market research wasn't a field I considered until after graduation, and I learned more from a friend who was working in the field. I love the mix of art and science that is market research. There is a bit of art to crafting surveys and eliciting useful responses from our respondents. I also get to flex my creative muscle when putting together reports and client presentations. Of course, in trying to understand human behavior, there is also the underlying psychology and hard statistics that add the necessary rigor and credibility. Why did you choose Tufts? A lot of what appealed to me about Tufts was the flexibility and opportunities to explore my academic interests, expand my social horizons and have a truly international education. For instance, I initially chose Tufts for its strong Engineering school paired with a stimulating Liberal Arts college and thank God I did! During my four years, I realized Engineering wasn't really where my passion lay and decided to pursue a Political Science degree. While doing my college research, I enjoyed coming across Tufts' course catalog and seeing the breadth of courses - from cutting-edge Engineering courses to courses on pressing world issues. Tufts also impressed me as a school that encouraged its students to get involved in the issues of the day and take charge in enacting change. I also adored Tufts' commitment to globalism - its diverse international student body, study abroad programs, and emphasis on what was going on in the world. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Joseph Goodrich Graduating Class: 2006 Major/Minor: Political Science Email: [josephgoodrich@gmail.com](mailto:josephgoodrich@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Deputy Director and Associate Dean of Academics, Marine Corps War College How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My Tufts experience taught me the value of determination and service over self. I have committed my professional life to serving our nation as a Marine Corps Officer and pilot and it is fun to see my fellow Jumbos excel in their professional lives as well. Why did you choose Tufts? I felt like a number when I attended a large Ivy League school, so I transferred to Tufts because the faculty and student body made me feel like a person. Tufts values individuality and there is a high level of trust and respect all around campus. Everyone is there to work hard and be successful. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? It was not a key factor in my decision to be a Marine Corps Officer, but it has been useful in my current position as the Deputy Director and Associate Dean of Academics at the Marine Corps War College. Understanding the political environment is key to any military strategy and we teach students how to think and act at the strategic level. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was involved with a Pre-Orientation Group, the Tour Guide program, the Radio Station, and various ROTC organizations. All of these experiences were positive ones but my most memorable was living in the mountains with new students during the Orientation week. It was refreshing to guide first-year students through the mountains of New Hampshire and take in the beautiful scenery. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Dinky Hammam Graduating Class: 1994 Email: [dhammam@hotmail.com](mailto:dhammam@hotmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Nonprofit Volunteer and Advocate, Self-employed How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Morphing from a Wall Street investment banker in New York City to an avid community volunteer in Oklahoma City was a breeze thanks to my experience at Tufts. Compassion and care were watchwords of my Jumbo education. Today, I have 100s of Jumbo friends all over the world and we are actually in touch. We even have done yoga together via Zoom (15 countries represented). Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? A Tufts liberal arts degree equipped me with skillful writing and discernment skills. I was easily able to manage a heavy workload along with having healthy communication boundaries. I found learning very easy and enjoyable thanks to Tufts boosting my self-esteem. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Brendan Hoffman Graduating Class: Email: [brndnhffmn@gmail.com](mailto:brndnhffmn@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: US Army How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts did not dramatically change the way I viewed the world or what I believed. What it did was give me the professional vocabulary and systemic understanding to explain my world view in an articulate manner. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts had a reputation as a top school that specialized in international affairs. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Kismet Lantos-Swett Graduating Class: 2012 Major/Minor: Political Science Current Employer & Position: Rhode Island Department of Education - Leadership for Educational Equity Fellow How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My time at Tufts allowed me to explore a diverse set of interests, ideas, and concepts. I learned things that challenged the way I thought and made me ask questions that challenge the way I interact with the world. Tuts empowered me to go out and find my passion (education) and to try and make a difference based on my passion. Tufts has made me a more compassionate and empathetic individual. Why did you choose Tufts? To be as corny as possible and even a little punny - it's the Jumbo heart of the community. Tufts creates a student and professional community that invites people in and celebrates diversity. To this day, there is a feeling of kinship that extends to any and all Jumbos - if someone is wearing Tufts memorabilia I will give them a \"Go Tufts\" greeting, and it is happily returned, I should say I have also been on the receiving end of such salutes. The students of Tufts come out and support each other, and even beyond that they support their local and global community as well. It is a place full of love. How did you choose your major/minor? I shopped around a bunch of different majors, Middle Eastern Studies, Anthropology, English, but I took the class \"Comparative Revolutions\" with Professor Elizabeth Remick - and that was it. I knew I had to major in Political Science because of that class. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? After graduating from Tufts, I spent several years teaching elementary schools in urban areas, and while I'm passionate about excellent education and education as a right for all students, I never felt that elementary education was the best fit for my skills and personality. This past year, an opportunity came along that allows me to continue to work in the field of education and specifically educational equity - but from a policy standpoint. I feel as though I have finally been able to combine my experience and passion for my major (political science) with my passion for expanding educational opportunities for all students. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? My advisor, Jeffrey Berry always gave such meaningful and thoughtful advice as I navigated class schedules and decisions. To this day, I get excited when I hear him on WBUR (Boston's public radio) discussing the election. Furthermore, his class on the American presidency is an excellent example of great teaching. I also took an English class with Michael Ullman, \"Major Figures of the Irish Literary Renaissance\" and he was one of the few professors who I really felt took the time to treat me as a thought partner and not just a student. I also had the opportunity to take a class from Stephen Cohen and also work with him through the Ex College - my conversations with Professor Cohen is what truly moved my interest in education to my desire to work in the field. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Richard Kramer Graduating Class: 1993 Major/Minor: Political Science, History, International Relations, Minor in French Email: [1970thesquare@gmail.com](mailto:1970thesquare@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: CRO, Investcorp How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts was an extraordinarily valuable bridge to the real world. Tufts connected me to a wider, mature group of peers; it introduced me to courses and professors whose subjects were tangible and applicable to real world events to improve my understanding of the world we live in; and built a platform that enabled me to continue further studies - including a hugely beneficial year abroad - and eventually a career. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because I felt it fit best with my interests at the time - a mix of academics, sports and an international outlook in a cosmopolitan part of the US. Attending a college with a university around it was particularly interesting. My choice was also heavily influenced by close family friends that had studied at Tufts who recommended it as a good fit. Plus I loved the campus when I visited. It all turned out to be as good - or even better - than I could ever have hoped. How did you land on your decided major/minor? My majors reflected the subject I was most interested in, so I effectively backed into my majors by virtue of the classes I took. Somehow I ended up with 3 majors and one class short of the fourth major in French so there is a lot of overlap between IR, history and Political Science. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? The choice of major is relevant because I carried on studying similar subjects in graduate school, which was part of the continuum to get me to where I am today. In that sense, choosing a major which I really enjoyed and wanted to pursue further was a key factor. However, the actual courses and topics studied were less important. My experience is consistent with the advice that one should focus on what one is good at and enjoys, rather than studying something because it's the latest fad or is a potential route to a hoped-for destination. It's harder to outperform or excel without a passion for the subject. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Professor Jenke was a Political Science and International Relations professor who connected the theory with the practice. He did so in the classrooms with his passion and energy for the topics, his support for the students, and his choice of reading materials which for me to this day created a huge interest in political biographies or indeed of writers such as Francis Fukuyama who are today so influential, but first introduced at Tufts. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. Hodgdon Hall, freshman year - what an amazing experience. first time away from home, and what an extraordinary collection of students - from complete novices like myself to \"wise, old\" seniors! My only regret is I enjoyed it too much, I got a bit distracted from my studies, but I managed to catch up in later years. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I played a lot of sports, including squash and tennis, and I still keep up with some friends from then, road trips were always a great bonding session. I contributed to the Tufts Daily, was associated with the IR club and tried to do as much as possible with the Fletcher school to capitalize on their fantastic resources. Please provide any additional information you would like to share about your experience at Tufts University to our admitted students. My general advice is to be proactive from the get go, there is virtually zero downside to raising your hand and trying. But try not to let your performance in classes suffer, it's important to maintain the balance of extracurricular activities with your academic performance. It's harder to max out on both, but seek advice and guidance along the way - there are lots of people around who have experience and can share a view which can help inform your decision making and path ahead. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Carol Lee Graduating Class: 1986 Major/Minor: Political Science Current Employer & Position: Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney's Office (until October 2021) How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts shaped my future in every way. My rewarding professional career as a federal prosecutor was grounded in my education at Tufts. More importantly I met my soulmate and life has been richer and better beyond my imagination. Thank you Tufts. Why did you choose Tufts? It was destiny. But how did I get there - you don't want to hear that it was one of the few schools I got into. You don't want to hear that I visited on a sunny day and was hooked. You don't want to hear that I have a family legacy at the school. None of these are deep, thoughtful steps to Tufts so I attribute it to kismet. Tufts saw something in me and I will always be so grateful to Tufts and feel incredibly lucky that I ended up at the school. I could not have foreseen at the time how my life would be so enriched and fulfilled by Tufts. I may not have been the best student there but the life experiences, the education, the grounding I received from Tufts, carries through to this day and has made me the person that I am. My Tufts soulmate and I have built a family that has empathy and love and compassion. We would never have found each other but for Tufts. I am definitely a better human being that cares about the world we live in and motivates me to give back and make the world a better place. How did you land on your decided major/minor? You don't want to hear that I had a deadline and needed to declare. You don't want to hear that I had enough credits for Political Science and almost History. This is not the way you shape life decisions. But I knew enough that I went on the path I was meant to travel. And it served me well in the future. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Without a doubt, political science at Tufts was enriching and thought-provoking and motivated me to attend law school. At law school I felt I could do defense or prosecution work. It so happened that I met a professor who was appointed to head the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice and my path to prosecution was formed. I served the public sector my entire legal career and I feel so rewarded because I felt like I gave back to the community and had a positive impact. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Several professors played a key role in my experience at Tufts because they were smart and thoughtful and kind and challenging. I can remember one from every year. And the ones I don't remember by name still had an impact on me. There was not one single class that I took at Tufts that was a dud and that also includes extension courses I took at Harvard. What a great experience to extend my learning to Harvard. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. Freshman year was a life changing year. I have a handful of close friends from Tufts and 30 years on - they are from my hallway freshman year. From the get-go I met people that made my life richer and from different parts of the United States and the world. To this day, they continue to fulfill and impress me. Tufts finds people that are intelligent, thoughtful, kind, funny, and are good humans. My Tufts friends are doing different and interesting things around the world and I am continually amazed at them. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I wish I had done more at Tufts and taken advantage of student life. I was so overwhelmed at being away from home and exploring Boston and Cambridge and studying abroad that I took advantage of everything Tufts had to offer. There was little room left for extracurricular activities but I watched my friends play sports, run the radio station, and run student organizations. Please provide any additional information you would like to share about your experience at Tufts University to our admitted students. I thought Tufts could potentially be just students from the \"tri-state area\" of NY, NJ, and CT. I thought it might be too small. But I was surprised, even in 1986, how diverse it was in so many ways - from the student body to the organizations. There's something for everyone. And I know that even more so now, Tufts' reach is far and that students from all over are drawn to the school. I couldn't have predicted how Tufts would change my life and it won't be the same for everyone and people certainly shouldn't go with expectations of such. But I can say from my experience, many of my most important things in life would not have happened but for Tufts. Tufts gave me my soulmate and we are so lucky. I don't want to oversell things but Tufts has taught me to embrace things as they come and it has made life that much more special. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Scott Nussbaum Graduating Class: 1999 Major/Minor: Political Science, Economics Email: [scott.nussbaum@gmail.com](mailto:scott.nussbaum@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Chief Compliance Officer, Blue Heron Research Partners How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? My liberal arts education helped me not only build a foundation in both hard and soft sciences, but my professors and classmates taught me about the value of thinking critically, how to properly read text, and how to contextualize our learning. Why did you choose Tufts? A Southern Californian, I wanted the quintessential New England college experience. Tufts' reputation, size and location perfectly blend the best of a liberal arts college and a research university on a gorgeous suburban campus near Boston. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Professor Jeff Berry, my advisor and Professor Jim Glaser were instrumental in my college experience. Professor Berry was an extraordinary advisor - wise, empathetic, offered perspective. And Professor Glaser led the most engaging classes. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was on the Crew Team; rowing in three Head of the Charles was a highlight of my Tufts experience. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Haley Schwartz Graduating Class: 2010 Major/Minor: Political Science, Community Health Email: [schwartz.haley@gmail.com](mailto:schwartz.haley@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Family Nurse Practitioner, East Bay Community Action program & Hope Family Health How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? My education at Tufts was the catalyst to where I am today. I loved both of my majors and became more interested in the medical field than I already was. I received my Master of Public Health from Tufts and during this experience, realized how much I appreciated public health and the upstream healthcare way of care, but also wanted to provide hands on care. After graduating, I received my Master of Science in Nursing and became a Family Nurse Practitioner. Working in a community health agency, I use my MPH and community health degrees daily during patient care. Why did you choose Tufts? Oh man-why Tufts? I could go on forever, and normally do with those I interview. The second I walked onto the Tufts campus, the energy was palpable. Everyone was genuinely excited to talk about their experiences on campus and why Tufts mattered to them. That's what stood out, people discussing why Tufts mattered. The course offerings, global focus, campus groups, ability for social activism, chance to create something that mattered to you--it all stood out. I remember looking at my parents after visiting campus and saying, \"I'm not going anywhere else, I want to go to Tufts\". How did you choose your major/minor? My freshman advisor told us to take one class that sounded interested--it didn't matter if it fulfilled a requirement or not, but to take something interested. I took Intro to Community Health and low and behold, it became my major. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Absolutely! I use my community health and public health world every day at work Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I worked with the Community Health department and Edith Balbach on her research. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? One major group I was a part of was the Student Health Organizing Coalition. We were a group of students from Tufts that worked to increase coverage for student health insurance in Massachusetts. We testified at the State House, conducted interviews with local radio and news programs and lobbied for better coverage for students. Many of these people are still friends to this day and we've attended important events in each other's lives. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Psychology Name: Eric Fuerstein Graduating Psychology Email: [eric.fuerstein@gmail.com](mailto:eric.fuerstein@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Vice President of Program Sales, Shorelight How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Absolutely! I got my first job through the Tufts Alumni Network, and I have been in the same industry as my second job for the past 15 years through a friend from Tufts. I owe my career to Tufts. Why did you choose Tufts? Great college town of Boston and just the right size, not too big but not too small, so you can meet new people all the time but feel like you are part of a community. Tufts is also full of people and students that are very talented yet also unpretentious, approachable, and friendly. It is a great, rare combination of traits. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? I would say my study abroad experience at Tufts played a key factor as I worked in international education. Once I lived in Madrid for a semester, I was hooked. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Yes, Professors Jeff Taliaferro and Sinaia Nathanson - both pushed me to think critically and gave me confidence to challenge myself academically in a way I had not before. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. I am still very close friends with multiple classmates from freshman year in Houston Hall! Really nice memories and an important time for me to learn how to live on my own and meet a new circle of friends. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Leslie Goldberg Graduating Class: 1984 Major/Minor: Psychology Email: [leslie.goldberg@tufts.edu](mailto:leslie.goldberg@tufts.edu) Current Employer & Position: Film and Media Studies Internship Director, Tufts University & Consultant, Self-employed How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts taught me how to learn and gave me many transferable skills, including problem-solving, analytical skills, excellent research and writing skills, and the ability to be flexible in my learning. As a liberal arts powerhouse, Tufts taught me to embrace many different subjects and to understand how problems in the world are solved at the intersection of disciplines. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts in part because of its proximity to Boston and its reputation as a small, collegial liberal arts college but also a strong research institution. I loved the New England campus and the \"feel\" of Tufts in terms of its friendly collegial atmosphere, its strong school spirit, its strength in the social science disciplines, its reputation as a premiere college, and its proximity to Boston. But in many ways, Tufts \"chose\" me. At the time that I applied, Tufts was not my first choice but after I came to visit several times, I knew it was the right fit. And it was absolutely one of the best choices I have ever made! Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Yes, as a psychology major, I learned how people think and react to situations, and I learned how important communication and \"thinking\" skills are in interacting with people. As a Tufts professor and a media consultant, I work with people every day--from students to CEOs of big companies. Understanding what makes people tick and what motivates them is an integral part of both of these jobs. My psychology degree really helped me in this regard. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. My first year roommate and I met in our very first hour at Tufts in Hodgdon Hall. We are still best friends to this day! That year in Hodgdon, we had an amazing group of first- and second-year students in the dorm and we all got very close. It was really an incredible introduction to my time at Tufts, and I stayed close with many of those first-year friends throughout Tufts and beyond. My roommate and I are grateful to Tufts for the amazing \"match\" they made when they put us together! Please provide any additional information you would like to share about your experience at Tufts University to our admitted students. I still work at Tufts in the Film and Media Studies program. If you're interested in communications, journalism, film, TV, or other forms of media, come look me up. I'd love to talk to you! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Employer & Position: Systems Administrator; Choate, Hall & Stewart How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? The Tufts undergraduate experience is a pressure cooker, but the skills gained, work ethic established, and the bonds solidified during that time prepared me for the world. I'm not scared about any problem size, or how to think about how to solve it, because Tufts helped me understand how to crunch numbers, understand data, understand existing biases within myself and others, and cut through the fluff to the core issues. You can go fast by yourself, but go far with others. You NEED your fellow students (and people) to make long standing changes and progress. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because my guidance counselor, Ms. Langan, suggested it as a better option to my other choices. I was looking for a school with intellectuals, prestige, and a challenging curriculum. I asked where Tufts was, and she pointed from out her window to the psychology building. I then asked my football coach, Coach Walsh, about Tufts, and he cosigned the Tufts program as being a great next step. The light bulb went off in my head, and I started applying Early Decision. Tufts's Medford campus was a stone's throw from my old school, St. Clement! I went there from grade 7 to grade 12. Unfortunately they closed down, but the school lives on with the alumni scattered across the globe. Finally, I lived less than a mile away from the school in Somerville, and I could be close to family if needed. When my freshman year ended, I walked back home to my house, laid in my bed, and said \"I just finished my first year of college.\" A pretty cool feeling, if I say so myself. How did you land on your decided major/minor? I thought I would be a doctor when I came to Tufts, and then I took Bio 14 and said never again. I then thought, what do I want to really understand? My answer was \"people\"; so I took a psychology and sociology course. I liked psychology more, especially the concept of social psychology (taught by Sam Sommers & Keith Maddox), so I went with Psychology. I didn't declare my major until the last minute, but I made sure the majority of my graduation requirements were being satisfied prior to declaring Psychology as my major. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Psychology has been critical for my current position, and my former position as a help desk analyst. When you're answering phones all day, or answering questions regarding system components, the issue is not only the technology, but the person sitting at the desk, trying to use the technology. Psychology helps bring an understanding of the end user's perspective, and tries to build the bridge of understanding between the caller and that pesky technology that doesn't seem to want to work for them. Psychology is one of the best majors to be the second of two majors, or a minor. Psychology is a great well-rounded, swiss army knife major to have, but in order to make jumbo bucks upon graduating, this degree won't translate directly to dollars without a Master's or PhD. However, a Psychology degree does help hone in on, and solve problems regarding the mind and the human condition, and you can leverage that knowledge to aid people in some fashion. For me, it was the linking of people and technology, which led me to my current position. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Psychology professors: Sam Sommers (my advisor), Keith Maddox, Heather Urry, Joseph Debold, Jessica Remedios, Dr. Patel, and Simon Howard (grad student). Helped make Psychology engaging, thought provoking, challenging, and fun. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was part of the football team for 3 years. While the team only won one game in my 4 years at the school, my absolute best friends were made on the team. The strongest bonds are forged in the fire, and those days definitely were some rough days. And I wouldn't take it back for a second. Those days taught me to dust myself off, try again, and keep iterating until success. Where there is a will, there is always a way. Please provide any additional information you would like to share about your experience at Tufts University to our admitted students. I suggest staying on campus for the best experience. Treat these four years as a laboratory towards understanding yourself. Experiment with what works and what doesn't work for you. Be responsible and own your screw-ups, whatever they may be. Reach out to the administration for resources, including alumni connections. Make friends with TUPD, and know the names of the officers who help secure the campus (salute to officer Moses). Give other people the grace you hope they would give you. Befriend people that you're living with, and the people neighboring your home/dorm. Find you a boo/boyfriend/girlfriend at some point during school, they make the tough days a bit better. I'm biased, but in general, downhill > uphill. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Justin Peque\u00f1o Graduating Class: 2012 Major/Minor: Psychology, American Studies Current Employer & Position: Kamehameha Schools, Project Manager (after completing MA in Politics and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University) How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I found my voice and learned how to build a supportive community at Tufts. I was involved with student activism and received a lot of practice in juggling competing priorities. Now, I do my best to empower others to find their voice and use the privileges I've gained to bring those voices to the tables where I sit. Why did you choose Tufts? Many Tufts students are wildly passionate about one thing or another and it's just a really interesting environment to live and learn in. Also, our alumni are proof that active citizenship can be a way of life. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? I did a lot of unlearning and relearning through my American Studies major and question every dominant narrative. This desire for truth and justice led me towards pursuing education and improving the lives of our most vulnerable populations. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Jean Wu was the first professor that took a special interest in me, as she did all of her students. She pushed me to reach outside of my comfort zone and share my story. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Arielle Rog Graduating Class: 2010 Major/Minor: Psychology, Community Health Current Employer & Position: Project Manager, Center for Innovation at Houston Methodist Hospital How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I always knew I wanted to have a career in healthcare, yet it was my Tufts experience that truly shaped where I am today. The interdisciplinary education I received through my undergraduate studies and combined degree program to obtain my MPH through Tufts School of Medicine opened my eyes to the importance of healthcare communication and the industry/business side of healthcare. Following graduation from Tufts, I went on to receive my MBA and live abroad for two years which led me on the career path journey towards healthcare innovation. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts holds a special place in my heart, even today 10 years following my graduation. I gained many of my closet friends at Tufts, immersed myself in the local community, learned about the importance of taking a well-rounded approach to everything, and had the opportunity to leave a legacy at the university which still remains today. I currently lead the Houston Tufts Alumni chapter and volunteer regularly to interview incoming Tufts students. Tufts is not just about the 4 years you spend there as an undergraduate, it is a lifetime of community. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Pam Shames Graduating Class: 1984 Major/Minor: Psychology, Mental Health Email: [rpshames@aol.com](mailto:rpshames@aol.com) Current Employer & Position: Psychologist, Private Practice How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? The research and clinical experience that I was able to have at Tufts was a huge advantage in applying to graduate school in Clinical Psychology. Why did you choose Tufts? The opportunity to go to a college where I could get to know my professors and do research as an undergraduate was a large reason I chose Tufts. And, the lifelong friends I made were a real gift. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? Yes, I worked in Robin Kanarek's Nutrition and Behavior Lab. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was the Treasurer of the Tufts Mountain Club for 3 years. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Julie Stone Graduating Class: 1978 Major/Minor: Social Psychology Current Employer & Position: Retired; owned a marketing research consulting business How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? At Tufts, I first became interested in psychology. The opportunity to work on research projects enabled me to realize that my career path would be research-based. Why did you choose Tufts? I wanted a school that was strong in both liberal arts and engineering. But the most important reason for choosing Tufts was that I felt at home the minute I stepped on the campus. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? My professional activities have all revolved around studying why people act the way they do, which is exactly what I studied in my major. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I participated in research projects as both an investigator and a subject as part of my experimental psychology classes. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Tennis team (2 years), Equestrian club and team (4 years). My experience as president of the equestrian club showed me that I could be a leader and that I could take charge of a project with many, many moving parts (running a horse show with competitors from many schools). _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Lauren Weiner Graduating Class: 2012 Major/Minor: Psychology, Community Health Current Employer & Position: Research Scientist, Happify Health How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? I chose Tufts to study international relations. However, my first class on my very first day of college was an introduction to community health, and I never looked back. After a few years of full time research experience, I went to graduate school for my PhD in Public Health. I am now working on the Science team at a mental health technology company, designing and running studies validating and assessing the health impacts of our digital mental health interventions, which have the potential to improve the lives of millions of people. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? The close relationships with faculty were definitely critical. Under the mentorship of my advisor, I received funding to work on an independent honors thesis project as part of the Summer Scholars Program. I would not have been able to do this without her support What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Tufts Club Tennis - still have friends I keep in touch with from the club. I was also the president of Public Health at Tufts. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Quantitative Economics Name: Amanda Babai (Huang) Graduating Class: 2011 Major/Minor: Quantitative Economics, Minor in Asian American Studies Current Employer & Position: Product Marketing Manager, Microsoft How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? It's all about the people and connections. I was introduced to a Microsoft recruiter through a Tufts friend. Also, I met my husband in Houston Hall in my first year! Why did you choose Tufts? Much like there can be chemistry between two people, there is chemistry with cities and colleges. When I visited Tufts campus, it just clicked. I loved the tour. I loved the quirkiness, the global focus, the cute campus traditions. Tufts had a fun and intellectual aura that just resonated with me. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Karishma Chouhan Graduating Class: Colonialism Studies Email: [karishma.s.ch@gmail.com](mailto:karishma.s.ch@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Analyst, Center for Radical Innovation for Social Change at University of Chicago How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? While Tufts has a gorgeous campus, I think I remember and cherish the people I met more. I was surrounded by peers, professors, dining hall workers, custodians, and others who all showed me kindness and compassion. Over my four years, that kindness and compassion gave me room to complicate and challenge my everyday life, and find solace in the fact that my identity was a malleable, protean thing, and so was everyone else's. Why did you choose Tufts? I think I originally wrote I chose it because I wanted to be in an environment where my interests were valid and worthy of sharing, and while Tufts does give space for a multitude of interests, I think now I would say I chose Tufts because I wanted to be surrounded by people who believed, as I do, that it is our responsibility to be empathetic of and helpful to others. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Adam Meyer Graduating Class: 2016 Major/Minor: Quantitative Economics, Minor in Mathematics, Finance Current Employer & Position: The Wharton School MBA with Finance Concentration How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts helped me meet some of my closest friends, many of whom I still speak with on a regular basis. These connections have helped me not only advance my professional career but have also been incredibly personally enriching. Of all my friends, only one other person is also involved in finance, with the rest ranging wildly from political campaigns, to medical school, to aid work in the DRC. By being surrounded by such a diverse group of people, I have been able to expand my horizons and see trends that others in my profession can miss. Why did you choose Tufts? I still have a distinct memory of visiting college campuses with my dad, and while most of the schools we looked at were interesting, the moment I arrived on Tufts' campus I knew it was the place for me. Tufts was the only place where I felt like people were actively enjoying themselves and the sense of community was immediately apparent. I can remember walking around campus, map in hand, and had numerous students come up to me and ask if I needed any help finding my around, or if I had any questions about the school. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Without a doubt the best professor I had at Tufts was Professor Manos. Tufts added the finance minor my Junior year and I was on the fence about adding another minor to my schedule, but I decided to give his intro to finance class a try. I can say that this class taught me more about the work that I currently do than every other class at Tufts combined. Professor Manos has an incredible passion about the topic and is always willing to go above and beyond to answer any additional questions you may have on the subject material. My Senior year he taught another seminar which I made sure to take and encouraged all my fellow economic majors to take as well. If you have any interest in learning about finance, I cannot recommend his class highly enough. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Jordan Rosenthal-Kay Graduating Class: 2017 Major/Minor: Quantitative Economics, Mathematics, Minor in Science, Technology, and Society Email: [jrosenthalkay@uchicago.edu](mailto:jrosenthalkay@uchicago.edu) Current Employer & Position: PhD Student in Economics, University of Chicago How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? The breadth and flexibility of Tufts' academic offerings paired with the amount of interaction I got with faculty allowed me to discover everything I'm interested in today, and made me realize that I wanted to get a PhD. In a world where I didn't go to Tufts, I wouldn't have realized I could mix my interest in both math and geography to become the (budding) urban economist I am today! Why did you choose Tufts? At the end of the day Tufts felt like the biggest small school or smallest big school, the best of both: tons of academic resources, classes, and clubs, but never felt so large as to be overwhelming or alienating, nor so small that I knew everyone and everything going on. I chose Tufts because I thought this would be true, and it was! How did you choose your major/minor? Total luck. I tried to get rid of the math requirement by taking a course that was two semesters of math crammed into one, and realized I loved it! Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? Yes! I was a research assistant for a professor at Fletcher at the environmental science / economics interface, and wrote a thesis in Economics under Professor Adam Storeygard's guidance. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I did a lot but I have to give a shoutout to Melisma Magazine, the music magazine. I loved working there, covering the Tufts and Boston music scene. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: John William \"Will\" Stephens Graduating Class: 1998 Major/Minor: Quantitative Economics, Minor in Studio Art Email: [j_william_stephens@yahoo.com](mailto:j_william_stephens@yahoo.com) Current Employer & Position: Managing Director, Credit Suisse How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts equipped me with the tools to ask great questions, look at data and make informed decisions and have an open mind with a wide perspective. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts has a unique character, which attracts passionate people with a wide variety of interests - there is always someone with something interesting to teach you. It also is the perfect mix of large university resources with the personal attention of a liberal arts college! How did you choose your major/minor? By trying a wide variety of classes and landing on an area I was interested in! What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Rugby, Student Senate, and working at dining services! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Allie Wainer Graduating Class: 2016 Major/Minor: Quantitative Economics Current Employer & Position: MS Candidate, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy MA Candidate, Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I am certain that Tufts has had a huge impact on where I'm at today because Tufts opened my eyes to new things, gave me the closest of friends, gave me opportunities to learn, lead, and listen, and challenged me in many ways, not just academically. My relationship with my thesis advisor not only landed me my first job out of college, but also remains an important relationship I maintain. Tufts helped me learn to trust my instinct (which I am still learning to do) and give back to my community so I did just that when I joined AmeriCorps at a Food Bank on the opposite side of the country. And when I decided to apply to grad school, I reached out to fellow Jumbos to ask for advice. Why did you choose Tufts? Why Tufts? Because there's always a concert, show, or speaker to go to that will impress you. Because if you don't want to go to a show, you will wind up having a two-hour long dinner in the dining hall with your best friend or someone you met in class. Because your friends will be doing the most amazing things while they're at school and continue to amaze you once they are living out the world. Because your classmates care about you and want to learn with you. Because Tufts pushes you to go abroad, to leave your comfort zone, to lead a club or two. Because Dewick has the best carrot cake. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Kaimeng Class: 2017 [kaimeng.yang@gmail.com](mailto:kaimeng.yang@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Data Scientist, Chainalysis How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? On the academics side, Tufts has a very solid mathematics, economics, and computer science curriculum. It prepares students really well. Besides that, there are tons of opportunities to participate, like clubs and activities, and interact with other students. Alumni are extremely approachable and helpful, in terms of answering questions and providing guidance related to my career search. Why did you choose Tufts? For its solid curriculum, amazing campus, super smart peers, and career related opportunities. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Sociology Name: Hannah Hussey Graduating Class: 2012 Major/Minor: Sociology, Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies Email: [hehussey@gmail.com](mailto:hehussey@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Staff Attorney, Children's Law Center How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Opportunities at Tufts to engage with LGBTQ issues in the classroom and through an internship in Boston set me up for a career working with LGBTQ youth - which then led to law school and my current position, focused on representing the interests of children involved with the foster care system. Why did you choose Tufts? When I was applying to colleges, I wanted a liberal arts school that had a defined, cohesive campus but also had easy access to a city. I found that in Tufts and benefitted from volunteer and internship opportunities in the Boston area. I also thought that I wanted to study international relations - and although I never took even the intro class in that major, I loved being at a school that had such a strong combination of study abroad programs and professors who could draw on perspectives from around the globe. How did you land on your decided major/minor? I took an intro to Sociology course and was hooked! I appreciated the lens it gave me to think about issues of equity in the United States, which had not been as available to me in high school. I then added a second major in what was then called Women's Studies, after taking a few classes at the urging of friends, finding a wonderful community of fellow students, and discovering that I wanted to continue coursework in that field. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? My Sociology and Women's Studies classes at Tufts gave me a solid foundation in thinking about racial, economic, and gender (in)justice that left me open to continued learning in jobs that engaged deeply with these very issues. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Many of my professors (as well as Tufts staff) opened my eyes to new ways of thinking about the world. I also benefited from professors who helped me access real-world volunteer and internship opportunities and assisted me in finding a job after graduation. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I completed a qualitative research project as part of my Sociology major, exploring the identities of feminist men, and wrote a capstone paper for my Women's Studies major - looking at asexuality through the lens of queer theory. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was active with the campus Women's Center, which offered a mix of opportunities to socialize with others who were passionate about feminism and gender justice, think critically about culture, and engage in advocacy on campus issues. Those experiences deepened my own identity and strengthened friendships that I continue to value today. I also spent time walking local dogs through Animal Aid and volunteering at an afterschool program in Somerville through Tufts After School Teaching and Enrichment - both with a roommate who remains a close friend to this day. _____________________________________________________________________________________ School of Engineering Biomedical Engineering Name: Alex Mitropoulos Graduating Class: 2010 Major/Minor: Biomedical Engineering Current Employer & Position: MilliporeSigma How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today?

I was the first in my family to go to college. Tufts opened a world of opportunity for me both through academics and lifelong friends. I felt supported throughout my four years at the University and was able to pursue many interests including founding and launching two new Tufts organizations. I landed a great job and later attended Harvard Business School for my MBA. Tufts allowed me to achieve success at a level I desired. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because of its location and reputation. I had a close friend whose brother was a student there and I knew how much he loved it. I visited, attended a tour and had an in-person interview. I knew it would be a good fit. It felt like a place I could call home that would offer me the chance to work hard, build relationships and gain a strong foundation for the next chapter of my life. How did you choose your major/minor? I was very strong in math and science and my amazing high school guidance counselor asked me \"have you considered studying engineering?\" I had no idea what engineering was but investigated and it seemed like a good fit. I loved the academic program and even though I didn't pursue a traditional engineering career, the degree has been invaluable in my approach to my work. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Yes. Engineering taught me to think logically, consider data, and use processes throughout my career. I've had many different roles including product marketing, new business development, and leading consulting teams. I have used what I've learned in all of them. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. Bush Hall was the best! The hall was coed by room and everyone left their doors open as an invitation to come in. This was pre-smart phone era, so walking up and introducing yourself to others was common. My \"floor\" mates are still some of my very best friends. A favorite memory was rallying the floor late at night of the first snowfall to go sledding down the hill. I hope this is still a tradition! It is a very fun experience. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Herbert G Weinstein Graduating Class: 1961 Major/Minor: Chemical Engineering Email: [texwein@sbcglobal.net](mailto:texwein@sbcglobal.net) Current Employer & Position: Instructor, Collin College, Plano, TX How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts gave me a very strong background in chemical engineering. This enabled me to achieve a Ph.D. in that field at Princeton. Following that , I had successful careers in oilfield research and secondary school education. How did you land on your decided major/minor? I had an older brother who was an engineer, and since I loved math, science (especially chemistry) and problem solving, chemical engineering was a perfect fit. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? My chemical engineering background has played a major part in my careers, whether it was oilfield research, consulting, or teaching. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? All of my Tufts professors - in engineering, math, sciences and liberal arts courses. I cannot think of one bad professor. I especially loved that all of my courses were taught by professors and not graduate students. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was President of the Society of Scholars, and I was elected to Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society in my junior year. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Chloe Wong Graduating Class: 2017 Major/Minor: Chemical Engineering Current Employer & Position: Engineer at Takeda Pharmaceuticals How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? As someone who is currently the only woman in her department at Takeda Pharmaceuticals, I feel that my experience at Tufts has enabled me to feel supported in the male-dominated industry of engineering. During my time at Tufts, I was able to join career-building clubs, such as the Society of Women Engineers and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. These clubs would set up events, such as conferences, tours at brewing and pharmaceutical companies, as well as panel and networking opportunities. Through these activities, I was pre-exposed to opportunities available after graduation, made more aware of social nuances I would encounter in the working world, and formulated long-lasting friendships that have also provided me with support and a far-reaching network. Why did you choose Tufts? During my college application process, I wanted to study engineering, but I didn't want to lose the opportunity of a well-rounded education. Most of the engineering colleges I was looking at seemed to only offer STEM based courses. However, Tufts was different because it encouraged me to take dance, drawing, psychology, and language courses in addition to the classes I needed to fulfill my Chemical Engineering major. I even got to study abroad in Australia my junior year. I chose Tufts because it was a great engineering program that allowed me to learn and pursue my passions outside of the conventional engineering curriculum. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? My adviser, Ayse Asatakin, played a crucial role in my time at Tufts. While most advisers discourage engineers from studying abroad because it often doesn't align with the course requirements, Prof. Asatakin invested time to assure my time abroad would not let me fall behind. She wrote many recommendations to assure that I would get into the study abroad program I wanted, and upon my return, she help brainstorm internships and research positions that I could apply to for when I returned for the summer. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? I participated in research at Charles Sykes' Single-Molecule Chemistry lab. His research focused on working with a scanning tunneling microscope that allowed for visual images on individuals molecules. Through working there, I learn to identify molecular orientations on catalytic surfaces for the publication \"Ullmann Coupling Mediated Assembly of an Electrically Driven Altitudinal Molecular Rotor\" which I am now an author on. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Civil Engineering Name: Gregory Bonci Graduating Class: 2006 Major/Minor: Civil Engineering Current Employer & Position: Physician/MD (Diagnostic Radiology), X-Ray Professional Association How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts fostered communication and problem-solving skills that greatly benefited me during my medical training and beyond. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts offered the complete package for me - far away from home, robust academics and extracurriculars, welcoming campus with urban amenities, and a wonderfully vibrant/diverse student body. My high school senior gut told me that Tufts would provide the life skills needed to succeed along with unforgettable memories and friends, and I was thankfully proven correct (with a Jumbo spouse to boot!). How did you land on your decided major/minor? I had an interest in architecture and math - civil engineering was an ideal amalgam of the two. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Eric Hines and John Durant were incredibly supportive and encouraged outside-the-box thinking. Both used real-world engineering examples in their teaching, often with no particular solution. This approach made me realize that professional life isn't always about finding the single correct answer but more about the process of coming to an acceptable and well-reasoned one. Did you participate in any research opportunities at Tufts? My senior engineering project was a multidisciplinary project related to a parasitic infectious disease (schistosomiasis) affecting a rural town in Ghana, exacerbated by the damming of a river by a gold-mining company. The project combined engineering strategies to limit public exposure to the pathogen (through well construction and modeling river flow dynamics) along with the medical/public health management of the affected villagers. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. I lived with my randomly assigned freshman roommate all 4 years at Tufts - two in dorms and two in an off-campus house. We remain best friends to this day! What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Men's soccer team for 2 years, cycling team, intramural soccer, SigEp fraternity, various community youth tutoring initiatives. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Chris Frano Graduating Class: 2011 Major/Minor: Civil Engineering Current Employer & Position: HNTB, Senior Estimator How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? At every step of my career, Tufts has been a part of my progression. I was hired to my entry level position through a professor referral. Then I made my first career move through a referral from a classmate of mine. Finally, I advanced to my current position based on my strong resume and two engineering degrees from Tufts. The alumni network and strength of the Tufts brand is evident everywhere I go. Why did you choose Tufts? Where else do engineering students have the flexibility to take multiple music classes? Where else does the varsity football coach reschedule football classes so that engineers can still play and attend their Wednesday afternoon labs? At Tufts you will meet fellow students of all styles of intelligence, genius, and diversity. It's a unique environment I haven't experienced or even heard of in my years before or since my time at Tufts. How did you choose your major/minor? Growing up in an Italian-American family, studying to become an engineer is about the most respected and noblest goal. I always wanted to see the product of my work physically manifested, so civil engineering felt like a great fit. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? I work for a company in which probably 75% or more of the employees have a civil or environmental engineering degrees, so it's safe to say I wouldn't be where I am without it. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? I've always loved bridges, so Brian Brenner, who is one of the premier bridge engineers in the country, absolutely played a key role. Masoud Sanayei and Lee Minardi were also great. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I played football for a year and was very involved with the lacrosse team. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Ilexa Gales Graduating Class: 2013 Major/Minor: Civil Engineering, Minor in Engineering Management Current Employer & Position: MBA Candidate at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today?

Tufts provided the critical thinking required to succeed as a global Project Manager. The education and classes were diverse. I had a small town view prior to Tufts. Tufts provided a global view. I am forever grateful for the education, ethics, and moral compass that prepared me to be successful on a global scale. Why did you choose Tufts? Intimate class sizes, beautiful campus, students equally if not more talented than the next, world class education, diverse, the ability to say, \" I went to Tufts\", and an administration that has always had my back when times were tough. How did you choose your major/minor? I was pouring concrete as a union laborer with a GED. I wanted to do more with my life. I opened up the classifieds and looked for jobs that I could potentially grow into with my current skill set as a craft laborer. All of the jobs that fit required a civil engineering degree, so I went back to school to get a civil engineering degree. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Almost all Project Managers and senior persons within the company are engineers. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Brian Brenner, Steve Chapra, Chris Swan - These professors had open door policies and spoke with me about personal and professional issues or concerns. After graduation I remained in contact with some and visited others when I would be in Boston. I still communicate with professors today. Lewis Edgers provided the direction on what companies to apply to based on what I wanted to do upon graduation. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? REAL - Resumed Education for Adult Learners Program. It provided a group/community of older students that understood the challenges of being an older student. Please provide any additional information you would like to share about your experience at Tufts University to our admitted students. Tufts was a great experience for me.

Tufts Rowing. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Electrical Engineering Name: Klaus Bartels Graduating Class: 1972 Major/Minor: Electrical Engineering Current Employer & Position: Adjunct Faculty, San Antonio College How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? My Tufts education is the most important factor in my professional success as an electrical engineer, Air Force officer, and teacher. My success at Tufts was also critical to acceptance to graduate school at MIT. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because it was clearly the best of the schools I applied to in terms of its academics, culture, location, and availability of Air Force ROTC. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: David Brown Graduating Class: 1978 Major/Minor: Electrical Engineering Email: [davidsbrown3@gmail.com](mailto:davidsbrown3@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Vice President of Product Management, Innova Medical Group How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? My biggest takeaway from my undergraduate engineering education at Tufts was how to think through a problem or challenge and come up with innovative solutions. This has served me quite well through my career, spanning design engineering, systems engineering, engineering management, and then a business career in marketing and general management. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts perfectly fit my profile of what I was looking for - small but not tiny, yet broad and diverse in its offering, a top-tier school difficult to get into so obviously intended for very strong students, and it just \"looked\" like what I thought a college should look like. I first saw it on a rainy Saturday in April of my Junior year in high school, but everything I saw and everyone I spoke to \"just fit\" - they seemed happy, challenged, and excited to be there. The broad extracurricular activities also appealed to me, as I was the kind of person that was interested in trying lots of new things. How did you land on your decided major/minor? Started out Chemistry/Pre-Med, discovered I didn't really like Chemistry, was thinking of medicine for the wrong reasons, and what I really was interested in was electronics and telecommunications - so I took the first Electrical Engineering course and then applied to transfer colleges. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? Definitely - would not have had the career path without it, as I worked as an Electrical Engineer for 15 years before getting an MBA and transitioning into general management roles. All of those have relied on my engineering background and it has been an asset throughout. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Two stand out: Denis Fermental, who became my advisor for my MSEE and was the friendliest, most helpful professor to undergraduates learning the basics. My undergraduate advisor, Arthur Pike, was similar. Both were clearly devoted to the teaching part of their job and quite popular with students at the time. Tell us a story around a residence life experience you had while living on campus. I was in a fraternity and one of the best experiences I can recall was all the fun around homecoming, in particular building our \"float\" on my old car to be part of the homecoming parade. Quite a creative effort to put it together and be a part of all that fun! What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Soccer - I still occasionally see a few old teammates at current games and one lives in the same town as me, and we keep in touch. Tufts Sound and Lights was my biggest passion, we DJ'd parties, provided sound and lights for concerts and shows, and I keep in touch from time to time with those friends, and of course Sigma Nu Fraternity and the IFC where my closests friends were, played intramural sports with, did volunteer work with - several of whom I speak with regularly. Please provide any additional information you would like to share about your experience at Tufts University to our admitted students. I really loved my undergraduate experience thoroughly. I describe it as the years I truly grew up and learned to be an adult, how to be a part of a real community, and by the way get a top notch education that I would hold up against anyone. Over the years I've worked with and socialized with people from all over the world, and believe I can hold my own with anyone. There were so many things to explore and learn. I could have spent 8 years there and not run out of new things to try or become bored, so I also had to learn to prioritize. Yet it was also small enough that if you really wanted to do something or try something, you probably could - the club, activity or class would probably not \"fill up\". If Tufts speaks to you, you should answer, you won't regret it! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: David Lackner Graduating Class: 2019 Major/Minor: Electrical Engineering, Minor in Entrepreneurial Leadership Studies Current Employer & Position: Inceptio Technology & Software Engineer How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts electrical engineering program prepared me for my job in the autonomous trucking industry. Tufts taught me how to be a professional engineer by providing me with the tools and project experience in the classroom. My Tufts professors and peers set me up to be successful in Silicon Valley. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts small class sizes and first class facilities provides students with everything they need to succeed. How did you choose your major/minor? Professor Jeffrey Hopwood in his Freshman Music and the Art of Engineering Course. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Yes, my major played an extremely important part in my current position today. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Ron Lasser What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Ice Hockey, Tufts Blockchain Club, IEEE _____________________________________________________________________________________ Engineering Psychology / Human Factors Engineering (SOE) Name: Bri Keenan Graduating Class: 2015 Major/Minor: Engineering Psychology Current Employer & Position: EF Education First, User Experience Researcher and Designer How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? I am lucky to be doing work directly related to my field of study. Tufts not only helped me cultivate specific skills needed for a career in User Experience, but it allowed me to meet people from all over the world and learn about their cultures and experiences. In my current job, I work with teenagers from 16 different countries who are doing an exchange year in the U.S, Ireland or the UK. My experience at Tufts opened my eyes to a world beyond just New England and the Boston Red Sox. Why did you choose Tufts? You will meet some of the most amazing people at Tufts, whether it's in the classroom, in the dorms or through a club. When I take a look at what all of my friends from Tufts are doing now, I realize how incredibly lucky I was, and still am, to be surrounded by such intelligent and interesting people from all over the world. I've got friends who are doctors, army rangers, working to solve global warming, writing for newspapers, engineering new products, managing political campaigns, and starting businesses. Tufts gives you the tools to change the world and surrounds you with people who share your passions. And also, Dewick chicken tenders are the best. How did you choose your major/minor? I started Tufts in the SOE and ended up taking a class called Usability Engineering for my elective as a freshman because it was the only thing that fit in my schedule. It was a class about designing products with the user in mind and before long it was the class I looked forward to the most every week. I ended up switching to Mechanical Engineering in hopes of taking more courses like my Usability class. I then found out that there was a major strictly in \"usability\" called Human Factors Engineering, so I switched to that and spent the next three years taking classes to fulfill my major requirements. The problem was, while I loved all of my Human Factors classes, I wasn't so great at Physics, static dynamics, and calculus. So, I spoke with my advisor and switched from the SOE to Arts and Sciences to major in Engineering Psychology, which had the same major class requirements as Human Factors, but less of the core engineering ones. Moral of the story: don't stick with a major just because you feel like you must. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? The job I currently do as a User Experience researcher and designer is directly related to my major at Tufts. While majoring in Engineering Psychology, I took classes in usability engineering, user experience design, user experience research and psychology, which all helped me grow my skill set needed to be a user experience professional. Like most careers, user experience professionals require both soft skills and hard skills and I was lucky enough to learn both sets while at Tufts. I consistently draw on my psychology background and understanding of product development that I learned in my classes and apply them to my work as a UX designer and researcher. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Professor Daniel Hannon played key roles in my experience as a student. Professor Hannon was the professor that taught my usability elective during my freshman year that introduced me to the field of user experience and human factors. I ended up taking several more classes with him and his passion and experience let me see the possibilities of a career in the field. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was a member of the varsity field hockey and softball teams at Tufts, which also happen to be two of the most successful female teams in Tufts history. During my four years, the field hockey team and softball teams won four national championships that cumulated in a 51-0 undefeated season my senior year for softball. I had an unbelievable athletic experience at Tufts. My best friends to this day are members of my teams and I am lucky that my softball and field hockey friends are all also best friends with each other. We still message each other frequently and while we live all over the world now, this just gives me all the more reason to travel and visit them. What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? My experiences in the dorms are some of my fondest memories at Tufts outside of being on an athletic team. You meet such interesting people you might not otherwise cross paths with and I loved that. Before I got to college, someone gave me the advice to leave the door to my room open whenever I could because it was a great way to meet people. My room my freshman year was at the beginning of the hall so I was able to connect with so many of my hall-mates early on because they would stop by and pop their head in looking for someone to chat with. There was one day my freshman year when, on a snow day, my roommate and I decided to have a Harry Potter movie marathon. What started as just the two of us turned into a hall-wide viewing party as people would walk by, see what was on and stop in to watch. You will quickly learn how much elephant decor is out there and you will accumulate more elephant decorations and clothing than you ever thought possible, and you will continue to purchase elephant memorabilia long after you graduate. Go Jumbos. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Angela Maliakal Graduating Class: 2022 Major/Minor: Human Factors Engineering, Computer Science, Minor in Finance Email: [angela.maliakal@tufts.edu](mailto:angela.maliakal@tufts.edu) Current Employer & Position: Incoming Business Analyst, Blackstone How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? The Tufts alumni network was super helpful when I began the career search process. I gained valuable networking advice and interview tips from young alumni who were working in fields I saw myself in. Some alumni even helped me practice for interviews and provided feedback. My time at Tufts has also helped me have a global mindset. My friends and professors have been unique and interesting and I have been able to learn a lot about myself and others through the community. Why did you choose Tufts? I chose Tufts because of the community! The people here are first and foremost nice and collaborative. Everyone I have met here also has such a unique set of interests that allows there to be a range of experiences and ideas that happen in group projects, random debates, and other settings. I also chose Tufts because of the opportunities available within the school and in the community. Being a top tier research institution outside of Boston, I knew there would be countless ways to try new jobs and get hands-on experience. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Christopher Manos! He was influential in my choosing to pursue a finance minor and apply to roles in the finance world! What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was the Director of Risk Management for my sorority, The Ivy, and the Director of Consulting Education for TAMID. Both of these experiences taught me so much and I am grateful for the community I found in both! _____________________________________________________________________________________ Engineering Science Name: Chris Gardner Graduating Class: 2012 Major/Minor: Engineering Science, Geology, Minor in Engineering Management Email: [christopher.p.gardner@gmail.com](mailto:christopher.p.gardner@gmail.com) Current Employer & Position: Director of Business Process Improvement, Nuance Communications How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today? Tufts Engineering program was so much more than just a pure technical education. The focus on group project work and being a complete person is what distinguishes our graduates from other Engineers. Why did you choose Tufts? As a senior in high school, I remember getting to an Accepted Student Day and just feeling like campus could be home for the next four years. Now 14 years later, my favorite thing about Tufts is the passion that your classmates (and soon-to-be best friends) have for their careers and interests. Their ability to evangelize that passion and be supportive using their unique skills and personality as life goes on. Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? The focus of my Engineering Science degree was Industrial Engineering (a major that Tufts didn't have, but had most of the classes for). Although I'm out of the manufacturing industry, my focus is still on process design. My major allowed me to think about applications outside of the obvious. I'd thank Professor Sam Liggero for that. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Professor Sam Liggero completely changed my academic path. He showed me the process design and I took off from there. Even today, I still reach out about once a year to catch up or for some advice when I need it. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Mechanical Engineering Name: Catherine Gao Graduating Class: 2018 Major/Minor: Mechanical Engineering, Quantitative Economics Current Employer & Position: Advanced Mechanical Design Engineer, Honeywell Aerospace How did your Tufts Experience help you get to where you are today?

Everyone is incredibly smart AND caring. What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? Tufts Electric Racing, Society of Women Engineers, Club Volleyball, Tufts Mountain Club _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Alex Kim Graduating Class: 2017 Major/Minor: Mechanical Engineering, Minor in Engineering Management Current Employer & Position: Thermo Fisher Scientific, Manufacturing Engineer How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? Tufts gave me a unique set of experiences for which to use in the engineering world. Currently, I am working for Thermo Fisher Scientific as a manufacturing engineer helping to produce the COVID-19 test kits to diagnose presence of coronavirus in millions of Americans. In this challenging time of life and work, my experiences at Tufts gave me the confidence to approach and collaboratively solve any problem to make the world a better place. Why did you choose Tufts? As a moldable, young person, there is no way to know for sure what you want to do with your life or how you want to live your adult life. Whether you are an art student, engineer, athlete, startup founder, march organizer, bookworm, or social butterfly, Tufts exposes its students to a variety of experiences that, when blended together, can only be described as the \"Jumbo Experience\". Regardless of what you decide to take out of this Tufts experience, students leave Tufts with the desire to have positive impact on the world and intellectual capacity to deliver on this desire. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Luisa Chiesa was an angel of a professor who would both converse with you as family and challenge you in the classroom. I helped with her research for a summer and had her multiple times throughout my Tufts career. I learned about everything from great pasta making to superconductive electricity from her. Her influence in my engineering and personal life could not be understated. She is an amazing human being and I am glad I was able to stay in touch. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Nelson Lam Graduating Class: 1982 Major/Minor: Mechanical Engineering Email: [njlam@comcast.net](mailto:njlam@comcast.net) Current Employer & Position: Founder & President, The Lam Group Would you say your major/minor has played a key factor in your current position today? I never became a practicing engineer, but the discipline of engineering and the mathematical skill required made all the difference in pursuing a life long career in finance. My first job was in banking at JP Morgan. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience as a student? Professor's Golsima Kamali and Alan Cormack. Both engineering professors, Professor Kamali was a young faculty member who really showed enthusiasm and a love of teaching/learning. Professor Cormack won the Nobel Prize in Physics my freshman year. It was so cool to have a Nobel winner teaching first year physics! What extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I served on the student Senate when not many engineering students were involved with governance. I worked on Professor John Sununu's (thermodynamics professor) US Senate campaign. I also lived in the Asian House my sophomore year. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Jessica Scolnic Graduating Class: 2013 Major/Minor: Mechanical Engineering, Minor in Engineering Education Current Employer & Position: Berkshire Grey, Mechanical/Robotics Engineer How did your Tufts Experience Help you get to where you are today? As a double jumbo, I spent 6 years at Tufts not only studying engineering, but becoming who I am as a human being. Sure, I built robots, designed new technologies, and did countless problem sets. But I also learned how to lead a team, how to be a good friend, and how to give back to my community. A huge part of my Tufts life was the Student Teacher Outreach Mentorship Program (look it up!) which solidified my technical knowledge while instilling in me a passion for inspiring the next generation of learners. I had a well-rounded experience at Tufts that made me a unique type of engineer: a \"big picture\" thinker with strong communication skills and a goal of improving the world through technology. Why did you choose Tufts? Tufts is a truly unique place where everyone is excited about something. Wherever you go, you'll meet someone who can broaden your horizons and teach you something new. When I was applying for college as an engineer, I was worried I wouldn't ever meet non-engineers, or have time to pursue other interests--at Tufts, I had nothing to worry about. I had room in my schedule for classes in education, psychology, Ladino, chamber music, and graphic design. I lived with, played frisbee with, and worked with non-engineers. I also had some spectacular professors who always had time to chat about class or life. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? So many great professors! My graduate advisor, Chris Rogers, taught me how to take initiative and create cool things (in a rigorous, grad-school way, of course.) Jason Rife is such a thoughtful teacher -- I'll always remember him using his kids' sesame street tinker toys to teach us advanced multi-body dynamics equations (it truly made it easy!) Merredith Portsmore taught me how to do research and how to read an academic paper, along with critical life skills like how to encourage and enable 60 undergrads to do meaningful work. I could go on forever. At Tufts, you'll find no shortage of professors who care about your development and education as much as they care about doing their important research. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I met some of my best friends on the Ultimate Frisbee Team (the B-team, \"BWO.\") That team was a place where I could be honestly and unabashedly myself, with all my quirks and silliness. At the same time, the team gave me drive to push myself as an athlete and become a leader. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Name: Emily Tannenbaum Graduating Class: 2018 Major/Minor: Mechanical Engineering, Minor in Mathematics Current Employer & Position: Benjamin N.

From that moment, I knew that I wanted to use my engineering degree to pursue a degree in patent law. This summer I am a summer associate at Lowenstein Sandler's Palo Alto doing patent prosecution. Additionally, I would not be where I am today without the help and advice from Professor Messner. His experience as an expert witness allowed me to gain an understanding of the field of patent law before entering into law school. Why did you choose Tufts? I wanted to be close to a city but have a college campus. I wanted to major in engineering but did not want to go to a large school or a strictly engineering school. The moment I stepped on campus, I knew this was the place I wanted to be. At the time, I didn't think I had a high enough ACT score to get accepted. I worked harder and obtained that dream. How did you choose your major/minor? I was always good at math and science, but didn't want to specifically major in one of the two. I did an engineering summer program in high school and that led me to applying to engineering schools. Then I took a human factors course for ES93, and that's what influenced me in my decision to do mechanical engineering. Would you say your major/minor played a key factor in your current position? Absolutely. I will be using my engineering and math skills at my job this summer. Were there any specific professors at Tufts that played a key role in your experience? Professor William Messner played a key role in my experience as a student. He did expert witness work and helped me with my engineering to law school transition. What Extracurricular activities and/or student organizations did you participate in at Tufts? I was on the TCU Senate my first two years, and then I was on the TCU Judiciary my second two years. I was also a part of Alpha Phi. I made the greatest friends who I am still in contact with today. Lastly, I ran the Boston marathon twice during my time at tufts. Senior year I was a part of the Tufts Marathon Team. This one honestly one of the best experiences I had at Tufts. Don is an amazing coach and mentor, and whenever I'm in town I make a point to connect with him. What additional information would you like to share with our perspective students? Tufts rocked! It really helped shape me into the "}
