The amendment was the culmination of a carefully orchestrated campaign by Dignity in Dying (formerlythe Voluntary Euthanasia Society), built aroundperceived public sympathy for high profile cases ofpeople taking relatives to end their lives at LudwigMinelli's 'Dignitas' facility in Zurich. Ironically theclause they were attempting to amend had beendesigned for another purpose altogether, to preventinternet promotion of suicide. 3 The amendment's resounding defeat by 53 votes (larger than the 48 in May 2006 for Lord Joffe's'Assisted Dying' bill), followed strong oppositionfrom senior legal figures, 4senior doctors,5disabled people's leaders6and faith leaders7and a robust debate in the Lords itself where the serious objections were eloquently laid out. Once again in this matter, by God's grace, sanity prevailed. Six days earlier the British Medical Association, at its annual representative meeting, had rejected a twopart motion (370) on assisted suicide. The first part,calling for the BMA to support legislation to 'ensurethat those accompanying the patient at an assisteddeath, but not actively participating, will not besubject to criminal prosecution' was defeated by52.6% to 44.4%. The second part, supporting a legalchange to 'allow the choice of an assisted death bypatients who are terminally ill and who have mentalcapacity' was lost decisively on a show of hands. 8 Baroness Ilora Finlay, Professor of Palliative Medicine in Cardiff, and Suffolk junior doctor Helen Grote spoke strongly against the motion,emphasising issues of public safety. BMA CouncilChair Hamish Meldrum and Ethics Chair TonyCalland, although emphasising this was a consciencevote, drew attention to the imminent Lord's debate and the profession's historical opposition to assisted suicide. In the same week, senior lawyers, among them former Chancellor Lord Mackay, had labelledFalconer's amendment 'ill-defined, unsound andunnecessary'. In a comprehensive clinical briefing,senior doctors led by Ian Gilmore, President of theRoyal College of Physicians, had criticised its vaguewording and branded it 'wide open to manipulationand abuse'. Over 30 leaders of the disabled people'smovement in the UK and USA, led by disabled peer Baroness Campbell, had warned it would'undoubtedly place disabled people under pressureto end their lives early to relieve the burden onrelatives, carers or the state'. 'We are scared will be terrified if assisted suicidebecomes state-sanctioned'. A cursory examination of Falconer's amendment confirms why there was so much concern.'Terminally ill' was not defined and could haveapplied to people with a wide range of chronicprogressive illnesses, some with life expectancystretching to decades. The 'assessing doctors' werenot required to know, to see, nor to examine theperson in question nor even to review the case notes;nor was it necessary they possess the requisitetraining, experience and skill necessary to makesound judgments about prognosis and capacity. Ethics aside, on pragmatic grounds alone a majority of Peers could see that especially at a timeof economic recession with imminent health cuts,with growing numbers of elderly people, and withincreasing levels of elder abuse, the last thing neededwas to put elderly, sick or disabled people underpressure to end their lives through a change in the law. Many of them already believe they are a financial or emotional burden. The current law's blanket prohibition of all assisted suicide is both clear and right and has stood the testof time. The penalties it holds in reserve give it botha stern face to deter would-be abusers and a kindheart to enable judges to exercise compassion inhard cases. The Falconer amendment would havecreated legal confusion by loosening a law thegovernment intends to tighten, to stop internetsuicides. What is not broken does not need fixing. The next day newspapers reported a case where it was alleged a woman had tried to murder herhusband who has motor neurone disease, afterlearning insurers would pay a six figure sum if hedied. 9It was a chilling reminder that not all family members necessarily have the best interests of their 'loved ones' at heart, and why the law must stay as it is.

At the timethere was media coverage of a potentialrelaxation of advertising rules that couldsee abortion providers advertising on TV.So I wrote a motion against it, which wasaccepted, and forgot about it, until anObserver journalist called me during afternoon surgery a couple of weeks beforethe ARM. Then a few days later the Mail on Sunday wanted some quotes, then Radio 4 Woman's Hour. Only the Mail actually ran anything, and that with an unhelpfulheadline, 1but it was generating interest! The motion was based on the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice consultation, considering revisions to thecode, which was out to public consultationuntil 19 June. It proposed relaxing the ruleson 'post-conception advice services', whichwould include both abortion providers andcrisis pregnancy counselling centres. It alsoproposed forcing such services to beexplicit about whether or not they referred directly for abortion. 2 The motion was debated at the ARM on 1 July, just before a motion on assisteddeath. It was clearly going to be contro-versial. I put the case that the BMA shouldoppose the move, as it would be: IUnnecessary - as information on abortion is readily available, and any woman who wants an abortion can find one already; IDiscriminatory - as only the big, government-funded abortion providerslike BPAS and Marie Stopes would beable to afford TV and thiswould effectively exclude not-for-profitcrisis pregnancy counselling centres; IGiving the wrong message - as raising the profile of abortion services wouldfurther permeate the message thatunwanted pregnancy is not such a big problem, because there's always a safety net. Furthermore, I called for existing sex andrelationships education to be values-based,to counter the values-free messagescoming from an oversexualised media.Sadly the motion fell. But it gave me somegreat conversations, including one with one of the speakers against the motion. It left me with renewed optimism in the opportunities for effecting change throughlocal BMA divisions, along with somevaluable lessons about tightening up thewording for future attempts! In the meantime, let's pray that the ongoing deliberations on advertising ruleswon't result in abortion TV ads - we expectthe decision in the autumn. 1.

A BMA debateReview by Mark Pickering GP and CMF regional secretary in York referencesReports of illness caused by the novel virus, influenzaA/H1N1v, known as swineflu, first emerged in Mexico in April. On 11 June, the World HealthOrganisation (WHO) raised the worldwidepandemic alert to Phase 6, indicating that aglobal pandemic is underway. This reflectsthe fact there are now ongoing communitylevel outbreaks, with person to personspread, in multiple countries. On 15 June,76 countries had reported 35,928 cases andthis may be a considerable underestimate. 1 The highest number of cases has beenreported in the USA, followed by Mexico, Canada, Australia and Chile. Globally, 163 deaths have been attributed to the illness. At the time of writing, over 2,500 cases have been reported in the UK, with theWest Midlands, Scotland and Londonbeing particularly badly affected. Muchremains to be unravelled about the virusand its epidemiology, but the highestnumber of cases has been among malesaged 10-19. 39 people have been admittedto hospital, while one patient in Scotland is believed to have died as a consequence. The UK was thought to be one of the countries best prepared to cope with apandemic, although the source was notavian influenza from South East Asia, asmany had been anticipating. The HealthProtection Agency (HPA) in England, andequivalent bodies in Scotland, Wales andNorthern Ireland, have taken a proactiveapproach to containing the virus. To dateover 60 schools have been closed at somepoint due to confirmation of one or morecases in pupils or staff members. There is much we still don't know about the behaviour of the virus, but there areconcerns that countries in the northernhemisphere will see a second, potentiallymore devastating 'wave' of influenza activityduring the normal autumnal flu season thisyear, as occurred during previous globalpandemics. Even if symptoms remain mild,a flu-like illness affecting a large proportionof the working population could have adetrimental economic impact in alreadytroubled times. The consequences forhealthcare delivery, of both staff illness and a potential sudden surge of patients,also warrant consideration. Looking beyond our borders, the rapid inter-continental spread reflects global-isation and a culture of easy internationaltravel. But the global spread of swine flufurther highlights the yawning gapbetween rich and poor. 2While Western countries invest considerable amounts in containment and mitigation policies,many developing countries will struggle to implement any such strategies in theface of limited healthcare resources. Unless otherwise stated all figures were taken from the websites of the Health Protection Agency and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Accessed 21 June 1. The Times, 8 June 2009 2. BMJ 2009;338:b1791referencessummer 09 triple helix 05 The case of Caroline Petrie, a community nurse suspendedfor asking a patient if shewanted prayer, hit the headlines in January and created a nationaland international storm. 1It prompted Bernadette Birtwhistle and others to tablemotions at the BMA ARM recognising theimportance of spiritual care, 2and that doctors and other health professionalsshould not face censure for offering prayerand other spiritual support. While themeeting supported the former it rejectedthe latter, although as ARM Chair PeterBennie reminded the meeting, even if theydid not pass a motion, it did not mean thatthe opposite held. We hold that spiritualmatters still belong at the frontline ofhealthcare. 3 This January, the Department of Health quietly issued equality and diversity guide-lines for NHS trusts on religion and belief. 4 While containing much of use, they arealso extremely vague and open to interp-retation on issues to do with expressingfaith in the workplace. 5At the same time the Employment Equality (Religion orBelief) Regulations (2003)6make it unlawful to discriminate against people onthe grounds of their faith. The legislationand the guidelines differ, and are open to wide and often contradictory interpretations, so creating ambiguity andconfusion for NHS staff and management. There is a major gap in health policy on spiritual care, in England in particular.While the Scottish Executive has requiredall Health Boards to develop policy since2002, 7and similar guidelines have been developed by the Welsh Assembly, there is nothing comparable in England. Somecentres, such as Southampton, 8have developed spiritual care policies and stafftraining programmes, but the overallpicture is poor. A recent Nursing Times survey showed that although most nursessaw spiritual care as an appropriate role,most felt there were inadequate guidelinesand a lack of training and support. 9 Caroline Petrie's case was not unique. She and others we know of admit that profess-ional bodies and trade unions are just asunclear about the rights and wrongs ofthese situations. CMF, Christian Nurses andMidwives 10and the Christian Legal Centre11 are supporting those who have beenaffected. Caroline sees her case as catalysingthe debate on the wider issues of the placeof Christian faith, prayer and spiritual care inthe NHS. 12It is important we do not ignore this challenge, but see it as an opportunityto speak up for Christ in the NHS. 13 1.

Colossians 4:4-6 In polls, 90% of the public say they support organ donation, but far fewerare actually on the NHS Organ DonorRegister - by this July the number was only 27% of those eligible (although up from20% in the last year). 1The Organ Donation Task Force concluded in 2008 against anational policy of presumed consent, thatpeople should have to 'opt out' rather than'opt in', thus agreeing with the recommend-ation CMF made as we endorsed organdonation when it is an altruistic free gift in a context of fully informed consent. 2 The Department of Health has redoubled efforts to increase donation rates, and thereare to be 197 new clinical leads and 197new 'lay champions', one for every acutetrust, as well as 63 new transplant co-ordinators. (It is this approach utilisingbetter communication and co-ordinationon the ground, rather than their presumedconsent policy, which probably accounts for the higher transplant rates in Spain.) 'Black and minority ethnic' (BME) comm- unities in the UK have a higher prevalence of the diseases requiring transplantation, but also a much lower proportion of theirmembers on the register, meaning thatappropriate tissue matches are less likely. TheOrgan Donor Campaign (ODC) has comeinto existence largely to fill this BME gap. 3 It seeks to reach BME groups through theirrespective faith communities, and began atthe grassroots in the north west, after severalhighly motivated young people separatelylost close friends who died while on atransplant waiting list, and was launchedwith a fanfare in Parliament in January. CMF has been in contact since the beginning, and is advising about reachingthe Christian community. At a meeting in Manchester this July, CMF along withsenior denominational figures took part in a workshop to explore these issues. Otherfaith-specific workshops will involve the fiveother major religions in the UK. Workingwith the Department of Health, the ODChave already trained 60 Manchester studentsto go out across the north west to raiseawareness (without any hard sell) of the gapbetween supporting the concept of donationand actually going onto the register. Theirslogan is 'Have you talked about it?' The Manchester students mainly come from Hindu and Muslim backgrounds, andtheir campaign further challenges Christiansto consider for themselves whether theyshould register. CMF acknowledges someethical controversies but believes Christiansshould support organ donation. 4 1. Department of Health, Manchester, 8 July 2009 2.

He reviews the subsequentperiod of momentous change for the profession and society atlarge, and notes the currenttarget-driven, over-regulatedhealth service with its reductionin the influence and power ofdoctors. If the founding fathers couldconsider continuing Christian witness in these complex times,they would still stress the priorities of prayer, a boldness to speak up for Jesus Christ, and consistent Christian living as the most powerful weapons in our armoury. The older I get the more vivid is my recollection of things that never happened. (Mark T wain) The problem with looking back in time is that it is almost as inexact a scienceas predicting the future. Even ifaccurate records are available, it is an enviable skill to be able to place events in theirproper perspective as far as their true relevance and importance are concerned. For many of us nearer the end of our careers it is generally when looking at old photographs, orviewing old films and television programmes, thatwe are confronted with the enormity of the changesin political, professional and social life that havetaken place over a working lifetime. This evidence,combined with the natural conservatism that usuallycomes with age, risks a 'rose tinted' retrospectiveview as we fondly look back to a 'golden age' of themedicine of our younger days. We wistfullyremember (probably correctly as it happens) thevitality of Christian life and witness that we recall as students. The risk of such a sentimental view is particularly strong when we reach a milestone as notable as a 60th anniversary! Founding father - the role of Douglas Johnson My own contact with CMF came shortly after I entered medical school in 1969 with a career aim of training in maxillofacial surgery, having alreadycompleted a dental degree. As a not so youngmedical student, I was approached to see if I wouldtake over as the 'CMF Students' Representative'.Thus I was introduced to the man who was probablymore responsible than any other for promoting thevision of a Christian witness in the profession, andwho ensured that the Fellowship prospered duringthe 25 years he served as its first General Secretary.Despite his natural reticence and antipathy to takingthe limelight, Dr Douglas Johnson (known to allsimply as 'DJ') was a seminal figure in the world of student witness in the universities and collegesduring the first half of the 20th century. A graduate in arts, theology and medicine, he had been General Secretary of the Inter-V arsityFellowship since its inception in 1928 (renamed theUniversities and Colleges Christian Fellowship in1975). In response to a stimulus from W M 'Bill'Capper (later Professor of Surgery in Bristol and ajoint Editor of 'Bailey and Love') he established amedical section of the graduates' division of the IVFin 1947. Shortly after this the leaders of the MedicalPrayer Union, which had a long and honourablehistory since its foundation in 1874, suggested thatmerging the two groups would be sensible in viewof shared aims and purposes. Thus the CMF wasborn in 1949, less than a year after the founding of the NHS, with an initial membership of 6-800. The MPU ('it did exactly what it said on the tin' - a continuing challenge to our own lack of prayer!)simply asked that CMF continue their regularbreakfast meetings at the annual BMA conference.This evangelistic opportunity continues to this day,usually with the BMA President in the Chair, andthere have been many distinguished speakers. 1,2 There were, of course, many other significant contributors, but since his name and considerableinfluence will be unknown to many, it is only fittingto pay tribute to the very important role that DJplayed behind the scenes in so many areas. BishopJohn Taylor ended his Times obituary: 'Little known in mainstream Christian circles and virtuallyhistory Andrew Brown revisits the priorities for Christian Medical Fellowship CMF AT 60Photo: PA Photos - back to the future?summer 09 triple helix 07unknown outside of them, Johnson did much to shape the church of the 20th Century'. Coping with change How has CMF developed since? Most change isincremental of course and we inevitably adapt to itas it happens. This is as true for institutions as forindividuals. The challenge for Christian organisationsand for us as individual Christians is to remain loyalto our calling and purpose in the face of change. This does not mean we should fossilise into an irrelevant status quo, but equally it does not mean we should just 'go with the flow' and mould andcompromise our faith to fit the prevailingworldview. The challenge for the Christian is alwaysto be a 'radical conservative' - remaining true toChrist's teaching and a biblical worldview whileengaging with and challenging the secularworldview that increasingly prevails, not least in modern medicine. 3 During the past 60 years CMF has had to grapple with these issues and many more during a period ofmomentous change for the profession and society at large. It has even been suggested that the rapidtherapeutic advances in many areas that took placeduring the four decades after the Second World Warrepresent a highpoint of medical scientific progresswhich will possibly never again be repeated in suchscale and significance over such a short period. 4Not surprisingly, with such amazing progress have comeincreasing ethical dilemmas. With it too has come a questioning of the profession and a readiness to apportion blame. It seems that the more thatdoctors can accomplish, the less forgiving arepatients and society when things go wrong. Ethical conflicts In the immediate post-war years, and even to someextent during my own training in the 1970s, medicinewas generally formal, hierarchical, conservative inoutlook, somewhat snobbishly superior, and oftenpatronising to patients and public alike. However,there was an unspoken consensus that a Judaeo-Christian basis for medical ethics was the safestfoundation and many routine aspects of currentpractice, such as abortion and embryo research,would generally have been thought completelyunacceptable. Battle weary Christian doctors today may feel that too many ethical conflicts have already beenlost and flinch at the even greater challenges thatloom. We are constantly reminded that 'all that isnecessary for the triumph of evil is that good mendo nothing' - although this pessimistic aphorismdiscounts the possibility of God's intervening powerand the certainty of an ultimate triumph over evil in Jesus Christ. 5 Priorities revisited But I suspect it was ever thus. Each generationbrings its own problems. Although much haschanged since the days of sports jackets andsensible tweed skirts for medical students (I've beenlooking at those old photos again!) the actual issuesfacing Christians in the profession today remain in many ways the same. Yes, the founding fathers of the CMF would not recognise our target-driven, over-regulated healthservice with its reduction in the influence andpower of doctors. Yes, they would have noconception of the interventional power of modernmedical techniques. Yes, they would probably besurprised at how quickly atheistic, materialisticsecularisation has triumphed in Britain today. But they would still stress the priorities of prayer, a boldness to speak up for Jesus Christ, andconsistent Christian living as the most powerfulweapons in our armoury. If we fail to make animpact as a Christian organisation or as individualChristians the reason is usually not far away from these neglected priorities. Back to the future The interesting question, as always, is to ponderwhat the senior CMF members of 60 years agowould make of the CMF that has emerged anddeveloped over the last six decades. I think theywould be amazed at the growth in staff numbersand the size and budget of the current organisation.They would marvel at the quality and professionallook of our publicity and publications, although they would have no idea what a website is! Theywould no doubt be encouraged by the growth of student activities and the literature and staffwhich supports them. I suspect they would be quite surprised at the activism that has resulted in increasing involvementin public policy debates. Most would be supportiveand perhaps a few critical of this move (including I suspect DJ himself) - possibly fearing a diminutionof gospel effort and a dilution of evangelical distinctiveness. This debate no doubt continues! However, I wonder if the founders would be concerned at a lack of active involvement in the Fellowship by many who would considerthemselves as Christian doctors? The rather selfishindividualistic ethos of our current society has creptinto the church, and many modern Christians arenot 'joiners' or willing to commit time and effort to gospel causes as in the past. Perhaps too theymay be concerned at the risk of relaxing into a'maintenance mode' with a temptation to confusebusyness and activity with effective Christianwitness. Looking back, we can only be grateful to God for all that has resulted from the founding of the CMFsixty years ago. Looking forward, we must pray andwork to maintain the basic priorities set by thosewho responded to the need for the medical world to be confronted with the claims of Christ.

They havealso adopted two children who are now teenagers. They believe the wider conceptand practice of 'adoption' is at the very heart of the Christianmessage, and share their personaltestimony. Current challengesinclude international adoption,adoption by single parents andgay couples, and prejudice against Christians. After words of encouragementand general advice for the 'childfree', they challenge allChristians that it is a centralcalling for God's people to lookafter those who have no family of their own. In the UK, at least 72,000 children and young people are looked after by the state on any given day.1Of these, 51,000 (71%) live with temporary foster families (often moving from placement to placement), and in England alone, 6,500 children areliving in children's homes which include securehomes and hostels. Only 4% of children taken into care in England in 2008 were placed for adoption. The average age ofthose being adopted was 3 years 11 months. Despiteover 60% of children in the care of the state beingover ten years of age, only 5% of those adopted were within this older age-group. Many children incare face a future of extreme under-achievement,instability, and poverty compared to their socio-economic counterparts. 2Only 15% of children in care will achieve more than 5 GCSEs grade A-C,compared to 60% of all children. 1A report in 2006 by the Centre for Policy Studies highlighted that of 6,000young people who left care, 75% did so without anyqualifications, 50% were unemployed within twoyears, and 20% were homeless (these figures areslowly improving). 3Of adults in prison, 26% have been in care as children, as opposed to 2% of thenon-prison population. 4 These statistics make desperately sad reading. Although in Christian circles there is much said and written about abortion, there seems to bedisproportionately little discussion or action onthese 'injustices of childhood' and the need forChristians to address them radically. A number ofstudies have clearly demonstrated that adoptionsignificantly improves the outcomes for thesechildren in terms of social, emotional, and educational outcomes when compared to both foster care and residential settings. 5,6 The aim of this article is to highlight the importanceof 'the calling' of adoption, and to suggest that thisneeds to be a consideration for all Christian familiesrather than just the childfree. We write this as acouple who are both involved professionally in thecare of adopted children. We also have the personalexperience of having adopted two children who arenow in their teenage years. We both agree whole-heartedly with the statement of Barnardo's that 'every child has a right to family life'. We also believepassionately that God's people have the resources to help make this ideal a reality. Biblical precedent for adoption Although there are clear examples of childhoodadoption in the Old Testament (Moses, Esther, and Genubath), the wider concept and practice of 'adoption' is at the very heart of the Christianmessage. This is seen in three broad ways: 1. God's adoption of us is central to our salvation In addition to the analogy of 'new birth', we findmany references in the New Testament in which oursalvation is described as 'God's adoption of us intohis family'. 7, 8, 9Indeed, we reflect on this truth in our musical worship each time we sing songs such as:10 Father God, I wonder how I managed to exist Without the knowledge of Your parenthood and Your loving care But now I am Your son, I am adopted in Your family And I can never be alone 'Cause Father God, You're there beside me We are also reminded in Ephesians 1:3-6 that God's adoptive plans for us were integral to his original purposes before the beginning of time. family Paul and Hilary Johnson have both professional and personal experience of adoption ADOPTIONPhotos: PA Photos - not just a calling for the childlessPhoto: PA Photossummer 09 triple helix 09We read that: '...[God] chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in hissight. In love he predestined us to be adopted as hissons through Jesus Christ in accordance with hispleasure and will - to the praise of his gloriousgrace.' In other words, this was not just a 'back-up'plan that God developed once he saw that mankindhad fallen. It was at the very heart of his creativeorder. God has adopted us 'in love' so that his gracecould be put on display most clearly. John Piper, a leading Bible expositor and strong proponent ofChristian adoption, has put it like this: 'Adoptionwas God's idea...He created the world so that therewould be a space, a place, a dynamic, and a peoplein which he could do this thing called adoption.' A key biblical foundation for the adoption ofchildren therefore is that God's adoption of us is at the heart of our salvation. 2. God's adoption of us has many parallels with our adoption of children While the heart of adoption is central to our salvation, there are also a number of practical waysin which God's adoption of us mirrors the act of us adopting children. These include the facts thatadoption has a personal cost (to adopter andadopted); it often involves rescue from very sad anddifficult situations; it involves changing the legalstatus of the adopted; it makes the adopted intoheirs of the person adopting; and it often stillinvolves some suffering in the present with thepromise of a fuller glory to come. These parallels(and more) have been helpfully discussed in anarticle we would recommend entitled 'Adoption: the heart of the gospel'. 11 3. Scripture clearly calls God's people to look after the 'orphan' There are many references in the Bible that remindus of the priority God places on the 'widow and theorphan', and also his ideal design and purpose forthe family unit. In James 1:27 we are told that'religion that God our Father accepts as pure andfaultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress...' If our faith is to reflect the heartof God, we need to ensure that we care for those in our society who are 'in distress', with a specialemphasis on children who have lost their birthparents. We must remember that the main priorityof parenting is raising and looking after children,rather than obtaining pleasure and satisfaction for the parents. Indeed, the biblical perspective of parenting is to enable children to be led intomaturity, and - through God's grace and aided byloving, godly, parental example - into a personalrelationship with Christ Jesus. A personal testimony Like many couples, we spent the first few years ofour married life carefully planning when the 'perfect'time would be to have our own children. In ournaivety, this timing obviously had to fit carefully withour different career pathways (one of the biggestdistortions of true Christian parenting), and we hadalso thought we needed to keep a careful eye on theever ageing ova! We both loved children and ourmain debate was whether to have three or four. God's plans were different! In 1995, we discovered we were unlikely to be able to have our ownchildren. This was devastating news. After the initialshock and sense of loss (and we would not under-estimate this), we slowly found ourselves beingmoulded by 'the potter' and being brought into hisplans and timings for our lives. We had both had aconviction from the very early days of planning ourfamily that we should adopt a child, although we hadalways thought this would be in addition to our birthchildren. Therefore, the transition to adoption for us was not as hard as it might have been. However, the richness of the journey we had to take to reach the point of eventually adopting asibling pair was something we can honestly say (in retrospect) we would not have wanted to miss out on. We had to learn first hand what God meantwhen he said in Isaiah: '\"For my thoughts are notyour thoughts\" declares the Lord. \"As the heavens arehigher than the earth, so are my ways higher thanyour ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.\"' 12 The whole adoption process made us reliant on Godin a way that we weren't before. It opened our eyesto needs in the UK, and further afield, that we wouldnot have encountered purely in our professionalroles. Most importantly it taught us that parenting isprimarily about the children. The splendour of beingadopted into God's family has taken on a newmeaning. Yes, adoption has been hard and costly attimes; yes, it has required sacrifices. However, it hasbeen a calling we would highly recommend andencourage other couples to consider. Current challenges and controversies In a short article, it is impossible to do justice to manyof the challenges and controversies in adoption today.However, we feel it important to highlight a few: International adoption In the search to adopt babies or small children, manycouples are now looking to adopt from overseas.However, this can present new and differentchallenges. While adopting babies overcomes someof the early behavioural challenges involved inadopting an older child, the potential problems withcultural identity when the child is older must not be underestimated. In addition, there is increasingrecognition that it is important in many situations tomaintain some contact with the birth family. Clearlythis can be difficult if the child has been removedfrom their country of birth. God's calling to adoptionwill be different for different couples, and meetingthe needs of children from all different backgroundsis all part of God's overall purposes. Adoption by single parents Although society would try to persuade us differently,family The whole adoption process made usreliant on God in a way that weweren't beforePhoto: PA Photos10 triple helix summer 09at the centre of the biblical concept of a human family is the stable and loving marriage relationshipbetween male and female. In the UK however,potentially anyone is now eligible to adopt if they are over 21, as long as they can provide a permanent,caring, and stable home. This eligibility is regardlessof marital status, sexuality, race, religion, and whetherthe individual is in work or has a disability. In 2008,9% of all adoptions were allocated to single parents.Although single parent adoption does not providethe biblical two-parent model of family, it can providestability for a child who has moved from foster hometo foster home, or has been placed in an institutionalsetting. Further, in cases of severe sexual abuse etc, it may occasionally be the preferred option. Gay adoption Since 2005 it has been possible in the UK for gaypeople to be considered as adopters. Indeed, thelegislation now states that gay adopters must beassessed equally with heterosexual couples. Whilethis is clearly at odds with the biblical view of family,it must be remembered that the alternative for manychildren is institutional care. There is currently nogood data confirming outcome differences betweenadoptions by heterosexual or homosexual couples.Interestingly, our own two adopted children were at odds with each other when asked whether theywould have preferred to have been adopted by a gay couple or placed in a care institution. Prejudice against Christian adoption Over the last few years, there have been increasingexamples of Christians being prejudiced against interms of adoption and fostering, as a result of theirdesire to affirm their Christian beliefs in the home. As Christians we need to ensure that the Godlyprinciples of family life are maintained, and thatChristian couples are not subject to unacceptableanti-Christian prejudice or bias. A message for the childless We are aware that some reading this will be under-going assisted fertility treatments, or having to cometo terms with the major heartache of infertility. Theseare difficult times. We are very cautious about offeringspecific advice that can easily be misinterpreted asunhelpful platitudes. However, as people who haveexperienced this situation first hand, we wouldsimply want to reassure and encourage you thatthere is 'light at the end of the tunnel'. The words from Jeremiah 29:11, although originally intended for a nation, were particularly helpful for us as a couple during those initial dark days: '\"For I know the plans I have for you\" declares the Lord,\"plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans togive hope and a future\"'. When you are ready, andhave come to terms with your loss, we would reallyencourage you to find out more about adoption.Although it is not a replacement for having your own children, it can be a wonderful alternative. We would also argue that it is more acceptable ethically than some (though certainly not all) of thefertility treatments you might be offered. On theother hand, we are also very aware that for some ofyou, childlessness (or 'childfreeness' as Hilary prefersto call it), might well be part of a specific calling toenable other avenues of Christian service. A message for all Christian families We believe strongly that the calling for adoption isfor all Christian people, not just for those couplesunable to have their 'own' children. That is not tosuggest that all Christians should actually be under-taking adoption. However, it recognises that thecalling to care for the parentless is something weshould all be engaged in. We must not forget that all children (whether our birth children, or those we have adopted or fostered) belong to God ratherthan to us, and have been temporarily given to us with the principal aim of demonstrating God's love and to bring him glory. We can all pray for, and support practically, couples in our fellowships who have adoptedchildren. We can recognise that these children willnot always fit the stereotypes of Christian childrenin middle England, and can remove the burden and stigma for adopting parents by showing unconditional love and Christ-like acceptance to their adopted children regardless of any behavioural difficulties they may have! We can follow the example of churches such as Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis in whichadoption is increasingly emphasised as somethingfor all Christian families to consider doing. We cansupport and establish further initiatives such as the MICAH Fund (Minority Infant and ChildrenAdoption Help) 13and the LYDIA Fund (Let Y ouths be Delivered from Institutions by Adoption)14that facilitate adoption by Christians. We can encourageall those strongly opposed to abortion equally tochampion adoption as the 'pro-life' alternative.Indeed, we would argue that any anti-abortionpolicy must have within it provisions for the many children who would then be born. A central calling for God's people We have tried to highlight the importance ofadoption. We believe it is a central calling for God'speople to look after those who have no family oftheir own. It is our prayer this article will haveinformed many, but will also have encouraged some to pursue this vital ministry personally.

In twelve months there have been: one set of exams, two jobapplications, three job rotations, more night shifts andon-calls than I wish to count, small groups, CMF, church, sport, one wedding proposal with subsequent planning and marriage, and two house moves. It has most definitely beenexciting, but certainly has been busy. This is not an uncommon list among Christian junior doctors. We spend all day or night busying ourselves at work, but have so manyoutside commitments that we are just as busy when not at work. I have had The Busy Christian's Guide to Busyness 1on my bookshelf for a good two years now, but yes, you have guessed it,have not found the time to read it. Or at least, I have felt that Icould not prioritise my time to read it. I have been grateful thoughfor the chance to write this article, which has actually made me stop and think through things, and for the opportunity to attend the time management seminar at the junior doctors' conference. (I would highly recommend all junior doctors to fit this weekendinto their busy schedules!) I am indebted both to the author of the book, and to Trevor Stammers for some of the followingsuggestions, which I have found useful over the past few months and hope that you do too. How busy are you? Cardiologist Meyer Friedman2described in 1999 a condition he termed 'hurry sickness'. He found that among others, symptoms ofthis condition included: regularly working half an hour a day longerthan your contracted hours, checking work emails at home, nothaving enough time to pray, driving above the speed limit, andfriends and family complaining they do not have enough time with you. Some of these I am sure occur daily for junior doctors. One of the exercises we did during the seminar was to compose a life matrix. Essentially it is a three-by-three grid into which you putthe nine activities that you spend your time doing. Once you havedone this, you write what percentage of time you spend doing eachone. On adding up those percentages, the majority of us totalledover one hundred percent, and among the common areas missedfrom the grid were sleeping and eating! It certainly gave me something to reflect on, and I have found it useful to come back to it as a way of reassessing how I am doing,and what I am spending my time doing that is making me so busy.What has the Bible got to say about time management? Work and rest Both work and rest are important in the Bible. Paul writing to theColossians urges us to work hard in all we do, as though workingfor the Lord, and not for man. 3Indeed, hard work is commended4,5and our satisfaction in it is a gift from God.6,7The Bible also commends rest. Rest was the culmination of creation; when God'swork was done, he rested. 8Jesus also rested, and encouraged his disciples to do so too.9In the same way that God rested, and that Jesus rested, we also are to rest. The idea is not that one is a means to the other, but that in our daily lives whether at work or at rest, it is all for the glory of God.The invitation is there from Jesus: 'Come to me. Get away with meand you'll recover your life. I'll show you how to take a real rest.Walk with me and work with me - watch how I do it. Learn theunforced rhythms of grace.' 10We just have to take up that invitation. Setting our priorities The Bible is very clear on how we should prioritise our time: we are to 'seek first his kingdom and his righteousness'. 11Where this world has one set of priorities, as Christians we are called to haveKingdom values. We are urged to be wise in how we live, and tomake the most of every opportunity. 12,13Paul was able to say that he had been faithful to the ministry that God had given him, and this too is the challenge we have. Putting it into practice How busy we are will naturally fluctuate throughout our lives, andalthough in itself busyness may not necessarily be a bad thing, thereasons behind it may be. Establishing the root of our own busynesscan be the start to tackling it. Identifying the areas that I particularly struggle with has been a start to addressing my busyness. I like having things to do, but I amnot good at saying 'no', which means I can end up taking too muchon, and being stretched. The result of this does not glorify God ineither work or rest. God has given each of us skills and talents, andfortunately we are all different - we need to concentrate on theareas where we are gifted, while remaining servant-hearted. 'The \"success\" of our lives will be measured not in what we have \"achieved\", but in our faithfulness.' 14 Katy Barker (previously Lane) is a busy FY1 in Leeds, but she's working on that!juniors' forum Katy Barker on busyness Making the most of our time references 1.

Op cit p.47Photo: PA Photos12 triple helix summer 09 key points Recognising the difference between medical knowledge in Jesus' day and ours, the author,a PRIME tutor, suggests Jesus'healing ministry gives clear guidelines for the practice of whole person medicine today. Jesus touches the untouchableand is touched by people's suffering, releases physically andsocially and spiritually, and nevercondemns. Unafraid to do what isright, he is flexible, sensitive, andpersistent. He looks for what isreally going on underneath illness,is prepared to get his hands dirty,knows the healing power of words,and teaches students. Noting Jesus never asks forpayment, the author pays tribute to Christian colleagues inEastern Europe who work for a salaryinsufficient to live on, because theylook to Jesus as their role model. Jesus is sometimes referred to as 'the great physician', but clearly his medicalpractice was quite different from ours. He had almost no effective drugs to call upon, surgery was extremely primitive and, in ourterms, he was untrained. Clearly none of that wouldhave made any difference to him. But we do nothave his power, even though the Bible teaches uswe do have access to it. Nevertheless, Jesus' healingministry gives us some clear guidelines for thepractice of whole person medicine today. Jesus touches even the untouchable Jesus frequently, but not always, uses touch as ameans of healing. Patients with leprosy or extensiveskin diseases were untouchable in his time, as were women with menstrual bleeding. Jesus isunconcerned with tradition or even with the laws of hygiene, and does what he knows is best to bring healing to the patient. The dermatologist who taught me as a student emphasised the importance of touching thepatient's damaged skin, even though it might not bestrictly necessary for diagnostic purposes. The act oftouching is a way of reducing the social and psycho-logical distance between the doctor and the patient.It signifies acceptance and inclusion, and helps buildrelationships by reducing feelings of rejection and isolation.Jesus is touched Jesus is clearly moved by the suffering of others,both patients 1and relatives. When Jesus saw Mary weeping for her dead brother '...he was deeplymoved in spirit and troubled'. 2Jesus is fully present when faced with the sufferings of others, and doesnot attempt to maintain a professional distance. Jesus releases Jesus describes the crippled woman he healed onthe Sabbath as somebody who was 'bound' bySatan. 3T nsocially; eg lepers can now re-enter society nand spiritually, as his patients accept forgiveness He works for wholeness in body and mind and spirit. However, this also involves giving peopleback their free will, which is clearly not without itsrisks. The paralytic who was healed at the pool ofBethesda is later warned: 'See, you are well again.Stop sinning or something worse may happen toyou'. 5This suggests that, in spite of his release from a life of sickness, the man continued to make badchoices. Maybe he chose to continue in a sick role.We do not know. I remember seeing two senior physicians leaving their outpatient clinics just before Christmas. One ofpractice David Chaput de Saintonge considers Jesus as a modelfor whole person medicine physician'Photos: PA Photos 'The greatPhoto: PA Photossummer 09 triple helix 13them carried a large pile of patient notes, the other a pile of gifts from grateful patients. The first doctortended to see patients once or twice only and thendischarge them, releasing them back to their homesand the care of their family practitioners whennecessary. The other doctor tended to followpatients regularly for some time and of course theywere grateful. I've no doubt that some needed to be followed carefully in hospital, but I suspect thatothers attended more for the doctor's benefit thanfor theirs. Doctors are for the sick, and not the sickfor doctors. Freedom from disease is about restoringautonomy, which is incompatible with fosteringdependence. Jesus never condemns He never condemns any of the behaviours of thosewho come to him for help and healing. The man at the pool of Bethesda gets a clear challenge and a warning not to continue with his previousbehaviour, but he is not condemned for it. Jesus is never afraid to do what is right The story of Jesus healing on the Sabbath remindsus that he did what was right for his patients in theface of inappropriate rules and regulations. In theWest we are increasingly constrained to follow rulesand guidelines for patient management. Thesecertainly have their place and have been shown,overall, to improve the standard of patient care.However, there are occasions where what might beright for the majority of patients will be inappro-priate for an individual. Sabbath rest is a goodprinciple, but Jesus knew when to step outside it. Jesus is flexible Jesus' flexibility shows itself in the way that hechooses treatments. Sometimes he touches patients,sometimes he doesn't; sometimes he uses mud onblind patients, sometimes he doesn't. Presumablythese approaches reflect the individual needs of thepatient. This is what you would expect from a Godwho knows each one of us by name. Jesus is sensitive He responds to need, not to status. Jesus' patientscome from every part of society and include the verypoor, the very rich, Jews, Gentiles, Samaritans - inother words, anybody who has need. Jesus respects hispatient's need for privacy. This is not always possiblewhen somebody approaches him in the middle of ahuge crowd. However, on several occasions he takescare to protect the patient from the eyes of the crowd. 6 Jesus is sensitive to the need to maintain his patients'dignity while he is treating them. Jesus is persistent Not all of Jesus' healing and miracles seem to havebeen instantaneous. He needs to put his handstwice on the eyes of one of his blind patients beforehis sight is restored. 7The Son of God is prepared to persist until his treatment goals have been achieved.Jesus checks his patients for motivation 'Do you want to get well?' he asks the invalid of 38years. 8He looks for what is really going on under- neath the illness. He checks out people's treatmentgoals and what exactly they want to happen: 'What do you want me to do for you?' 9 Jesus is not afraid to get his hands dirty This is not just a question of using mud. It involvesgetting into religious and social situations which the more delicate and fastidious might avoid. Jesus knew the healing power of words Maybe the majority of Jesus' healing miraclesinvolve the use of words. Sometimes, where theproblem was demonic, that was the only healingmodality used. However, his words were also used to reassure, to comfort and to strengthen. Jesus taught medical students The disciples were sometimes unable to curepatients and wanted to know why. Jesus tells themon one occasion: 'This kind [of deafness] can comeout only by prayer'. 10His students have not chosen the right sort of treatment for this particular caseand Jesus sets them straight. Teaching was the major part of Jesus' ministry, and here we see him combining healing with teaching. Jesus' motive was not money There is no record of Jesus ever having asked forany payment, and sometimes he didn't even getthanks. 11Neverthless, his physical needs and those of his disciples were supplied by those who followed and respected him. I am humbled by the dedication of many of my Christian colleagues in Eastern Europe who workfor a salary which is insufficient to live on. They do this because they are called to be doctors. They look to Jesus as their role model.

Three have an explicithealth focus. Current achievements againstspecific targets are reviewed for HIV and AIDS, malaria, and TBand at present they are going tobe met at best only partially. The author compares the extrabillions needed to achieve these targets with the trillions ineconomic stimulus packages andbailouts recently committed bydeveloped world governments,and asks whether the real issue isthe commitment our governments,and we to whom they areaccountable, have towardstackling the global health crisis? Triple Helix has previously highlighted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),1eight key commitments made by 192 member countries of the United Nations to address global poverty, withexplicit targets to be achieved by 2015. 2With six years left to that deadline, the next three editions of Triple Helix will review the three MDGs which have an explicit health focus. Progress towards these targets is regularly reviewed by the UN and other international bodies.It now seems few if any will be reached by 2015, but some progress has been achieved. The news is not as good as it should be, but is also not as bad as it might be. A big concern raised time and again is that the global credit crunch and recession will have a downward pressure on spending to meet thesetargets. 3The 2009 Data Report4shows that the G8 countries have given to date only $7 billion of the$21.5 billion in aid they had promised in 2005 todeliver by 2010. While a global debate rages overwhether aid actually achieves anything in terms of development and poverty reduction, 5,6there is evidence it can have an impact in healthcare. This is especially true in the delivery of affordable andeffective treatments and prevention for malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS. 7, 8, 9 HIV and AIDS Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV/AIDSrose by 42% in 2007. 10This represents an unprece- dented scaling up of treatment for any major infectious disease in the developing world, largelyfinanced by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,T uberculosis and Malaria. 11By the end of 2007, the number receiving ART in developing countriesreached 3 million, and deaths from AIDS-relatedillnesses had declined from 2.2 to 2 million a year. 12 However, significant as that progress may be, the reality is somewhat grimmer. An estimated 9.7million people need ART, and while 950,000 wereput on ART in 2007, there were 2.7 million new HIVinfections that year. So ART is getting to less than a third of those who need it, and new infectionsoutstrip threefold the increase in treatment access.The scale up has been massive, but is still waybehind what is needed. Universal access to ART isunachievable by 2010 and very unlikely by 2015. 13 If treatment is falling behind need, what about preventing new infections? 75-85% of HIV-positiveadults have been infected through unprotectedintercourse, mostly heterosexual. Recent evidenceshows that sustained, intensive behaviour changeglobal health Steve Fouch reviews progress with three specific diseases MDG 6 - HIV, TB & malaria MDG 6: Specific targets nBy 2015 to have halted, and begun to reverse, the spread of HIV/AIDS nBy 2010 to achieve universal access totreatment for HIV/AIDS for all who need it nBy 2015 to halve the prevalence of TB globally nBy 2015 to have halted, and begun to reverse,the incidence of malariaPhoto: PA Photossummer 09 triple helix 15programmes promoting increased use of condoms, delayed sexual initiation, and fewer sexual partnersare reducing HIV incidence. 14 In 2007 international funding for such programmes in low and middle-income countriesreached $10 billion - a tenfold increase in less thana decade; again, an impressive achievement. Yet thissum still falls short of the $18 billion in aid thatUNAIDS estimates is required annually for AIDSprevention. Overall, the rate of new infections is declining only slowly, and shows no sign of going into reverse by 2015. 15 Malaria The picture is not really any better when it comes to malaria, which causes 250 million cases of fever ayear, and claims the lives of about a million people.In sub-Saharan Africa it is the largest infectiouscause of death for children. 16One of the most effective ways to prevent infection is to sleep under an insecticide-treated bed net, and a majorprevention initiative has been distributing thesenets (which cost ~\u00a35 each) to all those in at-risk areas. 17 A huge amount has been achieved in this one simple initiative. By 2007, 95 million nets had beendistributed - 65 million in three years. All sub-Saharan African countries with endemic malariahave seen bed net distribution increase. Howeverthis is still below target, and while the UN SecretaryGeneral has urged this initiative to continue so that universal coverage is reached by 2010, it looks questionable whether this is still achievable.Nevertheless, universal bed net coverage may be achieved by 2015. Treatment has seen less progress, however. Although treatment among febrile children ismoderately high across sub-Saharan Africa, fewcountries have expanded coverage since 2000, andmost patients often receive less effective medicines.In 22 sub-Saharan African countries (accounting fornearly half the region's population) the proportionof children with a fever who received anti-malarialmedicines dropped from 41% in 2000 to 34% in 2005. Furthermore, artemisinin-based combination therapies, regarded as the most effective, are notonly not being used as widely as they should, butrecent evidence from Cambodia suggests that themalaria parasite is developing resistance to the drug.There is a very real risk that effective treatmentoptions for malaria will decrease over the next few years. 18 Tuberculosis While HIV and malaria targets look at best likely tobe met only partially, the picture for TB is possiblyeven worse. Figures from 2008 show that worldwidetwo billion people are infected with TB! 14.4 millionhave active TB infections; there are 9.2 million newcases each year, and two million deaths. Around one million new cases each year are due to HIV co-infection, and 300,000 people each year areinfected with multi-drug resistant strains. 19 The target of reducing TB prevalence and mortality by 2015 is not going to be met, especiallyin Africa and the former Soviet Union, where TB is a growing public health problem. 20There is some good news, however. Where they are in place,Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS)programmes are achieving an 85% success rate incure and prevention of transmission. There are 4.6million people on DOTS worldwide, but this is still only a fraction of the 14.4 million in need of treatment. 21 Conclusion MDG 6 is off target in every area. The scale of health problems in the developing world isoutweighing the considerable efforts and fundingthat have been put in so far, and in the currentclimate these will be hard to sustain both politically and economically. The irony is that the extra billions in funding needed to achieve these targets are but a drop inthe ocean compared to the trillions in economicstimulus packages and bailouts recently committedby developed world governments. Perhaps the real issue is not the scale of the problem, but thecommitment our governments, and we to whomthey are accountable, have towards tackling theglobal health crisis? Yet at the local level and on smaller scales, some amazing work is being done, much of it byChristians. As much as 60% of the healthcare inmany parts of sub-Saharan Africa is coming fromchurches and Christian hospitals, especially inresponse to HIV and AIDS, 22and in other parts of the developing world Christian health initiatives are a smaller but still significant response. 23 While swine flu and the credit crunch make the headlines,24we should not be forgetting these major public health challenges that affect the lives of tensof millions - health challenges with effectivesolutions. We should be holding our governmentsaccountable for the aid they give, while supportingthose working on the front line. 25 Steve Fouch is CMF Head of Allied Professions Ministries and works with the InternationalDepartmentglobal health 1.

Traditional interpretations ofExodus 21:22-25 are reviewed and the author concludes thepassage refers to harm to bothmother and child. More importantly, he emphasises how in the face of a dramatic rise in abortion numbers, contemporary theologians now draw attention to a wealth of other relevantScriptures. What does the Bible say about termination of pregnancy? Those in favour of a legal rightto elective termination often argue that 'the Bible is silent on the subject ofabortion'. 1'The word \"abortion\" does not appear in any translation of the Bible!'2Nevertheless, it is a mistake to suppose that where the Scriptures arenot explicit on a question they have nothing to say.The Scriptures almost always have more to say on a question than we realise. A controversial passage In relation to abortion, perhaps the single mostdiscussed Bible passage has been Exodus 21:22-25.The English Standard Version provides a good literal translation: When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her children come out [ yatsa ], but there is no harm [ason], the one who hit her shall surely be fined, as the woman's husband shall impose on him, and heshall pay as the judges determine. But if there is harm,then you shall pay life for life, eye for eye, tooth fortooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. This passage contains a key ambiguity that becomes apparent if we ask the questions: 'no harm'to whom? Is the punishment of 'life for life' imposedonly for harm to the woman? Or is it also imposedfor harm to her children? Harm only to the woman? The Revised Standard Version translates 'her childrencome out' with the phrase 'there is a miscarriage'. Thisimplies that the 'harm' refers only to the woman. Thisis explicit in the New Jerusalem Bible: 'she suffers a miscarriage but no further harm is done'. On thisinterpretation the death of the unborn child merits a 'fine' but further harm to the mother merits 'life for life'. In favour of this interpretation is the witness of Josephus in the first century AD: He that kicks a woman with child, so that the woman miscarry, let him pay a fine in money... as havingdiminished the multitude by the destruction of what wasin her womb...but if she die of the stroke, let him also beput to death. 3 The same interpretation is evident in the Talmud and has become authoritative in Orthodox Judaism.It is because of this interpretation of Exodus 21 thateven conservative Orthodox Jews say that in Jewishlaw the unborn child does not have the status of aperson. Where abortion is a sin, it is not the sin of homicide. Unsurprisingly, this interpretation is much quoted by modern advocates of 'reproductive choice'. While many Jewish and Christian scholars find this interpretation persuasive, others point to difficulties. The word yatsa does not usually mean miscarriage. It is an ordinary word for giving birth(Genesis 25:26, 38:28; Job 3:11, 10:18; Jeremiah 1:5,20:18). The more specific word for miscarriage ( shokol) is not used in this passage. More fundamentally, thetext does not state explicitly that the 'harm' refersonly to harm to the woman, so on this key point the interpretation goes beyond the text. Harm only to the 'formed' foetus? A second ancient interpretation of this passageallows that 'harm' applies to the unborn child, butonly after this child is 'formed'. The most influentialethics David Albert Jones revisits a controversialpassage EXODUS 21 and abortionsummer 09 triple helix 17Greek translation of the Old Testament, the Septuagint, makes a distinction not between harmto the unborn child (a fine) and the woman (life forlife) but between harm to the unformed embryo (a fine) and the formed foetus (life for life). TheJewish philosopher Philo, an older contemporary of Josephus, follows this interpretation: If the child within her is still unfashioned and unformed, he shall be punished by a fine...But if thechild had assumed a distinct shape in all its parts,having received all its proper and distinctive qualities, he shall die. 4 How did the Septuagint come to translate the Hebrew word ason ('harm') by the Greek word exeikonismenon ('fully formed')? Many scholars have pointed to the influence of Greek philosophicalideas. For Aristotle, an unformed embryo was notyet a human being. If the foetus is 'fully formed'then miscarriage would harm a human being.However, if it is unformed then it is not yet humanand so there is no serious harm. This seems to be the underlying idea. The Greek translation was popular among Christians and shaped the first Latin translation.This encouraged Christians to make a moraldistinction between the 'unformed' embryo and the'formed' foetus, a distinction that was sometimesidentified with 'ensoulment'. In recent times theSeptuagint translation of this passage has beenquoted by Christians arguing in favour of a 'gradualist' view of the status of the embryo. 5,6 Nevertheless, this interpretation clearly goes beyondthe text, creating a moral distinction that has nobasis in the Scriptures themselves. It should also benoted that this interpretation implies the passagepays no attention to the woman; the focus is onlythe foetus and its stage of development. Harm to mother or children? Ancient and medieval interpretations of this passage tended to follow either the Talmud or theSeptuagint. However, at the time of the Reformationthere was a renewed spirit of reading the words ofScripture without the lens of received traditionalinterpretation. It was in this context that Calvindecisively rejected both exclusive focus on thewoman and exclusive focus on the stage of development of the foetus: This passage at first sight is ambiguous, for if the word death [ie harm, ason] only applies to the pregnantwoman, it would not have been a capital crime to put anend to the foetus, which would be a great absurdity; forthe foetus, though enclosed in the womb of its mother, is already a human being. 7 Calvin's interpretation applies harm to mother or children. This implies that the children might'come out' and yet might not be seriously harmed.The delivery might not be a miscarriage. In thisinterpretation a fine would be imposed because of the assault on a pregnant woman and the danger it posed, even though it caused no serious or lasting harm. In contrast, if mother or children were harmed the penalty would be 'life for life, eye for eye, etc'.Calvin's interpretation has influenced the NewInternational Version and other modern versionsthat translate 'her children come out' as 'she givesbirth prematurely'. Faced with these three traditions of interpretation, the Christian should not start by asking whichinterpretation would be most convenient. Rather,we should ask who God intends to protect in thispassage. The answer to this question should beinformed by our reading of other scripturalpassages. A wealth of other passages Until recent times, when Christians have reflectedabout the status of the unborn child they have rarelythought far beyond this one passage of Scripture, orthey have preferred their moral intuition and naturalreason to any use of Scripture. The wealth of therest of the Scriptures has gone largely untapped. It was only in the late twentieth century, in the face of a dramatic rise in abortion, that Christiansbegan to turn to a much wider range of texts toinform their beliefs. Theologians now appeal not only to Exodus and the Commandments, but also, for example, to themany passages in the Scriptures which refer to Godforming, naming and calling the child in the womb(eg Job 10:8-12; Psalm 139:13-16; Isaiah 44:1-2,49:1-5; Jeremiah 1:5; Galatians 1:15). The infancy narratives, especially the slaughtering of the innocents by Herod (Matthew 2:16-18), thepresence of Jesus in the womb of Mary, 8and the leaping of John the Baptist in the womb of Elizabeth(Luke 1:41-44) are also now invoked in the critiqueof the practice of abortion. Theologians also relate abortion to the identification of Christ with 'the least' in society(Matthew 25:40) and to the parable of the GoodSamaritan (Luke 10:29-37). Dare we say that theunborn child is not our neighbour? 9 Not all of these other texts are equally relevant. Nevertheless, the broadening of the number andscope of texts discussed in relation to abortion isundoubtedly a positive thing. It encourages us toask not simply what the Jewish law says aboutabortion, but where we see Christ in this situation - which is surely both in the mother and in herchildren.

Rather,we should ask whoGod intends toprotect in thispassagethe wider horizon 'I've always wanted to work abroad but...' is a phrase I often hear from junior doctors who have moved from thecarefree days of student electives into the harsh realities ofpostgraduate training and the Modernising Medical Careers system. Many have the impression that time out to work in developing countries is not an option while in training, and mayjeopardise their career. However,several government reports haverecognised the benefits of inter-national experience, 1,2not just for the individual doctor and thosewith whom they work abroad,but also for the NHS which isenriched by the skills they bringback. The reports recommend that health professionals should beallowed to interrupt theirtraining to work abroad, and thateducators and employers shouldmake it possible for them to doso. The BMA's new handbook,Broadening your horizons , 3is a useful guide to the different waysof taking time out of training oremployment. One such option isthe OOPE - Out Of ProgrammeExperience. Beckles, orthopaedic SpR, is currently at the Beit Trust Cure International Hospital in Malawi. She writes: You can go! Yes, You! If you had spoken to me five years ago, there was no way I could see myself living in Africa for over a year. I planned to be a serious surgeon, you know. Then I met some amazingly inspiringsurgeons who work in Malawi, serving patients and training doctors.Although there are committed local health care professionals here, theyare few in number - coming to support and encourage them has taughtme so much about what is important in life. Yes, it took a bit of planningand there were administrative obstacles to overcome but I tell you what- there is absolutely nothing like being in the place where God wantsyou and then looking back at the ways in which he's equipped you and blessed you. It is possible to come at any stage of training. I have met some who have come as medical students, others who have come after foundation years(and flown back to get two offers of training programmes), and manyregistrars and consultants from all around the world. The opportunities areendless as there is a lack of skilled personnel at all levels in this part ofthe world. I've had brilliant trainers in the UK but the truth is that herein Malawi I have had training which is second to none - a delicatebalance of empowerment and supervision. I have opportunities to teachon courses, to do research, and to operate on far more cases than in theUK. I've also learnt how to play tennis! I have never been so healthy financially, physically and spiritually in my working life. Yes, I miss Japanese food and H\u00e4agen-Dazs, and grannies with fractured necks of femur, and power tools - hand drilling is completelyoverrated! And, obviously I miss my family and friends back in the UK but God's provision of a wider adopted family and friends herecontinues to be so astounding that I'm staying an extra three months! Ophthalmic OOPE in Sudan Matt Hawker, ophthalmologySpR in Norwich, spent twomonths in Sudan with his youngfamily as part of his hospital'slink programme with GeziraHospital. Some of the time wascounted as study leave, the restas OOPE. He had done a oneweek visit in 2007, when a threeyear plan to set up a glaucomaservice was initiated. He returnedthis year to help implement thisplan, building on the relation-ships he had already made: It was an amazing opportunity to use the knowledge and skills I havegained through my training here.There was masses to do - I sawhundreds of people in clinic andoperated on patients aged fourmonths to 70 years. I gave tutorialstwice a week - people were so keento learn. As a family we experiencedwhat life is like for the majority ofthe world. It was good, it was hard,there were a few tears, but overall it was great fun. Hospital link Hospital links are a great way for health professionals here tocontribute to services in developing countries. Lasting relationshipsdevelop as repeated visits are made in both directions and there areopportunities for training and service in different fields. Why notconsider forming a link at your hospital?

The Decalogue is a list of TenCommandments not a bill of Human Rights. In the charity legislation of the Bible, for instance, it is the rich man who iscommanded to support the poor, not the poor man who has theright to demand support from the rich.' ( BMJ 2009; 338:b2138) Another 'medical classic' Another review same series looks at John Wesley's 17 47Primitive Physic: Or, an Easy and Natural Method of Curing mostDiseases. Wesley's uncle was a physician, and his Puritan greatgrandfather had studied theology and medicine at Oxford. Wesley's'20 rules for a healthy life' attracted criticism not from the medicalprofession but from 'fellow divines, who believed that somediseases punishment for sin'. (BMJ 2009;338:b908) Liberating the laity Christian history also provides a metaphor for considering theeffect of the information revolution on doctor-patient relation-ships. Martin Luther and the Reformation are credited withempowering the laity through translations from Latin and puttingBibles into more people's hands, thus threatening the paternalisticpower of the Catholic church in Europe; so the availability ofmedical information through the internet has 'brought the canonof medical knowledge...into the hands and homes of ordinarypeople'. (BMJ 2009; 338:b1080) Obama, abortion, and conscience The US President is considering rescinding protections the Bushadministration adopted to enforce three federal conscience laws. A poll in March showed 87% of 800 adults believed it important to 'make sure that healthcare professionals in America are notforced to participate in procedures and practices to which theyhave moral objections'. President Obama has already restored US funding for the UN Population Fund with its controversialinvolvement in the Chinese forced abortion programme, andoverturned the US ban on funding the pro-choice groups theInternational Planned Parenthood Federation and the Center for Reproductive Rights.

(BMA News 2009; 30 May:3) Discrimination against Christians A recent Sunday Telegraph poll revealed that 50% of British Christians had suffered some sort of persecution for their faith;44% said they had been mocked by friends, neighbours orcolleagues; 20% said they had faced opposition at work; and 19% said they had been 'ignored' or 'excluded' because oftheir beliefs. Anecdotal evidence suggests these problems may be particularly prevalent in the National Health Service.

(MORI and the Daily Telegraph, quoted in Quadrant, May 2009 p6) Fearing the process of dying Yet another poll, by public theology think tank Theos, suggeststhat half the population have the Woody Allen approach: 'I'm notafraid of dying; I just don't want to be there when it happens'. In apoll of over 1,000 adults, 20% admitted they feared both the waythey will die and death itself. 30% feared the way they will die butnot death itself; while 25% fear neither death nor the way theywill die. The highest proportion fearing both was among 18-24 year olds (26%). 42% of over-65s believed their religious faithhelps them deal with the death of a loved one and prepare fortheir own death, compared with only 23% of the 18-24s.(www.theosthinktank.co.uk) So we do need chaplains With secularists campaigning that chaplains should be paid for by the church and not out of NHS budgets, these figures show the significance of spiritual aspects of health care. Further stronganecdotal support is provided by the death of Adrian, a 25 yearold journalist, from leukaemia. Adrian's blog recorded his appreciation of the chaplain's listening; the chaplain writes'Adrian's case highlights the fact that asking whether a patient is religious or not is an inappropriate way to discern whetherchaplaincy support would be of benefit to them'.

The first sectionaddresses 'What is self harm andhow does it develop?' The authorsexplain the role of emotions andexplain why some people dealwith intense emotions by selfharming. They emphasise that thefirst step towards recovery for theperson who self harms is actuallyto want to be helped. They recommend that the person should consult the GP and constructively discuss topicswhich can usefully be raised bythe patient with the GP at thisconsultation. The second sectionof the book is called 'Recoveringfrom self harm'. The authorsexplain the unhelpful reactions tostrong emotions such as anger,frustration, anxiety, and sadness,and how these emotions can bemanaged effectively. The thirdsection is 'For those caring forsufferers', where the importanceof carers and the commonmistakes they may make arediscussed. This is a book aimed at patients who self harm and their carers.There is minimal reference to thebroader medical literature, andthere is no discussion of aChristian perspective on the issueof self harm, but this book shouldprove useful for both patients andtheir carers.

Veronica Zundel has long experience of depression andwrites from a Christianperspective. Crying for the Light is 'not a self-help book, a medicaltextbook or a complete guide to depression'. Rather it is acollection of Bible texts andparaphrases, personal commentsand reflections, poems andprayers, information and advice. Zundel's frankness about her own experience will undoubtedlyconnect with some, helping themto feel less alone. Mindful of thosewith impaired concentration, sheoffers bite-sized readings andreflections. She gives importantinformation about depression anddebunks some myths. Severalpoems are thought-provoking. However, the unsystematic use of paraphrased Scripture and ofthe Apocrypha is rather superficialat times, while some potentiallymisleading advice lacks biblicalbalance - for example, avoidchurch if you find it unhelpful.

Neil Menon is a GP programme director in NorthamptonThe author writes from two decades'experience responding to the AIDS crisis in his nativeZambia, in Botswana, and mostrecently in the UK. During thattime, as well as caring for andtreating affected individuals and families, he has also beenactively developing a strategy foreducating whole communities torespond to HIV using a mixtureof images (mostly culled fromTALC's educational slideslibrary), stories, and Africanproverbs. The aims of the strategy are to equip communities to protect themselves against HIV,to tackle stigma, and to care effectively and compassionatelyfor those affected. Tacklingprejudice, denial, ignorance andstigma head on, this approachhas inevitably brought him intoconflict with community leadersand others. Yet in the long run,the impact has been positive,with evidence of increasedhealth-seeking behaviour,including access to voluntarytesting and counselling services,by members of local commun-ities who have been involvedwith this educational approach. The book is part history of the response to HIV in Zambia andBotswana, part autobiography,part a manual for theAIDUcation approach, and partan overview of the AIDSpandemic in southern Africatoday. It makes interestingreading, although is hamperedwithout the pictures Dr Mparauses in his AIDUcationprogrammes. Nevertheless, for those seeking an effectiveeducational strategy for HIVprevention, this book is a useful addition to the growing literature. Steve Fouch is CMF Head of Allied Professions Ministries summer 09 triple helix 21letters Friend of 'sinners'? Dewi Hughes's consideration of the theology of harm reduction strategies (Easter 2009:14-15) has stimulated responses from both sides of thedebate. Hilary Cooling , who works in sexual health in Bristol, writes: Thank you for publishing Dewi Hughes's thoughtfularticle on harm reduction strategies. His theological viewis refreshingly practical and much needed, addressing useful examples from my field of work: sexual health. It sometimesfeels there is no area of medicine more likely to call forth criticismfrom Christians than sexual health (and its earlier incarnations:GU medicine, family planning, etc). Adolescent sexual activity is increasing worldwide in most societies. Limiting the damagecaused by unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted infectionsis worthwhile, and NHS campaigns do invite young people toconsider whether they are ready to be having sex, and if they could say 'no' (see eg www.ruthinking.co.uk). Jesus spent much of his time associating with the weak and vulnerable, and rather than judging them, met these people attheir point of need with wisdom and compassion. My prayer is for God to enable me to treat people with respect and care, to beaware of spiritual needs, and to know when and how to challengeunhealthy choices and behaviour and refer on where necessary,including when there are concerns about child protection. Rachael Pickering is a police surgeon in North Yorkshire: Congratulations to Triple Helix and to Dewi Hughes. The other side of the harm reduction debate has been given prominence at the CMF National Conference and subsequently in print,1so it was encouraging to read a pro-harm reduction piece. Dewi got to the heart of the matter: 'Is it possible tocall ourselves the friend of a drug addict...while refusing to counte-nance any harm reduction strategy?' I agree that the answer is 'No!' I haven't yet swopped my silver Fishy Badge for a rubber WWJD bracelet but actually it would be better because I often forget to ask,'What would Jesus, the Friend of \"Sinners\", 2want us to do with this patient?' He would surely tell us to be true friends, albeit profess- ional ones: to listen, and offer support and advice; to stick by ourpatients in spite of the fact we don't agree with their lifestylechoices; and, while not doing anything designed to hurt them, to help our patients get out of their tricky situations. Regardless of what national statistics may (or may not) say, I have seen that, deployed in the right way, harm reduction techniques can be truly life-saving. Patients and their families can and do gradually get out of their 'dark corners' and walk into brighter, safer places in the world. What the harm reduction machine needs is an influx - rather than an exodus - of Christian practitioners. It is both interesting and sadthat most of its critics work outside the specialties where it is mostneeded and deployed. We fear most what we do not know orunderstand. To remedy this, perhaps those with doubts could spend a week's study leave shadowing CMF members working in these hard places? Newcastle consultant paediatrician Chris Richards began this debate. He maintains that 'harm reduction' is really harm promotion: Dewi Hughes offered a biblical defence of harm reductionstrategies, which I had rejected in the 2003 Rendle ShortLecture. I take issue with his definition and the biblical basis of his conclusions. First, he did not critique these strategies as I defined them - 'policies or activities which attempt to soften theconsequences of future sinful behaviour'. Such strategies must bedistinguished from a) preventative medicine, attempting to reducefuture harm through legitimate interventions; and b) medical care for patients suffering because of their own past sins. He, nevertheless, proposes that doctors can sometimes legitimately be a 'friend to sinners' through harm reductionprogrammes. We can only follow in Jesus' footsteps if we walk as he did in humble obedience to his Father's will. 1Jesus never promoted sin when he befriended prostitutes and outcasts but on the contrary told them to 'sin no more'. 2,3God's law enables us to distinguish approaches that heal from those that harm. We cannot do good by encouraging wrong. Dewi implies that if we refuse harm reduction, we are responsible for the moral decision of our patients if they go ahead and suffer theconsequences. However, it is not us making the decision, but them.The real situation is quite the opposite - we would be wrong to aidand abet their sinful action. He seems to view preservation of life asthe ultimate ethic; our supreme responsibility is to honour Godthrough obedience to his commands. Medical studies affirm the biblical sanction. There is much evidence that condom provision to the unmarried, needle exchanges 4and methadone replacement5to drug abusers have each failed to produce the expected benefits, but rather made matters worse. Why do harmreduction strategies actually promote harm? First, they attempt toreduce the effects of sin, thus making sinning more attractive, soencouraging further sin and suffering as a consequence. Since the'safe sex' message, sexual activity has risen in teenagers, partlybecause they think they can sin safely. This has in turn led to a rapid rise in STIs and abortions. Secondly, health professionals resign themselves to sinful action and so stop trying to change sinful behaviour. Educationprogrammes promoting 'safe sex' rarely include any substantialchallenge to consider abstaining from sexual activity outsidemarriage. Thirdly, trusted state-employed professionals affirmsinful behaviour and give official legitimacy to sinful actions. Dewi states most doctors cannot warn patients not to sin. Most doctors would warn patients about alcohol excess; it is society'smoral sensibilities that deter us regarding sexual immorality. Such warning is more likely to cause offence - for this reason weneed wisdom in doing it. We may have to be content with thepowerful witness which ensues from our refusal to take part insuch programmes, but surely we must 'fear God rather than man' as we refrain from promoting sin. references 1.

Reviewing 60 years of CMF, hewonders why more Christian doctors don't join? It was 1976. I' d been a Christian four years, was doing my house surgeon job in the sticks, and a consultant physician there was a CMFmember. He discovered I was a Christian (I don't remember how),found out I wasn't a member, and suggested I join. He handed me a form the next day. I wasn't working directly for him, so contacts were few and far between and it was easy to do nothing. It's another story for anotherday, but I became an SHO (and later a registrar) on his firm. He askedme again about CMF. I did nothing. He gave me another joining form.I still did nothing. He took me in his rather nice Rover to a CMFmeeting. Another joining form appeared the next day, and I supposein the end it was the parable of the persistent widow and the judge(Luke 18:1-8). I suppose I also thought, well, I will need a reference in a year or so - and I joined. I've just checked the date on the CMF database here; it is recorded as 1 April 1977! I started going to more local meetings; a conference or two; was asked to join the Junior Doctors' Committee; got seconded to theMedical Study Group; and the rest as they say is history. I joined thestaff on 1 April 1989, became General Secretary in 1990, and stayeduntil the end of the millennium. Seven years and some globetrottinglater, I came back. So, what's my point? As Andrew Brown challenges us, there are many Christian doctors out there who could be members but aren't.(We did a little research in the mid-1990s and concluded that for everyChristian doctor who was a member there were at least two andprobably three who could be members but weren't.) We need each other. I think every Christian doctor should join CMF - well, he would say that, wouldn't he? But we join organisations forone or both of two reasons: what's in it for me? And is it a worthwhileministry that I should support? I think CMF scores on both counts. In the autumn we're having a recruitment blitz - we'll send you a DVD to introduce the Fellowship to colleagues and to your churches,and another copy of that attractive new joining form. And it's easynow to join online. Back in the 1970s, my boss persisted. Y ou mustknow somebody who could rejoin or who hasn't joined yet...
