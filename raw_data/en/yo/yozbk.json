Evaluating hormones via testing plays an important role in this process. Different testing modalities can serve different roles toward the goal of hormone balance. Measuring tissue levels in saliva is essential for understanding physiology and how it plays into a patient's symptom picture. For a deeper understanding of hormone metabolism and how it impacts breast health, the metabolism and excretion of hormones measured in urine should also be considered. Elevated endogenous levels of estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) have been implicated as risk factors in breast cancer. It is well established that the metabolites of E1 and E2 can exert proliferative effects in breast tissue. This is due to the way in which these hormones are metabolized as well as the activity of the metabolite intermediates. The liver is responsible for most of this metabolism first through phase I. During phase I metabolism, E1 and E2 are metabolized to the 16-OH, respectively. Each of these metabolites carries known risk as they relate to breast health; 2-OH is generally considered the safer metabolite, while 4-OH is considered to be the most carcinogenic, followed by 16-OH E1, which has also been shown to have a negative impact on breast tissue health. It is well established that having a relative increase of 2-OH metabolites compared to 4-OH metabolites is favorable. For this reason, increasing 2-OH metabolism via CYP1A1 is a favorable treatment strategy. Research has found these natural products can boost CYP1A1. \u00b7 DIM (diindolylmethane) - phytonutrient found in cruciferous vegetables \u00b7 I3C (requires stomach acid to convert to DIM) \u00b7 Coffee \u00b7 Resveratrol \u00b7 Andrographolide, from the Andrographis paniculata plant \u00b7 Astaxanthin (antioxidant found in shrimp and some algae) \u00b7 Fish oil and garlic oil \u00b7 Green and black tea \u00b7 Hops Phase I metabolism in and of itself can generate free radicals. Because of this, the following antioxidants are a consideration to help further reduce additional harm to the tissues: \u00b7 Vitamins A, C, E \u00b7 Carotenoids \u00b7 Selenium \u00b7 Copper \u00b7 Zinc \u00b7 Manganese \u00b7 CoQ10 \u00b7 Alpha lipoic acid \u00b7 Thiols (garlic, cruciferous \u00b7 Silymarin \u00b7 Oligomeric proanthocyanins \u00b7 Glutathione \u00b7 Melatonin Phase II metabolism involves methylation of phase I metabolites into more water-soluble versions that can be excreted and for the most part rendered inactive, via the COMT enzyme. This is an extremely important step. If 4-OH metabolites are not inactivated, they have the potential to form quinones and or semiquinones, which are highly carcinogenic and genotoxic, capable of inducing and potentiating breast cancer. Quinones and semiquinones can also increase the risk of hormone responsive breast cancer. To decrease this risk, it is critical to optimize the function of COMT. The following have been shown to increase COMT: \u00b7 Nutrient cofactors: cruciferous vegetables, soy foods, resveratrol, citrus food, teas For those who have lower COMT activity and thus greater potential for quinone activity, two supplements may offer some additional protection: Resveratrol \u00b7 Can reduce catechol estrogen semiquinones quinone reductase \u00b7 Modulates CYP1B1, thereby reducing its activity and minimizing the potential for the formation of 4-OH metabolites NAC \u00b7 Can reduce estrogen semiquinones back to catechol estrogens \u00b7 Primary effect is to react with quinones to form conjugates preventing the formation of estrogen-DNA adducts. Doctor's Data now offers the [Hormone and Urinary Metabolites Assessment Profile (HuMAP)](https://doctorsdata.com/humap) which directly measures metabolite levels, offering providers a tool for a targeted approach for breast health risk reduction.
