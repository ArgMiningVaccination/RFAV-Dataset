[Unlike](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/preparing/yellow-fever-vaccine-malaria-prevention-by-country) other diseases, exposure to malaria parasites [does not](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/vaccine.html) confer lifelong protection and [acquired immunity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4075043/) only partially protects people against future malaria disease. Malaria vaccines have been approved for use in Africa and are reported to be [effective](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-022-00534-5#Sec8) at preventing disease. On October 6, 2021, the World Health Organization [(WHO](https://www.who.int/initiatives/malaria-vaccine-implementation-programme#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20recommends,falciparum%20malaria%20transmission.)) recommended the Mosquirix (RTS,S/AS01) malaria vaccine, and the [R21/Matrix-M](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/r21-matrix-m-malaria-vaccine) vaccine was approved in [Nigeria](https://twitter.com/NigeriasToday/status/1647973110442864644) and [Ghana](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-04-13-r21matrix-m-malaria-vaccine-developed-university-oxford-receives-regulatory) in 2023.
