Revolutions in biotechnology and information technology have produced enormous amounts of biomedical data.Processing and analysis of these data are accelerating theexpansion of our knowledge of biological systems. Theseadvances are changing the way biomedical research, develop-ment, and applications are done. Clinical data complementthe basic biology data, enabling detailed descriptions andmodeling of various healthy and diseased states, diseaseprogression, and the responses to therapies. The availabilityof data representing various biological states, processes, andtheir time dependencies enables the study of biologicalsystems at various levels of organization, from molecule towhole organism, and even at population levels. Multiplesources of data support a rapidly growing body of biomedicalknowledge; however, our ability to analyze and interpretthese data lags far behind data generation and storagecapacity. Computational models are increasingly used to help interpret biomedical data produced by high-throughput genomics, proteomics, and immunomics projects [ 1-3]. Advanced applications of computer models that enablethe simulation of biological processes are used to gener-ate hypotheses and plan experiments [ 4-7]. Appropriately interfaced with biomedical databases, computational modelsenable rapid access to higher-level knowledge and its sharingthrough data mining and knowledge discovery approaches. In this special issue, we take an interest in the inves- tigation of the physiology and pathology of the immuneresponses, particularly the cellular and molecular processes. The paper contributed by R. Carvalho et al. presents an approach in which a computational model representsthe interaction of mycobacterium infection with the innateimmune system in zebrash. They use the Petri Net for- malism to model interaction between key host elementsinvolved in granuloma formation and infection dissemi-nation, dening a qualitative model for the understandingand description of causal relations within this dynamicprocess. Their systems in biology framework incorporatesmathematical modeling to generate and test hypotheses, toperform virtual experiments, and to make experimentallyveriable predictions. This work demonstrates the use ofmathematical models that support the study of mechanismsof tuberculosis infection. The immune system is able to respond more vigorously to the secondary contact with a given antigen than to thepriming contact. Vaccination protocols generally include atleast two doses, in order to obtain high antibody titers. Inparticular, studies performed in transgenic mouse modelsof Alzheimer's disease have demonstrated that antibodies against beta-amyloid are able to reduce plaques and improve cognition. In mouse models as well as in clinical trialsin Alzheimer's disease patients, induction of high titers ofanti-beta-amyloid antibodies correlates with the therapeuticecacy of vaccination. F. Castiglione et al. have analyzed relations between the time elapsed from the rst dose(priming) and the second dose (boost) on the antibody titers,coupling in vivo experiments with computer simulations to asses the e ect of delaying the second injection. A major challenge in immunology is the translation of data into knowledge given the inherent complexity anddynamics of human physiology. The physiology and engi-neering communities have rich histories in applying compu-tational approaches to translate data obtained from complex2 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine systems into knowledge of system behavior. J. Klinke II and Q. Wang review how two related engineering concepts,specically prototyping and \"tness for use,\" can be appliedto overcome the pressing challenge in translating data intohigher-level knowledge of basic immunology for use inpractical applications, such as improvement of therapies. These concepts are illustrated using two immunology-related examples: behavior of beta cell mass at the onset of type 1diabetes and the dynamics of dendritic cells in the lung. M. Pennisi presents a mathematical model developed to reproduce the immune response entitled with the combinedadministration of activated OT1 cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs) and AntiCD137 against OV A mousemodels exposed to a specic immunotherapy strategy. In thispaper, two compartments have been modeled: the injectionpoint compartment where the treatment is administeredand the skin compartment where melanoma tumor cellsproliferate. The outcomes of the mathematical model arein good agreement with the in vivo results. In particular the sensitivity analysis highlighted the key role of OT1CTLs and suggests that a possible reduction of the numberof injected antibodies should not a ect substantially the treatment e cacy. Bacterial infections can be acute or chronic. The chronic bacterial infections are characterized by a large bacterial loador by an infection where bacteria grow rapidly. In these casesthe immune response is not capable of completely elimi-nating the infection, leading to the formation of a patternknown as microabscess (or abscess). The microabscess is characterized by an area comprising fluids, bacteria, immune cells (mainly neutrophils), and many types of dead cells.This distinct pattern of formation can only be numericallyreproduced and studied by models that capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of the human immune system. B. Pigozzoet al. developed and implemented a computational model tostudy the process of microabscess formation during bacterialinfection. Cats infected with the feline immunodeciency virus (FIV) develop an acquired immunodeciency syndrome(AIDS), similarly to humans infected with HIV . FIV infectioncauses an acute viremia, which decreases after several weeks,and the appearance of a subpopulation of activated CD8 + T cells that we refer to as CD8lowcells. The expansion of this activated T cell population is recognized as an importantmarker of FIV infection and disease. Characterization ofthe CD8 lowpopulation's complex pattern of expansion, including its correlation with other disease markers such asviral load, is likely to increase researchers' understandingof FIV infection and AIDS pathogenesis. B. Ribba et al.propose two simple independent mathematical equationsto analyze the time evolution of CD8 lowpopulation size and of viral load during primary infection in cats with FIV .They developed the models using a population approach and mixed-e ects regression techniques, based on repeated measurements in more than 100 cats infected with FIV . Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have to be suf- ciently long to draw reliable conclusions. However, nomethod exists to prove that a simulation has converged.In the paper contributed by W. Schreiner et al. a method named \"lagged RMSD-analysis\" is proposed to determine ifan MD-simulation has provided a su ciently precise model. The analysis is based on RMSD values between pairs ofcongurations separated by variable time intervals Dt. In summary, these contributions present state of the art modeling of the immune system. The research papers appearing in this special issue will serve as a guide to currentdevelopments and a guide to emerging applications in thefascinating eld of immune system modeling. Ultimately, the utility of computational/mathematical and other quantitative approaches will help provide betterhealthcare. The seven papers in this volume demonstratevarious aspects of modeling of immune processes andpreclinical studies of immune responses.

In the study of complex patterns in biology, mathematical and computational models are emerging as important tools. In addition to experimental approaches, these modeling tools have recently been applied to address open questions regarding host-pathogen interaction dynamics, including the immune response to mycoba cterial infection and tuberculous granuloma formation. We present an approach in which a computationa l model represents the interaction of the Mycobacterium infection with the innate immune system in zebrash at a high level of abstraction. We use the Petri Net formalism to model the interaction between the key host elements involved in granuloma formation and infection dissemination. We dene a qualitative model for the understandingand description of causal relations in this dynamic process. Complex processes involving cell-cell or cell-bacteria communication can be modeled at smaller scales and incorporated hierarchically int o this main model; these are to be included in later elaborations. With the infection mechanism being dened on a higher level, lower-level processes influencing the host-pathogen interaction canbe identied, modeled, and tested both quantitatively and qualit atively. This systems biology framework incorporates modeling to generate and test hypotheses, to perform virtual experiments, and to make experimentally veriable predictions. Thereby it supports the unraveling of the mechanisms of tuberculosis infection. 1. Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually. About one-third of the world'spopulation is infected with the pathogen that causes thisdisease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Most infections are controlled by the host's immune system and remain asymptomatic. However, the Mtb is capable to persist in the host inside granulomas, highly organized structurescharacterized by the presence of di erentiated macrophages, lymphocytes, and other immune cells that contain, butfail to eradicate, the pathogen [ 1,2]. The key to success ofMtb infection lies, at least in part, with the ability of the bacteria to proliferate inside host macrophages despitethe antimicrobial properties of these cells. Some of theinfecting bacteria can survive for extended periods withinmacrophages and in a granuloma, establishing long-terminfections that may resurface later, for example, when thehost's immune system is compromised due to malnutrition, HIV coinfection, or immunosuppressive treatment. Insightin the mechanisms that contribute to this long and complexrelationship between the pathogen and the host is essentialto the understanding of the fundamental aspects of TB[3]. Various animal models are used to mimic Mtb pathogen- esis in humans, each having their specic strengths as wellas limitations. In the recent years, the zebrash has emergedas a valuable addition to the mammalian models. They aregenetically tractable and have an immune system with innateand adaptive branches, very similar to the human immunesystem. A particularly useful property is the transparencyof the embryos, which allows for real-time imaging ofthe interaction between pathogens and host immune cells[4-7].Mycobacterium marinum (Mm) , one of the closest relatives of Mtb, is used to study mycobacterial pathogenesis in zebrash. It causes a systemic tuberculosis-like infection2 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine in zebrash, with the formation of structured granulomas that closely resemble those in human TB. The use of thismodel has recently contributed important insights into thefunction of the granuloma in expansion and disseminationof mycobacteria during the early stages of infection [ 8]. Mathematical and computational modeling provides an important additional avenue for the further exploration of disease dynamics and o ers powerful and complemen- tary tools for the study of the host-pathogen interaction.Gathering and analyzing the information from the animalmodel in a computational modeling process makes it possibleto describe, simulate, analyze and predict the mechanismand interactions behind the infection process in intuitiveand easily analyzable terms. The agent-based model (ABM)is a computational formalism based on rules that governautonomous agents [ 9]; it can be used to model discrete as well as stochastic events in biology. Pappalardo et al.have implemented and simulated models using ABM andcellular automata to study the vaccine administration andimmune response to cancer in mice [ 10-12]. Kirschner et al. have utilized ABM to model and simulate the Mtb disease and the host-pathogen interaction [ 13-15]. They suggest the ABM as an appropriate method for exploring complexspatiotemporal systems such as granuloma formation [ 16]. The Petri net (PN) formalism is another method providinga natural and promising modeling technique useful formodeling metabolic pathways and biological behavior [ 17]. The PN formalism is, typically, very suitable for systemswith a concurrent nature, that is, systems in which processesoccur in parallel. In essence, the PN is a mathematical modeling language based on a directed bipartite graph. The PN formalism has already been successfully applied on casestudies in biology to create, verify, and validate models. Thestochastic activity network (SAN) is an extended Petri netmodel that uses probabilistic time and is in particular usefulfor performance evaluation. Tsavachidou and Liebman [ 18] have used SAN in modeling and quantitative evaluation ofthe biological pathways involved in menopause. They usebiological pathways and experimental data in an accuratequantitative model to simulate and compare to in vivo/in vitro experiments. Peleg et al. [ 19]h a v eu s e dc o l o r e d hierarchical PNs to study the e ects of mutations in tRNA on the protein translation. They dene qualitative modelsof molecular function at di erent levels of granularity. The application domain of tRNA was chosen due the abundantliterature on tRNA molecular structure as well as the diseasesthat relate to abnormal structure. Regarding the process ofmycobacterial infection, the interaction with host-pathogenis complex and much remains unknown and signicance ofspecic immune factors present on the mycobacterial infec-tion process still poorly understood. T o date, mathematicaland computational models applied to mycobacterial infec-tion have been used to explore specic aspects at various bio-logical scales (e.g., intracellular, cell-cell interactions, and cell population dynamics) [ 14-16]. The mycobacterial infection process thus is composed of numerous subprocesses, some ofwhich are mutually dependant, giving rise to a very complexset of interactions. A model describing the process at a higherlevel is missing, and therefore we take the construction ofa model of the infection mechanism at a higher level of granularity as a starting point for our modeling e orts and explorations. The availability of such a model enables toconnect and visualize the whole infection process. This top-down approach allows identifying, modeling, and testing ofthe lower-level processes in both qualitative and quantitative manner. The input for these lower-level processes is obtained from both empirical research and literature data. The zebrash model of Mycobacterium infection, based on Mm infection, has been identied as very useful in the understanding of host-mycobacteria interactions duringearly stages of infection. This model system is used togenerate experimental data that elucidate the pathogenesisas well as to transfer the ndings to the human case.The perspective of analysis from in vivo/in vitro studies requires an integration layer so that experimental data canbe understood in the range of complex interactions that areunderlying the infection process. Therefore, we intend toconstruct such integration layer from an in silico perspective using the Petri net formalism as a modeling method to sim-ulate bacteria-host interactions in early stages of tuberculousgranuloma formation. As indicated, our starting point is toconstruct such a model from a higher level of abstraction.We, therefore, designed a PN by rst identifying the processesin the infection process, that is, phagocytosis of mycobacteriaby macrophages, the migration of infected macrophages todeeper tissue, the growth of mycobacteria within individualmacrophages, and the granuloma formation and matu-ration. These processes were represented in a qualitativecolored Petri net (CPN) using the Snoopy software, a tool for modeling and animating/simulating hierarchical graph- based formalisms. The information analysis on the processeswas obtained from recent literature about the phases involvedin the early response to mycobacterial infection [ 8]a n df r o m interviews with researchers. From the processes as the major design elements, we constructed a qualitative colored Petri net on a level ofabstraction that helps understanding and describing thecausal relations in a dynamic process. In addition to theprocesses, we acknowledged entities such as the zebrash,the macrophage, the granuloma, and the bacteria. As such,the phases of the infection process are addressed whilst,for the moment, time and probability are not considered.In this manner, our model explores the disease on a highlevel of abstraction, modeling the factors that are crucialto visualize the mycobacterial infection process and theearly immune response. Complex processes involving cell-cell or cell-bacteria communication can be modeled in asmall-scale process and incorporated into the model asa hierarchical layer. As intended, the model shows thecause-e ect relations that trigger the infection process. The graphical representation of the CPN communicates that ina manner a biologist can grasp immediately. Now, as themodel incorporates the process of infection, the toolbox of the biologist is extended with an approach that allows to perform \"what-if\" as part of the experimentation whereasat the same time new experimental ndings can be addedto the model in a close collaboration between empirical andmodeling scientists.Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 3 Figure 1: Microscope image of a zebrash larva infected with Mycobacterium marinum by injection used for the study on infection progression and immune system response. Image is obtained with a Leica stereo fluorescence microscope commonly used in zebrash research. Here the microscope image is depictedwith an overlay of a fluorescent channel (red) in which the bacteriaare visualized. The arrows indicate granulomas that have been developed after an induced infection with Mycobacterium marinum. Starting from the abstract model of the global infection process, future extensions, such as submodels representingprocesses on tissue, cellular, and molecular scale, will hier-archically connect as a single model. In close collaborationwith the empirical scientist and using the model, we intend toperform in silico experiments that are otherwise impractical or not feasible in vivo orin vitro , thereby predicting results of new experiments and generate further hypotheses aboutthe immune system response to mycobacterial infection. TheCPN model presented in this paper is the cornerstone of thatprocess. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 , we discuss the pathogenesis of the Mycobacterium infection in Zebrash in more detail and next we introduce the building blocks of the CPN and the software that we haveused to build the model. In Section 3 ,w ep r o v i d eas e r i e so f design considerations to come to an implementation of themodel. Finally in Section 4 , we end with the conclusion and discussion. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. The Zebrash Model of Mycobacterial Pathogenesis. The zebrash is naturally susceptible to infections caused by M. marinum (Mm), genetically closely related to M. tuberculosis (Mtb). The Mm infection shares pathological hallmarks with Mtb infection. Like other pathogenic mycobacteria, Mm causes chronic infection of macrophages resulting in tuberculous granulomas, making it a useful model tostudy mycobacterial pathogenesis [ 20]. Zebrash embryos have functional innate immune cells (macrophages and neutrophils), while their adaptive immune system is not yet functional. The experimental infection of zebrashembryos is initiated by injected bacteria into the bloodcirculation or into tissue. Macrophages that are attracted tothe site of infection take up the mycobacteria by a processcalled phagocytosis. Real-time imaging of infected zebrashembryos has allowed the direct observation of the arrival ofphagocytes at the infection site and their uptake of bacteria.The macrophages are the primary cell type infected withMm; however, also infected neutrophils have been observed [6,8] and were recently shown to play an important role in Mm infection control [ 21]. In Figure 1 ,a n Mm infection in a zebrash is depicted.Inside the macrophage, bacteria can be exposed to bac- tericidal mechanisms and degraded in lysosomes. However,intracellular mycobacteria are predominantly distributedbetween the early and late phagosomal compartments,with some also escaping into the cytoplasm [ 22,23]. Similar to Mtb,Mm escapes from lysosomal degradation and its survival inside macrophages is facilitated through the dynamic modulation of a range of cellular processes.These include inhibition of pathways involved in the fusionof the phagosome with lysosomes, antigen presentation,apoptosis, and the activation of bactericidal responses [ 23- 25]. Mycobacterial interference with the host signaling machinery severely compromises the immune defences, andthe multiplication of mycobacteria inside the macrophageover time causes its death, thereby enabling further spreadingof the infection. Once it has become infected with mycobacteria, the macrophage starts to induce recruitment of uninfectedmacrophages. Studies have established an important role fora mycobacterial virulence factor, the ESX-1 secretion system,in the recruitment of new macrophages to granulomasand the expansion of infected macrophages [ macrophages e ciently nd and phagocytose infected macrophages and bacteria that are released from deadcells, but in this process these macrophages are gettinginfected too. The aggregated macrophages become activated,a transformation reflected by an increase in their size andsubcellular organelles, ru ed cell membranes, and enhanced phagocytic and microbicidal capabilities. A common featureof all Mycobacterium granulomas is the further di erenti- ation of the macrophages into epithelioid cells that have tightly interdigitated cell membranes in zipper-like arrayslinking adjacent cells. Those aggregates grow into organizedstructures that are referred to as granulomas, lumps ofimmune cells that surround the infection [ 23]. Primary granulomas are capable of disseminating infection throughout the body by egression of infectedmacrophages which suggests that granuloma macrophagesconstitute the major mechanism for dissemination of theinfection [ 5]. These granulomas are the hallmark of the tuberculosis disease in both human and animal models. InFigure 2 , a schematic representation is depicted of the early stages of the mycobacterial of the pathogenesis infectionprocess. 2.2. Computational Modeling. Experimental research has generated a tremendous amount of insights into host- pathogen interactions that occur during mycobacterial infec-tions. Mathematical and computational models can o er powerful and complementary methods in support for betterunderstanding the mechanisms behind the infection processin intuitive and easily analyzable terms. Amongst thesemethods, we can refer to modeling approaches such asBrane calculi [ 28],-calculus [ 29], agent-based and petri nets (PNs) [ 30]. These modeling methods can be used to describe, simulate, analyze, andpredict the behavior of biological system by turning whatis known about the biology into equations and/or rules todescribe and ultimately understand the system. Previously,4 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine Macrophage migration to bacterial infection site Phagocytosis Phagolysosomal fusion fails Migration of infected macrophage into tissue and intracellular growth of mycobacteriaRecruitment of uninfected macrophage and aggregationIntracellular bacterial spread in aggregatesGranuloma and infection dissemination Figure 2: Schematic representation of the early stages of the immune respon se to the early stages of the mycobacterial infection process. This gure is an authors' rendition adapted from [ 27]. we proposed a system for modeling, simulating, and visual- izing the Mycobacterium infection and granuloma formation, addressing the basic layout and the modeling challengesfor this approach and evaluating between computationalmethods the Petri net as an appropriate method for themodeling of the infection process [ 31]. The Petri nets provide a formal and clear representation of systems based on their rm mathematical foundation forthe analysis of system properties. The graphical notationof Petri nets allows an easy and intuitive construction ofmodels of biological systems. T o characterize the structure,behavioral properties, and dynamics of a model, there areseveral techniques to add time-dependent and space aspectsas well as data and probabilistic aspects [ 32]. Petri nets have as their underlying structure a directed, nite, bipartitegraph, typically without isolated nodes. The four maincomponents of a general Petri net are as follows [ 33]: (i)places: passive nodes that refer to conditions or local states; (ii) tokens: variable elements that represent current infor- mation on a condition or local state; (iii) transitions: active nodes that describe local state shifts, events, and activities in the system; (iv) directed arcs: connections that specify relationships between transitions and places. Standard PN models are discrete and have no notion of time and as such are very useful for modeling processeswithout time or probability. T o model more complexprocesses, extensions to the standard PN are used; in coloredPetri nets (CPNs), data values are assigned features usingdierent colors as data structure [ 34]; in stochastic Petri nets (SPNs) probabilities are added to the transitions [ 35];other extensions such as hybrid Petri nets (HPNs) and hybrid functional Petri nets (HFPNs) allow for coexistence of bothcontinuous and discrete processes [ 36]. In order to create a flexible, compact, and parameteri- zable model, we decided to use a CPN to model the earlystages of the infection process and granuloma formation.Although standard Petri nets can be used to model partsof our problem, such as reaction processes and biochemicalcomponents, it becomes impractical to represent di erent levels of abstraction, when in addition, other aspects haveto be taken into account such as the physical and spatialorganization of the organism, from the intracellular tothe intercellular level and beyond (molecular, cellular, andtissues). Colored Petri nets allow the description of severalsimilar network structures in a concise and well-dened way,providing a flexible template mechanism for network design-ers. In colored Petri nets, tokens can be distinguished by theircolors. This allows one to discriminate levels (molecules,metabolites, proteins, secondary substances, genes, etc.). Inaddition, the token colors can be used to distinguish betweensubpopulations of a species in di erent locations (cytosol, nucleus, and so on). For these reasons, we have chosen to model the early stages of the Mycobacterium infection process and granuloma formation and dissemination in terms of colored Petri nets. The process consists of phagocytosis of the mycobacteriaby macrophages, migration of infected macrophages, andbacterial in an individual macrophage as well asthe aggregation, granuloma formation, and dissemination ofthe infection. In the following section, we give a denitionof CPN based on [ 34,37]W eu s e Bto denote the Boolean type, containing the elements {false, true}with the standard operations from propositional and we use Type (Vars) todenote a set of types {Type (v)|vVars}of a typed set Vars .Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 5 Denition 1.

(6) In general, a marking mis a function associating with each place pa multiset m(p)o fc o l o r s( t o k e n s )f r o m C(p). Markings are the global states of the colored Petri net. The Petri net semantics describes the behavior of the net, based on a ring rule consisting of a precondition andthe e ect of the occurrence (ring) of a single transition. Whether or not a transition can re depends on the markingof its preceding-places and the arc expression on the inputarcs. A transition is enabled and is allowed to re, if allpreceding-places, are su ciently marked and if the binding of the variables that appear in the arc expressions evaluatesto a multiset of token colors that is present on the corre- sponding input place. The guards of the transition shouldevaluate to true for the giving binding. If a transition hasno preceding-places, it is always enabled. When a transitionoccurs with a given binding, a multiset of colored tokens aretaken from each preceding-place and added to later-places in accordance with the arc expression on the arc leading to those places. Repeatedly ring transitions lead to ring sequencesand determine the state space of the Petri net [ 33]. 2.3. Software and Hardware Platform. Several tools are avail- able to model biological systems using Petri nets, simulatetheir dynamic behavior, and analyze their structure. TheSnoopy software provides an extensible, adaptive, and mul- tiplatform framework to design, animate, and simulate Petri nets [ 38]. Its design facilitates the modular implementation of our CPN model allowing future extensions to be addedthrough hierarchical organization of Petri nets. We have usedthe Snoopy software to implement and animate our net withtwo di erent operating systems (OS): Windows 7 (HP Intel core i7, 4 Gb RAM) and Mac OS 10.6 (MacBook Pro Intelcore i7, 4 Gb RAM). The main di erence between the two platforms is the additional features in the user interface forthe Windows implementation. The CPN model runs withthe same accuracy on both OS versions. This illustrates theplatform independency of the Snoopy software framework. 3. Results We have modeled the role of the innate immune system inthe early stages of a mycobacterial infection. Our approach is to provide a large-scale model that drives the infection behavior. We have used the Snoopy tool, a framework for modeling and animating/simulating hierarchical graph-based formalisms [ 38], in order to create a qualitative colored Petri net representing the relevant phases in the infectionprocess as depicted on Figure 2 . In the following sections, we present the color sets , placesP, transitions T, and the initial markingIpresent in our CPN =(,P,T,A,C,G,E,I). 3.1. Set of Color Sets .We have dened ve simple color sets: position, individual, status, and count and four compound color sets: macrophage, bacteria, proliferation, Granulomacomposed of the basic color sets. They represent empiricalinformation from the infection process: (i) position is an integer value representing the location of a macrophage, bacteria, and/or granuloma; (ii) individual is a string value (mm, mac) used to identify bacteria and macrophages; (iii) status is a Boolean value; it can represent the infection status (healthy/infected) of a macrophage or thesaturation of a proliferation; (iv) count is an integer value representing a threshold for the simulation; (v) macrophage is composed of position, individual, and status colors and represents host macrophageimmune cells;6 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine (vi) bacteria is composed of position and individual colors and represents M.marinum bacteria that will be injected; (vii) proliferation is composed of count, individual, and status colors and represents the amount of infectedaggregated macrophages; (viii) granuloma is composed of position, individual, and count colors and represents granulomas with the amount of macrophages. 3.2. Set of Places P.The set of places of our CPN is dened as Dissemination/bracerightbig.(7) They represent population of cells and multicellular complexes that are part of our model: (i)C(Infection)={Bacteria}:a place with the mycobac- teria that intrude the host; (ii)C(ImmuneSystem) ={Macrophage}:ap l a c ec o n - taining the immune cells (healthy macrophages) that will react to an infection signaling; (iii)C(Phagocytosis) ={Macrophage}:a and C(BactGrowth) ={Proliferation}: places containing information about the bacterial replication withino n em a c r o p h a g ea n di t sm o v e m e n t ; (v)C(DeadMacrophage) ={ Macrophage}and infected aggregatedmacrophages (intracellular flow of the simulation. 3.3. Set of Transitions T.The set of transitions of our model is dened as T=/braceleftbigBacSignaling, MacSignaling, IntracelullarSpread, Spread,t1,t2,t3,t4/bracerightbig.(8) They describe important events that govern the infection process and refer to the molecular interaction, signalingreaction and intracellular changes; they also regulate some thresholds that control the simulation: (i) BacSignaling represents the signaling process when bacteria reach the host; (ii) MacSignaling represents the signaling process of an infected macrophage after its death (recruitment ofhealthy macrophages); (iii) IntracelullarSpread represents bacterial repli- cation among the aggregated macrophage in thegranuloma; (iv) infection; (v) t1, t2, t3 ,and t4 represent the control thresholds of the simulation. 3.4. Initial Marking I.The initial marking in our model determines for each place the number and type of coloredtokens initially present in the places. We have the conditionmarkings that are xed and used to control the process andthe example markings which are used in our example andcan be modied without changing the workflow. They aredened as follows. Condition markings: (i)I(Checkpoint) =1/prime(true): initialized for checking if the macrophagereaches its limits; (ii)I(RecruitmentCount) =1/prime(0): initialized =1/prime(1, mm, true): initialized inside the macrophage; (iv)I(Dissemination) =1/prime(0): initialized to keep count of the dissemination of the granuloma; (v)I(Condition) =1/prime(true): initialized to enable one infected macrophage and start thesignaling process. Example markings: (i)I(Infection) =1/prime(1, mm) + 1/prime(2, mm) + 1/prime(3, mm) denes the initial concentration of the mycobacteriathat will intrude the host. We have dened threedierent positions to represent di erent injection sites; (ii)I(ImmuneSystem ) =1/prime( 1 ,m a c ,f a l s e ) + 1/prime( 2 ,m a c ,f a l s e ) +1/prime( 3 ,m a c ,f a l s e ) + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 +1/prime(10, mac, false) denes the initial concentration of healthy macrophages in the host. The positions and amount of healthymacrophages are empirical and used just to representtheir presence in the host. All other places are initially empty, that is, there are no tokens at the onset.Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 7 Infection Bacteria(pos, mm) (pos, mac, false)BacSignaliing 10 ImmuneSystem Macrophage(pos, mac, true) (pos, mac, true) (pos, mac, true) (pos, mac, true)(pos, mac, true)Macrophage Phagocytosis Macrophage Macrophage IntercellularSpread Maturation status StopSignaling(pos, mac, mm, true)(i, the CPN modeling the early stages of the immune re sponse to the mycobacterial infection process implemented in Snoopy software. 3.5. Implementation and Execution of the Model. Our model is motivated by the biology discussed in Section 2 ,a n d it specically focuses on the process of granuloma for-mation and infection dissemination. The environment ofthe model represents the innate immune response basedon the Mycobacterium marinum infection process in the zebrash embryo, although at this level, the CPN modelc a nb eu s e dt od e s c r i b et h ee a r l yi m m u n er e s p o n s et oa n ykind of mycobacterial infection process. The elements ofthe Colored Petri Net described in the previous sectionsrepresent key factors involved in the processes of infection,innate immune response, and granuloma formation. Therules of the model represent the biological interactions asdescribed in Section 2.1 , that is, (i) signaling of intruding bacteria detected by healthy macrophages followed by phagocytosis; (ii) migration and intracellular bacterial replication within infected macrophages and their death; (iii) recruitment and migration of healthy macrophages in response to the dead macrophage signals; (iv) the aggregation process and granuloma formation; (v) the bacterial spread in the aggregate macrophage and the infection dissemination. Figure 3 shows the prototype model in a colored Petri net implemented using the Snoopy software [ 38]. Arrows labeled with a black dot as an arrow head are so-called testingarcs: they represent two arcs in opposite directions betweenthe place and transition with an identical arc expression; however, the tokens are not consumed, just tested for theirpresence. Next, we will discuss the colored Petri net model inmore detail. As initial conditions to our model, we have dened some numbers as boundaries to check the behavior of the netusing the simulation mode in the Snoopy software. Theintracellular bacterial spread is limited to a concentrationof 255 bacteria. In the literature, no specic informationwas found about the capacity of a macrophage or about itsabsolute position. In early stages of the zebrash embryos,it is known where the macrophages are not present [ 6]. For this reason we have dened 10 relative positions to representthe presence of macrophages and their movement during theinfection process and granuloma formation. In order to keepthe model straightforward, we also limit the concentration ofaggregated macrophages (cf. Figure 5 ) .N e x t ,w eh a v ed e n e d a threshold concerning the infection dissemination; that is,we limit the concentration of dissident macrophages that are released from the granuloma. Although from in vivo/in vitro experiments it seems that the dissemination is regulated bythe adaptive immune system [ 5,15], we have not considered this to be in the scope of our model. The infection starts when the mycobacteria intrude the host. In our model we concentrate on three di erent positions of the mycobacteria (1, mm), (2, mm), (3, mm).Each position represents di erent injection sites used in the experiments with the zebrash animal model (yolk, caudalvein, or hindbrain ventricle). In our example, the bacteria aredetected by the innate immune system by signals to immune8 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine Infection Bacteria(pos, mm) (pos, mac, false)BacSignaliing 10 ImmuneSystem Macrophage(pos, ...1Macrophage Phagocytosis Figure 4: Screenshot of the infection detection and phagocytosis process.

Figure 4 shows this process. After phagocytosis, the bacteria start to proliferate and move within the macrophage; the macrophage changesits position, moving to deep tissue while the bacteriareplicate inside the macrophage. The intracellular growth ofmycobacteria is modeled as bacterial multiplication until aconcentration of 255, causing the death of the macrophage.Figure 5 depicts this process. A dead macrophage starts to signal, recruiting new healthy macrophages to take up the infected macrophageand the bacteria. In this way aggregates of immune cells areformed. The aggregates contain the bacteria but are unableto get rid of them. This process is visualized in Figure 6 where a dead macrophage 1 /prime(10, mac, true) is recruiting new macrophages to aggregate. The recruitment of macrophagesis controlled by the MacSignaling transition that stops whenfour healthy macrophages are recruited. The numbers ofmacrophages that are recruited are set such that a minimalnumber will give rise to the formation of a granuloma. The latter is important in the development of the infection andthe disease in general. The number can be increased if a particular scenario for an in silico experiment so requires. It will not alter the general layout of the net rather creatingdierent balances. The place RecruitmentCount controls that. As these aggregates grow, structures develop that are referred to as tuberculous granulomas, lumps of immunecells that surround the infection. Figure 7 shows the repre- sentation of this process in our model, where one granulomais formed at the position 10 with a concentration of vemacrophages 10 1 /prime(10, mac, 5). The intracellular mycobacterial spread in the granuloma is visualized in our model by the process depicted in Figure 8 . There, all ve immune cells that form the granuloma on the position 10 {5/prime(10, mac, true) }get infected and start the process of dissemination. In the dissemination process, an infected macrophage leaves the granuloma structure {3/prime(10, mac, true) }and starts another infection, moving, hosting an intracellular mycobac-terial replication, dying, and repeating the granuloma forma-tion process on another position. This process is visualized inFigure 9 .Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 9 10 ImmuneSystem Macrophage (pos, mac, true) (pos, mac, true)Macrophage true truetrue(pos, mac, infected) kRecruitmentCountConditionstatus status Screenshot of the dead macrophage signaling and aggregation process.

Conclusion and Discussion A systems' biology approach, integrating both modeling and experimental aspects, has much to contribute to thestudy of host-pathogen interactions. Biological processes that are relevant to the immune response occur at di erent scales or levels of resolution, that is, molecular, cellular,and tissue levels [ 39,40]. Development of multiscale, multi- compartment models based on in vivo/in vitro experimental data is essential to create a computational system thatreflects this biological behavior [ 40]. In our previous work [31], we provide a basic layout addressing the modeling challenges from the integration of imaging analysis data andthe Petri net formalism in di erent levels of abstraction, from epidemiological to genetic levels in a multiple-scalemodel. The aim of this work is to introduce a modeling approach new to the modeling of the innate immune response in amodel; this modeling represents the dynamic behavior of themycobacterial infection process. We consider our model torepresent a high level of abstraction in which the infectionprocess can be visualized in a large-scale model. Complexprocesses involving cell-cell or cell-bacteria communicationcan be modeled as small-scale processes and incorporatedin our model. We use the Petri net formalism as a formalmodeling method because of its extensible, modular, easy,and intuitive construction properties di erent from other and more broadly used modeling frameworks [ 32]. We have developed a high-level abstraction of the infection process by designing a PN by acknowledging the major processes of the Mycobacterium infection together with the basic actors that are involved in these processes. As a result, we have delivered a CPN model that expresses, at a high level of abstraction, the details that are involvedin the early disease of mycobacterial infection. Informationabout the early mycobacterial infection process, the innate immune response, and the infection dissemination can be observed in our model. Through a parameterizable netthat assembles information about the host-pathogenesisinteraction phases, we can visualize the dynamics of theinfection process. The scalability of our model allowsextension on di erent levels of abstraction providing the aggregation of independent and related model hierarchically,that is, gene expression pathways, molecular process, cell-to-cell interaction events, and so forth. In this manner allowingexperiments that simultaneously track molecular, cellular,tissue, organism, and population scale events, biologists havegreatly appreciated the visualization of the processes throughthe animation of the PN.Several reliable tools have been developed to create and investigate qualitative and quantitative properties of Petrinets by structural analysis, simulation of time-dependentdynamic behavior, and model checking. In the researchpresented here, we have chosen the Snoopy software [ 38] to implement and animate our model. This software is extensible and adaptive through support of simultaneous use of several models. Moreover, it is platform independent. Fur-ther extensions are to investigate the quantitative propertiesof the process. Such can be accomplished using the Charlietool [ 41] so as to verify and validate the net and further analyze our model. In summary, we have developed a straightforward model to explore the early mycobacterial infection and the immuneresponse. Modeling the steps that regulate the infectionprocess requires further testing on both theoretical andexperimental levels. The results of these in silico experi- ments/ndings can become the input for further analysis. Itwill support, for example, identication of key parametersor mechanisms, interpretation of data, or comparison ofthe capability of di erent mechanisms to (re)generate the observed data. Finally, a model that successfully describesexisting experimental data may be used in the predictionof results from new experiments and generation of furtherhypotheses about the immune system response to mycobac-terial infection helping to unravel the mechanisms of TBinfection [ 42]. In this manner it can contribute to treatment. As indicated from the design of our CPN, the next steps inthe development of the net are to add lower-level processesrepresenting the tissue, cellular, and molecular interactions relevant to the infection process. The CPN accommodates this as hierarchical layers. Along with these layers, numericaldata will become available that will allow to elaborate onthe quantitative aspects of this process. The interplay ofhierarchical levels and quantitative information has thepotential to develop to a powerful tool for the research intuberculosis disease, and hopefully it will further mature in aparadigm for integrated research to infection diseases.

Bacterial infections can be of two types: acute or chronic. The chronic bacterial infections are characterized by being a large bacterial infection and/or an infection where the bacteria gr ows rapidly. In these cases, the immune response is not capable of completely eliminating the infection which may lead to the f ormation of a pattern known as microabscess (or abscess). The microabscess is characterized by an area comprising fluids, bacteria, immune cells (mainly neutrophils), and many types of dead cells. This distinct pattern of formation can only be numerically r eproduced and studied by models that capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of the human immune system (HIS). In this context, our work aims to develop and implement an initial computationalmodel to study the process of microabscess formation during a bacterial infection. 1. Introduction The immune system is one of the most important and complex system of our organism. Despite great advances inrecent years that shed light on its understanding and unravelthe underlying key mechanisms behind its functions, thereare still many functions of the human immune system (HIS)that are not well understood. Computational models of HISdynamics can contribute to a better understanding of therelationship between cells and molecules of the HIS. In this study, we developed a mathematical model of some cells and molecules of the HIS to reproduce thespatiotemporal dynamics of the initial formation of microab-scesses during an immune response to a bacteria. T o reproduce these dynamics, we introduce a mathe- matical model composed of a system of partial di erential equations (PDEs) that extends our previous models [ 1,2] and denes the dynamics of representative cells and mol-ecules of the HIS during the immune response to abacteria. The model presented is descriptive, mechanistic,and deterministic; therefore, it enables the understanding of how di erent complex phenomena, structures, and elementsinteract during an immune response. In addition, the model's parameters reflect the physiological features of thesystem, making the model appropriate for general use. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, the necessary biological background is presented. Next,related works are briefly discussed. This exposition is fol-lowed by a description of the mathematical model proposedin this work and the numerical scheme used to implement it.Then simulation results obtained from the proposed modelare discussed, and, nally, our conclusions and plans forfuture work are presented. 2. Biological Background The initial response of the host to a diverse array of biologicalstressors including bacterial infection, burns, trauma, andinvasive surgery is an inflammatory response. Despite thegrowing understanding of the cellular and molecular mecha-nisms of inflammation, the complexity of the inflammatoryresponse has challenged therapeutic development [ 3,4]. A key reason for this conundrum has been speculated to2 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine be the di culty of predicting the impact of manipulating individual components of the highly complex, nonlinear,and redundant inflammatory response [ 5]. Thus, progress would require a greater understanding of how componentsare organized. This makes systems biology based approachesappealing [ 6]. Most inflammatory reactions begin as a suppurative or purulent exudation process when the rst line of cellulardefense, the neutrophils, accumulate in the area. A sup-purative process is characterized by the presence of pus(neutrophils mixed with cellular debris). Classically, there arethree requisites of suppuration: (i) presence of neutrophils that release proteolytic enzymes, (ii) necrosis of some types, (iii) liquefaction. This suppurative process may lead to the formation of microabscesses. A microabscess is a localized collection of dead cells, body fluids, microbes, and other cells of the HIS. The process of formation of a microabscess begins when acell of the HIS encounters bacteria and warn other cells thatthere is a stranger in the host. Its \"warn\" is in the form ofa class of biochemicals called cytokines, which beckon otherHIS cells to come to the point of infection and surround theenemy. Most often all this goes unnoticed because the rst few immune system cells phagocytize (engulf and digest) theinvaders and the battle is nished. But every so often, aninvader has a trick to escape the immune response andcannot be killed by the phagocytes. Those bacteria continueto grow and to spew out whatever they do. More and moreimmune system cells, mainly neutrophils, congregate at theinfection site trapping the pathogens in the center. If thismicroabscess is close enough to the body surface, it can beseen as a blob of pus under the skin. When a microabscess iswell developed, it has a wall or capsule of brous connectivetissue separating it from the surrounding tissue, helpingto prevent any microbes present in the microabscess fromspreading to other areas of the body. Thus, microabscessesc a nb ec o n s i d e r e da san a t u r a ls t r a t e g yu s e dt o g h ta g a i n s tinfection. Microabscesses are found in many di erent diseases, for instance, the authers in [ 7-10] present animal studies detailing the formation of liver microabscess and microab-scess by di erent types of infections. Epidermal microabscess formation by neutrophils was also evaluated in [ 11-14]. Infection of the heart by bacteria (bacterial myocarditis[15]) or by viruses (viral myocarditis [ 16]) is also correlated with microabscess formation by neutrophils. The interac-tion between tumor cells and inflammatory cells plays animportant role in cancer initiation and progression andwas investigated in [ 17] for the case of tumor-inltrating neutrophils in pancreatic neoplasia, where the pattern ofmicroabscess formation by neutrophils was reported onceagain.3. Related W ork This section presents and discusses other mathematical andcomputational models of the immune response. Essentially,two distinct approaches are used: agent-based models andordinary di erential equations (ODEs). These models have some features in common with our model. All modelsinclude representative cells and molecules of the innateimmune system. For example, neutrophils, macrophages,and proinflammatory cytokines are modeled in the majorityof models. Some models as our model consider the impor-tant interactions between endothelial cells, tissue cells, andcytokines. Despite some similarities with our model, none ofthe works focus on modeling microabscesses. 4. Models Based on Agents In [ 18,19], it was developed an agent-based model of the dynamics of some cells, such as polymorphonuclearleukocytes (PMNs) and mononuclear cells and molecules,such as TNF- and IL-1, during the initial inflammatory response in the interface endothelium/blood at the capillarylevel. Some characteristics of the model are as follows: (i) all the cells are represented as agents whose behavior is close to the real; (ii) it considers the interactions between endothelial cells and circulating inflammatory cells at the blood/bloodvessel-lining interface; (iii) the initial injury number (IIN) denes the number of tissue cells that are dead initially; (iv) the oxygen concentration is one important variable in the model; (v) the total tissue damage is represented as a decit in the oxygen variable; (vi) the injury state of an endothelial cell depends on the available oxygen concentration; (vii) proinflammatory mediators and endothelial cells sur- face adhesion molecules are modeled by state vari-ables; (viii) it considers a generic pathogen that causes the infec- tion. The work aims to reproduce the time course of the early inflammatory response associated with the Systemic Inflammatory Syndrome Response (SIRS)/Multiple OrganFailure (MOF) from massive trauma or large exposure toendotoxin. The objective of the simulations were to comparethe results with the soluble TNF-receptor experiment [ 20] where the soluble TNF-receptor is tested as a therapeutictreatment for the sepsis. The author claims that his resultsgenerally replicate the results of several large-scale clinicaltrials of cytokine-directed antimediator agents. In [ 6], an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework is proposed to study the nonlinear dynamics of acuteinflammatory responses to LPS. Their work uses an agent-based approach to elucidate molecular interactions involvedComputational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 3 Table 1: Initial conditions.

Some relevantcharacteristics considered in the model are as follows: (i) molecular interactions, (ii) cellular heterogeneity, (iii) LPS/TLR4 signal transduction pathway, (iv) transcriptional response. The proposed in silico model is evaluated through its ability to successfully reproduce a self-limited inflammatoryresponse as well as a series of scenarios: a persistent(non)infectious response or innate immune tolerance and potentiation e ects followed by perturbations in intracellular signaling molecules and cascades. 5. Models Based on ODEs The model of [ 21] studies immunomodulatory strategies for treating cases of severe sepsis. They introduced andevaluated the concept of conducting a randomized clinical trial in silico based on simulated patients generated from a mechanistic mathematical model of bacterial infection,acute inflammatory response, global tissue dysfunction, and a therapeutic intervention. Trial populations are constructed to reflect heterogeneity in bacterial load and virulence aswell as propensity to mount and modulate an inflammatoryresponse. They constructed a cohort of 1000 trial patientssubmitted to therapy with one of three di erent doses of a neutralizing antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor(anti-TNF) for 6, 24, or 48 hrs. Their focus was to assess thefeasibility of using di erential equation models to improve the design of clinical trials. This paper replicates in silico the general ndings from actual clinical trials\u2014that it is verydicult to design a treatment strategy that is e ective over a broad range of sepsis patients. 6. Hybrid Models In [22], a hybrid model that coupled an agent-based model [18,19] and a system dynamics/di erential equation model [21] was created using the System Dynamics tool within Netlogo [ 23]. They developed an interface between the agent-based and system dynamics models.

They implemented a simple system dynam-ics model that focused on systemic polymorphoneutrophils(PMN) production, maturation, sequestration, and release.Some of the flows inside the system dynamics model wereinfluenced by the conditions within the agent-based model.The primary role of the system dynamics model was tomanifest a delay between the elevation of the cytokines in the tissue and the increase in PMNs in the circulating blood. The objective of the work was to reproduce some of the results ofthe agent-based model [ 18,19] using the hybrid model. 7. Mathematical Model Our main objective is to develop a parameterized mathe- matical model of the human innate immune system thatsimulates the immune response occurring in a generic tissue.T o achieve this goal, we rst build a model of the immuneresponse to LPS [ 1,2]. In this work, we extend this model to reproduce the spatiotemporal dynamics of a bacterialinfection and the process of microabscess formation.The mathematical model simulates the temporal and spatial behavior of bacteria ( B), dead cells (TD). Macrophages are present in twostates of readiness: resting (RM) and hyperactivated (AM). We must stress that the equations modeling proinflamma-tory cytokines are generic in the sense that they model therole of distinct cytokines taking part in the inflammatoryprocess. Equation parameters can be adjusted to model therole of a specic proinflammatory cytokine. The relationships among all of the model's are described next. Neutrophils, resting macrophages, andactive macrophages phagocytose the bacteria. The neu-trophils then undergo apoptosis, which may or may notbe induced by the phagocytosis process. In this di erent state, apoptotic neutrophils cannot phagocytosisor produce proinflammatory cytokines; as a result, apop-totic neutrophils are eliminated from the body after beingphagocytosed by active macrophages. Apoptotic neutrophilswill die after a period of time, releasing cytotoxic granulesand degradation enzymes in the medium that cause tissuedamage destroying healthy tissue cells. Active neutrophilsand bacteria also cause tissue damage by producing toxic6 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 4 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 04.5y(mm) 4 4.5 3.53 2.52 1.51 0.50 x(mm)5.5 5 4.5 43.532.521.514 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 04.5y(mm) 4 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 04.5y(mm)4 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 04.5y(mm)4 4.5 2.52 87 6 6 5 4.543.5311 109 78 6 5Apoptotic neutrophil (time =2 days, 0 Apoptotic days, 0 Apoptotic days, 0 hour) Apoptotic neutrophil (time =10 days, 0 hour) Figure 4: T emporal evolution and spatial distribution of apoptotic neutrophil. products that are not modeled here. The infection site is \"cleaned\" by resting and active macrophages that do thephagocytosis of dead tissue cells. Healthy tissue cells incontact with bacteria, neutrophils, and active macrophagesproduce proinflammatory cytokines. The proinflammatorycytokines increase the of the blood vessels; consequently, more neutrophils and monocytes are recruited to the infected tissue. In addition, the proinflammatorycytokines act as a chemoattractant substance to the restingmacrophages, active macrophages, and neutrophils. Below, we provide the equations derived from the model.

Thegfunction returns the percentage of free space in a discretized area of the two-dimensional space and its use ismotivated by some important biological concepts such asquorum sensing/volume sensing [ 24,25,27-29].

The mathematical model presented here introduced some modications to our previous model [ 2] with the aim to reproduce the microabscess formation. We included equations for the dynamics of the tissue to take intoaccount some e ects of infection such as tissue damage and production of cytokines by tissue cells. We also replaced theLPS equation in our previous model [ 2] by the bacteria equation with a term for reproduction of bacteria. Besideswe modied the calculus of the di usion and chemotaxis terms [ 24] (a) to limit the number of cells that are allowed to stay at the same time in the same area of the domain and(b) to reduce the e ciency of the di usion and chemotaxis processes in overcrowded regions. More specically, themethod we implemented incorporates the following generalmechanisms which may lead to dispersal of the population[24]. (i) Population pressure: we assume that a high cell den- sity results in increased probability of a cell being10 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine pushed from a site, for example, due to the pres- sure exerted by neighboring cells. This is achievedphenomenologically with the ffunction of our mathematical model and the changes in di usion and chemotaxis calculus. (ii) Limited space: here we assume that no more cells can enter a site above a total cell density. In our model, this is achieved with the incorporation of the gfunc- tion in the di usion and chemotaxis calculations. (iii) Gradient detection: cells may detect and respond to a local gradient in the cell density and as a consequencecells can move to higher concentrations of theattractant substance. 8. Implementation The numerical method used to solve the mathematical modelwas the Finite Di erence Method [ 31], a method commonly used in the numeric discretization of PDEs. A complex part of the resolution of the PDEs is the resolution of the convective term, the chemotaxis term. The development of numerical methods to approximate convec- tive terms (in most cases not linear) have been subject ofintense researches [ 32-35]. Dierent numerical approaches have been proposed for the discretization of the chemotaxis term [ 36,37]. Our implementation is based on the nite di erence method for the spatial discretization and the explicit Euler method forthe time evolution. The discretization of the chemotaxis term( \u00b7(NNCH)) uses the First-Order Upwind scheme [ 38]. Therefore, the precision of our numerical implementationis rst-order in time (explicit Euler) upwind PDEs through the use of di erences with bias in the direction given by the signal of the characteristics' speeds.The upwind scheme uses an adaptive or solution-sensitivestencil to numerically simulate more precisely the directionof information propagation. In two-dimension, the upwind scheme approximates the chemotaxis term as the sum of the flux in the xdirection (resX) with the flux in the ydirection (res Y). resXis the sum of the flux left at the point xdeltaX/2 with the flux right at the point x+ deltaX/2a n dr e sYis the sum of the flux up at the point ydeltaY/2 with the flux down at the point y+ deltaY/2i n Algorithm 1 . In this the proinflammatory cytokine, nrepresents the discretization of neutrophils, wis the total density of cells in a position of the space,xandyare the positions in space, and delta Xand deltaYare the spatial discretizations in xandydirections, respectively. The test made is to dene what is the signal ofthe characteristic speed, where the speed of the movement ofN(y,x) is given by the term CH. This value is then used to choose between two schemes of nite di erences: forward or backward. We decided to implement our own numerical method to solve the systems of PDEs because (a) we have the possibilityto parallelize the code and (b) most of the numerical librariesoer few functions that are suitable to our problem. The sequential code was implemented in C. 9. Numerical Experiments We performed several simulations in order to verify thatthe model's results are in agreement with what is describedin the literature. Our objective was to reproduce somecharacteristics of the microabscess such as an accumulationof dead cells and bacteria in the infection site. The model's initial conditions and parameters are given in Tables 1and 2,r e s p e c t i v e l y . InTable 2 , parameters marked with were adjusted to qualitatively reproduce the results obtained in several studiesof the immune response to LPS. In the case of the bacteria(results not shown here), we adjust the equation parametersin order to obtain an exponential decrease in time as shownin [39]. The results of the concentration of proinflammatory cytokines in time (results not shown here) are qualitativelysimilar to those obtained in some experimental works [ 40- 42]. The parameters marked with were based on the values given in the references but were adjusted due to the useof distinct units (e.g., from liter to mm 3)o rt o ti na2 5m m2 tissue. In this paper, we obtained parameter values forhumans whenever they were available. The variables and total in ( 5)a n d( 4) were dened based on the concentrations of neutrophils and macrophages per liter given in [ 43]a n d were adjusted (a) due to the use of distinct units (e.g., fromliter to mm 3)a n d( b )t o ti na2 5 m m2tissue. The variable total represents the maximum density of cells that ts in adiscretized area of the tissue. In the next sections, we will show the results of the simulation performed with the parameters given in Table 2 . In this simulation, we considered a 5 mm \u00d75m m t w o - dimensional domain representing a tissue with 25 mm2of area and a simulation time of 5 days. In our model, theexchange between the vascular system (arterioles and vessels)and tissue was assumed to occur only at the points (1, 1),(1, 4), and (4, 2 .5), In this point, immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) that are in the blood stream can enterinto the tissue. The communication between blood vesselsand tissue is modeled by permeabilities that vary in timeand may depend on the concentration of di erent cells and molecules (in our model, the endothelium permeability of neutrophils and macrophages depends on the concentration of the proinflammatory cytokine). 10. Bacteria In the case of bacteria ( Figure 1 ), we observe that initially the bacteria di uses through the tissue causing tissue damage without its presence to be noticed. As soon as resting macrophages residents in the tissue recognize the bacteria they start to produce proinflammatorycytokines that will di use through the tissue reaching the blood vessel. Once proinflammatory cytokines interactwith the endothelial cells an increase in the occurs allowing neutrophils and monocytes tomigrate to the tissue.Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 11 float chemotaxis (float n,fl o a tch, intx, inty,fl o a tw) { flux left=0; flux right =0; if (x>0) { if ((ch[y][x]ch[y][x1])>0) { flux left=(ch[y][x]-c h [y][x1])n[y][x1]g(w[y][x1])f(w[y][x1])/deltaX; } else { flux left=(ch[y][x]-c h [y][x1])n[y][x]g(w[y][x])f(w[y][x])/deltaX; } } if (x<(size1)) { if ((ch[y][x+1 ]-c h [ y][x])>0) { flux right =(ch[y][x+1 ]-c h [ y][x])n[y][x]g(w[y][x])f(w[y][x])/deltaX; } else { flux h ]g(w[y][x+1 ] up=0; flux if h [y1] [x])>0) { flux up=(ch[y][x]-c h [y1][x])n[y1][x]g(w[y1][x])f(w[y1][x])/deltaY; } else { flux up=(ch[y][x]-c h [y1][x])n[y][x]g(w[y][x])f(w[y][x])/deltaY; } } if (y<(size1)) { if ((ch[y+1 h [y][x])>0) { flux down =(ch[y+1 ][x]-c h [y][x])n[y+1 ][x]g(w[y+1 ][x])f(w[y+1 Y; return (res X+r e sY); } Algorithm 1 T h eb a c t e r i as t a r t st od i eal o td u et ot h ep r e s e n c eo fh u g e numbers of neutrophils. However, the immune response cannot completely eliminate bacteria due to the formation of themicroabscess pattern. In the microabscess, there are bacteriaand a huge concentration of dead cells around it (Figures4,5,a n d 6). In this context, the cleaning process realized by macrophages is very important to allow neutrophilsto reach bacteria and eliminate them. Macrophages areresponsible for phagocyte dead cells that accumulated in themicroabscess.

Neutrophil Neutrophils are initially attracted to the tissue by proin-flammatory cytokines produced by activated residentmacrophages ( Figure a neutrophil encounters bac- it phagocytizes bacteria and starts to produce proin-flammatory cytokines that will attract more neutrophilsand macrophages. The cytokine gradient will guide the movement of neutrophils and macrophages in the direction of the highest bacteria concentration. After the microabscess formation, the immune system cells lose contact with a high number of bacteria. As thesecells tend to move following the cytokine gradient, we canobserve an accumulation of them around the microabscess. After a signicant number of macrophages phagocyte dead cells, the neutrophils can encounter the bacteria andphagocyte them from the border to the center of themicroabscess area. As a consequence, a reduction in themicroabscess area is observed ( Figure 1 ), which indicates that the immune response is succeeding in controlling theinfection.12. Cytokine The cytokines in Figure 3 are produced primarily by resident macrophages that are the rst to recognize the bacteriapresence. The cytokines will increase the endotheliumpermeability allowing neutrophils to migrate to the tissue.The arrived neutrophils will produce even more cytokinesthat will guide the movement of neutrophils and macrophagecells in the direction of high concentrations of bacteria. During the formation of the microabscess and after it, the production of cytokines is higher in the regions where neutrophils and macrophages have contact with the bacteriathat is surrounding the microabscess. 13. Apoptotic Neutrophils InFigure 4 , it can be observed that initially the neutrophils that came from the blood vessel closer to the site of infectiondied in large number than the neutrophils that came fromother sites. Then, after microabscess formation, a lot ofneutrophils start to die around the entire microabscess. Thisphenomenon continues until the microabscess disappears.Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 13 4 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 04.5y(mm) 4 4.5 3.53 2.52 1.51 0.50 x(mm)9 8 7654324 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 04.5y(mm) 4 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 04.5y(mm)4 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 04.5y(mm)4 4.5 2.52 65 4321 0 8 7 6 5 432108 7 65 4 3 2 1 0Healthy tissue (time =2 days, 0 hour) Healthy tissue (time =4 days, 0 hour) Healthy tissue (time =7 days, 0 hour) Healthy tissue (time =10 days, 0 hour) Figure 7: T emporal evolution and spatial distribution of healthy tissue cells. 14. Dead Bacteria Figure 5 shows that initially more bacteria died near blood vessels. After the formation of the microabscess, the bacteriastarts to die around the entire microabscess since this is thearea where the immune response is acting. 15. Tissue Cells InFigure 6 , it can be observed that a lot of tissue damage by bacteria during the period the immune system took tomount an e ective immune response. The number of dead tissue cells then reduces, because of the phagocytosis realizedby macrophages. Figure 7 shows the evolution of the healthy tissue area destroyed by the bacteria. 16. Microabscess Area Figure 8 shows the microabscess area using a set of level curves. We dened the microabscess as an area where theconcentration of bacteria plus concentration of dead bacteriaplus the concentrations of damaged tissue and apoptoticneutrophil is higher. These results show that our model wascapable to reproduce the formation of the microabscess in agreement with the observed characteristics of a microab-scess [ 7,14,49-54]. 17. Conclusions and Future W orks In this work, we presented a computational model for the dynamics of representative types of cells and moleculesof the HIS during an immune response to a bacteria.Despite the simplications and limitations of the model,our results showed that we were able to reproduce an initial microabscess formation. The spatial results show a collection of dead tissue cells, dead bacteria, and apoptotic neutrophilin the microabscess region.

As future work, we plan to perform a detailed sensitivity analysis of our microabscess formation model. A previouswork [ 55] has given us some hints about the most sensitivity parameter of the model.

For example, we plan to consider amore adequate model to represent the structure of the tissue14 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine x(mm)y(mm)Microabscess area 00.511.522.533.544.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 56.5419 46.1662 35.790625.415 15.0394 Figure 8: Level curves highlighting the microabscess area at day 5 of the immune response. and its constituents. The tissue can be better characterized as a multiphasic porous medium subjected to stress anddeformation variations mainly during the inflammatoryprocess. This porous medium would comprise fluids, extra-cellular matrix, cells, and molecules. We also plan to modelthe mechanical behaviour of each of these phases and themechanical interactions between them. We have interest in developing models for processes such as vasodilation, coagulation, and others and analyse its e ects on the mechanical behaviour of immune system cells and theconsequences for the immune response. With the aim to investigate better the formation of the microabscess, we plan to add another features that con-tribute to this formation such as the e ects of extracellular pH on immune response [ 56]. Acidic pH predominates at inflammatory loci and other sites of immune activity. Investigations on neutrophils demonstrate mainly inhibitionof chemotaxis, respiratory activity, and bactericidal capacityat reduced pH. Besides diminished extracellular pH mayplay a role in suppressing cytokine production and cytotoxicactivities by pulmonary macrophages [ 56]. Besides we plan to add to the model the process of brous tissue formation around the microabscess. We planto investigate what factors determine if the brous tissuewill be produced or not. The production of brous tissueas well as the coagulation process are ways of the immunesystem to prevent the bacteria to spread throughout thebody doing damage with possible serious consequences,for example, SIRS/MOF. In particular, we are interestedin modeling the participation of macrophages, broblasts,tissue cells, endothelial cells, and many mediators in theprocess of brous tissue formation. An important step inthis process is the production of collagen by broblastsinduced by the cytokine TGF- produced by macrophages[57,58]. The macrophages has many roles in the processes of wound healing and tissue repair. For example, duringthe coagulation process, macrophages and endothelial cellsare responsible for the production of diverse growth factorsand chemotcatic substances that attracts and stimulates theproliferation of tissue cells initiating tissue repair [ 59].

Studies of the response of the immune system to feline immunodeciency virus (FIV) during primary infection have shown that a subpopulation of CD8+T-cells with an activated phenotype and reduced expression of the CD8 chain (denoted CD8 lowTc e l l s ) expands to reach up to 80% of the total CD8+T cell count. The expansion of this subpopulation is considered to be a signature of FIV and an indicator of immune system alteration. We use a simple mathematical formalism to study the relationships over time between the dose of infection, the size of the CD8 lowpopulation, and the circulating viral load in cats infected with FIV . Viremia proles are described using a combination of two exponential laws, whereas the CD8 lowpercentage (out of the total CD8+population) is represented by a Gompertz law including an expansion phase and a saturation phase. Model parameters are estimated with a population approach using data from 102 experi mentally infected cats. We examine the dose of infection as a potential covariate of parameters. We nd that the rates of increase of viral load and of CD8 lowpercentage are both correlated with the dose of infection. Cats that develop strong acute viremia also show the largest degree of CD8 lowexpansion. The two simple models are robust tools for analysing the time course of CD8 lowpercentage and circulating viral load in FIV-infected cats and may be useful for generating new insights on the disease and on the design of therapeutic strategies, potentially applicable toHIV infection. 1. Introduction Cats infected with the feline immunodeciency virus (FIV) develop an acquired immunodeciency syndrome (AIDS) much like humans infected with HIV [ 1]. The infection causes an acute viremia, which decreases after several weeks, and the development of a partial immunity [ 2]. The acute stage is followed by a chronic asymptomatic phase, oftenpersisting for years, during which the immune system is progressively impaired. As in the case of HIV infection, the more common signs of the asymptomatic phase are thedepletion of CD4 +peripheral T cells and the reduction of the CD4/CD8 ratio [ 3]. At the end of the asymptomatic stage of the disease, infected cats develop chronic opportunistic infections and eventually die [ 4]. The immune response to FIV during acute infection is well documented in the literature (see in particular [ 5-7]). In addition to anti-FIV neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxicand noncytotoxic CD8 +T cells, the primary (acute) stage of infection is known to be characterized by the appearanceand expansion of a CD8 +T-cell subpopulation with an activated phenotype showing reduced expression of the2 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine CD8chain and the complete disappearance of the L-selectin CD62L surface molecule [ 8]. These CD8 lowCD62LT cells, hereafter referred to as CD8 lowcells, persist throughout the course of infection. The persistence of this activatedT-cell population, which has been shown to possess anti-FIV activity, suggests a profound homeostatic disorder, as in healthy animals activated CD8 cells are generally present only during peak immune responses. The observed expansion of the CD8 lowcell subpop- ulation\u2014which can reach, during the acute stage, up to 80%of the total population of CD8 +T cells\u2014may be driven by CD8lowcells' sensitivity to apoptosis, a sensitivity that is enhanced by antigen recognition [ 2]. CD8lowcells might be chronically activated as a result of persistent virus replicationand antigen recognition, die by apoptosis and get replenishedquickly. Thus, it is believed that FIV can alter the immunehomeostasis by inducing chronic activation of CD8 +Tc e l l s into CD8low, driving their expansion, and, at the same time, inducing cytotoxicity against infected CD4+T cells. The expansion of the CD8 lowsubpopulation is con- sidered to be an important marker of FIV infection anddisease [ 2]. A characterization of the process of expansion, in addition to other markers of disease, is likely to increaseresearchers' understanding of FIV infection and AIDSpathogenesis, thus facilitating the design of new therapeuticstrategies. Mathematical models to describe longitudinal data from HIV-infected patients have been extensively developed [ 9]. T o describe the dynamics of viremia and CD4 +T cells, numerous models have used systems of ordinary di erential equations based on the prey-predator modelling framework [10-13]. In this type of model, viral particles infect healthy CD4+T cells, which later die, liberating new replicated virus into the plasma. One of the most interesting aspects of thismechanistic approach is that each model parameter has aclear biological meaning, such as rate of infection of CD4 + T cells, the cell lifespan, or the virus replication rate. Suchmodels have been shown to correctly predict circulating viralloads in HIV-infected patients undergoing antiviral therapies[11]. Some variations of this modelling approach have been discussed in the literature. For instance, the integrationof cytotoxic CD8 +T cells has been shown to potentially describe with more accuracy the kinetics of viremia in HIVpatients [ 14]. Models based on the prey-predator framework can provide interesting insights into the life cycle of thevirus and its interaction with the host. However, thesemodels tend to be complex, as they generally integrate alarge number of parameters and variables such as viral load,CD4 +Tc e l l so fd i erent status (e.g., uninfected, early- stage infected, late-stage infected), and di erent types of CD8+T cells. Proper estimation of such parameters requires a large number of observations (ideally, observations forall variables should be available) for all individuals to beanalyzed. Obviously, these are di cult conditions to meet in a clinical setting. Furthermore, it is known that the immune response can vary signicantly across subjects, andit might therefore be too simplistic to assume parametersto be constant in a given population of patients. The needto integrate interindividual results adds an additional levelof complexity to the already complex mechanistic model. Finally, to our knowledge, such models have not yet beenchallenged with data from untreated primary infection (e.g.,data from untreated HIV-infected patients or from FIV-infected cats), so the information they provide regarding thenatural progression of disease may be limited. In this study, we propose two phenomenological models that correctly reproduce the time-evolution of the percentageof CD8 lowCD62LT cells and of circulating viral load during the early primary infection phase in 102 cats infectedwith various doses of FIV . 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Ethic Statement. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the European Community regulations,and all procedures were supervised and approved by theMerial Ethical Committee. 2.2. Animals. In this experiment, 102 cats (49 males and 53 females; mean age: 22.8 weeks, SD: 7.7, range: 13-36.5) were randomized into 23 groups of 4 to 7 cats each.Each group was assigned an FIV strain (Petaluma cladeA, Glasgow-8 clade A, or EV A clade B) and inoculumsize. Each cat was challenged with a single intramuscularinjection of 1 mL of viral suspension of one of the three FIVstrains examined. In preliminary in vitro experiments, the three strains were observed to be comparable in terms of viremia and impact on lymphocyte subpopulations. Virusdilutions ranged from 1/90,000 to 1/3, and the infectiondoses, expressed in log 10/mL of cell culture infectious dose 50% (CCID50), ranged from 0.26 to 4.09 (median: 2.5, SD:1.21). 2.3. Longitudinal Measurements. Viral load was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Foreach cat, a measurement was taken at time 0, and, whenpossible, additional measurements were taken at the endsof weeks 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 23. Values wereexpressed as log 10of viral RNA copies per millilitre of plasma. For these measurements, the detection threshold, orthe limit of quantication (LOQ), was 80 copies per mL,which corresponds to 1.9 on the log 10scale. In total, 485 measurements were analyzed, but there was high variabilityin the number of measurements per cat (mean =4.75 measurements/cat, min =1, max =7, SD =1.2). The values themselves (all taken together) were also highly variable(median =3.95 log 10RNA copies/mL of and the total number of CD8+T cells were measured by flow cytometry as d e s c r i b e di n[ 2]. However, data on these lymphocytes were available for only 79 cats out of the total 102. The size ofthe CD8 lowCD62Lsubpopulation was expressed as the percentage of CD8 lowCD62LT cells in the entire CD8+ T-cell population.

Time is expressed as weeks after infection. Viral load was measured in 102 cats, but CD8 lowcell counts were measured in only 79 cats. CD8lowpercentage was 22% (min =1%, max =96%, SD = 20.5). Figure 1 shows the time-evolution of viral load in all 102 cats ( Figure 1(a) ) and CD8 lowpercentage in the 79 cats (Figure 1(b) ) for which lymphocyte counts were available. The curves indicate high variability across cats in both viralload and CD8 lowpercentages. 2.4. Data Analysis. The high variability in the number of available data points per animal, as well as the variabilityacross animals in the patterns of the data, required theuse of mixed-e ects regression techniques. Mixed-e ects models take into account di erent forms of variability and, in particular, interindividual variability [ 15]. More precisely, they use the available information from all individuals of ananalyzed population to retrieve both population-level andindividual-level values for the dynamic parameters. As aconsequence, they are particularly suited for the analysis ofdatasets with large numbers of individuals, even if data aresparse for some of the individuals. In their general form, such models can be written as follows: y ij=f/parenleftBig xij,i/parenrightBig vations for individual i,xthe regression variable (e.g., time), andythe observations. The term frepresents deterministic equations; in our case, these are simple phenomenologicallaws. The residual error is g(x ij,i)ij,w h e r eijN(0,2). In what follows we will consider constant error models, thatis,g(x ij,i)=1. Each individual e ects andhis some pre- dened transformation. Here, we assume that the individualparameters are log-normally distributed (i.e., h(u) =eu). is a p-vector of xed population parameters (i.e., h() is the median value across individuals for each of the p parameters). is thep\u00d7pvariance-covariance matrix of the random e ects. We assume potential correlations between the random e ects, meaning that is a full matrix. The unknown set of parameters in the model is then =/parenleftbig,,2/parenrightbig. (3) The likelihood function related to this problem can be written as follows: to the random e ects, the likelihood function cannot be easily computed andmaximized. One intuitive means of addressing this problemis to analyze the data from each individual separately. Thisa p p r o a c h ,h o w e v e r ,r e q u i r e sal a r g en u m b e ro fo b s e r v a t i o n sper individual, and therefore it is clearly not feasible inour case. An alternative method is the SAEM algorithm(stochastic approximation of the EM algorithm [ 16]), which can be used to calculate the maximum likelihood, withoutany approximation of the likelihood function and to estimate4 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine population ( ) and individual ( i) parameters. We used Monolix software (Lixoft) to estimate those parameters. Thesoftware analyzes all individual data simultaneously. In arst step, a likelihood function is minimized in order toestimate the mean values of the model parameters as wellas their variability throughout the population. The resultant estimates are referred to as the population parameters. In a second step, information on the mean parameter values isused to estimate, on the basis of each individual dataset, thebest model parameters for each individual. These are calledindividual parameters. Mixed-e ects models also have the advantage of being associated with a large panel of validation tools. The log-likelihood (LLH) value (actually 2\u00d7LLH) is generally used to select the best model from among multiple models.However, since a model with a greater number of parametersis more likely to produce a better t because it has moredegrees of freedom, a penalty term is generally added to thelikelihood function to account for the number of parameters.Examples of criterion functions that include such penaltyterms are the Akaike information criterion (AIC): AIC =2\u00d7LLH + 2\u00d7n, (6) wherenis the number of free parameters to be estimated, and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC): BIC=2\u00d7LLH + log (k)\u00d7n, (7) wherekis the sample size. We tested di erent types of phenomenological models, and we selected the best ones on the basis of three criterionfunctions\u2014namely, 2\u00d7LLH, AIC, and BIC values\u2014 goodness of t, residual plots, and precision of parameterestimates as relative standard errors. We assessed simulation-based diagnostics through visual predictive check, that is, wegraphically compared the observed data and the simulateddata (using population parameters and both interindividualand residual variability). We calculated -shrinkage and - shrinkage to evaluate the degree of shrinkage of individualpredictions towards the observations [ 17]. High values of shrinkage ( >30%) are considered to impair diagnostics based on individual predictions and covariate analysis [ 17]. 3. Results 3.1. Modelling Viremia. We rst formulated a model to describe the observed pattern of acute increase in viral load followed by decay, as shown in Figure 1(a) . The best model we identied was a sum of two exponentials, describing,respectively, the growth and decay parts of the curves: V =A0kin kinkout/parenleftBig ekouttekint/parenrightBig , (8) whereVis the viral load, expressed as log 10of the number of viral RNA copies per mL of plasma; kinandkoutare the two parameters regulating, respectively, the increase anddecay of viral load; A 0is a scaling adimensional parameter. Figure 2(a) shows a schematic view and focuses on the e ectof changing the value of the parameter kin. The higher the parameter value, the more rapid the increase in viral load.Interanimal variability in the model parameters ( A 0,kin,kout) was assumed to be log-normally distributed, and cat-specicestimates are given as follows, for example, for k in: kini=kinekin i, (9) wherekinis the typical value for the population (mean value) andkin iis an inter-animal random e ect that follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 2 kin. In a second step, the dose of infection and the virus strain were evaluated as continuous and, respectively, categoricalcovariates. We used a backward-stepwise method to testhow inclusion of these covariates a ected the three model parameters [ 18]. Virus strain had no signicant e ect on the values of any of the three parameters, whereas dose ofinfection, expressed in log 10/mL of CCID50, a ected the constant rate of increase of viral load. Dose of infectionwas successfully integrated into k in, which can be written as follows: kin=kinekin\u00d7DOSE. (10) With this covariate integration, the objective function ( 2\u00d7 LLH) was reduced by 58 points, the parameter kinwas estimated with high precision ( P<0.001), and the variability on thekinparameter decreased by 30%. Consequently, the value of parameter kinincreases as the inoculum size increases, ranging from 0.074 weeks1 for the lowest dose to 3.55 weeks1for the highest dose. This result indicates that the higher the dose of infection,the stronger the increase of viral load in the acute phase.The parameter k outwas estimated at 0.025 weeks1,a n d the scaling factor A0at 5.56. All parameters were estimated with low-standard errors. Table 1 presents the parameter estimates of the model as mean values, with standard deviation of random e ects or inter-animal variability (IAV). Figure 3 shows model diagnostics with a visual predictive check, that is, the simulation of the population model with95% of variability together with the data points ( Figure 3(a) ) and individual predictions plotted against the actual obser-vations ( Figure 3(b) ). Correlation between predictions and observations is good ( r 2=0.81, P<0.001). In Figure 4 ,w e show individual predictions with a 95% condence intervalaround the predictions for six cats taken from the analyzedpopulation and who were challenged with infection dosesfrom 1.65 to 4.09 log 10/mL. The model correctly predicts the time-evolution of viral load in the individual cats, and arelationship is demonstrated between the dose of infectionand the rate of increase of viral load in plasma duringthe primary stage of infection. This correlation is showninFigure 5(a) , where the estimated values of parameter k in for all 102 cats are plotted against the actual values of the infection dose ( r2=0.73, P<0.001). 3.2.

Inter-animal variability in the model parameters ( E0, E,K) was assumed to be lognormal; the dose of infection and virus strain were evaluated as before as covariates. Onlythe dose of infection, expressed as log 10/mL of CCID50, was nally successfully integrated into the constant expansionrate of CD8 low. With this covariate integration, the objective function was reduced by 33 points, and the variability on the Eparameter decreased by 44%. The mean value of the maximal percentage ( K)w a s estimated at 39.4%. The constant rate of CD8 lowexpansion increases as the dose increases, ranging from 0.08 weeks1 for the lowest dose to 1.62 weeks1for the highest dose. This range is very similar to the range of the rate of increase of viral load. Consequently, we observe that the higher thedose of infection, the stronger the expansion of CD8 low. Notably, we observe a linear relationship between the rate of expansion of the CD8 lowpopulation and the rate of increase of viral load ( Figure 5(a) ).Figure 6 , similarly to Figure 3 , shows model diagnostics with a visual predictive check (Figure 6(a) ) and individual predictions plotted against actual observations ( Figure 6(b) ). Correlations between pre- dictions and observations are fairly good ( r2=0.80, P <0.001), although the highest observations seem to be underestimated by the model. In fact, the proposed model is able to reproduce only the expansion of the CD8 low percentage, whereas in many cases the highest observed CD8lowpercentages were followed by lower percentages at subsequent time points (see Figure 6(a) ). The latter observation might be attributable to technical variability in8 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine performing the laboratory measurements or to fluctuations around a saturation point. 4. Discussion FIV is a major pathogen a ecting cats and is recognized as a relevant model for the study of HIV infection. In particular, during the primary infection phase, the clinical signs and virus localization in FIV-infected cats have been shown to be similar to those observed in HIV infection [ 1]. The study of primary HIV infection is likely to shed new light on the development of the disease, as a relationship has been shown to exist between the characteristics of acute-stage HIV infection and progression to death due to AIDS [ 19,20]. As primary infection in HIV might be di cult to document, the study of the early phase of FIV infection could be an alternative means of gaining insights into HIV that mightcontribute to the design of new e cient therapy. In addition to being a valuable model for HIV , FIV on its own constitutes an important research interest. As a result of the growing prevalence and severity of FIV infection, aneective FIV vaccine is greatly needed in veterinary medicine [2]. The issues that researchers have faced in the process of FIV vaccine development are similar to those encountered for HIV , and it is believed that e ective vaccines against HIV and against FIV will elicit cellular immune responses [ 21- 24]. We performed a longitudinal analysis of important markers of FIV\u2014that is, viral load and CD8 lowper- centage\u2014in cats undergoing primary infection. The analysis was carried out retrospectively, using data from cats that were infected in an experimental protocol. This analysis led us to propose two phenomenological models that correctly reproduced the time-evolution of CD8lowpercentage and viremia during primary FIV infec- tion in cats. These simple models allowed us to integrate, at the level of the parameters, the intersubject variability thatoften characterizes preclinical and clinical data. Expansion of CD8 lowpercentage was modelled with aG o m p e r t zl a w ,a n dv i r e m i aw a sm o d e l l e du s i n gt w o exponential laws to reproduce the initial burst of viral load followed by decay. All model parameters were estimatedwith low-standard errors, and, as expected, variability was elevated for some of the parameters. Even if the models are phenomenological, some of the parameters, and in particular the rate of expansion of the CD8 lowpopulation and viral load, can be easily related to the shapes of thecurves (see Figure 2 for illustration), and so can be easily interpreted. The dose of infection, expressed as log 10/mL of CCID50, was found to be a relevant covariate of the rateof expansion of the CD8 lowpopulation and the rate of increase of viral load; this covariate explains a large part (up to 30%) of the inter-animal variability on the distribution of these two parameters. Finally, the rate of expansion of viral load and the rate of expansion of CD8 lowpercentagewere observed to be correlated ( r2=0.73, P<0.001; see Figure 5(b) ). Obviously, this correlation does not provide any clues regarding the mechanism of action of CD8 low or the relationship between the CD8+T-cell subpopulation and viremia, but it reinforces the prevalent hypothesis that CD8lowpercentage is a relevant marker of FIV progression. The results we obtained with the proposed models may provide insight into the time course of viremia or viralload and the size of the CD8 lowpopulation following infection. Our study points to phenomenological modelsas a potentially valuable complement to the numerousmechanistic models used to study HIV infection and AIDSprogression. For example, researchers have identied a linearrelationship between a patient's viral load, taken as theaverage of all the patient's viral load measurements (allegedlycompatible with the concept of a viral set point), and hisor her survival time [ 25,26]. Our study provides evidence that disease progression in patients can be well described bya simple phenomenological model that does not rely on anybiological assumptions. The dynamic approach we adoptedhere could provide insights into the link between viremia andpatient survival [ 26]. Indeed, the analysis of the time course of viral load might be a better predictor of survival than theaverage viral load parameter used by Arnaout et al. [ 25]. 5. Summary Cats infected with the feline immunodeciency virus (FIV) develop an acquired immunodeciency syndrome (AIDS),similarly to humans infected with HIV . FIV infection causesan acute viremia, which decreases after several weeks, andthe appearance of a subpopulation of activated CD8 +Tc e l l s that we refer to as CD8 lowcells. The expansion of this activated T-cell population is recognized as an importantmarker of FIV infection and disease. Characterization ofthe CD8 lowpopulation's complex pattern of expansion, including its correlation with other disease markers such asviral load, is likely to increase researchers' understandingof FIV infection and AIDS pathogenesis. We propose mathematical equations to analyzethe time-evolution of CD8 lowpopulation size and of viral load during primary infection in cats with FIV . We developthe models using a population approach and mixed-e ects regression techniques, based on repeated measurements inmore than 100 cats infected with FIV .

Molecular dynamics simulations have to be su ciently long to draw reliable conclusions. However, no method exists to prove that a simulation has converged. We suggest the method of \"lagged RMSD-analysis\" as a tool to judge if an MD simulation has not yet run long enough. The analysis is based on RMSD values between pairs of congurations separated by variable time intervals t. Unless RMSD( t) has reached a stationary shape, the simulation has not yet converged. 1. Introduction Mathematical modeling and computational biology have proved extremely successful in the e orts to understand the mechanisms of immunologic reactions, for example, in mod-eling the T-cell proliferation dynamics following hepatitis C,HIV infection [ 1], or the growth of an immunogenic tumor [2]. Methods of statistical mechanics may successfully be applied in order to quantitatively understand the immune system [ 3,4], and di erent modeling approaches are ade- quate for acquired immunity, as surveyed in a seminal paperby Perelson and Weisbush [ 5]. Modeling and simulation can be performed on di erent levels, starting at the top level with agent-based models [ 6,7] for the cooperation of numerous large biomolecules in the formation of theimmune synapse [ 8-11] down to more detailed models of antigen binding [ 12], recognition, and signaling [ 13-20]. T-cell proliferation modulated by interleukin 2 has beensimulated [ 21]. Applications aiming to predict the reaction to epitopes [ 22] improved vaccine design [ 23], vaccinationa g a i n s tt u m o r s[ 24], and for improved patient care have been devised [ 25-27], also in personalized medicine [ 28]. In particular, the mechanisms how T-cell receptors (TCRs)detect antigen peptides (p) presented by major histocom-patibility complex (MHC) molecules can be investigatedby molecular dynamics (MD) on a molecular or evenatomic level [ 29-32]. However, TCRpMHC complexes are huge protein complexes, which have to be studied in water,which adds an even larger number of atoms to model andsimulate. For these reasons, su ciently long simulations are mandatory in order to obtain realistic results. This iseven more so since molecular recognition phenomena mayoperate on rather long timescales as compared to the lengthof usual MD trajectories. Hence, e orts to assess sampling quality are mandatory in such simulations. Given the trajectory of an actual MD simulation, it is clear from rst principles that no formal check whatsoevercan prove that complete sampling has been achieved. Ifparts of the phase space have not been visited yet, thereis no possibility that this becomes evident from looking2 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91RMSD (nm) 02468 1 0 1 2 Time (ns) Figure 1: RMSD as a function of time for trajectory 1 (10 ns).

Note that the RMSD between the reference conguration and itself is zero by denition. only at data from those other parts that have been visited. Zhang et al. [ 33] proposed a formal approach to decompose the phase space into Voronoi polyhedra [ 34,35]. At any rate, formal checks of sampling quality can only draw on simulation data already produced and at the most detect possible shortcomings of those trajecto- ries. The situation is analogous to tests for the random-ness of pseudorandom-number generators [ 36]. One can never prove randomness as such. It is only possible todetect specic deviations from randomness, such as serialcorrelations\u2014and any such detection works only with apreselected error rate. Likewise, MD trajectories may be investigated for specic markers of nonrandomness, the most important type beingtrends of energy and molecular deformations. This workfocuses on the latter, deviations in shape being quantied viathe root mean square deviation (RMSD) [ 37]a tt i m e t 2with respect to a given reference structure at time t1: RMSD (t1,t2)= 1 NN/summationdisplay i=1/bardblxi(t2) xi(t1)/bardbl2 1/2 , xi(t) is the position of atom iat timetandNis the total number of atoms in the molecule.

RMSD monitored this way shows large rapid fluctuationson top of long-term variations and jumps. Generally, it isdicult to identify such long-term variations, which mayrelate to functional modes. A recent study [ 38] reflected the insuciency of visual RMSD inspection alone. Extensive work has been published on using the RMSD for the characterization of structural changes, drifts, andtrends; see [ 33] and the references cited therein. Grosseld and Zuckerman [ 39] gives a seminal conceptual discussion of ergodicity, absolute and relative convergence and proposes checks for overall sampling quality. Block averaging wasproposed [ 40] to reduce short-term fluctuations and to obtain more reliable indicators of long-term trends. How-ever, averaging RMSD over all congurations within a blockinvolves many di erent time intervals t =tjti,t h u s reducing the specicity of the resulting average for oneparticular time interval. For this reason we consider the RMSD between pairs of congurations separated by a constant time lag tas described in Section 2.2.1 . In this way we obtain more stable estimates (averages) which are nevertheless perfectly specicfor a given time interval t. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Molecular Dynamics Simulations 2.1.1. Employed Structures. We applied the proposed metho- dology to a total of 6 MD simulations. For this purposewe used 2 di erent TCRpMHC complexes: with a less immunogenic mutant peptide. Weemployed the crystal structure of the LC13 TCR boundto HLA-B 08 : 01 and the Epstein Barr Virus peptide FLRGRAYGL. This structure is available from the ProteinData Bank (PDB) [ 41] via PDB accession code 1mi5 [ 42] and is referred to as wild-type. For the mutant complex wesubstituted the side chain of tyrosine at position 7 of thepeptide to alanine (Y7A). This was performed using SCWRL[43] since we could previously show that this tool is most appropriate for mutations in pMHC complexes [ 44,45]. The LC13 TCR in complex with the FLRGRAYGL peptide and HLA-B 08 : 01 is an ideal test set for molecular dynamics simulations since this complex was crystallized and describedin its parts and as a whole. Initially Kjer-Nielsen et al.crystallized the TCR [ 46] and the MHC [ 47] separately while they published a structure of the whole TCRpMHC system[42] afterwards. These available data give substantial insight into the LC13/EBV/HLA-B 08 : 01 system and led to the choice of our wild-type and mutated system for this study. The whole system is illustrated in Figure 2 . 2.1.2. Molecular Dynamics Simulation Protocol. The wild- type and the mutant complex were simulated in independentruns for 10, 50, and 200 ns yielding a total of 6 simulations(see Table 1 ). The following protocol for the simulations was employed. First, we minimized the energy of the systemsusing a steepest descent method. Then we immersed thecomplexes in explicit SPC [ 48] articial water baths allowing for a minimal distance of 2 nm between the box boundaryand the protein. Next, we warmed the complex up toComputational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 3 Table 1: Molecular dynamics simulation runs. tmax(ns)tcong (ps) Peptide n Trajectory 1 10 3 FLRGRAYGL 3500 Trajectory 2 1000 Trajectory FLRGRAYGL 4322 Trajectory 4 3 FLRGRAAGL 3500Trajectory 5 FLRGRAAGL 1000 Trajectory 6 200 50 FLRGRAAGL 4322 Figure 2: Illustration of the LC13 TCR in 310 K using position restraints. Finally, we carried out the simulations using GROMACS 4 [ 49] and the GROMOS96 force eld [ 50]. All further parameters were set in accordance with [ 51]. 2.1.3. RMSD Calculation. After the simulations were n- ished, we calculated the RMSD values for each congurationin a given trajectory with respect to every other congurationof the same trajectory using the standard g rms function of GROMACS. This yields an n\u00d7nmatrix of RMSD values wherenis the of RMSD between Congurations of Trajectories 2.2.1. Averaging and Modeling of Lagged RMSD. Given one conguration x(ti) of an MD simulation as a reference, the R M S Dt os o m eo t h e rc o n g u r a t i o n x(tj) may be considered a \"distance measure\" along the time interval t=tjti.I ft is short enough, it may be shifted along the whole trajectoryand RMSD values be sampled. The average RMSD(t) is characteristic for the di erence between congurations separated by tin the particular simulation run considered. Small values of tcharacterize congurations close to each other in time. Increasing tmeans to compare congurations more distant to each other in time, whichare\u2014intuitively speaking\u2014\"less related\" to each other. This fact should be reflected in RMSD(t) for increasing values of t. Astincreases, dependences should diminish and approach the level of \"unrelated\" or \"independent\" cong-urations. In order to quantify such a saturation trend, we applied the Hill equation [52]: RMSD (t)=a\u00b7t ty+t, (2) where the parameter areflects the to which the function is asymptotic (\"plateau value\" RMSD(t )),is the e . , the value tfor half-saturation is achieved), and theHill coe cientis a parameter that determines the shape, that is, the level of sigmoidicity, of the model functions. Theparameters were estimated by tting the Hill equation (2) to the measured values of RMSD(t) using the nlint fun- ction as implemented in the Statistics Toolbox of MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). The maximum time lag t was chosen half the total simulation time of the respectivetrajectory. 2.2.2. Assessing the Influence of Initial Conditions. The initial phaset tosetof each MD simulation strongly depends on the starting conguration, usually a crystal structure,which can by no means be representative for a congurationobtained from a trajectory. This is even true after energyminimization and warming up. Hence, if the initial phase ofan MD trajectory is included in RMSD(t), a bias will result. This is not only true for individual values of RMSD(t)b u t also for the parameters estimated from the t. In particular,the limiting plateau value a =RMSD(t= ) will also be biased and depend on toset:i nf a c t ,a=a(toset). We modeled this dependence as a(toset)=a0+\u00b7exp(\u00b7toset), (3) wherea0is the limiting value, a0=a(toset= ), and andare scaling parameters. Note that a0is an extrapolated estimate for RMSD(t= )a n dtoset= , that is, the estimate for an RMSD between two totally unrelatedcongurations of a trajectory, independent of initial phaseeects. Values for t osetwere selected in the interval 0 toset tmax/2, where tmaxdenotes the total simulation time of the respective trajectory. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Convergence of RMSD with Increasing Time Lag. Each panel of Figure 3 shows a representative plot (for reasons of conciseness we display results in the gures only fortrajectory 1-3) of mean RMSD values (red circles, obtained between congurations of one MD trajectory (seegure caption and Table 1 ), separated by respective time lags t(x-axis). As the time-lag between congurations increases, mean RMSD approaches a plateau.4 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91Mean RMSD (nm) 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 Time-lag t(ns) (a)00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91Mean RMSD (nm) 0 RMSD (nm) 0 1 02 03 06 07 0 9 0 80 100 Time-lag t(ns) (c) Figure 3: Dependence of mean RMSD on the time lag tfortoset=0.

Note that due to the di erent total durations of the simulations, the maximum time lag considered (equal to half the simulation length) varies. Vertical lines indicate the time interval , for which half-saturation is achieved; see also ( 2). The horizontal line indicates the estimated plateau of the mean RMSD, corresponding to the parameter ain (2). Fits of the model ( 2) to the values of RMSD(t)a r e displayed as solid lines. Parameters obtained from the tscan readily be interpreted as follows. The estimate forparameter ain (2) represents the limiting value of RMSD(t) and is indicated by the horizontal line. The estimate ofthe parameter corresponds to a \"characteristic\" (\"half- saturation\") time interval tand is shown as a vertical line in the plots. Note that the initial phase of each trajectory strongly determines the shape of RMSD(t) which should be properly represented by the tted model. In contrast, theremainder of each trajectory is characteristic for the long-term trend of RMSD(t). Although it shows much smaller changes in RMSD, the remainder contains naturally by farmore data points as compared to the initial phase. T o achieve an appropriate balance, we increased the lag length in small steps during an initial phase (cf. the initially dense successionof red circles in Figure 3 ) and in larger steps (more loose succession of circles) later on. This procedure puts increasedweight on the data points for the initial phase. 3.2. Influence of the O set. Applying di erent temporal o - setst osetbefore starting to analyze the respective trajectories changes the dependence of RMSD(t) as a function of the time lagt; see the typical results displayed in Figure 4 . The larger the o settosetfrom the start conguration, the smaller the time lag tnecessary for the system to level o to its RMSD plateau. The exemplary display of the dependence of tted parameters on toset, as shown previously, is systematically analyzed as follows; see Figure 5 . With increasing tosetboth the plateau value aand the half-saturation parameter tdecrease, whereas the shapeComputational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 5 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91Mean RMSD (nm) 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 Time-lag t(ns) (a)00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91Mean RMSD (nm) 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 Time-lag t(ns) (b) Figure 4: Dependence of mean RMSD on tosetfor trajectory 1 (10 ns).

Figures 6(a)-6(c) illustrates the influence of the o set t osetfrom the start conguration on the respective RMSD plateau values as estimated from the parameter aof the model ( 2).RMSD plateau values tend to decrease with increasing toset. 4. Conclusions For molecular dynamics simulations of proteins, questions of \"convergence\" and sampling are important issues if sensibleconclusions are to be drawn from such simulations. Sinceconvergence of a particular simulation (in the sense thatstatistical sampling of the phase space is complete enoughwith respect to the specic phenomena studied) cannot bejudged in advance [ 39], various techniques have been advised to demonstrate that a simulation has not yet converged [37,53-56]. Here, we propose a method to assess if a simulation has not yet run long enough, based on RMSD analysis of successive congurations of a given MD trajectory,separated by time lags tof varying length (up to half the total simulation time). As long as a simulation has notyet converged, the shape of the function RMSD(t)s t i l l considerably depends on toset, that is, the time point along the trajectory, where the analysis interval tstarts. As tosetis large enough, the shape of RMSD(t) becomes stationary; that is, in Figure 4 the shape of the mean RMSD curve is dierent in the left and right panel, but further increasingtosetwould not further change its overall appearance. This is also reflected in the respective model parameters, convergingto constant values for large values of t oset;s e e Figure 5 . T o describe this tdependence of the mean RMSD values, RMSD(t), for a given toset, the Hill function was used. This function type is frequently applied in enzymekinetics to model saturation phenomena together with thenumber of reactive sites on an enzyme. In the presentwork, the Hill function proved flexible enough to modelthe functional form of RMSD(t) and to identify the respective parameters (plateau value, shape parameter, andhalf-saturation time). Contrary to a simple exponentialsaturation function, the Hill function is able to modeldierent levels of sigmoidicity. In order to quantify the influence of the initial conditions and the equilibration phase on RMSD(t), we systematically increased the time tosetbefore starting to analyze each trajectory. With the exception of the shape parameter all the other parameters of the Hill function describing RMSD(t) exhibit a distinctive dependence on the initial phase of the trajectories and thus indicate that biased estimates wouldresult if the initial phase would be included in the analysis. As pointed out in the introduction, the method proposed here combines the smoothing e ect of averaging, while retaining the specicity of a precise time interval betweencongurations being compared. For example, the heightof the extrapolated RMSD plateau a0(see Figure 6 )m a y be interpreted as \"congurational distance\" between twoarbitrarily selected, totally unrelated congurations of theparticular part of phase space currently visited. If onechooses an arbitrary conguration out of it as the reference,all others visited by the trajectory will have an averagedistancea 0. In contrast, Figure 1 shows two limiting cases of reference congurations: (i) the conguration with maxi-mum average distance (i.e., RMSD) to all others (blue curve),6 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91Fit parameter 0 1 2 3 4 56 toset(ns) (a)00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91Fit parameter 0 5 10 15 20 25 toset(ns) (b) 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91Fit parameter 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 toset(ns) a(nm) /10 (ns) (c) Figure 5: Increasing tosetchanges tted parameters of RMSD(t), (2).

Note that extrapolated plateau values are signicantly larger than the RMSD(t) actually reached in the trajec- tories (see Figure 3 ). Only if we consider the extrapolated plateau as a function of toset, we obtain realistic (i.e., lower) estimates (see Figure 6 ) to aim at during actual simulations. In this sense, we may attribute the proposedtting procedure some forecast capability regarding the levelof RMSD to be nally expected if the trajectory were carriedon. This extrapolated mean RMSD corresponds to pairsof congurations separated by time intervals large enoughto consider such congurations approximately uncorrelated,independent representatives of the conguration space of the respective molecule. Likewise, the \"half-saturation time\" obtained from the t decreases with increasing t oset. Thus, taking congura- tions with large enough tosetas a reference, it takes only a short time to get close to the RMSD plateau a0.I ne a c h panel of Figure 5 , the parameter approaches an almost constant level at about half the maximum tosetconsidered (i.e., 25% of the total simulation time). This might suggestthat\u2014regardless of the total simulation length\u2014the fractionof usable (independent) congurations remains the same(nal 75% of the trajectory). As the length of the simulationrun increases, the criterion derived from the run itself getsincreasingly more stringent. From the 200 ns run the rst50 ns should be discarded, which is more than 5 times theComputational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 7 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91RMSD plateau (nm) 012345 toset(ns) (a)00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91RMSD plateau (nm) 15 toset(ns) (b) 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91RMSD plateau (nm) 0 2 04 06 08 0 1 0 0 toset(ns) (c) Figure 6: Fit and extrapolation of RMSD plateau values for increasing toset.

From the latter t the limiting plateau value a0=a(toset= )w a se x t r a c t e d and is shown as a solid horizontal line together with its asymptotic standard error as obtained from the t of ( 3). total length of the 10 ns trajectory. If using the latter as a basis of estimate, however, the last 7.5 ns seem to be trustable. Although the analysis reported in the present work is specic to TCRpMHC complexes, we expect the method oflagged RMSD analysis to be applicable to similar molecularsystems, such as membrane proteins comparable in sizeand structure. The approach presented here is designed toassess the degree of convergence of MD simulations andhence the statistical quality of conclusions drawn from suchsimulations.

The immune system is able to respond more vigorously to the se cond contact with a given antigen than to the rst contact. Vaccination protocols generally include at least two doses, in order to obtain high antibody titers. We want to analyze the relationbetween the time elapsed from the rst dose (priming) and the second dose (boost) on the antibody titers. In this paper, we couple in vivo experiments with computer simulations to assess the e ect of delaying the second injection. We observe that an interval of several weeks between the prime and the boost is necessary to obtain optimal antibody responses. 1. Introduction Immunological memory, dened as the capacity of the immune system to respond more vigorously to the secondcontact with a given antigen than to the rst contact, is thebasis of the persistent protection a orded by the resolution of some infections and is the goal of vaccination. Memory isa system-level property of the immune system, which arisesfrom the increase in the frequency of antigen specic B andT cells as well as from the di erentiation of antigen specic lymphocytes into memory cells, which are able to respondfaster to antigen and to self-renew [ 1-3]. The protection a orded by vaccines currently in use correlates well with the magnitude of the antibody response.The persistence of antigen-specic antibody titers over aprotective threshold and the ability to exhibit a \"recall re-sponse\" to eencounter with antigen have long been the onlymeasurable correlates of vaccine \"take\" and immune mem-ory. However, these methods for the evaluation of immunememory su er from the disadvantage of relying on long- term monitoring of the immune response. Thus, optimizingthe vaccination schedule to obtain high and persistingantibody titers, an important step in the development of novel vaccines and immunotherapies, is a long trial and errorprocess [ 4,5]. The magnitude of the immune response can usually be increased by multiple administrations of vaccine; the notableexception being represented by virus-vectored vaccines andwhereby immunity to the viral capsid induced by the rstdose prevents cell infection by subsequent doses. When a new prototype vaccine is tested for the rst time in vivo , the injection schedule is designed empirically, using a combination of immunological knowledge, previousexperience, and practical constraints, and it is renedon the basis of the observed immunological responsesand protection. However, in vivo experimentation poses practical limits to the number of di erent immunization schedules that can be tried to nd the protocol thatmaximizes the antibody titer, while minimizing the numberof doses. Thus, in silico simulations of the kinetics of the antibody response can be useful to generate predictions,that can then be tested experimentally, and to generatenovel hypotheses on early correlates of immune mem-ory.2 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine The vaccine used to generate the experimental data reported in this study and described in Section 2 ,n a m e l y - ( 1 - 11)E2, consists of \"virus-like particles\" formed by a domainof the bacterial protein E2 is able to self-assemble intoa 60-mer peptide [ 6]. Each particle displays on its surface 60 copies of peptide \"DAEFRHDSGYE, \" corresponding to the rst 11 N-terminal residues of beta-amyloid, a peptide that forms aggregates in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. A single \"prime\" dose of the (1-11)E2 vaccine induces measurable titers of anti-beta-amyloid antibodies in alltreated mice, and in 4/5 mice that received a \"boost\" dose 6months later, we observed a clear memory response, namely,a fast rise of anti-beta-amyloid antibody titers to a peakserum concentration between 1 and 7 mg/mL. Studies performed in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease have demonstrated that antibodiesagainst beta-amyloid are able to reduce plaques and improvecognition (reviewed in [ 7-10]. In mouse models as well as in clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease patients, induction of ahigh titer of anti-beta-amyloid antibodies correlates with thetherapeutic e cacy of vaccination [ 10,11]. In this study, the e ect of the time delay between the rst and the second injection of antigen on the peak antibodytiter is explored in an computer model of the immune systemresponse. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals. BALB/c mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratory, Italy. Ethics Committee of the institution withinwhich the work was undertaken have approved the protocolsinvolving mice and these conform to the provisions of theDeclaration of Helsinki and Italian National Guidelines foranimal use in research. 2.2. Generation of Virus-Like Particles cloned into the with NcoI andXmaI, to obtain plasmid pET(1-11)E2. Successful construc-tion was conrmed by DNA sequence analysis.(1-11)E2 VLP was produced and characterized as previouslydescribed [ 5]. 2.3. Immunizations. Mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 200L of a 1 : 1 mixture of antigen and adjuvant. Com- plete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) was used in the rst injection,and Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) in the second one.Each mouse received an amount of antigen carrying 6 go f the beta-amyloid epitope. Blood was collected at indicatedtime points, and ELISA was performed on serum. 2.4. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). We l ls of a 96-well Nunc Immunoplate were coated with streptavidinat 37 C over night until complete evaporation. Wells were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in 20 mM TrisHClpH 7.3, mM incubated with 50 ng 0.25% bovine mM TrisHCl pH 7.3, 0.5 20, with anti-mouse IgG peroxidaseconjugate (SIGMA A-2554). All incubations were carried out for 1 hr at 37 C, and after each step wells were washed twice with Elisa wash bu er (EWB) (20 mM TrisHCl pH 7.3, 130 mM NaCl, 0.05% T ween 20) and once with Tris bu ered saline (TBS) (20 mM TrisHCl pH 7.3, 0.5 M NaCl). Wells were incubated for 45 min atroom temperature with 0.4 mg mL 1O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride dissolved in 30 mM citric acid, 4,0 . Absorbance was read at 492 nm, after blocking color development was blocked with 0.8 Msulfuric acid. Each serum was tested against synthetic peptides 1-11 of beta-amyloid (the synthetic peptide 23-29 of beta-amyloidwas used as a negative control). Titer of a serum was denedas the highest dilution yielding an absorbance value equalto twofold of the background value obtained against anirrelevant antigen. 2.5. The Computational Model. The in silico experiments are performed by a computational model of the immune system[12] that uses binary strings to represent the binding site of cells and molecules (i.e., lymphocytes receptors, BCRs,TCRs, Major Histocompatibility Complexes MHC, antigenpeptides and epitopes, immunocomplexes IC, etc.). The model is based on the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm, in that all entities are individually represented[13,14] as in cellular automata models [ 15]. It includes the major classes of cells of the lymphoid lineage, that is,T helper lymphocytes, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, B lympho-cytes, antibody-producer plasma cells, and natural killer cells(NK) and some of the myeloid lineage, that is, macrophages(M) and dendritic cells (DC). These entities cooperate following a set of algorithms (or logical rules) carrying outthe di erent phases of the immune recognition and response to a generic pathogen. In particular, the model takes intoaccount phagocytosis, antigen presentation, cytokine release,cell activation from inactive or anergic states to active states,cytotoxicity, and antibody secretion. The model simulates asimplied form of innate immunity and a more elaborateform of adaptive immunity, including both humoral andcytotoxic immune responses [ 16]. In the model, a single human lymph node (or a portion of it) is mapped onto a three-dimensional ellipsoid Cartesian lattice. The primary lymphoid organs thymusand bone marrow are modeled apart: the thymus [ 17]i s implicitly represented by the positive and negative selectionof immature thymocytes before they enter into the lymphaticsystem, while the bone marrow generates already mature Blymphocytes. Hence, only immunocompetent lymphocytesare represented on the primary lymphoid organ modeled. This computational model can be seen as a collection of working assumptions or theories, most of which are regardedas established immunological mechanisms. In details, themodel includes: the clonal selection theory of Burnet [ 18]; network theory of Jerne [ 19]; the clonal deletionComputational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 3 Table 1: Biological rules coding for interactions between cells or among cells and molecules and other specic mechanisms of theimmune system. Each of the entries of this list corresponds to an algorithm implementing a specic activity of the immune cells.

These features can be selectively toggled on or o, allowing for general investigations of immunological hypothesis. Moreover, other specic biological processescan be added to the model with relatively little e ort. For example, customizations of the basic model have been usedto simulate di erent phenomena ranging from viral infection (e.g., HIV , EBV [ 26,27]) to type I hypersensitivity [ 28]a n d cancer [ 29,30]. A simulated time step is roughly equivalent to eight hours. The interactions among the cells determine theirfunctional behavior ( Ta bl e 1 ). Interactions are coded as probabilistic rules dening the transition of each cell entity from one state to another. Each interaction requires theinvolved cellular entities to be in a specic state out of aset of possible states (e.g., na \u00a8ve, active, resting, duplicating) that is dependent on the cell type. Once these conditionsare fullled, the interaction is driven by a probability thatis directly related to the e ective level of binding between ligands and receptors. Strings of 0s and 1s are used to represent specicity elements like receptors and other molecular binding speci-cities (see Figure 1 ). The length of this string is specied as a parameter /lscript. Two bit-strings complement each other (or are a perfect match) if every 0 in one corresponds to a 1 inthe other and conversely. More generally, an m-bit match is dened as a pair where exactly mbits complement each other. Therefore, in order to compute the binding probability, werst dene the function h(a,b) giving us the number of matching bits between two strings aandb(i.e., the Hamming distance in the space of the bit-strings). Then, we dene the function (m) as the a nity of an m-bit match. T o ensure that perfect matches prevail over imperfect ones, we set (/lscript) to a high value and (m)( w i t hm</lscript )t ol o w e rv a l u e s .T o specify the vector , one method is to specify it directly by simply listing out its components. Another method uses the additional parameter arguments m, that is, the minimum match allowed, a=(m), that is, the minimum level of anity, and a parameter specifying the gain in a nity proportional to a one bit more match, to calculate in thefollowing way: (i) using the parameter m ,s e t(m)=a whereas for m<m set(m) to 0 (this provides a level below which binding cannot occur); (ii) the increase of strength onincreasing a match by one bit is set to be the inverse of ther a t i oo fn u m b e ro fc l o n e sw i t hm a t c h m+1 andmmultiplied by /parenleftbig/lscript m+1/parenrightbig. (1) This allows to set the lower end value of (m) and the steepness of its increase as the number of matching bits isincremented. It is usually more convenient than supplyingthevector directly. Generally, it is advisable to set m somewhat close to /lscriptbits in order to restrict the range of allowable matches to a few bits, so that the number ofantibodies raised in response to a given antigen remainsmanageable. Unlike the many immunological models, the present one not only simulates the cellular level of the intercellularinteractions but also the intra-cellular processes of antigenuptake and presentation. Both the cytosolic and endocyticpathways are modeled. In the model, endogenous antigenis fragmented and combined with MHC class I moleculesfor presentation on the cell surface to CTLs receptors,whereas the exogenous antigen is degraded into smallerparts (i.e., peptides), which are then bound to MHC classII molecules for presentation to the THs receptors ( Ta bl e 1 ). The a nity among MHC molecules and the antigen peptides is computed in a slightly di erent manner than those between cell receptors and antigenic epitopes. Firstly, thematch is computed over half bit string; secondly, there is nominimum match. The a nity value between two half strings whose match is m,f o ra l lm =0,...,/lscript/2, is dened as (m)=/parenleftbigg1 2/parenrightbigg/lscript/2m . (2) The function (m) represents the probability that a peptide with match mto the MHC molecule binds and is presented alongside with it on the cell surface for subsequent TCRrecognition.

In the gure a T lymphocyte receptor b inds the MHC-peptide complex of an antigen presenting cell. weight molecules, such as interleukins or chemokines, are represented in terms of their concentration. The correspond-ing dynamics is modeled by the following parabolic partialdierential equation that describes a uniform di usion process with the addition of a degradation term that takesinto account the nite half-life of molecules: c t=D2cc+s(x,t), (3) wherec=c(x,t) is the concentration of chemokines, s(x,t)i s the source term, Dis the di usion coe cient, and =ln 2/ whereis the half-life. We D=3000m2/min =3 hrs for all chemokines [ 31,32]. Di erences in cell mobility also are taken into account. TH cells are the fastestwith an average velocity of 11 m/min, followed by B cells with 6m/min and DC with a velocity of 3 m/min [ 32]. The rules listed in Ta bl e 1 are executed for each time step. The stochastic execution of these rules, as in a Monte Carlomethods, produces a logical causal/e ect sequence of events culminating in the immune response and development ofimmunological memory. The starting point of this series ofevents is the injection of antigen (the priming). The system is designed to maintain a steady state of the global population of cells ( homeostasis ) if no infection is applied. This is achieved by modeling the birth/death processas a mean reverting process of the type: dx i(t) dt=log2 i(xi(0)xi(t))+(t), (4) wherexi(t) is the population iat timei,iis the specic half- life parameter, and (t) is a Gaussian random noise. Initially the system is na \u00a8ve in the sense that there are neither TandBmemory cells nor plasma cells and antibodies. The various steps of the simulated immuneresponse depends on what is actually injected, for example,a recombinant virus or bacteria. The model contains a number of parameters whose value has been determined as follows. These parameterscan be classied into three categories: (i) unknown values or free parameters, which are set after a tuning procedurethat begins with an initial estimation of their values anditeratively improves the results of the simulations by smallmodications of the parameters; (ii) parameters that cor-respond to the initial conditions of the system and thatdetermine the problem under investigation; (iii) parameterswhose value is well known and available from immunologyliterature. Given the initial condition represented by the simulated volume determining the number of cells populating the spaceaccording to known leukocyte formulas, the model runsin a metastable state assured by homeostasis. In absenceof antigenic stimulus, the populations of immune cells randomly fluctuates around the average values given. Upon an antigenic challenge performed by injecting a certainamount of a pathogen, the system moves away from themetastable state to recognize the insulting molecules andto mount an immune response that may or not includethe deployment of both the humoral and the cytotoxicartillery. Once the antigen is cleared, the system goes backto an equilibrium state that is not the same as before asit contains a shift in the system specicity amounting tothe immune memory. This memory allows for a faster andstronger reaction to a later encounter of the same (or similar)pathogen. Figure 2 shows this dynamics as an example of a typical immunization experiment consisting in injecting at dayzero and about ten weeks after a generic immunogenicsubstance as a vaccine. The result of the priming is thatthe antigen is cleared in about four days (panel up-left)as the antibodies elicited peak within the second and thethird week (bottom-left panel). The di erent specicities (i.e., binary strings) of the antibodies elicited are shown inthe same gure. The gure also shows (bottom-right andthe titer (up-right panel) consisting of antigen clotted with antibodies.Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 5 0100000200000300000400000500000 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5Antigen count per mL Ab titers MonthsTime scale is 480 minutes per time step Ag AbDays01234567 0500100015002000250030003500400045005000 (a) Arbitrary scale ImmunocomplexesDays050100150200250300350 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0(b)Antibody titers 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0 (c) Cell count Days020406080100120140160180200 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0PLB cell count (cells per mm3) (d) Figure 2: The virtual experiments are conducted priming at day zero and later after a certain time interval. In this case the boost has been performed after about ten weeks. While the antibodies are produced by plasma cells derived by expanding clones of B cells, the injected antigen is cleared and immunocomplexes are formed. The secondary immune response to the boost is stronger and faster than the responseto the priming because of the immunological memory (not shown). Whereas the immunogenicity of the injected substance is the main responsible for the immune response, a secondarybut not less important factor is the timing. Indeed, asanticipated above, the question investigated here is what isthe optimal timing for boosting in terms of higher antibodytiters. Intuitively, one expects a window of optimality since atoo close boost does not elicit a strong memory as it simplyadd, (and compete for resources) to the prime, whereasan overly delayed boost may fail to wake up the memorysimply because it already faded away. Computer simulationsallow to easily broadening the search for the optimality,something that would be costly and time consuming with animal models. 3. V alidating the Model against the Experimental Dataset Before use, the simulator needs to be validated against the specic experimental data available and described inSection 2 . Interestingly, matching experimental data was not straightforward. Indeed, the rst set of simulations did not6 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine Titers (arbitrary scale) Time (aribitrary scale)Antibody titers IC dissociation No Y es and M processing Y es but no M processing Figure 3: Dissociation of immunocomplexes and successive phago- cytosis and presentation by APCs of the antigenic molecules increases vaccine persistence hence increasing the magnitude of theimmune response. yield reasonable t with the data indicating that the model was lacking of some specic mechanism. In particular, the model failed to reproduce a correct kinetic for both antigen clearance and antibody expansion(it goes without saying that the two issues are connected)as we obtained faster than experimentally observed rates.Discussions pointed us to identify a mechanism of vaccinedelivery that was missing in the computational model andcould account for the divergence observed. Therefore, inorder to correct this inconsistency, we implemented twomechanism: (i) one to implement what is called the \"depoteect, \" that is, the gradual release of the vaccine so as to cover a long period of antigen exposure, and (ii) amechanism accounting for immunocomplexes dissociationactually providing a further longer exposition time to theinjected vaccine. The modied model incorporating these two e ects eectively increased the targeted adherence to the exper- imental data. Since the depot e ect resulted in a minor dierence, we show hereafter the e ects of implementing the dissociation of immunocomplexes on the simulation outcome. Note that the overall expected e ect of the antigen- antibody compound dissociation is to have a longer exposi-tion to the antigen and also a better a nity maturation since weak binders have a higher dissociation rate. Specically,the instability of immunocomplexes (ICs) favors re-ingestionof the immunogenic peptides by antigen presenting cells(APCs) and representation to specic lymphocytes, who,on their side, opt for higher a nity ones.

We can see that without IC dissociation, the antibody titers are low compared tothe case of higher antigen-antibody instability whereas theeect of a direct ingestion and following presentation of IC by macrophages does not account for the same big e ect but nevertheless shows that IC ingestion by M actually represents a suboptimal situation compared to the \"neat\" ICdissociation because of the waste of antibodies bound to theantigen in the complexes that are e ectively thrown away by macrophages upon ingestion. After these modications the simulator showed titers that are comparable to that observed in real data. Figure 4 show the t with mice data calculated as average of four miceexperiments. Error bars show the standard deviation of IgGantibodies receiving a vaccine priming at day zero and a boost six months later. The solid line in Figure 3 show a good agreement of the simulated mice with the experimentaldata. This data set allowed to ne tune the parameters of the simulator. Further experiments have been performedafterwards to investigate the relationships among the prime-boost time distance and the magnitude of the immuneresponse measured as IgG antibody titers. This is show in thenext section. 4. Results In order to investigate the relationship between the interdosedelay and the immune response, we have performed a set ofvirtual experiments by running the simulation with di erent initial conditions. In particular, we injected the antigen attime step t 1=0 and successively at t2.W ep e r f o r m e d simulations for Ttime steps, corresponding to about T/3Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 7 15 3045 50 75 90 115 130 145 160 175190 205 220 235 250 265280 295IgG: peak value after second injection Days of second injectionMax Ig (arbitrary scale) 2e+064e+066e+068e+06 (a)15 30455075 90 115 130 145 160 175190 205 220 235 250 265280 295Days of second injectionMax Ig (arbitrary scale)IgG: peak value after rst injection 0e+001e+062e+063e+064e+06 (b) Figure 5: The lower panel shows that m1is trivially independent oft2whereas the upper panel showing m2tells that, overall, there exists an optimal timing for the boost that is greater than 45 days. days of real life. The delay t=t2t1is the free variable of the experiment, whereas the outcome is the di erences in the amount of antibodies produced to the prime and the boostvaccination. More specically, we call ab(t) the antibody titers at time t,m 1=max{ab(t):t1[t1,t2)}the maximum level ofabrelative to the injection of antigens at time t0(i.e., the prime injection), and analogously m2=max{ab(t): t[t2,T]}the maximum level of IgG antibodies relative to the injection of antigens at time t2(i.e., the boost injection). We can assume that m1m2since the injected antigen is the same for the two injections and, therefore, the immunememory is such that the second immune response is fasterand stronger than the rst [ 33,34]. We cal l ab=m2m1the di erences in the peak values of antibody titers during the two responses.

The same information is better displayed in Figure 6 that plotsab(t) as a function of t=t2. In particular, an interval of several weeks between the prime and the boost is necessaryto obtain an optimal humoral response, as hypothesized andreported in experimental studies. Indeed, when the boostis given in the rst month after the prime, the di erence between the peaks of the secondary and primary responses,that is a measure of the e ciency of the boost, is quite low. The boost e ciency increases when the second dose is given 45 to 90 days after the prime, whereas further delaying theboost does not improve the secondary antibody peak. 5. Discussion Optimizing prime-boost regimens is key to developingnovel vaccines. What is the optimal time for boosting isa fundamental question that remains unanswered [ 4]. It has been suggested that an interval of at least 2-3 monthsbetween the prime and the boost is necessary to obtainoptimal responses, as memory T cells with high proliferativepotential do not form until several weeks after the rstimmunization, and memory Bcells have to go through the germinal center reaction and take several months to develop [4]. Immunization schedules are designed empirically and are then rened on the basis of the observed immunolog-ical responses and protection. In some instances, di erent countries that implement the same vaccine in their nationalimmunization programs use di erent schedules [ 35,36]. The United States Advisory Committee on Immuniza- tion Practices (ACIP) publishes each year a recommendedimmunization schedules for licensed vaccines, to reflectcurrent recommendations [ 37,38]. For individuals whose vaccinations have been delayed, catch up schedules andminimum intervals between doses are indicated [ 37]. For most vaccines currently in use, the minimum recommended8 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine interval between dose 1 and dose 2, for children, is 4 weeks, however, for some vaccines a minimum interval of 8 weeks,3 months, or 6 months is recommended [ 37]. In preclinical experimentation of prototype vaccines, on the other hand, shorter intervals between doses are oftenused, to obtain a rapid rise in antibody titers above protective values. In the case of vaccination against beta-amyloid in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, a schedule that hasbeen used with a variety of prototype vaccines involvesdoses at day 0, 2 weeks and 4 weeks, and monthly dosesthereafter. When multiple doses are administered within ashort timeframe, understanding the contribution of eachdose to the peak antibody titer can be practically impossible. In this study we have analyzed the e ect of the interval between prime and boost injection on the antibody responsein a computational model of the immune system. We have shown that in the computational model an interval of several weeks between the prime and the boostis necessary to obtain optimal responses, as hypothesizedand reported for real immune responses. In particular, in thesimulations, when the boost is given in the rst month afterthe prime, the di erence between the peaks of the secondary and primary responses, our measure of the e ciency of the boost, is low. The boost e ciency increases when the second dose is given 45 to 90 days after the prime, whereas furtherdelaying the boost does not improve the secondary antibodypeak (simulations of boosts administered up to 300 days afterthe prime are shown in Figure 6 ). Thus, the computational model displays the qualitative features of real immune responses, and it can be useful to understand which component of the immune system is in charge for the time-dependent di erences in boost e cacy that are observed in vivo . Interestingly, the e cacy of the boost does not parallel the number of T helper cells and Bcells. In the model, the number of T and B cells increases afterthe prime, as cells are activated and duplicate. Cell numbersthen decline, as a consequence of cell death. Thus, at day 15there are more T or B cells than at day 90. Interestingly, alsomemory T cells are more abundant at the 15 and 45 timepoint than at later time points, revealing that the better mem-ory response obtained at later time points is not correlated tohigher numbers of memory T cell. On the contrary, the boostis optimal at a time point when the populations generated bythe prime, in particular, activated cells, duplicating cells, andalso memory cells, have all contracted. The T and B cells thatare present in the system at late time points after the primeare qualitatively di erent from earlier cells. It is important here to emphasize that, in the model, a memory cell is acell that, having been activated by antigen, has increasedits average lifespan. Further encounters with antigen lead tofurther increases in the lifespan. Thus, memory cells are notall equal in their proliferative potential, and the memory ofthe system matures over time, as cells with high proliferativecapacity are generated. This model, therefore, demonstrates that cell populations dynamics, and a simple assumption, namely the fact that a \"survival signal\" is received bymemory cells at each encounter with antigen, are su cient to reproduce the need for an optimal delay between primeand boost, observed in vivo.On the other hand, di erent vaccines are known to have di erent requirements with respect to the minimum interval between doses. The simulations reported in thisstudy refer to a \"generic vaccine, \" and the time scales thatwere obtained, which are quite realistic, anyway do not referto a specic vaccine, although parameters have been set to t data obtained with a nonreplicating protein antigen, namely, virus-like particle (1-11)E2 (6). The computational modelcan be useful to explore the role of di erent features of the primary response on the optimal time point for boost, andon boost e ciency, at a set time point. A deeper analysis of the overall system dynamics is currently underway to pinpoint which immune componentis in charge for the observed behavior and will be publishedin due course. Furthermore, vaccine specicities like thenumber of peptides are likely to play a distinct role the questoptimality and therefore they have to be incorporated in thecomputer model as well.

A major challenge in immunology is how to translate data into knowledge given the inherent complexity and dynamics of human physiology. Both the physiology and engineering communities have rich histories in applying computational approachesto translate data obtained from complex systems into knowledge of system behavior. However, there are some di erences in how disciplines approach problems. By referring to mathematical mo dels as mathematical prototypes, we aim to highlight aspects related to the process (i.e., prototyping) rather than the product (i.e., the model). The objective of this paper is to review how tworelated engineering concepts, specically prototyping and \"tness for use,\" can be applied to overcome the pressing challenge in translating data into improved knowledge of basic immunology that can be used to improve therapies for disease. These concepts are illustrated using two immunology-related examples. The prototypes presented focus on the beta cell mass at the onset of type1 diabetes and the dynamics of dendritic cells in the lung. This paper is intended to illustrate some of the nuances associated withapplying mathematical modeling to improve understanding of the dynamics of disease progression in humans. 1. Introduction One of the great challenges in the eld of health science is understanding how to integrate the knowledge obtainedabout individual molecules and cells to predict integratedsystem behavior [ 1]. Advances in the techniques associ- ated with molecular biology during the twentieth centuryprovided immense insight into the individual componentsof complex biological systems. Integration of this newtechnology has also changed the nature of immunologicalresearch\u2014from static single measurements to large-scaledata-intensive assays obtained at multiple time points. Ashighlighted in Figure 1, research costs associated with these new techniques have escalated dramatically, but thecommercialization rate of new therapeutic products has beenunable to keep pace [ 2]. This increasing disconnect betweencost and commercialization also corresponds to a growing awareness of the need to improve understanding of howthe identied biological parts function together in biologicalsystems and how dysfunction manifests itself as disease [ 3,4]. Historically, engineering is an applied eld in which knowledge of how components of a system work, whichis obtained through basic research, is synthesized intocommercially viable products and processes. A fundamentalpillar in this eld is the use of computational frameworks forinterpreting and predicting the behavior of complex systems [6]. These computational frameworks integrate fragmented knowledge and enable one to explore novel experimentalconditions, as a type of in silico screening. By recreating areal system in silico, the predictive power of the simulation(or lack thereof) may be used to infer hidden componentsor unknown relationships among existing ones.

Research and development spending by the United Statespharmaceutical industry has escalated dramatically during the last several decades (solid line\u2014left axis) [ 5]. However, the translation of this increased research spending into new therapeutic products,as represented by the number of new medical entities (NMEs) approved by the Food and Drug Administration (circles\u2014right axis), has failed to keep pace [ 2]. can provide value to the drug development process by translating observations of the state of a system, that is,experimental data, into quantitative knowledge about howbiological systems work. In particular, this approach can aidin understanding the implications of dynamic relationshipamong biological components of a system and can identifyknowledge gaps in the collective understanding of a biologi-cal system. Interestingly, parallels can be drawn between the devel- opment of the modern experimental techniques of molecularbiology and the advances in experimental chemistry duringthe middle part of the 20th century. These advances inexperimental chemistry were critical driving forces for theemergence of modern chemical engineering [ 7]. During this period, modern chemical engineering played a central rolein developing computational tools that helped transformchemistry from a qualitative into a predictive science. Morerecently, chemical engineering is evolving to incorporatemolecular biology as another enabling science, in additionto physics and chemistry [ 8]. Our increased ability to probe the molecular basis for cellular response provides an intrigu-ing context for applying engineering principles, such asthermodynamics, transport phenomena, chemical kinetics, and multiscale analysis. From the biology perspective, the National Research Council in the United States identied aneed for deeper integration of theory into biological research[9]. All immunologists, to some extent, act as theorists in designing and interpreting experiments. However in thiscontext, theory is encoded in a computable form thatfacilitates quantitative validation of the theory against data.In fact, mathematical approaches have a rich history inphysiology (e.g., [ 10]). Computational frameworks are also used quite extensively in engineering for interpreting andpredicting the behavior of complex systems [ 6]. However, there are some nuances associated with mathematical model-ing within the context of the engineering discipline that maybe helpful outside of the discipline. One of the challenges facing the integration of engineering approaches into thedrug development process is that there is little understandingof what engineers actually do [ 11]. T o help bridge that gap, the objective of this paper is to review how two relatedconcepts in engineering, namely prototyping and \"tness for use\" , are applied to improve understanding of immunology in the context of human physiology. 2. What Are Prototyping and \"Fitness for Use\"? Engineers synthesize scientic and mathematical knowledge to solve problems using an iterative process called engineer-ing design. A traditional application of engineering designincludes developing a physical representation of the solutionin the form of a prototype, such as a scale-model of anaircraft for use in a wind tunnel (see Figure 2). However, our knowledge of the system of interest is invariably uncertain.Uncertainties create options in the design process that onemust select among. Prototypes developed at intermediatestages during the design process can represent alternative solutions and thereby provide a mechanism for making informed decisions. Informed decisions during the designprocess guide researchers iteratively towards a global solutionto all of the design objectives. Collectively, the engineeringdesign process is a knowledge generating activity [ 12]. Thus, these prototypes provide an essential role by improvingthe understanding of the problem, by identifying gaps inknowledge (i.e., uncertainties), by soliciting feedback fromend users, and by providing a mechanism to evaluate thetness of the solution against design objectives [ 13]. It is this last role that relates to the term \"tness for use.\" Fitnessfor use is used to characterize how well an object fulllsi t si n t e n d e dp u r p o s e ,n om o r eo rn ol e s s[ 14]. Details that have no influence on tness of the solution can be removedfrom consideration. Conversely, clarity about the intendedpurpose is required prior to creating a prototype. It is thisiterative back and forth between clarifying the purpose andcreating the prototype that enables reaching an optimalsuccinct solution. Prototypes can also include nonphysical objects, such as a mathematical model. A mathematical model is acomplete and consistent set of mathematical equationsthat describe the behavior of the system of interest [ 15]. The equations represent an explicit external description of a mental solution to the problem of synthesizing new knowledge from inspecting data. The process of constructinga mathematical model forces the researcher to wrestlewith these same engineering design concepts (e.g., problemdenition, uncertainties, feedback, and tness). Mathemat-ical models can be particularly valuable in drug discoveryby improving the understanding of the problem and byidentifying uncertainties in domain knowledge relevant tothe target of interest. How uncertainties influence the abilityof a prototype to achieve the design objectives can bequantied using well-dened techniques, such as sensitivityanalysis [ 16] or empirical Bayesian approaches for model- based inference [ 17].Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 3 Figure 2: A common example of a prototype .Ap r o t o t y p eo fa blended wing body aircraft, the X-48B, is shown in a wind tunnel at NASA 's research center in Langley Air Force Base, V A. The windtunnel was used by researchers to evaluate this prototype againststructural, aerodynamic, and operational design objectives for an advanced aircraft concept (NASA photo/Je Caplan). Interdisciplinary work can also be facilitated by using \"boundary\" objects that reside between two di erent cul- tures [ 18], such as engineering and health science. A mathematical model, as a type of boundary object, imposesformalism by requiring an explicit account of the interactingelements and their relationships. In addition, boundaryobjects facilitate common understanding through debate andbuilding consensus with regard to what should be includedor excluded from the model. By explicitly representingknowledge associated with di erent scientic domains, the process of modeling can also help improve problem deni-tion. In essence, the primary goal of making a mathematical model is to make predictions: what do we expect tohappen in a particular interacting system under particularconditions, given our current understanding of interactionsamong components of the system? Similarities between thesimulated behaviors and observed data conrm our explicitstatements while di erences highlight areas of uncertainty in our understanding and provide the engine for scienticprogress [ 19]. By referring to mathematical models as mathematical prototypes, it is the process that one uses togenerate the model (i.e., prototyping) that we are intendingto highlight rather than the product (i.e., a mathematicalmodel). In the following sections, two examples are pre-sented where a mathematical prototype that was created to address questions related to type 1 diabetes and the role of dendritic cells in adaptive immunity. 3. Example 1: Beta Cell Mass and Onset of Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by an impaired ability to produce insulin due to the progressive and selectivedestruction of beta cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhansby the immune system [ 20]. A reduction in endogenous insulin production results in an increase in plasma glucose(hyperglycemia). Chronic hyperglycemia exposes patientswith type 1 diabetes to an increased risk for death if left untreated. Pathogenesis of the disease has been attributedto a variety of environmental and genetic risk factors [ 21]. Y et, two of the most signicant challenges facing the clinicalmanagement of this disease is the increase in incidence oftype 1 diabetes mellitus across the globe [ 22] and the lack of a cure. One of the persistent challenges with understanding the etiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus is the inability toobserve directly the events in the human pancreas that leadto the onset of hyperglycemia. It is clear that a reductionin endogenous insulin production precipitates the onset ofhyperglycemia. It is common wisdom that the onset ofhyperglycemia occurs when 80-95% of an individual's betacells are destroyed [ 23,24] .H o w e v e r ,t h i sw i s d o mi sb a s e d largely on a small number of biopsy studies from individualswith recent disease onset who died soon after diabetes onset(e.g., [ 25-27]). One might infer from this common wisdom that the ability to enhance beta cell function or preservethe remaining beta cells would have a limited therapeuticpotential [ 28]. As a result, the research e ort has focused on developing prognostic tools for identifying individual,who will develop type 1 diabetes, prior to onset. Given theclinical importance of this question, the objective of a recentstudy [ 29] was to develop a mathematical model to test the conceptual model for the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetesmellitus against the histopathological evidence. A meta-analysis was used to extract and assess the signicance of embedded trends within these landmarkstudies. The data reported in these landmark studies provide measurements of the remaining beta cells (i.e., beta cell mass) at the time of death. Patients included in these studies diedbetween 0 and 69 months following diagnosis. While betacell mass or endogenous insulin production is not measureddirectly following onset, C-peptide is used as a surrogatemeasure of endogenous insulin production [ 30-32]. The measurement of C-peptide in a cohort of patients with type1 diabetes has been shown to vary nonlinearly with timefollowing onset. In the years subsequent to onset of type1 diabetes, the beta cell mass slowly declines until there isno endogenous insulin production. Therefore, inferring thebeta cell mass at onset must control for this variability in thetime of beta cell mass measurement. In this new analysis, thelength of time following diagnosis was controlled by limitingthe analysis to a subset of patients who died within threeweeks following diagnosis. As shown in Figure 3, a linear regression of this subset of recent onset patients (dotted line)revealed that the percent reduction in beta cell mass at onsetis not xed but varies with age. This trend is signicant(P< 0.01) and suggests that, in a 20-year old individual, as little as a 40% reduction in beta cell mass is su cient to precipitate clinical symptoms of type 1 diabetes. As this trendis at odds with the existing model for the natural history ofthe disease [ 21], a mathematical model was created to explain this behavior [ 29]. The mathematical model was based on the observation that the growth of the human body is a dynamic nonlinearprocess where di erent parts of the body grow at di erent rates. Of particular relevance to type 1 diabetes mellitus,4 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 0 5 10 15 20020406080100 Age (years)Reduction in beta cell mass (%) Figure 3: Comparison between the predicted and measured excess beta cell mass. Comparison of the excess beta cell mass predicted by the mathematical model (solid curve) compared against thetrendline obtained by linear regression (dotted line) for the measured reduction in beta cell mass in 63 patients that died within three weeks of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Figure wasoriginally published in [ 29]. body weight changes [ 33]a tad i erent rate than beta cell mass [ 27]. One possible explanation for this observed trend in extent of reduction in beta cell mass at onset could beattributed to the dynamic imbalance between the number ofbeta cells and the insulin requirements for a growing body. A mathematical model was used to predict the \"excess\" beta cell mass (EBCM) as a function of age by capturingthe dynamic balance between changes in body weight andbeta cell mass. The \"excess\" beta cell mass corresponds tothe reduction in beta cell mass that is required before hyper-glycemia occurs and is directly related to the measurementsobtained in these landmark studies. This model, shownschematically in Figure 4, is derived from a mass balance on insulin and has a single adjustable parameter. Applyinga mass balance to a system of interest is a common themewoven throughout the chemical engineering curriculum. Inthis instance, the rate of change in insulin is equal to thesource of insulin, which is proportional to beta cell mass,minus the sinks for insulin, which are proportional to bodyweight [ 29]. The resulting model prediction for EBCM as a function of age is shown in Figure 3(solid line). The trendline obtained by linear regression (dotted line) and the observed reduction in beta cell mass in pancreata obtainedfrom the subset of recent onset patients (i.e., died withinthree weeks of diagnosis) are also shown for comparison. TheEBCM relationship exhibits a similar dependence with age, asthe youngest patients exhibited an 85% reduction in beta cellmass while only a 40% reduction was observed by the ageof 20. In other words, the beta cell mass initially grows at afaster rate relative to the whole body. The beta cell mass peaksat 8 years of age and remains constant while the overall bodyweight peaks at 20 years of age. The net result of the di erent growth dynamics is that the \"excess\" beta cell mass declineswith age. In addition, the mathematical model provides aprediction of the beta cell mass required to maintain glucose homeostasis. As a validation of the model, one nds that thedierence between the observed and predicted beta cell mass (i.e., residual beta cell mass) parallels the observed changesin C-peptide following diagnosis (see Figure 5), as described in [34]. In summary, this model (i.e., prototype) suggests that clinical presentation of the disease is not attributed solelyto the destruction of beta cell mass but is the result of adynamic balance between the production of insulin (i.e., betacell mass) and the size of the system (i.e., body weight).The agreement between the model-based predictions and thereported changes in C-peptide suggests two points. First, themethods that were used in these landmark studies exhibita certain degree of accuracy in estimating beta cell mass,while the methods may not have had good precision. Byusing a mathematical model to interpret the trends in thedata, we are able to correct for the imprecision of the assaysused. Second, the similar dynamic trends suggest that thenatural history of the disease is similar across the collectionof clinical studies. While the biological details associated withthe autoimmune attack on the pancreas and regulation ofhuman metabolism are missing in this simplied model,the model exhibits a tness for use in that it is su ciently complex to answer the question posed. Using a mathematicalmodel to represent our prior knowledge of the biology,the model provides a unique perspective to interpret theselandmark studies which challenges the common wisdomin the eld of type 1 diabetes. Improved understandingof the natural history of the disease\u2014as it helps suggest causality\u2014is a necessary prerequisite for improving the clinical management of the disease. Understanding causalityis essential for developing new drugs that hold promise for acure. 4. Example 2: The Role of Dendritic Cells in Adaptive Immunity The human immune system provides the body with natural defenses against the constant onslaught of overt and oppor-tunistic pathogens. This defense against invading pathogensis an emergent behavior of a collection of heterogeneouscell subsets and typies a complex system [ 35]. Individually, each of these subsets have unique roles in orchestratingan immune response. T ogether, these cell subsets inte-grate information across a range of spatial and temporal timescales. Despite the impressive advances in the eld of immunology in the past decades, we know relatively littleabout the interplay between the individual componentsresponsible for immunity [ 1,36]. A mathematical model provides a quantitative framework where fragmented knowl-edge can be synthesized to predict integrated behavior ofthese components. In the remainder of this section, we willdiscuss a prototype that focuses on a cell subset that plays acentral role in orchestrating an immune response\u2014dendriticcells (DC)\u2014in the lung. As the sentinels of the immune system, dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in initiating and maintainingT-cell responses, such as T-helper cell polarization andComputational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine to C Ins Figure 4: A schematic process diagram of the interplay between insulin production and glucose homeostasis. The regulation of substrate metabolism is modeled as an open system, where the concentrations of insulin ( CIns) and glucose ( CGlc) are influenced by flows in (e.g., a glucose input and pancreatic production of insulin ( MIns)) and out (e.g., the disposal of glucose through cellular metabolism or the disposal of insulin through cellular proteolysis) of the system. Material flows are represented by solid lines while the flow of information is representedas a dotted line. For instance, the production of insulin by the pancreas\u2014a material flow\u2014is regulated by concentration of plasma glucose-a flow of information. The molar production of insulin by the pancreas is the product of the beta cell mass times the insulin production per beta cell. Similarly, the rates of disposal of insulin and glucose within the system ( R InsandRGlc) are regulated by the concentration of plasma insulin. The concentration of insulin is a derived intrinsic quantity where the moles of insulin produced by the pancreas are distributed throughout the system volume, which is proportional to body weight. 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 Time following diagnosis (weeks)Fasting C-peptide (nM)020406080 Residual beta cell mass (%) 10010110220 40 60 Figure 5: Dynamic change in residual beta cell mass corresponds to the dynamic change in plasma C-peptide following onset of type 1 diabetes. The residual beta cell mass (x: right axis) andplasma C-peptide (square [ 31], circle [ 32], and + [ 30]: left axis) are shown as a function of time following clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A 9-point moving average of the residual beta cell mass isshown for comparison (dotted line). The residual beta cell mass isthe di erence between the observed beta cell mass and predicted beta cell mass. The dynamic change in observed beta cell mass was obtained from pancreata obtained from patients with type 1diabetes [ 25-27]. The predicted beta cell mass is an estimate of the minimum beta cell mass required to maintain glucose homeostasis. Figure was originally published in [ 34]. crosspresentation of exogenous antigens to cytotoxic T cells [37,38]. The precise role played by DC in de novo activation of T cells is the culmination of a series of steps distributedacross both space and time. These sequential steps includethe recruitment into a peripheral tissue, capture of antigen,tracking to a draining lymph node, and presentation of antigen to T cells [ 37,39]. A generalized schematic of this process is shown in Figure 6. Human biopsy datasuggest that the majority of dendritic cells in the lung epithelium are derived from either blood monocytes (BMs)or blood dendritic cells represent 97% and 3% of the DC precursor populationin the blood. Although these DC precursor cells can beeasily assayed in the blood, their relative contributions tothe dendritic cell population within the lung epithelium andtheir functional roles in driving an immune response areunknown. Moreover, the role of BD has been largely ignoreddue to its relative rarity as a DC precursor. T o explore the implications of DC precursor recruitment into the lung, we created a mathematical model that capturesthe dynamics and origin of tissue dendritic cells [ 41,42]. The dynamic model suggests that BDs are selectively enriched within the lung as they comprise 20% of the DC population in the lung [ 41]. While it is intriguing that BD may exhibit ah i g h e ra nity for the recruitment stimuli compared to BM, a more important question is whether this observationis functionally signicant. The structure of the model wasdesigned to capture an important aspects of dendritic cellbiology\u2014an age-structure. As a dendritic cell traverses from blood to lung to lymph node, it turns on di erent \"subroutines\" encoded within its genes enabling it to perform di erent functions within each compartment. The dynamic execution of these subroutinesis represented by dynamic changes in proteins expressedon the surface of a DC. The sequence of cellular changesare collectively referred to as DC maturation. Proteinsexpressed on the cell surface enable a cell to sense andrespond to its environment. These dynamic changes in DCproteins indicate that the particular cellular response of aDC to the environmental context is highly dependent onthe DC's particular maturational age. In addition, the abilityof a DC to capture and process protein antigens derivedfrom invading pathogens is also highly dependent on thematurational state of a DC. Given the dynamic nature ofthe DC population, the appropriate computational paradigm6 Computational and Mathematical Methods in for challenge Epithelial microenvironmentLung airway Lung epithelium \u00a8ve CD4+ T cells(AG(t)) Figure 6: Schematic diagram of mathematical model for dendritic cell tra cking within the lung epithelial microenvironment.

While physiologically-structured models have been pro- posed since the mid-1960s [ 43], they are seldom used to describe cell populations due to the di culty in obtain- ing appropriate experimental data and the mathematicalcomplexity of the resulting models. Given appropriate data,the additional complexity enables asking di erent questions. The dynamic response of cell populations in the blood toperturbations has been represented using physiologically-structured models (e.g., [ 44,45]). In this case, age-associated dierences in antigen processing ability of these two DC precursor populations can be compared by explicitly trackingthe functionally unique subpopulations. Di erences between BM- and BD-derived DC become especially apparent whenantigen proteins also change with time. When antigenproteins have a half-life in the tissue of 60 minutes, BD-derived DC presents 250% more antigen peptide per cell relative to the DC derived from BM. De novo activation of T-helper cells requires that signals, including the density ofantigen peptides, exceed activation thresholds [ 46,47]. If the density of antigen peptides is averaged across all DC subsets,the dynamic change in density of peptides may be belowthe threshold required for activation of T-helper cells. Byexplicitly accounting for variability in DC phenotypes, thedensity of peptides presented by this minority DC subsetmay exceed the threshold for activation. While these studieshighlight the importance of measuring DC heterogeneity,they also highlight how computer models can be used tointegrate heterogeneous data into a quantitative picture ofthe dynamic role of dendritic cells in coordinating immunity.5. Reflecting Back: Goldilocks and the T wo Maxims The use of models to aid in understanding system behavior is a central theme in science that transcends disciplinary boundaries [ 48]. In the previous sections, two examples served to illustrate some of the nuances associated withmathematical modeling from an engineering perspective,namely, the concepts of prototyping and tness for use. In the case of the type 1 diabetes model, the two competing theories are that the degree of beta cell reductionat onset is a xed value or that the observed reduction is aresult of a dynamic balance between beta cell mass and bodyweight. From a mathematical perspective, the models exhibitsimilar complexity as both models use a single adjustableparameter to predict the observed behavior. The AkaikeInformation Criterion [ 49-51], based upon information the- ory, is used to distinguish between these competing modelsusing the available data. Intensive computing techniques, likenonparametric bootstrap resampling [ 52,53] and empirical Bayesian methods [ 17], complement information-theoretic metrics by assessing the uncertainty of those metrics, giventhe inherent uncertainty in measuring biological systems.Moreover, this simplied model was also able to comparechanges in beta cell mass to changes in C-peptide followingdiagnosis [ 34]. Finally, one could construct a model that includes more detail regarding the di erent timescales for insulin production [ 54-56], insulin signaling [ 57], and beta cell autoimmunity [ 58]. However, the simplied model exhibits a tness for use as inclusion of such detail isunnecessary to test the prevailing theory.Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 7 In the case of the dendritic cell tra cking study, a new model is proposed to represent cellular heterogeneityand to provide an estimate of its potential importance. Incontrast, existing models that assume that all dendritic cellsare homogeneous (e.g., [ 59]) are unable to capture with the observed dynamic patterns of cell surface marker expres- sion during dendritic cell maturation [ 60-62]. Additional structure is required to represent this cellular heterogeneitywithin the model. Using computational techniques, such asparameter identication [ 63,64], the increased cost, in terms of parameters, associated with a more complex model thatcaptures a larger set of data is justied. Y et, the age-structuredmodeling framework is not well suited to explore questionsrelated to the spatial organization of the lymph node or thediscrete nature of cell-to-cell interactions. The form of theage-structured model, which is a set of coupled ordinarydierential equations, assumes that the age compartments are well mixed, that is the cells are homogeneous within anage compartment. Agent-based models of the lymph nodeare better suited to such questions [ 65-68]. Historically, agent-based models focus on cell population-level behaviorand neglect the molecular details associated with cellulardecision making, such as an evolution in cell phenotype dueto local changes in developmental cues. Although, modelsthat aim to combine cellular-level with population-levelbehavior are emerging [ 69]. This highlights the iterative nature of the engineering design process. As additionaldata become available, the mathematical prototype can berevised to reflect this new information. Moreover, the formof the model may change depending on the tness for use of the particular mathematical framework (e.g., ordinary dierential equation-based or agent-based model) to address the questions of interest. Reminiscent of the notable children's story \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears,\" a common criticism of a particularmathematical model is that it is either too complicated ortoo simplistic. In many cases, these statements are subjectiveas they are based upon the collective experience of thecritic [ 19]. One of the benets of representing theory in a computable form is that computational tools can beused to assess objectively the complexity of the model.Implied in the criticism is the question of model parsimony.Conventionally, there are two maxims that bracket therange of plausible explanations for observed phenomena:Ockham's Razor and Einstein's Safety Shield. The conceptof Ockham's Razor is that if there are a series of theoriesand the available data cannot distinguish between thedierent theories, then the simplest theory should receive priority. The concept of Einstein's Safety Shield is that oneshould construct the simplest theory to explain observedphenomena but no simpler. The emergence of information-theoretic approaches provides a quantitative basis for thesemaxims (see [ 70] for an introduction to the topic). While these are important topics to consider when modeling immunology [ 71], information-theoretic concepts have been infrequently applied to modeling e orts in the eld [ 72]. Recent developments in rule-based modeling [ 73-75], time scale analysis [ 76], and in silico model-based inference [ 17] all help reduce the barrier for integrating theory\u2014in theform of mathematical models and engineering concepts\u2014 with experimental immunology. Within the domain ofcellular decision making, the combination of these threemodeling developments allow one to specify a mathematicalmodel with limited a priori bias in the model structureand use the available data to determine objectively the appropriate level of complexity, as illustrated in this sequence of papers [ 76-78]. In summary, engineering is historically a eld in which basic research is translated into commercially viable productsand processes. The commercial synthesis of basic science datais achieved using computational frameworks. Translatingdata into knowledge is a major challenge facing contempo-rary health science research. Two examples discussed in theprevious paragraphs aim to illustrate how the computationaltoolkit of an engineer can be integrated into experimentalimmunology via mathematical prototyping. These exam-ples also serve to illustrate that embracing a quantitativeperspective provides an opportunity to integrate focusedexperimentation into a larger mosaic that describes humanimmunity. Through mathematical prototyping we are able torepresent explicitly our prior knowledge of the dynamics ofimmunity and test this prior knowledge against experimentaldata. Moreover, the process of creating a mathematical modelprovides a roadmap for future experimental e ort by iden- tifying important knowledge gaps in the collective scienticunderstanding. Ultimately, improved understanding of thecomplexity of biological systems is essential for promotinghuman health and restoring health through the rationaldesign of new therapeutics.

T omodel the migration of OT1 CTLs and antibodies from the injection to the skin compartment, we use delay di erential equations (DDEs). The outcomes of the mathematical model are in good agreement with the in vivo results. Moreover, sensitivity analysis of the mathematical model underlines the key role of OT1 CTLs and suggests that a possible reduction of the number of injectedantibodies should not a ect substantially the treatment e cacy. 1. Introduction Melanoma is a malignant tumor caused by the mutation of melanocytes, that is, the cells that produce the melanin andare responsible of the color of the skin. Despite intensiveresearch, melanoma still represents one of the most aggres-sive malignant cancers [ 1]. Many experimental approaches are now focused on targeting cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs) against cancer. A common strategy to enable CTLecacy against tumor is to activate na \u00a8ve CTLs in vitro through the use of cells engineered to present the tumor antigen, and to reinject them in the host. However, even if activated CTLs are able to inltrate into tumor masses, inmost cases they remain unable to contrast cancer growth [ 2]. As experimental evidence suggests, tumor-inltrating lym-phocytes are rendered ine ective by coinhibitory molecules expressed by tumor and stroma cells surfaces [ 3]. In order to gain complete rejection of tumors, injection and stimulation of CTLs is not su cient and should be, therefore, coupled with complementary measures votedat boosting CTLs migration inside tumor masses, andconjugation and killing of target cells [ 4-6]. One way of boosting CTLs actions is represented by stimulation throughthe binding of costimulatory proteins expressed on CTLssurface. Among possible surface proteins, Anti-CD137, also known as 4-1BB, represents a valuable target. This protein is expressed by multiple IS cells such as activated T, NK, B- lymphocytes, dendritic cells and also by tumor endotheliumcells [ 7]. Its natural ligand (CD137L) can be found on activated antigen-presenting cells surface [ 8]. The combined administration of monoclonal antibodies specically targeted to bind Anti-CD137 proteins and in vitro activated-OT1 CTLs was demonstrated to be able toprevent the melanoma formation in B16-OV A mouse models [7]. Moreover, the combined treatment avoided appearing of undesired side e ects like the hepatotoxicity, observed only under anti-CD137 only high-dosage treatment [ 9]. The IS stimulation mechanisms of Anti-CD137 immunostimula-tory monoclonal antibodies are multilayered and include theimproving rates, and chemotaxis sensitivity of activated-OT1 CTLs [ 6,10-12]. T o reproduce the dynamics of this biological process, ad e l a yd i erential-equation-(DDE-) based model has been developed. The model reproduces two di erent compart- ments: the injection point compartment, where both anti-bodies and OT1 cells are injected and the skin compartmentwhere melanoma develops.2 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine 2. Biological Background The in vivo experiment is carried on B16-OV A mice, mice transduced with the chicken ovalbumin gene. The ovalbu-min is used as a model tumor antigen. B16 melanoma cellline was derived from an aggressive spontaneous melanomain pure C57BL6, and B16F10 was derived as a clonal variantfrom a lung metastasis of this cell line. In tumor immunol-ogy, these variants of melanoma are considered poorlyimmunogenic in the sense that immune-mediated rejectionsor growth retardations are di cult to achieve. The experimental setup is oriented to model thera- peutic synergy between anti-CD137 monoclonal antibodiesand adoptive melanoma. is apoorly immunogenic murine tumor. The a single injection In vivo experiments have been executed by Professor Melero and coworkers at the University of Navarra [ 13]. Mice are divided in ve di erent groups; all groups are composed by ve individuals. Each group is treated with a di erent treatment: Untreated (control) mice, mice treated with na \u00a8ve OT1 CTLs, mice Anti- CD137 monoclonal antibodies, and mice treated with in vitro activated OT1 CTLs, mice treated with Anti-CD137 monoclonal antibodies, mice treated in vitro activatedOT1 CTLs and Anti-CD137 monoclonal antibodies. Theexperiment runs for 30 days. At day 0, all B16-OV A micereceive one injection of melanoma malignant cells. Thetherapeutic treatment used during in vivo experiments iscomposed by one single boost, and it is administered atday 3. Melanoma surface measurements (mm 2) are taken at given times for each treatment and are used to estimate theecacy of each vaccination strategy. We note here that in order to compare in vivo and in silico results we computedthe estimated mean surfaces entitled with the use of eachtreatment. Among the tested treatments, only the combinedadministration of activated OT1 CTLs and antibodies wasable to show complete depletion of the tumor burden,whereas the other treatments remained almost ine ective [13]. 3. The Model We realized a model with two compartments in order to reproduce the dynamics of the process. The rst compart- ment is represented by the injection point compartment where the treatment is administered, whereas the second oneis represented by the skin compartment where melanomatumor cells proliferate and where the cancer-IS competitionoccurs. T o this end, a system of seven delay di erential equations has been set up. The model takes into accountthe following entities: injected activated OT1 CTLs ( E)a n d injected ( the injection point compart- ment; melanoma C), tumor antigens ( A), activated OT1 CTLs and antibodies that have reached the skin ( E sand As) and na \u00a8ve CTLs ( N) for the skin compartment. It has also been assumed that Injected OT1 CTLs, and antibodiesmove from the injection point to the skin compartmentTable 1: Model variables. Each variable describes the total number of the related entity in the associated compartment. Variable Description compartment E Injected activated OT1 CTLs injection point Ab Injected anti-CD137 antibodies injection point C Melanoma tumor cells skin A Tumor antigens skin Es Activated OT1 CTLs skin As Injected anti-CD137 antibodies skin N Na\u00a8ve CTLs skin only. Figure 1 shows the conceptual model for the biological problem; model entities are listed in Table 1 .

Antibodies in the skin compartment (As) have multiple positive e ects on activated OT1 CTLs dynamics ( Es). One of these e ects is represented by the ability of promoting Esduplication. This is modeled through the Holling type II function 7[As/(As+k1)]Es,w h e r e7is the maximum biological duplication rate of Esandk1is a tuned threshold. When the number of Asis high enough, the term [As/(As+k1)] tends towards 1, thus entitling maximum duplication rates for Es.T h et e r m 11E(t)i su s e dt om o d e l migration of OT1 CTLs from the injection compartment tothe skin compartment.

The model is composed by two compartments: the rst compartment (bottom) where the treatment is administered, and the skin compartment (top) where the immune-system-melanoma competition occurs. Arrows are used to indicate the interaction between entities (i.e., the interaction between the antibodies and activated CTLs in the skin compartment), the change of a particular condition of an entity (i.e., the activation of na \u00a8ve CTLs or the migration of antibodies from a compartment to another), the introduction and disappearing of entities (i.e., the production of newborn na \u00a8ve CTLs by thymus or the disappearing of antigens that are presented to na \u00a8ve CTLs). White boxes are used to better explain the meaning of the arrows. Both antibodies ( Ab)a n d activated OT1 CTLs ( E) migrate to the skin compartment. In the skin compartment, antibodies ( As) stimulate duplication and inltration into tumor mass of activated OT1 CTLs ( Es), which kill melanoma cells ( C). Killed melanoma cells release antigens ( A) that are captured by antigen presenting cells and presented to antigen-specic na \u00a8ve OT1 CTLs ( N). Na are then stimulated to become active CTLs (Es). the rst compartment ( E) to the second one ( Es) entitles a time delay of a n do c c u r sw i t hag i v e nr a t e 11. The term 6NA models the activation of na \u00a8ve CTLs Nthanks to the presence of antigens ( A) released by killed cancer cells. The biological process that explains the presenceof this term is summarized as follows. Antigenic sequences released by killed melanoma cells may be captured by antigen presenting cells (APC) such as macrophages and dendriticcells. These cells process the antigens and present themon their cellular surface to na \u00a8ve CTLs ( N). After thispresentation process, na \u00a8ve CTLs cells may be activated, and if some complementary biological steps are accomplished(i.e., stimulation by cytokines released by T helper cells),they can become able to kill tumor cells. This process is notmodeled in depth since it involves the modeling of otherentities that are not considered fundamental for the problem. The number of newly activated OT1 CTLs is instead directly estimated on the basis of the quantity of released antigens.The last term ( 8Es) is used to take into account natural death of OT1 CTLs.4 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine (4) Melanoma cells: dC dt=(12ln(C))\u00b7C3/bracketleftbiggAs+k2 As+k3/bracketrightbigg EsC. (4) Equation ( 4) describes the melanoma cells ( C)b e h a v i o r in the skin compartment. The rst term ((a 1a2ln(C))\u00b7C) represents a Gompertzian growth [ 14], whereas the second term denotes killing of Cby activated OT1 CTLs that are already in the skin compartment ( Es). One of the most important actions accomplished by antibodies ( As)i st o boost chemotaxis sensitivity of CTLs ( Es) thus enabling better inltration into the tumor mass. This translates into higher killing rates of melanoma cancer cells by activatedCTLs (E s). This is modeled through the term 3[(As+ k2)/(As+k3)]EsC,w h e r e3is the maximum killing rate of CbyEs,a n dk2andk3(k2/lessmuchk3) are tuned constants. When the number of Asis high enough, the term [( As+k2)/(As+k3)] tends towards 1, thus entitling maximum killing rates for E s. In absence of antibodies, having k2/lessmuchk3, the term translates into3k2/k3< 3, which involves lower killing rates.

They can also be captured by APC, which will present the antigen to na \u00a8ve CTLs. As already stated in ( 3), capturing of the antigen by APC is not modeled and the number of captured antigens isestimated on the basis of na \u00a8ve CTLs ( N) that are \u00a8ve CTLs: dN dt=h(MN)6NA. models the behavior of na \u00a8ve OT1 CTLs (N).

Mis the number of circulating na \u00a8ve CTLs under safe conditions given by the leukocyte formula.If switching of na \u00a8ve CTLs to activated CTLs occurs, the number of na \u00a8ve CTLs gets lower. As a consequence of that, the na \u00a8ve population is repopulated with newborn cells and tends towards Mat a rate h. The second term ( 6NA) models the CTLs state changing from na \u00a8ve to activated ( Es), thanks to presentation of the antigen by APC. (7) Antibodies (skin compartment): dAs dt=11Ab(t)9AsEs10As. (7)Antibodies that have reached the skin compartment ( As) are modeled and described by ( 7). Antibodies in the skin compartment are supposed to be proportional to the numberof antibodies in the injection point compartment ( Ab)w i t ha proportionality constant 11and a time delay of . They also disappear by stimulating OT1 cells activities and are subject to a natural degradation ( 9AsEsand10As). According to the considered cell populations and inter- actions, the mathematical model can be then representedby the following system of seven nonlinear delay di 5A6NA.(8) Since we consider mainly populations that appear in the system as a consequence of treatment administrations(except for melanoma and na \u00a8ve CTLs), the following Cauchy initial conditions have been set for the equations: E(0) =0,Ab(0)=0,Es(0)=0,As(0)=0,A(0)=0, N(0)=M,C(0)=C0. (9) The physical time-step (t) has been chosen equal to 8 hours, and the integration time has been then computed upto 10 2\u00b7(t)33 days. The reason of this choice is biological, and it is given by the fact that in the in vivo experimentit is not possible to observe relevant biological phenomenain smaller time intervals. In particular, the minimum timerequired for cell division, which represents one of the most important biological phenomena, is usually not lower than 6-8 hours [ 15]. This may be not true in other in vivo setups, such as in case of allergies, where the time scale varies fromseconds to minutes. Some parameters appearing in the equations have been estimated from the literature (see Table 2 ), and from meas- urements made during the in vivo experiment. In particular, melanoma growth rates have been esti- mated from diameter measurements made at di erent times in melanomas in ve untreated mice. Melanomas have twogrowth phases, radial and vertical [ 16]. The rst phase is represented by a radial growth, in which malignant cellsgrow in a radial fashion in the epidermis.

In this case, we supposed that only theradial growth phase is involved. By supposing a disk-shapedlayout for the melanoma and having knowledge of the meandiameter of melanoma cancer cells, the number of cancercells (in the observed melanomas) has been estimated forall the measurements made. This data has been used with acurve tting procedure to estimate the unknown parametersneeded to model the cancer growth kinetics under thehypothesis of a Gompertzian growth for the tumor, usedsuccessfully in our previous experience [ 13,17,18]. The Gompertz law, which is commonly considered suitable fordescribing populations growths, uses two factors: a constantgrowth term and a shrink term that increases in time and isrelated to antiangiogenic factors, giving as a result a sigmoidshape to the curve. The initial number of injected cancercellsC 0, the number of injected OT1 CTLs and antibodies na \u00a8ve OT1 CTLs under safe conditions ( M) have been chosen into reasonable ranges given by in vivo measurements. Remaining parameters have been chosen in plausible biological ranges in such a way to reproduce the set ofexperimental data for the activated OT1 CTLs + Anti-CD37Ab combined treatment, and counterchecked against the other vaccine scenarios taken into account ( Table 2 ). 4. Results T o reproduce the dynamics of the model, we took into account four treatments that have been tested in vivo:untreated (control), in vitro activated OT1 CTLs, Anti- CD137 CTLs + Anti-CD137 monoclonal antibodies. Among such treatments, only the last one (treated with activated CTLs + Anti-CD137 monoclonal antibodies)showed complete eradication of the tumor burden, whereasthe other treatments remained almost ine ective. Entities behaviors for all the analyzed treatments are shown in Figure 2 . In absence of therapy (blue dashed line), there is no induced immune response and thus the numberof melanoma cells grows without any intervention from IScells, whose plots remain flat. The same scenario arises when the Anti-CD137 mon- oclonal antibodies treatment is administered (see Figure 2 , green dotted lines). The mechanism that triggers the ISresponse is driven by the presence of activated OT1 CTLsthat can kill melanoma cells, which release antigens able tofurther stimulate the IS response. This fact can be partially seen if the treatment based upon the administration of in vitro activated OT1 CTLs is used (Figure 2 , red dot-dashed lines). The E splots show some evidence of activated OT1 CTLs in the skin. These cells areable to kill melanoma cells ( C), which release antigens ( A) that are captured by APCs and then used to promote the dierentiation of newborn na \u00a8ve CTLs ( N)t oa c t i v a t e dO T 1 CTLs (E s). However, in absence of Anti-CD137 antibodies, which promote both duplication and inltration into tumormasses of activated OT1 CTLs, recruitment of newborn na \u00a8ve CTLs is too bland and tardy to stimulate an IS response ableto stop the melanoma.6 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine Melanoma Cells ( C)T otal entities Time (days)0 5 10 15 20 25 301103106 (a)01234 0 5 10 15 20 25 30T otal entitiesAntigens ( A) Time (days) (b) 02468\u00d7106 0 5 10 15 20 25 30T otal entities Time (days)OT1 T-cells in the skin ( Es) (c)Naive T-cells ( N) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30T otal entities Time (days)00.511.52\u00d7105 (d) 0246810 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Time (days)Antibodies in the skin ( As) \u00d7104T otal entities (e)0246810 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Time (days)T otal entities\u00d7105 Antibodies in the injection point ( Ab) Activated OT1 T-cells Activated CD137 T-cells in the injection point ( E) 02468 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Time (days)T otal entities\u00d7105 Untreated (g) Figure 2: System behavior obtained with the use of di erent vaccination protocols: untreated (blue dashed line), activated OT1 CTLs (red dot-dashed lines), Anti-CD137 monoclonal antibodies and activated OT1 CTLs + Anti-CD137 monoclonal antibodies (black solid lines).

In this case, both Anti-CD137 antibodies ( Ab)a n da c t i v a t e dO T 1 CTLs (E) are injected at day three and then migrate to the skin compartment. Activated OT1 CTLs ( E s)a r es t i m u l a t e d to duplicate and to inltrate into tumor masses thanks to the presence of antibodies in the skin compartment ( As). As a consequence of this, many more melanoma cells ( C)a r e killed, and copious number of antigens ( A) is released, thus promoting the activation of na \u00a8ve CTLs ( N)t oa c t i v a t e dO T 1 CTLs (Es), which further act against melanoma. T o qualitatively compare the model results with the in vivo data, we estimated (using the number of cancer cells) themelanoma surface given by the mathematical model underthe same assumptions made for estimating the Gompertzgrowth parameters. We then compared the time evolutionof the melanoma surface given by the mathematical modelwith the mean surface observed in the in vivo experimentfor the following cases: the untreated (control) case andthe activated CTLs + Anti-CD137 monoclonal antibodiescombined treatment case. The other cases are not presentedsince they give back the same scenario observed in theuntreated case for both the experiments. Comparison for the untreated case is shown in Figure 3(a) . As expected, since we only observe the mela- noma growth, the mathematical model perfectly reproducesthe in vivo setup. Comparison for the combined treatmentcase is shown in Figure 3(b) . The mean in vivo melanoma behavior is well reproduced by the mathematical model that is able to quantitatively and qualitatively represent the shape of the curve observed in the in vivo experiments.In Figures 3(c) and 3(d) , we show absolute and relative dierences between in silico and in vivo measurements for the untreated and activated OT1 CTLs + Anti-CD137combined treatments, respectively. Relative di using the following metric: d(x,y) =|xy|/ (1/2(|x|+|y|)). It must be noted here that the initial gap between the mathematical model and the in vivo experiment measure-ments visible in Figures 3(b) and 3(d) is mainly due to the di erent nature of measurements. In the simulations, the total number of cells is always known and it is used toestimate the melanoma surface. In the in vivo experiment,melanoma surface is instead measured on mice skin. Evenif the injection of tumor cells is done at time 0, melanomaneeds some time to arise and become visible even if themelanoma cells are all already present in mice. 5. Sensitivity Analysis T o understand how the system varies under di erent param- eter values, it is important to analyze the sensitivity ofthe model to variation of parameters. Classical sensitivityanalysis is done usually by varying a given parameter inreasonable ranges and keeping the other ones xed. Theresults obtained are obviously dependent on the values ofthe xed parameters, and di erent sets of values may entitle completely di erent results.In order to overcome the limits of classical sensitivity analysis, many techniques have been developed. One ofthese is represented by Partial rank correlated coe cients (PRCC) [ 23], a statistical sensitivity analysis technique, which computes a partial correlation on rank-transformeddata between input and output values, represented in this case by the model parameters (input) and the model entities behaviors (output). It important to note here that the obtained correlation indexes do not depend on a given set of parameters, andit is therefore possible to estimate how the variations of aparameter may influence the results of the model, no matterwhat the value of the other parameters is. PRCC returnedvalues varying in [ 1, 1] and estimated the correlation between input and output parameters. A value near 1suggests a high (linear) positive correlation, whereas a valuenear 1 indicates a negative correlation. Values around 0 usually indicate little or no correlation. Using this methodology in conjunction with the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), which is used to sample theparameters' space, we analyze the e ects of the input parameters most influencing the growth of cancer cells(C). We plot PRCCs versus the experiment time for the most important parameters to see how the sensitivity ofparameters changes as the system dynamics progresses. 5.1. Impact Variation of the Treatment Quantities pandq on the Number of Melanoma Cells. The two parameters p andqrefer to the number of activated OT1 e ector cells (E) and Anti-CD137 antibodies ( Ab) injected as a single boost treatment against the melanoma, according to the invivo experiment. In Figure 4 , we show the PRCC time plots for the two parameters. As expected, just after the injectionof the treatment, both the two parameters show a negativecorrelation with the number of cancer cells. It is worth tonote that pshows good correlation in particular in the rst ten days, whereas a weaker and almost constant correlation isrelated to q. This may suggest that the e ects of the treatment are mainly driven by the OT1 e ector cells and, even if antibodies are needed to obtain protection (as discussedearlier and shown in Figure 2 ), a reduction in their quantity may entitle similar treatment e ectiveness. 5.2. Impact of Na \u00a8ve OT1 CTLs Initial Number ( M)a n d Recovery Rate ( h) on the Number of Cancer Cells. TheM parameter indicates the initial number of antigen-specicna\u00a8ve CTLs in the host, and the hparameter represents the rate of newborn na \u00a8ve CTLs generated by thymus selection. TheMparameter negatively correlates over time with the number of melanoma cells ( Figure 5(a) ), thus conrming that the action of na \u00a8ve OT1 T cells induced by the treatment administration is fundamental for treatment e ectiveness. Surprisingly it seems that the variation of the rate ofintroduced newborn na \u00a8ve CTLs does not influence the number of melanoma cells, since no correlation is shownover time (see Figure 5(b) ). 5.3.

(Es) represent the number of entities that are directly able to kill melanoma tumor cells. It is, therefore, trivial to see that 3and8, which represent the rate of killed melanoma cells by activated OT1 e ector cells and the half-life of OT1 e ec- tor cells, have a strong negative and positive correlation withthe number of cancer cells, respectively, (see Figures 6(a) and 6(b) ). A negative correlation is also present for 7, which represents the maximal duplication rate of ( Es) (see Figure 6(c) ). However, in this case the correlation remains weaker, thus suggesting how small variations on the cellsduplication rates, which can be associated with individualdiversity, do not influence considerably the total behavior of cancer cells. 5.4. Impact of Antibody-Related Parameters on the Number of Cancer Cells. The 4parameter is used to represent the rate of antigens released by killed C, whereas the 5 represents the specic antigen half-life. If the former has a strong negative PRCC correlation with the number ofC(Figure 7(a) ), particularly in the rst period just after treatment administration, the latter interestingly seems to benot correlated with the number of C(Figure 7(b) ).Computational and Mathematical Methods in PRCC Time (days) Dummy pSignicant ( P<0.01)1 0.80.60.4 0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10 5 10 15 20 25 30 (a)CPRCC time-plot for p PRCC Time (days) Dummy qSignicant ( P<0.01)1 0.80.60.40.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 (b)CPRCC time-plot for q Figure 4:p(a) andq(b) PRCC plots computed on C.

Impact of the Tumor Growth and Shrink Parameters ( 1 and2) on the Number of Cancer Cells. The1and2param- eters represent the Gompertz growth parameters used tomodel the growth of melanoma. The range of variation forthese two parameters has been set equal to the condencerange given by the curve tting procedure used to estimate the parameters' values from in vivo measurements. In this way, we reasonably take into account the possible melanomagrowths that may also be observed in the in vivo experiments.PRCC plots over time are represented in Figures 8(a) and 8(b) . Even if positive and negative PRCC correlations are somewhat expected, there is a small time window just afterthe treatment injection time where no correlation occurs.This may be explained by the fact that variations of themelanoma growth rate do not influence substantially (at leastinitially) the e ectiveness of the treatment. 6. Conclusions We presented a mathematical model, which reproduces the immune response against B16-melanoma induced by thecombined administration of activated OT1 CTLs and Anti-CD 137 immunostimulatory monoclonal antibodies. Them o d e lu s e sd e l a yd i erential equations to reproduce the presence of two di erent compartments: the injection point compartment where the treatment is administered, and the skin compartment, where the melanoma-Immune system competition occurs. The model proved to be able to coherently reproduce the in vivo experiment results obtained with four vaccinationstrategies (untreated, only activated OT1 CTLs, only mon-oclonalAb, OT1 CTLs + monoclonal Ab). Moreover, the m o d e li sa b l et oq u a l i t a t i v e l ya n dq u a n t i t a t i v e l yr e p r o d u c ethe time dynamics of melanoma under the administrationof the combined treatment. Results show that activated CTLs+ Anti-CD137 monoclonal combined treatment acts in twoways: directly by activated OT1 CTLs that are able to killmelanoma and antibodies that boost CTLs activities andindirectly by promoting activation of na \u00a8ve OT1 CTLs thanks to the releasing of melanoma cells antigens. Among some useful ndings, sensitivity analysis under- lined the important role of activated OT1 cytotoxic treat-ment, suggesting that it would be in principle possible toobtain similar e ectiveness lowering the number of admin- istered antibodies, which, however, remain fundamental togain e ectiveness. Such kind of suggestions may be useful for optimizing treatment e ectiveness and minimizing the risk of side e ects. Future work will be focused on studying analytically a simplied model without delay and in comparing the obtained results with Sim-B16, an agent-based model devel- oped to reproduce the same in vivo experiment [ 13].
