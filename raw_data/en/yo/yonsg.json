Elsewhere, it is already operating in Canada and South East Asian markets, including Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia. The firm began trading in the Philippines in June this year. Speaking to NutraIngredients-Asia, marketing manager at the Branding and Public Relations, Agnes Wong, said that herbal supplements and skincare products would be the main product focus in the country. The other portfolios will include personal care and household products such as detergent and pillows. \"We hope to focus on the health foods, supplements and skincare products, because these two core products can really help people for overall general wellness,\" Wong said.
