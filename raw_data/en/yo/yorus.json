As we navigate world events, the pandemic, climate change, and our own individual traumas, our goal is to not only survive, but thrive and live powerful lives we can be proud of. Ayni is the Quechua word for sacred reciprocity, and the way in which we humans can be in right relationship with the world around us. These are the times indigenous prophecies have spoken about. Join us for two days of ceremony with the Earth wisdom teachings from Mesoamerica and Peru as we reconnect, heal, and nourish our hearts. We will work with our ancestors to build our spiritual support team and partake in a plant medicine ceremony with Cacao. We will learn how to make specific offerings to the land that help you create magic in your life. Being at Esalen provides a special opportunity to be in connection with the elemental spirits of the native coastline and the sacredness of the land where the sweet and thermal waters meet the ocean. During our time together... Our weekend will feature two guest faculty, who will bring their magic to enhance our understandings over the course of the week... Kyle McBride is an international chef, food justice advocate, ferment and wild food enthusiast. He draws inspiration from the abundance and diversity of nature and seeks to honor our sacred connection to the earth through his food. Marisa Anita Reyes is a community leader and medicine woman who uses her voice, the charango, harmonium, frame drum, and crystal bowl to take people on a journey to open their hearts, meet their ancestors, and connect to Spirit. Come and share a weekend of Earth-based practices in community with love, support, and guidance as you learn about the Quechua and Mazotec traditions that have honored living in right relation with the Earth for thousands of years. Xochitl (So-chil) Ashe is a trained herbalist with deep indigenous roots. Initiated at the age of sixteen in her Peruvian healing traditions, she has been a conduit for sacred medicines and herbs for twenty years. She works with transformational cacao and mushroom ceremonies in Mexico, especially attending to generational trauma.
