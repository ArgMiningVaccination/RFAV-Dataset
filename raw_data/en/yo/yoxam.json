It's not easy being an ecologically conscious farmer these days. But a relatively new product appears to be making inroads in the agricultural industry. Last summer Eden Bioscience of Bothell, Washington, released Messenger, a non-toxic pesticide, which like a vaccine in humans, tricks plants into defending themselves against intruders. Messenger uses the very agents that cause disease to protect against disease. It isn't a synthetic chemical or a genetic modification; it's based on harpin \u2014- the protein by-product of a bacterial pathogen. Applying harpin technology to a plant's surface activates its immune system. The plant erects defenses because it thinks it is under attack, even though it isn't. Because the harpin protein is naturally occurring, and because organisms already have experience with this protein, Messenger is virtually non-toxic. The plant never absorbs the protein; instead it sits on the surface, eliciting a hypersensitive response in the plant and triggering its defense mechanisms. So far Eden claims it has not found anything that Messenger actually hurts. It doesn't destroy the pests and disease; it simply boosts the immune system. Messenger degrades in sunlight and rain and can be applied as seldom as one or two times a year. Eden claims that Messenger helps produce bigger, better fruits, and that crops tend to mature earlier. In tests performed by the Agriculture Development Group, an independent agricultural research and information service, Messenger-treated artichokes were triple the size of untreated ones, and the biomass of zucchini, cantaloupe and watermelon plants was more than double. Though Messenger appears, so far, to be safe for the environment and for human consumption, it still may not replace traditional pesticides. It works as a supplement to existing toxic pesticides, not as a substitution. In addition, it doesn't work on all crops. Messenger has performed well on cucurbits, potatoes, strawberries and tobacco, but not as well on cherries, apples and grapes. Preliminary data from one trial on cherries indicates decreased incidence of post-harvest disease and increased sugar content, but other tests indicate Messenger isn't effective against cherry mildew. Research done on fire blight -\u2014 a highly destructive bacterial disease \u2014- on apples at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station at Geneva was even more tenuous. While in the past Messenger was effective in controlling the infection of fire blight on apple blossoms and shoots, this year it wasn't. \"We still think Messenger will be good at controlling fire blight, but we have to understand why we didn't get such good results in our tests this year,\" said Geneva plant pathologist Herb Adwinckle. According to Adwinckle, who is also researching the use of Messenger in genetic engineering, the poor performance could be a based on how the product was produced this year, or on an effect of the weather. Another year of research will be required to understand why Messenger didn't work this season. \"We think all the research that went into finding this chemical, and then its use as a spray, and then its use as a gene in plants is really very exciting,\" Adwinckle said. \"So we're hoping we can get to the bottom of why it didn't perform as well, and we can use it because we like the idea of this technology.\" The consumer market may be opening up. Eden recently signed a deal with the MiracleGro manufacturer, The Scotts Company. Messenger will also be available to small-scale farmers in Ethiopia and Kenya later this year. Eden CEO Jerry Butler sees Africa and the Mediterranean countries as emerging markets. [Discuss this story on Plastic.com](http://www.plastic.com/article.pl?sid=01/09/04/1658223) [Hidden "}
