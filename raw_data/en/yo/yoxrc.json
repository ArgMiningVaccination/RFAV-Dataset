Winter brings a continuous onslaught of foreign invaders for our immune system to fight off, but certain supplements can do a lot to keep you feeling well. It's true that our immune system is more strained during the winter months, and these ten supplements will prepare you for the battle ahead: - Vitamin D - Elderberry - Zinc - Vitamin C - Probiotics - Fish oil - DMG - Olive leaf extract - Astragalus - Cordyceps WHY IS OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WEAKER IN WINTER? Environmental changes impact the homeostasis of our internal processes. The colder months and longer, darker nights encourage us to rest and sleep more, giving our body the chance to restore and grow. While this cyclical period is natural and restorative, the lack of sunlight and physical activity can contribute to low moods and sluggish energy. Sunshine dependent nutrients like Vitamin D are sitting at lower levels in our cells, decreasing our immune function at a critical time of year. Breathing cold, dry air constricts the nasal capillaries and changes lung and immune function in the winter, leaving us more vulnerable to seasonal invaders. Meanwhile, many foreign pathogens thrive in colder temperatures, creating the perfect storm for respiratory discomforts to take hold. TOP 10 IMMUNE SUPPLEMENTS FOR WINTER 2023 We can't eliminate winter; instead, we should use supplements, dietary modifications, and activity shifts to strengthen our immune system as much as possible.* Here are the top 10 supplements for boosting immunity now that winter is upon us: - Vitamin D. This powerhouse antioxidant is made by the body when the skin is exposed to sunlight. Because the sun's rays are less direct and we spend less time outdoors in winter, it's crucial to supplement with a high-quality, [bioavailable Vitamin ](https://www.davincilabs.com/vitamin-d3-10-44-000-iu-30.html) [D](https://www.davincilabs.com/vitamin-d3-10-44-000-iu-30.html).* - Elderberry. A time-honored traditional herbal remedy, this nutrient-dense berry is used to lessen respiratory discomfort and shorten the length by around four days.* [[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15080016/) Because the unripe berries are toxic, make sure you choose a high-quality product from a trusted brand, like these family-friendly [lozenges](https://www.davincilabs.com/zinc-lozenge-elderberry-60.html). - Zinc. Supplementing with this mineral supports a healthy inflammatory response and keeps throat tissue healthy and comfortable.* [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2277319/) Find the recommended daily allowance of zinc in the above lozenges, which combine zinc with elderberry for boosted immune support.* - Vitamin C. This well-known antioxidant scavenges free radicals before they can harm the body through excessive oxidation. Vitamin C stimulates white blood cells to destroy pathogens while protecting our own cells.* We recommend this [liposomal vitamin C](https://www.davincilabs.com/liposomal-c-12.html) supplement for enhanced absorption in the body.* - Probiotics. Healthy gut flora promotes the integrity of the intestinal lining, protecting you from invaders trying to breach that thin wall to access your bloodstream. Try this [probiotic supplement](https://www.davincilabs.com/daily-best-probiotic-153-60.html) to balance and strengthen your delicate microbiome.* - Fish Oil. Rich in DHA and EPA, [Omega-3 fish oil supplements](https://www.davincilabs.com/omega-3-hp-d-120.html) boost various parts of the immune system's responses to pathologic invaders, encouraging macrophages to fully engulf and disable microbes.* [[3]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31614433/) - DMG. Dimethylglycine is an amino acid with an impressive track record for supporting metabolic functions in the body and bolstering immune function.* In an animal study, supplementing with DMG led to a 4x higher production of antibodies against a foreign microbe.* [[4]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1691258/) Conveniently and effectively supplement with an immune-focused blend like [Immuno-DMG](https://www.davincilabs.com/immuno-dmg-153-chewable-120.html).* - Olive Leaf Extract. Rich in polyphenols, [olive leaf extract](https://www.davincilabs.com/olivir-153-15.html) stimulates production of natural killer cells and interferon, supporting strong immune function in the body.* [[5]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29149822/) - Astragalus. Used around the world, astragalus is a popular herbal supplement in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Studies show this [adaptogenic herb](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/herb/astragalus#:~:text=Astragalus%20is%20used%20to%20protect,the%20skin%20for%20wound%20care.) leads to increased immune function against harmful microbes.* - Cordyceps. This mushroom packs a strong punch against foreign invaders. One study found a 38% boost in natural killer cells after supplementing with cordyceps for eight weeks.* [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30925876/) EXCELLENT FOODS TO BOOST IMMUNITY EXCELLENT FOODS TO BOOST IMMUNITY Supplements are a great way to effectively increase your intake of certain key nutrients or compounds, but choosing immune boosting foods is foundational. Many of the above-mentioned vitamins, minerals, and herbs can be incorporated into your dinner if you know what to look for. - Stinking Lilies. Onions, garlic, shallots, and leeks are all part of genus Allium of the Lily family. Rich in antioxidants, these foods support a healthy inflammatory function and immune response. - Ginger. This pungent root stimulates the secretion of lysozyme by the white blood cells called macrophages, helping to dismantle invading microbes. [[7]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31890918/) - Dark Leafy Greens. Spinach, kale, arugula, etc. are powerful immune system boosters and, frankly, full of beneficial nutrients. The dark leafy greens provide specific chemicals to the gut that encourage a robust immune function. [[8]](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(11)01136-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867411011366%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) - Mushrooms. Cordyceps, lion's mane, maitake, shitake, reishi, and turkey tail have all been shown to benefit immune health, mostly by modulating cytokines. [[9]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26770080/) - Orange and Red Fruits and Veggies. Dark greens shouldn't get all the credit. Citrus fruits and red peppers pack a powerful punch against seasonal invaders, too. As rich sources of antioxidants like beta carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin C, these colorful fruits and veggies help the immune system produce white blood cells to fight for you all winter. OUT-OF-THE BOX IMMUNE BOOSTING TIPS Foods and supplements comprise a solid foundation for a strong immune function during the winter months, but there's even more you can do to ramp it up.* Some other traditional ways to improve immunity and support health and wellness include regular acupuncture, massage and chiropractic sessions. Perhaps less common options include red light therapy, saline nasal flushes, and vitamin IV treatments. Ask your integrative or functional medicine doctor for more information and reputable providers of alternative and complementary remedies. CONCLUSION Winter puts a strain on our immune system, but you can take steps to prepare yourself now. Lower temperatures and less sunlight, coupled with less physical activity, can leave us feeling sluggish. Leaning into the restorative winter months and embracing the traditional hygge principles (sleep more, stress less, enjoy time with family and friends) is a great way to recharge before spring. Make sure you also eat nutrient-rich, immune-boosting foods to best support your body as it encounters dangerous microbes. Select a variety of high-quality, immune-boosting dietary supplements to activate your defense mechanisms even more.* Our body needs extra vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, and other key nutrients that are a bit harder to get in the winter for many of us. Regular supplementation is paramount for a happy and healthy winter season.* [1] Zakay-Rones Z, Thom E, Wollan T, Wadstein J.
