The company [Standard Process](http://www.standardprocess.com/) specializes in certified organic, high quality natural supplements that are used to improve your overall wellness. Orr Chiropractic has found that these supplements are an amazing way to support chiropractic care with nutritional education. These products give Dr. Julia's team an opportunity to impact the home health aspect of her nutritional plans. The [Standard Process 21 Day Purification Program](http://www.standardprocess.com/Standard-Process/Purification-Program) is used to stimulate specific detoxification of organs in the body- the liver, kidneys, skin and intestines. This is not a fad diet, but rather a jump-start to cleanse your body of poor eating habits and reintroduce the right foods into your diet systematically. How Do The Purification Programs Work? The 21 Day Purification Program includes eating whole, organic, and unprocessed foods, taking whole food supplements, and drinking plenty of water. We also give our patients lots of helpful information and tips to aid them through their cleanse such as recipes and therapies that assist with detoxification. The process begins with removing all unhealthy unnecessary food from your diet. Large amounts of water are recommended to begin flushing the system of the harmful products already within your body. As you progress through the program, you are able to introduce more of a variety of whole natural foods into your diet. For example, your meals at the start of the program are more restricted to vegetables and fruits, but by the end of the 21 day program you can include meat into your diet. This process teaches you the value of proper portions and nutrient distribution. In addition, using the standard process supplements gives you a better understanding of how you can benefit from adding in a natural source of nutrients in your diet. What is the SP Detox Balance Program This is either a 10 or 28 day program using the vegan SP Detox balance powder in a shake either once, twice or three times per day. Each shake has 17 grams of protein. It helps take the guesswork out of daily prep, so you can focus on making healthy choices. It comes with a book to guide you through the journey with recipes and helpful suggestions. 10 Day Inflammation Inflammation can be a healthy response to your body's signals to address challenges. However, inflammation can become the enemy if it is causing your body to overreact to stressors and creating a chronic inflammation response. When certain body parts need repaired, the cells release substances to stimulate the immune system to start the healing process. The 10-Day Inflammation Program will help jumpstart the healing process and put your body on the fast track to reducing inflammation and living a healthier, more active life! 10 Day Female Vitality Many women deal with the symptoms listed below on a regular or monthly basis.
