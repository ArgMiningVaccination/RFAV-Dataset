Answer: It can take up to ten years or longer for a vaccine to be developed, tested, and approved by Health Canada. Occasionally, the process can be expedited (happen more quickly) if a vaccine is urgently needed (for example, during a pandemic). No safety steps are skipped in these cases, and the vaccine must meet all the same safety requirements. An example is the COVID-19 vaccines. - Vaccines are among the most strictly regulated medical products in Canada. - All vaccines undergo an in-depth testing process and must be shown to be safe and effective before being approved for use in Canada. - This process goes through several phases to gather all the scientific information necessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. - Once a vaccine has been approved for use, and for as long as the vaccine is used, its safety is continuously monitored. - Canada has one of the best vaccine safety programs in the world.
