Our main objective was to identify high-risk groups of children who received no vaccines (zero-dose children). A decision tree approach was used for 92 low- and middle-income countries using data from Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, allowing the identification of groups of children aged 12-23 months at high risk of being zero dose (no doses of the four basic vaccines\u2014BCG, polio, DPT and measles). Three high-risk groups were identified in the analysis combining all countries. The group with the highest zero-dose prevalence (42%) included 4% of all children, but almost one in every four zero-dose children in the sample. It included children whose mothers did not receive the tetanus vaccine during and before the pregnancy, who had no antenatal care visits and who did not deliver in a health facility. Separate analyses by country presented similar results. Children who have been missed by vaccination services were also left out by other primary health care interventions, especially those related to antenatal and delivery care. There is an opportunity for better integration among services in order to achieve high and equitable immunization coverage.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-06-13", "cleaned_text": "Finding Children with High Risk of Non-Vaccination in 92 Low- and Middle-Income Countries: 2010 and 2018, it was estimated that the measles vaccine prevented about 23 million deaths, but large measles outbreaks occurred in all World Health Organization (WHO) regions in 2018 [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00646), [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00646)]. Since 2010, 116 countries have introduced vaccines not previously used, but coverage of essential vaccines have stagnated and polio has not yet been eradicated worldwide [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00646), [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00646)]. The COVID-19 pandemic, regional outbreaks of diseases such as the Ebola Virus Disease, and the threat of new pandemics represent an important challenge for health systems on the continuation and improvement of routine vaccination services in all countries [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00646)]. [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00646)]. Identifying risk groups for non-vaccination in LMICs could be useful for reducing inequalities and tailoring interventions that could reach and successfully vaccinate the children that are being left behind. Zero-dose children\u2014those who failed to receive any vaccine\u2014represent a particularly vulnerable group being left behind by multiple vaccination services and interventions. [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00646)]. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) are nationally representative household surveys that collect information on both vaccination and sociodemographic indicators that can be used for identifying risk groups of zero-dose children and their characteristics. According to 241 DHS and MICS surveys from 1986 to 2007 from 96 LMICs, the percentage of zero-dose children was 9.9% among those aged 12-59 months. Zero-dose status was generally more common in children from the poorest households and from mothers who were less educated, not vaccinated with the tetanus toxoid vaccine and who decided alone about child's care when the child was sick [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00646)]. [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00646)]. In the context of non-vaccination, decision trees can be used for identifying subgroups of children at a higher risk of being zero dose, without previous specification of what subgroups should be tested. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Source and Children Sample [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00646)]. We classified each country according to their World Bank income level using the median survey year, 2015 [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00646)]. 2.2. Outcome [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00646)]. Exceptions were Moldova (15-26 months) and Bosnia and Herzegovina, Costa Rica, Jamaica, North Macedonia and Ukraine (18-29 months), due to the fact that the measles vaccine was given at 15 and 18 months in those countries during the survey year, respectively. [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00646)]. 2.3. Potential Indicators of Vulnerability [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00646), [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00646), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00646)] and that can provide useful information for targeting and tailoring vaccination interventions. [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00646), [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00646)]. Separate PCAs are carried out for urban and rural settings in order to take into account the differences in relevance that household assets can have in those settings. The households are then divided into quintiles according to their wealth index [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00646)]. 2.4. Analysis Methods [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00646)] and created a world map to present those prevalences using R (R Core Team, 2020, version 4.0.2. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and publicly available geographics datasets [ [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00646)]. [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00646)]. For the identification of groups with high risk, CART performs a binary recursive partitioning process. This means that, using the indicators available for the analysis, it divides the sample into two groups (hence binary), one with a higher zero-dose prevalence and one with a lower, when compared to the original complete sample. The algorithm tests all the indicators and possible cut-off points (e.g., belonging to Q1 vs. Q2-Q5, belonging to Q1-Q2 vs. Q3-Q5, and so on). The best split is the one that maximizes within-group homogeneity. This process eliminates the necessity of previously specifying cut-off points for non-binary indicators and also allows for a specific stratification to happen within different subgroups of the sample, dealing naturally with the complex interactions of indicators. [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00646), [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00646)]. We made this specification in order to increase the tree sensitivity, even if accompanied by a reduction in specificity. Moreover, any split leading to a node with less than 50 children was discarded. [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00646)] in R (R Core Team, 2020, version 4.0.2. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). All the trees were created using sample weights that consider the complex survey design. The individual trees are presented in country profiles that also include the prevalence of key inequality and healthcare indicators. For the pooled analyses (prevalence and decision trees), we combined the datasets and adjusted the sample weights in order to take into consideration the number of children aged 12-23 months living in each country, as described in [Section A in the supplementary materials](#app1-vaccines-09-00646). 3. Results 3.1. Zero-Dose Prevalence [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00646-f001)and confidence intervals in [Table S1](#app1-vaccines-09-00646)in [Section B in the supplementary materials](#app1-vaccines-09-00646). 3.2. Pooled Decision Tree [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00646-f002)). Of all the 17 indicators included in the tree analyses, only three were selected to separate the children into risk groups: the number of tetanus vaccine doses received by the mother during or before the pregnancy of the child, the number of antenatal care visits, and the child's place of delivery. 3.3. Characterization of the Risk Groups [Figure 3](#vaccines-09-00646-f003). There were no statistically significant differences in terms of sex of the child among any groups. 3.4. Country-Specific Trees [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00646-t001). The 92 trees are presented in the country profiles in [supplementary Figures S1-S92](#app1-vaccines-09-00646)in [Section B](#app1-vaccines-09-00646). 4. Discussion [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00646)]. [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00646)]. Both vaccination and antenatal care services failed to reach and vaccinate these mothers during and before the index pregnancy, which contributes to the burden of maternal and neonatal tetanus [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00646)]. Furthermore, one in every four children of these mothers was also zero dose, therefore failing to achieve both short and long-term protection against tetanus for the child. [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00646)]. [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00646)] and 152 LMICs have a policy of universal neonatal vaccination at birth or at the first week of life [ [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00646)]. This is in accordance with our results: among children whose mothers have not been vaccinated against tetanus and who have had zero antenatal care visits, those who were born in a health facility had a zero-dose prevalence of 23% while those who were not had almost double the prevalence (42%). [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00646)] and their mothers are also less likely to receive qualified antenatal care [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00646)]. This result further indicates the level of vulnerability of the children in the higher risk groups, as their socioeconomic condition has also been associated with lower medical-treatment-seeking behavior [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00646)], worse nutritional status [ [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00646)], and higher mortality among unvaccinated children [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00646)]. [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00646)], with reports of increased vaccination coverage [ [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00646)] and detection of vulnerable populations [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00646), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00646)] after the adoption of the RED strategy. A proposed improvement to the RED strategy is the \"reach every community\" approach, with a focus on facility-level planning, monitoring of community access and utilization of vaccination services, local communication strategies and health networks that should allow for the tailoring of vaccination delivery systems according to the specific necessities of vulnerable communities [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00646)]. Those strategies are an opportunity to promote other maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) services, since community involvement can help to identify newborn and pregnant women that could be targets for those services [ [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00646)]. An example is the inclusion of a wider MNCH, environmental health, and water and sanitation package by planners involved in the application of the RED strategy in the Byanzurkh District in Mongolia, since they determined that both vaccination and MNCH services shared similar barriers in the district (distance, level of education, and poverty) [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00646)]. [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00646)] and is a more conservative approach, considering the risks of non-vaccination. 5.
