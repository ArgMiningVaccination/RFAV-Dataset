The process for updating the National Vaccine Plan included extensive opportunities for public engagement and comment to ensure the nation's vaccine enterprise reflected the expertise and priorities of multiple stakeholders. Draft Documents 2008 Draft Strategic National Vaccine Plan Public Comment The National Vaccine Plan process offered many opportunities for public comment. Comments received in writing by March 31, 2009 are organized by section of the draft strategic National Vaccine Plan, and then by organization/individual. In keeping with the notices soliciting comments, which provided that all information would be made public, NVPO has listed the name of each organization and the author(s) of each set of comments. Federal Register notices soliciting comment are available here: Comments by January 30; extension to March 31. National Vaccines Plan Public Comments Summary National Vaccine Plan Public Comments Table\u2014Organizations Public Engagement Activities Public engagement activities were an important part of Plan development and revision. Comments and input from members of the public contributed to the draft strategic National Vaccine Plan. The National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC), a federal advisory committee to HHS, was also involved in soliciting broad public input for the draft strategic Plan. Approaches utilized for public and stakeholder input included: Written comments - submitted by interested individuals and organizations Institute of Medicine expert panel convened to engage stakeholders and review priorities Three all-day dialogues that included a cross-section of the general public from different communities A February 6, 2009 meeting of the NVAC with stakeholders Institute of Medicine Review HHS directed the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine (IOM) to empanel an expert committee to assist in gathering stakeholder input. The committee reviewed the 1994 National Vaccine Plan and provided guidance on the development of the draft strategic Plan. The IOM committee also held a series of national meetings focused around each of the goals that yielded important insights and perspectives from a diverse group of stakeholders. On December 11, 2009, the Institute of Medicine issued a report, Priorities for the National Vaccine Plan. These recommendations from the IOM were considered as the Plan was finalized in 2010. Community Dialogues HHS representatives and the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education developed three public engagement meetings to solicit public input on the National Vaccine Plan. Public engagement meetings took place in St. Louis, Missouri, on March 14, 2009; Columbus, Ohio, on March 28, 2009; and Syracuse, New York, on April 4, 2009. These locations were chosen in order to hear from people in different parts of the country and who may have different perspectives on vaccine and immunization issues. The meetings included roughly 250 community members in total. Participants were sought through outreach from a variety of community networks, including health care providers, school-based and home-school-based organizations, alternative medicine providers, and the local media. Public meetings lasted a full day and included educational presentations, small group deliberations, and full group discussions. The primary objective was to identify participants' values and concerns, which contributed to prioritization of scientific activities in the draft strategic National Vaccine Plan.
