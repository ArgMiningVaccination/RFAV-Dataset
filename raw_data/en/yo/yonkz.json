When your body responds to treatment, you may have a complete or partial remission, where your myeloma is under control and isn't currently progressing. After a period of being in remission, it is possible for multiple myeloma to relapse or not respond to your current treatment (sometimes called \"refractory\"). When this happens, there may be other treatments available, which may include SARCLISA, that have been studied specifically in people with previously treated multiple myeloma. Find out about steps you can take to support your physical and emotional health while living with multiple myeloma. Living With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma is a guide featuring practical tips on staying active, eating a healthy and enjoyable diet, and supporting your emotional well-being.
