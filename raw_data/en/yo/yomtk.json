It has devastated the economy and taken a terrible toll on countless families who have lost loved ones or livelihoods. The fastest way to end the pandemic is for everyone to take every step possible\u2014wear a mask, social-distance, wash your hands...and get a vaccine when it's available to you. In clinical studies, the vaccines virtually eliminated COVID deaths and hospitalizations once the shots reached their full effect. The vaccine is free to receive, whether or not you have health insurance. You owe it to yourself and your loved ones to avoid getting severe COVID. How can I get the COVID-19 vaccine or boosters? Hoosiers ages 6 months and older may receive vaccination and bivalent booster shot, if eligible. Schedule an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccine/booster at your Community primary care provider's office. Appointments are required at provider offices. What vaccines do I need if I am immunocompromised? The CDC recommends people whose immune systems are moderately to severely compromised receive additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Recommendations vary based on age, primary vaccine series and immunocompromised status. See the CDC website for recommendations on vaccines/booster for immunocompromised populations. How do I prepare for a vaccine appointment? If you are feeling ill with cold- or flu-like symptoms, you should not come for your vaccine until you are feeling well again. We cannot vaccinate patients with a fever of 100.4 or greater. Please follow these guidelines for your vaccine appointment: Ages 6 months and older are currently eligible to receive the primary vaccine series and bivalent booster shot, if eligible. Vaccine brand options may vary by age and other eligibility. Appointments are required at Community primary care offices. Bring your insurance card and ID. Wear clothing that allows access to the arms (i.e., a t-shirt or tank top). Wear a mask. After your vaccination is complete, you must remain at the location for 15 minutes. What precautions should I take after receiving the vaccine? People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose in a 2-dose series, such as Pfizer or Moderna, or 2 weeks after a single-dose vaccine such as Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine. If you do not meet these requirements, please continue to take precautions, such as mask wearing, hand hygiene and social distancing, until you're fully vaccinated. If fully vaccinated: Please follow your workplace and local business guidelines on mask regulations. If you travel, try to take steps to protect yourself. Masks are recommended on planes, busses, and other forms of public transportation. You should still watch for symptoms of COVID-19. People who have a weakened immune system should speak with their healthcare team to discuss what is best for them. They may need to continue precautions like wearing masks and frequently disinfecting. Efficacy, or effectiveness, rates differ across the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. But what's most important to remember, is that in clinical trials for all three vaccines, all were effective at preventing serious outcomes (hospitalizations and deaths) from COVID-19. Does the vaccine protect me from Omicron and other variants? While the Omicron variants are more transmissible and spread more easily than the Delta variant, current vaccines still protect against severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths due to infection from variants. Breakthrough infections can still occur but the best way to protect yourself from Omicron and other COVID-19 variants is to: Get vaccinated and boosted. The CDC recommends COVID-19 primary series vaccines and booster shots for everyone ages 6 months and older, if eligible (depends on primary series).Review booster eligibility by age. Get tested and isolate if you are ill. Avoid or social distance in crowded or indoor spaces. Wear a mask around others. Wash your hands frequently. Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe? The CDC has deemed the COVID-19 vaccines as safe and effective. The CDC along with additional partners has an extensive safety monitoring program (the largest in U.S. history), that tracks any reported effects. All rare cases of adverse effects reported include: Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) after COVID-19 vaccination is rare. It has occurred in around 5 cases per one million vaccine doses administered in the U.S. Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after J&J/JanssenCOVID-19 vaccination is rare. It has occurred in around 4 cases per one million vaccine doses administered in the U.S. Myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. As of December 15, 2022 there have been 702 verified reports of myocarditis among people ages 5 - 18. Reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. With more than 660 million doses administered, there were 18,007 reports of death, or 0.0027%. However, it is unclear if the vaccine is related to these instances and it is being investigated. How was the vaccine developed and approved so quickly? It's true that we developed a vaccine remarkably quickly, less than a year after the first known cases of COVID. This does not mean corners were cut, nor unsafe shortcuts taken. Though this particular virus is new, researchers have been studying this family of coronaviruses for a decade, so they already knew the best way to target a vaccine when the current virus emerged. The vaccine technology itself also had already been developed and was standing by for just this kind of situation. For example, the same type of technology used in America's first COVID vaccines has proven safe and effective in preventing cases of deadly Ebola in Africa. The mRNA technology has been found to work more effectively with our immune system than older vaccine technologies. The clinical studies of the vaccines were not rushed, but were conducted in the normal length of time. Some were paused to investigate unusual illnesses\u2014and that, in fact, is normal for clinical studies, a sign that the studies were being conducted properly. Also helping vaccines arrive so quickly: Millions of dollars were invested so multiple teams could work simultaneously and share the tasks, the government began its review of the studies right away once they were submitted, and factories already were working on vaccines during governmental reviews so shipments could begin immediately. Can I expect side effects? Short-term minor side effects reported included soreness at injection site, fever, tiredness, headache, muscle ache, joint pain, fever, nausea or vomiting. Any side effects would typically occur within one to three days of injection and usually don't last more than a couple of days. The COVID-19 vaccine is not a live vaccine, which means you cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine. If you do experience side effects, that doesn't mean you have COVID or that the vaccine isn't working. It just means your body is building up its ability to fight COVID (and your body is getting itself ready even if you don't experience side effects). Remember, minor side effects for a day or two is far better than getting COVID. Currently, there are no contraindications for people with the following health conditions, and vaccination would still be encouraged: Patients receiving chemotherapy People with autoimmune diseases People with shingles, or in the middle of a two-dose shingles vaccine Women of childbearing years Women who are trying to conceive The vaccine is not recommended for those who suffer from severe allergic reactions. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding it is recommended you review the risk/benefit you have regarding receiving the vaccine. Learn more in our pregnancy and COVID-19 blog. Your primary care provider can help you make an informed personal decision about receiving the vaccination. You may also call the IDOH Epidemiology Resource Center at 877-826-0011. Can I choose which vaccine I want? Community Health Network currently administers the Pfizer vaccine. State-run community locations may administer a variety of brands; please inquire with your scheduled location. How much does the COVID-19 vaccine cost? The vaccine will be free, but your insurance information will be collected. I tested positive for COVID-19. When can I get the vaccine? If you have had COVID or been treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days after being positive before being vaccinated. If you are diagnosed with a COVID-19 positive test after receiving the first dose of vaccination, it is recommended that you still receive the second dose at the scheduled time.
