The 2012 i nternational r esearch Congress on integrative m edicine and Health (ir CimH), sponsored by the Consortium of academic Health Centers for i ntegrative m edicine (CaHCim), drew 1022 attendees from 30 countries. The meeting also served as the 7th i nternational Congress on Complementary m edicine r esearch, in association with the international Society of Complementary m edicine r esearch (iSCmr). The meeting's growth is anchored in the rising membership of the sponsoring Consortium. m ember institutions jumped from 30 six years ago to 54 in 2012. in little more than a decade, the small set of pioneering institutions has grown to become an undeniable, durable subpresence in academic medicine. a second contributor to this significant turn out is the ongoing commitment of the Consortium's planners to multidisciplinary and interprofessional engagement. a mong the 43 Participating Organizations were numerous discipline-specific research organizations and professional associations from such fields as chiropractic, acupuncture and oriental medicine, naturopathic medicine, massage therapy, yoga therapy and diverse creative arts therapies groups. n early 40% of respondents to a post conference survey indicated a principal affiliation with one or another of these complementary and alternative healthcare fields. irCimH's commitment to interprofessional teamwork in the Congress's development is publicly evident in the make-up of its program committees and the breadth of accepted content. a lso noteworthy is a partnership that the planning team, led by a viad (a di) Haramati, PhD, created with the a cademic Consortium for Complementary and a lternative Health Care (a CCaHC). The CaHCim extended 24 scholarships to investigators from the licensed complementary and alternative healthcare disciplines. remarkably, a conference sponsored by an academic medical organization has essentially been adopted as \"their\" meeting by at least a half-dozen other health care professional groups. The event is an exemplar as US healthcare begins to more significantly engage interprofessional education, practice and team approaches. The third factor was the decision to rename the conference (see \"Behind a Change in the m eeting's t itle\" on page 4). The title for 2012 asserts an affirmative, international engagement with front-line issues in medicine related to integrative care and to health. \"During our nursing luncheon, my 'aha' moment was how much more nurses might do in integrative medicine if we go together, joined hands and worked collectively in this field!\" All quotations in this summary have been taken from the conference evaluations completed by the attendees. Continued >> Plenary speakers lived up to this promise. Those choosing to attend had the opportunity to hear about the neurobiology of stress, ethical use of placebos, and the links between emotions, diet, exercise and health. t wo sessions on comparative effectiveness research methods were particularly relevant to researchers in this emerging, patient-centered science focused on evaluating the role of integrative modalities, systems and disciplines in advancing human health. numerous respondents to the post-Congress survey considered it \"excellent, \" \"the best\" or a \"must\" for those in the complementary and integrative medicine fields. One suggested that it is a \"can't miss for anyone who has skin in the game of integrative health. \" These appear to certainly be true. But the trend-lines here suggest that this scientific meeting is also becoming a \"can't miss\" for anyone who wishes to perch on the bowsprit of the medical system's still tentative movement into understanding the interprofessional, integrative and health domains that this meeting is increasingly exploring. Research on Integrative Medicine & Health Crosses a New Threshold << Continued from previous page 4\"Great experience... increased my interest in and appreciation for Eastern approaches to medicine.\" Behind the Change in the Title The previous two iterations of the Congress, in Edmonton, Alberta (2006) and Minneapolis, Minnesota (2009) were organized as the North American Research Congress on Complementary and Integrative Medicine. The title change for 2012 captured the evolution in both the event and the field. International reflected attendee demographics and meeting content. Twenty-four nations were represented in 2009. The 2012 event eventually drew from 30 countries. The term reflects the global origins of practices, products, scientific projects and investigators. The addition of health reflected findings of an NIH-CDC study that revealed a significant percentage of consumers utilize complementary and alternative agents and practitioners for health maintenance, wellness, health enhancement and promotion. The survey findings reflect practitioner self-perceptions captured in discussions at the February 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) Summit on Integrative Medicine and the Health of the Public. Medicine by itself did not adequately capture the transformative intention of many of these practices. The IOM report found that many in the field urge for integrative health as a more appropriate and inclusive title. Notably, the shift in language parallels Congressional usage in the 2010 Affordable Care Act which includes multiple references to \"integrative health,\" \"integrative health care,\" \"integrative health practices,\" practitioners.\" 2012 International Research Congress on Integrative Medicine and Health captured these evolutions.

The theory holds that, in the moment of experience, positive emotions expand people's awareness (the broaden effect) and that, over time, moments of expanded awareness accumulate and compound to increase people's resources for living well (the build effect). e xperiments from multiple laboratories now support the broaden effect of positive emotions, using behavioral measures as well as eye-tracking and brain imaging. m ore recently, field experiments have tested the build effect of positive emotions, finding that people can reliably increase their daily diets of positive emotions through the contemplative practice of loving-kindness meditation, and by doing so, they nourish growth in their personal resources. i mproved resources, including perceived mindfulness, environmental mastery, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, and physical health, in turn contribute to increases in life satisfaction and reductions in depressive symptom. m oving beyond self-reported resources, a recent field experiment finds that the practice of loving-kindness meditation also increases people's cardiac vagal tone, a biological marker of health and flexible self-regulatory capacity. These new data deepen the evidence that contemplative practices transform enduring biological functioning in ways that may promote both mental and physical health.

Studies have shown that chronic exposure to stress is associated with reduced volume of the hippocampus and that acute and chronic stress can modulate volumes of both the amygdala and frontal cortex. The negative effects of chronic stress on the hippocampus has led to the ' neurotoxicity Hypothesis' , whereby chronic exposure to stress can lead to hippocampal atrophy. However, recent studies show that reduced hippocampal volume can actually be pre-determined early in life and increase vulnerability to develop stress-related mental health disorders in face of adversity during adulthood (the 'Vulnerability Hypothesis'). We have recently suggested that exposure to early adversity could delay the development of various brain regions through a neurotoxic process, leading to reduced brain volumes as measured in adulthood. These reduced brain volumes in adulthood could increase vulnerability to develop mental health disorders in the face of adversity during adult life (called the 'Life-Cycle m odel of Stress'). Dr. Lupien presented data showing that early exposure to maternal depression has significant impact on brain volumes in 10 years old children, thus giving support to this model. Based on these data, her laboratory is now developing and/or studying the effects of various interventions aiming at decreasing stress hormones levels in children and teenagers in order to prevent the deleterious effects of chronic stress on brain development. Biography Sonia Lupien, PhD is the founder and director of the Centre for Studies on Human Stress (www.humanstress.ca), and she holds a position as Senior investigator Chair on m ental Health in Women and m en from the Canadian institutes of Health r esearch. For the last 20 years, Dr. Lupien has been studying the effects of stress on the human brain, from infancy to adulthood and old age. i n her new research projects, Dr. Lupien is working on differences between men and women in stress reactivity, and she is developing new educational programs on stress in adolescents and workers. \"Sonia Lupien's presentation on stress was excellent.

We just need a ritual to tap into our innate ability to heal ourselves. I will use this when talking to patients and students.\"Placebo Therapy as an Ethical Alternative Irving Kirsch, PhD associate Director, Program in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic encounter Harvard m edical School Beth i srael Deaconess m edical Center, Boston, ma, USa Professor emeritus, University of Hull & University of Connecticut Sponsored in part by: Presentation Overview The ethics of using placebos in clinical trials and in clinical practice have been challenged. The challenge to clinical trials is based on the concern that effective treatment is being withheld from patients given placebos. i n fact, effective treatment may be withheld from patients given the active drug in clinical trials. Were this not a possibility, there would be no need for the trial. m ore important, giving a placebo may be more ethical than giving the active drug in a clinical trial. This is the case when placebo effects are substantial for the condition being treated, when the effects of existing drugs are not much better than those of placebo, and when the active drug produces side effects and other risks that are not produced by placebo. Clinical trials of antidepressants are examined as an exemplar of this situation. i n clinical practice, the ethical concern is based on the presumption that effective administration of placebos requires deception. Three ways of overcoming this obstacle to clinical exploitation of the placebo effect are explored. First, recent data indicate that placebo pills can be given to patients openly, without either explicit or implicit deception, and can still produce substantial clinical benefits. Second, placebo effects can be elicited without the use of placebos by enhancing the therapeutic relationship and increasing patient confidence in the effectiveness of the treatment. Third, hypnosis can be used as a non-deceptive placebo to enhance therapeutic outcome. Biography irving Kirsch, PhD is a ssociate Director of the Program in Placebo Studies at the Harvard m edical School and Professor emeritus at the University of Hull and the University of Connecticut. He has published 10 books and more than 200 scientific journal articles and book chapters on placebo effects, antidepressant medication, hypnosis, and suggestion. Dr. Kirsch's meta-analyses on the efficacy of antidepressants were covered extensively in the international media and influenced official guidelines for the treatment of depression in the United Kingdom. His book, The Emperor's New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth , which has been published in english, French, and Japanese, was shortlisted for the prestigious m ind Book of the y ear award. i t was the topic of a five-page cover story in n ewsweek, and was favorably reviewed in the n ew y ork r eview of Books by m arcia a ngell, former editor-in- chief of the n ew england Journal of m edicine. 13COngreSS Keyn Ote PreS entati OnS Thursday, May 17 | 08:15 - 09:00 Presentation Overview Comparative effectiveness research (or \"Cer \") is the type of clinical research that most directly impacts clinical practice and/or public policy. We can understand what Cer is by focusing on the three letters: \"C\" stands for comparison, contest, or choice among existing options for diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, or management of medical conditions; \" e\" stands for effectiveness, meaning outcomes relevant to patients (such as mortality, morbidity, or quality of life) or health care systems within real-world settings; and \" r\" stands for research, meaning randomized trials, observational studies, or systematic syntheses of existing research. Cer has drawn much attention recently because of its explicit inclusion in the 2009 a merican r ecovery and reinvestment a ct (arra) and the 2010 a ffordable Care a ct, which led to the formation of the non-governmental, non-profit Patient-Centered Outcomes research i nstitute (\"PCO ri\"). Cer has also drawn controversy, as some have criticized it of creating \"death panels\" that would lead to the withholding of expensive health services from patients. Despite the recent attention, Cer is in fact nothing new. Critical physicians and policy makers have noted for many years (centuries in fact) that doctors often adopt technologies and services in the absence of rigorous scientific evidence. examples among many include bloodletting, anti-arrhythmic drugs, hormone- replacement therapy, bone marrow transplantation for metastatic breast cancer, anti-oxidant vitamins to prevent cancer, and intracranial stents after stroke. i n each of these cases, rigorous large-scale comparative effectiveness trials were needed to evaluate value. i n other cases, rigorous Cer trials established value: examples include revascularization for acute myocardial infarction, and more recently helical Ct for lung cancer screening. Cer is the center of a number of policy questions, including prioritization, role of stakeholders, governance, implementation, role of observational data, and incorporation of personalized medicine.

Furthermore, a number of treatment options that may well be helpful are not widely available or covered by insurance because their benefits and risks have not been adequately evaluated. m ost studies in traditional, complementary and integrative medicine were designed to detect specific effects of these interventions and are not very useful for clinical decision-making in a usual care setting. a n important contributor to the evidence gaps for clinical decision- making is the historical lack of engagement of decision makers in developing research priorities, refining research questions, and crafting study protocols. Comparative effectiveness research and patient-centered outcomes research are relatively recent attempts to meaningfully engage decision makers in the process of evidence development. The core premise of this approach to research is, for example, to learn from patients what outcomes are most relevant to them, from clinicians which comparators are the most common options they consider, and asking payers what patient characteristics would be most helpful to reflect in the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. These insights are then reflected in how clinical studies are designed. r apid improvements in the quality and consistency of evidence may be achieved by collaborative efforts between clinicians, patients and researches to develop consensus on the optimal approaches to conducting research for specific categories of health interventions. Work of this kind in now underway in the field of integrative medicine (acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine) and a number of other clinical domains.

Data contributing to the science of inactivity, activity and health come from a wide range of experimental and observational studies that provide the evidence needed to support strong clinical and public health physical activity guidelines. While the effects of physical activity closely interact with other health behaviors or conditions such as nutrition, mental stress and obesity, physical activity provides independent and unique health benefits. m ost data showing lower chronic disease rates in more active persons come from prospective observational studies. However, numerous well-executed experimental studies have demonstrated the favorable effects of increased activity on a wide range of biomarkers considered to be in the causal pathways between the change in activity and the disease process for major chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke and type-2 diabetes. While strong associations and some experimental data exist linking physical activity to many other chronic conditions such as colon cancer, breast cancer, depression, and dementia, less is understood about potential biological mechanism for these benefits. much of the research between the 1950s and 2000 focused on the health benefits and risks of moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity (mVP a), but recently a major research emphasis has been on the health risks associated with sedentary behavior, primarily sustained sitting. Preliminary data indicate that reducing sitting time and inserting \"breaks\" throughout the day may provide health benefits independent of mVP a. Based on extensive systematic reviews of the scientific literature physical activity guidelines have published by a number of developed countries (e.g., USa, Canada, UK, Brazil) and for developing countries by the World Health Organization with excellent harmonization across guidelines.

However, this advice was inconsistent with many lines of evidence indicating that unsaturated fats have beneficial metabolic effects and reduce risk of coronary heart disease. more recent evidence has also shown that the large majority of carbohydrates in current industrial diets, consisting of refined starches and sugar, have adverse metabolic effects and increase risks of obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. also, red meat consumption is associated with increased risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, some cancers, and total mortality, and replacement of red meat with nuts and legumes is strongly associated with lower risk of these outcomes. Thus, in an optimal diet, most calories would come from a balance of whole grains and plant oils, and proteins would be provided by a mix of nuts, beans, fish, eggs, and poultry. Higher intake of fruits and vegetables (not including potatoes) is associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease, although the benefits for cancer prevention appear to be less than anticipated. a shift from the current US diet to a more optimal way of eating would have a profoundly beneficial effect on health and wellbeing of a mericans. This shift would also reduce the many adverse environmental impacts of our current diet. Biography Walter Willett, mD, mPH, Dr.Ph, is Professor of e pidemiology and n utrition and Chairman of the Department of n utrition at Harvard School of Public Health and Professor of m edicine at Harvard m edical School. Dr. Willett, an american, was born in Hart, m ichigan and grew up in m adison, Wisconsin, studied food science at m ichigan State University, and graduated from the University of m ichigan m edical School before obtaining a Doctorate in Public Health from Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Willett has focused much of his work over the last 25 years on the development of methods, using both questionnaire and biochemical approaches, to study the effects of diet on the occurrence of major diseases. He has applied these methods starting in 1980 in the n urses' Health Studies i and ii and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. t ogether, these cohorts that include nearly 300,000 men and women with repeated dietary assessments are providing the most detailed information on the long-term health consequences of food choices. Dr. Willett has published over 1,100 articles, primarily on lifestyle risk factors for heart disease and cancer, and has written the textbook, Nutritional Epidemiology , published by Oxford University Press. He also has three books book for the general public, e at, Drink and Be Healthy: The Harvard m edical School g uide to Healthy e ating, which has appeared on most major bestseller lists, e at, Drink, and Weigh Less, co-authored with m ollie Katzen, and most recently, The Fertility Diet, co-authored with Jorge Chavarro and Pat Skerrett. Dr. Willett is the most cited nutritionist internationally, and is among the five most cited persons in all fields of clinical science. He is a member of the institute of m edicine of the n ational a cademy of Sciences and the recipient of many national and international awards for his research. 17PrOgram at a gLanCe Tuesday, May 15 09:00 - 17:00 Full Day Pre-Congress Workshop Advancing Research Literacy 09:00 - 12:00 Morning Pre-Congress WorkshopsEvidence-based CAM: State of the Science of Chiropractic, Naturopathic and Traditional East Asian Medicine Clinical Hypnosis as an Adjunct in Peri-Operative Medicine and Pain Management in Children, Adolescents and Adult Patients Health Coaching: State of the Science 14:00 - 17:00 Afternoon Pre-Congress WorkshopsWriting a CAM Grant: Challenges in Clinical Trial Design and Important Statistical Considerations Systematic Review Research Methods Training: Focus on CAM Fostering Empathy: A Hands-On Training for Healthcare Professionals 18:30 - 20:00 Welcome Reception 06:30 - 07:15 Experiential Sessions: Yoga | Tai Chi | Meditation 07:00 - 08:00 Continental Breakfast 08:00 - 08:15 Opening Remarks 08:15 - 09:00 Plenary Session 01:\"How Positive Emotions Heal\" Barbara Fredrickson 09:00 - Neurobiology to Interventions\"Sonia Lupien 09:45 - 10:30 Poster Viewing and Coffee Break 10:30 - 12:00 Concurrent Sessions Advances in Integrative Cardiology: State of the Science Standardizing Competencies for Integrative Medicine Clinical Fellowships Tools for Measuring and Enhancing Contextual Factors in Healing A Window to the Brain: Neuroimaging Technologies for Integrative Medicine Research Strengthening Integrative Medicine and Health across the US Military with Research, Evidence, and Collaboration Conducting Research in Integrative Medicine Clinical Practices: Lessons Learned and Future DirectionsWednesday, May 16 Continued >>\"My 'aha' moment was that what is going on outside of the conference (networking, socializing, eating) is almost as important as the conference itself.
