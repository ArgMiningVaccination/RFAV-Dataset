Articial chromosomes and minichromosome-like episomes are large DNA molecules capable of containing whole genomic loci, and be maintained as nonintegrating, replicating molecules in proliferating human somatic cells. Authentic human articial chromosomes are very di cult to engineer because of the di culties associated with centromere structure, so they are not widely used for gene-therapy applications. However, OriP/EBNA1-based episomes, which they lack true centromeres, can be maintainedstably in dividing cells as they bind to mitotic chromosomes and segregate into daughter cells. These episomes are more easily engineered than true human articial chromosomes and can carry entire genes along with all their regulatory sequences. Thus, these constructs may facilitate the long-term persistence and phys iological regulation of the expression of therapeutic genes, which is crucial for some gene therapy applications. In particular, they are promising vectors for gene therapy in inherited diseases that are caused by recessive mutations, for example haemophilia A and Friedreich's ataxia. Interestingly, episome carrying the frataxin gene (decient in Friedreich's ataxia) has been demonstrated to rescue the susceptibility to oxidative stress which is typical ofbroblasts from Friedreich's ataxia patients. This provides evidence of their potential to treat genetic diseases linked to recessivemutations through gene therapy. 1. The Rationale behind the Use of Large DNA Molecules in Gene Therapy Gene therapy is dened as the transfer of nucleic acid molecules (usually DNA) to a patients somatic cells inorder to prevent, treat, or alleviate a specic condition.Dierent gene therapy strategies have been designed to suit dierent types of diseases, the most \"classical\" of which involves gene delivery to target cells in order to obtainoptimal expression of the gene introduced. This therapeuticapproach is particularly well suited for inherited diseases thatare caused by recessive mutations, since these are typicallyassociated with the absence of a functional gene product orthe drastic decrease in the expression of a gene. In thesecases, the \"therapeutic gene\" must be inserted within a DNAmolecule (usually a bacterial plasmid) along with all itsessential regulatory sequences in order to ensure the correct expression of the gene in the target cells. T o facilitate theadequate cellular uptake of DNA molecules, they must bepacked within appropriate \"gene delivery vehicles\" . Viral vectors have become the preferred \"gene delivery vehicles\" in the eld of gene therapy due to their extremely high e ciency of gene transfer in somatic cells. However, viral vectors fail to full all the requirements for an \"optimal\"gene therapy vector. Ideally, the best gene therapy protocolwould involve a single administration of the therapeuticgene to the organism, such that it could replicate and seg-regate alongside the endogenous chromosomes, if necessary,thereby permitting long-term maintenance in any dividingcell. However, most viral vectors are either nonintegratingepisomes that are unable to replicate, segregate, and persistin dividing cells, or they are integrating vectors. These latter2 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology vectors insert into the chromosomes of the host cell, and although they can therefore persist in proliferating cells, theycarry the risk of producing insertional mutagenesis. Adenoviruses are DNA viruses that have a linear double- stranded 36 kb genome. These viruses can be used asnonintegrating vectors since their genome is maintained as an episome once it is released into the nucleus of the host cell. However, these episomes are lost after several cell divisions.Moreover, the rst-generation adenoviral vectors eliciteda strong immune response that led to elimination of thetransduced cells, and the humoral response excluded themafter future administrations [ 1,2]. T o diminish or overcome this reaction, multiple deletions have been introduced intothe subsequent generations of high-capacity [ 3] \"gutless\" adenoviral vectors [ 4,5]. Nevertheless, while these vectors can now infect a wide range of cells, their lack of persistencein dividing cells represents an important weakness. Retroviral-based vectors are capable of transducing a wide variety of dividing cells and they are e ciently inte- grated in the genome of the host cells [ 6]. However, this latter characteristic represents their major disadvantage sincerandom integration may cause insertional mutagenesis, andthe ensuing activation and/or silencing of undesirable genesmight even trigger oncogenic transformation in the host cells[7,8]. Indeed, some patients treated with retroviral vectors in a clinical trial for severe combined immunodeciency(SCID) developed leukemia as a consequence of vectorintegration [ 9]. While Lentiviruses belong to the retrovirus family, they are able to transduce both proliferating and non- proliferating cells, augmenting the range of target cells [ 10, 11]. These viruses are currently the most widely used gene therapy vectors, as they sometimes permit prolonged geneexpression, although gradually silencing of gene expressionhas also been reported on occasion [ 12]. Finally, most viral vectors have a limited packaging capacity and they cannot accommodate large genes. Forthis reason, most constructs used for gene therapy are\"minigenes\" , consisting of cDNA sequences (instead of entiregenes) under the control of heterologous promoters (usuallysmall compacted promoter sequences of viral origin). These\"minigene constructs\" often exhibit variable expressionor lack tissue specicity, and they may not be properlyregulated in somatic cells, being completely \"silenced\" inmany cases, which obviously restricts their usefulness ingene therapy. Indeed, studies performed in transgenic micehave demonstrated that these \"minigene constructs\" are verysusceptible to being switched o by neighbouring chromatin [13]. On the other hand, there are cases where the cDNA is too big to be contained in one of these vector systems andsome \"nonessential\" regions have to be eliminated [ 14]. By contrast, studies performed in transgenic mice have highlighted the advantages of using large fragments ofgenomic DNA that permit the delivery of intact mammalian genes with all their introns, promoters, enhancers, and long-range controlling elements. By using gene's normalpromoter and controlling elements, the level and control ofexpression is comparable to the endogenous expression ofthe gene. The experience gained from using yeast articialchromosomes (YACs) and bacterial articial chromosomes (BACs) has shown that large genomic fragments drivetissue-specic expression at endogenous levels [ 15-20]. For example, transgenic mice carrying the intact human cysticbrosis transmembrane regulator gene ( CFTR ), which spans 200 kb of a 300 kb YAC [ 21], express CFTR in an appropriate tissue specic manner and complement the cftrdefect in null mice. Similar physiological expression has also been achievedwith the Huntingtin gene, which has been di cult to express from minigene constructs [ 22]. Likewise, the use of a YAC or BAC carrying the entire frataxin gene has rescued frataxin knock-out mice from embryonic lethality [ 16,19]. In view of these data, large DNA molecules seem to be better candidatesas vectors for gene therapy than the typical viral vectors, withtheir limited capacity. A sar e s u l to ft h eh u m a ng e n o m ep r o j e c t ,B A C sa r e available that cover the whole genome. Given that the averagesize of a BAC is approximately 150 kb, most genes, togetherwith all their regulatory elements, can be included in sucha construction. A system for linking overlapping BACs byhomologous recombination in E. coli has been described for when a BAC containing a whole locus is not available, or if new regions need to be added upstream or downstreamof a given gene within a BAC [ 23-25]. Also recombination has been used to modify BACs with di erent tags, which is very useful in studies of protein-protein or DNA-proteininteractions, and of protein localization [ 26]. This paper will deal with mammalian articial chromo- somes and minichromosome-like episomes. We will focus on the use of BACs containing genomic loci as a platform for the design of articial minichromosome-like vectors for gene therapy applications, and on the\"delivery vehicles\" that can accommodate such large DNAmolecules. We will also analyse two examples of applicationsof these articial minichromosome-like vectors for rare genetic diseases (haemophilia A and Friedreich's ataxia). 2. Mammalian Articial Chromosomes An obvious vector to stably carry large genomic DNA fragments would be an articial minichromosome thatmust have a replication origin and a centromere, enablingthe DNA molecule to replicate during S phase and tocorrectly segregate during mitosis. In addition, if the DNAmolecule is lineal telomeres must be present at both ends to guarantee its stability. The centromere is the most important chromosomal element since it is crucial for the attachmentof chromosomes to the mitotic spindle and their correctsegregation in mitosis. Centromeric DNA binds the CENPproteins that form the sca old for the kinetochore, the structure connecting the centromere to the spindle micro-tubules. Articial chromosomes have been built in yeastwithout any di culty, since yeast chromosomes contain small centromeres. However, mammalian centromeres arevery large and extraordinarily di cult to engineer, which has complicated the construction of mammalian articialchromosomes (MACs) or human articial chromosomes(HACs) [ 27].Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 3 2.1. Chromosomal Elements. All normal human centromeres contain large arrays of alphoid satellite DNA ( -DNA), a family of repetitive DNA sequences rst discovered in theAfrican green monkey [ 28]. Satellite DNA corresponds to only a small fraction of the human genome (less than2%) whereas in other species like the rat, it is much more abundant [ 29]. Human -DNA consists of tandem repeats of a 171 bp monomer arranged in highly ordered repeats [ 30, 31]. The divergent intermonomeric sequences lying between the independent monomers vary from 20% to 40% whereasthe sequence divergence is around 5% in the higher orderrepeats [ 32]. Despite this monomeric variation, each human centromere is thought to be formed by arrays of a uniquemonomer spanning from several kilobases up to megabases[33,34]. Several attempts to generate articial chromosomes have used alphoid DNA arrays from di erent chromosomes (X, Y, 17, and 21), although not all have succeeded. Alphoid DNAfrom chromosome Y has failed to form active centromeresin some cases [ 35,36], probably because of the lack of CENP-B boxes [ 37]. Masumoto and collaborators have also showed how two di erent alphoid DNA loci from the same chromosome behave in a completely opposite manner. Theyfound that alphoid-derived YAC unable to form HACs do nothave CENP-B boxes in addition to a more diverged alphoidrepeats [ 38]. In terms of specic DNA sequences, alphoid DNA may not be the only element needed for centromeres to fulltheir function, implicating additional mechanisms [ 39]. This view is supported by the lack of a consensus sequence for - DNA [ 32], the existence of dicentric chromosomes with two identical regions of - D N Ab u to n l yo n ea c t i v ec e n t r o m e r e [40-42], or the fact that functional neocentromeres can be formed from noncentromeric DNA [ 43]. However, it is clear that no DNA other than alphoid DNA can e ciently form a centromere after transfection into human cells. It has beenalready mention that not all alphoid DNAs can form activecentromeres with the same e ciency and it appears that functional centromeres required a minimum size, estimatedto be around 100 kb [ 44]. Lo and collaborators analysed all chromosomes in order to determine the minimumlength of alphoid DNA tolerated by chromosomes andstill able to seed de novo centromere formation [ 45]. In general, chromosomes cannot bear an important reductionin the length of alphoid DNA array, with the exception ofchromosome 21 whose alphoid DNA could oscillate between50 and 100 kb, with an average size of 78 kb. Despite all this evidence, there are several reports where introducing di erent arrays of alphoid DNA does indeed lead to centromere formation. Several studies have shown howwhen large ( >50 kb) arrays of alphoid DNA are transfected into a human cell line (HT1080) in culture, de novo chromo- somes may form with a functional centromere [ 35,46,47]. Nevertheless, much work is still needed in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying de novo centromere formation. 2.2. MAC Formation. There are two di erent strategies to form \"de novo\" HACs. The \"bottom-up\" approach consistsof assembling the elements needed for HAC formationin a vector and with this aim, a universal system to introduce alphoid DNA into any BAC [ 48] using in vivo recombineering has been design, containing a 70 kb arrayof this alphoid DNA proven to be capable of forming de novo MACs [ 38,46]. With the second strategy or \"top-down\" approach an existing chromosome is manipulated in order to reduce its size, eliminating unneeded elements except for the centromere region [ 49]. In the rst studies carried out on the formation of centromeres and de novo human articial chromosomes (HACs) [ 35], synthetic alpha satellite arrays fected telomeric DNA and other genomic sequencesto obtain linear minichromosomes of 6 to 10 Mb in size.Due to the already mention sequence divergence betweenalphoid DNA, arrays from 2 di erent chromosomes were used to obtain 4 minichromosomes-containing cell lines, twowith alphoid DNA from the Y chromosome and the othertwo with alphoid DNA from chromosome 17. However,three of these minichromosomes had acquired DNA fromother centromeres or neo-centromeres, and only one of themcontained alphoid DNA exclusively from the transfected - DNA. The HACs were cytogenetically stable, in terms of thepresence and absence of selection, and their copy number orsize did not change over time. Only one year later, YAC-based mammalian articial chromosomes (MACs) were generated [ 47], yeast articial chromosomes having been widely used to introduce mam-malian genes into mice as they can harbour large DNAfragments [ 15,50,51]. In these studies, a recombination decient yeast host was used in which alphoid arrays 21 ( 21-I and21-II), transfected into HT1080 cells. The results obtainedshowed some regarding the proportion cell linescontaining minichromosomes (from 18% to 68%), althoughthe number of MACs per cell line was most frequentlyone. The MACs obtained segregated accurately, they boundcentromeric proteins, and they were about 1-5 Mb in size.In addition, they did not gain host DNA and presented aloss rate of less than 1% per generation in the absence ofselection. A further advance came when it was demonstrated that no telomere sequences are needed when the input DNA iscircular [ 46]. Accordingly, it was established that MACs can be formed in HT1080 cells from either linear or circularinput DNA, with circular alphoid constructs being veryeective at forming MACs, whether or not human telomere sequences are added. Indeed, the presence of these arrays didnot favour MAC formation. By contrast, it was ascertainedhow linear DNA molecules require telomere sequences tomaintain and protect minichromosome ends. When considering the de novo formation of HACs, an important inconvenience is the fact that these structuresare not stable in murine cell lines [ 52], making it di cult to perform studies in mice as a model system. When a previously established HAC was transferred into severalmurine cell lines (RAG, STO and LA-9), the HAC DNArearranged and was di erent to the original HAC. However, murine DNA was not acquired and no integration events4 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology were observed. When selection was withdrawn, the articial chromosomes were rapidly lost at a rate between 2%-5%per day, depending on the cell line. These results show howcentromere activity is retained to some extent, as they werestill able to bind a marker of active centromere, yet as pointedout above, they also suggested that something else is needed to provide correct segregation. 2.3. Gene Expression from Articial Chromosomes. The next advance in the development of human articial chro-mosomes was probably the demonstration that any genecloned into those constructs could be expressed normally,as addressed in several reports. There are two studies wherethe entire human HPRT gene was expressed from such mammalian articial chromosomes (MACs) [ 53,54], using slightly di erent strategies but with the same results. A PAC containing about 140 kb of genomic DNA, including thehuman HPRT gene, and a second PAC including a 70 kb array of-DNA derived from chromosome 21 ( 21-I) [ 46] were transfected into HPRT-decient HT1080 cells [ 53]. The results obtained showed how two of the three MAC-containing cell lines generated were mitotically stable andthat HPRT expression was maintained over long periodsof time, even in the absence of selection. In a secondstudy, a 404 kb HAC made by in vivo recombination and introduced into HPRT -decient HT1080 cells successfully ensured expression of the gene after two months without any selection [ 55]. More recently, a 21-derived minichromosome made in DT-40 chicken cells using the top-down approach [ 56] was introduced into human HT1080 cells by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer to check its stability [ 57]. Subsequently, the erythropoietin gene was added by cre-loxPrecombination and transgene expression and vector stabilitywas nally tested in HFL-1 cells. Accordingly, the vectorwas mainly maintained as a single copy per cell with notranslocation and/or insertion events, and epoexpression was sustained over 12 weeks without any loss in the absence ofselection. Using the same strategy, the dystrophin gene (about 2.4 Mb in length) has been cloned into a HAC [ 58], a construction that enabled all the tissue-specic isoformsof human dystrophin gene to be detected, overcoming theproblem shared by other vector systems that only produceone of the isoforms. One year later, the same group used thedystrophin HAC to correct patient-derived broblasts andthen transform the corrected cells into human iPS (inducedpluripotent stem) cells [ 59]. This is a great achievement as probably autologous-corrected cells would be the bestcandidate cells to be used in gene therapy protocols. 2.4. Conclusions. It seems that the size and/or structure of the HAC matters since articial chromosomes have a higher rateof missegregation than normal chromosomes [ 60,61]. It is also notable that di erent HACs behave in a di erent way in dierent cell lines [ 62], suggesting that centromere activity could probably be maintained by trans-acting factors withdierent specicities between di erent cell lines, even within the same species.A better understanding of centromere function seems crucial in order to be able to generate \"synthetic\" cen-tromeres, which should improve the development of MACs.Thus, despite some of the advances and successes, theengineering of HACs/MACs to carry genes of interest isevidently quite di cult, which has restricted their use as vectors for gene therapy. 3. Stable Replicating Episomes In view of the di culties associated with MACs, other alternative vectors have been developed to carry largegenomic constructs. Among them, stable non-integratingand replicating episomes have emerged as very promisinggene therapy vectors for dividing cells. Interestingly, thesestable episomes do not become integrated within host cellchromosomes and are therefore not associated with any riskof insertional mutagenesis. 3.1. OriP/EBNA-1 characterized articial minichromosome-like epi-somes of this type are the so called OriP/EBNA1 vectors . These vectors are bacterial plasmids or bacterial articialchromosomes in which episomal replication and segregationare achieved through DNA sequences derived from theEpstein-Barr virus (EBV). This herpes virus has a genomeconsisting of dsDNA of approximately 172 kb and it ischaracterized by a latent phase during which it is maintainedfor life asymptomatically in lymphocytes of about 90% ofthe human population. In the latent stage, the viral genomeis maintained as a circular extrachromosomal replicatingepisome within the nucleus of infected cells [ 63]. The only viral elements needed to confer replication and segregation on this episome are the latent origin ofreplication, oriP, and the viral gene encoding the EBNA1 protein [ 64-66]. The origin of plasmid replication ( oriP) from Epstein-Barr virus is a cis-acting element which has been proven to confer replication autonomy and mainte-nance to recombinant plasmids in cells harbouring latentEBV . OriP is formed by two elements about 1 kb apart: the family of repeats (FR), a 20 member family of 30 bp directrepeats, and the dyad symmetry (DS) element, a 65 bp DScontaining four copies of the repeat [ 67,68].OriP resides within a 1.8 kb segment in the short unique region of the EBVgenome, and it appears to be the only element needed in cis [65,68]. The trans -acting gene allowing oriP function lies in a 2.6 kb region encoding the Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen1( E B N A - 1 )[ 66]. The EBNA-1 protein can bind to both the FR and DS sequences [ 69], whereby the DS element is the initiation site of episomal DNA replication whereas FR actsas a replication fork barrier and termination site [ 70]. EBNA- 1 also activates the 30 bp repeats of oriPi n trans , the latter acting as a transcriptional enhancer for genes linked to therepeat [ 71]. Plasmids containing these two elements ( oriPa n dE B N A - 1) are replicated once per cell cycle and they segregatepassively by attachment to the mitotic chromosomes [ 72, 73]. Such plasmids are maintained in human cell linesJournal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 5 in tissue culture [ 63,66], as well as in mouse cell lines if the plasmid contains large fragments of genomic DNAthat permit replication [ 74]. Although standard EBV-derived vectors usually carry both oriP and EBNA-1, it is well established that vectors containing only the oriPF Ra n d EBNA-1 as well as inserts of genomic DNA greater than 100 kb can be replicated and maintained as episomes, and c a nt h u sb eu s e df o rs t u d i e si nh u m a na n dr o d e n tc e l l s[63]. As the segregation of episomes is passive, by binding to endogeneous chromosomes instead of by direct attachmentto the microtubules of the mitotic spindle, selection issometimes required to maintain a population of cells thatcarry the episomes (especially in cases of a low copy numberof episomes per cell). The typical structure of OriP/EBNA1vectors and their localization in the interphase and mitoticcells is shown in Figure 1. The replication and segregation of OriP/EBNA1 vectors depends only on the presence of EBNA-1 protein. Asmentioned above, the binding of EBNA-1 to the DS elementof OriP destabilizes nucleosomes and aids the recruitment to OriP . The segregation functionof EBNA-1 depends on its ability to bind to both the FRelement of OriP and to the periphery of chromosomes.It is thought that EBNA-1 interacts with chromosomes intwo di erent ways. During interphase (and probably also in mitosis), EBNA-1 associates with chromatin through itsbinding to either cellular DNA or chromatin-associatedproteins. During metaphase/anaphase, there is additionalbinding of EBNA-1 to a cellular protein referred to asEBP2 (EBNA1-binding protein 2), which strengthens the association of EBNA-1 with mitotic chromosomes [ 75]. 3.2. Applications. Ori P/EBNA-1-based vectors have been widely used for a variety of purposes. One of the strategies forcloning a eukaryotic gene relies on the ability to select for thefunctional expression of the gene of interest in mammaliancells [ 76]. A subcloning vector has been designed containing oriP/EBNA-1 that enables the expression of very rare clones to be selected directly [ 77]. These clones were stably main- tained as episomes, 2 to 10 copies per cell, as long as selectionwas applied. Other studies using oriP/EBNA-1 vectors have expressed cDNA from heterologous promoters, all producing highlevels of expression for several weeks or months, and allshowing stable retention of the episomes in the cells forlong periods of time [ 78-81]. Such vectors have even been used to produce large amounts of recombinant proteins [82]. There are also several studies showing how these two elements are su cient for large plasmids to be maintained indenitely in cells, expressing the gene they contain ina physiological fashion. For example, 2 YACs of 90 and660 kb were created that contained oriP and when they were introduced into human cells expressing EBNA-1, theseconstructs were maintained as stable episomes for morethan 8 months in the presence of selection, and for upto 5.5 months without selection [ 83]. Three cell lines were produced with the 90 kb YAC, all of which containedunrearranged episomes. However, of the 3 cell lines con-taining the 660 kb YAC only two presented the intact form of the 660 kb molecule. FISH analysis also demonstratedhow episomes, some visible as pairs, associated with thehost cell chromosomes. This association may explain howthey are so e ciently maintained, even in the absence of selection, indicating that stability is achieved by attachment to host chromosomes as proposed for the EBV genome [84]. An intact CFTR gene has also been expressed from anoriP/EBNA1 episome in mouse cells [ 85]. By introducing circularized YACs were obtained andmaintained as episomes of either 320 or 640 kb. The copynumber varied between 2 to 56 in the di erent cell lines obtained and the rate of loss varied from 0.4% to 5% in theabsence of selection, very similar to the data from the 293-celllines expressing oriP-YACs [ 83]. The level of expression of the exogenous CFTR gene was dependent on its copy number and each copy of the YAC produced about 20% of the levelof each endogenous gene. A further advance was made bychanging the constructs based on YACs to others based onBACs, as the latter are easier to use and manipulate, allowingpurication of much larger quantities of DNA. In order to modify BACs for their use in gene therapy protocols, an e cient system for retrotting BACs with oriP/EBNA1 and reporter genes has been described using loxP/Cre recombination [ 86,87]. These vectors not only contain the elements needed for episomal maintenance,they also include suitable marker genes for selection andmonitoring of the mammalian cells into which the constructsare introduced. 4. Delivery Methods As mentioned above, the type of DNA molecules used forgene therapy is crucial but the \"DNA delivery vehicles\"are also very important. Indeed, the transfer of large DNAmolecules to mammalian cells is not an easy task. Mediumsize BACs can be delivered into mammalian cells usingLipofectamine 2000, and more than half of the transfectedcells contain intact delivered BAC [ 87,88]. However, when working with BACs, the purication of supercoiled DNA may be quite cumbersome and it becomes increasinglydicult with larger BACs. Di erent methods involving less manipulation and/or higher e ciency of delivery should be tested in order to optimize the whole system. T o date,two methods appear to be quite promising to transferBACs-based vectors to mammalian cells: bactofection andpackaging 1 (HSV-1) particles. 4.1. Bactofection. Bactofection refers to the use of bacteria for the delivery of DNA molecules to mammalian cells. Oneadvantage of this method is that it minimizes the need tomanipulate the DNA molecules, which is especially usefulin the case of very large molecules such as BACs. Indeed,die r e n ts t u d i e sh a v ep r o v e nh o wD N At r a n s f e rc a no c c u r from bacteria to mammalian cells [ 89-91]. Hence, bacterial strains that are naturally or articially engineered to beinvasive, but that are attenuated to prevent pathogenesis, are6 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology OriPCMVfrda EBNA-1 ampColE1OriP-EBNA-1 vector (a) (b) (c) Figure 1: (a) Structure of oriP/EBNA-1 vectors.

(c) oriP/EBNA-1 episomes attach to the periphery of chromosomes through EBNA-1 protein and segregate during mitosis. particularly useful for bactofection. Accordingly, attenuated intracellular bacteria engineered to lyse after cell invasionhave been shown to transfer functional genes to a verybroad range of mammalian cells [ 92,93]. The main bacterial species used as delivery vectors are facultative intracellularpathogens such as Salmonella sp [ 94],Shigella sp [ 95], Listeria sp [96], or Y ersinia sp [97]. However, more recently, it was demonstrated that almost any species can be usedprovided they are appropriately engineered [ 98]. Anaerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria are also being applied asanticancer agents to target solid tumours taking advantageof their ability to grow in the hypoxic region of tumours[96,98-103]. Indeed, bacterial delivery has been assessed as a way to administer DNA vaccines using di erent intracellular pathogen strains [ 104,105]. For certain purposes, deter- mined bacterial toxins have been used as vectors to deliverDNA into mammalian cells [ 106]. Ad i erent approach for bacterial delivery relies on the use of a genetically modied E. coli strains that express two additional on the surface of mam- malian cells and hly,the escape from lysosomes once in the cytosol of the mammalian cells. E. coli is also auxotrophic for aminopimelic acid (DAP ), which means that it is not able to form a new cellular membrane once in the mammaliancytosol. For this reason it lyses and freely liberates theDNA it contains. The Y. pseudotuberculosis invasin protein (inv) is encoded by a 3.8 kb gene expressing a 103 kDaprotein localized to the outer membrane, part of a familyof adhesins encoded by enteropathogenic bacteria [ 109]. All the members of this family have a region of similarity in theamino terminal 500 amino acids of the Y. pseudotuberculosis invasin (36% identity). This conserved domain is requiredfor protein localization in the outer membrane and forexport of the carboxyl termini of these proteins. Indeed,the terminal 192 amino acids of invasins represents themost divergent region and it is that which binds to integrinreceptors [ 110,111]. Invasin is the only protein needed to invade mammalian cells and it can be cloned into non-invasive strains of bacteria making them invasive [ 89,112].The second gene introduced in the modied E. coli strain is thehlylocus from L. monocytogenes, encoding listeriolysin O. This protein is a member of the cytolysin family that are pro-duced by various Gram positive species [ 113]. This 58 kDa cholesterol-dependent pore-forming toxin [ 114] allows the bacteria to escape from phagolysosomes into the cytosolof the infected cell [ 115]. In order to promote lysis of the internalized bacteria, the strain used is unable to synthesisea new cell wall when it divides since it is a diaminopimelicacid ( dap) auxotrophic strain, a substrate not present in the mammalian cells. This ensures that the bacteria willnot survive in the cells, and that the plasmid DNA will beliberated into the cytosol and eventually reach the nucleus. Using this bacterial vehicle, functional DNA can be transferred into a variety of mammalian cell lines bysimple coincubation with the engineered E. coli strain [ 107]. Dierent studies have showed that this strain is also able to transfer large DNA fragments [ 116-118], establishing the proof-of-principle for the use of this kind of delivery methodas a true alternative to e ciently deliver intact BACs into recipient mammalian cells. Currently, the use of bactofection seems to be limited toex vivo gene transfer to cultured mammalian cells, although some examples of in vivo applications to cells of the gastrointestinal tract are envisaged. However, thereare very serious concerns about the biosafety of bacteriaas gene delivery vehicles due to the risks of important adverse immunological and inflammatory reactions, which will probably restrict their wider application in gene therapy. 4.2. Packaging into HSV-1 Virions. Vectors based on Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) represent one of the most promising alternatives for the delivery of large DNA molecules, includ-ing many articial minichromosome-like episomes. HSV-1has a genome of 152 kb, so viral vectors based on HSV-1have a notably larger capacity to accommodate DNA thanother conventional viral vectors used for gene therapy, such as retroviruses and adenoviruses [ 119]. HSV-1 derived amplicon vectors are (or bearing two sequences of viral origin: an OriS to permitJournal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 7 replication in packaging cells; and a pacsequence to permit packaging into HSV-1 viral particles. Hence, the remaininggenomic capacity is available for exogenous DNA (up toapproximately 150 kb), which may include entire genomicloci with all their regulatory elements to ensure persistent and physiologically regulated levels of expression [ 120-123]. This feature is probably the most promising characteristic of this type of vector as, to date, they are the only viralvectors with such a characteristic high e ciency of gene transduction that are capable of carrying such large DNAfragments that they may include a whole genomic locus . Other relevant aspects of HSV-1 amplicons as deliveryvehicles include their capability to transduce both dividingand non-dividing cells, and their ability to persist as non-integrating episomes, eliminating the risk of insertionalmutagenesis. As amplicon vectors only contain the oriS and the pac packaging signal as viral DNA sequences, generating themrequires the use of a helper virus encoding all the viral genesnecessary for the assembly and packaging of DNA into viralparticles. This helper virus, although replication-defective,quite often produces amplicons contaminated with helperviruses that can trigger immune and inflammatory responses[124]. Recently, a new system has been developed where all the genes needed for packaging are encoded in a large BAC(which is unable to be packed within virions), eliminating allthe genes unnecessary to generate the amplicon-containingparticles [ 123,125,126]. HSV-1 amplicons can play an important role in gene therapy protocols for neurological disorders due to their notable ability to deliver genes into neurons, both in vitro and in vivo [127-131]. Although they can express foreign genes driven by viral promoters only for a period of severaldays, genes under the control of a neuronal promoter canbe stably expressed [ 132] .I nt h i sc o n t e x t ,i ti sn o ts u r p r i s i n g that expression from a genomic locus where the gene is under the control of its own promoter renders physiological levelsof expression that are maintained stably [ 121]. As neurons are postmitotic cells, there is no need for reinoculation of thetherapeutic gene should a gene therapy protocol use this kindof vector. However, for dividing cells some modicationsw o u l dh a v et ob em a d et ot h ea m p l i c o nv e c t o r si no r d e rfor them to persist during cell divisions. One approach is touse hybrid amplicons containing elements from HSV-1 andelements from the Epstein-Barr virus that confer episomalretention [ 121,122]. Figure 2shows the structure of an HSV-1-derived ampli- con vector encompassing an EBV-based minichromosome-like episome, and the procedure to pack it into HSV-1 virions. Given the high capacity of these vectors, evenarticial minichromosomes may be delivered to mammaliancells with an e ciency higher than that obtained by other methods [ 133]. Thus, HSV-1 HAC amplicons containing alphoid DNA for HPRT mini- gene have e ciently transduced cultured cells, producing stable HPRT expression for over three months. Curiously,not all HACs behave in the same way in the di erent cell lines tested, which was probably due to the level of expression ofsome proteins implicated in cell cycle control [ 133].Whereas HSV-1 virions are unable to pack DNA molecules larger than 160 kb, viral vectors based on otherherpes viruses may have a greater capacity to accommodateexogenous DNA. Thus, cytomegalovirus, which has a 250 kbgenome, may permit larger DNA fragments to be used [ 134]. In this way, herpes virus-based vectors appear to be highly promising \"delivery vehicles\" of articial minichromosome- like episomes for gene therapy applications. 4.3. Gene Therapy of Haemophilia A. Haemophilia A is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder by the Factor VIII gene ( FVIII ) that encodes for a clotting factor [ 135]. It a ects about 1 in 5,000 male births in all populations and it is currently treated by infusion of plasma-derived or recombinant Factor VIII protein. The frequencyof the disorder combined with the high cost of recombinantFactor VIII make it a major burden on the healthcaresystems. Therefore, gene therapy for FVIII deciency isclearly a very attractive option. There are di erent degrees of severity for this disease depending on the levels of thecirculating-factors (severe, less than 1%; moderate, between2%-5%; and mild, between 6%-30%), Thus, low levels of expression may have a large positive e ect on the health of the individual. Interestingly, FVIII is normally expressed inthe liver, an organ that is particularly easy to access for genedelivery. Much work has been carried out towards preparinggene therapies for both FVIII (haemophilia A) and FactorIX (FIX) deciencies (hemophilia B). FIX is a much smallerprotein encoded by a 1385 bp open reading frame that canbe easily packaged as a minigene in retroviral, adenoviraland adeno-associated (AAV) vectors driven by either a viralor a mammalian promoter [ 136-139]. Long-term delivery and physiological expression have been achieved for FIX inmouse models, although many problems remain and genetherapy suitable for human patients is still not available[135]. By contrast, the open reading frame of FVIII is 7055 bp long and it has been much harder to express in viral vectors[140]. Di erent strategies have been applied to make the FVIII cDNA a bit shorter, and hence easier to introduce intodierent vectors, including using a B-domain deleted version of FVIII cDNA [ 141,142] as this domain does not appear to be essential for coagulation [ 14,143-145]. In view of these data, it seems that the election of the vector into which the FVIII gene has to be introduced is not a minor issue for haemophilia A gene therapy. Firstgeneration adenovirus-based vectors still contained viral gene sequences that produced immunogenic reactions and as a consequence, transgene expression was only short-livedas a result of vector clearance [ 146]. Nevertheless, even with these vectors it might be possible to achieve curative levelsof FVIII for several months in haemophilic mice [ 147,148]. However, the results from larger animals were not sopromising [ 149,150] and although some improvements in adenoviral vectors have been made, particularly regardingtransgene expression, some toxicity still persists when thesevectors are used [ 151,152]. There is evidence of the expression of the FVIII cDNA with the B-domain deleted from retroviral vectors in dif-ferent cells lines, from human skin broblasts [ 153,154]t o8 Journal of Biomedicine herpesviral particles. HSV-1BAC and ICP27 plasmid are the elements used for packaging herpesvirus using the helper-free system. bone marrow stromal cells [ 155]. In each case, a functional FVIII factor is expressed but at low levels, due to therepressive sequences found in the cDNA of FVIII gene [156-159]. However, this di culty has been overcome by using slightly di erent retroviral vectors based on the MFG retroviral vector system [ 160]. Y et, in these systems, the therapeutic levels of FVIII in circulation were obtained overjust one week [ 161]. An important drawback of retroviral vectors is their inability to transduce nondividing cells, particularly important if gene therapy is directed to the liver. One way to bypass this limitation has been to useFVIII-expressing retroviral vectors to transduce neonatalmice where hepatocytes are undergoing rapid cell division,thereby obtaining complete correction of the disease [ 162]. Ad i erent approach is to employ lentivirus-based vectors which can transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells[163,164]. Due to the small genome of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, they have been used little with the FVIII gene. Nonetheless, there are reports of therapeutic levels of FVIIIexpression for a limited period of time using this viral system[165,166]. Perhaps due to the disappointing results obtained with other viral vectors, delivery systems based on AAVvectors have recently attracted signicant attention [ 167]. Besides the limitations presented by viral delivery sys- tems, three phase I trials have been launched to test thesafety of the procedure and to check the levels of expressionfrom these vectors. In an ex vivo gene therapy protocol, a B-domain deleted FVIII cDNA expressed from a non-viralplasmid was electroporated into dermal broblasts and, after selection and expansion, the broblasts were reintroducedinto the patients [ 168]. FVIII levels increased in four of the six subjects studied without producing adverse events.In the patient with the highest levels of FVIII expression,the therapeutic e ects lasted for 10 months, although FVIII expression nally disappeared. In a second trial, aB-domain-deleted cDNA was expressed from a moloneymurine leukaemia virus-based (retroviral) vector [ 169], which only produced levels of FVIII expression above 1% sporadically, concluding that e cient retroviral transduction would probably require higher doses and some degree ofmitotic induction. In 2004, a third trial using an adenovirusvector encoding the complete FVIII cDNA was carried out injust a single patient. Despite obtaining sustained expressionof FVIII above 1% of the normal levels for several months,adverse e ects were observed associated with the appearance of thrombocytopenia and an elevation of transaminases[170]. There is only one study where factor VIII has been expressed from a BAC containing the entire genomic locus[118]. As no single FVIII-containing BAC was available, a new one was constructed by homologous recombina-tion [ 171] and then retrotted with di erent elements in order to provide episomal maintenance [ 48,88]. The dierent vectors obtained were introduced into hepatic and nonhepatic human cell lines to check whether theconstruct could drive expression from the transgene, achiev-ing detectable FVIII levels with all of them and in someJournal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 9 cases, even stronger expression than the endogenous gene. Although a demonstration of functional FVIII expres-sion from the BAC awaits the use of cell lines or micewith null endogenous expression, this is the rst char-acterized genomic clone carrying the intact locus which could potentially be useful for therapeutic applications [118]. 4.4. Gene Therapy for Friedreich's Ataxia. Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is the most common form of autosomal recessive ataxiaand it is caused by a decrease in the levels of frataxin, amitochondrial protein encoded by the nuclear FRDA (FXN) gene [ 172]. FA is a predominantly neurodegenerative disease with an estimated prevalence of 1-2 in 50,000 individuals,and it is characterized by the progressive loss of largesensory neurons and spinocerebellar tracts. Other clinicalsymptoms may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy anddiabetes mellitus. The most common cause of the disease is an expansion of the GAA triplet within the rst intron of the FRDA gene, which has a dramatic e ect in reducing mRNA levels and consequently frataxin protein levels [ 173]. Although most patients have both chromosomes a ected by the GAA expansion, it is possible to nd some cases withone expanded allele and a point mutation in the other[174]. Frataxin is an 18 KDa protein [ 175] implicated in functions such as mitochondrial iron homeostasis [ 177], phosphorylation [ 179]. Frataxin is expressed in all cell types, although cells from the nervous system, heart and musclepresent the highest levels of the protein [ 180]. Homozygous frda knockout mice are embryonic lethal a few days after implantation, demonstrating the essentialrole for frataxin during early mammalian embryo devel-opment [ 181]. Thus, it appears that the milder pheno- type associated with the human disease is due to theresidual frataxin expression observed in patients with theexpansion mutations. These results may also explain whyno patients with homozygous point mutations have beenencountered. It has been di cult to generate mouse models for FA because of the embryonic lethality associated with thenull mutations. Neuron-specic and conditional knock-out models generally exhibit a wider and more prominentneurodegenerative phenotype than the human disease [ 182, 183]. Some knock-in mice bearing the human gene with an expansion mutation surprisingly failed to develop any clin-ical phenotype, despite the signicant reduction in frataxinlevels to 25%-36% the wild-type levels [ 184]. More recently, r e p r e s e n t a t i v eF Am o u s em o d e l sh a v eb e e ng e n e r a t e db ycrossbreeding lines of a human FXN YAC transgenic micethat contain unstable GAA repeat expansions with [ 185]. mice express comparatively little frataxin, and they exhibit a neurodegenerative and cardiacpathological phenotype similar to human disease su erers, although signicantly milder. With their limitations, thesemice currently constitute the most useful model to study thephysiopathology of FA and to test for possible therapeutic approaches. There is no e ective cure for FA, although antioxidants may have a mildly positive e ect on some clinical signs [186]. There has been great interest in the possibility of boosting frataxin gene expression as a therapeutic approach and indeed, erythropoietin [ 187] has been shown to increase frataxin protein levels in cultured cells from FA patients. Ina pilot clinical trial, 12 patients were treated with humanrecombinant erythropoietin (rHeEPO) to establish whetherit could produce an increment in frataxin levels [ 188]. After 8 weeks of treatment, only two patients experienced a net increment in frataxin levels in peripheral blood lympho-cytes, patients who also showed a reduction in markers ofoxidative stress. However, it is not yet clear whether or noterythropoietin raises frataxin levels within a ected neurons. Since chromatin condensation around the GAA repeat isthought to be responsible, to some extent, for the low levelsof frataxin mRNA expression in FA, histone deacetylase(HDAC) inhibitors have also been investigated with the sameencouraging results [ 189,190]. FA is a good candidate for treatment with gene therapy as it is a monogenic disease and an increases in frataxinlevel could substantially improved the symptoms given thathealthy carriers may have around 40%-50% of normalfrataxin levels [ 191]. A human frataxin cDNA has been delivered into FA patient broblasts using lentiviral or adeno-associated viral(AAV) vectors, which has resulted in a partial correctionof their sensitivity to oxidant stress [ 192]. However, the nonphysiological overexpression of frataxin driven by these vectors has been shown to be cytopathological. Interestingly, the expression of frataxin cDNA to \"phys- iological\" driven by canrescue the neurodegeneration triggered by frataxin deciencyboth in cultured neurons and in vivo [193]. These results constitute the rst \"proof of principle\" that neurologicalfunction can be recovered through a gene therapy approachaimed at correcting frataxin deciency. As mentioned above, it seems that optimal frataxin levels are required for correct cell function, since bothdeciency and massive overexpression are associated withcell pathology. Thus, physiologically regulated expression offrataxin gene seems to be important for the gene therapyto succeed in FA. An interesting possibility is the use ofthe entire genomic locus of frataxin, since its large size may ensure the inclusion of all the regulatory elements requiredfor proper gene expression. Previous reports of transgenic mice indeed support the use of the frataxin genomic locus to correct frataxin deciency in vivo . the entire FXN gene within a human YAC clone of 370 kb was reported to rescue the embryoniclethality of frataxin knock-out mice [ 19]. Likewise, a human BAC clone of 188 kb containing the entire genomic FXN locus has also been demonstrated to rescue the lethal phenotype of frataxin deciency [ 16]. This indicates that theFRDA -BAC contains all the regulatory elements needed for the FRDA gene to be expressed in a physiological fashion.10 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology A slightly smaller FRDA -BAC of 135 kb containing the entire 80 kb FXN genomic locus has been used to generate an HSV-1 amplicon (iBAC- FRDA ) in order to test its ability to correct the FA phenotype [ 194]. This vector is capable of restoring physiological levels of frataxin in broblasts fromFA patients and hence, of almost completely rescuing the cell phenotype of susceptibility to oxidative stress. Another key issue when using this kind of vector is the ability toinfect cells that are hard to transfect with other techniques[195]. Once FRDA expression from the iBAC has been demonstrated, the iBAC might be used for in vivo delivery of theFRDA gene to FA-a ected regions since delivery of HSV- 1 amplicons to determined brain regions has already beenshown [ 127]. Indeed, we have results indicating that HSV- 1 amplicons containing the entire frataxin genomic locus produce persistent gene expression in the nervous systemin vivo (Corona et al., manuscript in preparation). All these results support the promise of these vectors for gene therapyof FA. In this regard, it is particularly interesting that herpes viral vectors are now in clinical trials for gene therapy of chronic pain. The results of this trial will provide the rst clues about the safety and e cacy of herpes viral vectors as \"gene-delivery vehicles\" in the human nervous system[196]. 5. Conclusions Articial chromosomes and minichromosome-like episomes based on BACs containing entire genomic loci are very promising tools for gene therapy of inherited diseases causedby recessive mutations, such as haemophilia or Friedreich's ataxia. The development of vehicles capable of accommodate whole genes emerges like a priority due to the importance ofcorrect and accurate expression of most genes. Even if thisis the key question, we should not forget that the way thesemolecules are delivered into target cells is as important asthe former. So, improved development of delivery methodsshould be as well crucial for the success of gene therapyusing these large DNA molecules. In this respect, ampliconvectors based on herpes viruses are currently a very usefultool regarding average BACs but still much work is neededin order to increase their DNA capacity or nding alternativemethods for delivery.
