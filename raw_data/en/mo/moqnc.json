Dias, MD, Veetai Li, MD; and Michele L. Shaffer, PhD /H14067 ABSTRACT. Objective. Abusive head injuries among infants (shaken infant or shaken impact syndrome) rep- resent a devastating form of child abuse; an effectiveprevention program that reduces the incidence of abu-sive head injuries could save both lives and the costs of caring for victims. We wished to determine whether acomprehensive, regional, hospital-based, parent educa-tion program, administered at the time of the child'sbirth, could be successfully implemented and to examineits impact on the incidence of abusive head injuriesamong infants <36 months of age. Methods. All hospitals that provide maternity care in an 8-county region of western New York State partici-pated in a comprehensive regional program of parenteducation about violent infant shaking. The program was administered to parents of all newborn infants before the infant's discharge from the hospital. The hospitals wereasked to provide both parents (mothers and, wheneverpossible, fathers or father figures) with information de-scribing the dangers of violent infant shaking and pro-viding alternative responses to persistent infant cryingand to have both parents sign voluntarily a commitmentstatement (CS) affirming their receipt and understandingof the materials. Program compliance was assessed bydocumenting the number of CSs signed by parents andreturned by participating hospitals. Follow-up telephoneinterviews were conducted with a randomized 10% sub-set of parents, 7 months after the child's birth, to assessparents' recall of the information. Finally, the regional incidence of abusive head injuries among infants and children <36 months of age during the program (study group) was contrasted with the incidence during the 6preceding years (historical control group) and with state-wide incidence rates for the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-vania during the control and study periods, using Pois-son regression analyses with a type I error rate of 0.05. Results. During the first 5.5 years of the program, 65 205 CSs were documented, representing 69% of the94 409 live births in the region during that time; 96% ofCSs were signed by mothers and 76% by fathers/fatherfigures. Follow-up telephone surveys 7 months later sug-gested that >95% of parents remembered having re-ceived the information. The incidence of abusive head injuries decreased by 47%, from 41.5 cases per 100 000live births during the 6-year control period to 22.2 casesper 100 000 live births during the 5.5-year study period.No comparable decrease was seen in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during the years 1996-2002, whichbracketed the control and study periods in western NewYork State. Conclusions. A coordinated, hospital-based, parent education program, targeting parents of all newborn in-fants, can reduce significantly the incidence of abusivehead injuries among infants and children syndrome, nonaccidental head in-jury, abusive head trauma, child abuse, head trauma, injury prevention.

Caffey1,2first used the term whiplash-shaken infant syndrome to describe the association of intracranial injuries, retinal hemorrhage, and certain long bone fractures attributable to child abuse among infants (the majority /H110211 year of age). Other terms for this condition include shaken baby syn-drome or shaken infant syndrome, shaken impactsyndrome, 3infant shaken impact syndrome,4infant whiplash-shake injury syndrome,5abusive head trauma,6and inflicted, nonaccidental, or intentional head injury. Shaken infant syndrome is the most widely used and recognized term, although shaking alone may not account for all injuries.3Whatever the terminology and pathogenesis, abusive head injuries among infants represent one of the most severe forms of child abuse, with 13 to 30% mortalityrates 4,5,7,8and significant neurologic impairments in at least one half of the survivors.9 The economic costs of abusive head injuries are significant; initial inpatient hospitalization costs av-erage $18 000 to $70 000 per child, and average on-going medical costs can exceed $300 000 perchild. 10-12Many children require long-term medical services, physical, occupational, speech, and educa- tional therapies, and lifelong custodial care. Long- term management costs exceeded $1 million in 1case. 11Additional costs associated with loss of soci - etal productivity and occupational revenue and with prosecution and incarceration of a perpetrator areFrom the Departments of *Neurosurgery and /H14067Health Evaluation Sciences, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Milton S.

An effective prevention campaign could potentially save the lives of many children and im-prove the lives of many others; the costs of such acampaign could be recovered from the economicsavings to society. Despite the severity of the injuries and enormous societal costs, previous studies suggested that 25 to 50% of people have not received information aboutthis problem. 13-16In some cases of abuse, the perpe - trators admitted to shaking the infant violently but confessed that they were unaware of the dangers of doing so.17However, the American Academy of Pe - diatrics suggested that \"the act of shaking leading to shaken baby syndrome is so violent that individuals observing it would recognize it as dangerous andlikely to kill the child.\" 18Moreover, recent news coverage of individual cases and scattered publicawareness campaigns in the past 2 decades mighthave increased significantly public awareness aboutthis problem. Therefore, the role of prevention might be not to educate the general public but to remind the right people at the right time. Parents and their partners are responsible for nearly three fourths of cases, with fathers or stepfa-thers (37% of cases) and boyfriends (21% of cases)accounting for the majority of cases and mothersaccounting for an additional 13%. 6The average age of the victims is 5 to 9 months, and almost all are /H1102136 months of age.3,9The temporal proximity to the child's birth, the relatively short period during which infants and children are at risk, and the preponder-ance of parent perpetrators afford unique opportu-nities to intervene through a program of hospital- based parent education administered at the time of the infant's birth and to study the impact of such aprogram on the frequency of these injuries. In December 1998, a comprehensive, hospital- based, parent education campaign began in an8-county region of western New York State (WNY)served by the Women and Children's Hospital ofBuffalo (WCHOB). The goals of the program were (1)to provide a universal consistent education programto parents of all newborn infants in the region, (2) toassess parents' knowledge about the dangers of vio- lent infant shaking, (3) to track the dissemination ofinformation through the return of commitment state-ments (CSs) signed by 1 or both parents, and (4) toassess the impact of the program on the regionalincidence of abusive head injuries among infants andchildren /H1102136 months of age. The 8-county region of WNY is well suited to studies of the effectiveness ofa prevention campaign because (1) the region is sur-rounded on 3 sides by state or international bordersand therefore is geographically isolated, (2) a reviewof regional insurance databases and the StatewidePlanning and Resource Cooperative Systems data-base of hospital discharge diagnoses confirmed thatessentially all infants with head trauma in this regionare referred to a single center, the WCHOB, and (3)the minimal historical incidence of abusive infanthead injuries during the preceding 6-year period(December 1992 through November 1998, inclusive)could be calculated from WCHOB admission dataand Erie County Medical Examiner's Office recordsand compared with data collected prospectively dur-ing the subsequent study period. METHODS In December 1998, a hospital-based, parent education program, provided at the time of the infant's birth, was administered through nurses at all 16 hospitals that provide maternity servicesin the 8 counties of WNY. In October 1998, the principal investi-gator (M.S.D.) provided a 1-hour training session for nurse man-agers from these hospitals during an annual, regional, perinataloutreach conference, emphasizing the dangers of violent infantshaking, discussing the program methods, and providing a shortset of written instructions to train the nurses on their units. A fewnurse managers who were not in attendance were contacted indi-vidually after the conference. All nurse managers were asked totrain nurses on their units (both maternity wards and intensivecare nurseries) to administer the program to parents. The unitnurses were asked, at a minimum, to disseminate informationabout violent infant shaking to both parents of newborn infantsbefore the infant's discharge from the hospital and to have bothparents sign a CS affirming their receipt and understanding of thematerials. Nurses were encouraged to seek actively fathers orfather figures for education whenever possible, to provide pro-gram information separate from other materials, so as not todetract from the central message, and to answer parents' questionsabout violent infant shaking and shaken infant syndrome. The program and its message were intentionally kept very simple, to maximize hospital compliance. Nurses were asked tohave parents read a 1-page leaflet ( Prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome ; American Academy of Pediatrics) and view an 11-minute video-tape ( Portrait of Promise: Preventing Shaken Baby Syndrome ; Midwest Children's Resource Center, St Paul, MN) that discussed the dan-gers of violent infant shaking (but not striking, slamming, or othermechanisms of abuse) and suggested ways to handle persistentinfant crying. Educational posters ( Never, Never, Never, Never Shake a Infant ; SBS Prevention Plus, Groveport, OH) were displayed on the wards, to provide information for families and visitors. Alleducational materials were available in both English and Spanish. Both parents were also asked to sign voluntarily a CS affirming their receipt and understanding of the materials (Fig 1). In the fewcases in which the parents chose not to sign, the nurse wasinstructed to expunge all individually identifying information andreturn the CS (indicating that the parents had been exposed to theprogram). The CSs were collected by the nurses and returnedmonthly to the study coordinators. The CS asked simple demo-graphic questions about the parents' ages, highest educationallevel, marital status, and type of insurance and the town of theinfant's residence, to ensure that the program reached a broadcross-section of parents. The CS also asked parents whether theinformation was helpful, whether this was the first time they hadheard that shaking an infant was dangerous, and whether theywould recommend this information for all new parents. Parentswere asked to consent to a brief, follow-up, telephone survey 7months after the child's birth and to provide their home telephonenumber. Ten percent of the parents who had consented to thefollow-up survey were selected randomly and were contacted 7months later, to test their recall of the program information. A7-month follow-up period was chosen because it is in the middleof the range of average ages of victims reported in the literature. The regional incidence of abusive head injuries among infants and children /H1102136 months of age was tracked prospectively during the 66-month period of the study (December 1998 through May2004, inclusive) and was contrasted both with the minimal re-gional incidence during the 60 months immediately preceding theprogram (December 1992 through November 1998, inclusive) andwith incidence rates of substantiated abusive head trauma in theCommonwealth of Pennsylvania (determined through judicial rul-ing or by the Office of Children and Family Services and obtainedfrom the Child Line Database, Pennsylvania Department of PublicWelfare) during the years 1996-2002, inclusive, with Poisson re-gression analyses with a type I error rate of 0.05. Because the exactmechanisms of abuse (shaking versus impact) might not be knownwith certainty in individual cases, all infants and children /H1102136 months of age evaluated at WCHOB with either the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision , code for shaken infant syndrome (code 995.55) or an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision , code for intracranial injury, skull fracture, or retinal www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2004-1896 e471 at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from hemorrhage with an external cause of injury code for known or suspected homicide or child abuse (codes E960-E968 and E980-E989) were included. One of the authors (P.M.) served on theregional child fatality team and maintained contact with childprotective services workers, law enforcement officials, and medi-cal examiners to identify additional cases. Local television andnewspaper coverage was reviewed. Finally, abusive head injuryadmissions to Strong Memorial Hospital, the tertiary referral cen-ter in Rochester, New York, for the adjacent 9-county region ofupstate New York, were reviewed, to ensure that cases from theinvolved counties had not been referred out of the region. Eachidentified case of abusive head injury in WNY was cross-refer-enced to the study database, to identify a signed CS. All suspected cases of abusive head injury during the historical and study periods were reviewed in detail by the same multidis-ciplinary medical team, which included a dedicated child abusephysician (P.M.) and 2 pediatric neurosurgeons (M.S.D. and V.L.)working with pediatric ophthalmologists, pediatric radiologists,pediatric orthopedists, and pediatric surgeons (when necessary)and New York State Children, Youth, and Family caseworkers, toconfirm the nature of the inflicted injuries in all identified cases. Acommon definition of abusive injury was used throughout boththe historical and study periods and included intracranial injuriesand/or skull fractures without a history of trauma, a traumahistory that was wholly inconsistent with the identified injuries ordevelopmental age of the child, a pattern of intracranial injuries(such as subdural and retinal hemorrhage with diffuse brain hy-podensities) that fit a pattern of abusive injury without an ade-quate explanation, or intracranial injuries associated with otheridentified abusive injuries (rib or long-bone fractures or abdomi-nal injuries) that fit a pattern of abuse without an adequate expla-nation. Cases involving only extracranial soft-tissue injuries (scalpswelling or facial bruising), without an accompanying intracranialinjury or skull fracture, were not included during either period. The number of cases per year and the number of cases per 100 000 live births for both the historical control and study periodswere compared with a Poisson regression model. 19In addition, in an attempt to avoid the inevitable lag time for infants born duringthe control period but abused during the study period, the 2groups were also analyzed by assigning each infant to the year ofbirth (rather than the year of abuse) and assessing the incidence ofabusive head injuries during the subsequent 36 months. To dothis, a correction factor was calculated for infants born during thesecond half of the third year and during the fourth and fifth years Fig 1. CS that parents were asked to sign voluntarily, affirming their receiptand understanding of the program ma-terials. e472 ABUSIVE HEAD INJURY PREVENTION at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from of the study period (who would not have been monitored for the full 36 months). The correction factor was determined on the basisof the number of live births in WNY during the corrected yearsand the empirical, cumulative, distribution function 20of age at injury for case subjects born during the control and treatmentperiods with a full 36-month follow-up period. This correctionestimated the number of additional cases expected if these chil-dren had been monitored for the full 36 months. The study wasapproved by the WCHOB institutional review board before im-plementation. RESULTS Of the 16 regional hospitals providing maternity care, 13 participated fully during the entire 66-month study period. One hospital, accounting for 3% of theregion's deliveries, and 1 of 2 wards at a secondhospital began participating during the third year. The ward at the second hospital cared for mothers ofinfants in the hospital's intensive care nursery, anunknown number of whom had been transferredfrom other hospitals where they might have receivedprogram materials. Two hospitals, accounting for19% and 2% of the region's deliveries, provided ed-ucational materials throughout the program but be-gan collecting CSs 15 and 24 months into the pro-gram, respectively. All hospitals in the region haveparticipated fully since the beginning of the thirdyear. A total of 65 205 CSs were recorded, representing 69% of the 94 409 live births during the study period. Ninety-seven percent of returned CSs were signedby at least 1 parent. Ninety-six percent of the re-turned CSs were signed by mothers and 76% byfathers. Although there are no specific regional nor-mative values for new parents against which thedemographic features of the study group could becompared statistically, the returned CSs demon-strated a broad demographic representation, interms of parent age, highest educational level, mar-ital status, type of insurance, and town of the child'sresidence. Ninety-three percent of the parents who returned the CS acknowledged having heard previously aboutthe dangers of infant shaking, confirming one of thestudy hypotheses. Ninety-two percent of the parentsthought that the information was helpful; many ofthe rest commented that the reason they did not wasthat they already knew about the dangers of violentinfant shaking. Ninety-five percent of the parentsthought that the information should be provided toall new parents. Approximately 10% of respondentsprovided positive comments about the program. Thefew negative comments were of 2 types, ie, parentsthought that the subject was either emotionally un-settling or redundant and unnecessary. A survey of nurse managers undertaken at the end of each year suggested that nurses at all hospitalsregularly (75-100% of live births) provided bro-chures, displayed posters, spoke with parents, andhad parents sign the CS. Unfortunately, less than twothirds of the hospitals regularly had parents view thevideotape. Follow-up telephone surveys with par-ents confirmed that they remembered the programbut many were not shown the videotape. Whenasked simply what health and safety topics theyremembered receiving information about at the time of their child's birth, 27% of the respondents men-tioned shaken infant syndrome or infant shaking byname. Among the remaining 73% of respondents,94% responded affirmatively when asked specificallywhether they remembered receiving informationabout infant shaking. Among parents who could re-call the program information, 98% remembered the written materials, 92% the CS, 89% conversationswith the nurse, and 60% viewing the posters; incontrast, only 23% remembered seeing the video-tape. Because parents remembered other aspects ofthe program, the assumption is that they were nevershown the videotape. During the 6 years before the program began, 49 cases of substantiated abusive head injury were iden- tified. This represented an average of 8.2 cases peryear (range: 5-11 cases per year) and 41.5 cases per100 000 live births (Fig 2). During the 66 months ofthe study period, 21 cases of substantiated abusivehead injury were identified. This represented an av-erage of 3.8 cases per year (a 53% reduction) and 22.2cases per 100 000 live births (a 47% reduction). This47% reduction in incidence was statistically signifi-cant ( P/H11005.0168). In addition, statewide incidence rates for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania be-tween 1996 and 2002 (which bracketed the historical and control periods in WNY) did not change signif-icantly during this time (Fig 2B). The incidence inWNY relative to the incidence in Pennsylvania was1.40 during the years 1996-1998 (before the programbegan) and 0.67 during the years 1999-2002 (after the Fig 2. Annual incidence of abusive head injuries in the 8-county WNY region before (December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1998, inclusive) and during (December 1, 1999, through May 31,2004, inclusive) the prevention program.

Recalculation of the incidence figures according to year of birth rather than year of injury also yieldedstatistically significant reductions in incidence dur- ing the study period (Fig 3). The incidence during thehistorical control period was 42.3 cases per 100 000live births (2 children born before but injured duringthe historical control period were excluded from thisanalysis because incidence figures for the year pre-ceding the historical control period were not avail-able) and that during the study period was 23.1 casesper 100 000 live births (Fig 3A) with the calculatedempirical, cumulative, distribution function correc-tion (Fig 3B). The reduction in incidence remainedsignificant ( P/H11005.0221). Even after addition of 1 ad- ditional case per year for the latter 3 years of the study period (an overly conservative analysis), sig-nificant reductions persisted ( P/H11005.0461).A subgroup analysis demonstrated that 7 of the 21 case subjects identified during the program were born to parents who had not been exposed to theprogram; 2 were born before the program had begunand 5 were born at hospitals that were not yet par- ticipating at the time of the infant's birth. Of the 14remaining infants, the birth hospital was unknownfor 1 and 3 were born at participating hospitals butwithout a returned CS. The remaining 10 infantswere born at participating hospitals from whichthere was a CS signed by the parents; the perpetratorin each of these 10 cases (the father in 9 and themother in 1) had signed the CS. Excluding the 2individuals born before the program began and the 1individual for whom the birth hospital was un-known, the incidence was 35.3 cases per 100 000 live births for cases with no signed CS (and therefore norecord of participation in the program) and 15.5 casesper 100 000 live births for cases with a signed CS.

DISCUSSION Child abuse prevention efforts are of 3 general types, ie, primary, secondary, and tertiary.21Primary prevention efforts, of which this program is an ex-ample, address a broad segment of the population(such as all new parents). Secondary prevention ef-forts, such as the home visitation (or nurse-family partnership) program developed by Olds et al, 22,23 target a specific subset of the population considered to be at higher risk for child maltreatment. Tertiaryprevention efforts target perpetrators of child mal-treatment and seek primarily to prevent recidivism. Secondary prevention programs such as home vis- itation programs have had the greatest demonstrated success in reducing child maltreatment 22,23but re - quire considerable resources and are impractical for an entire population. Moreover, their effectiveness in specifically preventing abusive infant head injurieshas not been assessed. Primary prevention programs designed to educate the public about the dangers of violent infant shaking have included television andradio public service announcements, billboard ad-vertisements, 24provision of educational materials to health care providers' offices, schools, and/or com- munity agencies,25and hospital-based education programs.17,26No published study has yet assessed the impact of any of these programs on the incidenceof abusive infant head injuries. Because they must reach large numbers, primary prevention programs must be neither expensive nor time-consuming to administer. A simple program containing a powerful message, administered at theappropriate moment and requiring very little effortor time on the part of those who deliver the messageand those who receive it, has the greatest chance ofsuccess. This prevention program meets these crite-ria and can be successfully implemented on a widescale. We chose a hospital-based, primary prevention program targeting parents of newborn infants forseveral reasons. First, parents are the most common perpetrators of abusive infant head injuries. Second,the period of greatest risk is during the months afterthe infant's birth. Third, childbirth is a time of almostuniversal contact between parents and the medicalcommunity. Fourth, educated parents might be ad-vocates in disseminating this information to others.Finally, research on adult learning suggests thatadults learn best when practical and contextuallysignificant information is provided to help themcope with specific life-changing events, such as mar-riage, a new job, or the birth of a child. Moreover, thegreater the life-changing event, the more likelyadults are to seek out information and to learn.Adults are willing to engage in learning before, after,or during such a life-changing event. 27 This program is unique in several respects. First, it is the only attempt to provide universal, consistent, hospital-based, parent education to an entire region;although not yet universal, the program reached theparents of at least 69% of newborn infants in the region during the study period. Second, it is the only program with demonstrated success in reachinglarge numbers of parents, particularly fathers andfather figures. Third, it is the only program to requireactive parent participation in the process through thesigning of the CS, cementing the central theme of theprogram and perhaps creating a \"social contract\"between parents and their community. The signingof the CS may be a very important (perhaps even themost important) component of the program's suc-cess. Although there might be many possible reasonsfor the lower incidence of abusive head injuriesamong those who signed the CS, the degree of pro-tection was significant, which emphasizes the poten-tial importance of this part of the program. Fourth,this is the only program to track program compliancethrough the return of CSs. Most importantly, this isthe only program with demonstrated effectiveness inreducing the incidence of abusive infant head inju-ries. The observed reductions are likely a minimum,because cases were more likely to have been missedduring the control period (when they were identifiedretrospectively) than during the study period (whenthey were identified prospectively). The data also confirmed that 93% of the parents were already aware of the dangers of violent infantshaking, which suggests that parents need only to bereminded at the appropriate time, ie, the child'sbirth, and the message needs to be retained only fora short period to be effective. Viewed in this manner,the program may be likened to a vaccination pro-gram in which parents, once \"inoculated\" with in-formation, are \"immunized\" against violent infantshaking during this critical period. The costs of sucha program can therefore be compared with the costsof immunizations. The direct cost of administeringthis program (including the collection and trackingof CSs) was $177 268 per year, including salaries fornurse coordinators to administer the program and toperform data entry, costs of supplies, travel ex-penses, postage costs, telephone costs, miscellaneousexpenses, and in-kind costs for nurses at participat-ing hospitals (we estimated an average of 15 minutesof the nurse's time per family, which was a generousestimate considering that the nurse need not be present during the 11-minute videotape). The costswere therefore approximately $10 per infant, compa-rable to the costs of many immunizations. Assuminga 47% reduction in incidence, the costs of the pro-gram could be reclaimed if the average costs of car-ing for victims of injury (including initial costs fornew cases and ongoing costs for survivors) exceeded$21 925 per case each year, well within the rangecurrently quoted for medical costs of abusive headinjuries. 10-12These costs would be substantially lower if only \"face time\" between nurses and parents (more realistically estimated at 5 minutes per family)were included and research costs were excluded. There are at least 5 potential criticisms of such a study. First, it is difficult for some to believe that such a simple intervention could be this effective inchanging human behavior. Many have suggestedthat a more comprehensive program, providing www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2004-1896 e475 at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from more materials or incorporating postprogram self- testing to assess parents' understanding of the mate-rials, might be more effective and/or provide addi-tional information. However, our experiencesuggests that the more time-consuming the program, the less likely it is to be implemented by nurses andaccepted by parents. For practical reasons, the pro-gram was designed to require /H110215 minutes of actual contact time between nurses and parents. Second, a short intervention implemented at a time of increased parental stress might be unlikely to berecalled months later during a period of frustrationand rage. However, adult education principles sug-gest that adults are capable of learning well duringperiods of life change. Moreover, the follow-up tele-phone surveys suggested that the majority of parents remembered having received this information for atleast 7 months after the child's birth. Third, although the program was incapable of reaching every male caregiver (such as a mother'ssubsequent boyfriend), the program was very suc-cessful in reaching a significant proportion of fathersand father figures and also emphasized to participat-ing mothers that they should share this informationwith all care providers. Follow-up telephone surveyswith mothers suggested that a significant number ofthem shared this information with the child's fatherif he was not initially present. However, the programmight be less effective in a setting in which fewfathers are available during the perinatal period. Fourth, there was not an inverse \"dose-response\" relationship between the increasing number of CSssigned each year and the incidence of abusive headinjuries. Although it may be difficult or impossible toidentify accurately a dose-response relationship,given the small numbers of annual cases and inher-ent random variability, the sharp increase in theincidence during 2002 is interesting to note. It is evenmore interesting that 5 of the 8 cases identified dur-ing 2002 occurred during the autumn, at a time whenthe national economy was in decline. A slight in-crease was also noted in Pennsylvania during thatyear (Fig 2), and an inordinate number of abusivehead injury cases were reported in Ohio newspapersduring that time. We wonder whether the number ofcases in WNY might have been even higher during2002 without the prevention program. Fifth, this was not a randomized, controlled trial, which raises the possibility that confounding vari-ables had an effect on the outcome. Although it wasinitially considered, a prospective, randomized trialwas impractical. A randomized study would requireenrollment of many more families to ensure ade-quate statistical power, given the relatively low inci-dence of abusive head injuries in the population.Prospectively randomizing certain hospitals to par-ticipate and others not to participate is difficult be-cause of the widely disparate sizes, birth rates, geo-graphic distributions, and demographic features of the hospitals' constituent patient populations. Pro-spectively randomizing families within each hospitalwould generate the problem of cross contamination;families randomized not to receive informationwould likely receive information through conversa-tions with medical staff members or other families, room sharing, or posters on the wards. In addition,families going through the program more than onceduring the study period could potentially be as-signed randomly to different arms of the study with each birth. We thought that a study comparing theincidence during the study period both with histor-ical control rates in the same region during the im-mediately preceding period and with the state inci-dence rates for Pennsylvania during both the controland study periods would minimize the effects ofconfounding variables on the results. It is possible that the dramatic decline in incidence is attributable to other, unidentified, confoundingvariables. For example, the celebrated conviction ofLouise Woodward (the \"Boston nanny\"), which gen- erated international attention during 1997, couldhave affected public perceptions about infant shak-ing. In addition, regional nurse-family partnershipprograms (2 of which began in 1 county of WNY in1996, with a third program beginning in a secondcounty in 2001) could have accounted in part for thedecline, although the results of this study were muchmore widespread. Several features suggested thatthe reductions were specifically related to the parenteducation program. First, neither the team of physi-cians identifying cases of abuse at WCHOB nor thecriteria on which they based the diagnosis of abusivehead injury changed between the control and studyperiods, and all cases during both the control and study periods fit a common definition of abusive head injury. Second, there was no correspondingdecrease in the number of other types of child abusein the region during the study period. Third, a queryof child abuse specialists on the Special InterestGroup on Child Abuse listserve (SIGCA-MD, CornellUniversity) failed to identify a decline of this mag-nitude in other areas of the country. Fourth, prelim-inary results from the 9-county region surroundingRochester, New York, where the program began inJanuary 2000, showed a similar 41% reduction in theincidence of abusive head injuries during the first 3years of the program (M.S.D., K.S., K.D., and M.Silberstein, MD, unpublished data, 2004). Finally andperhaps most importantly, the statewide incidence ofsubstantiated abusive head injuries in the Common-wealth of Pennsylvania did not change significantlyduring the period 1996-2002 (which bracketed theperiod of study in WNY). This study provides the first firm evidence that a comprehensive program of hospital-based, parenteducation at the time of a child's birth can reduceeffectively the incidence of abusive infant head inju-ries. The success of this pilot program in WNY iscurrently being tested on a larger scale in the Com-monwealth of Pennsylvania, where there is now astatewide mandate to provide this program to par-ents of all newborn infants. The program began inMay 2002 in central Pennsylvania and expanded to the eastern and western regions in 2004. The WNYprogram has entered a second phase (as of January2004) in which the hospital-based information is be-ing supplemented with additional information (andanother CS) provided to parents at the time of the e476 ABUSIVE HEAD INJURY PREVENTION at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from infant's first visit with the pediatric care provider. It is hoped that a systematic approach to prevention(with appropriate authentication of results), al-though it will likely not completely eliminate abu-sive head injury, will at least reduce it to a fraction of its present level.
