In order to prevent severe infection, these patients are vaccinated after their stem cell transplantation with childhood immunization vaccines. Timing of this vaccination is important in order to be effective and obtain proper immune response. Postponement of vaccination would lead to better immune response but would also cause longer- lasting risk of infection. This review describes available data on the timing of vaccination and its vaccine responses. Optimal timing of vaccination might require an individualized approach per patient. Abstract: Consensus on timing of post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) vaccination is currently lacking and is therefore assessed in this review. PubMed was searched systematically for articles concerning vaccination post-HSCT and included a basis in predened criteria. To enable comparison, data were extracted and tables were constructed per vaccine, displaying vaccine response as either seroprotection or seroconversion for allogeneic HSCT (alloHSCT) and autologous HSCT (autoHSCT) separately. A total of 33 studies were included with 1914 patients in total: 1654 alloHSCT recipients and 260 autoHSCT recipients. In alloHSCT recipients, influenza vaccine at 7-48 months post-transplant resulted in responses of 10-97%. After 12 months post-transplant, responses were >45%. Pneumococcal vaccination 3-25 months post-transplant resulted in responses of 43-99%, with the response increasing with time. Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b at 6-17 Meningococcal vaccination at 12 months In general, autoHSCT recipients obtained slightly higher responses compared with alloHSCT recipients. Conclusively, responses to childhood immunization vaccines post-HSCT are poor in comparison with healthy individuals. Therefore, evaluation of response might be indicated. Timing of revaccination is essential for optimal response. An individualized approach might be necessary for optimizing vaccine responses.

Introduction Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a promising and often the only curative option for patients with hematological malignancies [ 1]. Post-HSCT, the immune system is temporarily suppressed due to prior conditioning and usage of immunosup- pressive medication, resulting in infection-derived complications being a major cause of transplant-related mortality [ 2]. Furthermore, pre-HSCT established immunity ,13, https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancersCancers 2021 ,13, 6140 2 of 18 vaccine-preventable diseases might be diminished through transplantation. To avoid infec- tions, preventive strategies such as antibiotics, antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis and post-HSCT vaccination are recommended. Vaccination regimens for childhood immuniza- tion are clearly described in international guidelines, yet optimal timing of the vaccination is less clearly described and variable among guidelines [3-7]. Timing appears to play an important role in vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination before proper immune reconstitution may impair vaccine responses. However, as the risk of infection increases with time, postponing revaccination unnecessarily is undesirable [8,9]. Furthermore, recommendations for allogeneic HSCT and autologous HSCT memory and immune recon- stitution differ [ 3]. In daily practice, post-autoHSCT recipients are either not vaccinated or receive vaccination conforming with the post-alloHSCT guidelines. Insight into vac- cine responses to childhood immunization vaccines related to timing of the vaccination is needed. The aim of the present review was to evaluate the current literature on opti- mal timing of vaccination, vaccine schedule and vaccine types post-HSCT in relation to vaccine responses. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Search Strategy A PubMed search was conducted on 24 June 2021 using several terms, including MeSH terms, for the determinants 'HSCT' and 'vaccination' (Supplementary Table S1), com- bined with the Boolean operator 'AND'. The search was limited to studies published after 1 January 2005 . References of articles were crosschecked, and duplications were excluded . 2.2. Selection Criteria Articles on children (age < 18), non-English written articles, reviews, case reports, recommendations (and similar: guidelines, opinions) and non-human studies (in-vitro and animal studies) were excluded. Full-text articles were selected by screening title and abstract for relevancy by the inclusion criteria: (1) study population being post-HSCT patients; (2) vaccinating the population post-HSCT; (3) measuring vaccine responses as correlates of protection post-vaccination. 2.3. Quality Assessment Full-text articles were considered relevant when meeting inclusion criteria. All in- cluded articles were judged on their validity. For randomized controlled trials (RCT), the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool [ 10] was used, and for non-randomized cohort studies, the Robins-I Risk of Bias tool was used [ 11]. Two reviewers performed selection and quality assessment independently. Any disagreements were settled by consensus of the whole study group. 2.4. Data Extraction and Data Synthesis To compare studies on both timing of vaccination and vaccine responses, data were extracted and tables were constructed per vaccine, displaying vaccine response as either seroprotection (meaning an antibody titer above vaccine-specic cutoff value) or sero- conversion (conversion from a vaccine-specic negative antibody titer to a positive titer). Response rates after complete vaccine schedule are shown, unless otherwise indicated. Results on alloHSCT and autoHSCT are reported in separate paragraphs and each vaccine is discussed separately. Results are summarized in a table for both groups separately. Studies on both alloHSCT and autoHSCT recipients are reported in both paragraphs if results were available for separate subgroups of the study population; if only data on the total study population were reported, the study is reported in only one paragraph.Cancers 2021 ,13, 6140 3 of 18 2.5. Post-Hoc Analysis Due to rapidly evolving research on COVID-19 vaccines in HSCT patients and their relevance for these patients at this moment, an analysis of these studies was added after completion of the original study. 3. Results 3.1. Searching, Selection and Quality Assessment The search generated 1081 articles (Figure 1). After exclusion for article characteristics, 417 articles were screened on title and abstract. Of these, 355 were excluded due to irrelevancy (for further detail see Figure 1). The selected 62 articles were assessed full-text, after which 27 were excluded due to irrelevant study design or wrong outcome measure or duplication. Consequently, 35 studies were included in the present comprehensive review, with a total of 2866 patients comprising 1671 alloHSCT recipients and 1195 autoHSCT recipients. A total of 24 articles reported results on alloHSCT, 5 on autoHSCT and 6 on both. Fourteen articles reported on influenza [ 12-25], four on pneumococci [ 26-29], one on tetanus and pertussis [ 30], one on Hib [ 31], one on meningococci [ 32], three on hepatitis B [ 33-35], two on measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) two on varicella zoster virus [ 38,39]. Seven articles reported data on multiple vaccines [ 40-46]. Study characteristics of included studies are shown in Supplementary Table S2. The quality assessment is shown in Supplementary Table S3, and denitions for vaccine responses as used in included studies are displayed in Supplementary Table S4. 3.2.

Flowchart of study selection. n = number of studies; N= number of patients in included studies. 3.2.1. Influenza The influenza vaccination in alloHSCT recipients has been widely studied: three RCT's and eight cohort studies were identied. Response rates varied from 10% to 97%. First, administration of single influenza vaccine is discussed. Several studies reported that the timing of vaccination influenced the subsequent vaccine responses. However, an RCT was conducted comparing early single-dosage vaccination to late double-dosage vaccination, which did not show any differences in response for both timing and dosages [ 20]. Results from observational studies are more conflicting: Avetisyan [ 12] reported no differences in response between early-vaccinated and late-vaccinated patients, whereas others showed improved responses upon extending the delay of the administration of the influenza vaccination [ 13,19]. For example, Issa [ 13] reported improvement of response for every additional year of interval between transplantation and vaccination (OR 1.79 (1.12-2.85)).Cancers 2021 ,13, 6140 6 of 18 This was supported by De Lavallade [ 19], who reported that the patients vaccinated 48 months post-transplant gained seroprotection, whereas those who were vaccinated median 6.5 months post-transplant did not ( p= 0.015). In addition to timing, usage of immunosuppressive medication has an influence on vaccine response: use of rituximab during the year prior to vaccination negatively influenced response [ 13]. Of note, post- HSCT patients were considered to have a delayed vaccine response compared with healthy controls: Mariotti measured 54% response at 28 days post-vaccination versus 71% response at 90 days post-vaccination [15]. Several studies compared different types of influenza vaccines. Natori [ 21] performed an RCT comparing the adjuvant vaccine and non-adjuvant vaccine; they found no differ- ence. An RCT on high dose (HD) influenza vaccine as compared with standard dose (SD) showed no benet of the HD vaccine [22]. Multiple studies administered two influenza vaccines. De Lavallade [ 19] reported im- provement in response from 46% after the rst vaccine to 73% after the second. Dh \u00e9din [ 16] and Mohty [ 18] supported this benet of a second vaccine, but Karras [ 20] and Roll [ 17] did not. These differences might be explained by GVHD rates and timing. GVHD rates in the study by Roll [ 17] were much higher (36.8%) compared with the studies that demonstrated benet of booster vaccination (De Lavallade 0% [ 19]; Mohty 15.4% [ 18]). Additionally, timing of vaccination was earlier in the study by Roll [ 17]: approximately 15 months versus 36 and 30 months, respectively [18,19], which may have influenced booster efcacy. In conclusion, the data suggest that influenza responses in alloHSCT recipients is increased by postponing vaccination and that booster vaccination might be effective, whereas usage of adjuvants or high vaccine dosages does not improve vaccine responses. 3.2.2. Pneumococcal For pneumococcal vaccination in alloHSCT recipients, seven cohort studies and one RCT were included. There was huge variation in the number of vaccine dosages. Timing varied from 3 to 25 months post-transplant and responses varied from 43% to 99%. To assess an optimal timing for vaccination, Cordonnier [ 29] performed an RCT to compare early (arm I: 3 months post-HSCT) to late (arm II: 9 months post-HSCT) vaccination using three conjugate vaccines (Prevenar PCV13 at 0, 1, 2 months) and one polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax PPV23 at 9 months). Responses were slightly better in arm II, which could possibly be explained by a higher rate of active GVHD in arm I (22.7% arm I versus 16.9% arm II). However, increase in response with increasing interval between HSCT and vaccination was supported by Langedijk [ 28].Winkler [ 44], Meerveld-Eggink [ 41] and Shah [ 42] found comparable responses to Cordonnier [ 29] also using three conjugate vaccines (PCV7 or PCV13). Of note, Winkler [ 44] reported an improvement in measured vaccine response with time post-vaccination: measurement at 6 months post-vaccination showed seroconversion rates of 65-91% versus 55-67% at 1 month post-vaccination. Usage of varying number of vaccines was studied. Usage of only one vaccine resulted in lower responses: 43-44.7% [ 26,40]. More recently, Cordonnier [ 27] evaluated immuno- genicity of a fourth dose of PCV13 and concluded that this did not improve response. However, they did report better overall responses compared with their study in 2010. Some differences in study population might have played a role. The GVHD-rate was lower in 2015 (4.3% versus 16.9-22.7% in 2010) and conditioning included less myeloablative regimens (54.9% versus 79.6% in 2010). Overall, best vaccine responses were obtained when three conjugate vaccines were administered. Vaccination initiated at 3 months post-HSCT provided adequate vaccine responses; however, postponing vaccination resulted in higher responses. 3.2.3. Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis (DTP) and Poliomyelitis For diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliomyelitis vaccination in alloHSCT recipients, four studies were included. Tetanus responses were 52-100% starting vaccination at least 6 months post-alloHSCT. Shah [ 42] and Meerveld-Eggink [ 41] reported better responsesCancers 2021 ,13, 6140 7 of 18 with respect to less acute GVHD and a prolonged interval between HSCT and vaccination. However, Conrad [ 43] and Winkler [ 44] showed higher response rates at 6-7.5 months post-transplantation, questioning the influence of interval between HSCT and vaccination. Winkler reported a worse seroconversion rate for polio, which is probably due to their already higher seroprotection rate pre-vaccination of 46% [ 44]. Conclusively, DTP and poliomyelitis vaccines be administered at 6 months post-transplant. 3.2.4. Haemophilus influenzae Type b (Hib) Hib vaccination in alloHSCT recipients was evaluated in ve cohort studies. All studies showed adequate responses of 77-97%. On short-term immunity, no benet was found for administration of a booster vaccine [ 40-44]. Vaccination might be initiated at 6 months post-transplantation. 3.2.5. Meningococcal For meningococcal vaccination in alloHSCT recipients, two studies were identied, us- ing meningococcal ACYW vaccine. Cheng [ 32] reported responses of 54-83% per serotype after one vaccine at 12 months post-HSCT. 3.2.6. Hepatitis B On hepatitis B vaccination in alloHSCT recipients, four studies were included. Onozawa [ 33] started vaccination at 12 months post-transplantation, and Takahata [ 34] started vaccination after cessation of immunosuppressive therapy\u2014on average 15 months post alloHSCT. Both studies found comparable response rates around 40% after three vaccines. Jaffe [ 35] started their vaccination later\u2014namely, 23 months post-transplant\u2014and achieved better responses using the same vaccination schedule. Conrad [ 43] started earlier, at 6 months post-transplant and found a response rate of 84%. However, 56% of their population was already seroprotected before vaccination, which makes comparison more difcult. Of note, Jaffe [35] concluded that GVHD was associated with a signicantly poorer response. Conclusively, hepatitis B vaccination achieved poorer responses compared with all other vaccinations and should not be administered before 12 months, as responses seem to improve with time post-transplantation. 3.2.7. Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) For MMR vaccination responses, two studies were included. Aoki [ 36] administered two doses of vaccine at median 69.3 months post-HSCT. All patients were seronegative be- fore vaccination and seroconversion was found in only 19-30%. Evaluating their responses, chronic GVHD was negatively associated with seroconversion (OR 0.06; p= 0.023). This influence of GHVD is supported by Kawamura [ 37]. However, though vaccinating with only one dose and earlier post-transplantation (median 41.7 months post-HSCT), their seroconversion rates were remarkably better: 36-72%. This might partially be explained by different cutoff values for seroprotection. 3.2.8. Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) For VZV vaccination, one study was included with Shingrix vaccine. This study only studied 17 alloHSCT patients [ 38]. Their response rate was 18%, which they compared with an autologous population ( n= 13; response 62%). The only influencing factor in their multivariable analysis was type of HSCT, thus allogeneic or = 0.08; p= 0.01) . 3.3.

Influenza Data on influenza vaccination post-autoHSCT is scarce. Two studies reported only on autoHSCT recipients, of which one was an RCT by Villa [ 25]. This RCT compared single to double dosage vaccination at 1-year post-HSCT and reported no benet from a second vaccine. Another study reported on autoHSCT and alloHSCT separately: Three autoHSCT recipients were included and vaccinated 2 years post-autoHSCT with response rates of 50-100% [14]. Gueller [ 23] and Engelhard autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients. Respectively, 17.6% and 29.5% of the patients were autoHSCT recipients, with an average timing of vaccination of 20 months post-HSCT. Response rates were fairly low: 33-53% after one vaccine. Gueller reported benet from booster vaccines improving response up to 91% [ 23], whereas Engelhard did not [ 24]. Assessing predictors for inadequate vaccine response, Gueller [ 23] concluded that usage of immunosuppressants caused failure in response: 88.9% of their non-responders used immunosuppressants versus 0% of their responders. When comparing the autoHSCT population with the alloHSCT, some differences were reported. Yal\u00e7in [ 14] reported a better response in their autoHSCT recipients, and this is supported by Gueller [ 23]: they reported 71.9% of their seroconverters to post-alloHSCT, from their non-seroconverters 90% 2021 ,13, 6140 9 of 18 Pneumococcal Only two studies on pneumococcal vaccination in autoHSCT recipients were included, with responses of 58-78% with vaccination started at 6-12 months post-HSCT [ 45,46]. Conclusively, the timing of this vaccination seems to make no difference and might therefore be initiated at 6 months post-autoHSCT. 3.3.3. Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis (DTP) On diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis in autoHSCT patients, three studies were in- cluded. One study administering three dosages of DTP vaccine showed 100% response for tetanus, but all recipients appeared to already have protective antibody titers pre- vaccination [ 45]. The second study, also using three dosages, showed a seroconversion rate for tetanus of 60%, diphtheria 70% and pertussis 76%, with the majority of non-responders already being seroprotected pre-vaccination [ 46]. The nal study vaccinated with a single DTP vaccine and reported low responses (7.1-32.1%). This study concluded that multiple vaccinations are required for adequate response [ 30]. Vaccination might thus be initiated at 6-12 months post-autoHSCT with preferably three vaccines to be administered. 3.3.4. Haemophilus influenzae Type b (Hib) For Hib vaccination in autoHSCT recipients, three studies were included. Both stud- ies by Van der Velden showed high responses for vaccination at 6 months post-HSCT: 94-100% [ 31,45]. Palazzo found a lower seroconversion of 71%, yet 24% of their study population already had protective titers pre-vaccination [46]. 3.3.5. Meningococcal Only one study on meningococcal vaccination in autoHSCT recipients was included. Cheng [ 32] reported comparable seroconversion rates for their alloHSCT and autoHSCT patients and suggested that, despite a response of 69-85% after one vaccine, a booster might be benecial. 3.3.6. Hepatitis B On hepatitis B vaccination in autoHSCT patients, one study was included: VZV vaccination, studies were included with Shingrix vaccine. Both re- ported similar response rates, despite variety in moment of vaccination. Stadtmauer [ 39] included many more patients than Camargo [ 38] (n= 922 versus n= 13) and evaluated responses per age group with non-signicant differences in response (age 18-49 years old, 57.7%; age > 49 years old, 71.4%). Conclusively, vaccination early post-autoHSCT might be feasible. 3.4.

Post-Hoc Analysis: COVID-19 For studies on COVID-19 vaccines in post-HSCT patients, a separate search was conducted on 22 November 2021 using the orig inal search strategy (Supplementary Table S1) with the addition of MeSH term 'COVID-19' or Title/abstract-term 'covid*' or 'corona*' through the Boolean operator 'AND'. This search resulted in 77 results. These results were screened on title and abstract and were excluded based on similar criteria as studies in the original search. Namely, study design (case report n = 1; reviews n = 25; recommendations n = 4); not on HSCT patients ( n = 21); not on vaccination ( n = 9); not on COVID-19 ( n = 3); wrong outcome measure ( n = 4); duplication ( n = 1). Only 1 article was included through snowballing. This resulted in 10 articles be ing suitable for this analysis, which are shown in Table 3 in order of timing of the vaccination post-HSCT [48-57].

This was also seen in the available response rates for COVID vaccination: 37-50% <12 post-HSCT [ 49-56]. One study reported on vaccination < 6 months post-HSCT with only 12.5% response ( n= 8) [ 57]. In addition to timing, usage of immunosuppressants and active GVHD seem to be the most important factors influencing response. Conclusively, responses for COVID-19 vaccines remain poor compared with the healthy population long after HSCT, but responses do improve with time. 4. Discussion This study intended to provide an overview of current knowledge on the optimal timing and schedule of post-HSCT vaccination. A total of 35 studies with varying vaccina- tion schedules were included: 24 on alloHSCT, 5 on autoHSCT and 6 addressing both. In general, results are very heterogenic, and integrated studies are scarce. 4.1. Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Drawing a rm conclusion based on the current literature is impossible due to the heterogeneity of the studies. Nevertheless, a few denitive points can be taken:Cancers 2021 ,13, 6140 12 of 18 1. Many post-HSCT patients respond inadequately to vaccination, and responses are remarkably low compared with the healthy population. Thus, evaluating responses post-vaccination might be indicated. Suggested antibody titers for this evaluation in clinical practice are provided in Supplementary Table S5, including suggested cutoff values. 2. Most studies showed improved vaccine responses when delaying revaccination for at least 6 months post-transplantation and thereby allowing better immunological recovery [ 8,9]. However, postponing vaccination increases risk of infection: the estimated incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is 347 infections per 100,000 alloHSCT recipients compared with only 7 per 100,000 persons in the general population [ 28]. Timing of revaccination is a balance between immune recovery versus infection risk. Insights in individual immune recovery would help to assess the risk of failure. The factors that influence the immune system and the extent of influence are unknown. For specic vaccines, some comments can be made in alloHSCT recipients: 1. Influenza vaccine studies were extremely heterogeneic. Responses seemed to improve with postponement of vaccination. Most studies initiated their vaccination at least 12 months post-transplantation, and therefore, no proper recommendation can be made on earlier vaccination. However, in case of a pandemic such as we experienced with COVID-19, a less adequate response to vaccination, and thus poorer seroprotection, would be preferable over no seroprotection [ 58]. Therefore, one might then consider vaccinating all patients that are at least 3 months post-HSCT and clinically stable. Earlier post-HSCT and vaccinating family members with close contact to the patient might be considered [4]. 2. Pneumococcal vaccines might already be effective at 3-6 months post-transplant [ 27, 29]. Earliest administration was three months post-transplant with response > 68%. However, responses did increase when vaccination was postponed: vaccination at 7-12 months post-transplant resulted in 69-99% responses [28,41,42,44]. 3. Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and Hib were earliest administered at 6 months post-transplant. Responses for tetanus varied widely ( 52-100% [41-44] ); for Hib responses were slightly more 77-97% [40,44] . Vacci- nation on DTP , Hib might be started at 6 months post-transplantation. 4. Hepatitis B vaccine was administered 6-23 months post-HSCT with varying responses: 40-84% [ 33-35,43]. In the general population, responses to hepatitis B vaccine are also quite low compared with other vaccines [ 47,59]. Therefore, it is advised not to initiate vaccination before 12 months post-HSCT. 5. Vaccine responses to MMR remain suboptimal multiple years post-HSCT, and vacci- nation must be considered carefully per individual. As the vaccine is live-attenuated, the clinical condition of the individual patient is very important. Vaccination must be postponed in case of active GVHD and/or usage of immunosuppressants. 6. VZV vaccination has not yet been studied widely, and thus, no proper recommen- dation on timing can be made. However, with the recombinant subunit vaccine (Shingrix\u00ae), potential severe side effects of the live-attenuated VZV vaccine are no longer an issue, and vaccination can be considered earlier post-HSCT. Finally, COVID- 19 vaccine responses are poor compared with the healthy population. However, vaccination should be considered shortly post-HSCT, as any chance for response must be taken in times of a pandemic such as COVID-19. 4.2. Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation For vaccination of autologous HSCT patients, fewer data are available. Although guidelines [ 3-7] recommend vaccination post-autoHSCT, data on vaccinating this popula- tion are scarce. One can postulate that responses post-autoHSCT might be better because of maintenance of pre-transplant-obtained immunity in post-autoHSCT recipients [ 60]. For post-autoHSCT patients, revaccination is not always general practice despite it be-Cancers 2021 ,13, 6140 13 of 18 ing recommended in current guidelines, similar to guidelines for post-alloHSCT patients. Data on vaccination of post-autoHSCT patients are scarce; however, responses seem to be slightly better in this group compared with post-alloHSCT patients. A more tailored approach might therefore be indicated. However, one could question whether that would be cost-effective. An important factor to consider for this more individual approach in autoHSCT patients would be the original indication of the transplantation. Additional immunosup- pressive treatment post-autoHSCT might decrease vaccine responses [ 61]. For example, rituximab maintenance in mantle cell lymphoma likely has a signicant suppressive effect due to continuous B cell depletion. Likewise, lenalidomide maintenance post-autoHSCT for multiple myeloma patients could have an impact on vaccine responses. On the one hand lenalidomide can induce leukopenia, but it is also associated with immune modu- larity properties resulting, for example, in increased incidence of GVHD [ 62]. The current evidence of Palazzo et al. [ 46] does however not suggest a signicant immunosuppres- sive effect of lenalidomide on vaccine response. Any further supporting evidence with respect to live attenuated vaccines in the setting of lenalidomide would be helpful. Of note, some guidelines still suggest avoiding these live vaccines whilst on lenalidomide mainte- nance post-autoHSCT beyond two years. However, interestingly, recommendations for non-autoHSCT patients on similar medication are lacking. Nevertheless, we recommend being cautious with live attenuated vaccines in patients with multiple myeloma because not only medication but also the disease itself as well as aging contribute to the risk of vaccine-related disease. 4.3. Overall Discussion Some general recommendations can be made: 1. Physicians may need to take into account the current state of immunosuppression and associated expectations for immune recovery to determine the precise timing and the estimated success of vaccination post-HSCT. 2. Future studies with standardized denitions, especially on vaccine response (sero- conversion/seroprotection), are necessary to increase generalizability and relevancy of results. 3. More insight in predictors of vaccine response, such as immune reconstitution, GVHD- status and immunosuppressive therapy [ 61], might help to design an optimized and probably more individualized vaccination schedule. For example, rituximab is known to interfere with immune recovery for 6-12 months after cessation [ 63] and was reported to negatively influence vaccine response [ 13]. Therefore, postponing vaccination is necessary in these specic patients. 4. Finally, though evaluating vaccine responses post-vaccination is highly recommended, it is important to note that antibody titers might still increase with time due to possibly delayed immunization in the post-HSCT population [15,44]. The literature search was performed extensively and considered to be as complete as possible. Accuracy was assured by studying each vaccine separately and also by displaying both seroprotection and seroconversion rates to allow optimal comparison among data. To ensure the quality of this study, great effort was made to maintain proper validity and reliability throughout all included studies. However, there were some limitations. First, only antibody titers were evaluated as a measure of vaccine response, which might underestimate vaccine effectiveness: patients might still benet from vaccination despite low antibody responses [ 64]. Furthermore, only the effect of the rst vaccination post- HSCT was evaluated, and no conclusion can therefore be drawn on effectiveness of booster vaccination. Finally, as only childhood immunizations were studied, additional vaccines might be indicated regionally, such as the hepatitis A or yellow fever vaccine.Cancers 2021 ,13, 6140 14 of 18 5. Conclusions and Recommendations In conclusion, vaccine responses to the childhood immunization vaccines in post- HSCT patients are lower as compared with healthy individuals, and therefore, measure- ment of response might be indicated. Furthermore, timing of vaccination is essential to reach optimal responses. Considering the influence of patient factors such as GVHD and usage of immunosuppressive drugs, an individualized approach might be necessary to optimize vaccine responses. However, guidance on how to initiate this individualized approach is currently lacking and further studies are needed. Based on the included studies, general recommendations on timing of the childhood immunization vaccines post-alloHSCT are made and shown in Table 4. Due to overall lower response rates compared with healthy populations [ 47], assessment of response after vaccination is recommended. For autoHSCT recipients, no recommendations could be formed based on our review due to the scarcity of data. Table 4. Recommendations on timing of vaccination in allogeneic HSCT recipients *.
