In recent years, parents have become more disparaging towards childhood vaccination. One group that is critical about the National Immunization Program (NIP) and participates less comprises parents with an anthroposophical worldview. Despite the fact that various studies have identied anthroposophists as critical parents with lower vaccination coverage, no research has been done toexplore the beliefs underlying their childhood vaccination decision-making. We conducted a qualitative study using three focus groups ( n =16) of parents who visit an anthroposophical child welfare center. Our ndings show that participants did not refuse all vaccinations within the Dutch NIP , but mostly refused the Mumps, Measles, and Rubella (MMR) vaccination. Vaccinationdecisions are influenced by participants' lifestyle, perception of health, beliefs about childhood diseases, perceptions about the risks of diseases, perceptions about vaccine e ectiveness and vaccine components, and trust in institutions. Parents indicated that they felt a need for more information. Su cient references should be provided to sources containing more information about childhood vaccination, especially about the e ectiveness of vaccines and vaccine components and the risks, such as possible side eects and benets of vaccination. This may satisfy parents' information needs and enable them to make a su ciently informed choice whether or not to vaccinate their child. 1. Introduction In recent years, parents have become more disparaging towards childhood vaccination [ 1]. Di erent studies show reasons why parents are critical and sometimes refusevaccination for their children. These include anxiety aboutside e ects, the perception that vaccine-preventable diseases are not serious, and a lack of trust in herd immunity [2]. This suggests that parents who refuse vaccination are concerned about long-term health problems as a resultof vaccination [ 3] and have doubts about the safety of vaccines [ 4]. However, these factors vary between di erent groups of parents who may refuse vaccination. One of thegroups who is critical about the National Immunization Program (NIP) and participates less comprises parents withan anthroposophical worldview. Anthroposophy is a spiritual movement that was founded at the beginning of the 20th century by Rudolf Steiner,an Austrian philosopher. In anthroposophic care, health isviewed as a matter of body, soul, and spirit, and a balancebetween these three. There are anthroposophical medicalpractices in 80 countries around the world [ 5] and anthro- posophy has been applied in various social domains such aseducation (Steiner schools), art, architecture, and agriculture(biodynamic farming). Various countries have reportedlower participation of anthroposophical parents in the NIP2 Advances in Preventive Medicine including Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, UK, and The Netherlands [ 6-11]. Due to the lower vaccination coverage and especially the MMR (Mumps Measles Rubella)vaccination, outbreaks of infectious diseases such as measlesstill occur among these populations [ 6,9-11]. In The Netherlands, the anthroposophical community comprises some 4,300 members [ 12]. However, the expected number of people with an anthroposophical worldview ishigher. Dutch parents can choose whether their children(aged 0-4 years) receive their vaccines and health checkups ina standard child welfare center (CWC) or an anthroposoph-ical CWC. Anthroposophical child vaccine providers (CVPs)are more willing to adapt the NIP if asked to by the parents,compared to CVPs at a standard CWC [ 13]. The Dutch NIP is managed by the National Institute of Public Health and theEnvironment (RIVM), is voluntary and free of charge, andhas an overall vaccination coverage of 95% [ 14]. Despite the fact that anthroposophists are identied as critical parents with lower vaccination coverage, noresearch has been done in The Netherlands and elsewhereto explore their beliefs about childhood vaccination. Thisqualitative study was conducted, by means of focus groupdiscussions, to gain more insight into parents' experience atan anthroposophical CWC, the factors that influence theirvaccination decision-making and their need for information. 2. Methods 2.1. Participants and Procedure. In total, three focus groups (n=16) were conducted with parents who visit an anthro- posophical CWC. Doctors and nurses from three di erent anthroposophical CWCs in The Netherlands invited parentsto participate. Parents received an information letter regard-ing the study objectives and procedures and could inform theresearchers whether they wished to participate by sending anemail to an email address. Parents who did so then receivedmore details about the date and location of the focus groupdiscussions. 2.2. Study Setting. The focus groups were held in the evening at the anthroposophical CWC that the parents visited andlasted about 2 hours. Every focus group had the samemoderator (IH) and di erent assistants. Informed consent was obtained and participants received a gift voucher of C 30 as an incentive. The focus groups were held between May 2011 and June 2012 and were approved by the Psychology Ethics Committee of Maastricht University. The focus groupswere based on a semistructured protocol with open-endedquestions. The topic list was pilot tested with colleagues andthen revised. This revised and nal version was used for allthe three focus groups. The focus groups started with an introduction about the objectives of the study and the role of the participants duringthe focus group. After that, the participants introducedthemselves with their names and family composition andreasons why they visited an anthroposophical CWC. Thenparents were asked to write down what they perceivedas positive and negative aspects of the Dutch NIP . Next,more in-depth questions were asked about which factors influenced their decision whether or not to vaccinate theirchild, the influence of their social environment in theirvaccination decisions, and their need for information. Atthe end, the focus group was evaluated together with theparticipants. 2.3. Analysis. T h et h r e ef o c u sg r o u p sw e r er e c o r d e dw i t ha digital voice recorder and transcribed verbatim. The datawere processed with the software program Nvivo 9 (QSRInternational) and then analyzed based on thematic analysis[15]t oe x p l o r ed i erent factors influencing the parents' decision whether or not to vaccinate their child. Di erent themes were explored and an inductive process was usedto derive subthemes from the six main themes. The datawere analyzed and coded by the moderator (IH) and anindependent researcher analyzed and recoded one focusgroup. Afterwards initial coding was compared, reviewed,discussed, and rened until consensus was achieved, leadingto an improved coding scheme and criteria. 3. Results 3.1. Participants. The group of 16 participants consisted of two parents with one child, four parents with two children,another four with three children, one with four children,and one parent with ve children. T wo couples participated in the focus groups. One of these couples had one child and the other had two. Fourteen of the 16 participantswere females. All parents indicated that they had postponedvaccination for at least one child. One parent had refusedall vaccinations for her children, while the other parentshad partially vaccinated their child. Of the parents whopartially vaccinated their children, all refused the MMR,pneumococcal, and meningococcal C vaccinations. The DT-IPV (Diphtheria, T etanus, and Polio) vaccine was mostlyaccepted ( n =6), next the DT aP-IPV (Diphtheria, T etanus, Pertussis, and Polio) vaccine ( n=3) and then the DT aP-IPV- Hib (Diphtheria, T etanus, Pertussis, Polio, and Haemophilus influenzae type b) vaccine ( n=2). The other parents ( n=3) had not yet decided whether or not to have their childvaccinated. The six themes derived from the focus group discussion were divided into sub-themes and are described below withrelevant quotes from the participants. 3.2. Positive and Negative Aspects of the Dutch NIP. The parents agreed that one positive aspect of the Dutch NIP isthat the vaccines are free of charge and available for everyone:\"I think it's good that vaccines are available to everyone, regardless of your background. \" Some participants ( n =4) mentioned that some diseases are less prevalent thanks tovaccination. \" The rst thing that came to mind was that certain dangerous diseases are less common. \" One perceived negative aspect of the Dutch NIP was that it is a standard program: \"It's a pity that it's a standard program and there's little regard for the child's personaldevelopment, \" and that vaccinating is the general norm: \"OneAdvances in Preventive Medicine 3 thing I don't like about it is that it's considered the norm to automatically or blindly follow the program, and that if yourefuse vaccination, you have to justify your reasons. \" 3.3. Anthroposophical CWC. Because all of the parents in these focus groups visited an anthroposophical CWC, wewere interested in why they had chosen an anthroposophicalCWC and what their experiences were. 3.3.1. Reasons to Visit an Anthroposophical CWC. Some parents ( n =6) visit an anthroposophical CWC because they have an anthroposophical background, lifestyle or beliefs:\"We chose an anthroposophical CWC because it was theobvious choice for us. As a child, I always went to ananthroposophical CWC, so it was part of my upbringing. \"Another parent said: \"We chose anthroposophical health care al o n gt i m ea g ob e c a u s ei th a sad i erent view of health, and it doesn't only look at physical aspects, but also spiritual aspects. \"Other parents ( n =5) said they visited an anthroposophical CWC because they had had a negative experience at astandard CWC: \"I rst went to a regular CWC, but they were very strict and you almost felt guilty if you wanted to postponeor even considered postponing the vaccination .\" 3.3.2. Experience at Anthroposophical CWC. All participants mentioned they had a positive experience when visiting ananthroposophical CWC. Most anthroposophical CWCs havelonger consultations than standard CWCs and are thereforeable to dedicate more time to informing the parents:\"The consultations are very pleasant, there's no pressure, theinformation you get is broad and clear and they make sure thatyou've really had the chance to think through the consequences(of not vaccinating). If you have any questions at a later time,you can always call. \" The parents also indicated that they appreciated it that health care workers at anthroposophicalCWCs emphasize that parents have their own responsibilityin making choices for their children: \"They (the health care workers) make it very clear that it's your own decision. Theyinsist on nothing .\" 3.4. Factors Influencing Decision-Making. The participants described various factors that influenced their choicewhether to refuse or accept vaccinations for their children.These included lifestyle, perception of health, beliefs aboutchildhood diseases, risk perception of the diseases, percep-tions about vaccine e ectiveness and vaccine components, and trust in institutions. 3.4.1. Lifestyle. The parents indicated that the lifestyle they had might positively influence the health of their children.They tried to raise their children to be as healthy as possibleso that their immune systems would be strong and able tocope with infectious diseases .One parent said: \"Y ou can make s u r ey o u rc h i l di sh e a l t h ya n dh a sas t r o n gi m m u n es y s t e m .Ithink that's something I try to succeed in. \" Some parents ( n = 5) indicated that a peaceful environment was important: \"We had a babysitter, our children did not went to day care, so theygrew up in a quiet environment. This made me condent that Icould postpone vaccination. \" Another parent said: \"They both went to childcare at a very late age, or we had a babysitter athome, so the care that our children get is good, there was arest around them that supported them. \" Other parents ( n =6) mentioned that good nutrition such as breastfeeding was animportant protector against infectious diseases: \" Because I breastfed for a long time I thought: 'well my child will get a lot of protection from breast milk' . \" 3.4.2. Perception of Health. The perception that the parents had about the health of their children was an importantfactor in their vaccination decisions: \"I look at how well she's developed. She's not weak, she's a very strong child and I haveso much condence in her. She's so healthy and I didn't want tointerfere with that, so she hasn't been vaccinated. \" Most parents (n =9) who refused vaccinations indicated that they had a lot of condence in the health of their child: \"I have a lot of condence in children's own healing power. \" 3.4.3. Childhood Diseases. Some of the parents ( n=5) believe that certain diseases, so-called childhood diseases,are essential to the development of a child: \"Acc ording to anthroposophy, some childhood diseases contribute to yourpersonal development, diphtheria, tetanus and polio are not part of that development and so we accepted this vaccine. \" Another parent said: \"I notice that the children are a bit listless when they have fever. They have fever for a few days, andthen they make a sudden leap forward, or they start gettingteeth. I've had childhood diseases myself. I had measles quiteseverely, but once it's over you've become stronger becauseyou've overcome something. \" All parents refused the MMR vaccination, because they believe that the illnesses related tothese vaccines are childhood diseases. Some of the parents(n =3) expected their child to get the disease, but said they would reconsider vaccination if their children had not hadthe disease by a certain age: \" I ft h e y( c h i l d r e n )h a v e n i s h e d elementary school and they still haven't had MMR diseases,then we'll discuss the vaccination again. Because, well, at somepoint you're no longer a child. \" 3.4.4. Risk Perception of Disease. The decision whether or not to vaccinate is also based on the perceived severityand susceptibility of the vaccine-preventable diseases. Oneparent said about vaccine-preventable diseases in general:\"If you take a look at the percentages, there's a very small number of children who have severe cases of it (the vaccine- preventable diseases). \" Some parents ( n =8) mentioned that they believe children are highly susceptible to tetanusand therefore vaccinated their child against it: \"T etanus is the most important for me, because I think you can get thatvery easily. \" However, most parents ( n =13) mentioned that the perceived severity of the disease is important: \"We both had mumps, measles and rubella and we wedon't vaccinate against MMR. \" Another parent said: \"I think diphtheria and polio are very severe diseases, even though thec h a n c eo fg e t t i n gt h e mi sv e r ys m a l l ,s oIc a ni m a g i n et h a tw e ' l lchoose to vaccinate our daughter for that. We also vaccinatedour sons against it. \"4 Advances in Preventive Medicine 3.4.5. Vaccine E ectiveness. Some of the participants ( n=5) had doubts about the e ectiveness of the vaccines: \"The graphs and reports I've read don't prove its (the vaccination's)eectiveness to me. \" Another parent said: \"I would like to ask the Public Health Institute (PHI) to show that vaccinesare e ective, this is never shown to me. \" \"I believe that they vaccinate with components that are not e ective, that is a shame. \" 3.4.6. Vaccine Components. Parents also had doubts about the components of the vaccines: \"It (the components) is all poison that you're injecting, so there's no positive componentin a vaccination. \" Parents ( n =5) were also negative about combination vaccines, because they felt that their freedom ofchoice was limited (they could not choose separate vaccines)and because of a perceived overload for their child: \"I'm happy I didn't do it (vaccinate child with combination vaccine).How can you inject that into such a small child? And combiningvaccines, just so you only have to give one injection ...Then I think, do you really have such di erent views about it, like, well, it cannot hurt, or is it because of e ciency?\" Another parent said: \"I think that lots of parents would stop vaccinating if combination vaccines were the only vaccines o ered. But i fw e ' r ea b l et oc h o o s e ,It h i n km o r ep e o p l ew i l lc o n t i n u et ovaccinate their children because they can select which vaccinesthey want. \" 3.4.7. Trust in Institutions. There were di erent ndings about trust in institutions. A few parents ( n =2) mentioned that if their child gets sick (because they refused vaccination)they would trust the health care in The Netherlands: \"I trust the health care in the Netherlands, but rst and foremost I trustthe health of my child. \" Other parents ( n =3) mentioned trust in the processes used to develop the vaccines: \" W e l lIh a v ea lot of condence in the technical process. I mean, I trust theiraccount of what's in the cocktail, and that there aren't manyother things in it and that it's been made very carefully and withthe appropriate level of controls. \" However, parents ( n =7) did not always trust the information provided by the PHI: \"I have no condence in their (the PHI) honesty or in them being openabout how it works. I'd say the information is manipulated, notwith bad intention, but because of their convictions. \" 3.5. Responsibility for Negative Consequences. This qualitative study showed that, whichever choice the parents make, theyare willing to take responsibility for negative outcomes:\"Y ou need a strong vision. What if your child gets polio.We thought 'okay, we can deal with that. So we took thatresponsibility. \" Another parent said: \"Look, you cannot say as an anthroposophist, 'well, we rely on the fact that polio hasalmost disappeared because most people are vaccinated' . Theonly thing you can say as an anthroposophist is: 'if my childgets that disease, then that's his or her path, that's the pathof development for that particular child' . So that's the risk youtake. \" 3.6. Social Environment. The parents discussed the di er- ent experiences they had with their social environment.Sometimes their social environment, such as their family, influenced their thinking about vaccination: \"I once had a conversation with my mother about it and she said that Ireacted badly to the vaccines, just like my brother and sister. Then I thought: 'okay, if we reacted badly to the vaccines, maybe I shouldn't vaccinate my child just yet' . \" Most parents ( n =9) indicated that they did not tell other people in their social environment about their decision to refuse or postponevaccination: \"My family, well they don't even think about it. They vaccinate their children and follow the general Dutch NIP . I don't talk with them about vaccination. I do my own thing. \" Sometimes parents chose not to discuss vaccination with others in their social environment because they had receivednegative reactions in the past: \"I got social support from my mother, not from the rest. (They said) I was irresponsible; they didn't want to talk about it. \" Another parent said: \"If I did the same as my social contacts, then I'd just do it (vaccinate) and take part in the general Dutch NIP . I always have to defendmyself. \" 3.7. Information Need. A topic that was mentioned by all of the parents was their need for information. Di erent topics of information were mentioned. Almost all participants (n =12) indicated they wanted more information about the risks of vaccinating: \"More information about the risks of vaccinating. Information that explains there are risksinvolved in getting vaccinated. There's not enough of that kind of information. \" The parents also wanted more scientic facts: \"I think that information should be objective and that means being complete, so including background on the disease, percentages of fatal cases, and so forth, so you know what the risks are. So information about the side e ects as well, like the percentages of cases with side e ects, just objective scientic measurable things. \" Other parents ( n =3) mentioned that they would like more information to be provided about the vaccine components in, for example, the vaccine leaflet: \"If I buy paracetamol at the drugstore, there's a leaflet included. Why not with vaccines?\" Parents mentioned that despite the fact that they do not always trust the PHI, the institute should still provide parentswith information about the Dutch NIP: \" Anybody can put information on the Internet, so I'd say the PHI is the best sourcefor information about the Dutch NIP . \" It was mentioned and acknowledged by other parents in the focus group ( n = 6) that if the PHIs were more transparent regarding the sources they used in their education material, they would be perceived as more reliable: \" It's important that the PHI lists the references for the information given in the education materials. By doing that, they would make the informationmore reliable. \" 4. Discussion This study explored factors that influenced vaccination decision-making among parents with an anthroposophical worldview. Our ndings show that parents in this studyAdvances in Preventive Medicine 5 did not refuse all Dutch NIP vaccinations, but mostly refused the MMR vaccination. The participants made a deliberate decision whether or not to vaccinate. This is not in line with 81% of Dutch parents who are reported tomake no comparative assessment of vaccinations [ 16]. The vaccination decisions of parents in this study are related to their lifestyle, perception of health, beliefs about childhood diseases, risk perception of the diseases, perceptions aboutvaccine components and vaccine e ectiveness, and trust in institutions. A previous study indicated that there is limited time for consultations at CWCs and therefore limited time to discuss childhood vaccination with parents [ 13]. This does not apply to parents who visit an anthroposophical CWC. All parents in this study indicated that they had positive experiences whenvisiting an anthroposophical CWC and mentioned that the consultations were longer and they were provided with more information. Some parents had had a negative experience at a standard CWC and indicated that standard CWCs are notflexible enough with regard to the Dutch NIP . These negativeexperiences may have resulted in their reluctance to acceptthe Dutch NIP and PHI guidance. Parents in this study are not fully opposed to childhood vaccination. Mostly these parents refuse the MMR vaccina- tion because they perceive measles, mumps, and rubella to be childhood diseases that are essential for the physical and mental development of their child. This is consistent with ndings among anthroposophists by Du ell (2001) [ 10]. The rejection of the MMR vaccination is also reflected in lower vaccination coverage for the MMR vaccine [ 6-11] and outbreaks of measles among anthroposophists [ 6,9- 11]. Another factor that influences parents' choice whether or not to vaccinate is the low perceived risk of the vaccine-preventable diseases, which is also shown in other studies [17-19]. In addition, this study shows that the perceived severity of a disease seems to be more important than theperceived susceptibility to that disease. Parents indicated that they were aware of the possible negative outcomes of not vaccinating their child and were willing to take responsibility for those outcomes. Most Dutch NIP vaccinations are combination vaccines. The parents were quite negative about the combination vaccines because of the perceived overload of the immune system (an anxiety also felt by parents who accepted all childhood vaccination [ 20,21]) and because it limits their choices in vaccinating (parents can only vaccinate theirchildren with combination vaccines and cannot choose separate vaccines). This point of view seems in line with wishes of anthroposophical CVPs to o er a flexible schedule and no combination vaccines [ 13], while CVPs at a regular CWC were positive about the combination vaccines because of their e ciency [ 13]. Some studies mentioned that another important factor for refusing vaccination is the side e ects [2,10]. The parents in our study were specically concerned about the negative e ects of the vaccine components. Besides that, some parents in this study had doubts about the e cacy of the vaccines. The ndings above suggest that determinantsthat are associated with vaccination decision-making among anthroposophists are comparable to determinants held by parents in general. Only the view about healthy child devel-opment and childhood diseases distinguishes the parents inthis study from parents in general. Another topic that is raised by di erent studies among parents who refuse vaccination is their information need [22-24]. Parents in this study indicated they need informa- tion about the risks of vaccination as well as the componentsand e ectiveness of the vaccines, and that they would like to receive more detailed scientic information. Not onlythe parents would like more information, anthroposophicalCVPs have also indicated that they need more information tobetter educate parents [ 13]. Parents mentioned the CVPs as the most important source of information about childhoodvaccination [ 25,26]. The focus should, therefore, not only be on providing information to parents, but also to CVPs,which would enable them to provide parents with more andbetter information. In addition, if parents' information needsare not fullled, they might start searching for informationthemselves, with the result that their vaccination decision-making may be influenced by widespread antivaccine mes- sages [ 27-29]. Parents do not always trust the PHI, but the institute is still perceived as the most important, logical, andreliable information source about the Dutch NIP . T o increasethe reliability of the information provided by the PHI,references should be listed about the information sourcesused in their education material. It should be mentioned that this study has some limitations. First, it might be that our study did not reachfull saturation [ 30]. During the third focus group, no new themes emerged, compared to the former two focus groups,so we assumed that more focus groups were unnecessary butwe did not test this by conducting a nal focus group. Thesecond limitation of our study is that we have no insight intothe parents' demographic variables, like levels of education.A study by Hak et al. (2005) [ 31] showed that highly educated parents are more critical towards childhood vaccination.Third, there is potential for moderator bias in this study [ 32]. We tried to avoid this by the use of a standardized topic list,an assistant who was present at the focus groups, digital voicerecorder, and verbatim transcriptions. Further quantitative research on perceptions about the (Dutch) NIP is needed to be able to generalize results.The six themes that emerged from these results could beuseful for developing quantitative research about parents, and anthroposophical parents in particular, who are critical of childhood vaccination. Quantitative research is alsoneeded to get more insight in which determinants are mostimportant in the decision making of parents with an anthro-posophical worldview and whether these determinants aredierent from determinants influencing vaccine refusal in general. 5. Conclusion This study showed that anthroposophical parents in thisstudy are not opposed to vaccination in general. Their6 Advances in Preventive Medicine decision is not solely based on weighing the risks of vaccination against those of nonvaccination; it also dependson the parents' lifestyle and views about healthy childdevelopment. Parents in this study reported a need forinformation about childhood vaccination. However, notall parents want the same amount of information that these parents require. Layered information might therefore be an appropriate method to fulll the information needof all parents. Su cient references to sources containing more information about childhood vaccination should beprovided, especially regarding the e ectiveness of vaccines and vaccine components and the benets and risks ofvaccination, such as the possible side e ects. This may satisfy parents' information needs and enable them tomake a su ciently informed choice whether or not to vaccinate their child. Further research is needed on how thisinformation can best reach the parents who need it and ifthe information geared towards anthroposophical parentsshould be di erent from information geared towards parents that refuse childhood vaccination in general.
