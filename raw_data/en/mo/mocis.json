Each of the food groups in the pyramid emphasizes health-promoting choices. The pyramid encourages you to eat virtually unlimited amounts of vegetables and fruits because of their beneficial effects on both weight and health. The main message is simple: Eat most of your food from the groups at the base of the pyramid and less from the top \u2014 and move more. Increase your physical activity The Mayo Clinic Diet provides practical and realistic ideas for including more physical activity and exercise throughout your day \u2014 as well as finding a plan that works for you.

It also emphasizes moving more throughout the day, such as taking the stairs instead of an elevator. If you've been inactive or you have a medical condition, talk to your doctor or health care provider before starting a new physical activity program. Most people can begin with five- or 10-minute activity sessions and increase the time gradually. What's a typical daily menu? The Mayo Clinic Diet provides a choice of five different eating styles at several calorie levels. Whether you would like to follow the Mayo Clinic Diet meal plan, are vegetarian or prefer the Mediterranean eating style, you will find an abundance of recipes and meals that won't leave you hungry.

The Mayo Clinic Diet is generally safe for most adults. It does encourage unlimited amounts of vegetables and fruits. For most people, eating lots of fruits and vegetables is a good thing \u2014 these foods provide your body with important nutrients and fiber. However, if you aren't used to having fiber in your diet, you may experience minor, temporary changes in digestion, such as intestinal gas, as your body adjusts to this new way of eating. Also, the natural sugar in fruit does affect your carbohydrate intake \u2014 especially if you eat a lot of fruit. This may temporarily raise your blood sugar or certain blood fats. However, this effect is lessened if you are losing weight. If you have diabetes or any other health conditions or concerns, work with your doctor to adjust the [Mayo Clinic Diet](https://diet.mayoclinic.org/us/how-it-works/how-it-works/?source=mayo&utm_source=mayo&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=TheMCD) for your situation. For example, people with diabetes should aim for more vegetables than fruits, if possible. It's a good idea to snack on vegetables, rather than snacking only on fruit.
