Our vision at Marie Veronique is to deliver the safest and most effective skincare available, by translating nature's genius into innovative formulations. ABOUT MARIE VERONIQUE Marie-Veronique Nadeau is a chemist who founded Marie Veronique in 2002. An inventor at heart who suffered from teenage acne, she was moved to create her own products when she could find nothing on the market that was clean and effective to address her rosacea. From there, she went on to develop a line for acne and was one of the first to formulate a non-nano zinc oxide sunscreen. She continues to lead the way towards safe yet effective skincare, determined to move an industry ensconced in hype into the realm of science. She is a trained esthetician, holds degrees in Math and Science, and is a former high school chemistry teacher. She collaborates with her daughter, Jay Nadeau, physicist and bio-medical engineer, to carefully choose each ingredient in her products to solve real skin issues and address the causes of aging at the source. Our vision at Marie Veronique is to deliver superior, non-toxic skincare drawing on nature's genius and the brain of science through innovative formulations. Achieving optimal skin health and healing real skin issues drive us to produce safe products that truly work.

Achieving optimal skin health and healing real skin issues drive us to produce safe products that truly work. Acne is usually a result of elevated testosterone levels increasing sebum production. The excess sebum and the bacteria that feed on it, as well as dead skin cells and assorted debris, collect in the pores. The resulting congestion can lead to inflammation, which culminates in a case of acne. Conventional treatments battle breakouts with topical cleansers, exfoliants, antimicrobials, antibiotics and, in serious cases of cystic acne, drugs like Accutane. Now new research suggests that certain vitamins, taken internally as well as applied topically, offer an effective alternative approach to treating acne\u2014without the side effects. This story will explore your options. Let's start with a close-up on the biggest bully on the block first: Accutane. [Accutane](http://www.acne.org/accutane.html) is a vitamin A derivative (13-cis-retinoic acid) that is administered orally in pill form, normally for 15-20 weeks. It was originally recommended for people with severe acne who may be unresponsive to other acne treatments. More recently, it's gained in popularity and is often prescribed for less severe acne. Accutane works by shrinking sebaceous glands, which reduces oil secretion and P. acnes colonization\u2014and thus inflammation. The treatment itself can be very effective, however the side effects are numerous and widespread, affecting upwards of 80% of patients. Most often these side effects are mild to moderate and reversible, but in some cases, they can be severe or long-term. The most common side effect is chronic dryness which can lead to further skin issues such as microbial imbalance, infection, and even recurrent breakouts. Vitamin B5 (aka pantethine or pantothenic acid) is as effective as the drug Accutane in treating acne because it also works at the first stage of acne formation. But whereas Accutane shrinks sebaceous glands, vitamin B5 reduces oil production of the sebaceous glands by increasing coenzyme A, which increases the metabolic breakdown of oils\u2014including sebum\u2014by optimizing the normal activity of cell physiology. The program originally suggested by Dr. Lit-Hung Leung (1997) relied on patients ingesting 5-10 grams of pantothenic acid a day. [Dr. Jeffrey Dach](http://www.drdach.com/Acne_B5.html) suggests a \"modified Leung B5 protocol with Pantethine 750 mg with 250 mg of L Carnitine three times a day.\" Vitamin B3 (aka niacinamide or nicotinamide) is an anti-inflammatory \" [verifiable beneficial effects](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1473-2130.2004.00115.x/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\u2014[it is used to improve] epidermal barrier function, aging skin, pigmentary disorders and for use on skin prone to acne.\" Niacinamide also reduces facial [sebum](http://www.dermnetnz.org/acne/sebum.html) production. Vitamin B5 optimizes the breakdown of fats released by the sebaceous gland, thus reducing congestion and heading acne formation off at the pass. Meanwhile vitamin B3 or niacinamide's many beneficial anti-inflammatory effects maintain skin health. The combination is formidable enough to help with most cases of acne, even severe or of long duration, but it is not an overnight solution. Patience is required.
