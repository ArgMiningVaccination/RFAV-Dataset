These include herbs prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda and Homeopathy. The lack of oversight has led to concerns of adulteration or misbranding. These products are also not classified as drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The use of herbs and supplements during an inpatient admission at Memorial Hospital is prohibited. The exceptions to this policy are products that are used in Institutional Review Board-approved protocols (clinical trials). When patients are admitted to Memorial Hospital, they are asked about the use of herbs and other dietary supplements and this is documented in the electronic medical record. Concerns about the safety and effectiveness are explained, and patients are asked to comply with this policy. "}
