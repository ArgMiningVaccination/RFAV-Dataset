(Photo by Martine Perret/UNMIT)Message from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon The unprecedented global demand for United Nations Police reflects a growing understanding of the beneficial role they are playing in war-torn countries during the crucial post-conflict stabilization phase. Within the overall framework of establishing the rule of law, UN Police work towards the sustainable development of law and order institutions. In addition to protecting individuals, they help society as a whole by redefin-ing the role of policing in countries emerging from conflict, forging trust in uniformed police, establishing faith in national justice systems and fostering confidence in peace processes. By working with UN civilian and military personnel to protect local populations, disarm ex-combatants, supervise elections and help build and strengthen State institutions, UN Police officers play a vital role in guiding fragile States to stability. Their presence paves the way for the creation of democratic soci-eties where people once blighted by war can enjoy lasting peace. Message from Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Alain Le Roy The challenges faced by UN peacekeeping operations continue to expand and multiply. From the dense jungles of Congo to the arid deserts of Sudan, UN peacekeeping is today called upon to play increasingly complex and multi-dimensional roles in some of the world's most intractable conflicts. UN peacekeeping operations are the cornerstone of the international com-munity's response to international crises. This is reflected in the complexity of UN Police work, which has evolved dramatically in scope and scale since the early days of police peacekeep-ing in the 1960s. Today more than 11,000 UN Police officers from 100 countries and over 112,000 peacekeepers are deployed in 18 missions across the globe. These officers perform a crucial role, helping to create a secure environment where communities will be better protected and criminal activities will be prevented. UN Police Officers conduct patrols, provide training, advise na-tional police services, ensure compliance with human rights standards and provide a wide range of assistance to improve daily living conditions for vulnerable civilian populations. We are redoubling our efforts to consolidate peace for those who continue to suffer in the shadow of violence and insecurity and we honour the brave men and women who continue to serve the noble cause of peace in the most difficult of conditions. April 2009 | 1 UN POLICE MAGAZINEUN POLICE MAGAZINE 2 | JUl Y 2009Welcome to the first edition of the UN Police Magazine for 2009. The theme for this publication is the impact of organized crime on our peacekeeping missions. Or - ganised crime should be viewed as a major spoiler to peacekeeping and peacebuilding. One of the most in-sidious features of organized crime is the corrosive and toxic effect it has through the corruption of officials. It is a catalyst for instability and if it is left unchecked it can undermine all of our efforts to build long-term security in fragile, post-conflict societies. Many of our missions have assisted local law enforce- ment authorities to establish mechanisms to deal with some of the more obvious organized criminal activities, including drug production and trafficking, human traf-ficking, exploitation of natural resources and weapons trafficking. At Headquarters we are working closely with UNODC, ICPO-Interpol, regional groups and Member States to design effective and sustainable strategies that will help to better protect transitional societies from this insidious scourge. Police peacekeeping remains an area of exponential growth for the UN. At the time of publication we have over 11,500 male and female police peacekeepers in the field. This could swell to 15-16,000 by the end of 2009, as the United Nations Mission in Darfur reaches its full strength. But it's not just about numbers. Police peacekeepers are now tasked with a wide array of responsibilities, includ-ing executive policing, close operational support, police reform and capacity building. Never has the international demand for qualified and experienced police officers been greater - or the challenges as daunting. With these increased numbers and responsibilities has come increased exposure to risk. In 2008, 24 police peacekeepers paid the ultimate sacrifice in working to protect some of the most disadvantaged and marginalized people in the world. We remember them with heavy hearts, but also a sense of pride as they epitomize the highest val-ues of policing - service, protection and placing the safety and well-being of others above one's own. We owe it to these brave officers to redouble our efforts to restore peace and security to the troubled regions of the world. Commissioner Andrew Hughes UN Police Adviser(UN Photo)UN POLICE MAGAZINE As part of its mandate to create stable and secure environments UN Police are working with interna-tional policing and law enforcement experts to find ways to prevent, disrupt and dismantle organized crime in post-conflict situations. Organized crime dominated discussions at key international policing conferences in 2008, in-cluding the INTERPOL General Assembly in St. Petersburg, the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference in San Diego and the In-ternational Policing Advisory Council meeting in Stockholm. \"We are able to contribute a unique perspective on transnational organized crime based on our experi-ence in peace operations and in turn we benefit greatly from the expertise of regional and interna-tional policing organizations in tackling organized crime networks,\" according to United Nations Po-lice Adviser Andrew Hughes. \"UN Police is currently the first provider of 'po- licekeepers' deployed worldwide to help foster sustainable peace, rebuild shattered states and promote human rights and good governance,\" Commissioner Hughes said. \"A number of peacekeeping operations are on the front line in the international community's at-tempts to combat organized crime in countries re-covering from conflict. The international policing community must work together to develop strat-egies to address the issue of transnational orga-nized crime, which can act as a major spoiler to international efforts to restore law and order and re-establish peace and security,\" Commissioner Hughes said. UN peacekeeping operations have been tasked to combat a wide range of organized crime including gang and drug crime in Haiti, human trafficking and financial crime in Kosovo, illicit drug traf-ficking in Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone, illicit arms trafficking in the Democratic Republic of Congo, illicit timber trading in Liberia and the il-legal economy in Timor-Leste. UN Police also work with national police services to build their capac-ity to target organized crime. Recent initiatives that have resulted from the rap- idly expanding cooperation between UN Police and INTERPOL include joint assessment missions to Haiti and West Africa. UN Police contribute to global response to organized crime INTERPOL Secretary General Ronald Noble and UN Police Adviser Andrew Hughes at INTERPOL's 77th General Assembly in St. Petersburg. (UN photo) JUlY 2009 | 3UN POLICE MAGAZINE \"Never before has the level of cooperation between our respective organizations been translated into such tangible outcomes that are improving the ca- pacity and capability of local law enforcement to con- front and combat organized crime,\" Commissioner Hughes told INTERPOL's 77th General Assembly. INTERPOL Secretary-General Ron Noble said po- lice worldwide have a unique opportunity to in- crease their participation in international peace operations. \"Not only is it widely known that criminal activi- ties such as drug and arms trafficking fuel wars, but countries recovering from conflicts also require the presence of a competent and honest police service in order to rebuild a state of law, which is indispensable for the building of a sustainable se-curity and the consolidation of a durable peace,\" he said. The International Policing Advisory Council (IPAC), a group of policing and law enforcement experts brought together by the Police Division of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, has also put transnational crime at the top of its agenda. At the fourth annual IPAC meeting in Stockholm participants examined different models of infor - mation and intelligence collection and analysis. One hundred and twelve UN Member States have committed to combating organized crime through the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, signed in Palermo in 2000. n Human trafficking rings arrested UN Police are assisting national police services in their efforts to break human trafficking rings and are beginning to generate tangible results. In 2008 UN Police officers intervened in a number of cases of human trafficking in Timor Leste, Haiti and Ko-sovo, rescuing over thirty-five maltreated women, men and children from abusers and breaking a trafficking ring that sold human organs. Trafficking of women and children for sexual ex- ploitation and abuse is a transnational crime in-volving an intricate web of criminals from recruit-ers to brothel owners to corrupt law enforcement and migration officials. An estimated 2.4 million women and children are trafficked annually across international borders and within states for prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation and forced labour. In Timor-Leste, UN and national police raided two bars in Dili suspected of sex trafficking. Police ar - rested the bar managers and detained 21 women and seven men from China, Indonesia, Malaysia UN and national police raid a bar in Dili, Timor-Leste, suspected of involvement in sex trafficking.

Criminal gangs are blamed for much of Haiti's vio- lence and a spate of kidnappings in recent years. UN Police with the UN Stabilization Mission in Hai- ti, known as MINUSTAH, launched more than 100 Special Operations in 2008, including drug sei-zures, anti-kidnapping and anti-gang operations. There were 263 kidnapping cases in Haiti in 2008, a marked decrease from 500 cases in 2006. The Special Representative of the Secretary- General in Haiti, Hedi Annabi, said the secu-rity situation had clearly improved in the second half of 2008. During this period, UN Police increased the number of checkpoints to 2,295 and helped the Haiti National Police (HNP) to arrest 4,636 suspects. \"Today the level of criminality is lower in Haiti than in several other countries in the region,\" Mr. Annabi said. \"This is due to a greater number of Haitian Na- tional Police and a progressive improvement in their performance and the cooperation of the pop-ulation. It also reflects the good collaboration be-tween the HNP and MINUSTAH,\" he said. \"We will continue this collaboration throughout 2009, according even greater attention to securing the borders. MINUSTAH recently received 16 boats Kidnappings, gang and drug crime in Haiti decrease due to police operationsand Timor-Leste as suspects related to human trafficking. UN Police officers ensured that victim assistance was available and monitored the treat- ment of the female victims. However, due to lack of witnesses the traffickers were not prosecuted and the suspects were released, reflecting the difficulties that law enforcement officials face in bringing perpetrators to justice. In Haiti, UN and national police officers rescued four trafficked children aged from two to six years old and arrested the trafficker. They also rescued three girls, aged four to 10 years old, suffering from maltreatment in an orphanage. UN Police have provided training courses in Libe- ria, East Timor, Georgia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kosovo and Haiti to build the capacity of national law enforcement officers to address hu-man trafficking. They also assist police operations to combat traf- ficking in human organs. An increasing demand for organ transplants worldwide is fuelling the il-licit trade in kidneys, liver, heart and other hu-man tissues. On 4 November 2008, UN Police deployed with the United Nations Mission in Kosovo worked with authorities to arrest two doctors and the manager of a private clinic in Pristina for trafficking in human organs. During the investigation, police officers intercepted three Turkish men at Pristina airport who had had their kidneys extracted at the clinic for US$20,000. The police also ap- prehended a government official at the Ministry of Health who had issued an illegal license to the clinic and arrested a trafficker in Turkey who had recruited one of the organ donors. The police investigation showed that the arrested traffickers were of Turkish, Israeli and Kosovan nationality, while most of the suspected organ donors came from eastern Europe and the Middle East. The police believe that the trafficking ring belonged to a wider international network of an organized criminal group. nUN POLICE MAGAZINE which are going to assist the HNP to conduct its basic maritime police functions.\" The deployment of a component of maritime police in areas surrounding the main ports compliments UN Police efforts to promote security, fight trafficking, facilitate the col-lection of customs duties and reinforce the authority of the State. UN Police also worked with the HNP to seize 50 kilograms of cannabis in a large-scale an-ti-drug operation in December 2008, in the first joint drug seizure of its kind in Haiti. The raid struck three sites in the south of the country. The largest capture came from a dis-used nightclub near a beach in Aquin, where UN Police and HNP found 35 kilograms of cannabis. Four motor boats were subsequently destroyed by court order. \"This old nightclub served as a base for traffickers. The boats are powerful enough to make the trip to Jamaica, where drugs shipped to that region of Haiti generally come from,\" said UN Director of Police Op-erations, Jean-Marie Bourry. The December raids seized another 15 ki- lograms of cannabis on the property of an alleged drug dealer on the island of Grosse Caye, opposite Aquin. \"This is the first time that MINUSTAH has carried out a special operation of this mag-nitude, bringing together so many people. It was a combination of helicopter, sea and land efforts,\" said Mr. Bourry. \"One of the objectives of this operation was to show that the police can intervene in Haiti in coordination and en masse based on the information obtained,\" he said. There are more than 2,000 police officers deployed with MINUSTAH, including seven Formed Police Units. n UN and National Police plan an anti-drug operation in Haiti.

Sierra Leone and Guinea Bissau are ma- jor routes for shipment of hard drugs. Since the civil war in the 1990s, Sierra Leone has been used as a transit point for trafficking in cocaine and heroin from South America to Europe. Rudolfo Landeros, Senior Police Adviser with the United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL), is working with national, regional and internation-al law enforcement agencies to combat drug trafficking in the region.Mr. Landeros played a key role in estab-lishing the Sierra Leone Joint Drug In-terdiction Task Force in 2008. The Task Force had its first major success when it seized more than 700 kilograms of co-caine at Freetown's Lungi International Airport on 13 July 2008. The drug traffickers used a twin-engine propeller aircraft, modified for in-flight refueling, to fly the plane directly from Venezuela. After the aircraft landed, the crew immediately fled the airport in a car, ramming an airport perimeter fence. Si-erra Leone Police seized the aircraft, as well as 703.5 kilograms of cocaine and five AK-47 submachine guns.UN Police target drug trafficking in West Africa UNIOSIL Senior Police Adviser Rudolfo Landeros with members of the Sierra Leone Joint Drug Interdiction Task Force (UN photo) JUlY 2009 | 7UN POLICE MAGAZINE 8 | JUl Y 2009The Liberian National Police (LNP) together with UN Police are tackling the drug trade in remote areas of the West African nation, seizing 1,000 kilograms of marijuana in joint raids in 2008. During the 14-year civil war that killed almost 150,000 people, mostly civilians, warlords gave marijuana to their young soldiers, including chil-dren, to alleviate stress and to create dependency. Left in shambles by the conflict, the economy of- fers few employment opportunities, with many youths still addicted to drugs five years after the end of the war. LNP and UN Police have coordinated operations to identify and destroy marijuana plantations. Nearly 450,000 plants have been destroyed. \"A major aim of these operations is to build the ca- pacity of the LNP,\" said United Nations Mission in Liberia Police Commissioner Henrik Stiernblad. Relying on intelligence from the Sierra Leone Cen- tral Intelligence and Security Unit, the SLP imme-diately developed an operational plan which, with-in 12 hours of the landing of the aircraft, resulted in raids on multiple locations and the arrest of key suspects in the drug smuggling conspiracy. Among those arrested were eight suspects from Columbia, Venezuela, Cuba and the USA. Assets seized included houses, high-speed boats, com-munication and maritime navigation equipment. \"This drug seizure was a milestone in the battle against drug trafficking and organized crime. It is the first large-scale cocaine seizure in Sierra Le-one which resulted in arrests,\" Mr. Landeros said.\"The successful drug seizure demonstrates the ef-fectiveness of police and law enforcement agen-cies when they work together on an international level,\" he said. The operation was carried out by Sierra Leone Po- lice (SLP) in cooperation with the Sierra Leone Of-fice of National Security, the British Serious Orga-nized Crime Agency, UN Police and UNIOSIL. The Joint Drug Interdiction Task Force consists of members of the SLP, the Office of National Se-curity, the Central Intelligence and Security Unit, Immigration, the National Revenue Authority, the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces Maritime Wing and the Sierra Leone National Drug Law En-forcement Agency. n Joint Operation: Liberian and UN Police destroy marijuana plantations A Nigerian Formed Police Unit conducting a joint raid with National Police in Bong County, Liberia (UNMIL Photo by Christopher Herwig)UN POLICE MAGAZINE The position of United Nations Deputy Police Ad- viser was established in 2008 to assist the UN Police Adviser in the daily management of the Po-lice Division. The UN Police Division is responsible for the stra- tegic direction and management of all policing issues in peace operations, including the launch of new police operations in response to Secu-rity Council resolutions. The Police Adviser also has overall responsibility for the activities of the Standing Police Capacity. Ann-Marie Orler, a Police Commissioner with the Swedish National Police, was appointed as the first UN Deputy Police Adviser in May 2008. In addition to nearly 20 years of police service, Commissioner Orler has strong experience in management, insti-tutional development and policy-making. She has served as Secretary-General of Amnesty International in Sweden and was a member of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture in the Council of Europe. Commissioner Orler works closely with and is the Deputy to UN Police Adviser Andrew Hughes, a senior officer with the Australian Federal Police. Commissioner Hughes has 32 years experience as a police officer, including overseeing Australian con-tributions to UN peacekeeping operations in Timor-Leste and Cyprus. He also served as Commander of the Fiji Police from 2003-2006, over-seeing Fijian deployment to United Nations peacekeep-ing missions in Kosovo, Liberia and Sudan. nUN Deputy Police Adviser role establishedLiberian police are now commanding raids. LNP led a surprise stop and search operation in Bong County in October 2008. Officers pulled over a car and found four large sacks of cassava, which they sliced open to reveal tightly packed bags containing over 50 kilo-grams of dried marijuana. The raid was the result of six months surveillance and intelligence gathering.Liberian police acknowledge that eradicating plan-tations is a difficult task, given many communities' reliance on marijuana for their income. Anti-nar - cotics officers say young Liberians need training to give them the skills to find employment. n \" I have no doubt that the world should eventually have an integrated police force which will be ac-cepted as part of life in the same way as national police forces are accepted. Meanwhile, we must be sure that developments are in the right direc-tion and we can also meet critical situations as and when they occur.\" U Thant Secretary-General, 3 June 1963 JUlY 2009 | 9Deputy Police Adviser Ann-Marie Orler. (UN Photo)UN POLICE MAGAZINE 10 | JUl Y 2009Contributing police officers to United Nations mis- sions enhances the professionalism of national po-lice services through exposure to standards of ex-cellence in international policing and specialized training to strengthen police peacekeeping skills, according to many senior members of the interna-tional policing community. Police Contributing Countries (PCCs) see clear benefits for their local communities when their po-lice officers return from UN missions. Bangladesh and Nepal are two of the largest PCCs. Bangladesh contributes 1,351 police officers to UN peacekeeping missions. Bangladesh Police Deputy Inspector General Mohammad Mokhlesur Rahman said working with United Nations Police had im-proved the service's multi-agency approach, mod-ern crime scene management, techniques of inves-tigation, conflict resolution, leadership capabilities, communication skills and technology skills. Bangladesh Police are contributing their expertise in public order management and community polic-ing, and expanded their knowledge of victim sup-port, human rights and gender mainstreaming. \"It is a two-way contribution. We are exporting our experience and we are learning from a cosmopoli-tan environment,\" Deputy Inspector General Rah-man said. \"Through participation in UN peacekeeping op- erations, Bangladesh police officers are widening Police Contributing Countries see lasting benefits of UN deployment Bangladesh Police perform a roadblock and vehicle search exercise during pre-deployment training for UN peacekeeping missions (UN photo)UN POLICE MAGAZINE their vision, accepting good practices of policing throughout the world and upgrading professional-ism to global standards,\" he said. Bangladesh has police officers deployed with the UN in Liberia, Ivory Coast, Sudan, Timor Leste, Democratic Republic of Congo and Afghanistan. Since its first mission in 1989 in Namibia, Ban-gladesh has contributed 4,379 police officers to 18 missions. Nepal Police Inspector General Hem Bahadur Gu- rung highlighted the opportunity to learn from the professional expertise and experience of other in-ternational police officers. \"UN Mission experience also provides ample op- portunity to learn about the diverse culture and values which will, in turn, widen the vision of our officers, enabling them to apply the best UN prac-tices after they return home. This has benefited Nepal Police as well as the Nepalese community,\" Inspector General Gurung said. Nepal Armed Police Force Inspector General Basu Dev Olee also pointed to the knowledge gained about international law and justice and the expo-sure to implementing international humanitarian law and international human rights law. \"In one week on a UN Mission, they can learn more than from reading 10 books,\" Inspector Gen-eral Olee said. \"The Government of Nepal is keen to support inter - national peace efforts and is promoting more UN deployment,\" he said. At the beginning of 2009, 809 Nepalese police officers were deployed with UN missions in Haiti, Sudan, Liberia, Timor Leste, Kosovo and Afghanistan. Since its first UN deployment to the Former Yu-goslavia in 1992, Nepal has contributed more than 2,500 police officers to 21 missions. Nepal is planning to establish a UN training centre to facilitate further deployment. Bangladesh and Nepal were the first countries to deploy Formed Police Units to the United Nations Mission in Darfur, in 2007 and 2008 respectively, in extremely harsh conditions. n 02004006008001,0001,2001,400 JordanBangladesh Nigeria Nepal Pakistan India Ghana Senegal Zambia Philippines1,351 1,175 807 782 670 593 540 491 299293 0100200300400500600700800 Nigeria India Ghana Zambia South Africa Nepal Cameroon Philippines C\u00f4te d'Ivoire CanadaFemale police of/f_icers 451749 268 138 100 84259 107161131 88 40 36 33 30 25 21 21UN Police Top 10 Contributors - June 2009 JUlY 2009 | 11UN POLICE MAGAZINE 12 | JUl Y 2009 Changing lives in Darfur: Oberlene Whyte brings hope to women sheltering in camps Oberlene Angela Whyte was warned that she was bound to fail as the first female Team Site Commander in Sudan's war-ravaged Darfur region. However, under the leadership of this UN Po- lice Adviser from Jamaica, the Tawilla Team Site became a haven for internally displaced persons (IDPs) to shelter from the conflict. Rather than being disregarded because she is female, as skeptics had feared, Ms. Whyte be-came fully engaged with the local communi-ties, working with umdas (traditional leaders) and sheiks, women, youth and local police. She participates in all phases of community life, attending weddings, births and funerals. \"I feel valued and appreciated by the com- munity,\" Ms. Whyte said. \"The people feel secure with the presence of the UN Police and they never fail to express it.\" Protection of civilians is at the heart of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID). Community Policing is central to this endeavor, with 70 percent of the 2,000 individual police officers deployed in Darfur working with local communities. \"My deployment with UNAMID has been a tremendous experience, equipping me with the skills and knowledge to appreciate and to coexist with people of different cultures, reli-gion and ethnic background,\" she added. Ms. Whyte supervises four Community Polic- ing Centres, which recruits Community Polic-ing Volunteers, provide security for IDPs and build the capacity of the local police in the ar - eas of human rights, investigation techniques and gender-based violence. \"We take every opportunity to educate the community on gender issues. For example, UNAMID Police Adviser Oberlene Whyte leads a cooking day in a camp for internally dis- placed persons in Tawilla, Darfur. (UN photo)UN POLICE MAGAZINE we explain that female mutilation is an abuse of human rights, we remind the men that good men don't abuse women, good men take care of their families and they need to educate their girls and protect their children,\" she noted. Ms. Whyte organized ongoing English classes for IDPs, finding a former teacher in the community to conduct lessons. UN Police Officers used their own funds to provide books, blackboards and stationary. \"The umdas and sheiks were very excited about the classes and the women most of all were elated at the prospect of learning English. The participants are now able to communicate in English, which for me is a very rich reward,\" Ms. Whyte said. Ms. Whyte formed women's groups in Tawilla IDP Camp, Tawilla Town and Umburunga. \"We are very pleased with the outcome as the wom- en came to acknowledge that being in a structured group is better for representation, advancement of the issues that affects them and in garnering the help they so desperately need,\" she said. \"It was very rewarding to see how interested the women were in having their meetings and how ex-cited they were to be part of a women's union and to speak about issues that affect them.\"But UN Police Officers face enormous challenges, above all the lack of resources available to IDPs. \"The suffering of the people, especially, the wom- en and children, is insurmountable and very pain-ful, from the lack of water to the lack of livelihood skills,\" Ms. Whyte said. \"Seeing local soldiers die after a conflict, seeing mothers giving birth in makeshift houses with no ceilings, seeing women walk for eight hours in one direction to collect firewood ... the challenges are many,\" she added. Ms. Whyte said her experience with UNAMID has been a steep learning curve. \"I have learnt the art of negotiation, which is a part of my daily work with the community, and communication with different people who have varied needs and problems,\" she said. \"I have learnt to be humble when I see how people, especially women, survive in such difficult situa-tions and still find the spirit to laugh.\" n JUlY 2009 | 13UNAMID Police Adviser Oberlene Whyte briefs Civil Affairs Officer Simona Vaclavikova and Human Rights Officer Sheerin Alaraj on the Tawilla Team Site, Darfur.(UN photo)UN POLICE MAGAZINE UN POLICE MAGAZINE Actual / Projected Deployment of UN Police in Peacekeeping Missions (June 2009) MINURSO Western Sahara 6 / 6 UNMIS Sudan 629 / 715UNMIK Kosovo 21 / 21UNFICYP Cyprus 68 / 69UNOMIG Georgia 14 / 20UNAMA Afghanistan 7 / 8 UNMIT Timor-Leste 1,485 / 1,608MINUSTAH 2,049 / 2,091UNAMID Chad 241 / 300UNMIL Liberia 1,200 MONUC D.

Only eight percent of UN Police Officers are female, an increase from four percent in 2006, but still a marked imbalance. \"We are actively recruiting female police officers, particularly at a senior level, in order to address this gender disparity in policing,\" UN Deputy Police Adviser Ann-Marie Orler said. \"As peacekeeping operations become more multi-dimensional, greater representation of women is needed to strengthen our abil-ity to carry out mandates,\" she said.

(UN photo)The Security Council adopted resolution 1325 on 31 October 2000, and among its key provisions, it: u reaffirms the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace-building, and stresses the importance of their equal participation and full involve- ment in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security, and the need to increase their role in decision-making with regard to conflict prevention and resolution; u requests the Secretary-General to provide to Member States training guidelines and materials on the protection, rights and the particular needs of women, as well as on the importance of involving women in all peace- keeping and peacebuilding measures.UN POLICE MAGAZINE JUlY 2009 | 17UN Police also help national police services in- crease their recruitment of female police officers so that they can reflect the communities they serve. Greater representation of women in police services helps countries recovering from conflict to protect women and children from violence and abuse. During conflicts, rape and other forms of sexual violence are often perpetrated by men in uniform, so that when the fighting subsides, women fear turning to uniformed forces for assistance. UN Police perform a vital role in creating trust in uniformed police as they rebuild, reform and restruc- ture national police services. They train and mentor national police officers in order to establish profes-sional local police services, which become a perma-nent source of protection for women and children. \"Police services are more effective when both sex- es are represented. For instance, women suffering from domestic violence might fear talking to male police officers,\" Commissioner Orler said. \"In the long term, addressing violence against women and children should not be the sole domain of female police officers, but in post-conflict situa- tions you first need to build trust so that women feel comfortable turning to police for help,\" she said.UN Police spearheaded the development and the adoption of landmark policies on sexual exploita-tion, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and gender mainstreaming in the Sierra Leone Police (SLP). This was the first time a West African police force implemented such policies. Adopted in July 2008, the policies ensure zero tolerance against sexual exploitation, harassment and abuse within the Si- erra Leone Police Force. UN Police assisted the SLP setting up Family Support Units. Training modules were developed to help SLP officers respond to cases of sexual as- sault and domestic violence. UN Police also had resounding success in Libe- ria, with the deployment of the first-ever all female Formed Police Unit, from India. As role models, they have encouraged many young Liberian women to become police officers. Female police officers now comprise 13 percent of the 3,800-strong LNP. \"They have greatly contributed to the healing that is needed by all Liberians recovering from the civil war and have shown that women need not be vic- tims, but healers and protectors in the new Liberia,\" said the Special Representative of the Secretary- General, Ellen Margrethe L\u00f8j. n02004006008001,0001,2001,400 JordanBangladesh Nigeria Nepal Pakistan Ghana Senegal 1,175 807 782 670 593 540 491 299293 0100200300400500600700800 Nigeria India Ghana Zambia South Africa Nepal Cameroon Philippines C\u00f4te d'Ivoire CanadaFemale police of/f_icers 451749 268 138 100 84259 107161131 88 40 36 33 30 25 21 21UN Female Police Officers Top 10 Contributors - June 2009 JUlY 2009 | 1718 | JUl Y 2009In 2000 the United Nations Panel on Peace Oper - ations, under the chairmanship of Lakhtar Brahi- mi, issued its landmark report on improving Unit-ed Nations peacekeeping operations. The Panel called for, inter alia, a \"doctrinal shift\" in the use of police and other rule of law elements to support a greater focus on reform and restructuring activi-ties. The report also recommended adoption of a \"team approach\", whereby adequately resourced police work together with their justice, corrections and other rule of law colleagues in a highly coordi-nated and integrated manner. Seven years later, DPKO's Office of Rule of Law and Security Institutions (OROLSI) was established on the basis of the Brahimi Report and subsequent re-ports of the Secretary-General and General Assembly on the rule of law and security sector reform (SSR). Led by Assistant Secretary-General Dmitry Titov, OROLSI brings together the Department's police, justice, corrections, mine action, SSR and disarma-ment, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) staff under one umbrella to work on these key issues. This has led to improvements in areas of integrat- ed planning, joint assessments and cross-cutting guidance development in peace operations and has helped the department respond to the current unprecedented growth in scale and complexity of United Nations Policing. Today's UN Police are now called upon to carry out a series of complex and sensitive tasks including training national po-lice services to perform the full range of police duties professionally and efficiently, including conducting investigations and carrying out arrests. However, as their work is often compromised by the lack of functioning courts and prisons, it is crucial that the reform of judicial, legal and cor - rectional systems accompanies the reform and re- structuring of police services. To meet these challenges, the UN Police Division will be seeking additional resources, including a new generation of strategic police planners in the Police Division at Headquarters as well as law en-forcement specialists in field operations. The tasks ahead are enormous, but the costs of failure would be even larger. nUnited Nations Policing and the integrated rule of law approach The rapid growth in the number of Formed Police Units (FPUs) deployed in UN peacekeeping mis-sions combined with increasingly complex man-dates has resulted in the need to create a new doctrine for this unique body of police officers.FPUs are rapidly deployable, well equipped and trained to act as a cohesive body capable of re-sponding to a wide range of contingencies. They are self-sufficient, able to operate in 'high-risk' environments and are deployed to accomplish po-Developing a new doctrine for Formed Police UnitsOROLSI Assistant Secretary-General Dmitry Titov.

FPUs were first deployed to Kosovo and Timor Les- te in 1999, where the UN had full responsibility for enforcing the law and dealing with threats to public order. In these volatile situations, the UN also wanted to have a more robust and armed po- lice capacity. From their initial deployment, FPUs quickly became the \"go to\" capacity assigned to deal with challeng- es too large for individual, unarmed police and too small for the military peacekeepers. There are now more then 50 FPUs serving in UN Peacekeeping. Faced with increasingly complex mandates, the UN Police Division required greater clarity on the role and functions of FPUs. In order to build on broad support from Police Contributing Countries from the outset, a Doctrine Development Group (DDG) consisting of 36 participants from 24 coun- tries and five regional organizations, as well as representatives of the Police Advisers Community in New York City, was established.\"The objective of the doctrine development process is to ensure that FPUs are safe and operational,\" said Andrew Carpenter, Chief of the Police Divi-sion's Strategic Policy and Development Section. \"If these units are to fulfil their duties in a UN peacekeeping mission as effectively as possible, a shared approach to the conditions of their de- ployment, their potential role and limitations and composition is essential,\" Mr. Carpenter said. At its first meeting in Vicenza, Italy, in December 2008, the DDG began working towards a com-mon doctrine for FPUs in international peace-keeping operations that would reflect various policing cultures around the world, but would also meet UN standards on human rights and reflect the values for which the UN stands.The DDG examined core tasks and necessary skills, use of force, chain of command, weapons profi- ciency, equipment and logistics. n An Indian all-female Formed Police Unit deployed in Liberia practicing martial arts.

The SPC was established in 2007 to re- spond to the need to provide the UN with a small corps of senior police officers and managers to organize the start-up of po-lice components of peace operations and to undertake urgent mission assessments. The SPC also provides expertise to exist-ing UN peace operations in institutional law enforcement capacity-building. The SPC's first deployment was to the United Nations Mission to the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) from November 2007 to August 2008. The SPC team provided police leader - ship, established police offices, sections and units, assisted in the drafting of key legal documents for MINURCAT and ad-vised the Mission leadership on all issues related to policing. The SPC developed the curriculum for the training of recruits for a specialized police unit in Chad, the D\u00e9tachment Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de Standing Police Capacity: providing start-up and assistance The first graduation ceremony for officers in the new D\u00e9tachment Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de S\u00e9curit\u00e9, N'Djamena, Chad, August 2008.

Most of the refugees have fled the conflict in the neighboring Darfur region of Sudan. An SPC team was also deployed to the United Na- tions Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), from May to July 2008, to assist the mission in reviewing the strategic handover of responsibility to the na- tional police and to select and mentor national police officers. The SPC deployed to the United Nations Mis- sion to Liberia (UNMIL) from September 2008 to March 2009 to assist the Liberian National Police (LNP) with their strategic plan and long term de-velopment program. This was followed by SPC assistance missions to the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Re-public of Congo and the United Nations Stabilisa-tion Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) in March 2009. \"The ability of the Department of Peacekeeping Op- erations to rapidly deploy a start-up police capacity adds an important new element to the United Na-tions ability to initiate a peacekeeping mission, as does the ability to dispatch personnel in response to specific requests for assistance from ongoing mis- sions,\" said SPC Chief Walter Wolf. n Personal Qualities of a UN Police Officer: u Good judgment, supported by a common-sense approach to problem-solving; u Objective attitude, displaying tact and impartiality; u Polite demeanour, combined with a firm but flexible and honest approach; u Considerable self-discipline and patience; u A friendly, open approach to other nationalities and a ready sense of humour; u Ability to influence others, resulting from imagination and persuasiveness; and u Demonstrable leadership skills.

Mandates quickly expand in the early 1990s, ranging from police reform in El Salvador and Mo- zambique to a broad mandate in Cambodia. 1994: 1,677 UN civilian police officers are deployed in peacekeeping missions. 1995: UN Police become an increasingly important element of UN peacekeeping. In Decem- ber, a police component is added as a strategic choice rather than an add-on to military observers, in the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH). Pro-moting the rule of law and reforming police services in conflict areas is recognised as a central tool for helping war-torn societies recover from conflict. 1998: The first Formed Police Unit, the Multinational Specialised Unit (MSU) is deployed to NATO's Stabilisation Force (SFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is the precursor to the Formed Police Units that would later be deployed in United Nations missions. 1999: UN Police deployed to the UN Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) are tasked with the full spectrum of law enforcement for the first time, as well as building a brand new police service. UNMIK includes the first Formed Police Unit in a UN mission, called the Specialised Police Unit (SPU) and, at its peak in 2001, included 3,300 police of-ficers from 50 countries. In cooperation with the Organisation for Security and Coopera-tion in Europe (OSCE), over 8,000 police officers are recruited and trained to form the Kosovo Police Service (KPS). 2000: 5,840 UN Police officers are deployed in peacekeeping missions. 2006: The UN Standing Police Capacity is formally established. More than 8,200 UN Police from 92 countries are deployed in 17 missions globally. 2007: In January, the first all-female Formed Police Unit is deployed from India to the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). In July, 6,400 police officers are authorized for the African Union/ United Nations Hybrid Operations in Darfur (UNAMID), of which 2,936 are deployed by June 2009. In November, the Standing Police Capacity establishes the police component of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT). 2009: 11,000 UN Police officers (8% women) from 100 countries are deployed in 18 missions.History of United Nations Policing UN POLICE MAGAZINE 28 | JUl Y 2009JULY 2009 3rd EditionFemale - 867 (7.8%) Male - 10,218 (92.2%)Gender (Im)Balance the Standing Police Capacity (SPC), Ms. Souad Abbes receiving UN peace medal form Alain Le Roy USG for DPKO.
