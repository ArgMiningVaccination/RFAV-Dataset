He's even got the supermarket sell line sorted - \"VitaChoc: It's choc-full of vitamins!\" \"I would joke around with the sound guy about it,\" the likeable Australian-Canadian physicist and science broadcaster laughs. \"For the young woman thinking of getting pregnant, we'll have chocolate with B9 in it. Our anti-scurvy one would be choc-orange flavoured ... we came up with the whole range.\" The documentary - made for SBS by Melbourne's Genepool Productions and directed by Emmy-winning filmmaker Sonya Pemberton (Jabbed: Love, Fear and Vaccines) - takes aim at our vitamins obsession, and a supplements industry that pulls in about $100 billion a year worldwide, the kind of financial heft that can recruit celebrity spokespeople such as Nicole Kidman to peddle its controversial wares. \"I was seeing products pop up like Vitamin Water, Vitamin Gum, and it kind of drove me a little bit nuts - these companies using the veneer of science to sell products,\" says Muller. \"Growing up, my mum was a big believer in vitamins. If I'm sick with a cold, she'll still recommend I take Vitamin C, even though the science doesn't back that. \"There's all these misperceptions out there that lead to a lot of vitamin use, so a big part of this film is asking people to open their eyes and think about what they're putting into their bodies and what it's actually doing to them.\" Best known as a contributor on ABC's Catalyst and for his viral YouTube channel Veritasium, Muller attacks the topic with scientific scepticism, interrogating the companies' practices in exploiting the ever-booming wellness trend, with their vague claims as to a product's benefits, as well as consumer gullibility in prioritising pills over a proper diet. \"I think what's funny is the difference in approach people have to vitamins than they have to medicines,\" he says. \"A lot of people will talk about 'big pharma' and how awful it is and they're sceptical of all these scientifically validated remedies - which come with side effects, sure, but we know about those side effects and they're clearly listed on the label. \"Meanwhile, they're popping these vitamins thinking they're natural and risk-free when they're really constructed in much the same way, in chemical factories.\" The lack of transparency, coupled with a lack of regulation that means vitamins - even in Australia, where they're at least tested for safety - aren't tested for efficacy, are Muller's main concerns. He describes the industry as a veritable \"wild west\", where misinformation rules. \"There are so many misleading practices,\" he says. \"For example, for bottles to be labelled 'Made in Australia' when none of the raw ingredients actually come from this country. Or for companies to put 'natural' on the label, as though it actually means something. Or to claim certain health benefits as long as they're made in a very limited fashion, like 'promotes digestive health' or 'encourages sleep', and without an actual iota of scientific evidence to back it up. \"I think all of that is worrying, and it's misleading for the consumer.\" Shots of sterile chemical factories contrast sharply with the dripping oranges and sunshine logos plastered on vitamin bottles at a wellness expo. But with the industry framed as a looming behemoth, Muller doesn't land any Michael Moore-style punches in the doco, no bumbling company heads awkwardly defending their product. Is there a reason for that? \"Uh, maybe legal?\" he laughs. \"We approached a lot of vitamin manufacturers to let us into their world and show us what was happening ... some of the bigger companies wanted nothing to do with us. It was not something where we were welcome with open arms, not by the industry.\" He says a scheduled visit to shoot at a Vitamin C factory in Scotland, negotiated over about a year, fell apart at the last minute when the company dithered, \"knowing full well we'd flown all the way from Australia and couldn't muck around our schedule to shoot on another day\". \"It's sort of fascinating,\" he says. \"After making a documentary about uranium and radioactive substances, and being able to go inside nuclear power plants, being able to go inside missile silos, to go down in mines, to see all the parts of the nuclear beast - and yet you ask to get into one vitamins production factory and you can't do it! \"That was a bit of an eye-opener to me,\" he says. \"Why aren't we being more transparent about this? I guess people don't want to spoil the illusion of the vitamin coming straight from your oranges, that purified orange essence,\" he adds sarcastically, \"which it isn't.\" Muller hopes the documentary will help consumers, both vitamin users and sceptics alike, further scrutinise the industry's hype. \"The goal of the film is not to say that all vitamins are rubbish, but just to say, think carefully about why you want to take these and what's in them,\" he says. \"There are definitely times when a vitamin can be a lifesaver, and we point to that in the film ... but if you think that taking a multivitamin a day is going to make up for all your deficiencies in terms of diet, that's just the wrong impression.\" Vitamania: The Sense and Nonsense of Vitamins airs on SBS on August "}
