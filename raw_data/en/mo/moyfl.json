Indian meals rarely qualify on this count.", "sitename": "Economic Times", "date": "2016-07-27", "cleaned_text": "By Saliha Nasline A healthy plate is one that has the right combination of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Indian meals rarely qualify on this count. An Indian meal, in combination with rice or [rotis](/topic/rotis), mostly contains meat or fish for a non-vegetarian, and some vegetables and negligible dal for a vegetarian. In the bargain, proteins almost get a go-by and we end up getting loaded with carbohydrates and fats. \"Protein deficiency is very common in India. It starts at a very young age and is seen at an alarming rate in school-going children. Even adults are not spared. In India, we do not consume even 10% of the protein-rich diets consumed in Western countries,\" said Dr S Manohar, senior consultant, internal medicine, at Sakra World Hospital in Bengaluru. It is a common belief that vegetarians are more prone to protein deficiency as they do not get the goodness of meat, but experts say that non-vegetarians are equally vulnerable to protein deficiency . The main reason among urban Indians and specially the working population is the increasing consumption of fast foods, which have replaced healthy home-cooked food. Another factor is the poor economic conditions people from low-income groups are unable to afford protein rich foods such as pulses, meat, fish, eggs and milk due to their exorbitant prices, Manohar said. Shalini Arvind, chief dietician at Bengaluru's Fortis Hospitals, said, \"Inappropriate eating habits are the main reason for protein deficiency . It is seen that many people just choose low-calorie food that doesn't have enough nutrients and proteins, leading to deficiency of proteins.\" If a person consumes a lesser amount of carbohydrates, the body will be forced to use the protein for energy, she said, whereas protein is actually meant for regulatory and metabolic functions. Protein deficiency impacts the whole body From the hair on our head to the nails on our toes, everything is made up of protein molecules of different types and any protein shortfall in our diet hits the entire body . Protein-deficient children never reach normal adult size and may experience mild mental retardation, digestive problems or [pancreatic disorders](/topic/pancreatic-disorders). A prolonged period of protein deficiency causes the immune system to weaken. As a result, children and adults with protein deficiency succumb more easily to infections, said Dr Priyanka Rohatgi, consultant dietician at Apollo Hospitals in Bengaluru. She said that protein deficiency in India is pretty high, especially in rural areas. Among urban population, it's more among the adolescents and adults. \"Protein plays a vital role in the biological processes in the body . Protein deficiency affects the immune system, height, weight, repair, regeneration and growth of tissues. It also causes fatigue, hair loss, anorexia, constipation, muscle weakness, etc,\" said Manohar. Protein deficiency leads to a wide variety of diseases including renal diseases, malignancy , chronic metabolic disorder, high stress levels, loss of appetite (anorexia), diabetes mellitus, organ failure and hypertension, Manohar said. Such deficiency can lead to loss of muscle mass, skin pigmentation and diarrhoea, changes in the colour or texture of hair, protruding belly, rashes and swelling.People with the deficiency also experience fatigue, lethargy , irritability and apathy , said Rohatgi. How to add proteins So how much of these building blocks does a person require ? According to Manohar, each individual requires 1.5-2 grams of protein per kilogram of his or her body weight.Rohatgi said that every meal should have at least one serving of milk products and one serving of pulses. An in take less than this will lead to difficulty in performing simple tasks and processing sensory signals by the brain. But encouragingly enough, it takes just a little amount of care and improvement in daily dietary habits to overcome protein deficiency . Make sure your diet consists of products such as milk, eggs, meat and fish. Vegetarians would do well to add milk, protein-rich fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, sprouts, cereals, soya, etc, to their diets, Manohar said. A vegetarian diet, he said, is deficient in protein since it lacks eight essential amino acids that are available in non-vegetarian products. Therefore, it is essential for vegetarians to maintain a balanced diet. Rohatgi said that a proper intake of proteins through every meal will reduce the risk of protein deficiency .For vegetarians, the essential sources of proteins are milk and its byproducts, pulses, dal, sprouts, soya and nuts. For others, protein comes from a variety of sources, including chicken, meat, poultry , eggs and fish. Are supplements good? It is a growing trend among fitness enthusiasts to consume artificial protein supplements, often without realising the risk of increase in creatinine levels in the body that can cause renal failure. No artificial protein supplements can equate natural protein-rich foods, Manohar said. It is therefore recommended that only natural protein-rich food substances be consumed instead of the artificial powders and supplements, he added. Proteins and women \"Women are more prone to protein deficiency because of the patriarchal society that we live in. Usually , women consume food after men.Though this seems to be changing with time, this practice is still seen in rural areas,\" said Manohar. \"Males are given preference over females in most households and this affects the nutrition and protein requirements of the latter. Pregnancy and lactation add to the burden,\" he said. An expectant mother should eat a balanced diet for the healthy growth and development of the baby . Protein is one such essential nutrition that every pregnant mother needs because it provides the amino acids needed for adequate bone, cells and muscle development of the child. Protein consumption during pregnancy has also been linked to a lower risk of neonatal death and the occurrence of certain birth defects.
