It is steeped in thousands of years of practice and tradition and as such, takes the whole body, the mind and the spirit into consideration when formulating appropriate diagnostics. Through the use of fine sterile needles, we can decrease systemic inflammation, regulate nitric oxide levels, affect organ function, alleviate pain, restore function, support fertility and immunity, work through trauma, reprogram mood disorders and so much more. Carefully curated traditional Chinese herbal medicine is formulated based on your unique diagnostic presentations and when combined with acupuncture, provide a thorough and effective treatment system.
