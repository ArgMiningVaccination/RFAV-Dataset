The first step would be to [schedule a \"meet & greet\".](https://calendly.com/the-organic-cure) ;) Naturopathic services are definitely holistic by nature! This means we look at the whole person, rather than focusing on just the symptoms. We work closely with our patients to identify the root causes behind symptoms & build long-term health. We accept all major credit cards & Health Savings Accounts (HSA). We don't accept insurance because in doing so, we become restricted in the type of care we can provide. We believe the most ethical way to provide health care is to work directly for YOU. Lab work, however, is typically covered by insurance and we can help you navigate that. Yes! We love data, and that includes bloodwork. Our naturopathic doctors can order both \"normal\" tests, which are often run in conventional settings and specialized tests. Conventional testing is often covered through your insurance, whereas most specialized testing is not. YES, dads are welcome! While we specialize in women's health, we also work with men to address issues within our areas of focus, such as weight loss and digestive concerns. We'd love to chat with you!
