Most of them focus on releasing physical tension from the body. Here, at Tantric Journey, we focus on releasing both physical and emotional toxins from the body cellular memory. Research shows that physical tension is a manifestation of emotional tension due to past negative events. Tantric Journey is at the forefront of innovative Emotional Detox bodywork because it is one of the few schools in the world which offer Emotional release using ancient Tantric-Tao bodywork, integrated into a complete educational curriculum. Consequently, the students can explore all aspects of deeper healing, holistic view of the body, including pelvic healing - unlike any other massage modality. Many other forms of bodywork training out there, do not address the body in this manner, leaving the student confused and frustrated. Tantric Journey uses simple techniques such as Deep bodywork, which incorporates breath, sound and body movement simultaneously to reprogram the body's cellular memory to achieve optimal health and well-being. Most massage modalities focus on the physical symptoms and help to release physical body tension, while at Tantric Journey, we focus on the cause of the symptom and focus on physical body, emotional body and spiritual body, which will then prevent clients to go for regular massages to release tension saving them time and money. IMPORTANT: Requirements: Must not use recreational drugs or alcohol 2 days prior to training and during training workshops. You must be over 21 years.
