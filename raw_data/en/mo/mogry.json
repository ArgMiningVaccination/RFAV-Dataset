Children with a history of 2 or more doses of any Moderna formulation should wait 8 weeks before receiving the updated 2023- 2024 COVID -19 vaccine. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued a universal recommendation for a single dose of an updated 2023 -24 COVID -19 vaccine for all persons age 3 years of age. Children 3 through 4 years of age should complete a multi -dose initial series (2 doses of Moderna vaccine or 3 doses of Pfizer vaccine) with at least one dose of the updated 2023 -2024 COVID -19 vaccine. Children 11 years of age who are moderately or severely immunocompromised IP COVID -19 Vaccine Page 2 of 3 should complete a 3-dose initial series with at least one dose of the updated 2023 - 2024 COVID -19 vaccine and may receive additional doses. Bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vac cines are no longer authorized for use by the FDA. Oregon immunization protocol A. Check the ALERT Immunization Information System (IIS) to determine whether the patient needs this vaccine. If ALERT IIS is unavailable, use available documentation and patient statement. B. Screen client for contraindications and precautions . C. Provide a Vaccine Inf ormation Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers , and answer any questions . D. Record all required data elements in the client's permanent health record. E. Verify needle length for IM injection. F. To avoid injury related to vaccine administration, make sure staff who administer vaccines recognize the anatomic landmarks for identifying the vastus lateralis or deltoid muscle and use proper IM administration technique. G. For Pfizer vaccine onl y: thaw , if needed . The yellow cap formulation require s reconstitution ; the gray and blue cap formulation s are ready to administer.1,5 H. For Moderna vaccine only : thaw , if neede d, prior to administration.2 I. Administer a dose of updated 2023- 2024 Pfizer or Moderna COVID -19 vaccine according to ACIP recommendations and the vaccine package insert. See section 3 for vaccine volume and spacing based on age and vaccine formulation. J. Novavax monovalent vaccine may be used as a first booster in an adult patient only if an FDA -authorized mRNA booster is not accessible or clinically appropriate, or the patient elects to receive the Novavax COVID -19 vaccine because they would otherwise not receive a booster dose of another COVID -19 vaccine.3 K. COVID-19 vaccine s appear to be more reactogenic than most .4 Inform patient that symptoms of immune system activation are normal (see Table) and should improve without intervention in 12- 24 hours. L. Anaphylaxis has been reported after COVID -19 vaccination. Vaccinator must be prepared to respond to a severe allergic reaction. See Section 6 for a list of excipients. IP COVID -19 Vaccine Page 3 of 4 M. Ask patient to remain seated in the clinic for 15 minutes after vaccination to decrease the risk of injury should they faint. Patients with a history of severe allergic reactions should be asked to remain for 30 minutes .4 N. Report all administered COVID -19 doses to ALERT IIS within 72 hours of administration. I have read, understand, and agree to participate by the terms of this protocol. Pharmacist Signature Date Vaccine schedule for COVID -19 Vaccines A.

An updated, 2023- 24 mRNA COVID -19 vaccine dose should be offered to all persons aged 6 months and older. Children 3 years through 4 years of age should complete a multi -dose initial series (2 doses of Moderna vaccine or 3 doses of Pfizer vaccine) with at least one dose of the 2023 -2024 COVID -19 mRNA vaccine s. For adults and children 12 years of age, a protein subunit (Novavax) vaccine may be used. B. Covid -19 vaccines are not interchangeable. When multiple doses are indicated (i.e. in unvaccinated children), the same vaccine brand should be used. In exceptional situations in which an mRNA vaccine series was begun, but the particular product administered for previous doses is not available, the other mRNA Covid -19 vaccine may be administered to complete the primary vaccine series. Doses for persons 5 years of age may be any auth orized product. C. Though not preferred, Novavax vaccine is currently approved as a two- dose primary series and as a first booster dose in certain circumstances , regardless of immunocompetency status. Persons who complete the Novavax series may receive a 2023-24 mRNA dose at least 2 months after their final dose of Novavax . Alternatively, Novavax may be administered as a first booster dose 6 months after completion of a primary series for individuals 18 and older for whom an FDA -authorized mRNA 2023 -2024 vaccine is not accessible or clinically appropriate, or who elect to receive the Novavax COVID -19 vaccine because they would otherwise not receive an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine. A Novavax booster dose is not authorized to follow any prior booster dose.3 IP COVID -19 Vaccine Page 8 of 9 D. Childr en 11 years of age with immune compromise require a 3-dose primary series. All three doses should be the same vaccine brand. At least one dose should be of the 2023- 24 COVID -19 vaccine.1,2 E. For all persons with immune compromise, additional doses of vacci ne may be administered at the discretion of the healthcare provider, based on the individual's clinical circumstances. 4 F. Persons with immune compromise may self -attest to the need for additional doses. No other documentation is necessary. G. Conditions causing moderate to severe immunodeficiency include: o Active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies o Receipt of solid- organ transplant and taking immunosuppressive therapy o Receipt of CAR *-T-cell or hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) within 2 years of transplantation or taking immunosuppression therapy o Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (e.g., DiGeorge, Wiskott - Aldrich syndromes) o Advanced or untreated HIV infection (people with HIV and CD4 cell counts <200/mm3, history of an AIDS -defining illness without immune reconstitution, or clinical manifestations of symptomatic HIV) o Active treatment with high -dose corticosteroids (i.e., 20 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) o alkylating agents, antimetabolites, transplant -related immunosuppressi ve drugs, cancer chemotherapeutic classified as severely immunosuppressive, TNF blockers, and other biologic agents that are immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory. * Chimeric antigen receptor. Added to a patient's T lymphocytes so that they recogniz e and attack cancer cells. Contraindications Severe allergic reaction (e.g. , anaphylaxis) to a previous dose or to any vaccine component.

History of severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to any other vaccine or injectable therapy (e.g. intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous). B. Persons who have a contraindication to addition al doses of mRNA COVID -19 vaccines are considered to have a precaution to the Novavax vaccine. A single dose may be given in an appropriate setting under the supervision of a health care provider experienced in the management of severe allergic reactions. Consider referral to an allergist -immunologist. This additional dose could be considered after a minimum interval of 28 days after the mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine dose. See Appendix A for additional information. C. Moderate or severe acute illness. Other considerations4 A. Patients with known COVID -19 infection should wait until their symptoms have resolved and criteria have been met to discontinue isolation. Persons who have a history of COVID -19 disease should be vaccinated if otherwise indicated. If desired, persons with acute COVID -19 may wait up to 90 days to receive vaccination, as reinfection within 90 days is uncommon. Viral t esting to assess for acute SARS-CoV -2 infection or serologic testing to assess for prior infection solely for the purposes of vaccine decision -making is not recommended. B. Patients who received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma during COVID -19 treatment may be vaccinated as soon as their symptoms have resolved. C. COVID -19 vaccine may be administered concomitantly with other vaccines. D. CDC recommends that vaccine for children aged 5-17 years of age with history of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome of Children (MIS -C) be delayed for 90 days after their diagnosis of MIS -C. Providers should inform patients that the ris k of reinfection , and there fore the potential benefit from vaccination, may increase with time following initial infection. E. COVID -19 vaccination is recommended for all people of childbearing age , including people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future. F. Persons with underlying medical conditions who have no contraindications may (42.5 \u00b5g) and Fraction -C (7.5 \u00b5g) of saponin extracts from the soapbark tree, Quillaja saponaria Molina.
