The focus area of acupuncture is controlling pain and related symptoms. It involves using thin needles by inserting them through the skin at specified points. This therapeutic approach has its roots in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with underpinning philosophies drawn from Confucianism and Taoism. According to Chinese philosophy, good health results from qi, or \"vital energy,\" which encompasses the yin/yang dichotomy that permeates all physical worlds. This exercise describes the physiology and method of action of acupuncture. It also emphasizes the importance of interprofessional healthcare practitioners in assisting patients with pain management education. The needles used in acupuncture are made of stainless steel. They are meant for single use only. Although it sounds complex and tricky, scientific studies and research supports and confirms acupuncture's efficacy for various health conditions. Who is an acupuncturist? An acupuncturist is a trained professional in acupuncture medicine. They are experts and know all about the \"acupoints\" of the human body. Along with maintaining patients' health and wellness, evaluation and treatment of pain and illness are their areas of expertise. Though acupuncturists have excellent command over traditional assessment techniques, they are also adept at using conventional and cutting-edge technologies in their treatments. Acupuncturists treat all types of patients, regardless of their age. Moreover, a good acupuncturist possesses sound judgment and strong interpersonal skills. Also, being composed and patient in any practice scenario is fundamental in their profession. You'll typically find acupuncturists working in their private clinics. However, with today's expanding health care and self-care systems, spas, hospitals, cancer treatment, addiction treatment, sports injury treatment, health and wellness centers, and fertility clinics have also become common practice places for them. Conditions that acupuncturists treat Acupuncture is effective in cases of multiple conditions and symptoms, such as: - Low back pain - With a prevalence of 22% to 48% in the adult population, low back pain is a widespread issue in the United States, says the National Library of Medicine. According to studies, acupuncture treatment enhances functional status and lessens lower back pain. - Osteoarthritis - One study found that acupuncture was just as beneficial as medical therapy and more so than exercises in the case of osteoarthritis. - Migraine - Research suggests that acupuncture can lessen headache intensity and frequency slightly. The National Institute of Health Care Excellence recommended acupuncture for chronic headaches or migraines that did not respond to pharmacological management. Acupuncture may also be beneficial for other conditions. These include neck, face, knee, and muscle pain, headaches, menstrual cramps, sports injuries, nerve discomfort, infertility, immune system issues, irritable bowel syndrome, menopause, pregnancy discomfort, repetitive strain disorders, and overuse syndrome. It is also proven helpful for cancer and cancer treatment side effects and hot flashes. How safe is acupuncture? Acupuncture is generally safe and has few adverse side effects when done by a trained specialist. The FDA governs acupuncture needles in the United States. All needles must comply with the agency's requirements for steel, solidity, sterility, nontoxicity, and correct labeling. Moreover, only licensed specialists can use acupuncture needles. Acupuncture treatments provided by unlicensed professionals may be hazardous. Infections, organ punctures, and damage to the central nervous system may result from inexperienced providers. What happens during an acupuncture session? Your first appointment will begin with the primary step of discussing your condition. The doctor will then look for areas of your body that will respond to acupuncture, followed by the needle insertion technique. The needles used are sterilized and as thin as human hair. Also, they are placed at different depths and may remain in for a short while or up to 20 minutes. Each needle may cause a minor prick to your skin. However, it is less painful than getting a vaccine shot. Compared to medical needles, acupuncture needles are thinner and more solid instead of hollow. Muscle sensations from the needles, such as dull pain or tingling, are possible. Your healthcare provider will expect you to report any instances of extreme heaviness or numbness. Those feelings are typically signs that the technique is working. You will feel a calming sensation at the end of your session, precisely the first one. It is hence ideal for taking a ride home. In case it's not possible, try to take five to ten minutes off before getting behind the wheel. Following each appointment, your acupuncturist might advise you to relax for a day or two.
