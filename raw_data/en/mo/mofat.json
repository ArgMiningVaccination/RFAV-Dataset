The 35-year-old New City native is a chiropractor who grew up in a family opposed to vaccines. And he's embraced the no-vaccines philosophy in his own life. He believes instead in the body's inherent ability to fend off disease. \"(The job of) chiropractic is to allow the body to function optimally without taking anything out or putting anything in,\" he said. As the [measles outbreak ](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/health/2015/01/24/measles-need-know/22244859/)continues to intensify the debate over vaccines, some chiropractors like Handt \u2014 who view a misaligned spine as the cause of many illnesses \u2014 adhere to a belief that the mainstream medical community regards as dangerous. The [American Chiropractic Association's](http://www.acatoday.org/) policy on vaccination is vague at best: It \"acknowledges that the use of vaccines is not without risk\" and \"supports each individual's right to freedom of choice.\" Most chiropractic colleges are not opposed to vaccination, said [Stephen Perle](http://www.bridgeport.edu/faculty-spotlights/stephen-perle/), professor of clinical sciences at the [University of Bridgeport ](http://www.bridgeport.edu/)College of Chiropractic. But a passionate minority of the profession \u2014 about 19 percent, estimates Perle \u2014 are making their voices heard. Chiropractor [David LaRocco](http://www.thegreaterwellbeing.com/about/) posts information on his website and on his Facebook page about the hazards of vaccines. \"We are the only drugless profession that exists,\" said LaRocco, who runs [The Greater Well-Being](http://www.thegreaterwellbeing.com/) in Mamaroneck with his wife, Veronique, also a chiropractor. \"We realize the body is a self-repairing, self-healing organism.\" The couple's three children are not vaccinated. A recent post to LaRocco's website reads: \"Doctors are great people and they truly care, but when was the last time your doctor actually showed you the (package) insert of the chickenpox vaccine?\" When patients ask his opinion of vaccines, LaRocco says he gives them information aimed at helping them make educated choices. Peter Morgan, a chiropractor who lives in Harrison, shares LaRocco's sentiments. \"I'm not so convinced that vaccinations are the answer to diseases,\" he said. \"My belief system is that the skin is the No. 1 part of our immune system, and when you're penetrating the skin with needles, no matter what you're putting in there, it's just not natural.\" While Handt never tells his patients whether to vaccinate, he steers them toward the [National Vaccine Information Center](http://www.nvic.org/), run by anti-vaccine activist [Barbara Loe Fisher](http://www.nvic.org/barbaraspeaksout.aspx), and [Dr. Suzanne Humphries](http://drsuzanne.net/dr-suzanne-humphries-vaccines-vaccination/), a nephrologist who questions the need for vaccines. \"We try to get information with research behind it,\" he said. \"It's not just someone on a blog posting random stuff.\" But Perle, the Bridgeport professor who had a chiropractic practice before he started teaching full time, believes that high vaccination rates and herd immunity have lulled many in the anti-vaccine community into a false sense of security. \"They don't know how dangerous these conditions are,\" he said. \"It gives you this cavalier sort of attitude that measles wasn't so bad, mumps wasn't so bad, whooping cough wasn't so bad, what do we need the drugs for?\" [Dr. Hilary McClafferty,](http://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/about/directors/mcclafferty) chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics section on integrative medicine, said the risks are real. \"The bottom line is that as pediatricians, most of us have seen the very serious diseases that are being vaccinated against,\" she said. \"I would encourage people to [vaccinate their children](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/health/2015/02/08/measles-outbreak-vaccination-rates-meager-schools/23046605/) and to use a very well-trained, board-certified pediatrician or family medicine practitioner for their child's health care.\" According to the federal [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm64e0213a1.htm)121 cases of measles have been reported in 17 states, [including New York](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/health/2015/01/31/student-amtrak-train-westchester-measles/22647511/), and Washington, D.C., mostly among people who were never vaccinated. [Michelle McCoy, ](http://doctorsmccoy.com/)a chiropractor in Jefferson Valley, believes it is not her role to speak to patients about vaccinations. \"I don't make any recommendations, ever,\" said McCoy, whose own two children have been vaccinated. \"I always advise patients, if they have questions, to ask their pediatrician, review the guidelines and do their own research.\" And while chiropractors like Handt remain optimistic that people can boost their immunity the natural way, Perle suspects there will be fewer anti-vaccine chiropractors in the future, as their view becomes harder to defend medically. \"Show me the "}
