Specifically, Respondents seek leave to amend their Answer by the addition of a First Affirmative Defense to read as follows: FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE As and for a first separate, distinct and affirmative defense, Respondents allege that the action of the Federal Trade Commission in filing the Complaint and seeking the Order included therewith substantially burden Respondents' free exercise religion in violation of 42 D.S.C. Section 2000bb-1(a) and (c). This Motion is based on the subjoined Memorandum. of 2 MEMORADUM IN SUPPORT FTC Rule of Practice 3.15 (16 CFR \u00a7 3.15) allows for the amendment of a pleading \"whenever determination ofa controversy on the merits wil be facilitated thereby (and) to avoid prejudicing the public interest and the rights of the parties.\" See 16 CFR \u00a713.5(a)(2). A. The Proposed Amendment Faciltates the Determination of This Controversy and Prevents Prejudice to Respondents. One ofRespondents foremost claims in this proceeding is that the FTC standards governing deceptive and false advertising, as applied to Respondents, substantially burden Respondents' free exercise of religion. See Respondents' Objection and Memorandum in Opposition to Complaint Counsel's Motion to Compel Production of Documents, pp. 13-17. 42 U.S.C. Section 2000bb-1(a) provides that the \"Governent shall not substantially burden a person's free exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability....\" 42 U.S.C. Section 2000bb-1(c) further provides that \"(a) person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation ofthis section may assert that violation as a ... defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a governent.\" See Gonzales v. ~ Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao Do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418,424 (2006). According to 42 U.S.C. Section 2000bb-2(1), the FTC is subject to the provisions of 42 U 2000bb-l in that the FTC is a \"branch, department, agency, (or) instrumentality... ofthe United States.\" According to 42 U.S.C. Section 2000bb-1(c), Respondents - as a party defendant to this case and controversy, having alleged in their first affirmative defense a personal injury fairly traceable to the FTC's unlawful conduct and for which they are likely to be redressed by the 3 requested relief - has standing under Article II of the United States Constitution. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984). Allowing Respondents to invoke the protections of their free exercise of religion under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\") conforms with Congress's statement that one of its purposes is \"to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by governent.\" 42 U.S.C. section 2000bb(b)(2). B. The Proposed Amendment Conforms to the Evidence. religion' means religious exercise, as defined in section 2000cc-5.\" Section 2000cc-5(7)(A) states that \"'religious According to RFRA Section 2000bb-2(4), \"the term 'exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system exercise' includes any exercise of religious belief.\" (Emphasis added). The discovery process in this case has uncovered substantial evidence that the FTC complaint and proposed orders would substantially burden Respondents' \"religious exercise.\" of C. Justice Requires Leave for Granting the Amendment. RFRA's Section 2000bb(a) includes the findings that \"laws 'neutral' toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise,\" and that \"governents should not substantially burden religious exercise without compellng justification.\" Thus, Section 2000bb-(b) anounces that the purpose of2000bb-1 is: (1) \"to restore the compellng interest test set forth in Sherbert v. Verner ... and Wisconsin v. Yoder and religion is substantially burdened,\" and (2) to provide a ... defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by to guarantee its application in all cases where free exercise of governent.\" Otherwise, the constitutional right of free exercise of religion would not be 4 \"secured\" as an \"unalienable right,\" as provided for by the First Amendment guarantee of free religion. See 42 U.S.C. Section 2000bb(a). The FTC may claim that its rules governing false and deceptive advertising are \"neutral,\" exercise of but the application of those rules \"burden (Respondents') religious exercise as surely as laws justice for intended to interfere with religious exercises.\" Thus, it would be in the interest of Respondents to invoke RFRA's Section 2000bb-1(a) and (c) as a defense in this case. D. No Prejudice Wil Result. Citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962), the United States District Court for the Northern District of California observed that \"(i)n the absence of any apparent or declared reason -such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive ... undue prejudice to the opposing party by virte of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. - leave sought should, as the rules require, be 'freely given.''' Reiffen v. Microsoft, 270 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 1159 (N.D. CaL., 2003). Respondents' amendment does not create the need for any additional discovery, nor wil it delay the proceedings. Thus, Complaint Counsel is not prejudiced. To the contrary, Complaint Counsel has been amply forewarned of the religious nature of Respondents' ministry and of their claims of religious freedom based upon the free exercise guarantee of the First Amendment. See, Points and Authorities, e.g., Respondents' Motion to Dismiss and Supporting Memorandum of pp. 1-4, 17-21. As RFRA's Section 2000bb(a) states, Section 2000bb-1 is simply and that guarantee. For the foregoing reasons, Respondents' request that this Motion be granted. specifically designed to secure the full scope of Respectfully submitted February 24,2009. 5 \".~J~ 26828 Maple Valley Suite Maple Valley, W A 98038 Phone: 425-785-9446 Of Counsel: Herbert W.

This Motion is based on the Memorandum below, on the records and fies herein, and on the Sworn Declarations of DCO's counsel supplied herewith. i. Introduction DCO is a religious ministry, organized as such under the laws of Washington State.! The DCO website states that DCO was formed \"as a health and healing ministry in the summer of 1986.\"2 The organizing principle of DCO's ministry is reflected by its very name. Daniel Chapter One is a book from the 1 DCa incorporates herein the details of its ministry and history as a religious organization as described in its companion Motion to Dismiss on Constitutional grounds, which is filed contemporaneously with this Motion. 2dcipages.com/ danielchapterone/index. php ?option=com_content&task=view&id= 57&Itemid=7 6 Bible's Old Testament, the text of which states that proper religious practice includes a natural diet. This principle is reflected throughout DCO's religious and educational communications, which are accessible to DCO followers and constituents via the DCO website and other media. Part of DCO's religious ministry involves the supply of natural dietary supplements. It is these DCO supplements, and DCO's claims about them, that prompt the FTC's Complaint here. In light of the connection between DCO's ministry and its dietary supplements, this case is unlike any to have come before the FTC to date. The FTC's Complaint against DCa contends that DCO has created an \"overall net impression\" that four specific supplements are offered to cure or treat cancer. The FTC Complaint charges that this activity is therefore false and misleading under 15 USC \u00a7 52, and unfair and deceptive under 15 USC \u00a745. DCO disputes the FTC charges as a matter of substance, and based on several Constitutional grounds. However, this Motion is not about the substantive controversy involved in the FTC's charges. There are no issues of material fact relevant to the legal issue raised in this Motion. By this Motion, DCO wil show that the FTC's charges must be dismissed due to the FTC's inabilty at this stage of the proceedings to meet its evidentiary burden of proof. There can be no factual dispute. Discovery is now closed, and the record reveals that the FTC has ignored or otherwse failed to produce the evidence required to prove essential elements of the statutory charges against DCO. Instead, the FTC has relied almost exclusively on presumptions. A 2 defendant/respondent is entitled to summary judgment when it can show the plaintiff/prosecution lacks the necessary evidence to sustain its burden at triaL. Such is the case here. II. Analysis of the DCO Mosaic In the present case, the FTC's Complaint is based on charges that DCO has created an \"overall net impression\" of cancer cures via its website. 3 The FTC does not contend that DCO has made express claims of cancer cures. FTC case law, guidelines and policy statements have stated clearly over the years that when allegations of deception are based on the \"overall net impression,\" the entire framework and context of the representations must be considered, along with other important factors. \"It is necessary in these cases to consider the advertisement in its entirety, and not to engage in disputatious dissection. The entire mosaic should be viewed rather than each tile separately.\" FTC v. Sterling Drug, 317 F. 2d. 669, 674 (2nd Cir. 1963). To evaluate the DCO mosaic, it is important to know two things: first, what the FTC's Complaint omits about DCO claims; and second, what the FTC's Complaint misrepresents about DCO claims. A. What the Complaint Omits 3 See FTC Answers to DCa Interrogatories # i and 3 through 10, attached as Exhibit A to the McCormack Declaration. 3 The FTC Complaint is based on DCO representations that appear in the DCO website and other media. The DCO representations on which the FTC relies are contained in the Exhibits attached to the Complaint.4 FTC investigators and legal staff discovered DCO by means of an \"internet surf' (i.e., go ogle search) that targeted DCO along with over a hundred other dietary supplement manufacturers.s The investigators who designed the surf, who targeted DCO and who researched DCO's claims had no background in health care.6 The FTC administrator who instigated this particular web surf testified that the decision to pursue the DCO Complaint was based on \"common sense\" and FTC policy. 7 The FTC's only disclosed expert did not review this case until after the Complaint in this matter was filed.8 The FTC's myopic pursuit of DCO resulted in at least two errors in the DCO Complaint. The first of these errors is an error of omission, i.e. what the FTC Complaint leaves out about DCO's website. The second error is one of commission, i.e. what the FTC misrepresents about the DCO website and other materials. In the first instance, the FTC has omitted several indisputable features from the mosaic that is DCO and its claims. The first omission is the name Daniel Chapter One itself, a book of the Old Testament. The following comes from the DCO website: 4 See FTC Answers to DCa Interrogatories 1 at Exhibit A to McCormack Declaration. S Lynne Colbert Dep, at _' Exhibit B to Dep, at _; Richard Cleland Dep, at _, to McCormack 7 Dep at _' 8 See Miler Dep at _, in which he testified that his source for review of Dca alleged claims was the Complaint itself. Exhibit D to McCormack Declaration. 4 Welcome to Daniel Chapter One Online! Daniel Chapter One got its name from the Old Testament, book of Daniel, first chapter. In that account, Daniel and his men were being held in Babylonian captivity, and were expected to eat the king's food -so as to be fit and strong servants. But Daniel asked permission to eat a vegetable diet and to drink only water, rather than partake of the rich meats and wine of the king. The king's men said no; surely Daniel would get sick, maybe die! So Daniel asked for a trial of 10 days. At the end of Chapter One, it is recorded that Daniel and men, after that trial, were strong in flesh, with bright eyes, and continued to grow in knowledge and wisdom. So it was that the founders of Daniel Chapter One(g, since tryng their own \"Daniel Chapter One\" diet for 10 days and discovering that indeed they felt fantastic, decided to name the health food store they began, after that portion of the bible. The company, then and now, does not push a vegetarian diet for wellness, but simply a healthy diet of wholesome, natural foods - rather than the unwholesome, artificial food of the modern world. It's about eating with purpose, and partaking of the good food God has given us for health and healing. Good food for physical, mental, and emotional health includes herbs and nutrients. The tiny health food supplement store Daniel Chapter One(g grew and grew, from one to several locations. As the store grew, so the founders grew - in knowledge and wisdom, as in fact Daniel had experienced! The store quickly became more of a natural healing center. From their hands-on expertise, the couple began next to design the nutritional supplement product line now known world over as Daniel Chapter One.9 Every page of the DCO website contains the following statement: The information on this website is intended to provide information, record, and testimony about God and His Creation. It is not intended to diagnose a disease. The information provided on this site is designed to support, not replace, the relationship that exists between a patient/site visitor and his/her health care provider. Caution: some herbs or supplements should not be mixed with certain medications. The description of every product offered on the DCO website includes the following language: *These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease. (Italics and \"*,, supplied in origina1.)io option, com_ virtuemart/Itemid,44/ 5 3 From this more complete picture of the DCO mosaic, it cannot reasonably be disputed that the DCO ministry - including but not limited to its product offerings - is directed to a unique religious constituency. This indisputable fact bears on the burden of proof that the FTC is required to meet. B. What the Complaint Misrepresents The FTC Complaint also contains errors of commission, i.e. what the Complaint misrepresents. The Complaint identifies DCO representations about 4 DCO products: (1) Bioshark; (2) 7 Herb Formula; (3) GDU; and (4) BioMixx. At ~18 of the Complaint, the FTC sets forth the representations attributed to DCO for each product. The following chart juxtaposes what the FTC attributes to DCO with what DCO actually wrote on its website. This juxtaposition is important not only to a fair evaluation of DCO's \"structure/function\" claims and the substantiation for those claims, but also to an understanding of the \"overall net impression\" that the FTC must now prove with substantial evidence consistent with the required standards of proof. The FTC's attribution to DCO DCO's actual claim About Bioshark: \"Bioshark is pure skeletal tissue of \"Bioshark inhibits tumor growth\" sharks which provides a protein that inhibits angiogenesis -- the formation \"Bioshark is effective in the treatment of new blood vessels. This can stop of cancer\" tumor growth and halt the progression of eye diseases. . . \" About 7 Herb Formula: \"purifes the blood, promotes cell \"7 Herb Formula is effective in repair, fights tumor formation, andtreating and curing cancer\" fights pathoQenic bacteria\" 6 \"7 \"GDU eliminates tumors\" About BioMixx: in the treatment of cancer\" \"BioMix heals the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy\" \"contains natural proteolytic enzymes (fom pineapple source bromelain to help digest protein --even that of unwanted tumors and cysts. This formula also helps to relieve pain and heal infammation. . .GDU is also used for. . .and as an adjunct to cancer therapy. GDU possesses a wide range of actions including anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic activity. . .\" \"boosts the immune system, cleanses the blood andfeeds the endocrine system to allow for natural healing. It is used to assist the body in fig hting cancer and in healing the destructive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments. \" Each of the statements that DCO actually made about its products is truthful and substantiated, as explained in more detail below. In contrast, the FTC has no qualified proof to the contrary that will support its charge of \"overall . .\" net impression. III. Basis and Standard for Summary Decision It bears emphasizing that this Motion for Summary Decision is based on the FTC's lack of competent, qualified evidence altogether, notwithstanding some potential factual issues that are not relevant to this Motion. To survve this Motion, the FTC must offer sufficient qualified evidence, not mere allegations. A \"scintila\" of evidence, evidence that is \"merely colorable\", and evidence that \"is 7 not significantly probative\" will not defeat the motion. See e.g. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242 (1986). It is also true, according to the elements of proof described below, that presumptions about the facts will not defeat this Motion. This Brief shows that the FTC does not have the evidence to meet its burden in this case under the preponderance of evidence standard. Nevertheless, DCO contends that the standard of proof required of the FTC in this case is clear, cogent and convincing evidence in light of the Constitutional libert and propert interests involved in this case. See e.g. Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418 (1970). This standard applies even in the summary judgment context, i.e. the FTC must produce clear, cogent & convincing evidence to defeat DCO's Motion. See Anderson. Addington articulated the reasons for the clear, cogent & convincing standard in a case like this one. Though that case concerned the standard of proof in an involuntary civil commitment proceeding, the Addington Court's analysis properly fits the circumstances here. For instance, Addington states that the nature and importance of the Constitutional interest determines the proper standard of proof. In this case, the Constitutional interests include the First Amendment rights to free speech and religious freedom possessed by both DCO and its constituents. Addington states that proper standard of proof flows from the relative importance attached to the ultimate decision, i.e., the more important the decision, the higher the burden of proof. Id. at 423. Addington established that there is a constitutional necessity for an intermediate standard of proof (i.e., 8 \"clear,\" \"cogent,\" \"unequivocal,\" and/or \"convincing\") in circumstances where the interest is greater than a mere money judgment but less than a generic criminal proceeding. \u00a1d. at 424. The intermediate clear, cogent & convincing standard is required in a variety of civil situations \"to protect particularly important individual interests,\" namely Constitutional interests that are more important than the interest against erroneous imposition of a mere money judgment. Id. Addington also noted that while the interest of the individual may dictate a higher standard of proof to avoid erroneous deprivation, important interests of the state are likewise vindicated by the higher burden because state interests would be compromised by a lower burden of proof, thus needlessly increasing the incidents of erroneous results. Addington, at 425. Indeed, it is not just DCO's constitutional interests that are at stake. Also involved here is the interest of the public, constituents of DCO's ministry who exercise their right to access DCO's religious and educational messages, and the related wellness products and information. The public's interest is as much a part of this case as is DCO's interest. In any event, now that discovery has closed, DCO contends that the FTC charges are wholly unsupported by the required evidence as a matter of law, even if this Court applies a preponderance standard. IV. The Law Requires the FfC to Produce Extrinsic Evidence There are a number of factors that bear on the FTC's burden of proof, and the elements of that proof required in a case like this one. First, in evaluating the FTC charges under 15 USC \u00a7\u00a7 45 and 52, the Commission employs a \"reasonable 9 basis\" test for evaluating whether claims about Challenged Products are unfair, deceptive and/or misleading. See, e.g. FTC v. Pharmatec, 576 F. Supp. 294 (D.C.D.C. 1983); accord, FTC Policy Statement appended to Thompsonll. This test requires the FTC to consider whether there is a \"reasonable basis\" for the claims, i.e. is there reliable and competent information to substantiate the efficacy claims made for the Products. Thompson, 791 F. 2d at 193-194. The FTC must also address several other considerations in order to prove violations of \u00a7\u00a745 and 52. For instance, where the charges against a respondent are based on the \"overall net impression\" rather than on any express claims, those charges must be proved by substantial evidence of consumer expectations in order for the FTC to prevaiL. Thompson, 791 F. 2d at 197. Accord, Thompson Policy Statement at p. 2. Absent actual evidence of consumer expectations, according to the Thompson Policy Statement, the FTC's substantial evidence must address the following 6 factors: \u00b7 The tye of claim; \u00b7 The Products; \u00b7 The consequences of a false claim; \u00b7 The benefits of a truthful claim; \u00b7 The cost of developing substantiation for the claim; and \u00b7 The amount of substantiation experts in the field believe is reasonable. See Thompson Policy Statement at p. 2. The Thompson Policy Statement states clearly that these factors apply to charges of false/misleading advertising, deception and unfairness. \"The what constitutes a reasonable basis depends, as it Commission's determination of 11 Thompson Medical, 104 FTC 648 (1984), affd 791 F. 2d 189 (D.C Cir 1986). 10 does in an unfairness analysis, on a number of factors relevant to the benefits and costs of substantiating a particular claim. These factors include (the list described above.)\" These factors are identical to the statutory requirements of 15 USC 6\u00a745(n) applicable to claims of unfairness. In other words, the FTC must effectively meet the same standards of proof for false advertising and deception, as \u00a745(n) requires for unfairness. The Thompson Policy Statement goes on to say that \"extrinsic evidence\" is useful, including qualified expert testimony and consumer surveys. In fact, under 15 USC \u00a745(n), extrinsic evidence is required. Presumptions and policy guidance alone will not suffice. The Courts and the Commission have explained why extrinsic evidence about these factors is required in a case like this one. For instance, at the outset, evaluation of the 6 factors in an \"overall net impression\" case involves a \"highly factual inquiry. \"12 One reason for that inquiry is because even the most orthodox commercial advertisers \"are not required to substantiate claims that were not made.\" Thompson Policy Statement at footnote #3. Only a \"highly factual inquiry\" can justify overall net impression claims. A. Extrinsic Evidence is Required to Prove Deception and Unfairness. As an adjunct to the required evidence that bears on the 6 factors of the Thompson Policy Statement, the FTC must also examine the allegedly deceptive practice from the perspective of a reasonable consumer. If the representation is 12 Beneficial Corp. v. FTC, 542 F.2d 611, 617 (3rd Cir. 1976). 11 directed primarily to a particular group, the FTC is required to examine reasonableness from the perspective of that group.I3 See FTC Policy Statement appended to Clifdale Associates14 (hereinafter Clifdale Statement). That is, the FTC must determine the effect of the challenged claims on a reasonable member of the target group, e.g. constituents of a religious ministry devoted to natural health and wellness.I5 When such a specific group of recipients is involved, extrinsic evidence about that group's reasonable perceptions is necessary. Id. See e.g. Thompson, 791 F. 2d at 197, where the Circuit Court made special note that \"The issue of the claims) was extensively addressed by expert testimony.\" This is just one of the reasons why understanding the full mosaic of Dca as a religious ministry is so important, because it underscores the requirement for actual extrinsic evidence. (consumer perception of The FTC understands why it's necessary to prove consumer perception with actual extrinsic evidence: \"(Consumer perception scores) may reflect basic consumer skepticism of promotional claims, however worded.\"16 \"Although some variations in consumer interpretation of qualified health claims is inevitable given what are almost certainly broad differences in (consumers') background beliefs, the degree of variation observed in the research is nonetheless surprising. . .\"17 13 Note that the representation need not be directed exclusively to a particular group. 14 See FTC Statement on Deception, appended to Clifdale Associates, 103 FTC 110, 174 (1984), hereinafter Clifdale Statement. 15 See Clifdale Statement at footnotes 13 and 29. 16 See p. In the Matter of Assessing Consumer Perceptions of Health Claims, FTC Staff Comments, p. 10. Complaint Counsel produced this document as indicative of FTC policy bearing on this matter under Bates document nos. FlC- Dca 870 to 894. See Appendix 1 attached hereto. 17 Id, at footnote 39. 12 These statements reveal an understanding that consumer perceptions vary greatly, and in surprising ways. Presumptions about consumer perception do not pass muster under the standards of the Thompson and Clifdale Policy Statements, just as they do not pass muster under \u00a745(n). The FTC must produce substantial evidence about consumer perception, and the 6 factors articulated by the Thompson and Clifdale Policy Statements. This requirement is in accord with, as well as independent from \u00a74s(n). B. Qualified Expert Evidence is Required to Challenge Substantiation. Qualified expert testimony or other extrinsic evidence is required not just to satisfy the FTC's burden on the issue of consumer perception. Qualified expert testimony is also required to address the substantiation for \"overall net impression\" claims. This is especially true for cases involving natural dietary supplements, where science and law has prompted standards for dietary supplement claims that are dramatically different from the standards applied to drugs. As a general matter, the FTC's Official Guidance to the Dietary Supplement Industry says that the amount and tye of substantiation evidence required for dietary supplements is determined by what experts In the relevant field would consider to be adequate. 18 This is consistent with the qualifications 19 required of an expert under the relevancy prong of the Daubert standard. 18 Dietary Supplements: An Advertising Guide for the Industry, produced by Complaint Counsel as evidence of policy in this case. A copy is provided at Appendix 2, Bates no. FlC- DCa lO41 to lO70. See p. lO52, specifically. 19 Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579 (1993). 13 In other words, without testimony from experts who are specifically qualified about dietary supplements (e.g. naturopaths and phyto-nutritionists), the FTC cannot meet its burden of proof about DCO's claims and the alleged lack law. of substantiation for those claims as a matter of 1. DCO's Structure/Function Claims are Not the Same as Health Claims for Drugs. The FTC's need for expert testimony from the field of dietary supplements is drawn from the sharp distinction expressed by Congress between the regulation of dietary supplements claims on the one hand, and the regulation of drugs and drug claims on the other hand. Few, if any, FTC cases have addressed this distinction, as this case now must. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) authorizes dietary supplement manufacturers to make \"structure/function\" claims about their products: (A) statement for a dietary supplement may be made if: (A) the statement claims a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease and discloses the prevalence of such disease in the United States, describes the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to afect the structure or fuction in humans, characterizes the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, or describes general well-being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient, (B) the manufacturer of the dietary supplement has substantiation that such statement is truthful and not misleading, and (C) the statement contains, prominently displayed and in boldface tye, the following: \"This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\". A statement under this subparagraph may not claim to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent a specific disease or class of diseases. 14 See 21 USC \u00a7343(r)(6). (Bold emphasis added.) The meaning of this statute is well settled: a natural supplement provider is lawfully allowed to make structure-function claims describing how a particular nutrient or dietary supplement may affect a structure or function of the human body. See Pearson v. Shalala, 164 F. 3d 650 (1999); and U.S. v. Lane Labs, 324 F. Supp. 2d 547,565 (2004). A fair reading of the actual DCO claims, as opposed to the inferences drawn by the FTC Complaint, shows that DCO claims are proper structure/function claims. Nowhere on the face of the actual DCO statements does DCO state that its products \"diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent a specific disease or class of diseases,\" which are the claims prohibited by DSHEA. Each of the DCO statements on their face describe how the products and/or their constituent ingredients support the structure/function of the human body, as \"adjuncts\" to - not in lieu of - cancer treatment. The efficacy of these DCO claims is corroborated by DCO's experts qualified in natural healing modalities, as discussed below. It is well settled, and self-evident, that FTC law corresponds with DSHEA. Logic dictates that DSHEA influences FTC actions just as significantly as it does FDA actions. Lest there be any doubt as to the role DSHEA must play on FTC law, the FTC's own words put the issue to rest: \"(S)tructurejfunction claims. . . refer to representations about a dietary supplement's effect on the structure or function of the body for maintenance of good health. . . This (FDA) requirement is fully consistent with the FTC's standard that advertising claims be truthful, not misleading and substantiated.\"20 20 FTC Dietary Supplement Advertising Guide, footnotes 2 and 3; Bates page FfC- DCa 1068. 15 In light of DSHEA, it stands to reason that expertise on health claims for drugs is not the same field as expertise on structure/function claims for dietary supplements. Without expert testimony properly qualified for dietary supplements, the FTC does not meet its burden of proof. To summarize this section, the FTC must address the 6 factors identified by the Thompson Policy Statement. It must do so with substantial evidence. These factors apply to FTC charges of deception, just as they apply to charges of unfairness. These factors mirror the requirements of IS USC \u00a74s(n). As part of this inquiry, the FTC must also produce extrinsic evidence bearing on these factors especially when the charges are based on the \"overall net impression,\" as opposed to express claims. The required extrinsic evidence must address the perceptions of a reasonable person within the target audience to whom the Respondent's activity is primarily directed. And the extrinsic evidence must include qualified expert testimony about dietary supplements, about the structure/function claims made for those dietary supplements, and about the substantiation that supports those claims. The record of discovery taken in this case reveals that the FTC has not met any of these requirements. v. The FTC Lacks the Evidence to Sustain the Charges. The FTC has properly identified only three witnesses in this case. Two of those are FTC investigators who are identified as fact witnesses. The third witness is an expert witness qualified in the area of conventional cancer treatment and 16 research. As revealed by their testimony, as well as the testimony of the FTC administrator who conceived of the internet surf that resulted in this action, the FTC has failed to address the required elements of proof in almost every instance. A. The FTC did not consider the required elements of proof. 1. FTC witness Michael Marino is an investigator whose role was limited to gathering evidence: he \"recorded\" the DCO website; he made an undercover website purchase of DCO products; he purchased recordings of two radio programs, and he did BBB, Lexis and Dunn & Bradstreet searches for DCO.21 Mr. Marino had virtually no experience that he could recall investigating dietary supplement manufacturers before this DCO matter.22 He played no role in the evaluation of DCO claims, and exercised no discretion about the investigation. That is, he did what he was told to do.23 Mr. Marino has no training in health matters, and no understanding of what a structure/function claim is.24 He has no understanding of what is meant by \"overall net impression.\"25 He investigated, but could not find any complaints about DCO products.26 He has no knowledge about any consumer injury connected with DCa or its products.27 2. FTC witness Lynne Colbert was the supervsing investigator for the internet surf involved here; her role includes supervsion of FTC staff paralegals 21 See Deposition of Michael Marino, at p20:lIne 5-7; 34: 1-5; 37:8-10 and 38:19-25.

Richard Cleland is the Assistant Director for the Division of Advertising Practice at the FTC.40 He testified for the FTC in this case as a designee on FTC policies and procedures. Mr. Cleland supervsed the internet involved here, and he was the one who titled it \"Operation False Cures.\"41 He surf participated in the exercise of prose cut oria 1 discretion in this case.42 Mr. Cleland testified that it is within the FTC's discretion to evaluate implied claims based on policy and case law; the Commission on its own determines the perspective of a reasonable consumer, and the target audience is presumed from the face of the ad alone.43 Mr. Cleland testified that he FTC conducted its \"reasonable basis\" analysis on the basis of presumptions about consumer perceptions and consumer harm; he testified that those presumptions are based on common sense and general FTC institutional knowledge.44 Mr. Cleland has no knowledge of economic or physical injury that resulted from DCO activity, and the FTC made no effort to evaluate the users of DCO productS.45 The FTC conducted no analysis under 15 USC \u00a745(n) about whether there were benefits to users of the DCO products, nor did the FTC conduct any 38 Id. 42:2-43:6 39 Id. 40:13-22 4\u00b0 Cleland Deposition, at p. 10, line 23 to page 11:line 2. Exhibit C to McCormack Declaration. 41Id. 11:9-19; Id. 70:19-71:12. 45 61:5-23; 67:17-68:7 19 analysis about the costs of substantiating dietary supplements.46 He testified that the FTC used an expert in the field of cancer treatment to evaluate the DCO claims in this case.47 4. Dr. Denis Miler is the FTC's testifyng expert. Dr. Miler's credentials as a cancer researcher for large pharmaceutical companies, and as a professional expert witness, are impressive. See Exhibit H to the McCormack Declaration. Dr. Miler conducted his analysis on the basis of the FTC's version of the implied claims, not on the basis of DCO's structure/function claims. See Exhibit H, P.4 and see e.g. Miler Deposition, p. 97:7-24, Exhibit D to McCormack Declaration. To be more specific, Dr. Miler only evaluated substantiation for whether DCO products \"treat, cure and prevent cancer,\" and not the actual Dca claims themselves. Exhibit H, \u00a7IVat p. 7. See also, e.g. Miler Dep, 142:15-25. Dr. Miler has no training or certification in nutrition. His credentials are in oncology and hematology.48 The sum of this testimony shows that the FTC has brought the charges against DCO based on presumptions, and erroneous presumptions at that. These presumptions include: \u00b7 A presumption that DCO was not authorized to make structure/function claims; \u00b7 A presumption that DCO's claims were directed to the general population, rather than a specific constituency related to its ministry; \u00b7 A presumption that the DCO constituency was deceived by DCO structure/function claims; 46 Id. 72:16-27; 85:20-86:3 47 Id. 86:17-87:2 48 Miler Dep, 14:18-25. 20 \u00b7 A presumption that DCO products offered no benefits; \u00b7 A presumption that DCO had no substantiation for its structure/function claims; \u00b7 A presumption that the substantiation required for dietary supplements is equivalent to the substantiation required for prescription drugs. Reliance on these presumptions does not meet the FTC's burden of proof required by the applicable statutes, guides and policy statements. Yet, the FTC has no other evidence to offer other than these presumptions. As a matter of law, the FTC's charges must be dismissed. B. DCQ's substantiation is more than adequate to meet the required legal standards. Lest this Court be left with concern that the FTC's failngs will allow a miscreant to walk free, Dca has substantiated its structure/function claims. And it has done so more than adequately. DCO supplied considerable substantiating documents to the FTC in discovery. Experts highly qualified in naturopathy and phyto-nutrition considered this substantiation, as well as additional confirming research, which allowed them to conclude that DCO's claims were proper and accurate structure/function claims. By way of example, DCO expert witness Dr. Sally LaMont is a licensed naturopath and acupuncture practitioner. Her expertise includes the use of natural dietary supplements for healing and wellness. Dr. LaMont, who has testified before the California State Legislature in support of naturopathic 21 licensing and efficacy, has issued a written opinion in this case, stating that DCO's actual claims are accurate and substantiated by competent evidence.49 DCO expert witness Dr. Jim Duke is a world-renowned ethnobotanist who has written and lectured extensively on the medicinal qualities of plants and herbs. Dr. Duke co-authored the book Herbs of the Bible: 2000 Years of Plant Medicine.so Dr. Duke worked for 30 years at the USDA, where he established the USDA's ethnobotanical and phytochemical data base. Like Dr. LaMont, Dr. Duke is qualified about the qualities and effects on structure and function of natural products like those used in DCO products. Dr. Duke has also issued a written opinion in this case, stating that DCO's actual claims are accurate and substantiated by competent evidence.s1 VI. In the Absence of Actual Harm. the FfC must prove its case with Actual Evidence or otherwise Violate Due Process. There is a final point to be made about the FTC's flawed reliance on presumptions in a case involving dietary supplement structure/function claims. The principle of DSHEA is that dietary supplements are presumed safe unless and until they are proved harmfuL. The burden to prove harm is on the government. The FTC's approach in this case turns Congressional promulgation of DSHEA on its head by emasculating the dietary supplement providers' rights, and by ignoring the government's burden to prove harm. Even without DSHEA, the FTC's near-exclusive reliance on presumptions in a case like this violates due process. It bears repeating: there are many factors 49 See LaMont Report, p. 40, attached to McCormack Declaration as Exhibit F. 50 Duke & Telatnik, Herbs afthe Bible: 2000 Years afPlant Medicine Interweave Press, 1999. 51 See Duke Report, \u00a7IV at p. 3, and \u00a7VI at p. 13, attached to McCormack Declaration as Exhibit G. 22 that the FTC must consider in order to maintain charges of unfair, deceptive and misleading advertising. In circumstances like those presented here, those factors must be addressed with extrinsic evidence, including but not limited consumer surveys, expert testimony about consumer perceptions and expert testimony qualified in the specific field of dietary supplements. Without such extrinsic evidence, in the absence of actual harm and in the context of an \"overall net impression\" case, the abilty of the FTC to meet nearly every element of proof by means of presumption effectively shifts the burden of proof to the Respondent DCO. This tye of procedural approach absolves the government of the most basic obligation to put on a prima facie case with competent evidence. This is unconstitutional, as it violates due process in the most fundamental of ways. In Mathews v. Eldridge52, the U.S. Supreme Court developed a three-part test to evaluate the minimum constitutional process due in a variety of procedural situations. In Mathews at p. 335, the Court considered whether a hearing prior to administrative termination of social security benefits was constitutionally required. The Court structured its consideration of procedural due process on three relevant factors: (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action; (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used; and (3) the governmental interest in the added fiscal and administrative burden that additional process would entaiL. DCO's companion Motion amply addresses the constitutionally protected First Amendment and Religious interests and deprivations involved in this case. 52424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976) 23 For the purpose of this Motion, the third of the Mathews factors deserves an especially close look, i.e. the added fiscal and administrative burden that additional due process procedures would entail, i.e. the requirement to produce extrinsic evidence instead of presumptions. Mindful of the pages of FTC policy statements and guidelines that are devoted to First Amendment protections and the risk of deprivation, it is this third factor that especially drives the FTC to adopt \"trial by presumption.\" Trial by presumption has been explicitly considered and explicitly rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. Indeed, almost in anticipation of this 3rd element of the Mathews test, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Stanley v. Illinois53 just a few years earlier than Mathews. The Stanley case concerned the due process requirements involved in parentage cases. The Court there addressed the specific question of whether the State could forego due process requirements in the interest of efficiency by adopting a presumption in lieu of meeting a burden of proof. Here, in a quote that seems to have anticipated not only Mathews but this case also, the Stanley court said this: The establishment of prompt efficacious procedures to achieve legitimate state ends is a proper state interest worthy of cognizance in constitutional adjudication. But the Constitution recognizes higher values than speed and efficiency. Indeed, one might fairly say of the Bil of Rights in general, and the Due Process Clause in particular, that they were designed to protect the fragile values of a vulnerable citizenry from the overbearing concern for efficiency and efficacy that may characterize praiseworthy government officials no less, and perhaps more, than mediocre ones. 53405 U.S. 645, 656-657 (1972). 24 Procedure by presumption is always cheaper and easier than individualized determination. But when, as here, the procedure forecloses the determinative issues. . . when it explicitly disdains present realities in deference to past formalities, it needlessly risks running roughshod over the important interests. . . (Such a procedure) therefore cannot stand. Allowing the FTC to try this case by presumption in the absence of actual harm, wherein the standard is a subjective \"overall net impression,\" improperly shifts the primary burden of proof to DCO in violation of DSHEA, Matthews and Stanley. A. Adjudication by presumption is the unauthorized use of parens patriae under the guise of police power. The FTC uses its police power to protect citizens from harm and the unreasonable risk of harm. A similar power is conferred on a government agency as parens patriae - government as parent - to determine what is good and healthy for citizens who are deemed unfit to care for themselves. See e.g. Addington. When a government agency exploit its police power in the absence of harm, and in the absence of authentic, qualified and credible extrinsic evidence, that agency casts itself not as the arbiter of what is harmful, but as the arbiter of what is good and healthy. It casts itself as the parens patriae of healthcare for all citizens. Nothing could be more systemically damaging and offensive, much less unconstitutional, to the burgeoning and valuable healthy effects offered by dietary supplements to consumers, to say nothing of the actual users of DCO products who benefited from their faith in DCO when they were left with nowhere else to turn. 25 CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Motion to Dismiss should be granted and the Complaint dismissed.

For all statements identified in your response to Interrogatory #9, state the injures that the alleged have been caused, or are likely to be caused, to consumers as a result of Respondents. ANSWER: Subject to Complaint Counsel's previously stated objections, although injures have been practices or acts of the alleged practices or acts of caused, or are likely to be caused, to consumers as a result of Respondents, proving specific injur is not a necessar element of the proof in this litigation. Consumer injury is inherent when products are promoted for the- cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases or other health-related benefits through false, misleading, or deceptive representations. To that extent that such injur can be quantified in terms of economic har consumers have suffered, Respondents possess information setting forth Respondents' total revenue from the sale of products with false, misleading, or deceptive representations. 12. For all statements identified in your response to Interrogatory #9, identify the steps you have taken to determine whether or not the alleged injuries are reasonably avoidable by consumers. 8 consumers would not have less access to information about traditional use of natural remedies without information that comes from claims by supplement manufacturers about the traditional use of natural remedies, including dietary supplements. ANSWER: Subject to Complaint Counsel's previously stated objections, Complaint Counsel respond as follows: claims that are false, misleading, or lack substantiation do not provide any useful information to consumers, as set forth in the public policies expressed by Congress in Sections the FTC Act, the FTC Policy Statement on Deception, the FTC Policy Statement Regarding Advertising Substantiation, the FTC Food Policy Statement, the FTC Policy 5(a) and 12 of Statement on Unfairness, the FTC Guides Concernng Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, and in relevant case law. 24 Dated: Januar 5,2009 Respectfully submitted, ~anl\u00a1212) 607-2816 607-2813 David W.

COLBERT a witness, called for examination, having been first duly swotn, was examined and testified as follows: EXAMINA TION BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Good afternoon, Ms. Colbert. A. Yes. Q.

Lynn, L-Y-N-N-E, middle initial J, Colbert, C-O-L-B-E-R-T, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Northwest, Mail Drop NJ-3212, Washington, D.C. 20580. Q. Ms. Colbert, have you ever had your deposition taken before? A. Yes, I have. Q. How many times roughly? A. Roughly two or three times. Q. Okay. And do you recall the most recent time? A. No, I don't. It was approximately two years ago i believe. 1 (Pages 1 to 4) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 1/22/2009 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Colbert 5 1 Q. Okay. The other instances when you've had your 1 2 deposition taken, were they -- did you testify as an FTC 2 3 witness or employee of some sort as opposed to a 3 4 personal matter? 4 5 A. As an FTC employee. 5 6 Q. Do you remember the nature of the cases in which 6 7 you testifed? 7 8 A. One was a dietary supplement case. 8 9 And one was a device, but 1 was really a 9 10 peripheral player in that. 10 11 1 i Q. In the device case? 12 A. Yes. 12 13 Q. Okay. Generally let me just refresh your memory 13 14 perhaps to the extent it's helpful that our 14 15 court reporter is going to be transcribing everything we 15 16 say on the record for possible use in the hearing that 16 17 wil occur as well as any appeals and other public 17 18 relations purposes perhaps. 18 19 For that reason, I strive to try to make sure we 19 20 have as clear and clean a record as possible. And if 20 21 you wil let me finish my question before answering and 21 22 I'LL try to let you finish answering before I ask my 22 23 next question, that wil probably be helpfuL. 23 24 Also, because nods and shakes of the head and 24 25 uh-huhs and huh-uhs don't transcribe very well, if at 25 7 1 A. I'm the supervisory investigator in the 1 2 Division of Advertising Practices. 2 3 Q. And as the supervisory investigator in the 3 4 Division of Advertising Practices what are your job 4 5 responsibilties? 5 6 A. I supervise the paralegals and investigative 6 7 staff and legal technician staff. 7 8 your reports or 8Q. Is Michael Marino one of 9 subordinates? 9 10 A. No, he is not. 10 11 Q. Okay. How long have you been with the FTC? 11 12 A. 21 years. 12 13 Q. What other roles or job responsibilties other 13 14 than your current job responsibilties have you held 14 15 with the FTC, if any? 15 16 A. As investigator. 16 17 17Q. Okay. 18 A. That's --that's alL. 18 19 Q. Okay. And what training did you have as an 19 20 investigator for the FTC, if any? 20 21 A. Well, prior to my employment with the FTC, I 21 22 worked for two law firms. But prior to that, my 22 23 training -- 1 have a certificate in paralegal studies 23 24 from the Institute for Paralegal Studies in 24 25 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. And prior to that, 1 have a 25 2 (Pages 5 to 8) 6 all, if I prompt you to say is that a yes or is that a no, that's no disrespect intended. I just want to make sure the record is clear. Okay? A. i understand. Q. Super. Also, if I ask any questions that you don't understand -- and particularly as jet lag begins to seep into me, I may be prone to that -- please let me know, and I'll do my best to clarify. Okay? A. Okay. Q. Great. Ms. Colbert, you were recently identified as a witness for the FTC in the Daniel Chapter One case. And I'm familar, for instance, with Mr. Marino's role, but I have to confess I'm not familar with your role at all, so I'm going to do my best to ask generally what your role is here and what your responsibilties are for the FTC, and so forth, and try to understand more specifically essentially what your testimony is going to be at the hearing in this case. So that's just a litte bit of backstory. With that in mind, can you tell me, what is your title with the FTC? 8 BA degree from Mount Holyoke College. Q. Okay. When did you first become familar with Daniel Chapter One? A. I became familiar with it through the 2007 cancer Internet surf. Q. Is that also known as Operation False Cures? A. Yes, it is. Q. Okay. And were you -- strike that. How were you involved in Operation False Cures generally? A. 1 made sure that the database that we maintain was operational for data entry of Web site claims that we found. i sent -- 1 disseminated electronic mail to our regional office participants regarding the surf, announcing the surf, and providing instructions. Q. Correct me if I'm misstating what I think i just heard. But is it accurate to say that you're the person that kind of constructed at least the technology aspects of Operation False Cures? A. Well, in connection with the technology, if you mean the database, 1 had assistance from our litigation support division. The database was preexisting. We used it as a prototype for all the surfs that we've conducted over the years. For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Colbert 1/22/2009 9 10 I Q. Can you give me examples of other surfs that i 2 you've conducted over the years other than 2 3 Operation False Cures? 3 4 A. In 2006 there was a surf for diabetes treatment 4 5 and cure products. 5 6 MR. ZANG: Ms. Colbert, I'm sorry to interrupt, 6 7 but before you go any further, I just want to caution 7 8 you not to give testimony about surfs that have not been 8 9 publicly identified, if any. 9 10 THE WITNESS: Okay. 10 1 I MR. ZANG: Okay. 11 12 THE WITNESS: And prior to that, there had been 12 13 some about ten -- eight to ten years ago. 13 14 There was one after the 9- I I catastrophe for 14 15 biochemical and -- well, products related to terrorism. 15 16 Let's see. 16 17 And prior to that, in the late '90s, there was 17 18 one that was conducted for serious disease claims such 18 19 as HIV/AIDS, arthritis, cancer, and the like. 19 20 BY MR. McCORMACK: 20 21 Q. Okay. Is my understanding correct that in each 2 I 22 of these surf situations, surf projects or operations 22 23 that what the FTC was looking for were claims of some 23 24 sort, health claims of some sort that were deemed false, 24 25 misleading, unfair? 25 I i I think of a surf as putting a word or a series of words i 2 in the Google search bar and hitting \"go\" and seeing 2 3 what comes up. 3 4 Are the surf parameters kind of like that on a 4 5 more sophisticated basis? 5 6 A. Yes. That's pretty much rudiment, fundamentally 6 7 how it's done. 7 8 I mean, we use other -- a number of other search 8 9 engines so that our results are varied. 9 10 10 Q. Okay. i I A. But there are certain terms or phrases or i i 12 vocabulary that was suggested or recommended to surfers 12 I3 to employ. I3 14 Q. And now, when you say \"surfers,\" you're talking 14 15 about investigators and paralegals? 15 16 A. Yes. 16 17 Q. Do you recall what the search terms were that 17 18 were used for Operation False Cures? 18 19 A. Melanoma, carcinoma, tumor, and then phrases 19 20 such as miracle cure, scientific breakthrough. 20 21 Q. Were any protocols for creating the database 21 22 written up to guide the surfers? 22 23 A. I'm sorr. Would you repeat that, please. 23 24 24 Q. Sure. 25 Were any protocol -- well, let me rephrase it 25 A. Yes. In addition to effcacy claims because -\u00ad well, in connection with the 9- I I, the terrorist products, it could have been apparatus or apparel, so performance claims, too. Q. Okay. In terms of the diabetes claim, for instance, that was essentially directed, though, to health claims -\u00ad A. Yes. Q. -- related to diabetes. A. Yes. Q. Okay. Moving forward to closer to the present time anyway, Operation False Cures was a surf exclusively directed to cancer claims; am i right about that? A. Yes. Q. Okay. And if you can, explain to me how the parameters of that surf were set up- and how it was conducted. A. The parameters included terminology, ceitain terminology that might be prevalent in claims of that sort. We were looking for express and implied claims for treatment and cure of cancer. Q. Okay. Can I parse that out just a little bit. You said terminology. I'm a -- as much as I've been around it, I'm a tech novice, so bear with me. i entirely. Was there any list of terminology printed up for FTC surfers to use for Operation False Cures? A. Yes, there was. Q. Do you know if those lists stil exist? A. Yeg. It does. Q. IS Operation False Cures stil going on to this day? MR. ZANG: Let me just -- I want to interrupt for one minute. And Mr. McCormack, I just want to state a general objection. I'm going to allow Ms. Colbeit to answer that question, but I do want to state for the record that any testimony going to investigations, either Daniel Chapter One or other ones, I do want to preserve our right to claim the investigatory and governmental deliberative privileges. And Ms. Colbert, I'm going to allow you to testify generally about the mechanics, and so foith. If it sounds like you're getting too much into information that may involve discussions that you've had or advice you've been given with FTC attorneys, J may need to instruct you not to go further or answer. THE WITNESS: Okay. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. And so far it hasn't been my intention to ask 3 (Pages 9 to 12) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921 -5555 12 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Colbert 1/22/2009 131 14 I you those questions. I'm just looking for the mechanics i presume. 2 right now, so thank you. 2 A. Yes. 3 So the terminology -- there's a terminology list 3 Q. Okay. You used the phrase \"express or implied 4 that exists for the surfers to use for 4 claims.\" 5 Operation False Cures; right? 5 How, for purposes of preparing the database, are 6 A. Yes. The list contains some vocabulaiy, some 6 implied claims determined or evaluated? 7 phrases, just recommended, just suggested. It wasn't 7 MR. ZANG: Objection to the extent that that's 8 anything that had to be used. 8 calling for some sort of legal conclusion, but if you're 9 Q. Okay. Did the sufferers have discretion to go 9 asking for the witness' understanding, her own 10 beyond that list, to your knowledge? 10 understanding, that's fine. I I A. Yes. i i MR. McCORMACK: I'm certainly asking for her 12 Q. And so what was -- if you know, what was the 12 testimony and only her testimony. 13 general direction or instruction given to the surfers i 3 THE W1TNESS: Okay. 1mplied claims are 14 for purposes of conducting their searches? i 4 understood to be not literal but suggestive. 15 A. Looking for express or impl ied claims for i 5 For example, the URL might imply something to 16 treatment and/or cure of cancer. i 6 the surfer or the consumer. 17 Q. Was the word \"treatment\" included in the i 7 BY MR. McCORMACK: 18 terminology list, do you know? Do you remember? 18 Q. Okay. Any other guidelines that you're familiar 19 A.I don't remember. i 9 with to evaluate whether a claim is implied as opposed 20 Q. Okay. How about the word \"cure\"? 20 to express? 21 And not remembering is fine as you might 2 i A. Well, 1 just don't remember verbatim what was in 22 remember. 22 the instruction sheet that the surfers would have been 23 A. I don't remember, but probably. 23 reading. 24 Q. Okay. And the surfers could certainly use their 24 Q. To your knowledge, who prepared the instruction 25 discretion in using those words for their search 1 25 sheet? 15 16 i A. I did. 1 To whom do you report? 2 Q. Okay. Do you know, is that instruction sheet a 2 A. To Richard Cleland. 3 document that you'll be testifying about when the the 3 Q. And was it Mr. Cleland who gave you sort of 4 Daniel Chapter One case goes to hearing? 4 directive to prepare this database for 5 A. I don't know. 5 Operation False Cures? 6 Q. Now, in terms of -- I want to stick with this 6 A. Well, when 1 became aware that there was going 7 notion of implied claims. 7 to be a surf, 1 just -- i knew from past experience that 8 Strike that. 8 we were going to need a database, so i called the 9 Let me go back to the instruction sheet. 9 litigation support individual who helps with databases, 10 Did you prepare the instruction sheet on your i 0 helps construct databases, and got it set up and i i accessible. i i own or was that in collaboration with a team? 12 A. 1 used instructions that had been used in the 12 Q. Okay. So to be more specific, I guess what I'm 13 past. I incorporated specifics for cancer, such as the i 3 interested in, did at some point, before you prepared 14 terminology, the disease terminology or the -- but the 14 the database or to help guide you in preparing the i 5 phraseology \"scientific breakthrough\" or \"miracle cure,\" 15 database, did you receive instructions about your role 16 those are really general, general phrases. 16 in Operation False Cures, written instructions? 17 Q. Who came up with the -- that didn't sound very i 7 A. Written instructions about my -- what my role i 8 good. 18 would be? i 9 How was Operation False Cures specifically 19 Q. Correct. 20 developed and launched? Were you part of a team that 20 A. No. 2 i made that decision? 21 Q. Okay. 22 A. No. 22 A. No. 23 Q. Do you know who was? 23 Q. Okay. Did you receive verbal instructions? 24 A. Not really. No. 24 A. No. 25 Q. Okay. All right. 25 Q. Okay. So you knew the surfwas starting and 4 (Pages 13 to 16) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Col bert 1/22/2009 17 18 1 you knew what your role was based on past experience 1 also. 2 and -- 2 MR. ZANG: Mr. McCormack, I've been giving you 3 A. Just from past experience, yes. 3 a lot of leeway on this line of questioning. I just 4 Q. Got it. Okay. All right. 4 want to point out that Ms. Colbert is not necessarily 5 Now I'll go back to the notion of implied 5 aware and no foundation has been established of, you 6 claims. 6 know, what the investigators working on the surf, for 7 Are there any specific instructions given to 7 example, actually did. I mean -- or you haven't 8 surfers to guide them in determining what an implied 8 established that. 9 claim entails? 9 And to the extent you're asking about their lOA. There is a brief explanation in the instruction 10 thought processes rather than hers, I would just point 11 sheet. I lout that there's no foundation, so I'm giving you 12 Q. I couldn't do it if I were in your shoes, but 12 leeway -\u00ad 13 I'm going to ask you anyway. 13 MR. McCORMACK: Your objection is noted. Right? 14 Do you remember any ofthose instructions from 14 We're objecting to form. Those are preserved. 15 the instruction sheet or the definition of what an 15 Object to form. You can strike them later. i 6 implied claim is from that instruction sheet? 16 We're doing fine. Thank you. 17 A. No. Not from the instruction sheet, no. 17 BY MR. McCORMACK: 18 Q. Do the surfers make any evaluation of what they 18 Q. SO are the surfers -- and let's stick with the 19 think consumers would interpret from the alleged claims 19 surfers who were involved in Operation False Cures. 20 that they're searching? 20 To your knowledge, are the surfers trained with 21 A. No. 21 respect, for instance, to -- trained in consumer 22 Q. Okay. What did they use to guide them? Their 22 awareness about implied claims, for instance? 23 own sense of things? 23 A. Well, the surf was conducted among our regional 24 A. I presume, yes, that's what they use to guide 24 offces, and i initially sent the invitation/instruction 25 them. Some of the surfers are experienced investigators 25 sheet to the office director, and from there surfers 19 20 1 were selected, so I don't know how they were selected. 1 BY MR. McCORMACK: 2 And I know some of them have been with the FTC 2 Q. Ms. Colbert, I'm handing you what's been marked 3 for a while. It's possible that some of them had not 3 DCO Exhibit Number 4, which I understand to be the 4 been employed here that long and might not be as learned 4 dietary supplement guide provided to us by complaint 5 with surfing and identifying claims. 5 counseL. 6 Q. Okay. To your knowledge, with respect to 6 If you'd just take a moment to look through that 7 surfers who either you picked or with whom you may have 7 and see if that's in fact the document to which you just 8 worked, was there any policy information given to those 8 referred. 9 surfers about what constitutes an implied claim? 9 A. Yes, it is. 10 A. I -- in my offce in advertising practices in 10 Q. Okay. So what wee see there in Exhibit Number 4 lIthe Washington offce, I gave information to the surfers 11 is a piece of information that you supplied to your 12 in that offce. What happened in the regional offces I 12 surfers in your regional offce for use in 13 don't know. 13 Operation False Cures. 14 Q. Understood. 14 A. That's correct. 15 Do you remember what information you gave to the 15 Q. Okay. Anything else that you provided to your 16 surfers in your offce? 16 surfers? 17 A. There's a booklet. It's for industry. they had questions to feel free to 17 A. No. Only if 18 Advertising for industry, a dietary supplement 18 come to me, any confusion or questions. 19 advertising for industry, but it's on our Web site. 19 Q. Now, let's -- I want to stick for the time being 20 MR. McCORMACK: Right. 20 to how Operation False Cures unfolded within your 21 Excuse mejust a second. Off the record. 2 i experience, mindful that -- well, actually let me make 22 (Discussion off the record.) 22 sure of this. 23 (DCO Deposition Exhibit Number 4, 23 When did you first become aware of 24 FTC-DCO 1041-1070, Dietary Supplements: An Advertising 24 Daniel Chapter One? 25 Guide for Industry, was marked for identification.) 25 A. It would have been early July of2007 because 5 (Pages 17 to 20) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 1/22/2009 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Col bert 21 22 I the surf lasted from June 25th through the 27th, and I I all the results of the surfs from all the regional 2 would not have received the printouts from anyone for a 2 offces. 3 couple days, so it would have had to have been the end 3 A. Yes. 4 of June, early July. 4 Q. Okay. Do you recall how many you got? And by 5 Q. Now, are we talking 2007? 5 \"how many\" I mean how many different dietary supplement 6 A. Yes. 6 companies you got. that uncovered Daniel Chapter One, 7 A. Well, there were well over a hundred. 7 Q. Did the surf 8 if you wil, originate out of your offce, do you know? 8 Q. Okay. And if you would, walk me through the 9 A. i don't know. i only know that it was an FTC 9 mechanics, without tellng me about conversations you i 0 staffer who found it. i 0 had with counsel, walk me through the mechanics of what Ii Q. Do you know which FTC staffer it was? I I you did with that data. 12 A. No, i don't. 12 A. Okay. Well, we had to discard any duplicates, 13 Q. Okay. Do you know out of what offce that FTC i 3 which there were several of.14 staffer worked? 14 Q. Okay. 15 A. No, i don't. 15 A. We also were not interested in Web sites selling 16 Q. Okay. So to the best of you i' recollection, i 6 books. 17 share with me how it unfolded that you became familiar 17 Q. Okay. 18 with Daniel Chapter One. 18 A. So that's how we sifted out a lot of Web sites. 19 A. After the surf ended, surfers sent -- well, from 19 Q. Okay. Were there any other fiters or 20 the regional offces they sent via Federal Express 20 parameters that prompted you to use some discretion or 21 printouts from the Web sites that they found and felt 21 decision-making authority about which ones moved forward 22 were pertinent. 22 and which ones you tossed? the23 From the surfers within advertising practices 23 A. Well, the degree of egregiousness of 24 offce, they would have handed them to me. 24 claims. 25 Q. Okay. So you were the central clearinghouse for 25 Q. Okay. I'LL come back to that in just a second. -.-.---..-----.--.----------~--.---------.---. 24 1 Was any consideration given at -- strike that. 1 Q. Back to the degree of egregiousness. 2 Help me with the time frame or sequencing. 2 Can you explain to me what the parameters were 3 The surf occurred roughly June 25 to June 27, 3 for evaluating egregiousness? 4 2007, and within roughly the next 30 days is when the 4 A. Well, ifthe statements were -- made blatant 5 data came in by Federal Expi'ess and otherwise from the 5 claims of curing, reversing, stopping, any -- if the 6 offces? 6 consumer could take away any understanding of the 7 A. Yes. 7 disease being deterred in any way. 8 Q. Okay. Were you and your staff pretty much on 8 Q. And I presume that during this process you're 9 top of that data and going th rough it immediately or was 9 exercising your discretion in making that evaluation i 0 there some period of time before you got to it? Do you i 0 about the degree of egregiousness. Is that right? 11 remember? 11 A. Based on what i just said, yes. 12 A. i don't remember. 12 Q. Correct. 13 Q. Okay. All right. 13 A. Yes. 14 At the time that you were going through the 14 Q. Was that you exclusively or were you part of a i 5 initial data -- strike that -- initially going through 15 team doing that? 16 the data, you're kind of the first threshold evaluator I 16 A. Preliminarily it was just me. 17 gather; is that fair to say? 17 Q. Okay. In the course of your work in exercising 18 A. That's fair to say. 18 that discretion, have you been empowered or instructed 19 Q. Okay. Was any consideration given to, for i 9 or educated in consumer surveys or any other FTC 20 instance, whether the company or organization was a 20 information about what consumers are or are not aware of 21 nonprofit? 21 in regard to health claims for supplements or how they 22 A. No. 22 interpret health claims for supplements? 23 Q. Okay. Was any consideration given to whether 23 MR. ZANG: Objection. Compound question. 24 the organization was a religious organization? 24 BY MR. McCORMACK: 25 A. No. 25 Q. Do you understand that? 6 (Pages 21 to 24) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et al. Colbert 1/22/2009 25 I A. Yes. 2 Just from 21 years of experience. 3 Q. SO nothing specific or formal, just your work at 4 the FTC for a long period of time. 5 A. Yes. 6 Q. Okay. So you talked about initially you were 7 the one exercising your discretion. It sounds like 8 there was a second phase to that process. 9 Did I understand that right? lOA. That's correct. 11 Q. Okay. Can you describe the second -- just 12 mechanically what the second phase was without getting 13 into conversations with counsel that may have occurred. 14 A. Okay. After I had identified the Web sites that 15 I thought should be sent advisory letters, i passed 16 those on to Richard Cleland. 17 Q. Do you recall that this was the -- that during 18 this phase was when you identified Daniel Chapter One? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. Okay. Again, mindful that I couldn't do it ifl 21 were in your shoes, but do you recall specifically about 22 the material you received about Daniel Chapter One that 23 prompted you to put them in the -- I'll call it the 24 egregious pile? 25 A. No, I don't. Not specifically, no. 27 i Do you recall any of the other fields? 2 A. Yes, i do. 3 Q. And what were they? 4 A. The company name. 5 The product. 6 Product ingredients. 7 The URL, the Web site URL. 8 The company contact information, address, phone 9 and fax. 10 Whether it was a domestic or foreign i 1 enterprise. 12 And the source of the surf materiaL. 13 Q. When you say \"source,\" again are you -- you mean i 4 Web site as opposed to brochures or -\u00ad 15 A. Well, FTC, where the surfer was. 16 Q. Okay. Got you, got you, got you. Okay. i 7 In the course of your work in evaluating the 18 degree of egregiousness, as you've described it, did 19 you keep any notations, either by hand or 20 electronically, about the results and the process of 21 your evaluation? 22 A. No. 23 Q. Can you estimate how much time you spent 24 evaluating each of the supplement providers in terms of 25 determining, yeah, they make the egregious pile, no, 26 1 Q. One thing I should have asked you at the 2 beginning, and I apologize for not remembering to do so, 3 is: What, if anything, did you do to prepare for your 4 deposition today? 5 Did you review any documents, for instance? 6 A. Not really, no. 7 Q. Okay. Sometimes that's the safe way to go. 8 Okay. So if you can remember specific to 9 Daniel Chapter One -- let me stick with 10 Daniel Chapter One. 11 Do you remember specifically the kind of data 12 you received about them that you first evaluated? 13 A. The kind of data? We had -- well, we have 14 several fields that we were entering data into. 15 Q. Okay. 16 A. And there's one field for claims. 17 Q. Okay. 18 A. And those were taken from the materials that 19 were submitted. 20 Q. On the Web? 21 A. Yes. 22 Q. Was there any other media that was researched 23 besides what was on the Web, to your knowledge? 24 A. No, there wasn't, not to my knowledge. 25 Q. You talked about claims being one field. 28 1 they don't make the egregious pile? 2 MR. ZANG: Objection. Lack offoundation with 3 respect to supplementary or dietary supplementary 4 manufacturers. 5 BY MR. McCORMACK: 6 Q. Do you understand the question? 7 A. Could you repeat it, please. 8 Q. Sure. 9 Can you estimate on average how much time you 10 spent evaluating each supplement manufacturer? 11 MR. ZANG: The same objection, lack of 12 foundation. 13 THE WITNESS: The printouts that I received? 14 BY MR. McCORMACK: 15 Q. Yes, ma'am. 16 A. i would say at least 10 to 15 minutes. 17 Q. Per manufacturer. 18 A. Yes. 19 Q. Okay. Do you recall on average how much data 20 in terms of number of pages you received per 21 manufacturer? 22 A. It varied. 23 Q. Okay. From one page to a hundred in some cases 24 maybe? 25 A. Maybe not as many as a hundred, but from, you 7 (Pages 25 to 28) For The Record, Inc.

Do you recall how many pages of data you 12 information?11 13 received about Daniel Chapter One? 13 A. Yes. The pages on which he approved -- the 14 A. No, sir, i don't. 14 pages which he approved are the Web sites, the URLs, 15 Q. SO again to get back to the mechanics of the 15 that received advisory letters. 16 process -- I'm not looking for conversations, yet 16 Q. And were you the one that engineered the 17 anyway -- you passed the data on to Mr. Cleland. i 7 advisory letters after he gave the information back to 18 A. Yes. i 8 you? 19 them. One of Q. Okay. What was the next step in i 9 A. i supervised the dissemination of 20 Operation False Cures, to your knowledge, from there? 20 our paralegals actually manually, you know, sent them 21 A. Mr. Cleland would review what i submitted to him 2 i out. 22 and make a judgment call as to whether the Web site 22 Q. Who crafted the language of the advisory 23 would receive an advisory letter or not. 23 letters? 24 Q. Okay. To your knowledge, what is Mr. Cleland's 24 A. i really am not sure about the collaboration of 25 job title? 25 the letter, the final form of the letter. 32 1 Q. Ok.y. Once the .dv;,o'Y C.n yon 2 insofar as your role was concerned or has been 2 estimate? 3 concerned, what happened next? 3 A. i don't remember. 4 A. i believe we alerted the Web site operator to 4 Q. Okay. Okay. 5 get back to us about what they were going to do in 5 At this point in the process, though, it's stil 6 connection with our letter within ten days i believe it 6 essentially your project; am I right?was. 7 I mean, you're the -- are you the primary person 7 8 So after approximately I'd say fifteen -- we 8 kind of managing the sequence of steps and the 9 gave a grace period of maybe five days -- we went 9 communication with the target? 10 back -- or i went back to review the Web site to observe lOA. Yes. I 1 whether there had been any changes made, any revisions, I I Q. Okay. All right. your 12 any modifications. 12 So walk me through, to the best of 13 Q. Do you recall doing so in the Daniel Chapter One i 3 recollection, what happened with Daniel Chapter One, but 14 instance specifically? 14 I'm mindful you may not remember specifically, in which 15 A. Specifically, no. i 5 case let me know and just tell me what would have 16 Q. Okay. 16 happened generally. 17 A. There were so many. i don't specifically i 7 Once you sent the advisory letter, requested 18 remember. i 8 feedback, requested changes to the Web site, what 19 Q. And are we stil talking targets, I'll call i 9 happened next with Daniel Chapter One, if you recall? 20 them, numbering close to a hundred as best you can 20 A. i don't specifically recall if 21 recall? 21 Daniel Chapter One communicated with us directly. 1 22 A. Yes. Yes. 22 don't recall providing any additional guidance or 23 your recollection, of 23 infonnation.Q. Okay. To the best of the Web site had 25 many of them had complied to your satisfaction by 25 e-mailed back to ask for additional information or 24 that hundred roughly, at this point in the process, how 24 But generally speaking, if 8 (Pages 29 to 32) For The Record, Inc.

To the best of your recollection, at 2 been an e-mail exchange back and forth. ! 2 the point in the process that we're talking about now, i3 Q. When you say \"additional information or i 3 did you or anyone that you were working with on 4 additonal guidan.ce,\" can you be more explicit? I 4 Operation False Cures investigate what 5 A. For example, it might have to do with whether I 5 \"Daniel Chapter One\" referred to, the title of this 6 the Web site linked to another site that made claims or i 6 particular company? 7 whether there was historical use language at the 7 A. No. Not that I know of. I did not. I don't 8 Web site or whether there were animal studies being 8 know if anyone else did, but I don't think so. 9 passed off as, you know, effective for humans, that type 9 Q. Do you know as you sit here today? 10 of thing to clarify, for clarification. 10 MR. ZANG: Objection. Relevance. I I Q. The advisory letters that were sent out, were i i BY MR. McCORMACK: 12 they specific in their direction about what needed to be 12 Q. Do you know as you sit here today? 13 done with respect to Web site language or was it generic 13 MR. ZANG: Go ahead. 14 direction, you need to change your language and let us 14 THE WITNESS: is it a bible chapter? 15 know how it's changed? i 5 BY MR. McCORMACK: 16 A. It was a generic letter. i 6 Q. Well, I'm asking you if you know. I'll be happy 17 Q. SO the idea -- correct me if I'm wrong -- was we i 7 to tell you, but-\u00ad 18 have problems with your Web site, you need to change the 18 A. i think it's a bible chapter. That may have i 9 language and we'll take another look at it kind of 19 illuminated in my head before today, but I never 20 thing? 20 researched it. 21 A. Yes. Correct. 21 Q. Okay. So you don't know what bible -- assuming 22 Q. All right. And you don't recall specifically 22 it is a bible chapter, you don't know what it refers 23 with respect to Daniel Chapter One what took place in 23 to. 24 terms of that kind of exchange? 24 A. No, I don't.25 A. No, i don't. 25 Q. Okay. All right. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 35 i-------------------- 36 i All right. So we have -- we're walking through i 1 Q. Of the roughly i OO? 2 this pl\"cess, and this is very helpful. i appreciate A. Yes. 3 it. As far as I'm concerned, you're doing fine. i ~ Q. Okay. So the other eighty or so were 4 You've sent out the advisory letter to noncompliant? I 4 5 Daniel Chapter One and others. There is 01' perhaps not A. Yes. 6 an exchange of dialogue about the Web site language. Q. IS there a -- I think you testified to this, but I ~ 7 To the extent you can recall with let me ask it specifically.I 7 8 Daniel Chapter One, what happened next? those sites that did comply? Is there a list of 9 A. Well, i really can't specifically recall I ~ A. There's no list, no. 10 Daniel Chapter One, but generally speaking? 10 Q. Okay. Is there any way -- is there any database 11 Q. Yes, ma'am. 11 with which one could evaluate the kind of changes that 12 A. i would go back to review the Web site. 12 passed muster? 13 Ifno changes had been made, i would put that 13 A. No. 14 URL on a list of noncompliant Web sites. 14 Q. Okay. Who made the decision, in those twenty 15 If changes had been made and they were 15 cases that passed muster, who made that decision that 16 acceptable, we would acknowledge the changes and thank 16 those sites -- the changes passed? 17 the Web site operator for cooperating. 17 A. I did. 18 Q. In terms of Operation False Cures, do you have a 18 Q. And with anyone else or was that exclusively in 19 recollection of how many sites made changes that were 19 your hands? 20 acceptable? 20 A. It was in my hands. 21 A. I really don't recalL. 21 Q. Okay. Other than the considerable experience 22 Q. A percentage perhaps? \u00a122 that you've had at the FTC, have you had any specific 23 And I'm just looking for the best of your 23 training about what a structure/function claim is? 24 recollection. A. No other additional training, no.124 25 A. i am guessing maybe approximately twenty. 125 Q. Have you had training at the FTC about what a 9 (Pages 33 to 36) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 1/22/2009 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Colbert 37 38 1 structure/function claim is? 2 A. Yes. 3 Q. Can you describe the training for me. 4 A. Well, it wasn't classroom training. It's mostly 5 reading on my own. 6 Q. Okay. 7 A. And just in discussions, general discussions 8 over the years. 9 Q. Has there been any -- was there any specific 10 source of information or education on what is a 11 structure/function claim that you relied on? 12 A. Well, this, this document-\u00ad 13 Q. Are you talking about Exhibit 4? 14 A. -- Exhibit 4 -\u00ad 15 Q. Okay. 16 A. -- and other like FDA pieces ofliterature I've 17 read. I can't specifically identify them at this time. 18 Q. Okay. So continuing with the mechanics of what 19 unfolded, for those who did pass muster after the 20 changes or who were noncompliant, what happened next? 21 A. Well, may 1 add something? 22 Q. Absolutely. 23 A. That one of the changes -- a Web site would have them just 24 been considered compliant because some of 25 totally changed their marketing, their product, their 39 1 Q. -- letter phase. 2 A. Correct. 3 Q. Okay. 4 It sounds like we're gettng to that point in 5 the process, though, mechanicalIy. 6 So you've identified -- you identified in the 7 context of Operation False Cures those sites that 8 remained noncompliant. 9 What happened next? 10 A. I'm sorry. Could you-\u00ad II Q. Sure thing. 12 A. -- repeat that, please. 13 Q. Sure. 14 Once you identified those sites that were 15 noncompliant, what happened next with respect to those i 6 sites and their operators? 17 A. 1 let Richard Cleland know which sites were 18 noncompliant. 19 Q. In writing or e-mail? 20 A. In most likely -- I'm trying to remember. 21 Probably -- most likely in writing. I can't really 22 recall how, how it was transmitted, but most likely in 23 writing. 24 Q. Okay. Do you recall, to the extent it was in 25 writing, was it just a list or did you prepare comments 10 (Pages 37 to 40) 1 format, totally -- they were totally different from what 2 they started out as, so that was one, one of the -- the their being considered compliant. 3 premise of 4 Q. Okay. Did any of them to your recolIection shut 5 down altogether? 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. Do you remember how many ofthose? 8 A. No, I don't. 9 Q. Within the 100? lOA. 1 don't remember. 11 Q. Okay. Okay. 12 ActualIy before we take the next step in the your work sending 13 mechanical process, in the course of 14 out advisory letters, and so forth, did you and the FTC 15 in these advisory letters ever ask for substantiating 16 information? 17 MR. ZANG: Objection to the extent that's 18 calling for a legal conclusion. 19 You may go ahead. 20 THE WITNESS: Okay. 21 Substantiation is typically requested after -\u00ad 22 no, we did not. 23 BY MR. McCORMACK: 24 Q. Okay. Not at least in the advisory -\u00ad 25 A. Correct. 1 about each site? 2 A. Well, I had a printout of each screen of the 3 database and 1 would write -- i wrote on the page. 4 Q. On the printout of the page itself. 5 A. Yes. The database page, yes. 6 Q. And what did you write? 7 A. Compliant or noncompliant. 8 Q. Nothing more, though? 9 A. No. 10 Q. Okay. AII right. What was the next step after 1 1 that, if you know? 12 A. I really don't know. 13 Q. Okay. At what point in the process, if you 14 know, was the request for substantiation sent out? 15 A. 1 don't know. 16 Q. Okay. Do you know that that did occur, you just 17 don't know when? 18 A. I would assume that it was requested after the 19 further law enforcement action, after fui1her law 20 enforcement action was deemed necessary. 2 i Q. But you weren't involved in that process. 22 A. No, i was not. 23 Q. In terms of your role, what, if anything, 24 happened next with those sites that were deemed 25 noncompliant? Again, your role. For The Record, Inc.

Okay. Do you recall specifically whether you those databases with respect 4 consulted either or both of 5 to Daniel Chapter One products? 6 A. I don't recall specifically, no. 7 Q. Do you know who maintains either of those 8 databases? 9 A. No, I don't. 10 Q. Do you know -- okay. i 1 Do you know -- a slightly different question -\u00ad 12 who loads the data into them or the source, the sources 13 for the data? 14 A. No, I don't. 15 Q. Okay. Is research into those databases standard 16 operating procedure in surfs like this one? 17 A. It is for me. i 8 Q. Okay. In the context of Operation False Cures, 19 do you recall finding substantiating data for any of 20 the products or ingredients for the manufacturers 2 I ta rgeted? 22 MR. ZANG: Objection to the extent it's calling 23 for a legal conclusion. you can. 24 Go ahead and answer if I did find any suppoi1ing 25 THE WITNESS: If I data, it wasn't a hundred percent proof that something 2 was effective. There might have been preliminary 3 findings that suggested that something might be 4 effective, but i don't recall finding anything for any 5 of the products we found, you know, to really support 6 effcacy. . 7 BY MR. McCORMACK: , 8 Q. Did you pass on any of that data that you found I 9 to Mr. Cleland along with the Web sites on a 10 manufacturer-per-manufacturer basis or not? Do you I I remember? 12 A. Well, 1 don't believe I consulted the database 113 for every single Web site, but for what I did consult, 14 yes, I did attach information. Or ifMr. Cleland had a 15 question about a specific ingredient or compound, I 16 would have consulted the database and provided him with 17 the results. 18 Q. Does the FTC, specifically the Division of 19 Advertising Practices, have any healthcare providers on 20 staff? MR. ZANG: Lack offoundation. 121 THE WITNESS: No. 22 BY MR. McCORMACK: 123 124 Q.

Okay. I'm going to go back to reviewing my 2 notes. Bear with me here just a minute. That's a sign 3 that I'm drawing to a close, that I can't think of any 4 more questions. 5 MR. J. TURNER: We have some, too. 6 MR. McCORMACK: I figured you would. 7 (Pause in the proceedings.) 8 BY MR. McCORMACK: 9 Q. Ms. Colbert, do you have any specific 10 recollection of speaking directly with anyone from 11 Daniel Chapter One itself? 12 A. No. i never spoke with anyone from 13 Daniel Chapter One. 14 Q. Okay. Do you recall speaking with anyone who 15 used Daniel Chapter One products? 16 A. No. 17 your Operation False Cures Q. In the course of 18 work, did you speak with consumers of any of the 19 products at issue? 20 A. No. 21 Q. Did you conduct any purchases of 22 Daniel Chapter One products? 23 A. No. 24 MR. McCORMACK: What I'm going to suggest is we 25 take just a five-minute break. You can run down the 47 1 MR. ZANG: I'll take it under advisement. 2 Appropriate privileges. 3 MR. McCORMACK: I wouldn't expect you to do 4 otherwise. That's fine. And that was more for my 5 mental note than anything else. 6 BY MR. McCORMACK: 7 Q. I have just a half a dozen to a dozen more 8 questions and then I think we'll be done. 9 First of all, in the course of your work on 10 Operation False Cures specifically, did you do any 11 consulting with the FDA, anyone from the FDA? 12 A. Yes. 13 Q. And describe for me when, where, how, who, 14 what. 15 MR. ZANG: And just let me say I'm going to let 16 Ms. Colbert answer, but i do want to state the 17 governmental investigative and deliberative process 18 privileges as well as joint law enforcement privilege. 19 . 1 just want to put that on the record to preserve our 20 privileges, but you may go ahead and answer. 21 THE WITNESS: We spoke with FDA staff off and on 22 during the -- in the duration of the surf. I can't 23 pinpoint any specific dates. 24 BY MR. McCORMACK: 25 Q. What was the subject matter of those hall, I can confer with my co-counsel, capture lingering questions, and then we'll travel the last mile home. THE WITNESS: Okay. MR. McCORMACK: All right. Thank you. You've been very patient. (Recess) BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Back on the record. A. I'd like to amend a previous answer. When you had asked if I had reviewed any documents in preparation for the deposition, I did look at like a little summary page that I had where I had counted up how many Web sites we had sent e-mails to and how many replied. Q. Okay. This is a summary page that you had prepared? A. Yes. Just for my own reference. Q. And when did you review that? A. It would have been late last week. Maybe Friday. Q. And that was in preparation for today? A. Yes. Just as a recollection. MR. McCORMACK: I'll tr to remember to make a request for that, and then we can decide -\u00ad 1 consultations? 2 A. The nature ofthe surf, at what stages we were 3 in the surf, when we were going to send out advisory 4 letters. 5 Q. Okay. Was the purpose of that consultation 6 with the FDA to advise them about the status of the 7 surf or was it to receive feedback and input from the 8 FDA? 9 A. More just to let them know the status of the 10 surf. 11 Q. Do you recall -- and specifically yourself, do 12 you recall gettng any guidance from the FDA personnel 13 that you were in contact with during 14 Operation False Cures? 15 MR. ZANG: Again, same objections. 16 THE WITNESS: Can I ask to confer? 17 MR. ZANG: Yes. 18 (Witness and counsel confer.) 19 THE WITNESS: The FDA was another surf partner, 20 so we were in touch with them about the topics that i 21 just mentioned. 22 BY MR. McCORMACK: 23 Q. Sure. Let me try to be more specific. 24 Did you ever seek guidance from the FDA in 25 making the evaluations about the claims that came up in 12 (Pages 45 to 48) For The Record, Inc.

Okay. All right. Were there any other surf 8 A. S-H-A-N, as in Nancy, O-F-F. 9 partners? 9 And another staffer is Carol Kando, K-A-N-D-O, 10 A. No. 10 Pineda, P.I-N-E-D-A. i i Q. Thanks for bearing with us. This goes with the 11 Q. A few more specifics just to flush out the i 2 territory. Thank you. 12 mechanics of Operation False Cures a little bit 13 Are you aware of any press releases that the FTC 13 further. 14 issued about Operation False Cures and the results of the 14 i think you've said that in the process of i 5 the operation? i 5 surfers pullng data off the Web, either the surfers or 16 A. I believe there was a press release issued. I i 6 yourself made a column where claims were identified? i 7 don't recall the content of it specifically. 17 Did I understand that right? 18 Q. Did you have any role in preparing that press 18 A. There's a field. i 9 release? 19 Q. Okay. A field, a field for claims. 20 A. No. Not that I know of. 20 Who filled those fields in? 21 Q. Okay. Okay. Do you know who did? 2 i A. Our interns and myself and a paralegaL. 22 A. Not specifically, but our press office, our 22 Q. SO with respect to the claims that were 23 public affairs offce, most likely would have put it 23 identified for Daniel Chapter One in that field, do you 1124 recall specifically who did it? 24 together. you know, who would have directed 25 A. No, i don't. 25 Q. And who -- if 13 (Pages 49 to 52) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 -----Daniel Chapter One, et al. Colbert 53 1 Q. Okay. And when you say interns, yourself and 1 2 the paralegals, did you all participate or one of 2 those 3 three groups would have done so but hard to discern 3 4 whom, who specifically? 4 5 A. We all worked on the project at different times 5 6 during the day or during the week. 1 really couldn't 6 7 say who filled in the Daniel Chapter One claims field. 7 8 your recollection, was the 8 Q. Okay. To the best of 9 instruction to paraphrase the claim or write it 9 10 word-for-word verbatim? How did that unfold? 10 11 MR. ZANG: Objection. Lack offoundation. 11 12 THE WITNESS: To take it from the printout that 12 13 we received. 13 14 BY MR. McCORMACK: 14 15 Q. Okay. And was it to be taken verbatim from the 15 16 printout you received? 16 17 A. Yes. 17 18 Q. Okay. You indicated that there were about a 18 19 hundred, give or take, sites identified from 19 20 Operation False Cures and that I think you said about 20 21 twenty were deemed compliant? 21 22 A. Yes. 22 23 Q. And then I also asked you how many of the sites 23 24 shut down, just outright shut down. I think you said 24 25 some ofthem did, but you weren't sure how many. 25 55 1 i me -- made changes but whose sites stil did not pass 2 muster? 2 3 A. I would have communicated with them to say that 3 4 we'd noted the changes that had been made, but there 4 5 were still -- we stil had problems with some other 5 6 portion that had not been attended to. 6 7 Q. And was another -- to the extent you can 7 8 remember, did the site owner or operator make another 8 9 effort to make the changes in those cases? 9 10 A. Yes. 10 i i Q. Were they resolved, generally speaking? 11 12 A. Some were; some were not. 12 13 Q. Okay. And again, ultimately those that were 13 14 fell into the twenty or so that were compliant and 14 15 those that weren't -- never -- were noncompliant 15 16 obviously. 16 17 A. Correct. 17 18 the sites that were 18 Q. Do you know how many, of 19 ultimately deemed noncompliant, how many went to 19 20 complaint, where a complaint was actually issued? 20 21 A. No, i don't. 21 22 Q. Okay.

Did you include those sites that shut down within the group that was compliant? A. Yes. those twenty, some shut down, some changed suffciently to pass muster. Q. Okay. So in other words, of A. That's correct. those twenty, do you recall how manyQ. Okay. Of just outright shut down and how many actually made changes? A. No, I don't recalL. Q. Is that on the list that you reviewed the other day? A. It may be. I don't remember specifically each itemized entr. It may be. Q. Okay. Okay. your recollection, did any sites make changes or adjustments but did not pass muster? Did any -- to the best of A. Yes. Q. Again, do you recall how many? A. I don't recall how many. Q. To the extent that you remember either specifically or generally, would there have been an interim step with those folks who made sites -- excuse 56 A. 1 don't recalL. Q. However many there were outside the twenty that were either shut down or compliant I presume. A. Correct. Q. Okay. All right. And I think I asked you if you know who Michael Marino is. A.

But not on this matter. Q. Okay. Okay. Also I think I asked you this, but let me make sure. Was the word \"cancer\" one ofthe target triggers for the database search? A. 1 think so.

Richard L. Cleland, 601 New Jersey, Northwest, 16 Washington, D.C. 17 Q. Mr. Cleland, I can presume the answer to this 18 question, but I'm going to ask it anyway. 19 Have you ever had your deposition taken before? 20 A. Yes. 21 Q. How many times? 22 A. Not a lot. Maybe three or four times. 23 the Q. Okay. I'll dispense with most of 24 formalities other than to suggest, as you already know, 25 if there's any question you don't understand, that is 7 1 The district court decision in the 2 National Urological case. That involved some 3 weight-loss products. 4 So the answer to your question is yes. 5 Q. Other than the urological case that you just 6 identified, any others that involved dietary supplements 7 or purported dietary supplements? you don't remember, that's 8 And obviously if 9 fine. 10 A. Yeah. I'm not -- I don't recalL. 11 Q. Okay. Before us here on the table, Mr. Cleland, 12 are four documents that have been marked Exhibits DCO 1, 13 2, 3 and 4. 14 While I'm having our court reporter mark 15 Exhibit 5, if you'd take a look at those four exhibits 16 and tell me if any of them are documents you reviewed in 17 preparation for today's dep. 18 (Pause in the proceedings.) 19 (DCO Deposition Exhibit Number 5, Notice of 20 Deposition Pursuant to 16 CFR 3.33(c), was marked for 21 identification.) 22 THE WITNESS: The only document that I looked at 23 of Deposition Exhibits 1,2,3 and 4 would have been 24 Deposition Exhibit Number 3, which is labeled 25 Complaint Counsel's Answers to Respondents' First Set of 2 (Pages 5 to 8) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net- (800) 921-5555 8 Daniel Chapter One, et al. Cleland 1/22/2009 9 10 I Interrogatories. And my primary reason for -- and I did I 2 not review the whole thing but only those questions that 2 -'.. related to issues that were raised in the notice of 3 4 deposition. 4 5 BY MR. McCORMACK: 5 6 Q. Prior to reviewing Exhibit Number 3 in 6 7 preparation for your deposition, had you seen this 7 8 document, the interrogatory answers? 8 9 A. I may have seen a draft ofthat document. 9 10 Q. Okay. Do you recall participating in the 10 11 preparation of the answers prior to reviewing the I I 12 document in preparation for this deposition? 12 13 A. Yes. I had input into some of the answers. 13 14 Q. Okay. Okay. And -- okay. 14 15 And forgive me, but i didn't catch your answer 15 16 if you did. 16 17 Did you review document Exhibit Number 4? 17 18 A. I did not review Deposition Exhibit Number 4. 18 19 19 Q. Okay. Let me show you now what's been marked 20 Deposition Exhibit Number 5, DCO Number 5, a copy of the 20 21 notice of deposition that brings you here today. i 2 I 22 think you said you reviewed that. Correct? 22 23 A. Yes. 23 24 Q. And it's my understanding that you are prepared 24 25 to give testimony in response to the five areas of 25 11 1 A. I am assistant director for the Division of I 2 Advertising Practices. 2 3 Q. And can you give me sort of a Reader's Digest 3 4 version of what the job responsibilities are for that 4 5 position? 5 6 A. It's primarily a supervisory position. I 6 7 supervise and manage other attorneys and their 7 8 casework. 8 9 Q. Do you also supervise investigators and 9 10 paralegals? 10 11 A. Well, I would be supervising anybody that was I I 12 involved in one of my n one of the cases that I was 12 13 responsible for, and that would include, depending on 13 14 the case, investigators or paralegals. 14 15 Q. Okay. And when you say -- when you say \"cases,\" 15 16 are you talking about specific respondents or are you 16 17 also including operations like Operation False Cures, 17 18 for instance? 18 19 A. It would be both. 19 20 Q. Okay. All right. 20 21 How long have you been the assistant director of 21 22 advertising policy? 22 23 MR. GORDON: Advertising practices. 23 24 MR. McCORMACK: Practices.

Is there any area identifed in 1 through 5 that you are not prepared to give testimony about? A. Not that I'm aware of at this time. Q. Okay. We'll find out, won't we. With respect to Exhibit Number 5, Mr. Cleland, can you tell me, to the extent that you know, how you were selected to give testimony as opposed to somebody else. MR. GORDON: Let me object to the form of that, but go ahead, if you know. THE WITNESS: I volunteered. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Okay. And was the call yours to make essen tia lIy? MR. GORDON: Objection to form. Go ahead. THE WITNESS: Actually had lead counsel objected to it, I think I would have considered an option. BY MR. McCORMACK: you would just generally what Q. Okay. Tell me if is your -- well, first, what is your job title with the FTC? the answer to that question. It seems like a long time. Probably about roughly eight years. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. And how long have you been with the FTC overall? A. Since 199L. Q. And prior to your current role, what was your role? A. Well, i had bounced back and forth. I was the -- starting -- let me start from 1991 and move forward. It makes more sense going that direction. Q. Okay. That's fine. A. From 1991 until about 1994 I was a senior attorney in the Division of Advertising Practices doing litigation. Then 1 spent a year and a half to two years, approximately, in the Bureau of Consumer Protection office where I was the coordinator for the regional offces. Then J spent two years as the assistant director in the Division of Service Industry Practices, where my function actually was pretty much the same as it is now, supervising attorneys in cases and operations. Q. Could I interrupt you. 3 (Pages 9 to 12) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 12 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Cleland 1 /22/2009 t' 13 14 What does \"service industry\" mean? the job responsibilities divide up that neatly. 1 1 2 A. Well, it was half of the -- half of the division 2 I make various decisions on what cases or what .. 3 essentially dealt with things like investment frauds, .: the staff recommendation is going to be. I paricipate 4 art frauds, things like that, and the other half of the 4 in the selection of cases.

I've even led 6 medical services. 6 a case where it was necessary. it was a big enough 7 7 case. Q. As opposed to products or devices? 8 A. Right. 8 So I don't think that -- it doesn't break down 9 9 squarely in -- at least at my level, it doesn't breakQ. Okay. Okay. 10 A. And then that division was dissolved, and I went 10 down squarely into only supervise, only -- because I 11 back to the Division of Advertising Practices where i 11 do -- the truth is, I do a great deal of all those 12 was a senior attorney for three or four years and then 12 functions. 13 became the assistant attorney -- assistant director for 13 BY MR.

Cleland i /22/2009 17 18 1 I THE WITNESS: Well, initially I -- my 2 recollection is -- and I'm not sure this is in the scope 2 3 of the notice, but to the extent my recollection is that 3 4 Lynne developed the initial list of search terms and 4 5 that other people, including myself, may have reviewed 5 6 those and had suggestions as to either some that might 6 7 not work or some that would be better or -- although I 7 8 don't have a -- i don't have any recollection of doing 8 9 any editing in that process, but she would have showed 9 10 them to me. 10 1 i BY MR.

And I got 25 _.~._-~. 19 i Go ahead. 1 2 THE WITNESS: Okay. 2 \" -' I mean, 1 -- what I can do is refer you to the 3 4 case law. And in particular i would refer you to cases 4 5 like Thompson Medical and Kraft. Those cases discuss 5 6 the different forms, different types of claims in the 6 7 context of the commission's evaluation of what messages 7 8 are conveyed in an ad. 8 9 In those cases, the commission talks about the 9 10 claims range from claims that are express, which in 10 i i which, you know, the meaning of the claim is apparent on i i 12 its face, to cases or claims that are nearly express, 12 13 meaning, you know, it's obvious from its face, to 13 14 implied claims to claims that, you know, all the way on 14 15 the far end that ultimately that a reasonable consumer 15 16 might not take or at least the commission couldn't 16 17 conclude with confidence that a reasonable consumer 17 18 would take from an ad. And as to those claims, the 18 19 commission suggested in those decisions that extrinsic 19 20 evidence might be necessary. 20 21 So we're really talking about a range of clarity 21 22 of a particular claim. 22 23 BY MR. McCORMACK: 23 24 Q. SO it's a range of clarity. 24 25 A. Uh-huh. 25 back a -- those recommendations. Then I reviewed the Web sites and came up with a list of Web sites that I thought were plausible law enforcement targets. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Okay. Were there specific criteria that you utilzed from a policy standpoint to make that, I'll call it, target evaluation? MR. GORDON: Objection to form. Go ahead. THE WITNESS: In general what we were looking for were what we considered to be express or nearly express claims that -- based on what we understood were unlikely to be substantiated or likely to be false. BY MR. McCORMACK: what -- the phrase you used, \"nearly express claims,\" Ms. Colbert I'll represent to you used the word \"implied.\" One of the challenges we find in this case is trying to interpret and understand the FTC policies and guidelines as well as regulations if they exist that Q. Okay. In terms of define what an implied claim is. A. Uh-huh. Q. Can you tell me what the criteria is for evaluating what you called the nearly express claims. MR. GORDON: Objection to form. what an implied claim or nearly express claim is. Q. So no set definition of MR. GORDON: Objection to form. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. It's a matter of discretion, is it not? MR. GORDON: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: Well, it is a -- you know, the-\u00ad with the exception of an express claim. An express claim is it is what it says. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Right. A. That essentially all claims that are not express claims are subject to some interpretation. Q. Okay. From a policy standpoint, Mr. Cleland, once a case is assigned for prosecution, what role do you continue to play, if any, in, say, monitoring the case through its litigation process? MR. GORDON: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: If it is a case that is being handled by the Division of Advertising Practices and it was one of my cases, I will continue to manage the litigation, not as lead attorney but as the ultimate decision maker in matters of -- involving the case.

Cleland 1/22/2009 21 22 I 1 Is Daniel Chapter One one of your cases, as you 2 just used that phrase? 2 3 A. No, it is not. 3 4 Q. Okay. To what extent in your role are you 4 5 involved in craftng what I call the requested 5 6 remediation that appears in the complaint? 6 7 MR. GORDON: Is that in a general matter? 7 8 MR. McCORMACK: Let's talk specific to & 9 Daniel Chapter One. 9 10 Thanks for that clarification. 10 11 BY MR. McCORMACK: I I 12 Q. Do you know what I mean by \"requested 12 13 remediation\"? 13 14 A. I think you're talking about the notice order, 14 15 what I would -- 15 16 16Q. The proposed order? 17 A. As proposed. 17 18 Q. The proposed order. 18 19 A. We would call it the notice order. 19 20 Q. That's what I'll call it then. 20 21 A. 1-- 21 22 MR. GORDON: And what's the question at this 22 23 point? 23 24 MR. McCORMACK: What's his role in crafting 24 25 that, the language of that notice order. 25 23 MR. GORDON: Objection to fonn. 2 Go ahead. 2 3 THE WITNESS: Yes. 3 4 BY MR. McCORMACK: 4 5 Q. Okay. And was that proposed letter -- i call it 5 1 I 6 attachment A to the complaint -- was that proposed 6 7 letter the same in every complaint that was fied based 7 8 on Operation False Cures? 8 9 MR. GORDON: Objection to the form. 9 10 Go ahead. 10 11 THE WITNESS: It should have been substantially I I 12 the same in all cases. 12 13 BY MR. McCORMACK: 13 14 14 Q. Okay. 15 A. Whether or not, because some of these cases 15 16 were settlements, there may have been some minor 16 17 variations based on the negotiations in a particular 17 18 case. 1& 19 the model pleadings and 19Q. Okay. So in terms of 20 the notice order that was part of the model pleadings, 20 21 in every complaint fied under Operation False Cures was 21 22 there a requirement that the respondent send to 22 23 consumers a letter that included references to 23 24 conventional cancer treatments? 24 25 MR. GORDON: Objection to the form. 25 6 (Pages 21 to 24) THE WITNESS: I think it would be fair to say that because there were multiple cases involved in Operation False Cures, we used what we would refer to as model pleadings for the cases so that the cases would end up with essentially the same type ofreliefto the extent that we could, given the different forums that were involved in some of the cases. In terms of developing the model pleadings which ultimately became I think the basis for the notice order in this case, I was active in drafting those model pleadings. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Okay. A. And to the extent that I think it -- I can't say that i had the final word on those pleadings because that would have been a matter for ultimately for the Bureau of Consumer Protection staff and the commissioners that voted out the complaint. Q. In the model pleading process that you just described for Operation False Cures then, do i understand your testimony correctly that you had at least a role in crafting the proposed letter that respondents would have to send in the event -\u00ad A. Yes. Q. -- the ALJ ruled against them? THE WITNESS: I think that the answer to that question is yes. The one case that I'm not a hundred percent sure is the case that involved a company called Bioque or a product called Bioque. And I'm not a hundred percent sure whether that order contained that provision, my recollection that it is, that it did, but I'm not a hundred percent certain on that. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Do you remember who the manufacturer or respondent was for that particular product? Did you call it Biocure? A. Bioque. Q. Bioque. A. No, I don't, but it would have been one of the cases that would have been referred to in the press Daniel Chapter One. release announcing the filing of Operation False Cures.Q. Okay. So it was part of A. Yes. Q. Okay. All right. And just to close this loop, that particular matter did go to an order, an order was entered? A. Yeah. There was a consent. Q. Okay. That was my next question. Thank you. In terms of policy and craftng that notice order, Mr. Cleland, does the FTC give any of For The Record, Inc.

The second page of that Exhibit 9, 22 beyond the -- and B, it's beyond the scope. 23 Mr. Cleland, if you could turn to that, and I'd like you 23 Also are you asking whether he agrees or is he 24 to direct your attention to the -- 24 agreeing that that's the FTC policy? 25 A.

GORDON: Objection to the form. 4 no reason to dispute that unjustified consumer injury is 4 THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not aware of -- given 5 the primary focus of the FTC Act. 5 that I just said I wasn't aware of any complaints being 6 BY MR. McCORMACK: 6 filed, it would follow that l'm not aware that anyone is 7 Q. You have no reason to dispute that. 7 claiming economic injury. 8 A. Right. 8 BY MR. McCORMACK: 9 Q. Okay. 9 Q. Well, there may be some investigation done lOA. As for whether or not it's the most important 10 outside the complaint process, which is why I was 11 ofthe three criterias in S&H, that was obviously the 11 asking. 12 opinion of the authors of the letter of the 12 But none that you know of. 13 commissioners at the time. Whether that continues to 13 A. As to specific consumers, no. 14 be the position of the current commissioners I do not 14 Q. Okay. All right. 15 know. 15 So the injury component involved in the DCO case 16 Q. SO let's talk about injury in the DCO case. 16 is -- what would we call it -- theoretical? 17 Are you aware of any physical injury that has 17 MR. GORDON: Objection. 18 occurred to any consumer or user of the DCO products? 18 THE WITNESS: No. I would not call it 19 A. I am not. I have no knowledge to that effect. 19 theoreticaL. 20 Q. Okay.

It is -\u00ad 23 THE WITNESS: Not to my knowledge. 23 MR. GORDON: Objection. 24 BY MR. McCORMACK: 24 THE WITNESS: It is based on the premise that 25 Q. Okay. Do you know if anyone has been -- is 25 consumers are injured when they are misled and that 17 (Pages 65 to 68) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et al. Cleland 1/22/2009 69 1 they are misled in this instance because they would 1 2 make the -- take the implied claim or make the 2 3 assumption that there was a reasonable basis for the 3 4 claim. And had they known that there was no reasonable 4 5 basis for the claim -- that's the allegation -- they may 5 6 or likely would have made a different decision 6 7 concerning the product. Therefore, in the view of the 7 8 FTC, there is consumer injury. 8 9 BY MR. McCORMACK: 9 10 Q. Okay. How does the FTC make that assumption or 10 11 arrive at that assumption? 11 12 MR. GORDON: Objection to fonn. I think that's 12 13 beyond the scope. 13 14 But go ahead. 14 15 THE WITNESS: Well, 1 believe that that 15 16 deduction, that inference, is made based upon both 16 17 common sense viewing how consumers actually operate in 17 18 the marketplace as well as the commission's 18 19 institutional knowledge, having been involved in 19 20 consumer and consumer behavior for almost a hundred 20 21 years. 21 22 BY MR. McCORMACK: 22 23 Q. Okay. So common sense and institutional 23 24 knowledge. 24 25 A. Well, and the observation, as 1 said, that 25 71 1 1 implied claim from those representations that such a 2 reasonable basis existed. 2 3 Since they don't have the knowledge that no 3 4 reasonable basis existed, the likelihood that they 4 5 would -- the commission's rationale is that a consumer 5 6 would likely make a different decision if they knew -- a 6 7 different economic decision if they knew that the DCO or 7 8 the advertiser had no reasonable basis to make the 8 9 claim. 9 10 what information does the FTC 10 Q. On the basis of i 1 make that inference? 1 i 12 A. I've already answered that question. 12 13 Q. And has the -- and in the DCO case, has the FTC 13 14 determined that there was no reasonable basis for the 14 15 statements that DCO made? 15 16 MR. GORDON: Objection to the form. 16 17 THE WITNESS: The detennination that the 17 18 commission has made is that there is reason to believe 18 19 that there is no reasonable basis for the claims, for 19 20 the representations that are set forth in the 20 21 complaint. 21 22 BY MR. McCORMACK: 22 23 you would, direct your attention to the next 23 Q. if 24 page, Bates-stamped 806, specifically the first sentence 24 25 of the first full paragraph, which reads: \"Second, the 25 18 (Pages 69 to 72) 70 consumers -- that consumers would likely act differently if they knew that there was no basis, no reasonable basis for DCO's claims. Q. And how -- if there's been no communication with users of DCO products, how does the FTC know how those folks would operate differently? MR. GORDON: Objection to the form. THE W1TNESS: 1 think that's a reasonable inference based on the f\u00e0cts. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. And that's an inference that the FTC is making unilaterally. MR. GORDON: Objection to the form. THE WITNESS: 1 don't understand the question. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Are you presuming, Mr. Cleland, in that case that the statements made by DCO in this case are false? MR. GORDON: Objection to the form. THE WITNESS: 1 am presuming that there is no reasonable basis to support the representations that have been made in the complaint-\u00ad BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Okay. A. -- and that consumers either would have a belief that such reasonable basis would exist or take the 72 injury must not be outweighed by any offsetting consumer or competitive benefits that the sales practice also produces. \" Do you see that? A. Where is that? MR. GORDON: This paragraph (indicating). THE WITNESS: The one that starts \"Second, the injury must not\" -\u00ad BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Yes, sir. A. Okay. 1 see that. Q. That is essentially a 1980 iteration of the standard of proof that now appears in 15 U.S.C. 45 subpart (n), is it not? A. That would be correct. Q. Can you tell me in the DCO case if any efforts were made to evaluate whether there was offsetting consumer benefits to the users of DCO products. A. If, as we allege, the claims are unsubstantiated, then there is no offsetting benefit either to competitors or to consumers from those claims. Q. I'm directing your attention to Exhibit 3, the interrogatories and answers to interrogatories in this case, and specifically, Mr. Cleland, I'd like to direct For The Record, Inc.

Is that something different than reflecting FTC 24 policy or not, do those five bullet points accurately 25 policy? 25 state FTC policy for substantiation? 21 (Pages 81 to 84) For The Record, Inc.

I 2 THE WITNESS: I would -- I would have to say 2 \" J that they, at least as to my understanding of Pfizer and 3 4 Thompson Medical, they -- and subsequent cases, they 4 5 accurately reflect the FTC's policy. 5 6 BY MR. McCORMACK: 6 7 Q. Okay. Directing your attention to the first 7 8 block bullet I call it on Bates page 1051 and the 8 9 bolded heading that reads \"The Benefits of a Truthful 9 10 Claim and the Cost/Feasibilty of Developing 10 i i Substantiation for the Claim,\" can you tell me what, if i i 12 anything, has been done in the DCO case to determine 12 13 the cost/feasibility of developing substantiation for 13 14 the statements made -- 14 15 MR. GORDON: Objection. 15 16 BY MR. McCORMACK: 16 17 Q. -- or attributed to DCO. 17 18 MR. GORDON: Beyond the scope of the notice. 18 19 (Pause in the proceedings.) 19 20 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I don't think that there was 20 21 a specific evaluation done in this particular case as to 21 22 the development -- the cost of development of the -- of 22 23 the substantiation. I think it's more of a general 23 24 reference to in general what are the -- can a product be 24 25 tested, how much does it cost to test this kind of 25 87 i experts in -- they could be experts in the field of i 2 cancer treatment. 2 3 BY MR. McCORMACK: 3 4 Q. How about experts in the field of natural 4 5 healing remedies? Would they qualify? 5 6 MR. GORDON: Objection to the form and also 6 7 beyond the scope. 7 8 THE WITNESS: That would depend on their 8 9 credentials and what they were testifying to. 9 10 BY MR. McCORMACK: 10 i i Q. Okay. But it's plausible that they would I i 12 qualify for substantiation under that bullet point. 12 13 MR. GORDON: Objection to the form and beyond 13 14 the scope. 14 15 THE WITNESS: Again, it depends on what they're 15 16 testifying to. 16 17 I mean, you know, that's a question of 17 18 qualifying an expert. 18 19 BY MR. McCORMACK: 19 20 20Q. Okay. 21 A. And we would look -- when we're looking at 21 22 experts to -- and I think this particular element is not 22 23 necessarily meant to be -- you know, we have -- well, 23 24 let me put it differently. 24 25 In terms of consulting experts, our normal 25 22 (Pages 85 to 88) 86 claim. And quite frankly, it is only one offive factors, and not all -- all those factors have to be present. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. To your knowledge, has that analysis been done in any case involving health claims made by a purported dietary supplement manufacturer? MR. GORDON: Objection. Beyond the scope. THE WITNESS: And I don't know the answer to that. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Okay. Look at the last block bullet point there you would, please, Mr. Cleland, on that same page if which reads \"The Amount of Substantiation that Experts in the Field Believe Is Reasonable.\" A. I see that. Q. Okay. Can you tell me with respect to the DCO you know, what is meant or intended by \"experts in the field\" -- strike that. What field are we talking about there with respect to Daniel Chapter One? MR. GORDON: Objection. Beyond the scope. THE WITNSS: Well, we're talking about experts case specifcally, if in the fields of -- that would be in the field of the representations that were made here. They would be 88 procedure is to consult experts not only in the disease that we're talking about -- and we are talking about a disease here -- but, you know, experts that would also have some knowledge of what needs -- what would have to be -- from a scientific standpoint, what kind of substantiation would you need for experts in that field the disease to be -- you know, to be generally accepted as, you know, in terms of its reasonableness. of We have consulted with disease experts. We have consulted with -- and I'm speaking generally -- with experts in alternative medicine. We have consulted with experts in natual products. We have consulted with experts in homeopathic products. So we're not exclusive in our consultations. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Are you talking about in the DCO case or in general? A. No, I'm not talking about the DCO case. the claims or statements, as is alleged in the DCO case, are not made for scientific purposes but for religious purposes? MR. GORDON: Objection to the form. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Okay. What if Q. Does it make a difference? MR. GORDON: Beyond the scope. For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Uan\u00edel Chapter Une, et al. Cleland i /\"L\"LILUUY 89 90 1 THE WITNESS: If those statements are made to 1 2 promote the sale of a product, it doesn't make a 2 3 difference. 3 4 BY MR. McCORMACK: 4 5 Q. And if they -- if the products are offered to 5 6 substantiate the Daniel Chapter One passage from the 6 7 bible, does that make a difference? 7 8 MR. GORDON: Same objection. 8 9 THE WITNESS: If the products are being 9 10 marketed, advertised to the public for purposes 10 11 represented in those advertisements, that's what the FTC 11 12 looks at. 12 13 BY MR. McCORMACK: 13 14 Q. And if -- is there a difference between an 14 15 advertisement and an offering? 15 16 A. The advertisement in this case is any -- it's 16 17 any document that promotes the product or attempts to 17 18 induce the consumers to purchase the product. 18 19 MR. McCORMACK: Okay. Let's take five. 19 20 MR. GORDON: Okay. 20 21 MR. McCORMACK: I'll review my notes, confer 21 22 with counseL. We're twenty minutes from needing to get 22 23 you out of here anyway. 23 24 THE WITNESS: Okay. 24 25 (Recess) 25 91 1 a placebo or a treatment group. 1 2 Q. Can you think of any products, generic products 2 3 themselves that fall under that category? 3 4 MR. GORDON: Same objection. 4 5 THE WITNSS: Can I think of any. 5 6 Where it usually plays out is that there will 6 7 be substantiation perhaps for a claim as opposed -- 7 8 you know, one representation as opposed to 8 9 representations about a whole product or something to 9 10 that nature. 10 11 And I'm trying to think of specific examples, 1 1 12 and I'm sure that ifI were given adequate notice, 1 12 13 could come up with some, but sitting here I'm not sure. 13 14 BY MR. McCORMACK: 14 15 Q. And how about the same question, any cases that 15 16 you're familar with that the FTC has dealt with where 16 17 health claims were made by homeopathies that were found 17 18 to be substantiated? 18 19 MR. GORDON: Same objection. 19 20 THE WITNESS: I don't recall any of those cases 20 21 where -- and again -- no. No need to go beyond that. I 21 22 have no recollection of that event. 22 23 MR. McCORMACK: Okay. Great. 23 24 Thank you. I have no further questions. 124 25 THE WITNESS: Okay. 125 BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Mr. Cleland, to your knowledge, has the FTC ever dealt with a case in which health claims for a purported dietary supplement were adequately substantiated? MR. GORDON: Objection. Beyond the scope. THE WITNESS: Yes. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Can you think of how many instances? MR. GORDON: Same objection. THE WITNESS: No. i wouldn't have a clue. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Okay. Fair enough. A. I mean, i could -- because the FTC is a big organization, number one -\u00ad Q. Sure. A. -- so... Q. Do you recall what the sources of the substantiation for those cases was? MR. GORDON: Same objection. BY MR. McCORMACK: Q. Or what the sources were? A. In most of the -- in -- in most of those instances they would have been clinical studies with humans, with control groups randomly assigned to either MR. GORDON: Why don't we take-\u00ad MR. McCORMACK: Yep. (Pause in the proceedings.) MR. GORDON: We don't have any questions. That's fine. THE WITNESS: Thank you. MR. McCORMACK: Thank you. I appreciate it.

MIL L E R, having first been 2 duly sworn by a Notary Public of the State of New York, 3 was examined and testified as follows: 4 EXAMINATION BY 5 MR. S. TURNER: 6 Q. Good morning. 7 A. Good morning. 8 Q. Dr. Miller, could you state your name, address 9 and professional title for the record. 10 A. Yes. Denis R. Miller, D-E-N-I-S. My address 11 is 36 East Lake Road, Tuxedo Park, New York 10987. 12 My official title? 13 Q. Yes, whatever your professional title is. 14 A. I'm a therapeutic area leader for oncology 15 hematology at Parexel, P-A-R-E-X-E-L, all capital 16 letters, International. 17 Q. Thank you. Dr. Miller, you met Betsy Lehrfeld 18 who is here, Chris Turner, and I'm Jim Turner, and we 19 are representing the respondent in this case, Daniel 20 Chapter One. 21 A. Yes. 22 MR. J. TURNER: What we're planning to do today 23 is go over your expert witness report and talk about 24 that and I want to do three things: One is to talk 25 about how the report was prepared, that's the first For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 -www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 14 1 Do you have a background in nutrition? 2 A. Am I a nutritionist, no. Do I know about 3 nutri tion as it relates to cancer patients, yes. 4 Q. Can you describe your knowledge about nutrition 5 as it relates to cancer patients? 6 A. Well, I'm very aware of the importance of 7 nutri tion in cancer patients. I'm very well aware of 8 the adverse effects of malnutrition. 1'm aware of how 9 important it is for cancer patients who are undergoing 10 therapy to make sure that they're well hydrated and not 11 malnourished and, if they are, to treat those 12 deficiencies so they can tolerate their treatment 13 better and have a better quality of life. 14 I am constantly engaged in working with 15 nutri tionists and metabolic colleagues to help support 16 cancer patients that I treated in a comprehensive and 17 full way. 18 Q. Do you have any training in nutrition? 19 A. No. 20 Q. Do you have any certifications in nutrition? 21 A. No. 22 Q. I noted in your credentials that you were 23 involved in oncology/hematology. Is that your area of 24 expertise? 25 A. 11m board certified in oncology and hematology. For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 -www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 97 1 there may be other warnings, other side effects and 2 they usually list them all. 3 Q. Okay. I want to now go to the part of the 4 report\" Detailed Discussion of Findings\" and begin with 5 Bio* Shark. 6 A. Yes. 7 Q. You began that by saying, \"The key questions 8 relating to Bio*Shark are: Does Bio*Shark inhibit 9 tumor growth? Is Bio*Shark effective in the treatment 10 of cancer?\" 11 A. Yes. 12 Q. Who formulated those questions? 13 A. Well, I formulated the questions in response to 14 the scope of work on page four where I said I had been 15 asked by the FTC to determine whether there is 16 competent and reliable scientific evidence to support 17 or substantiate the following claims, and the first 18 one, does Bio*Shark inhibit tumor growth, and the 19 second, Bio*Shark is effective in the treatment of 20 cancer, and I turned ita -- I asked the question and 21 addressed those questions with the available 22 peer-reviewed literature that addressed whether or not 23 Bio*Shark inhibits tumor growth and whether or not it iS 2 4 effective in the treatment of cancer. Q. You state that a number of reported For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 -www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 25 142 1 effect of curcumin.\" 2 I don't know one by Rao, \"Chemoprevention of 3 colon carcinogenesis by dietary curcumin.\" So all of 4 these papers that I've cited, talk about dietary 5 curcumin. Some of them they may have mentioned where 6 they came from, what the historical background was, but 7 that is where that statement came from. All of these 8 published papers and peer-reviewed literature use the 9 term curcumin, not tumeric. 10 Q. You make the statement concerning lacking 11 double blind placebo controlled randomized clinical 12 trials of curcumin. Could you summarize your -- the 13 significance of that section in which you talk about 14 the lack of those studies? 15 A. Before I got to that sentence I described what 16 are the reported studies and what some of the results 17 were of those studies, particularly some of the studies 18 in patients who are at high risk of developing colon 19 cancer, but the ultimate step to demonstrate in a 20 competent and reliable way that curcumin actually does 21 these things would be to do a double blind placebo 22 controlled randomized clinical trial. That i s how we do 23 things to show that it really is effective. 24 Q . Effective? 25 A. In preventing cancer or treating colon cancer. For The Record, Inc.

Just peruse those and tell me if you've ever seen those documents before. (Pause in the proceedings.) A. Okay. i briefly looked at these. Q. And have you seen these documents before?

Oh, I don't know. what you received from DCO 3 Q. Independent of 4 Web site 01\" with the products, did you do any 5 investigation about the products themselves from other 6 sources? 7 A. You mean the effcacy -- what is it -\u00ad 8 efficacy? 9 Q. Effcacy? 10 A. No. I I Q. Apai1 from the effcacy, did you do any 12 research about just the elements of the pi\"oducts? 13 A. You mean the ingredients? 14 Q. Yes. 15 A. No. 16 Q. Okay. Did you do any research or investigation 17 about complaints that any user of DCa products had ever 18 made? 19 A. Yes. 20 Q. Okay. TelI me what steps you took in that 21 regard. 22 A. I mentioned before that I went to the BBB's 23 Web site to see if they had any complaints. 24 Q. What did you find? 25 A. 1 could not find any complaints. 51 1 A. Yes. 1 conducted a Consumer Sentinel search. 2 Q. A Consumer Sentinel? 3 A. A Consumer Sentinel search. 4 Q. TelI me generalIy what Consumer Sentinel is. 5 A. Consumer Sentinel is a database that the FTC 6 maintains to keep a record of consumer complaints. 7 Q. And what did the result of your 8 Consumer Sentinel search turn up about DCO? 9 A. There was only one complaint that was listed, 10 and that complaint was entered by Lynlea Givens Oppie. 11 Q. And the complaint was what you'd already 12 described from your conversation? 13 A. Very similar. 14 Q. SO in other words, to the best of your 15 recolIection, Ms. Oppie's complaint as revealed by the 16 Consumer Sentinel search was not about the product but 17 was about her father's testimoniaL. 18 A. i don't remember the specifics of it, but it was 19 substantially similar to what she told me over the 20 phone. 21 Q. Okay. Was a written record kept of your 22 Consumer Sentinel search? 23 A. Not a written record by me. 1 did not make hand 24 notes. However, i did print up a summary of the 25 complaint. Yes. i Q. Other than the BBB's Web site -\u00ad 2 A. Well, let me back up. 3 Q. Yep. 4 A. I'm sorr. 5 Q. That's okay. 6 A. But the reason i couldn't find any complaints 7 was because the BBB -- the search was inconclusive. The 8 BBB didn't have a listing for Daniel Chapter One at the 9 time that I could find, so therefore I couldn't identify i 0 any complaints for Daniel Chapter One. i I Q. Is there a reason -\u00ad 12 (Pause in the proceedings.) 13 Do you have an understanding about why the BBB 14 wouldn't have a listing for Daniel Chapter One? 15 A. No. 16 Q. Do you know if the BBB only opens a fie if they 17 receive a complaint? 18 A. I don't know. 19 Q. Would it be your understanding that the reason 20 there was no listing with the BBB of DCa is that they 21 had not received a complaint? 22 A. i don't know why it's not listed. 23 Q. Okay. Any other sources besides the BBB that 24 you investigated or researched to determine complaints 25 about DCa? 1 MR. McCORMACK: For the record, I'll follow up 2 with you separately. i think we requested that, but i 3 think the response we got is that there is nothing 4 available on that. 5 MR. ZANG: i think the request, \u00a1fit's the one 6 I'm recalling, was regarding consumer complaints against 7 DCO, and Ms. Givens, if that's her name, was not a 8 direct consumer herself. 9 MR. McCORMACK: Could be. We')) double-check. 10 BY MR. McCORMACK: 1 i Q. Mr. Marino, are you aware of any specific 12 injuries that DCa or its products have caused to i 3 consumers? 14 A. i wouldn't know that. 15 Q. You would not know that? 16 A. i would not know that. 17 Q. That was not within the scope of your i 8 investigation then; is that right? 19 A. That's correct. That was -- yes, that's 20 correct. 21 Q. Okay. Apart from the DCO case specifically, is 22 the investigation of specific consumer injury ever 23 within the scope of your job responsibilties? 24 MR. ZANG: I just want to object in terms of 25 lack of foundation with respect to the term 13 (Pages 49 to 52) For The Record, Inc.

ZANG: Objection with respect to the 24 year, 2008. 25 terminology of \"follower.\" Lack of foundation there. 25 Q. Do you have an understanding what the purpose of 47 48 I your contact with Ms. Oppie was? i Q. But did she share anything that indicated she 2 A. Yes. 2 disputed what was in the testimonial? 3 Q.

Mr. Marino, I've got a few more 8 Q. What's her story? 8 questions and I also want to be sensitive to our time 9 A.

I I Daniel Chapter One's Web site, she saw that her 11 You used the word I think in specific reference 12 father's -- her father's name appeared along with a 12 to your purchase of DCa products as an undercover 13 testimonial purportedly by him in which he endorsed 13 purchase. 14 Daniel Chapter One's products, and she was upset about 14 What did you mean by \"undercover\"? is that because he had been dead for several years.

Do you recall the name you used? 18 the company. 18 MR. ZANG: Objection. That would be 19 Q. Is that it as far as you can recall? 19 investigatory privilege. 20 A. Those are the general points that come to mind. 20 MR. McCORMACK: Okay. 1 won't press that one 2 I now. 2 i right now, but I understand. 22 Q. To your knowledge and recollection, did she 22 BY MR. McCORMACK: 23 contradict anything in the testimonial itself? 23 Q. Do you know the identity of any of the -- strike 24 A.

When you receive instructions to investigate 17 any of these small handful of dietary supplement 18 companies, are you looking for the specific claims or 19 are you just kind of following general protocols of 20 downloading information, gathering information, 21 printing information? 22 A. I'm not sure if! understand the question. 23 If you're asking me -- if you're asking me if 24 someone will come up to me and say, Hey, investigate 25 this matter and follow a certain set formula and do 31 1 A. i don't decide what's an important claim and 2 what's not an important claim. 3 Q. Okay. And how about outside of the claims 4 per se? Do you use your discretion in deciding what's 5 important information and what's not important 6 information? 7 A. You'll have to be more specific than that. 8 Q. The name Daniel Chapter One, for instance. 9 A. Would i think that's an -- are you asking me if 10 i would think that's an important what? Ii Q. For instance, do you exercise or did you in this 12 case exercise discretion in deciding that the name 13 Daniel Chapter One was relevant to the investigation or 14 not? 15 A. As a target or as a possible target? 16 Q. As a concept. 17 A. No. 18 Q. Do you know what Daniel Chapter One means or i 9 refers to? 20 A. 1 think it's a biblical reference. 21 Q. Are you familar with the biblical reference by 22 any chance? 23 A. That particular one? 24 Q. Yes. 25 A. Not very familiar, no, just in a very broad 8 (Pages 29 to 32) 30 1 that -- is that what you're asking me? 2 Q. Yes. 3 A. For this type of case? 4 Q. Right. 5 A. Or for Daniel Chapter One in particular? 6 Q. Let's talk first about this type of case. 7 A. Okay. 8 No, that's not what happens. 9 Q. Okay. And was it any different for 10 Daniel Chapter One? 11 A. No. 12 Q. How does it happen? 13 A. Generally an attorney will approach me and an 14 attorney wil tell me, Mr. Marino, could you do this, 15 for example, preserve a Web site, and then I'll preserve 16 the Web site. 17 Q. Okay. So it's not within your job 18 responsibilities -- through the course of your job 19 responsibilties, you're not exercising discretion about 20 what's important within the Web site versus what's not 21 important in the Web site, for instance. 22 A. Are you talking about Daniel Chapter One in 23 particular? 24 Q. Let's talk about Daniel Chapter One in 25 particular. 32 1 sense. 2 Q. Tell me what your broad sense is. 3 MR. ZANG: Mr. McCormack, here I'm going to 4 object on the grounds of relevance. 5 But go ahead. You can answer. 6 MR. McCORMACK: Objection noted. 7 BY MR. McCORMACK: 8 Q. You can go ahead and answer. 9 A. i understand that -- oh, boy. 10 Q. And I don't want you to guess. If you don't 1 i know, that's fine. I'm just curious. 12 A. Yeah. i understand it's a biblical reference i 3 having to do with nature or God being able to help 14 people maybe cure themselves or help themselves or 15 something like that. That's the extent of my i 6 understanding. 17 Q. Sure. 18 Where did you gain that understanding? 19 A. Through general conversation. i don't recall 20 the exact source. 2 i Q. Do you recall if you gained that understanding 22 from the DCO Web site at all? 23 A. No. Absolutely not. 24 Q. Okay. So you're certain that you didn't gain 25 that understanding from the Web site.

Hypothetically what I wait for is a 1 able to capture. 2 prompt from the computer saying it's finished. 2 Q. Okay. 3 Q. Okay. So again, you're relying on the computer 3 A. So in general, that's a factor to be considered 4 to tell you that it's downloaded all the relevant 4 when dealing with Teleport Pro, if I answered your 5 information. 5 question correctly. 6 A. Correct. 6 Q. Okay. So anything that was a stil shot of 7 Q. Now let's talk about Daniel Chapter One 7 text or graphic from the Daniel Chapter One Web site 8 specifically. 8 you believe was captured during the course ofthis task 9 Did you do any manual exei'cise in reviewing the 9 one? 10 Daniel Chapter One Web site? lOA. Not necessarily. 11 A. i don't understand the question. I I Q. Can you explain? 12 Are you talking about while it's saving the 12 A. Yes. Teleport Pro is designed to capture all of 13 information? 13 the files in a particular -- or at a particular Web site 14 Q. Or even afterwards. 14 or in a particular Web site. 15 I guess what I'm interested in knowing is, i 5 In Daniel Chapter One's Web site case -- and 16 during the course of this task one, if you downloaded, 16 this tends to happen in a lot of Web sites that have a 17 captured every single page from the Daniel Chapter One 17 lot of catalogs or large catalogs -- the program tends 18 Web site with information about Daniel Chapter One and 18 to run on and on and on. 19 what it does. i 9 Additionally, Telepoit Pro is also designed to 20 A. Okay. As 1 alluded to earlier, not every 20 seek out other Web sites that are linked to the Web site 21 program that's designed to capture Web sites would 21 you're trying to preserve, so it wil I also start 22 capture every single thing. 22 preserving those Web sites as well, so it could tend to 23 For example, Teleport Pro in some instances 23 run on and on. 24 can't capture pop-ups, can't capture streaming videos, 24 So at some point with Daniel Chapter One i had 25 so for example, those are things that program won't be 25 to make a decision to stop the program; otherwise, it 27 28 1 would just keep going. i Q. Okay. 2 Q. SO at some point you made that decision and 2 A. But let me qualify that -\u00ad 3 saved the disk and handed it to Mr. Waldman. 3 Q. Sure. 4 A. Yes. At some n well, let me go back. 4 A. -- in saying give or take a year or so. 5 At that point when 1 realized that it was just 5 Q. Sure. That's fair. 6 going on and on, I stopped the Web site preservation, 6 Do you know if those investigations were part of 7 the Teleport Pro. I preserved it to the computer. 1 7 Operation False Cures? 8 preserved it to a CD. 1 gave it to Mr. Waldman. 1 8 A. Oh, I have no idea. 9 explained to Mr. Waldman what happened. I suggested 9 Q. Okay. 10 that he review it to make sure it had all the lOA. I don't think so. 1 I information that he wanted preserved. 11 Q. Okay. Were the investigations similar in the 12 Q. Okay. Did you take notes during your 12 sense that you were investigating companies that were 13 performance of the task one you just described? 13 making claims that the FTC was adverse to? 14 A. I don't recalL. I'd have to check. 14 A. I'm SOI1)'. Could you say that again. 15 Q. Okay. Prior to being assigned this 15 Q. Yes. I'll try. 16 investigation of Daniel Chapter One, do you recall 16 Were you, in those previous cases -- I think you 17 having investigated any dietary supplement manufacturer 17 said one or two or maybe two or three -\u00ad 18 before? 18 A. Right. 19 A. Yes. 19 Q. -- when you investigated dietary supplement 20 Q. Can you tell me how many times? 20 companies, were those investigations prompted by alleged 21 A. I think about two times before. 21 claims that those manufacturers had made contrary to FTC 22 Q. Can you give me a general time frame, window of 22 policies and guidelines? 23 time, when those investigations took place? 23 A. i don't know. 24 A. 1 would say approximately four to five years 24 Q. Okay. Do you recall what you were 25 ago. 25 investigating? 7 (Pages 25 to 28) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Marino 1/22/2009 21 22 1 Mr. Waldman for him to review. 1 Q. Okay. 2 Q. Okay. Let me stop you. 2 A. So once you preserve that Web site and then 3 For the record, I'll represent to you that we 3 either preserve it on a computer or a CD, then you're 4 have received a disk I'm going to call it. I'm not a you were 4 able to navigate that Web site just as if 5 tech guy, so bear with me. I think it's a DVD. And I 5 online at the real Web site. 6 put it in the computer and it plays what appears to be a 6 Q. You can navigate it from the CD, for instance. 7 screen shot of a navigation through at least part of the 7 A. Correct. 8 DCO Web site. I can see the cursor move. I can see it 8 Q. All right. We're stil on task one now, and 9 click on certain links, new pages load, so on and so 9 that is preserving the Web site. i 0 forth. 10 Did you capture, preserve, the entirety ofthe i 1 Does that sound familar? 11 DCO Web site? 12 A. It sounds familiar, but that's not the program 12 A. No. i 3 I'm talking about. 13 Q. Why? 14 Q. Okay. What is it that I've just described, if 14 A. Because no program that I'm aware of could i 5 you know? 15 capture everything on every Web site. 16 A. That's a Camtasia recording of an undercover 16 Q. Okay. Is this a case, Mr. Marino, where you 17 purchase I made. 17 essentially hit the \"start\" button and let the program 18 Q. Can you spell \"Camtasia\"? 18 run its course of capturing the Web site, or do you 19 A. C-A-M-T-A-S-I-A. 19 navigate page by page as part of your interaction with 20 Q. Back to the preserving the Web site. 20 the Teleporter (sic)? 21 Maybe explain to me how that's different. you're asking me do I just press a button and 21 A. If 22 Is that just sort of taking stil shots of the helping it record by 22 it records rather than me kind of 23 various pages? 23 prompting it and stuff like that -\u00ad 24 A. What Teleport Pro does is it creates an off-line 24 Q. That is what I'm asking. 25 replication of the Web site. 25 A. It's the former. i press a button. I say 23 24 1 record. I step back. I watch it record. 1 information I have to put into it. 2 \"Record\" is a bad word to use. I let it save 2 Q. Can you give me an example? 3 the data. 3 A. Yes. The most important thing you have to put 4 Q. Okay. How, if at all, do you satisfy yourself 4 in is the Web site address. 5 that you have captured all of the relevant portions of 5 Q. Okay. Anything else? 6 the DCO Web site in that particular case then? 6 A. My recollection for Daniel Chapter One alone -\u00ad 7 A. Generally you'll wait for a prompt from the 7 Q. Right. 8 computer from the program saying, you know, something to 8 A. -- is that that's the only information i put 9 Il. 9 the effect that, you know, the program is finished -\u00ad 10 I'm sorry -- Teleport Pro is finished, and then when 10 Q. SO in other words, you're not also conditioning 11 that happens, you hit \"okay.\" 11 your search by puttng in the word, for instance, 12 Q. But you're relying on the technology to capture the Teleport Pro search engine. 12 \"cancer\"-as part of 13 all ofthe Web site that it deems relevant? 13 A. Yeah. Absolutely not, no. 14 That was a question. 14 Q. Okay. All right. 15 A. Okay. And my answer is this. I rely on the 15 Hypothetically speaking -- and I appreciate your 16 program to capture all of the information that it can 16 patience because I'm trying to figure out how this 17 capture. i 7 works -- how do you satisfy yourself, if at all, that 18 Q. Okay. All right. Does the -- and have I got 18 you've downloaded from the Daniel Chapter One Web site 19 the name right? Is it Teleporter? 19 all of the relevant information, including perhaps a 20 A. Teleport Pro. 20 disclaimer page, for instance? 21 Q. Teleport Pro. Thank you. 21 A. Okay. 22 Does the Teleport Pro require any kind of 22 Q. Hypothetically speaking. 23 loading of data into it, particular search engines or we're talking hypothetically and we're not 23 A. If 24 particular words? 24 talking specifically to Daniel Chapter One -\u00ad 25 A. Yes. At the initial stage there is some 25 Q. I'll go there next. 6 (Pages 21 to 24) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Marino 1/22/2009 18 it I Q. With the FTC? 2 A. No. With I think the Social Security 3 Administration. 4 Q. Do you know when he left the FTC? 5 A. Last year sometime. 6 Q. 2008. 7 A. Correct. 8 Q. Okay. All right. Do you recall what 9 instructions, if any, Mr. -- was it Mr. Waldman? 10 A. Yes. I I Q. -- what instructions, if any, that Mr. Waldman 12 gave you insofar as conducting your investigation of 13 Daniel Chapter One? 14 MR. ZANG: And here i would just caution you, 15 Mr. Marino, to not discuss the substance of those 16 instructions because for that we wil claim a privilege 17 but rather you can certainly start with whether or not 18 he gave you instructions, if you want to ask that 19 question, Mr. McCormack. 20 BY MR. McCORMACK: 21 Q. Did he give you instructions? 22 A. From time to time he gave me instructions. 23 Q. Did you follow those instructions? 24 A. Yes, 1 did. 25 Q. SO why don't you tell me what your very first 19 i was, and certainly I think his understanding bears on 2 how he shaped the concrete tasks. 3 BY MR. McCORMACK: 4 Q. SO it's challenging waters we're sailng here 5 and I think we're doing well, but let me ask you again, 6 Mr. Marino, what was your undei'standing of the purpose 7 of your tasks? 8 MR. ZANG: And again let me just interject, 9 Mr. Marino. If you can distinguish your understanding i 0 from what might have been conveyed to you in terms of i 1 any legal theories or investigatory theories, then you 12 should testify as to that, but that only. i 3 THE WITNESS: Okay. i 4 Mr. Waldman expressed to me that there were 15 some cancer -- some claims relating to cancer -- some i 6 cancer claims that Daniel Chapter One was making and 17 that we wanted to -- that he wanted to preserve the i 8 Web site. 19 BY MR. McCORMACK: 20 Q. SO your understanding was that you were 2 i investigating cancer claims that DCO was making on its 22 Web site; true? 23 A. And possibly other claims. Yes. 24 Q. Other than cancer you mean. 25 A. I think so. Yes. step was after speaking with Mr. Waldman for the first 2 time about DCO. 3 A. The first time Mr. Waldman approached me, he 4 asked me to preserve Daniel Chapter One's Web site. 5 Q. Do you recall when that was? 6 A. That was December 20, '07. 7 Q. Did you have -\u00ad 8 A. I'm sorry. Let me go back. 9 That's -- it was on or about December 20. 10 Q. Fair enough. 11 What was your understanding, assuming you had 12 one, about the purpose for your investigation or, more 13 specifically, why was DCO being investigated? 14 A. Mr. Waldman briefly explained to me that -\u00ad 15 MR. ZANG: I just again want to caution you, 16 Mr. Marino, not to go into the substance of any legal 17 theories or case theories that you might have discussed 18 with Mr. Waldman. 19 And Mr. McCormack, I would ask that you focus 20 your questioning on the concrete tasks that Mr. Marino 21 carried out either under the direction ofMr. Waldman or 22 not. 23 MR. McCORMACK: I'll rephrase the question, 24 although 1 think if we go back and look at it again, 25 we'll see that my question was what his understanding 20 i Q. SO not claims about Oriental tea but claims 2 about specific disease conditions? 3 A. I remember him specifically saying cancer claims 4 at the time. 5 Q. Okay. So task one was to preserve the 6 Web site. 7 A. Yes. 8 Q. All right. And what did you do? As best you 9 can recall, walk me through step by step what you did to i 0 preserve the Web site. i 1 A. Well, first, I went to the computer and I 12 opened a program called Teleport Pro. I opened the 13 program. I placed Daniel Chapter One's Web site 14 address into the program, and then I started preserving 15 the program. i 6 Q. How did you get Daniel Chapter One's Web site i 7 address? i 8 A. It was provided to me by Mr. Waldman. 19 Q. Okay. Thank you. 20 Go ahead. 21 A. When the computer -- when the computer was 22 preserving the Web site, I was monitoring its progress, 23 and then when I was satisfied that I got all the 24 information that i could get, I saved the Web site, the 25 program Web site, I copied it to a CD and I handed it to 5 (Pages 17 to 20) For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Marino 1/22/2009 13 1 privilege on that. 1 2 MR. McCORMACK: Right. And so far I'm -- right 2 3 now I'm trying to find the parameters of that. Indeed, 3 4 I think you and I are on the same page in that regard at 4 5 least so far, which isn't to say we may not collide a 5 6 little bit. But yeah, I certainly understand that and 6 7 wil tr to do my best -- in fact, let me make note of 7 8 that, Mr. Marino. 8 9 At times -- and we're doing great so far, 9 io mindful that it's early, but you might take just a 10 11 brief moment following each of my questions to give 11 12 Mr. Zang an opportunity to jump in as he may need to 12 13 do. 13 14 THE WITNESS: Have I been talking too fast? 14 15 MR. McCORMACK: No. Actually I think you're 15 16 doing great. Believe me, I've had plenty of witnesses 16 17 who were on top of each other, and we're not having that 17 18 trouble right now. 18 19 BY MR. McCORMACK: 19 20 Q. Okay. In terms of -- you've used the word -- 20 21 we've both used the word \"reporting\" to Mr. Zang or 21 22 others through the course of the Daniel Chapter One 22 23 investigation, and I may refer to the respondent here as 23 24 DCO as well, the initials \"DCO.\" You referred to 24 25 reports. 25 15 1 1 much more so on your end, including a privilege log that 2 we're still waiting for from you. 2 3 MR. McCORMACK: I understand that. And my job i 3 4 right now is to get as much as 1 can in the way of 4 5 proper discovery from the FTC, and that's all I'm going 5 6 to worr about for today, but thank you. 6 7 BY MR. McCORMACK: 7 8 Q. Stil on the record, Mr. Marino, how about 8 9 notes? 9 10 Now, did you take any notes through the course 10 11 of your investigation regardless of whether or not they 11 12 were conveyed to FTC counsel in the DCO matter? 12 13 A. Yes. 13 14 Q. Do you know if those notes have been produced? 14 15 A. 1 have no idea. 15 16 Q. Okay. Are you aware t~at a request for your 16 17 fie was made by DCO counsel? 17 18 A. No, 1 was not aware. 18 19 Q. Okay. Do you recall anytime in the past two or 19 20 three weeks being asked to prepare your fie for copying 20 21 or production, for instance? 21 22 A. I don't recall that. 23 Q. Okay. All right. Can you give me a sense of -- 23 24 122 strike that. 24 25 How often did you take notes in the DCO case? 25 4 (Pages 13 to 16) 14 Can you share with us what form those reports took? A. Mostly verbal and e-maiL. Q. Were there exceptions? In other words, you say mostly verbal and e-mail, suggesting that maybe not exclusively verbal and e-mail. A. That's all 1 could recall at this time. Q. Okay. But there were reports that you made by e-mail to your -- I'll call them your superiors in this case. A. Yes. MR. McCORMACK: Just for the record, Mr. Zang, we've requested his full fie, haven't -- Mr. Marino's full file, haven't received copies of those e-mai1s. I'm going to guess, though i prefer not to, that the e-mails to which Mr. Marino just referred are probably going to be claimed as privileged, but we don't have a privilege log either to evaluate those, so when the opportunity presents itself, if we can get that log, that would be helpfuL. MR. ZANG: I'LL certainly take that under advisement. 1, by the same token, remind you and your co-counsel that there is a lot of outstanding discovery 16 I'm talking precomplaint phase. A. Periodically. Q. Okay. All right. Let's attack it this way. Are you familar with Operation False Cures? A. I've heard the name. Q. What do you understand that operation to be, if you have one? A. My understanding of that is that it was a project to identify certain companies that were making misleading claims dealing with dietary supplements. your recollection, can you describe -- strike that. Q. And to the best of Were you asked or instructed to get involved in Operation False Cures as a general matter or were you assigned a specific task to investigate DCO? A. 1 was only asked to investigate DCO. Q. Okay. Do you have any knowledge or understanding how DCO was identified as a subject for your investigation? A. No. Absolutely not. Q. Who directed you to investigate DCO? A. The attorney in charge of the case at the time was Ron Waldman. He approached me. Q. Do you know what Mr. Waldman is doing today? A. He's an administrative judge. For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Daniel Chapter One, et 01. Marino 1/22/2009 9 II adequate answer. 2 Was the training on investigative techniques as 2 \" .) opposed to FTC policies and law do you remember? 3 4 A. The one -- I'm sorry. The one portion of it 4 5 that I do remember distinctly was an interview -- it was 5 6 techniques in interviewing. 6 7 7Q. Okay. 8 8 A. So that's the one class I remember. 9 9 Q. Right. Fair enough. 10 Next let's turn to the organizational structure 10 1 i as you understand it within your department. 1 i 12 Can you give me a sense of to whom you report in 12 13 your job as an investigator? 13 14 A. Generally I'll report directly to the attorney 14 15 15 in charge of the case. 16 Q. Okay. In this particular matter for 16 17 Daniel Chapter One, who is that? 17 18 A. Currently 1 think it's Ted Zang and I think he's 18 19 the lead attorney. 19 20 Q. Are you not certain? 20 21 A. The reason I'm not ceitain is because we've had 21 22 22 several changes. Recently we had several other 23 attorneys assigned to the matter. 23 24 But that's my understanding, Ted is in charge. 24 25 Q. Okay. In the Daniel Chapter One case, are 25 11 1 that I can recall at this point. 1 2 2 Q. And who was the intern? 3 A. I think her name is -- she's new, so I think her 3 4 name is Jeanine. 4 5 Q. Do you know her last name? 5 6 A. No. 6 7 Q. Is Jeanine stil an intern with the FTC? 7 8 A. Yes, she is. 8 9 Q. And what was the task? Do you recall? 9 10 A. Yes. She's -- she is doing some work for us on 10 11 looking at backgrounds for several witnesses for this 11 12 case. 12 13 Q. SO she's working -- she's presently working on 13 14 the case. 14 15 15 A. Yes. 16 16Q. All right. How long has she been working on the 17 Daniel Chapter One case? 17 18 A. She has been working for -- I can answer how 18 19 long she's been working for me. She's been working for 19 20 me probably for the past week or week and a half. 20 21 Q. On Daniel Chapter One. 21 22 A. Yes. 22 23 Q. Okay. Fair enough. 23 24 So she didn't participate in any way in the 24 25 investigation -- I'll call it the precomplaint 25 10 there other attorneys on the case to whom you also report? A. Yes. Q. And who are those? A. David Dulabon, Carole Paynter, and that's who I've reported to in the past, directly to. Q. All right. And you're located here in the New York offce? A. Yes, I am. Q. Do you -- again in the Daniel Chapter One case, have you reported to anyone with the FTC in Washington, D.C.? A. Not directly, no. Q. Okay. Tell me a little bit -- strike that. Do you have reports yourself; that is, do you have people who report to you in the course of your work on any particular case? A. Are you talking specifically for this case? Q. I'm talking generally right now. A. In an informal way I'll have interns conduct assign -- do assignments for me, and they'll report back to me, but that's on an informal basis. Q. How about in this Daniel Chapter One case specifically? A. I've asked one intern to do an assignment for me 12 investigation phase. A. No. Q. To your knowledge, who other than yourself did participate in, I'll call it, the precomplaint investigation stage, if anyone, on Daniel Chapter One? A. From what 1 recall, I worked on the case, Ted Zang worked on the case, another attorney, Ron Waldman, worked on the case. And that was precomplaint. The only reason I'm hesitating is I'm not quite sure when David Dulabon, another attorney here, started working on it. I'm not sure if it was precomplaint or post-complaint. MR. ZANG: Mr. McConnack, let me just interject at this point because I'm not sure where your line of questioning is going, but while for the purposes of this deposition I want to try to allow you to ask as many questions as are appropriate, I do want to preserve for the record the governmental deliberative process privilege, and so, you know, at some points I may interject an objection. And to the extent that Mr. Marino gives the who, the investigative process here, I probably will not interrupt him, but ifhe starts to go what, where of into the substance of the investigation, we do claim 3 (Pages 9 to 12) For The Recordi Inc.

Lucky you. 7 8 Let me give you just a little overview of what 8 9 we're going to do and maybe agree upon some ground rules 9 10 to help the process go a little more efficiently, 10 Ii particularly since we're kind of pressed for time this 11 12 morning. 12 13 Obviously we have a court reporter who is 13 14 transcribing everything that we're all going to say so 14 15 long as we're on the record for purposes potentially 15 16 anyway of transcribing a written record of this 16 17 deposition which can be used in administrative hearing 17 18 proceedings, court proceedings and any other public 18 19 purposes. 19 20 )'11 be asking you a series of questions and 20 21 obviously asking you to do your best to answer those 21 22 questions. And if at any time you don't understand my 22 23 question, let me know. )'11 do my best to clarify. 23 24 Also, nods and shakes of the head and uh-huhs 24 25 and huh-uhs, even though perfectly fine for casual 25 7 1 Whois report. i 2 That's all i could recall offiand. 2 3 Q. Can you describe for me what a Whois report is? 3 4 A. Yes. There are several entities or companies 4 5 that keep track of domain names, and if for some reason 5 6 you want to see what company owns a domain name or what 6 7 company is associated with a domain name, you can do a 7 8 search to find out what that company is. 8 9 Q. Okay. Great. Thank you. We may come back to 9 10 that in a minute. 10 11 For now, though, tell me what is your current 11 12 job description with the FTC. 12 13 A. I'm a Federal Trade investigator. 13 14 Q. Can you tell me what the job duties of an 14 15 investigator with the FTC are as you understand them? 15 16 A. Investigators assist attorneys in collecting 16 17 facts, collecting evidence, to assist them in building 17 18 cases. 18 19 Q. And how long have you been in that role with the 19 20 FTC? 20 21 A. About ten years. 21 22 Q. Have you been an investigator for that entire 22 23 ten-year period? 23 24 A. Before that, 1 was an investigator for the 24 25 Department of Labor for one year. 25 2 (Pages 5 to 8) conversation, don't transcribe very well so that you may find that I may prompt you to answer yes or no. Don't take that as a sign of disrespect. It's simply to make sure that we've got the record clear. Indeed, transcribed depositions really don't go as smoothly as casual conversation, so you may find I'LL try to negotiate us through that. Okay? A. Okay. Q. Super. Thank you. First of all, can you tell me what, if anything, you did to prepare for today's deposition? A. 1 looked over my investigative fie and I met with Ted Zang yesterday. Q. Can you tell me what is in your investigative fie? Just give me for now a Reader's Digest version of what that fie consists of. A. The file consists of pages that I printed up from my undercover purchase of Daniel Chapter One's products. It includes pages that I printed up from the computer from my undercover purchase of Accent Radio Network's two recordings of Daniel Chapter One's radio broadcasts. It has I think a BBB report, a D&B report, a Q. Okay. All right. Is there a particular focus that you have in your responsibilities as investigator? In other words, are there specific cases or do you investigate cases of all types for the FTC? A. I focus on consumer protection cases. Q. Tell me a little bit about the training that you've had, if any, to help you in your job duties as an investigator. A. When 1 was with the Department of Labor, I went to several trainings, both on-site and off-site, basic investigative procedures, investigative accounting, and pension and welfare plan training. That was for the Depaitment of Labor. For the Federal Trade Commission, I attended one training in Washington, D.C. several years ago, and I think that was a three-day training, and then 1 attended several law enforcement conferences. the training Q. Do you remember the substance of in D.C. during that three-day period you just described? A. It was about six or seven years ago, so I don't remember. Q. Okay. Let me just explore that further, mindful, if you don't remember, that's a perfectly For The Record, Inc. (301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 8 2 Daniel Chapter One, et 01.

(301) 870-8025 - www.ftrinc.net - (800) 921-5555 Exhibit F REPORT OF EXPERT WITNESS SALLY LaMONT In the Matter of Daniel Chapter One FTC Docket #9329 I. OUALIFICA TIONS As you wil see in my curriculum vitae, I am dually licensed in California as naturopathic doctor and acupuncturist. I graduated from the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon in 1981 and have been licensed in both Oregon and California to practice naturopathic medicine. I graduated from Emperor's College of Oriental Medicine in 1986 and have been licensed in both California and Oregon to practice acupuncture. I am a member of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians and the California Naturopathic Doctors Association and the California Society of Oriental Medicine and Acupuncture. 1 have practiced naturopathic medicine since 1981, working with ditt, nutritional supplements, botanical medicine, and mind-body treatments. Since being licensed as an acupuncturist in California in 1986, i have integrated acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine into my work. My practice focuses on helping people identify the root causes of their condition, removing the obstacles to cure, and developing personalized natural treatment protocols to resolve symptoms and promote health. i evaluate patients through a variety of state-of-the-art laboratory tests and integrate nutritional medicine with herbal medicine and acupuncture. Since 2005, I have been on the faculty of San Francisco State University's \"Institute for Holistic Healing Studies\" within their Department of Health Education. Over the past 4 years, her popular classes include \"Naturopathic Medicine and Personal Wellness\", \"Nutrition and Herbal Medicine\" and \"The Holistic Health Speakers Series\". In 1 998, I joined the board of directors of the California Naturopathic Doctors Association (CNDA). I took a brief sabbatical from my practice in May of 2000 to serve legislative campaign to as Executive Director of the CNDA and lead the successful license NDs in California. Passage of the Naturopathic Doctors Practice Act resulted in the creation of the Bureau of Naturopathic Medicine within California's Department of Consumer Affairs. Licensure of NDs provides Californians legal access to the care of licensed naturopathic doctors. The established scope of practice in California allows licensed NDs to serve as primary health care providers who treat acute and chronic conditions, in a prevention-oriented approach to healthcare. For the last 22 years, I have witnessed the tremendous value that changes in lifestyle, diet and the correct use of the nutritional and herbal supplements can provide. During this time in practice I have had the opportunity to provide adjunctive care to patients undergoing conventional cancer treatment, utilizing a range of dietary supplements and botanical medicines that were compatible with their conventional regimen. The body has immense self-healing capacities, which when properly supported can respond and heal from even serious diseases. In my experience, people receiving chemotherapy and radiation fare better, in both the short and long term, when they concurrently use natural therapies and lifestyle to mitigate the side -effects and support their overall health. An additional note: I have had the unusual experience of supporting my first husband, John LaMont, M.D., a family practitioner, through his death from non- Hodgkins lymphoma in 1992. John lived for 16 years with this cancer and as one of the first medical doctors interested in nutrition and natural therapies, he pursued virtually all known conventional and alternative treatment modalities. Together we explored a variety of nutritional interventions including the use of high dose intravenous vitamins, traditional Chinese medical options including acupuncture and variety of Chinese herbal medicine, A yurvedic medicine including working with Dr. Deepak Chopra in 1991, Dr. Stanislaus Burzynski's antineoplastic therapies and well as 4 rounds of conventional chemotherapy, radiation, monoclonal antibody therapies at Stanford and a bone marrow transplant. 2 Together, my education and these experiences give me a unique perspective as an expert witness in this case. II. SCOPE OF WORK I have been asked by the attorneys representing Daniel Chapter One to provide a opinions on the use of nutritional supplements and botanical medicines in the prevention and treatment of ilness, including but not limited to cancer. In addition, I was asked to review the evidence that exists regarding the mechanisms of action of the major constituents of DCO's cited products and to provide an opinion of that evidence for: \u00b7 \"ODU\" \u00b7 \"7 Herb Formula\" \u00b7 Compensation: $ 1 75/hour Prior expert testimony: see prior disclosures. III. MA TERIALS CONSIDERED To form my opinion, I have conducted literature searches on PubMed, that includes over 18 milion citations from MEDUNE and other life science journals for biomedical articles back to 1948. PubMed includes links to full text articles and other sites including the website of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Dr. Duke's Ethnobotanical and related resources. I also utilized Ooogle, and numerous web Phytochemical Database and the database of the American Botanical CounciL. I have In addition, I have drawn from my experience as a practicing naturopathic doctor and acupuncturist who utilizes dietary supplements and botanical medicines in daily practice. utilized several books, including Medicinal Plants of the World (Van Wyk and Wink). I have also reviewed the information provided to me by Daniel Chapter One, including the Daniel Chapter One Product Labels, Literature provided by Daniel Chapter 3 One, and the Summary of Medical Evidence provided Daniel Chapter One, all of which I understand have been provided to the FTC by Daniel Chapter One and/or its counseL. iv. SUMMARY OF OPINIONS ON THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine, advised his patients to \"Let your food be your medicine and your medicine be your food.\" Traditional and indigenous cultures naturally understood the connection between plants as both their food and their medicine. Today, there is a growing body of scientific evidence to substantiate the fact that the natural compounds present in plants act in multiple ways to support our innate homeostatic mechanisms, improve physiological function and reduce the expression of disease. \"Epidemiological studies consistently indicate that consumption of fruits and vegetables lowers cancer risk in humans and suggest that certain dietary constituents may be effective in preventing (colon) cancer. Plant-derived phenolic compounds manifest many beneficial effects and can potentially inhibit several stages of carcinogenesis in vivo.\" Carcinogenesis 2000 May; 21(5): 921-7. Many population studies have demonstrated lower incidences of several chronic degenerative diseases in cultures that eat a plant- based diet compared to the Western diet. Campbell, TC, The China Study (Dallas, TX: Ben Bella Books 2005); Cordain, L., \"Origins an Evolution of the Western Diet: Health Implications for the 2l( Century,\" American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 81, no.2 (2005): 341 -54. Humans have co-evolved with plants and we survive and thrive today because our bodies utilize plants for sustenance. The macronutrents, micronutrents and phytonutrients in food and phytochemicals in plants are biologically active compounds that influence our metabolism. A wealth of information on potential treatments for cancer and other conditions dwells in the clinical knowledge of traditional and indigenous cultures and their Material Medica. Herbalists have long known that herbs are an extension of food and have used the plants of this earth as medicines. They have prepared teas and concentrated extracts to potentiate the therapeutic effects of these phytomedicines. More recently, ethnobotanists and pharocognocists have worked to identify and catalogue these plants and their bioactive constituents. International researchers have begun the laborious process of isolating the biologically active 4 compounds and examining their mechanisms of action in order to determine their effect on various aspects of disease, especially carcinogenesis (i.e. the production of cancer or carcinoma). The biologically active compounds in plant medicines have been termed \"secondary metabolites\". Interestingly, the compounds produced by one species to protect them from their environment actually influence the metabolism of another species, and mimic the structure of our hormones, neurotransmitters and other aspects of our metabolism. These biologically active compounds have interacted with and shaped our physiological processes over milennia in a process termed \"evolutionary molecular modeling\". One of the advantages of using the phytonutrients present in food and the phytochemicals present in plants is that they exert their influences on multiple molecular targets. \"Secondary metabolites usually are multifunctional compounds because most of them carry more than one pharmacologically active chemical group. In addition, secondary metabolites usually occur in complex mixtures. In consequence, the extract of a medicinal plant affects more than one molecular target and it is likely that several targets are affected concomitantly when taking phytomedicines. In complex disorders, the application of such extracts increases the chances of \"hitting\" one or several relevant targets\". Van Wyk and Wink, Medicinal Plants oftlie World, Timber Press, Portland, Oregon 2003. Life\", oncologist David Servan- Schreiber, M.D., Ph.D., who is himself a two-time cancer survivor, suggests we can approach cancer in this way: \"There are certain circumstances under which these savage bands are disrupted and lose their virulence: (1) when the immune system mobilizes against them, (2) when the body refuses to create the inflammation without which they can neither grow nor invade new territories, or (3) when blood vessels refuse to reproduce and provide the supplies the cells need to grow. These are the mechanisms that can be reinforced to prevent the disease from taking hold. Once a tumor is installed, none of these natural defenses can replace chemotherapy-or radiotherapy. But they can be exploited, accompanying conventional treatments, to fully mobilze the body's resistance to cancer\". Dr. Servan-Schreiber goes on to elucidate the growing body of evidence that a In his recent book \"Anticancer -- A Way of 5 diet rich in chemoprotective plants can assist us in multiple ways in our fight to prevent and support the treatment of cancer. (Servan-Schreiber, D., Anticancer-A Way of Life, Viking Penguin Press, New York, New York, 2008). Scientific research, a selection of which follows in this report, demonstrates that the phytonutrients and phytochemicals present in plants have the capability to act at the precise molecular targets that scientists are seeking to affect with the new generation of biological response modifiers: . Anti-angiogenic effect: green tea and ginseng Some examples of how plant phytochemicals act as \"biological response modifiers\" to affect our physiological process are detailed here in this report: . Watercress: rich in glucosinolates that inhibits tumor growth, alters cell cycle regulation . Green tea (EGCG): signal transduction, inhibits COX2 and induces apoptosis, Knowledge of this kind of information should empower us to use these compounds as our food and as our medicine. The awareness of the powerful chemoprotective effects of plant foods and medicines should not influence patients with cancer and other serious diseases to abandon using the most effective methods that modern medicine has to offer. Furthermore, such knowledge does not diminish the need for further research but instead should hasten its pace. \"Phytomedicines often contain a mixture of substances that have additive or even synergistic effects, so that the health benefits are difficult to test or verify. Plant medicine 6 or phytochemicals may have subtle effects of several different biochemical pathways and receptors in the mind-body continuum that may all contribute directly and indirectly to restore equilibrium and balance. It is hard to dismiss medical claims of safety and efficacy when a plant medicine has been used in traditional cultures for centuries without evidence of serious side effects. Research results generated over the last few decades have given us a much better understanding of the scientific rationale behind many natural remedies.\" Van Wyk and Wink, Medicinal Plants of the World, Timber Press, Portland, Oregon 2003. Without a doubt, research is urgently needed to elucidate the mechanisms of action of phytonutrients and phytochemicals in the prevention and treatment of disease. The very complexity of these compounds presents immense challenges for research since they do not occur, nor do they act in isolation. One challenge with this approach is that it reduces the naturally occurring agent, which contains multiple compounds affecting multiple targets, to a single agent affecting a single target. While it is urgent that we understand the secondary metabolites and their actions, developing a new drug from that information is not the only worthwhile path. Adding to the challenge is the fact that research dollars are limited when natural agents can't be patented and their sale wil never recover the cost of the research. As pharmaceutical scientific research works to identify new potential drugs from natural agents, it tends to diminish or dismiss the therapeutic value of the former. Traditional use evidence does not replace human clinical trials. There are real limits to our current understanding of plant-based medicines that rests mostly on cultured cell lines and animal models. But many would argue that it is not essential that we wait to recommend the use of the original plant compound until all the evidence has been collected. The current situation is that cancer patients in particular are denied the opportunity to utilize natural therapies in a clinical setting until they have failed conventional therapies. In our rush to identify and utilize the most biologically active components of food and botanical medicines, we must respect the fact that for milennia mankind has used these foods and plants without evidence of serious harm. 7 V. ANAYLSIS AND FINDINGS \u00c1. GDU The four main ingredients in GDU are reviewed in this document. 1) Bromelain 2) Turmeric 3) a group of plant-derived proteolytic enzymes isolated from the stem and core of the pineapple. It has been used in the Chinese Materia Medica, other Asian cultures and by Western herbalists for a wide range of applications including but not limited to traumatic injury and arhritis and cancer. Clinical Summary: Bromelain has many in vitro and in vivo studies and its properties include: 1) the ability to interfere with growth of malignant cells; 2) inhibit platelet aggregation; 3) fibrinolytic activity; 4) anti-inflammatory 5) skin debridement properties. These biological functions of bromelain, a non-toxic compound, have therapeutic values in modulating a) tumor growth; b) blood coagulation; c) inflammatory changes; d) debridement of third degree burns; 3) enhancement of absorption of drugs.

It is part of the ginger family and has been used as an anti-inflammatory. It has been used for centuries in the Asian countries without any toxic effects. CUff Pharm Des. 2002; 8(19):1695-706 Clinical summary: A growing body of research suggests that curcumin has a potential for the prevention and treatment of cancer. Preclinical trials have shown that curcumin can both inhibit the formation of tumors in animal models and act on a variety of molecular targets involved in cancer development. In vitro studies have shown that curcumin induces apoptosis and some degree of selectivity of cancer cells. Clinical trials have revealed that curcumin is well tolerated and may produce antitumor effects in people with precancerous lesions or who are at high risk for developing cancer. This seems to indicate that curcumin is a pharmacologically safe agent that may be used in cancer chemoprevention and therapy. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown, however, that curcumin may produce toxic and carcinogenic effects under certain circumstances and specific conditions and may alter the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Parthenolide has been used in conjunction with Sulindac, an NSAID, in the treatment of pancreatic cancers, demonstrating decreased NFkappaB DNA binding and transcriptional activities in cells treated with the combination compared with the single agents, demonstrating cooperative targeting of the NF-KB pathway. These data provide preclinical support for a combined chemotherapeutic approach with NF-KB inhibitors and NSAIDs for the pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Mol Cancer Ther. Apr 2005;4(4):587-594 . Transcription factors such as NF-KB provide powerful targets for drugs to use in the treatment of cancer. In this report parthenolide (PT), a sesquiterpene lactone of herbal remedies such as feverfew (Tanacetum partheniuni) with NF-kB inhibitory activity, markedly increased the degree of human leukemia HL-60 cell differentiation when simultaneously combined with 5 nM lD:,25\u00ad dihydroxyvitamin Di (I,25-(OH)2D3). PT by itself did not induce HL-60 cell differentiation. In addition, These results indicate that PT strongly potentiates the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced HL-60 cell differentiation into monocytes via the inhibition of NF-KB activity and provide evidence that inhibition of NF-KB activation can be a pre-requisite to the efficient entry of promyelocytic leukemia cells into a 15 differentiation pathway. British Journal of Pharmacology (2002) 135, 1235-1244 \u00b7 Parthenolide is a major derived from (Tanacetum parthenium) with known anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, the anticancer potential of this compound was suggested. In this study, we determined the effect of parthenolide on proliferation of three human cancer cell lines: human lung carcinoma (A549), human medulloblastoma (TE67l), human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. Parthenolide inhibited proliferation of all three types of cancer cells (A549, TE67 1 , HT-29) and HUVEC with the following IC(50) values (in muM): 4.3,6.5, 7.0 and 2.8, respectively. Thus, the antiproliferative potential of parthenolide was confirmed. Pharmacol Rep. is an active sesquiterpene lactone present in a variety of medicinal herbs and is well known for its anti-inflammatory activity. The anti microtubular and antiproliferative influence pac1itaxel activity. The tubulin/microtubule system may represent a novel molecular target for parthenolide, to be utilized in developing new combinational anticancer strategies.

The glycoside form is readily available in dietary plants such as onions, apple, buckwheat, red wine and teas. Quercetin has a number of biological activities such as antioxidant, anti\u00ad inflammatory, and anti-allergy. Quercetin is being used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, cancer prevention and treatment. http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/htm1/69346.cfm Biological activities and known mechanism of action: Quercetin is a flavonoid molecule ubiquitous in nature. A number of its actions make it a potential anti-cancer agent, including cell cycle regulation, interaction with type II estrogen binding sites, and tyrosine kinase inhibition. Quercetin appears to be associated with little toxicity when administered orally or intravenously. Much in vitro and some preliminary human data indicate quercitin inhibits tumor growth. Altern Med Rev. 2000 Jun; 5(3): 196-200 What follows is an overview of the research on quercetin and cancer from Alternative Medicine Review 2000 Jun; 5(3): 196-200: 17 . Quercetin was found to down regulate expression of mutant p53 protein to nearly undetectable levels in human breast cancer cell lines. Lower concentrations gave less reduction. The inhibition of expression of p53 was found to arrest the cells in the G2\u00ad M phase of the cell cycle. . Quercetin has been found to inhibit the expression of the p2l-ras oncogene in cultured colon cancer cell lines. Mutations of ras proto-oncogenes are found in over 50% of colon cancers, as well as many other tumor types. . Radiotherapy: Quercetin showed a significant but mild enhancement of the cytotoxic effect of radiation on rat hepatoma cells when added to the medium. A human study showed topical and oral administration of quercetin to reduce skin damage during radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancers. . Chemotherapy: Quercetin has been shown to increase the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo in mice. An in vitro study using human ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines found that addition of quercetin to cisplatin caused a potentiation of the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin . Quercetin has been shown in vitro to protect normal renal tubular cells from cisplatin toxicity. Adverse reactions: Human studies have not shown any adverse effects associated with oral administration of quercetin in a single dose of up to 4,000 mg (Eur J Clin Pharmacol 1975; 9:229-234) or after one month 1999; and Bromelain: May assist the absorption of Quercetin in the intestine.

The Healing Power of Press, New York, 1995, pp.315-20) Farnsworth and colleagues reviewed data on an Eleutherococcus senticosus root extract administered to over 2,100 human subjects to assess the adaptogenic effects of ginseng and concluded that it: 1. Increased ability of humans to withstand adverse physical conditions (heat, noise, motion, workload increase, exercise and decompression), and 2. Increase mental alertness and work output, and 3. Improved quality of work produced under stressful conditions, and athletic performance. Farnsworth and colleagues reviewed data on an Eleutherococcus senticosus root extract administered to over 2,200 human subjects to assess its adaptogenic effect in disease states and concluded that it appears to be effective in: 1. Atherosclerotic conditions in that it can lower serum cholesterol levels, reduce blood pressure and eliminate angina symptoms in human subjects; 2. Improving kidney function and regulating blood pressure in patients with acute kidney infection 3. Improved sense of well-being of psychological complaints (insomnia, hypochondriasis, neuroses) possibly through regulation of biogenic amine content in the brain. 25 Economic and Medical Plant Research i , i 56-215.

Biologically active constituents and proposed mechanisms of action: Contains 47 biologically active chemicals (Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases) accessed 1/09. The most for cancer is phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC). Watercress may have exceptionally good anticarcinogenic potential as it combines a potent inhibitor of Phase 1 enzymes (PEITC) with at least three inducers of phase II enzymes (PElTC, 7-methylsulfinylheptyl ITC and 27 8-methylsulfinyloctyl ITC. These compounds act at three stages of carcinogenesis in that they: 1. Inhibit carcinogen activation 2. Induce phase II enzymes and enhance excretion of the potential carcinogens and 3. Induce apoptosis via activation of protein kinase pathway. The putative anticarcinogenic activity of ITC is consistent with the results of epidemiological studies, which have suggested a reduction in cancer risk through the consumption of cruciferous vegetables. Carcinogenesis. 2000 21(1 1) pp. 1983-88 PEITe: PEITC enzymes in the liver, lung and nasal mucosa and is especially effective in inhibiting the cytochrome p450 dependent oxidation of NNK in the lung and NDMA in the liver of rats.

WHEY PROTEIN Whey Protein: Whey is a co-product of cow's milk in the manufacture of cheese and in recent years has become a functional food. The two primary sources of protein in milk are the caseins and whey. After processing occurs, the caseins are the proteins responsible for making curds, while the whey remains in an aqueous environment. and minerals. Today whey is a popular dietary protein supplement purported to provide antimicrobial activity, immune modulation, improved muscle strength and body composition, and prevention of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Alt Med Rev. 2008 Dee; 4(13); 341-7 Whey Protein Constituents: Whey protein contains all the essential amino acids in higher concentrations than vegetable protein sources. They are efficiently absorbed and utilized relative to free amino acid solutions. Whey proteins have a high concentration of Branched chain amino acids (BCAA): isoleucine, leucine, valine, which are important factors in tissue growth and repair. Whey proteins are also rich in the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine, which enhance immune function through intracellular conversion to glutathione, one of the most important antioxidants in the cell.

J Nulr 1985;114:1403-8 Clinical indications: Whey's amino acid profile makes it useful for enhancing body composition, supporting protein synthesis and building lean body mass. For these reasons it has been used in patients with diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, to support pediatric bowel health, and to improve glutathione levels in individuals infected with HIV and in cancer. Ali Med Rev. 2008 Dec; 4( 13); 341-7 Whey protein concentrates have been researched extensively with respect to cancer prevention and treatment, and glutathione stimulation is thought to be the primary immune-modulating mechanism. Alt Med Rev. 2008 Dec; 4(13); 341-7 30 The amino acid precursors to glutathione in why might increase glutathione levels in tissues, stimulate immunity and detoxify potential carcinogens.

In an animal model of colon cancer, animals given whey components demonstrated significantly lower incidence of tumors and fewer ability to reduce induction of 478-85 Side Effects and Toxicity: Individuals with known allergy to milk may not tolerate why, but many dairy sensitive individuals find that casein is the culprit and not whey, especially if it is hydrolyzed and therefore less allergenic. Most whey proteins have been processed to remove lactose and so those who are lactose intolerant may tolerate hydrolyzed whey protein. Alt Med Rev. huang qi (pin yin) Historical use: Astragalus has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for thousands of years as an immune stimulant and qi tonic (adaptogen). Clinical Summary: Astragalus has been used to support and enhance immune function and is stil widely used in China and by acupuncturists for chronic immune conditions like chronic hepatitis and as an adjunctive therapy in cancer. Astragalus extracts have been shown to possess cytostatic properties, inhibit tumor growth and in vitro, animal and anecdotal human data show that astragalus reduces immune suppression resulting from chemotherapy. Astragalus-based herb formulas may enhace the effect of platinum-based chemotherapy. http://www .mskcc .org/mskcc/html/69 i 28 .cfm 31 Biochemically active constituents and known mechanisms of action: To date, 38 biologically active constituents of Astragalus membranaceus have been isolated. The most biologically active are the as immunomodulating agent in treating immunodeficiency diseases and to alleviate the adverse effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, the anti-carcinogenic effects of Astragalus saponin extract were investigated in HT-29 human colon cancer cells and tumor xenograft. Our findings have shown that Astragalus saponins (AST): o inhibits cell proliferation through accumulation in S phase and G2/M arrest, with concomitant suppression of p2l expression and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity. o promotes apoptosis in HT - 29 cells through caspase 3' activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, which is indicated by DNA fragmentation and nuclear chromatin condensation. o demonstrates an anti-tumorigenic effects in vivo, of which the reduction of tumor volume as well as pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in HT\u00ad 29 nude mice xenograft are comparable with that produced by the conventional chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracIl (5-FU). / o reduced the side effects (body weight drop and mortality) associated with the drug combo 5-FU and oxaliplatin are not induced by AST. o These results indicate that AST could be an effective chemotherapeutic agent in colon cancer treatment, which might also be used as an adjuvant in combination with other orthodox chemotherapeutic drugs to reduce the side effects of the latter compounds: Carcinogenesis 2007 28(6):1347-1355; doi: 1 O.i 093/carcin/bgI238 \u00b7 A partially purified fraction (F3) with an estimated molecular weight of 20,000 to 25,000 derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Astragalus membranaceus, was found to possess a potent immunorestorative activity in vitro. 32 These data indicate that F3 administration markedly enhances the rats' ability to reject the xenogeneic graft and therefore possesses a strong immune potentiating activity in vivo. These preclinical data also provide the rational basis for the use of extracts of Astragalus membranaceus in phase I clinical trials among patients suffering from iatrogenic or inherent immune deficiency states. J Clin Lab Immunol. 1988 Mar;25(3): 125-9. . Meta-analysis: Astragalus shown have immunologic benefits by stimulating macrophage and natural kiler cell activity and inhibiting T-helper cell type 2 cytokines. Many published studies have assessed the use of Astragalus and other Chinese herbal medicines in combination with chemotherapy. We sought to evaluate evidence from randomized trials that Astragalus-based Chinese herbal medicine combined with platinum-based chemotherapy (versus platinum-based chemotherapy alone) improves survival, increases tumor response, improves performance status, or reduces chemotherapy toxicity. Results: Of 1,305 potentially relevant publications, 34 randomized studies representing 2,815 patients met inclusion criteria. Twelve studies (n = 940 patients) reported reduced risk of death at 12 months (risk ratio (RR) = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.87). Thirty studies (n = 2,472) reported improved tumor response data (RR = 1.34; 95% CL, 1.24 to 1.46). In subgroup analyses, Jin Fu Kang in two studies (n = 221 patients) reduced risk of death at 24 months (RR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.68) and in three studies (n = 41 1) increased tumorresponse (RR = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.53). Ai Di injection (four studies; n = 257) stabilized or improved Karnofsky performance status (RR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.46). Conclusion: Astragalus-based Chinese herbal medicine may increase effectiveness of platinum-based chemotherapy when combined with chemotherapy. These results require confirmation with rigorously controlled trials.

Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies indicate strong chemopreventive effects for green tea and its constituents against cancers of various organs. Biochemically active constituent and proposed mechanisms of action: The polyphenolic Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) is a well-known chemoprevention factor that triggers apoptosis in cells going through the p53 dependent pathway. Cancer Res 2008;68(11);4150-62 34 . EGCG and EGC are capable of altering AhR transcription and are responsible for most, if not all, of the AhR antagonist activity of GTE, thus offering an insight to how it prevents tobacco related carcinogenesis. Chern Res Toxicol. 2003; 1 6(7);865-872 ECGC inhibits the growth of human squamous carcinoma, breast carcinoma and colon carcinoma cells and is associated with rapid inhibition of activation of RTKs,EGRF, HERR2 and HER3 inhibition of activation or the expression of several downstream signaling molecules involved in cell proliferation and survivaL. Therefore, ECGC or Poly E may be useful when used alone or in combination with other agents in the prevention and treatment of colon and other types of human cancer. AACR ConfFront Cane Res Prevent. Nov 12-15,2006 ECGC inhibits cancer cell growth through the inhibition of lGF- 1 and VEGF receptors, inhibits the Ras/MAPK and P13K/Akt signaling pathways, thereby modulating the expression of target genes, which are associated with induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cancer cells.

Sei. 2008, Volume 9(6), Page 1034-1049 Adverse reactions: Nausea and GI upset have been reported Herb/Drug Interactions: theoretically, large amounts of green tea may inhibit Vitamin K absorption, thus antagonizing the effects of anticoagulants; may reduce absorption of atropine; may reduce bioavailability of yin); Acanthopanax senticosus Historical use: Eleutherococcus senticosus has been used for thousands of years in the Traditional Chinese Materia Medica as a kidney tonic to increase longevity, improve general health and appetite. In 1958, the Russian scientist Brekhman coined the term \"adaptogen\" as a substances that 1) must be innocuous and cause minimal disorders in the physiological functions of an organism, 2) must have a non-specific action (i.e., it 35 should increase the resistance to adverse influences by a wide range of physical, chemical and biochemical factors), and 3) usually has a normalizing action irespective of the direction of the pathological state (alterative action). The Healing Power of Herbs, Murray; Three Rivers Press, New York,1995,pp.315-20) Farnsworth and colleagues reviewed data on an Eleutherococcus senticosus root extract administered to over 2,100 human subjects to assess the adaptogenic effects of ginseng and concluded that it: 1. Increased ability of humans to withstand adverse physical conditions (heat, noise, motion, workload increase, exercise and decompression), and 2. Increase mental alertness and work output, and 3. Improved quality of work produced under stressful conditions, and athletic performance. Farnsworth and colleagues reviewed data on an Eleutherococcus senticosus root extract administered to over 2,200 human subjects to assess its adaptogenic effect in disease states and concluded that it appears to be effective in: 1. Atherosclerotic conditions in that it can lower serum cholesterol levels, reduce blood pressure and eliminate angina symptoms in human subjects; 2. Improving kidney function and regulating blood pressure in patients with acute kidney infection 3. Improved sense of well-being of psychological complaints (insomnia, hypochondriasis, neuroses) possibly through regulation of biogenic amine content in the brain. Economic and Medical Plant Research i, i 56-215, Farnsworth, 1985 The Healing Power of Herbs, Murray; Three Rivers Press, New York, 1995, pp.3 i 5-20) Biologically active constituents and proposed mechanisms of action: To date, at least 51 biologically active constituents in Eleutherococcus have been identified (Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Database) accessed 1/09. The main active constituents are the eleutherosides, though very little current research is available. Below are some of the higWights: Eleutherococcus senticosus demonstrated immunomodulatory properties (enhanced 36 the cellular response of the mouse immunological system (chemokinetic activity of mice spleen cells, GvH reaction), as well as a stimulatory effect of Eleutherococcus on the humoral response (antibody production) in mice. Pol Journal Vet Science 2003;6(3 Suppl):37-9. Eleutherococcus senticosus, as part of a formula (AdMax) was evaluated for its effect on ovarian cancer patients. In patients who took AdMax,the mean numbers of 4 T cell subclasses were increased, the mean amounts of IgG andIgM were incrased and the results suggest that the combination of extracts from adaptogenic plants may boost the suppressed immunity in ovarian cancer patients who are subject to chemotherapy. Phytotherapy Res. 2006 May; 20(5): 424-5 Standardized extracts of Eleutherococcus senticosus at generally recommended doses for over-the\u00ad counter use are unlikely to alter the disposition of co-administered medications primarily dependent of CY2D6 or Eleutherococcus senticosus extract was applied to cells in culture resulting in a slight radioprotective effect. American Journal Chinese Medicine. 1981 (9) 48-56 . Eleutherococcus senticosus provided anti-proliferative effects against LI210 murine leukemia cells and suggests that it may be useful for reducing the concentration of conventional anti-metabolites used for their anti-proliferative effects on tumor cells. Journal may have contributed to the anti-fatigue action, recovery of the reduction of NK activity and inhibition of corticosterone elevation induced by swimming stress. Journal of Ethnopharmacology. 2004 Dec;95(203 ):447 -53 Clinical summary: Although initial reports from the Soviet Union and reviews of that literature by Farnsworth suggested therapeutic value of Eleutherococcus senticosus as an adaptogen, very little current research has been done to substantiate those findings. It is now being recommended that the term \"adaptogen\" be discontinued and further research 37 be done on this plant to confirm potential therapeutic value in these areas: Anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, immunostimulatory, Dec;95(203 ):447-53 Adverse effects: toxicity studies in animals demonstrated that 33% ethanol extract of E. senticosus is virtually non-toxic; it is very well-tolerated in humans and side-effects are quite minimal; very high doses may produce insomnia, irritabilty, melancholy and anxiety. Economic and Medical Plant Research 1,156-215. Farnsworth, i 985The Healing Power of Herbs, Murray; Three Rivers Press, New York. 1995,pp.315-20) Herb/drug interactions: none discovered D. \"BioShark\" History of use: In 1971, Judah Folkman, MD published his work on angiogenesis and cancer in the New England Journal of Medicine. Robert Langer, PhD at MIT followed with the observation that bovine carilage could inhibit neovascularization of solid tumors. Dr. John Prudden demonstrated that bovine cartilage could inhibit the in vitro growth of osteosarcoma and human myeloma cultured cells. Dr. Prudden developed Catrix, a bovine tracheal cartilage, and began treating end-stage cancer patients in 1972. This therapy exerted a major inhibitory effect on a variety of cancers but did not eliminate them completely. In 1983, Langer began work comparing shark cartilage to bovine cartilage, reporting the same amount of shark cartilage contained 1000 times the quantity of anti-angiogenic factor as did bovine carilage. Initial studies in mice by William Lane, PhD showed dramatic results of a decrease in tumor weight of 40% in the treated animals compared to a 2.5 fold increase in tumor weight of the untreated group. Dr. Lane outlined a case report of 8 humans in stage II and iv cancer utilizing 30 grams/day of shark cartilage taken as enemas, which produced very encouraging results. A human clinical trial of 29 patients suffering from stage iv and V cancers that had failed conventional therapies was begun. At the end of 16 weeks 38 of rectal enemas at a dose of one gram of powdered shark cartilage per 2 pounds of body weight, some patients had marked reduction in tumor size and reduced vascularization of the tumor tissue and tissue adjacent to the tumor. Many patients reported a reduction in pain and an improved sense of well-being. Townsend Letter for Doctors: Review article Aug/Sepl. 1994 In 1994, a Phase 2 human clinical controlled tral was sanctioned by the FDA and conducted by Dennis Miller, MD et al at Cancer Treatment Centers of America. The results of this 60 patient study concluded that under the specific conditions of this study, shark cartilage as a single agent was inactive in patients with advanced-stage cancer and had no salutary effect on the quality of life. J Clin Oncol. 1998 Nov;16(I 1):3649-55. The challenge with this and other human clinical trials in cancer patients is that the only candidates for therapy are those who are end-stage and have failed conventional treatments. This obviously eliminates candidates who have a strong and functional immune system. In 2008, researchers isolated two partially purified anti-angiogenesis proteins from shark cartilage that were demonstrated to block microvessel sprouting in the collagen- embedded rat aortic ring assay in vitro and inhibition of capilary sprouting in the CAM assay in vivo. Bioscience Reports (2008) 28, (15-21) Cartilage in general, and shark cartilage in particular, have demonstrated inhibition of angiogenesis in cell cultures and animal studies. The shark cartilage that has been used in most studies was a highly purified protein derivative. The particularly high doses used, distinct fishy flavor and difficulty with routes of administration present unique challenges with this therapy in humans. 39 VI. SUMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Based on my experience and expertse, as well as the reseach cited above, 1 hold the following opinions: A. There is a reasonable basis to claim that the ingredients of GDU contan bromelain, a source of natural proteolytc enzymes from the pineapple, which helps digest unwanted proteins. GDU also contans tueric, feverfew and quercitin, which help to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Next, it is reasonable to claim that these ingredients as a whole may be used as an adjunct to cancer therapy, and that the ingredients possess a wide ran.ge of actions as anti-inflammatory agents. B. There is a reasonable basis to claim that the ingredients of 7 Herb Fonnula fight tumor formation, and fight pathogenic bacteria. C. There is a reasonable basis to claim that the ingredients of BioMixx boost the immune system, build lean boy mass and support healing. It is also reasonable to claim that these ingredients assist the boy in fighting cancer, cachexia and in healing the destrctive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments.\" D. There is a reasonable basis for the claims that pure skeleta tissue of sharks provides a protein that inhibits angiogenesis - the formation of new bloo vessels. It is also reasonable to claim that angiogenesis has been demonstrted to inhibit tumor growth in some studies. Febru 4, 2009 ~1\u00a3~Nb~ 40 Exhibit G REPORT OF EXPERT WITNESS JAMES DUKE James A.

There is a reasonable basis for the claims th\u00e1t the ingredients of GDU \"contains natual proteolytic enzymes (from pineapple source bromelain) to help digest protein-\u00ad even that of unwanted tumors and cysts. This formula also helps to relieve pain and heal inflammation. . aDU is also used for. . .and as an adjunct to cancer therapy.

There is a reasonable basis for the claims that the ingredients of BioMixx \"boosts the immune system, ... to allow for natural healing. It is used to assist the body in fighting cancer and in healing the destrctive effects of radiation and chemotherapy treatments.\" V. ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS I base my conclusions, from my experience and knowledge, on three analytical points: First, herbal based and nutritional food information can be drawn from the Bible. Second, herbs, including those from the Bible provide help to the health of people that can be as good as or superior to help provided by pharaceuticals. Third, significant science, as set out below, supports herbal use, and a system- which I call a third arm to a standard pharmaceutical study-could establish the value of herbs to the scientific gold standard urged by conventional science.. Without an approach like the third ar approach, it wil never be possible to find sufficient resources to run classical pharmaceutical studies on whole herbs, let alone to evaluate the hundreds of single chemical entities in each herb. 3 In the meantime the public should not be denied access to the information available that certain herbs have credible evidence that they contribute to healing, even for conditions such as cancer. In the absence of resources for massive studies we have to rely on the less expensive science set out below. 1. The Science of Herbs: I begin with the third point first. Here are three ways I use to establish the effcacy of an herb: one is the Multiple Activities Menu's (MAM's), the second is Indications Evaluations (IE's ), and the third is 60 abstracts in PubMed. I am only presenting ways one and two here. A. The MA is a listing, recognized worldwide, which I have created and maintained for over 20 years on the United States Departent of Agriculture (USDA) website. Information is put into the website about the relationship between an herb and a thecondition.-in this case cancer. Then the information is drawn out for a review of curent scientific status of the herb in question. The following are Multiple Activities Menu's (MAM's) for 16 DCO herbs and their relation to cancer as recorded in the USDA website. . These can be done online at my USDA website. DANIEL CHAPTER ONE HERBS MAM's: MA: Claw) for Cancer (79/31=2.55) the \"I\" is the number of cancer affecting The number on the right hand side of aspects ofthe herb being evaluated. the MAM's for DCO herbs, such as See Appendix II for detailed presentation of the 16 DCOthe following one for Turmeric, presented as an example. (Tureric, one of herbs, would certainly be in my meals were I subject to cancer, and I am genetically targeted for colon cancer. Tureric's curcumin is probably better than Celebrex, which like other synthetic COX-2-I's was once touted off-label for the prevention of colon cancer. There are 66 indications of Turmeric affecting cancer in this MAM. Some are bolded.) Curcuma longa (Turmeric) the top 5 medicinal spices, with some anticancer activities, proven to my(One Evaluations (IE's) Summary: Review of Indications of 16DCO herb indications to pharmaceutical Herbs. (See Appendix II for comparison of indications) Actaea (Cimicifuga) racemosa (Black Cohosh). Widely sold and respected for menopausal difficulties. * Allum sativum (Garlic): My most important herbal medicine, useful at preventing all the major kilers and sepses. Ananas comosus China as an anticancer immunomodulator. Camella sinensis (Green Tea): Food faracy item widely and scientifically promoted for many indications. the top 5 medicinal spices, with some anticancer activities, proven to my satisfaction. Eleutherococcus senticosus (Eleuthero) Sold widely as an alternative to ginseng, adaptogenic tonic. Glycine max (Soybean): Studied by the late Judah Folkman and widely sold as a food farmacy item, in part for its mix of antiangiogenic isoflavones most crucifers (members of Brassicaceae), this nutritious edible species is properly touted as a cancer preventive. Rheum palmatum (Chinese Rhubarb); Sold as laxative and in Essiac formula, touted for cancer. Rumex acetosella (Sheep sorrel) Sold in Essiac formula, touted for cancer. Smilax arstolochiifolia (Sarsaparila) Widely sold, e.g., for Lyme Disease; contains compounds which can be converted to hormones. Tanacetum parhenium (Feverfew) I think itsabout as good for migraine pharmaceutical sumatriptan. Ulmus rubra (Slippery Elm) Sold in Essiac formula, touted for cancer. Uncaria tomentosa (Cats Claw) Famed immUlomodulator from Latin America; proofs possibly more promotional than scientific. 8 the new pharmaceuticals wil be relabeled (with stronger warings) or parially or completely recalled within a decade. Meanwhile, more expensive pharmaceuticals wil continue to cause many more deaths than are caused by the safe herbs we are led to believe are dangerous. They are not! Check the Bextra, Celebrex, and Vioxx, and, let me predict, soon-to-be-heard statin, stories (three close friends of mine, too old to be worried about cholesterol, have been hospitalized from statins) and head Half of counts of iatrogenic fatalities. The Null Numbers: The total number of anual iatrogenic deaths in America is 783,936. (Null et aI, 2003). Remember, pharaceuticals have been with us less than 150 years. If our ancestors left Africa via the Holy Land 2000 years ago (for faith-based literalists), or maybe a milion years ago (for the less literal), then our genes, tracing back to our AfricanHoly Land ancestors, have had at least 10 times more temporal experience with Biblical herbs (e.g., cinnamon, coriander, garlic, grape, mint, milk thistle, myrrh, olive, onion, saffron, tureric, and the like). Pharmaceuticals and synthetic food additives are relatively new to our genes. Our bodies have had thousands, perhaps milions, of years of evolutionary experience with the thousands of phytochemicals in these species. Our them. In many cases, by my educated guess, the body has evolved homeostatic mechanisms for maintaining homeostatic balances for these phytochemicals. Our bodies can sequester them from our dietary milieux if we need bodies may even require many of we do not. We can prove this for simple elemental chemicals like selenium and zinc. I believe it is the case that homeostatic balancing activities exist for hundreds of many long-familiar dietary components. We just, as Congress, signed an RDA for choline in the last decade. The farther we get from our Paleolithic diet, and them, excreting them if 9 (more importantly) the more synthetic pharaceuticals and food additives we ingest, the more liable we are to suffer imbalances. It's not only food additives that hurt us; it is the subtractives as welL. The subtractive phytochemicals are those important nutrients reduced or lost in food processing: nutrients which were plentiful in the natural grain, including \"Of the 12 micro vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, folic acid, E and the minerals iron, zinc, copper, manganese and selenium, less than 30%, and in some cases less than 10%, have been retained in the wheat products we eat. (Levin, 1996)\" Restoring chemical balance may require getting back to basics, those primitive Paleolithic foods rich in phytonutrients. At the same time, we should reduce over- processed nutrent-poor junk foods, avoiding additives and even pharaceuticals where possible and plausible. I'm not saying there is no place for pharaceuticals. But I wil say that in many cases there are balanced Biblical foods that are pharacologically competitive with unbalancing pharmaceuticals, and these food fan11aceuticals should be drgs of first resort, and the pharaceuticals last resort. And if you believe in me and my Biblical food farmaceutical shotgun more than you believe in your allopath and her/his expensive pharaceutical silver bullets, there's a better chance that my natural approach will help you. Believing is half the cure. Can you the believe in a company whose $2-bilion-a-year drug was shown in JAMA (Joural of American Medical Association) back in 2002 to be no better than placebo for major depression? Can you believe that now, three years later, that company stil has the premier lead-off ad page for the JAMA, touting the $2-bilion-a-year drug as so trsted, with Biblical walnut oil andso reliable, so effcacious? I suspect you'd be better off 10 Biblical saffron, nourishing AND medicating your body, attenuating the depression with few or no consequential side effects. If you count all the possible side effects reported in the fine print ofthat ad for the $2-bilion-a-year pharmaceutical, there are more than a hundred. When that study was printed back in 2002 showing the pharaceutical no better than placebo, almost nobody heard that the drug failed too. The news was instead blaring out \"St. Johnswort no better than placebo.\" True, S1. Johnswort (SJW) fared no better than placebo in this clinical comparson ofSJW, Zoloft, and placebo. But that's the half of the story that Joan Q. Public heard a thousand times, while maybe once or twice hearing that the pharmaceutical failed too. Do I think there is a pharmaceutical! PhDA/press conspiracy? I wil say that they are all singing the same song, and the song is wrong, and is hurting Americans. Their monotonous song drives American consumers from the safer food, herb and spice farmaceuticals to the more expensive, more dangerous synthetic pharmaceuticals. All this at the expense of our health and the health of our planet. Even our rivers and lakes, and consequently our water supply, are now cocktails of pharmaceutical residues. 2. Some Biblical Herbs and Spices: Potential Alternatives to Pharaceuticals list (for more examples see Appendix IV) of long- known plants that by some definitions might be considered spices or culinary herbs. I also list here a disease or malady in which they have shown some promise, and a competitive pharaceutical for that disease. I am campaigning for a third arm mandate, The following is a partial empowering a comparson of a thd, herbal, arm with the pharmaceutical in any new clinical trials. Until such clinical trials, we don't really know that the pharaceutical is 11 best. . The herb is almost always safer and cheaper. Pharmaceuticals and/or iatrogenesis (medically-caused adverse effects) related to conventional treatments kil 100,000 to 740,000 Americans a year, according to some published sources.

'Jim' Due urhy rfg Q \u00a1)dJ CV: Born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1929, James A. \"Jim\" Duke is a Phi Beta Kappa PhD (botany, 1961) graduate of the University of North Carolina. Jim, following military service, undertook postdoctoral activities at Washington University and Missouri Botanical Garden in S1. Louis, Missouri. There he began studies of neotropical ethnobotany, his overriding interest to this day. From 1963 to 1965, Duke was ecologist with the USDA (Beltsville, Maryland), joining Battelle Columbus Laboratories (1965-71) for ecological and ethnobotanical studies in Panama and Colombia. During this formative period, Duke lived with various ethnic groups, closely observing their deep dependence on forest products. The first of some twenty books, his Isthmian Ethnobotanical Dictionary catalogs hundreds of Isthmian plants and their uses. Rejoining USDA in 1971, Duke had assignments relating to crop diversification, medicinal plants, and energy plant studies in developing countries. A popular lecturer on the subjects of ethnobotany, herbs, medicinal plants, and new crops and their ecology, he has taped dozens of TV and radio shows. The National Agriculture Library has a video history of Dr. Duke's career. Duke grows hundreds of interesting plants on his six-acre farmeUe (Green Farmacy Garden) with his wife and illustrator, Peggy. On Sept. 30, 1995, he retired after - 30 years with the USDA.Before retiring, Dr. Duke brought his renowned ethnobotanical and phytochemicial database online at USDA. It is now, in Duke's retirement, one of the most frequently consulted areas of the USDA website. Since retiring Dr. Duke has served for five years as Senior Science Adviser to Nature's Herbs. and with AIlHerb.Com Since 2001, he has been a distinguished herbal lecturer with the Tai Sophia Healing Institute, Laurel MD. USDA DATABASE hUo://ww.ars-qrin.qov/duke/; Pleiotropy Database Multiple Activities Menu Duke has already doubled the raw data content in the add-on module that he maintains for private licensure. The database is especially useful for determining biological activities and healing potentials of food ands herbs. There is a growing interest in his data from people in companies and organizations including: Proctor & Gamble Corporation, New Chapter, Herbal Science, GAIA Herbs, MD Anderson Cancer Institute and many others. Fluent in Spanish, Duke has studied and/or lectured widely, concentrating on tropical ecology, medical botany, and crop diversification. Widely travelled, Duke \"cut his tropical eye teeth\" in Panama where he was resident from 1966-68. While working on an encyclopedia of economic plants, he has collaborated with the National Cancer Institute on both their AIDS and cancer- screening programs and their Designer Food Program (to prevent cancer). His data bases on the ecology, nutritional content, folk medicinal uses and chemical constituents of economic plants are being widely utilized. Duke's major goal lately is to reverse the disdain for alternative medicines in the US, where, as in the Third World, a growing percentage of people can no longer afford nor trust pharmaceuticals. Duke has a contagious interest in natural foods and nutritional approaches to preventive medicine. Between 1990-1992, Duke was advising the Designer Food Program of the NIH, then under the aegis of Dr. Herb Pierson. Lately Duke has been very active in ecotourism in Latin America and is teaching such themes as renewable rainforest products in the rainforests of Amazonian Peru. He has become an expert in the field of non-timber forest products. In 2008, Duke has already led trips to the rain forests of Costa Rica and Peru, along with numerous honoraria speeches (see below). With an aggregate of more then a decade in Latin America, Duke has traversed parts of Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guadelupe, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. In Asia, he has had lengthy visits in China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and quick looks at Burma, Japan, Laos and Vietnam. In the Middle East, he has worked in Iran, Israel, Kuwait, and Syria, with quick looks at the Mediterranean countries of Egypt, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain.

Introduction On November 17,2005, the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") held a public meeting to present findings of five recent studies of consumer perceptions of qualifed and unqualified health claims for conventional foods and dietar supplements. In the meeting announcement, FDA also sought public comment on (1) available research and the implications of the research for furer consumer studies and (2) other approaches that might convey effectively to consumers the strngt of science supportg health claims. i The staff of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Economics, Bureau of Consumer Protection, and Offce of Policy Planing (\"FTC staf') is pleased to submit this comment in response to FDA's request for public comment. In this comment, the FTC staff identifies five findings from the studies that may help guide future research in this area. These findings are: (1) Curent FDA language for qualified and unqualified claims does not communcate the intended levels of scientific certainty to consumers; (2) The curent language the FDA uses to communicate an unqualified Significant Scientific Agreement claim does not convey strong scientific certainty to consumers; (3) The FTC staff s research indicates that language may be craftd that wil differentiate clearly among differig levels of scientific cerinty (4) The \"report card\" fonnats perform consistently well in rankng scientific certainty; and (5) Consumer interpretation of the individual qualifed claims that researchers have tested vares widely. The comment then suggests several ways in which researchers might build on these findings. Assessing Consumer Perceptions of Health Claims; Public Meetig; Request for Comments, Docket No. 2005N-0413, 70 Fed. Reg. (Oct. 19,2005) (hereinafter\"FDA Public Meeting\"). . i FTC-Dca 0871 A. The FDA Approach to Regulating Qualified Health Claims The FDA currently evaluates the scientific evidence supportng health claims in food and dietary supplement labeling pursuant to an interim process using a four level system.2 Level \"A\" health claims are unqualifed claims for which there is \"significant scientific ageement\" (\"SSA\") Levels \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\" claims correspond to qualifed health claims for which the level of comfort regadig the scientific support for a given diet-disease relationship is progressively weaker.3 that the diet-disease relationship is valid. 2 FDA statutes and regulations permt health claims on labels for both food and they are supported by \"significant scientific agrement\" (\"SSA\") among qualified experts based on publicly available scientific evidence. 21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(B); 21 dieta supplements if C.F.R. 101. 14(a)(I) and (2). In 1999, the U.S. Cour of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit considered a constitutional challenge to the FDA's denial of four health claims for dieta supplements that were not supported by SSA. See Pearson v. Shalala, 164 F.3d 650 (D.C. Cir. 1999). The FDA asserted that it could prohibit these claims because they had the potential to mislead consumers, but the cour rejected this argument. The cour held tht the FDA had violated the First Amendment by denyig these claims without proof that disclosures would not have suffced to cure the potential for d~ception. After the Pearson decision and another related case, Whitaker v. Thompson, 248 F.Supp.2d 1 (D.D.C. 2002)), the FDA adopted an interi process that allows marketers to convey trthful, non-misleading health claims for both foods and dietary supplements that indicate the level of scientific support for the claim.

The FTC enforces the Federal Trnde Commission Act,! 1 which prohibits deceptive or unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce.12 A high priority of the FTC is briging law enforcement actions to prevent deceptive claims in health-related advertising.13 The Commission strves to achieve this goal in a manner that will not impose unduly burdensome AFFAIRS 27 (2005).

Likewise, FTC staff has studied the effect of advertising regulation on consumers and advertising in communicating health information to consumers.16 As noted above, since i 998 FTC staff has conducted extensive consumer survey research on qualified health clams, includig advertising copy tests on over 1,300 consumers, to competition1S and has examined the role of study which tyes of qualifying language most effectvely convey limitations in scientific support for diet-disease relationships. 14 See, e.g., FTC Policy Statement Regarding Advertising Substantiation, appended to Thompson Medical Co., 104 F.T.C. 648, 839 (1984) (substantiation factors include benefits of a trth claim and costs of a false claim, thus balancing the goal of preventing deception with the need to ensure access to truthl information and vigorous competition).

Based on its experience and research in this area, FfC staff submits this comment in response to FDA's request for public comment on the implications of available research for futue research on qualified health claims. The comment first presents what we believe to be principal findings ofthe research presented at the November meeting and then discusses possible ways in which fuer research on health claims might build on these findings. Finally, FTC staff III. Principal Findings of Research Presented at the Public Meeting Our review of the five studies presented at the public meeting has identified at least five findings that may have importt implications for futue research. Many of these findings are common to most or even all ofthe studies, and therefore should be considered robust. Finding #1: The current FDA language for qualified and unqualified claims does not communicate the four intended levels of scientific certainty to consumen. All of the studies tested examples of language that FDA has approved tentatively for the five studies tested FDA claim that spaned more qualified health claims in labeling. Four of 17 See, e.g., Comments of the Staff of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, the Bureau of Economics, and the Offce of Policy Planning of the FTC in the Matter of Food Labeling: Health Claims; Dietar Guidance, Docket No. 2003-0496 (Jan. 26, 2004); Comments of the Staff of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, the Bureau of Economics, and the Offce of Policy Planning of the FTC in the Matter of Obesity Working Group; Public Workshop: Exploring the Link Between Weight Management and Food Labels and Packaging, Docket No. 2003N-0338 (Dec. 12, 2003); Comments of the Staff of the Bureau of Economics, the Bureau of Consumer Protection, and the Ofce of Policy Planning of the FTC in the Matter of Food Labeling: Trans Fatty Acids in Nutrition Labeling: Consumer Research to Consider Nutrient Content and Health Claims and Possible Footnote on Disclosure Statements, Docket No. 03N\u00ad 0076 (Oct. 9, 2003). 7 FTC-Dce 0877 than one level of scientific certty. These \"language-only\" claims do not employ any symbols or letter grades to describe the level of certainty the claim is intended to communicate. The IPIC and FDA studies tested the largest number and broadest range of these claims. The IFIC research included a \"sorting\" exercise that produced strong evidence that the curent FDA language does not fuction as intended. In this experiment, consumers compared four of the FDA claims, one from each of the four levels of scientific certinty (\"A\" through \"D\"). Only 22 percent of the parcipants could sort the four claims in the correct order of scientifc certainty.18 The more formal copy test portions of the FDA and IFIC studies asked respondents to rate the scientific certinty conveyed by a given claim on a 7-point scale that ranged frm (1) \"very uncertin\" to (7) ''very certin.\" Unlike the IPIC sorting exercise, in these tests different groups of consumers saw different clais and could not compar the language side by side. Neither study found a statistically significant relationship between the average certainty scores that respondents gave the various claims and the level of cerinty the claims were intended to convey.19 That is, consumers who saw a label with a higher level FDA claim did not on average choose scores that were higher than scores chosen by consumers who saw a lower level FDA claim. hi the Teratanavat-Hooker research, the average certainty ratings that college students assigned to an FDA unqualified \"A\" health claim did not differ significantly from the average 18 IFIC Foundation (Mar. 2005), supra note 7, at 5. Furer, on.e-third of the consumers rated the \"D\" claim (weakest science) as conveyig the highest level of certinty. 19 Derby & Levy, supra note 5, at 21; IFIC Foundation (Mar. 2005), supra note 7, at 5-8. 8 FTC-Dca 0878 rating given an FDA \"D\" level claim.20 Finally, in the Frace-Bone study, paricipants did not rate an FDA \"A\" claim as more certain than an FDA \"B\" claim.21 In short, these results suggest that the current FDA language for qualified claims does not distinguish adequately between the levels of science supporting these claims. Finding #2: Consumers do not perceive the current FDA SSA claim to convey strong scientific certainty. Research to date has found consistently that consumers believe that SSA claims are supported by less science than is in fact the case.22 This discounting of what is intended to be the strongest claim available in labeling greatly increases the difficulty of crafting qualified claims that differentiate varng levels of scientific cerainty below the level of significant scientific agreement. Evidence of this discountig can be found in all of the studies that conducted relevant tests. In the FDA study, the average scientific cerinty score for the various SSA claims ranged from 3.9 to 4.8 on a 7-point scale.23 The IFIC study findings are similar.24 The Teratanavat- Hooker study recorded an average certainty rating of 4.11 out of a possible seven points for the 20 Hooker, supra note 9, at 19. 21 France & Bone, supra note 10, at 45. 22 The format for this claim is: \"Diets rich in substance X may reduce the risk of disease Y.\" 23 Analysis is based on data provided to FTC staffby FDA staff. Removing the \"may\" from this claim made very little difference in the certinty scores. The maximum average score achieved was stil was only about 4.8. 24 Again, the highest average rating for the SSA claim was 4.8 and the lowest recorded average score was only 2.8 out of a possible seven points. (Analysis is based on data provided to FTC staff by IFIC staff.) 9 FTC-DCO 0879 FDA SSA claim.2s Finally, the average certinty scores in the France-Bone study for the two tested FDA SSA claims were 3.5 and 4.0 on a six-point scale.26 In par, these scores may reflect basic consumer skepticism of promotional claims, however worded.27 As we detail below, however, consumers gave higher certainty ratings to other approaches to unqualified claims, including a strongly worded \"proof' claim used in FTC staffs copy test research and a \"report card\" format claim tested in the IFC study. Finding #3: The results of the FTC stafrs copy tests indicate that it is possible to craft language that differentiates clearly among differing levels of scientific certainty. Durg the past 10 years, the FTC staff has conducted a seres of four copy tests of qualified health claims in advertising. These tests incoIporated several approaches to measurg the degree of support for a qualified health claim, including a 5-level rating scale in the early tests and a 7 -point scale in the most recent research. Over the course of consumer perception of health claims - one unqualified claim and thee this research, FTC staff tested four levels of successively more qualified claims - all appearng in prit ads for a fictional antioxidant vitamin supplement. The unqualified claim, referenced hereafter as the \"proof' claim, used very strong language to convey a high level of scientific certainty for the effcacy of antioxidant vitamins in reducing the risk of cancer. The relevant portion of the text stated: 2S Hooker, supra note 9, at 35. 26 France & Bone, supra note 10, at 44 (Table 2, Cell 2). 27 See. e.g.., Calfee, lE., & Rigold, DJ., The Seventy Percent Majority: Enduring Consumer Beliefs about Advertising, 13 J. PuBLIC POLICY AND MARKETING: 228-238 (1994). 10 FTC-Dce 0880 Scientists have now proven that supplements containing these same antioxidant vitamins also reduce the nsk of cancer. It's a fact! Although this claim very likely overstates the degree of certainty scientists would accord a diet-disease relationship, it was included for experimental puroses in the early testing to provide a firm basis for determining whether it was feasible to devise qualifyng language that could communicate a lower level of certinty to consumers.28 A \"mildly\" qualified claim used language intended to convey a \"weight-of-the-evidence\" level claim similar to FDA's curent \"B\" level claim29 The qualifying language stated that the evidence \"looks promising, but scientists won't be sure unti longer term research is completed.\" A stronger \"qualified\" claim cautioned that: It's too early to tell for sure. Some studies have failed to show tht these vitamis protect against cancer. Longer term research is needed. Finally, the most recent FTC staff copy tests included a more highly qualified \"Box Disclaimer\" adverisement that contained the followig disclaimer set off inside a box: There is much scientific debate about whether antioxidant vitamin supplements reduce the nsk of some kinds of cancer. Most studies have failed to show that these vitain supplements reduce the nsk of cancer. 28 Hall the results shown no significant difference between consumer interpretation of this proof claim and the qualified claims, we could have concluded with some certainty that attempts to qualify health claims ar unlikely to be effective. 29 At the time this claim was first tested in 1998, the science supporting the relationship between antioxidant vitamin supplements and a reduced cancer nsk arguably could the FTC's series of copy tests, however, the have been rated at a level \"B.\" Over the course of science weakened to a \"e\" leveL. 11 FTC-DCO 0881 Figu 1 shows the average certainty scores that respondents assigned to these claims using a 5-point scale.30 On average, consumers were able to discern clear differences in the level of certinty communicated by these claims. As intended, the average cerainty scores decline consistently as the level of intended qualification increases, i.e., as the science becomes less certin. It is also clear from comparg the results for the proof and mildly qualified claim that even a small degree of qualification can reduce consumers' certainty ratigs substantially. 31 30 Murhy (2005), supra note 8 at 22. The mea score for the Highly Qualified Box Disclaimer is from an earlier unpublished copy test pedormed in July 2002. 31 An analysis of the distrbution of ratings across the five certinty choices shows that 58 percent of respondents seeing the proof claim thought that scientists were \"sure\" about the effcacy of antioxidant vitamin supplements, whereas only 22 percent of respondents seeing the mildly qualified claim thought that the science was \"sure.\" For the quaified claim and the highly qualified box disclaimer test ads, the figues for \"sure\" were, respectively, ten percent and five percent. Figure \"report card\" formats performed consistently well on the ranking tests. The report card approach to communicating scientific certainty uses a letter grade (from \"A\" to \"0\") rather than a verbal description to describe the certainty of the science supporting a given health claim. The FDA and IFC studies used two formats to present the letter gmde. In the \"report card text\" version, a health claim supported by, say, a \"c\" level of science is followed by the statement: FDA evaluated the scientific evidence and gave it a \"c\" mting, based on a scale from A (strongest evidence) to D (weakest evidence); A second approach, called the \"report card graphic,\" uses four levels of boxes with the appropriate box checked off. These boxes are labeled, from top to bottom: \"A: Strong Evidence;\" Figue 2 presents an example of a \"D\" level report card graphic label used in the FDA copy test.32 the report card fonnat tracked the intended level of certinty for the \"B\" through \"D\" claims. FDA did not test an \"A\" level report card claim, but instead used a shortened verion of the curreIit language-only format for an SSA claim. (\"Substance X may reduce the risk of disease Y.\") Interestingly, the \"B\" level report card scores were consistently higher than the SSA claim scores, which may be another indication that the curent unqualified language is not communicating a suffciently high level of In FDA's research, the average certinty scores for both versions of scientific certainty.33 32 Derby & Levy, supra note 6, at 10. 33 Derby & Levy, supra note 5, at 23; Analysis is based on data supplied to FTC by FDA staff. 14 staff FTC-Dca 0884 Figure 2 l5 FTC-Dca 0885 The IFIC research, which, unlike the FDA test, included report card formats for \"A\" level claims, found that consumers could distingush reliably among the four levels of qualification when shown labels using the same report car graphic format used by the FDA. With the report card text format, respondents could distinguish between two levels (A-B and C_D).34 In absolute terms, the Report Card \"A\" average certainty scores were consistently higher than the corresponding average languge-only SSA claims~35 Finally, the Terataavat-Hooker study tested an \"A\" and \"D\" level report card grphic formt in combination with the corrsponding curent FDA language-only claim, and also tested the current FDA language standing alone. Respondents could distinguish the claims when the report card graphic was included, but could not distinguish when the claim was presented in language form only.36 Again consistent with the findings of other research, the mean certinty rating for the report card version of the unqualified health claim was significantly higher than for the FDA unqualified claim standing alone (5.02 vs. 4.11 on a 7-point scale).37 Finding #5: Consumer interpretation of qualifying language varies widely. In its most recent researh, the FTC staff tested three possible qualified claims for antioxidant vitamin supplements and a reduced risk of cancer, including the ver strong \"Box Disclaimer\" discussed earlier. Consumers were asked \"How certin is the evidence?\" FTC staff used a 7-point scale for these ads. The average certainty scores for the thee ads (3.33 to 4.04 on 34 IFIC Foundation (Mar. 2005), supra note 7, at 6-7. 35 Data provided to FTC staff by IFIC staff. 36 Hooker, supra note 9, at 19 and graph at 38. 37 ld. at 35. 16 FTC-DCO 0886 a 7 -point scale) were at or below the midpoint of the scale, values that appear reasonable for a level of science that is below a weight-of-the-evidence stadad. For any given claim, however, the scores that individual consumers chose did not cluster tightly around the average score. Instead, the choices were spread out across the scale. As shown in Figu 3, an approximately equal proportion of consumers seeing the highy qualified Box Disclaimer chose option 1 (The science is \"not at all cerain\"); option 3 (The science is \"slightly certn\"); and option 5 (The science is \"somewhat certin..\"). Furer, one- the science above the midpoint.38 This suggests that these consumers may have overestiated the degree of scientific certinty for the antioxidant vitamin-cancer relationship, which, as indicated, is supported by less than the weight of the evidence.39 third of the respondents rated the certinty of 38 Murhy (2005), supra note 8 at 29. 39 Although some varation in consumer interpretation of qualified health claims is inevitable given what are almost certainly broad differences in respondents' background beliefs, the degree of variation observed in the research is nonetheless surrising, parcularly for the heavily qualified claims, such as the Box Disclaimer, that incorporate very strong languge intended to communicate a low level of certinty. It is possible that such a \"disclaimer\" rus counter to the basic effcacy claim being made for the product. . Rather tha qualifying the. claim, the \"disclaimer\" may contradict it, leaving consumers in a diffcult interpretative situation that is reflected in the wide varation in responses. See J. Howard Beales, Remarks Before the Food and Drug Law Institute's Conference on Qualified Health Claims, at 8-9 (Jan. 14,2004), scientific certinty ratings in the FDA's study also show wide varation in choices among consumers seeing the same label claim. This vanation is evident for both the claims in language-only and report card format. For example, 40 percent of respondents seeing a Report Card Text \"D\" claim ling lycopene with a reduced nsk of prostate. cacer rated the certainty of the science at 5 or higher on the 7 -point scale, and thus arguably were misled concerning the true level of scientific support. (Thir-seven percent gave the science a score of 3 or lower, and the remaider (24%) chose the midpoint score of 4).40 The results suggest that a qualified claim that, on average, communicates the correct level of scientific certinty may stil mislead a substatial number of consumers. IV. Implications for Future Research The research fidings discussed above have at least four implications for futue research efforts on qualified health claims. Implication #1: Other approaches to language-only claims should be explored. Although the tested FDA language did not communicate diffenng levels of scientific support clearly, the results of FTC stafr s copy tests suggest that it may be possible to craft language-only claims that do perform satisfactonly. As emphasized above, one diffculty with the FDA's curnt approach may be an insufficiently strong SSA claim. In particular, the SSA claim makes no mention of the high degree of scientific support for this class of diet-disease relationships. 40 We did not have access to the underlyig data for the other studies presented at the November 17 meeting and could not determine the degree of variation in the individual scores in that research. 19 FTC-DCO 0889 One possible solution to this problem would be to include an explicit description of the quality of the underlyig evidence in each claim leveL. We show below an example of such a format using four levels of qualification. The FTC staff has not tested this language, and we provide the ilustration only to stimulate thought on the tye of language-only claims that might perform most effectively. Claim Level Claim A. Very strong evidence shows that a diet rich in substance X reduces the risk of disease Y. B. Promising evidence indicates that a diet nch in substace X reduces the nsk of disease Y, but the evidence is not definite. C. Some evidence suggests that a diet nch in substance X may reduce the nsk of disease Y, but the evidence is weak. D. Limited evidence suggests that a diet nch in substance X may reduce the risk of disease Y, but the evidence is very weak. Implication #2: Additional approaches simiar to the report card format should be tested. As discussed, the varous studies found that the report card format was largely successful in communicating diffenng levels of scientific certnty to consumers. One potential diffculty with this approach, however, is that letter grades curently appear on certai product labels as a measure of product quality, e.g., Grade A tukey, eggs, and butter. Marketers might therefore be reluctant to use any scientific certinty score below an \"A\" for fear consumers would constre the grade too broadly as a negative statement about overall product quality.41 41 It should be noted, however, that relevant chars included in IFC's November i 7 presentation do not reveal strong evidence of any such undesirable \"spilover\" effects from the report card reporting system. These chars show, inter alia, the average ratings that consumers 20 FTC-DCO 0890 The positive results for the report card format suggest that other simple scorig methods that do not rely on letter grades might also be successful and should be targeted for testing in futue research projects. For example, certinty might be displayed on a thennometer-tye scale, or perhaps using a system of stars, checkmarks, or numerical ratings. (The FDA may wish to consult with consumer education specialists in developing different ratings systems to test.) Alternatively, the letter grades might simply be removed from the report card graphic display, since the level of evidence corresponding to each box is already described in summary fashion (see Figue 2). Implication #3: IFC's \"sort test\" can help allocate research resources As discussed, IFIC found that FDA's languge-only claims could i\u00cc\u00f2t pass a simple sorting test exercise where consumers sawall of the claims simultaneously and then attempted to rank the claims in the right order of intended scientific certinty. Relative to full copy tests, such a test is relatively inexpensive to perform and can quickly weed out claims that are unliely to function as intended in subsequent fonnal copy testing. In paricular, the sorting exercise wil allow researchers to determe quickly whether other approaches to language-only claims should gave for product quality and safety when shown only a nutrent content claim (which is labeled \"control\" in the chars), and the corresponding ratings for the test conditions where consumers saw an explicit health claim in report card text or graphic format. There are no statistically significant differences between any of the quality or safety ratings in the report card conditions and those in the nutrent content test conditions. This lack of differences suggests that marketers could make an explicit health claim, rather than the less informative nutrent content claim, without any adverse repercussions on consumer perceptions of product quality or safety. See IFIC Foundation (Mar. 2005), supra note 7, slides 6 and 7, available at htt://ww . ific.orglresearch/upload/Slides. pdf 21 FTC-DCO 0891 be explored. Accordingly, researchers may wish to include such a sorting exercise as a preliminar component of studies in this area. Implication #4: Future research should examine the degree of variation in certainty ratings for a given test condition. It is important that any system for qualifyng claims meet the theshold rang test that requires average ratings of scientific certainty for the varous testing conditions to decline as the degree of qualification increases. As we noted in our discussion of the FTC staff and FDA staff respondents seeing the same claim frequently selected copy tests, however, a large proportion of scores that were considerably above or below the average score. Even if the average ratig is considered consistent with the actual level of scientific support for the claim, the qualified languge might stil mislead or confse a substantial number of consumers. 42 A system of qualified claims that communicates the correct level of scientific certinty to a larger proportion of consumers would reduce this concern. Future researchers may wish, therefore, to address this issue explicitly. V. Conclusion The FDA is to be applauded for its importnt research on consumer interpretation of qualified health claims and for providing the opportnity for other researchers to present their findings in a public foru. The vanous studies have provided valuable insights into the performance of alternative approaches to conveyig levels of scientifc certinty in labeling and 42 The wide dispersion in ratings could also indicate that consumers were confused by the rating system itself. This issue might be explored in futue research by using different rating systems to test the same claims. The degree of variation in responses found for each of the rating systems could then be compared to determe which rating system was easiest for consumers to understand. 22 FTC-Dca 0892 advertising. Inparticular, the research suggests that FDA's curent \"language only\" claims are not clearly communicating differences in scientific certinty. At the same time, certain findings indicate that it may be possible to craf language tht wil function more successfully in this regard. 23 FTC-DCO 0893 Finally, the \"report card\" format was generally successful in communicating differences in scientific certinty, although a significant degre of disagreement was evident in consumer interpretation of the grades assigned to the claims. As discussed, these findings can help shape the next round of research in this important area of public policy. Respectfully submitted, Michael A.

Scientific research on the associations I between supplements and health is accumulating rapidly. The number of products - and the varety of uses for which they are promoted - have increas signiticantly in the last few years. The role of the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces laws outlawing \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" is to ensure that consumers get accurate information about dietary supplements so that they can make informed decisions about these products. i The Federa Trade Commission (FTC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) work together under a long-standing liaison agreement governing the division of responsibilties between the two agencies. As applied to dietary supplements, the FDA has primar responsibilty for claims on product labeling, including packaging, inserts, and other promotional materials distributed at the point of sale. The FTC ha primar responsibility for claims in advertising, including print and broadcast ads, infomercials, cataogs, and similar direct marketing materials. Marketing on the Internet is subject to regulation in the sae fashion as promotions through any other media. Because of their shared jurisdiction, the two agencies work closely to ensure that their enforcement efforts are consistent to the fullest extent feasible. In 1994, the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act (DSHEA) signiticantly changed the FDA's role in regulating supplement labeling.2 These claims are commonly referred to as \"structure/function\" claims.3 Although DSHEA does not directly apply to advertising, it has generated many questions about the FTC's approach to dietary supplement advertising. The answer to these . '..,.,. ._' dieta supplements - advertising for ~ product ~ incl~ding, '.. ...' AtI~sln9fcu~ and substantiated. Given the dramatic increase in the .f:~ r;\"\"A!fPl'uct : , volume and variety of dietar supplement advertising in :i~LIf\"\"\"hf\u00ed-t- - --. . _.__'____n__'_ recent years, FTC staff is issuing this guide to clarify how . \u00b7 '., '., l~etmi~l\u00e8~ing; \\ . long-standing FTC policies and enforcement . . dietar supplement advertising. . s..l)stnti~;..\" - .\" \" The FTC's approach to supplement advertising is best ilustrated by its Enforcement Policy Statement on Food Advertising (Food Policy Statement). Although the Food Policy Statement does not spitcally refer to supplements, the principles underlying the FTC's regulation of health claims in food advertsing are relevant to the agency's approach to health claims in supplement advertising. In general, the FTC gives great deference to an FDA determination of whether there is adequate support for a health claim. Furthermore, the FTC and the FDA wil generally arive at the same conclusion when evaluating unqualitied health claims. As the Food Policy Statement notes, however, there may I FTC-Dca 1043 be certn limited instaces when a carfully qualified health claim in advertising may be permissible under FTC law, in circumstaces where it has not ben authorize for labeling. However, supplement marketers are cautioned that the FTC wil require both strong scientific support and careful presentation for such claims.3 Supplement marketers should ensure that anyone involved in promoting products is familar with basic FTC advertising principles. The FTC has taen action not just against supplement manufacturers, but also, in appropnate circumstances, against ad agencies, distributors, retailers, catalog companies, infomercial producers and others involved in deceptive promotions. Therefore, all parties who participate directly or indirectly in the marketing of dietary supplements have an obligation to mae sure that claims are presented truthflly an to check the adequacy of the support behind those claims. FTC-Dca 1044 I .APPLICATION OF FTC LAW TO DIETARY SUPPLEMENT ADVERTISING The FTC's truth-in-advertising law can be boiled down to two common-sense propositions: 1) advertising must be truthful and not misleading; and 2) before disseminating an ad, advertsers must have adequate substantiation for all objective product cLaims.6 A deceptive ad is one that contans a misrepresentation or omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances to their detriment. The FfC's substantiation standard is a flexible one that depends on many factors. When evaluating claims about the effcacy and safety of foods, dieta supplements and drugs, the FTC has typically applied a substatiation standard of competent and reliable scientific evidence. To determine whether an ad complies with FfC law, it is first necessary to identify all express and implied claims that the ad conveys to consumers. Once the claims are identified, the scientific evidence is assesse to determne whether there is adequate support for those claims. The following setions describe this two-step process with examples ilustrating how principles of ad interpretation an substatiation apply in the context of dieta supplement advertising. The examples have ben simplified to ilustrate one or two specific points. Therefore, advertisers should use these examples as general guidance only. 7 1. Identifying Claims and Interpreting Ad Meaning _i~__ldenti.fy-ng_E)(pre$~_and_-imp_lje.dj;1\u00a1jm$_____ _._____.____.n_______n___ __.__.. n_ The first step in evaluating the truthfulness and accuracy of advertising is to identify all express and implied claims an ad conveys to consumers. Advertisers must make sure that whatever they say expressly in an ad is accurate. Often, however,. an ad conveys other claims beyond those expressly stated. Under FTC law, an advertiser is equally responsible for the accuracy of claims suggested or implied by the ad. Advertisers canot suggest claims that they could not make directly. When identifying claims, advertisers should not focus just on individual phrass or statements, but rather should consider the ad as a whole, assessing the \"net impression\" conveyed by all elements of the ad, including the text, product name, and depictions. When an ad lends itself to more than one reasonable interpretation, the advertiser is responsible for substantiating each I FTC-DCO 1045 interpretation. Copy tests, or other evidence of how consumers actually interpret an ad, can be valuable. In many cases, however, the implications of the ad are clear enough to determine the existence of the claim by examining the ad alone, without extrinsic evidence. Example 1 An advertisement claims that \"university studies prove\" that a mineral supplement can improve athletic performance. The advertiser has expressly stated the level of support for the claimed benefit and is therefore responsible for having \"university studies\" that document the advertised benefit. Furthermore, the implied reference to scientific evidence likely conveys to consumers the implied claim that the studies are methodologically sound. Example 2 An advertisement for a vitamin supplement claims that 90% of cardiologists regularly take the product. In addition to the literal claim about the percentage of cardiologists who use the product, the ad likely conveys an implied claim that the product offers some benefit for the heart. Therefore, the advertiser must have adequate support for both representations. Depending on how it is phrasd, or the context in which it is presented, a statement about a product's effect on a norm \"structure or function\" of the body may also convey to consumers an implied claim that the product is beneficial for the treatment of a diseas. If elements of the ad imply that the product also provides a disease beneIit, the advertiser must be able to substantiate the implied diseas claim even if the ad contains no express reference to diseas. Example 3 An ad for an herbal supplement makes the claim that the product boosts the immune system to help maintain a healthy nose and throat during the winter season. The ad features the product name \"Cold Away\" and includes images of people sneezing and coughing. The various elements of the ad - the product name, the depictions of cold sufferers, and the reference to nose and throat health during the winter season - likely convey to consumers that the product helps prevent colds. Therefore, the advertiser must be able to substantiate FTC-Dca 1046 I that claim. Even without the product name and images, the reference to nose and throat heaLth during the winter season may still convey a coLd prevention claim. Example 4 An ad for a dietary suppLement called \"Arthricure\" claims that the product maintains joint heaLth and mobilty into oLd age. The \"before\" picture shows an eLderLy women using a waLker. The \"after\" picture shows her dancing with her husband. The images and product name likeLy convey impLied claims that the product is effective in the treatment of the symptoms of arthritis, and may also impLy that the product can cure or mitigate the disease. The advertiser must be abLe to substantiate these impLied claims. 2. When to Disclose Qualifying Information An advertisement can also be deceptive beause of what it fails to say. Section 15 of the FTC Act requires advertisers to disclose information if it is material in light of representations made by the ad, or material considering how consumers would customarly use the or suggested product. Thus, if an ad would be misleading without certain qualifying information, that information must be disclosed. For example, advertisers should disclose information relevant to the limited applicabilty of an advertise benefit. Similarly, advertising that makes either an express or implied safety representation should include information about any significant safety risks. Even in the absence of affrmative safety representations, advertisers may need to inform consumers of significant safety concerns relating to the use of their product. -p- --P-----.-------------Example- 5- ._.------ -. p.. An advertsement for a muLti-vitamin/mineral suppLement claims that the product can eliminate a specific mineraL deficiency that resuLts in feelings of fatigue. In fact, Less than 2% of the generaL popuLation to which the ad is targeted suffers from this deficiency. The advertser shouLd disclose this fact so that consumers wil understand that only the smaLL percentage of peopLe who suffer from the actuaL mineraL deficiency are likeLy to experience any reduction in fatigue from using the product. I FTC-Dca 1047 Example 6 An advertser for a weight loss supplement cites a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study as demonstrating that the product resulted in an average weight loss of fifteen pounds over an eight-week period. The weight loss for the test group is, in fact, greater than for the control subjects. significantly However, both the control and test subject engaged in regular exercise and followed a restricted-calorie diet as part of the study regimen. The advertisement should make clear that users of the supplement must follow the same diet and exercise regimen to achieve the claimed weight loss results. Example 7 An advertiser claims that its herbal product is a natural pain reliever \"without the side effects of over-the\u00ad counter pain relievers.\" However, there is substantial evidence that the product can cause nausea in some consumers when taken regularly. Because of the reference to the side effects of other pain relievers, consumers wouLd likely understand this ad to mean that the herbal product posed no significant adverse effects. Therefore, the advertiser should disclose information about the adverse effects of the herbal product. Example 8 An herbal weight loss product contains an ingredient which, when consumed daily over an extended period, can result in a significant increase in blood pressure. Even in the absence of any representation about the product's safety, the advertser should disclose this potentially serious risk. 3. Clear and Prominent Disclosure When the disclosure of qualifying information is necessary to prevent an ad from being deceptive, that information should be presented clearly and prominently so that it is actually noticed and understood by consumers. A fine-print disclosure at the bottom of a print ad, a FTC-DCO 1048 I disclaimer buned in a body of text, a brief video superscript in a television ad, or a disclaimer that is easily missed on an Internet web site, are not likely to be adequate. To ensure that disclosures are effective, marketers should use clear language, avoid small type, place any qualifying information close to th claim being qualified, and avoid making inconsistent statements or distracting elements that could undercut or contradict the disclosure. Because consumers are likely to be confused by ads that include inconsistent or contradictory information, disclosures need to be both direct and unambiguous to be effective. Example 9 A marketer promotes a supplement as a weight loss aid. There is adequate substantiation to indicate that the product can contribute to weight loss when used in conjunction with a diet and exercise regimen. The banner headline claims \"LOSE 5 POUNDS IN 10 DAYS,\" the ad copy discusses how easy it is to lose weight by simply taking the product 3 times a day, and the ad includes dramatic before-and-after pictures. A fine print disclosure at the bottom of the ad, \"Restricted calorie diet and regular exercise required,\" would not be suffciently prominent to qualify the banner headline and the overall impression that the product alone wil cause weight loss. The ad should be revised to remove any implication that the weight loss can be achieved by use of the product alone. This revision, combined with a prominent indication of the need for diet and exercise, may be suffcient to qualify the claim. However, if the research does not show that the product contributes anything to the weight loss effect caused by diet and exercise, it would be deceptive, even with a disclosure, to promote the product for weight loss. Qualifying information should be suffciently simple and clear that consumers not only notice it, but also understand its significance. This can be a paricular challenge when explaining complicated scientific concepts to a general audience, for example, if an advertiser wants to promote the effect of a supplement where there is an emerging body of science supporting that effect, but the evidence is insuffcient to substantiate an unqualified claim. The advertiser should make sure consumers understad both the extent of scientific support and the existence of any significant contrar evidence. Vage qualifying terms - for example, that the product \"may\" have the claimed benefit or \"helps\" achieve the claimed benefit - are unlikely to be adequate. Furtermore, advertisers should not make qualified claims where the studies they rely on are contrar to a stronger body of evidence. In such instace, even a qualified claim could mislead consumers. I FTC-Dca 1049 Example 10 A company has results from two studies suggesting that the main ingredient in its supplement helps to maintain healthy cholesterol levels. There are, however, significant limitations to each of the studies and a better controlled study is necessary to confirm whether the effect is genuine. The company makes a claim in advertising that \"scientific studies show that our product may be effective in reducing cholesteroL.\" The use of the word \"may\" is not likely to be a suffcient disclaimer to convey the limitations of the science. A disclosure that clearly describes the limitations of the research, in language consumers can easily understand, and states directly and unambiguously that additional research is necessary to confirm the preliminary results is more likely to be effective. As discussed in the following section on substantiating claims, the extent to which studies support an unqualified claim wil depend largely on what experts in the relevant field would consider to be adequate support. II Substantiating Claims In addition to conveying product claims clearly and accurately, marketers nee to verify that there is adequate support for their claims. Under FTC law. before disseminating an ad. advertisers must have a reasnable basis for all express and implied product claims. What constitutes a reasonable basis depends greatly on what claims are being mae, how they are presented in the context of the entire ad, and how they are qualified. The FTC's stadard for evaluating substantiation is suffciently tlexible to ensure that consumers have access to information about emerging areas of science. At the same time, it is suffciently rigorous to ensure that consumers can have confidence in the accuracy of information presented in advertising. A number of factors determine the appropriate amount and type of substantiation, including: . The Type of Product. Generally, products related to consumer health or safety require a relatively high level of substantiation. . The Type of Claim. Claims that are diffcult for consumers to assess on their own are held to a more exacting standard. Examples include health claims that may be subject to a placebo effect or technical claims that consumers cannot readily verify for themselves. FTC-Dce 1050 I . The Benefits of a Truthful Claim and The Cos/Feasibilty of Developing Subsntiation for the Cla. These factors are often weighed together to ensure that valuable product information is not witheld from consumers beause the cost of developing substantiation is prohibitive. This does not mean, however, that an advertiser can make any claim it wishes without substantiation, simply beause the cost of researh is too high. . The Consquences of a Fals Claim. This includes physical injury, for example, if a consumer relies on an unsubstatiated claim about the theraputic benefit of a product and foregoes a proven treatment. Economic injury is also considered. . The Amount of Substantiation that Experts in the Field Believe is Reasnable. In making this determination, the FTC gives great weight to accepted norms in the relevant tields of research and consults with experts from a wide variety of disciplines, including those with experience in botaicals and traditional medicines. Where there is an existing standard for substantiation developed by a governent agency or other authoritative body, the FfC accords great deference to that standard. The FTC typically requires claims about the eftcacy or safety of dietar supplements to be supported with \"competent and reliable scientific evidence,\" defined in FTC cass as \"tests, analyses, research, studies, or other evidence basd on the expertise of professionals in the relevant area, that have ben conducted and evaluated in an objective maner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results.\" This is the same standard the FTC applies to any industry making health- related claims. There is no fixed formula for the number or type of studies required or for more specific. parameters like sample size and study duration. There are, however, a number of considerations to guide an advertiser in assessing the adequacy of the scientific support for a specific advertising claim. 1. Ads that Refer to a Spedfic Level of Support ... If an \u00e4dvertiserasS\u00ebitsthat it I\u00ef\u00e3S-\u00e4.ce-itaiI\u00cfTever\u00f5t-uppoftuf\u00f5i-\u00e4\u00df- adveft\u00edsed-cla\u00ecm,-\u00edfmiist \u00f5\u00eb able to demonstrate that the assertion is accurate. Therefore, as a staring point, advertisers must have the level of support that they claim, expressly or by implication, to have. Example 11 An ad for a suppLement includes the statement \"Scientists Now Agree!\" in discussing the product's . benefit. This statement LikeLy conveys to consumers that the state of science supporting the benefit has reached the LeveL of scientific consensus. UnLess the advertiser possesses this LeveL of evidence, the claim is not substantiated. I FTC-Dca 1051 Example 12 An advertiser claims that its product has been \"studied for years abroad\" and is now the \"subject of U.S. government-sponsored research.\" In addition to the explicit claim that the product has been studied, such phrases Likely convey to consumers an implied claim that there exists a substantial body of competently- conducted scientific research supporting the effcacy of the product. The advertser would be responsible for substantiating both claims. 2. The Amount and Type of Evidence When no specific claim about the level of support is made, the evidence neeed depends on the nature of the claim. A guiding principle for determining th amount and type of evidence that wil be suffcient is what experts in the relevant area of study would generally consider to be adequate. The FTC wil consider all forms of competent and reliable scientific research when evaluating substatiation. As a general rule, well-controlled human clinical studies are the most reliable form of evidence. Results obtained in animal and in vitro studies wil also be examined, paricularly where they are widely considered to be acceptable substitutes for human research or where human research is infeasible. Although there is no requirement that a dietary supplement claim be supported by any specific number of studies, the replication of research results in an independently-conducted study adds to the weight of the evidence. In most situations, the quality of stdies wil be more important than quantity. When a clinical trial is not possible (e.g., in the cas of a relationship between a nutrient and a condition that may take decades to develop), epidemiologic evidence may be an acceptable substitute for clinical data, especially when supported by other evidence, such as research explaining the biological mechanism underlying the claimed effect. Anecdotal evidence about the individual experience of consumers is not suffcient to substantiate claims about the effects of a supplement. Even if those experiences are genuine, other factors unrelated to the supplement. Individual experiences are not a substitute for scientific research.8 they may be attributable to a placebo etTect or Example 13 An advertiser relies on animal and in vitro studies to support a claim that its vitamin supplement is more easily absorbed into the bloodstream than other forms of the vitamin. However, the animal research uses a species of animal that, unlike humans, is able to synthesize the vitamin, and the in vitro study uses a different formulation with a higher concentration of the FTC-Dca 1052 I compound than the product being marketed. In addition, human research is feasible and relatively inexpensive to conduct in light of the potential sales of the product and is the type of research generally accepted in this partcular field of study. The substantiation is likely to be inadequate in this case, both because there are significant methodological problems and because, in this partcular instance, human research is both feasible and the accepted approach in the field. Example 14 A company wants to advertise its supplement as helpful in maintaining good vision into old age. There have been two long-term, large-scale epidemiologic studies showing a strong association between life-long high consumption of the principal ingredient in the supplement and better vision in those over 70. Expert have also discovered a plausible biological mechanism that might explain the effect. A clinical intervention trial would be very diffcult and costly to conduct. Assuming that experts in the field generally consider epidemiological evidence to be adequate to support the potential for a protective effect, and assuming the absence of any stronger body of contrary evidence, a claim that is qualified to accurately convey the nature and extent of the evidence would be permitted. Example 15 An advertisement for a supplement claims that the product wil cause dramatic improvements in memory and describes the experiences of 10 people who obtained these results. The descriptions of these anecdotal experiences are truthful, but the advertser has no scientific substantiation for the effect of its product on memory and cannot explain why the product might produce such results. The individual experiences are not adequate to substantiate the claim without confirming scientific research. I FTC-Dca 1053 3. The Quality of the Ev;dence In addition to the amount and type of evidence, the FTC wil also examine the internal validity of each piece of evidence. Where the claim is one that would require scientific support, the research should be conducted in a competent and reliable maner to yield meaningful results. The design, implementation, and results of each piece of research are important to assessing the adequacy of the substantiation. There is no set protocol for how to conduct research that wil be acceptable under the FTC substantiation doctrine. There ar, however, some principles generally accepted in the scientific community to enhance the validity of test results. For example, a study that is carefully controlled, with blinding of subjects and researchers, is likely to yield more reliable results. A study of longer duration can provide better evidence that the claimed effect wil persist and resolve potential safety questions. Other aspects of the research results - such as evidence of a dose-respnse relationship (i.e., the larger the dose, the greater the effect) or a recognize biological or chemical mechanism to explain the effect - are examples of factors that add weight to the findings. Statistical significance of findings is also important. A study that fails to show a statistically significant difference between test and control group may indicate that the measured effects are merely the result of placebo effect or chance. The results should also translate into a meaningful benefit for consumers. Some results that are statistically significant may stil be so small that they would mean only a trivial effect on consumer health. The nature and quality of the written report of the research are also important. Research cannot be evaluated accurately on the basis of an abstract or an informal summar. In contrast, although the FTC does not require that studies be published and wil consider unpublished, proprietar research, the publication of a peer-reviewed study in a reputable journal indicates that the research has received some measure of scrutiny. At the sa time, advertisers should not rely simply on the fact that research is published as proof of the effcacy of a supplement. Research may yield results that are of suffcient interest to the scientific community to warant publication, but publication does not necessarly mean that such research is conclusive evidence of a substance's effect. The FTC considers studies conducted in foreign countries as long as the design and implementation of the study are scientifically sound.9 EXample 16 An advertser conducts a literature search and finds several abstracts summarizing research about the association between a nutrient and the ability to perform better on memory tests. The advertiser relies on these summaries to support a claim that its supplement, aids memory. which contains the same nutrient, However, without looking carefully at the specifics of the study design, implementation, and results, there is FTC-Dca 1054 I no way for an advertiser to ascertain whether the research substantiates the product claims. (For example, did the research use a comparable formulation of the ingredient? Was the study adequately controlLed? Did the study yield results that are statistically significant?) The advertser should carefully review the underlying science, with the assistance of an expert if necessary, before drafting advertising claims. Example 17 An advertiser makes an unqualified claim about the anti\u00ad clotting effect of a supplement that contains a compound extracted from fruit. There are three studies supporting the effect and no contrary evidence. One study consists of subjects tested over a one-week period, with no control group. The second study is well\u00ad controlLed, of longer duration, but shows only aslight effect that is not statistically significant. The third study administers the compound through injection and shows a significant anti-clotting effect, but there is some question whether the compound would be absorbed into the bloodstream if administered orally. Because the studies all have significant limitations, it would be diffcuLt to draft even a carefully qualified claim that would adequately convey to consumers the limited nature of the evidence. The advertser should not base a claim on these studies. Example 18 The marketer of an herbal supplement claims that its product promotes healthy vision and is approved in Germany for this purpose. The product has been used extensively in Europe for years and has obtained. approval by the German governmental authorities, through their monograph process, for use to improve vision in healthy people. The company has two abstracts of German trials that were the basis of the German monograph, showing that the ingredient significantly improved the vision of healthy individuals in the test group over the placebo group. Animal trials done by the company suggest a plausible mechanism to explain the I FTC-DCO 1055 effect. Although approval of the supplement under the German monograph suggests that the supplement is effective, advertsers should stil examine the underlying research to confirm that it is relevant to the advertisers product (for example, that the dosage and formulation are comparable) and to evaluate whether the studies are scientifically sound. Advertsers should also examine any other research that exists, either supporting or contradicting the monograph, especially if it is not possible to identify and review the research on which the monograph is based. 4. The Totality of the Evidence Studies canot be evaluated in isolation. The surrounding context of the scientific evidence is just as important as the internal validity of individual studies. Advertisers should consider all relevant research relating to the claimed benefit of their supplement and should not focus only on research that supports the effect, while discounting research that does not. Ideally, the studies relied on by an advertiser would be largely consistent with the surrounding body of evidence. Wide varation in outcomes of studies and inconsistent or contlcting results wil raise serious questions about the adequacy of an advertiser's substantiation. Where there are inconsistencies in the evidence, it is important to examine whether there is a plausible explanation for those inconsistencies. In some instaces, for example, the differences in or results are atributable to differences in dosage, the form of administration (e.g., oral intravenous), the population tested, or other aspets of study methodology. Advertisers should assess how relevant each piece of research is to the specific claim they wish to make, and also consider the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. If a number of studies of different quality have ben conducted on a speitic topic, advertisers should look first to the results of the studies with more reliable methodologies. The surrounding body of evidence wil have a significant impact both on what type, amount and quality of evidence is required to substantiate a claim and on how that claim is presented _ that is, how carefully the claim is qualified to reflect accurately the strength of the evidence. If a stronger body of surrounding evidence runs contrary to a claimed effect, even a qualified claim is likely to be deceptive. Example 19 An advertiser wishes to make the claim that a supplement product wil substantially reduce body fat. The advertiser has two controlled, double-blind studies showing a modest but statistically significant loss of fat at the end of a six-week period. However, there is an equally well-controlled, blinded 12-week study showing FTC-Dca 1056 I no statistically significant difference between test and control groups. Assuming other aspects of methodology are similar, the studies taken together suggest that, if the product has any effect on body fat, it would be very smaLL. Given the totality of the evidence on the subject, the claim is likely to be unsubstantiated. Example 20 Advertsements for a fiber supplement make the claim that the product is \"proven\" to aid weight loss. Although the company has two published, peer-reviewed studies showing a relationship between fiber and weight loss, neither of these studies used the same proportions of soluble and insoluble fiber or the same total amount of fiber as the supplement product. There are numerous controlled, published human clinical studies, however, using the amount and type of fiber in the supplement product, that provide evidence that the product would not result in measurable weight loss. The totality of the evidence does not support the \"proven\" claim and, given the stronger body of contrary evidence, even a qualified claim is likely to be deceptive. Example 21 An advertser runs an ad in a magazine for retired people, claiming that its supplement product has been found effective in improving joint flexibility. The COriR\u00eblJly_sP.9r:sQred a6-weekstuc;yof its .sllpplement,___p______._ involving 50 subjects over the age of 65, to test the product's effect on improving flexibility. The study was double-blinded and placebo-controLLed and has been accepted for publication in a leading medical journaL. The study showed dramatic, statisticaLLy significant increases in joint flexibilty compared to placebo, based on objective measurements. In addition, several large trials have been conducted by European researchers using a similar formulation and dose of the active ingredient in the supplement. These trials also found statisticaLLy significant results. The advertser reviewed the underlying European research and confirmed that it meets accepted research standards. The evidence as a whole likely substantiates the claim. I FTC-Dca 1057 5. The Relevance of the Evidence to the Specific Claim problem in substatiation of advertising claims is that an advertiser has valid studies, but the studies do not support the claim made in the ad. Advertisers should make sure that the research on which they rely is not just internally valid, but also relevant to the specific product being promoted and to the specific benefit being advertised. Therefore, advertisers should ask questions such as: How does the dosage and formulation of the advertised product A commn compare to what was use in the study? Dos the advertised product contain additional ingredients that might alter the effect of the ingredient in the study? Is the advertise product administered in the same maner as the ingredient use in the study? Does the study population reflect the characteristics and lifestyle of the population targeted by the ad? If there life use beingare significant discrepancies between the research conditions and the real promoted, advertisers nee to evaluate whether it is appropriate to extrapolate from the research to the claimed effect. In drafting ad copy, the advertiser should take care to make sure that the claims match the underlying support. Claims that do not match the science, no matter how sound that science is, are likely to be unsubstantiated. Advertising should not exaggerate the extent, nature, or permanence of the effects achieved in a study, and should not suggest greater scientific certainty than actually exists. Although emerging science can sometimes be the basis for a carefully qualified claini, advertisers must make consumers aware of any significant limitations or inconsistencies in the scientific literature. Example 22 An ad for a supplement claims that a particular nutrient helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels. There is a substantial body of epidemiologic evidence suggesting that foods high in that nutrient are associated with lower cholesterol levels. There is no science, however, demonstrating a relationship between the specific nutrient and cholesterol, although it would be feasible to conduct such a study. If there is a basis for believing that the health effect may be attributable to other components of the food, or to a combination of various components, a claim about the cholesterol maintenance benefits of the supplement product is likely not substantiated by this evidence. FTC-Dce 1058 I Example 23 A number of weLL-controLLed clinical studies have been conducted to suggest that a mineral supplement can improve mental alertness and memory in subjects with significantly impaired blood circulation to the brain. A claim suggesting that the supplement wil improve memory or mental alertness in healthy adults may not be adequately substantiated by this evidence. Advertisers should not rely on research based on a specific test population for claims targeted at the general population without first considering whether it is scientifically sound to make such extrapolations. Example 24 An advertiser wants to make claims that its combination herbal product helps increase alertness and energy safely and naturally. The product contains two herbs known to have a central nervous system stimulant effect. The advertiser compiles competent and reliable scientific research demonstrating that each of the herbs, individuaLLy, is safe and causes no significant side effects in the recommended dose. This evidence may be inadequate to substantiate an unqualified safety claim. Where there is reason to suspect that the combination of multiple ingredients might result in interactions that would alter the effect or safety of the individual ingredients, studies showing the effect of the individual ingredients may be insuffcient to substantiate the safety of the multiple ingredient product. In this __~~~mpj~Ltbe _\u00e7n_l1bjnatiQr-Q\u00cd_l-WQ_b~Lb~with .simHaL_ .... _______.____. stimulant properties could produce a stronger cumulative stimulant effect that might present safety hazards. A better approach would be to investigate the safety of the specific combination of ingredients contained in the product. I FTC-Dca 1059 Example 25 Several clinical trials have been done on a specific botanical extract showing consistently that the extract is effective for supportng the immune system. The studied extract is a complex combination of many constituents and the active constituents that may produce the benefit are stil unknown. An advertiser wishes to cite this research in its advertising, as proof that its product wil support the immune system. The advertisers product is made using a different extracton method of the same botanicaL. An analysis of the extract reveals that it has a significantly different ' chemical profile from the studied extract. The advertiser should not rely on these clinical trials alone as substantiation because the difference in extract may result in significant differences in the two products' effcacy. II Other Issues Relating to Dietary Supplement Advertising In addition to the basic principles of ad meaning and substatiation discusse above, a number of other issues commonly arise in the context of dieta supplement advertising. The following sections provide guidance on some of these issues including: the use of consumer or bas on traditional uses of supplements; use ofexpert endorsements in ads; advertising claims the OSHEA disclaimer in advertising; and the application to advertising of the OSHEA exemption for certain categories of publications, commonly referred to as \"third par literature. \" 1. Cla;ms Based on Consumer Testimonials or Expert Endorsements An overall principle is that advertisers should not make claims either through consumer or expert endorsements that would be deceptive or could not be substatiated if made directly. io It is not enough that a testimonial represents the honest opinion of the endorser. Under FTC law, advertisers must also have appropriate scientific evidence to back up the underlying claim. Consumer testimonials raise additional concerns about which advertisers nee to be aware. Ads that include consumer testimonials about the effcacy or safety of a supplement product should be backed. by adequate substantiation tht the testimonial experience is representative of what consumers wil generally achieve when using the product. As discusse earlier, anecdota evidence of a product's effect, bas solely on th experiences of individual consumers, is generally insufficient to substantiate a claim. Furter, if the advertiser's substtiation does not demonstrate that the results are representative, then a clear and FTC-Dca 1060 I conspicuous disclaimer is necessary. The advertiser should either state what the generally expeted results would be or indicate that the consumer should not expect to experience the attested results. Vague disclaimers like \"results may var\" are likely to be insuffcient. Example 26 An advertsement for a weight loss supplement features a before-and-after photograph of a woman and quotes her as saying that she lost 20 pounds in 8 weeks while An asterisk next to the quotation using the supplement. references a disclaimer in fine print at the bottom of the ad that reads, \"Results may vary.\" The experience of the woman is accurately represented, but the separate, competent research demonstrating the effcacy of the supplement showed an average weight loss of only 6 pounds in 8 weeks. Therefore, the disclosure does not adequately convey to consumers that they would likely see much less dramatic results. The placement and size of the disclaimer is also insuffciently prominent to qualify the claim effectively. One approach to adequate qualification of this testimonial would be to include a piscLaimer immediately adjacent to the quote, in equal print size that says, \"These results are not typicaL. Average weight loss achieved in clinical study was 6 pounds.\" When an advertiser uses an expert endorser, it should make sure that the endorser has appropriate qualifications to be represented as an expert and has conducted an examination or testing of the product that would be generally recognize in the field as suffcient to support the endorsement. In addition, whenever an expert or consumer endorser is used, the . advertsershouldiscJo5eany_ materi.al_connectionbetw.enthe_endorser and the advertiser _oL. _ the product. A material connection is one that would affect the weight or credibilty of the endorsement, or put another way, a personal, financial, or similar connection that consumers would not reasnably expect. Example 27 An infomercial for a dietary supplement features an expert referred to as a \"Doctor\" and a \"leading clinician in joint health\" discussing the effect of a supplement product on the maintenance of healthy joints. The expert is not licensed to practice medicine, but has a graduate degree and is a trained physical therapist, running a sport clinic. The expert has not conducted I FTC-Dca 1061 any review of the scientific literature on the active component of the supplement. In return for appearing in the infomercial, she is given a paid position as an offcer the company. The ad is likely to be deceptive for several reasons. First, her qualifications as an expert have been overstated and she has not conducted suffcient examination of the product to support the endorsement. In addition, her connecton to the company is one that consumers might not expect and may affect the weight and credibilty of her endorsement. Even if she is adequately qualified and has conducted an adequate review of the product, her position as an offcer of the company should be clearly disclosed. Example 28 A best-selling book about the benefits of a suppLement product includes a footnote mentioning the most effective brand of the suppLement, by name. The manufacturer of the brand cited in the book has an exclusive promotional agreement with the author and has paid him to reference the product by name. The manufacturers ad touts the fact that its product is the onLy brand recommended in this best-sellng book. The ad is deceptive since it suggests a neutral endorsement when, in fact, the author has been paid by the manufacturer to promote the product. 2. Claims Based on Traditional Use Claims based on historical or traditional use should be substantiated by contirming scientitic evidence, or should be presented in such a way that consumers understad that the sole basis for the claim is a history of use of the product for a paricular purpose. A number of supplements, particularly botanical products, have a long history of use as traditional medicines in the United States or in other countries to treat certin conditions or symptoms. Several European countries have a separate regulatory approach to these traditional medicines, allowing manufacturers to make certn limited claims about their traditional use for treating certain health conditions. Some countries also require accompanying disclosures about th fact that the product has not ben scientifically established to be effective, as well as disclosures about potential adverse effects. At this time there is no separate regulatory process for approval of claims for these traditional medicine products under OSHEA an FDA labeling rules. FTC-DCO 1062 I In assessing claims base on traditional use, the FTC wil look closely at consumer perceptions and spifically at whether consumers expect such claims to be backed by supporting scientific evidence. Advertising claims bas solely on traditional use should be presented carefully to avoid the implication that the product has ben scientifically evaluated for effcacy. The degree of qualification necessar to communicate the absence of scientific substantiation for a traditional use claim wil depend in large par on consumer understanding of this category of products. As consumer awareness of and experience with \"traditional use\" supplements evolve, the extent and tye of qualification necessary is also likely to change. There are some situations, however, where traditional use evidence alone wil be inadequate to substatiate a claim, even if that claim is carefully qualified to convey the limited nature of the support. In determining the level of substantiation necessar to substantiate a claim, the FTC assesses, among other things, the consequences of a false claim. Claims that, if unfounded, could present a substantial risk of injury to consumer health or safety wil be held to a higher level of scientific proof. For that reason, an advertiser should not suggest, either directly or indirectly, that a supplement product wil provide a disease benefit unless there is competent and reliable scientific evidence to substatiate that benefit. The FTC wil closely scrutinize the scientific support for such claims, paricularly where the claim could lead consumers to forego othr treatments that have ben validated by scientific evidence, or to self-medicate for potentially serious conditions without medical supervision. The advertiser should also make sure that it can document the extent and manner of histoncal use and be careful not to overstate such use. As par of this inquiry, the advertiser should make sure that the product it is marketing is consistent with the product as traditionally administered. If there are significant differences between the traditional use product and the marketed product, in the form of administration, the formulation of ingredients, or the dose, a \"traditional use\" claim may not be appropriate. Example 29 The advertiser of an herbal supplement makes the claim, \"Ancient folklore remedy used for centuries by Native Americans to aid digestion.\" The statement about traditional use is accurate and the supplement product is consistent with the formulation of the product as traditionally used. However, if, in the context of the ad, this statement suggests that there is scientific evidence demonstrating that the product is effective for aiding digestion, the advertiser would need to include a clear and prominent disclaimer about the absence of such evidence. I FTC-DCO 1063 Example 30 A supplement manufacturer wants to market an herbal product that has been used in the same formulation in China as a tonic for improving mental functions. The manufacturer prepares the product in a manner consistent with Chinese preparation methods. The ad claims, \"Traditional Chinese Medicine - Used for Thousands of Years to Bring Mental Clarity and Improve Memory.\" The ad also contains language that clearly conveys that the effcacy of the product has not been confirmed by research, and that traditional use does not establish that the product wil achieve the claimed results. The ad is likely to adequately convey the limited nature of support for the claim. Example 31 A supplement manufacturer markets a capsule containing a concentrated extract of a botanical product that has been used in its raw form in China to brew teas for increasing energy. The advertisement clearly conveys that the energy benefit is based on traditional use and has not been confirmed by scientific research. The ad may stil be deceptive, however, because the concentrated extract is not consistent with the traditional use of the botanical in raw form to brew teas and may produce a significantly different effect. Example 32 A supplement ad claims that a supplement liquid mineral solution has been a popul'r American folk remedy since early pioneer days for shrinking tumors. The ad is likely to convey to consumers that the product is an effective treatment for cancer. T~ere is no scientific support for this disease benefit. B\u00e9cause of the potential risks to consumers of taking a product that mayor may not be effective to treat such a serious health condition, possibly without medical supervision, the advertiser should not make the claim. FTC-Dca 1064 I 3. Use of the OSHEA Disclaimer in Advertsing Under DSHEA, all statements of nutntional support for dieta supplements must be accompanied by a two-par disclaimer on the product label: that the statement has not ben evaluated by FDA and that the product is not intended to \"diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.\" Although DSHEA does not apply to advertising, there are situations where such a disclosure is desirable in advertising as well as in labeling to prevent consumers from being misled about the nature of the product and the extent to which its effcacy an safety have been reviewed by regulatory authorities. For example. a disclosure may be necessar if the text or images in the ad lead consumers to believe that the product.has undergone the kind of review for safety and effcacy that the FDA conducts on new drugs and has been found to be beneficial for the treatment of disease. Failure to correct those misperceptions may render the advertising deceptive. At the same time, the inclusion of a DSHEA disclaimer or similar disclosure wil not cure an otherwise deceptive ad, paricularly where the deception concerns claims about the diseas benet\u00ects of a product. In making references to DSHEA aid FDA review, advertisers should also be careful not to mischaracterize the extent to which a product or claim has ben reviewed or approved by the FDA. Compliance with the notification and disclaimer provisions of DSHEA does not constitute authorization of a claim by FDA and advertisers should not imply that FDA has specifically approved any claim on that basis. Example 33 A company markets a suppLement for \"maintaining joint flexibility.\" The product packaging is similar in coLor and design to a nonprescription drug used to treat joint pain associated with arthritis and the product name is simiLar to the drug counterpart. The ad includes statements urging consumers to \"ask their pharmacist\" and \"accept no generic substitute.\" The various _.- eLements-Gf.the-ad mayLead-cGnsumer-5-t\u00d0--beLie-vethat--\u00ad the supplement is, in fact, an approved drug, or may give consumers more general expectations that the product has been subjected to similar government review for safety and effcacy. A clear and prominent disclaimer may be necessary to indicate that the product has not been evaluated by FDA and is not an approved drug product. I FTC-Dca 1065 Example 34 An advertisement for an herbal supplement includes strong, unqualified claims that the product wil effectvely treat or prevent diabetes, heart disease, and various circulatory ailments. The advertser does not have adequate substantiation for this claim, but includes the OSHEA disclaimer prominently in the ad. In face of the strong contradictory message in the ad, the inclusion of the OSHEA disclaimer is not likely to negate the explicit disease claims made in the ad, and wil not cure the fact that the claims are not substantiated. Example 35 A dietary supplement advertisement makes a number of claims about the benefits of its product for supportng various body functions. The ad also includes the statement, \"Complies with FDA notification procedures of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act.\" This statement may suggest to consumers that FDA has authorized the claims made in the ad or that it has reviewed the support for the claims and found the product to be effective. Because there is no review and authorization process for such claims under OSHEA, this would be deceptive. 4. Third Part Literature Dietar supplement advertisers should be awar that the use of newspaper aricles, abstracts of scientific studies, or other \"third par literature\" to promote a paricular brand or product can have an impact on how consumers interpret an advertisement and on what claims the advertiser wil be responsible for substantiating. For purposes of dietar supplement labeling, Section 5 of DSHEA provides an exemption from labeling requirements for scientific journal aricles, boks and other publications use in the sale of dieta supplements, provided these materials are reprinted in their entirety, are not false or misleading, do not promote a specific brand or manufacturer, are presented with other materials to create a balanced view of the scientific information, and are physically separate from the supplements being sold. The FTC wil generally follow an approach consistent with the labeling approach when evaluating the use of such publications in other contexts, such as advertsing. Although the FTC does not regulate the content or accuracy of statements made in independently written and published books, aricles, or other non-commercial literature, FTC law does prohibit the deceptive use of such materials in marketing products. The determination of whether the FTC-DCO 1066 I materials wil be subject to FTC jurisdiction turns largely on whether the materials have ben created or are being used by an adveniser specifically for the purpose of promoting its product. As a practical matter, publications and other materials that comply with the elements of the DSHEA provision, paricularly with the requirement that such materials be truthful, not misleading and balanced, are also likely to comply with FTC advertising law. Example 36 An author publishes a book on the curative properties of an herb. The book title is liThe Miracle Cancer Cure.\" The book does not endorse or otherwise mention any particular supplement brand. The author/publisher does not sell the herbal supplement and does not have any material connection to any marketers of the herb. As non-commercial speech, the book itself would not be subject to the FTC's jurisdiction over advertising. However, if a marketer of the herb referred to the book in advertising materials (for instance, by quoting the title and using excerpts to describe the anti-cancer benefits of its product), such references would likely be considered advertsing. The advertiser would be responsible for substantiating any claims about the advertisers product that are conveyed by these references. CONCLUSION . -.M arketersof dietary supplements should be familar with the requirements under bothDSHEA and the FTC Act that labeling an advertising claims be truthful, not misleading and substantiated. The FTC approach generally requires that claims be backed by sound, scientific evidence, but also provides flexibilty in the precise amount and type of support necessary. This flexibilLy allows advertisers to provide truthful information to consumers about the benefits of supplement products, and at the same time, preserves consumer confidence by curbing unsubstantiated, false, and misleading claims. To ensure compliance with FTC law, supplement advertisers should follow two important steps: 1) careful drafting of advertising claims with paricular attention to how claims are qualified and what express and implied messages are actually conveyed to consumers; and 2) careful review of the support for a claim to make sure it is scientitcally sound, adequate in the context of the surrounding body of evidence, and relevant to the specific product and claim advenise. I FTC-Dca 1067 Endnotes 1 The FTC's authority derives from Section 5 of the FTC Act. In addition, supplements have tradition\u00ad ally been regulated under Sections 12 and 15, which prohibit false advertsements, defined as those that are \"misleading in a material respect,\" for foos, drugs, devices or cosmetics. 2 Under DSHEA, supplement marketers are allowed to make two kinds of claims on labeling: 1) health claims specifically authorize by the FDA; and 2) statements of nutritional support. Health claims \u00ad representations about the relationship between a nutrient and a disease or health-related condition \u00ad are permitted only if they have been authorize by an FDA finding that there is \"significant scientific agreement\" to support the claim. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) also now allows health claims that are based on \"authoritative statements\" from certain federal scientific bodies, such as NIH and the National Academy of Sciences. Aside from these authorized claims, supplement marketers are prohibited from making any labeling claim about the diagnosis, mitigation, treatment or cure of a disease. In contrast to health claims, \"structure/function\" claims, within the broader category of \"statements of nutritional support,\" refer to representations about a dietary supplement's effect on the structure or function of the body for maintenance of good health and nutrition. 3 Structure/function claims are not subject to FDA pre-authoriztion. A marketer may make these claims in labeling if it notifies FDA and includes a disclaimer that the claim has not been evaluated by FDA and that the product is not intended to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent disease. DSHEA also requires that structure/function claims in labeling be substantiated and be truthful and nol misleading. This requirement is fully consistent with the FTC's standard that advertsing claims be truthful, not misleading and substantiated. 4 FTC policy statements and other information for businesses and consumers are available on the FTC's Internet home page, ww.ftc.gov. , As indicated in the Food Policy Statement, the FTC wil be \"especially vigilant in examining whether qualified claims are presented in a manner that ensures that consumers understand both the extent of th support for the claim and the existence of any significant contrary view within the scientific com\u00ad munity. In the absence of adequate qualification the Commission wil find such claims deceptive.\" 6 These principles are articulated in the FTC's Deception Policy Statement and Advertising Substantia\u00ad tion Policy Statement, available at ww.rtc.gov. The FTC also has authority to challenge unfair trade practices. An unfair practice is one that causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailng benefits to consumers or competition. The majority of advertising cases are brought pursuant to the FTC's deception authority. 7 Throughout these examples the terms \"advertiser,\" \"marketer,\" \"supplement manufacturer\" and used interchangeably. \"company\" are 8 Additional guidance on the use of consumer testimonials is provided in Part C.l. 9 Any foreign research submitt to the FTC in the course of an investigation should be presente in English translation and with suffcient detail to allow the agency to evaluate the study.
