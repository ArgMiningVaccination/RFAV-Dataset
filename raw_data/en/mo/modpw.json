{"title": "Didanosine (Videx)", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2021-01-26", "cleaned_text": "pancreatitis has occurred during therapy with VIDEX used alone or in combination regimens in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. VIDEX should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#Section_5.1) ]. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including didanosine and other antiretrovirals. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. Coadministration of VIDEX and stavudine is contraindicated because of increased of serious and/or life-threatening events [see [Contraindications (4)](#Section_4), [Warnings and Precautions (5.2)](#Section_5.2) ]. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occurs. 1. Indications and Usage VIDEX\u00ae (didanosine, USP), also known as ddI, in combination with other antiretroviral agents is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#Section_14) ]. 2. Dosage and Administration VIDEX should be administered on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before or 2 hours after eating. 2.1 Recommended Dosage (Adult and Pediatric Patients) The preferred dosing frequency of VIDEX is twice daily because there is more evidence to support the effectiveness of this dosing regimen. Once-daily dosing should be considered only for patients whose management requires once-daily dosing of VIDEX [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#Section_14) ]. The recommended adult total daily dose is based on body weight (kg) (see Table 1). |at least 60 kg||less than 60 kg| Preferred dosing 200 mg twice daily 125 mg twice daily Dosing for patients whose management requires once-daily frequency 400 mg once daily 250 mg once daily Pediatric Patients (2 weeks old to 18 years old): The recommended dose of VIDEX (didanosine) in pediatric patients between 2 weeks old and 8 months old is 100 mg per m2 twice daily, and the recommended VIDEX dose for pediatric patients greater than 8 months old is 120 mg per m2 twice daily but not to exceed the adult dosing recommendation. Dosing recommendations in patients less than 2 weeks of age cannot be made because the pharmacokinetics of didanosine in these children are too variable to determine an appropriate dose. There are no data on once-daily dosing of VIDEX in pediatric patients. 2.2 Renal Impairment Adult Patients In adult patients with impaired renal function, the dose of VIDEX should be adjusted to compensate for the slower rate of elimination. The recommended doses and dosing intervals of VIDEX in adult patients with renal insufficiency are presented in Table 2. |a 400 mg once daily (at least 60 kg) or 250 mg once daily (less than 60 kg) for patients whose management requires once-daily frequency of administration.| Creatinine Clearance(mL/min) Recommended VIDEX Dose by Patient Weight at least 60 kg less than 60 kg at least 60 200 mg twice dailya 125 mg twice dailya 30-59 200 mg once dailyor 100 mg twice daily 150 mg once dailyor 75 mg twice daily 10-29 150 mg once daily 100 mg once daily less than 10 100 mg once daily 75 mg once daily Pediatric Patients Urinary excretion is also a major route of elimination of didanosine in pediatric patients, therefore the clearance of didanosine may be altered in pediatric patients with renal impairment. Although there are insufficient data to recommend a specific dose adjustment of VIDEX in this patient population, a reduction in the dose should be considered (see Table 2). Patients Requiring Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) or Hemodialysis For patients requiring CAPD or hemodialysis, follow dosing recommendations for patients with creatinine clearance of less than 10 mL per min, shown in Table 2. It is not necessary to administer a supplemental dose of VIDEX following hemodialysis. 2.3 Dosage Adjustment Concomitant Therapy with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate In patients who are also taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a dose reduction of VIDEX to 250 mg (adults weighing at least 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL per min) or 200 mg (adults weighing less than 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL per min) once daily is recommended. VIDEX and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may be taken together in the fasted state. Alternatively, if tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is taken with food, VIDEX should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 30 minutes before food or 2 hours after food). The appropriate dose of VIDEX coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL per min has not been established. [see [Drug Interactions (7)](#Section_7) and [Clinical Pharmacology information for VIDEX EC (enteric-coated formulation of didanosine) for results of drug interaction studies of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with reduced doses of the enteric-coated formulation of didanosine.) Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#Section_5.3) and [Clinical Pharmacology 2.4 for Reconstitution Prior to dispensing, the pharmacist must reconstitute dry powder with Purified Water, USP, to an initial concentrationof 20 mg per mL and immediately mix the resulting solution with antacid to a final concentration of 10 mg per mL asfollows: 20 mg per mL Initial Solution Reconstitute the product to 20 mg per mL by adding 100 mL or 200 mL of Purified Water, USP, to the 2 g or 4 g ofVIDEX powder, respectively, in the product bottle. 10 mg per mL Final Admixture - Immediately mix one part of the 20 mg per mL initial solution with one part of any commercially available antacid that contains as active ingredients aluminum hydroxide (400 mg per 5 mL), magnesium hydroxide (400 mg per 5 mL), and simethicone (40 mg per 5 mL) for a final dispensing concentration of 10 mg VIDEX per mL. For patient home use, the admixture should be dispensed in appropriately sized, flint-glass or plastic (HDPE, PET, or PETG) bottles with child-resistant closures. - Instruct the patient to shake the admixture thoroughly prior to use and to store the tightly closed container in therefrigerator. The bottles of powder should be stored at 59 \u00b0F to 86 \u00b0F (15 \u00b0C to 30 \u00b0C). The VIDEX admixture may be stored up to30 days in a refrigerator, 36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F (2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C). Discard any unused portion after 30 days. 3. Dosage Forms and Strengths 4. Contraindications VIDEX is contraindicated when coadministered with the following medications: - Allopurinol- systemic exposures of didanosine are increased, which increase didanosine-associated toxicity [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#Section_12.3)]. didanosine (dideoxyadenosine 5-triphosphate) are increased. Fatal hepatic failure, well as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis have been reported in patients receiving both didanosine and ribavirin. 5. Warnings and Precautions 5.1 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis has occurred during therapy with VIDEX used alone or in combination regimens in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. VIDEX should be suspended in patients with signs or symptoms of pancreatitis and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis. Coadministration with stavudine When treatment with life-sustaining drugs known to cause pancreatic toxicity is required, suspension of VIDEX (didanosine) therapy is recommended. In patients with risk factors for pancreatitis, VIDEX should be used with extreme caution and only if clearly indicated. Patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, especially the elderly, are at increased risk of pancreatitis and should be followed closely. Patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for pancreatitis if treated without dose adjustment. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose related [see [Adverse severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including didanosine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. [Use in Specific Populations (8.1)](#Section_8.1) ]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering VIDEX to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with VIDEX should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical signs or symptoms with or without laboratory findings consistent with symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.3 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of VIDEX have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. Coadministration of VIDEX should be avoided. [see [Contraindications (4)](#Section_4), [Adverse Reactions (6) and Drug Interactions (7.2)](#Section_6) ]. 5.4 Non-cirrhotic Portal Hypertension Postmarketing cases of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension have been reported, including cases leading to liver transplantation or death. Cases of didanosine-associated non-cirrhotic portal hypertension were confirmed by liver biopsy in patients with no evidence of viral hepatitis. Onset of signs and symptoms ranged from months to years after start of didanosine therapy. Common presenting features included elevated liver enzymes, esophageal varices, hematemesis, ascites, and splenomegaly. Patients receiving VIDEX should be monitored for early signs of portal hypertension (eg, thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly) during routine medical visits. Appropriate laboratory testing including liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, albumin, complete blood count, and international normalized ratio (INR) and ultrasonography should be considered. VIDEX should be discontinued in patients with evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. 5.5 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving VIDEX therapy. Peripheral neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, in patients with a history of neuropathy, or in patients being treated with neurotoxic drug therapy. Discontinuation of VIDEX should be considered in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy [see [Contraindications (4)](#Section_4), [Adverse Reactions (6), and Drug Interactions (7.2)](#Section_6) ]. 5.6 Retinal Changes and Optic Neuritis Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in adult and pediatric patients. Periodic retinal examinations should be considered for patients receiving VIDEX [see [Adverse Reactions (6)](#Section_6) ]. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including VIDEX. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Lipoatrophy Treatment with VIDEX has been associated with loss of subcutaneous fat, which is most evident in the face, limbs, and buttocks. The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy are related to cumulative exposure, and is often not reversible when VIDEX treatment is stopped. Patients receiving VIDEX should be frequently examined and questioned for signs of lipoatrophy, and if feasible therapy should be switched to an alternative regimen if there is suspicion of lipoatrophy. 6. Adverse Reactions The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: - Pancreatitis [see Peripheral neuropathy [see [Warnings (5.5)](#Section_5.5)] - changes and optic neuritis [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.6)](#Section_5.6)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In addition, pancreatitis resulting in death was observed in 2 of 68 patients who received VIDEX plus stavudine plus indinavir plus hydroxyurea in an ACTG clinical trial [see [Warnings and Precautions (5)](#Section_5) ]. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose related. In phase 3 studies, incidence ranged from 1% to 10% with doses higher than are currently recommended and from 1% to 7% with recommended dose.

Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in these patients were generally consistent with the safety profile of didanosine in adults. In pediatric phase 1 studies, pancreatitis occurred in 2 of 60 (3%) patients treated at entry doses below 300 mg per m2 per day and in 5 of 38 (13%) patients treated at higher doses. In study ACTG 152, pancreatitis occurred in none of the 281 pediatric patients who received didanosine 120 mg per m2 every 12 hours and in less than 1% of the 274 pediatric patients who received didanosine 90 mg per m2 every 12 hours in combination with zidovudine [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#Section_14) ]. Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in pediatric patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of didanosine. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to VIDEX, or a combination of these factors. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders - anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Body as a Whole - alopecia, anaphylactoid reaction, asthenia, chills/fever, pain. Digestive Disorders and flatulence. Exocrine Gland Disorders - pancreatitis (including and liver Disorders - diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal Disorders - myalgia (with or without increases in creatine kinase), rhabdomyolysis including acute renal failure and hemodialysis, arthralgia, Disorders and Precautions](#Section_5) ( [5.6](#Section_5.6))]. 7. Drug Interactions 7.1 Established Drug Interactions Clinical recommendations based on the results of drug interaction studies are listed in Table 8. Pharmacokinetic results of drug interaction studies are shown in Tables 12 and 13 [see [Contraindications a The dosing for coadministration of VIDEX EC and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with respect to meal consumption differs from that of VIDEX. See the complete prescribing information for VIDEX EC. ciprofloxacin ciprofloxacin concentration Administer VIDEX at least 2 hours after or 6 hours before ciprofloxacin. delavirdine delavirdine concentration Administer VIDEX 1 hour after delavirdine. ganciclovir didanosine concentration If there is no suitable alternative to ganciclovir, then use in combination with VIDEX with caution. Monitor for didanosine-associated toxicity. indinavir indinavir concentration Administer VIDEX 1 concentration Do not coadminister methadone with VIDEX pediatric powder due to significant decreases in didanosine concentrations. If coadministration of methadone and didanosine is necessary, the recommended formulation of didanosine is VIDEX EC. Patients should be closely monitored for adequate clinical response when VIDEX EC is coadministered with methadone, including monitoring for changes in HIV RNA viral load. nelfinavir No interaction 1 hour after didanosine Administer nelfinavir 1 hour after VIDEX. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate didanosine concentration A dose reduction of VIDEX to the following dosage once daily is recommended.a VIDEX and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may be taken together in the fasted state. If tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is taken with food, VIDEX should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 30 minutes before food or 2 hours after food). Patients should be monitored for didanosine-associated toxicities and clinical response. Exposure to didanosine is with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [see Clinical Pharmacology [(12.3)](#Section_12.3) worsen didanosine-related clinical toxicities, including pancreatitis, fumarate with VIDEX should be undertaken with caution, and patients should be monitored closely for didanosine-related toxicities and clinical response. VIDEX should be suspended if signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia, or lactic acidosis and Precautions (5)](#Section_5) ]. Suppression of CD4 cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily. 7.2 Predicted Drug Interactions Predicted drug interactions with VIDEX are listed in Table 9. |Drug or Drug Class||Effect||Clinical Comment| | Indicates increase.| Indicates decrease. a Only if other drugs are not available and if clearly indicated. If treatment with life-sustaining drugs that cause pancreatic toxicity is required, suspension of VIDEX is recommended [see b [See Drugs that may cause pancreatic toxicity risk of pancreatitis Use only with extreme cautiona Neurotoxic drugs risk of neuropathy Use with cautionb Antacids containing magnesium or aluminum side effects associated with antacid components Use caution with VIDEX Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution Azole antifungals ketoconazole or itraconazole concentration Administer drugs such as ketoconazole or itraconazole at least 2 hours before VIDEX.

Tetracycline antibiotics antibiotic concentration Consult package insert of the tetracycline. Hydroxyurea risk of pancreatitis, fatal hepatotoxicity, and severe peripheral neuropathy Use should be avoided. 8. Use in Specific Populations 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to VIDEX during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263. Risk Summary Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. It is unclear if pregnancy augments the risk of lactic acidosis/hepatic steatosis [Warnings and Precautions stavudine is [Contraindications (4)](#Section_4)]. Based on APR reports, congenital malformations were reported when administered during pregnancy. The prevalence of birth defects was 4.7% in the first trimester compared with 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) and 4.2% in the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR) (see Data). No pattern of defects was identified by the APR. Based on these findings, the clinical relevance is uncertain. The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 15 to 20%. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with didanosine at systemic exposures (AUC) up to 12 (rats) and 14 (rabbits) times the exposure in humans at the recommended daily human dose of VIDEX (see Data). Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Cases of lactic acidosis syndrome, sometimes fatal have occurred in pregnant individuals using VIDEX in combination with stavudine. VIDEX is associated with an risk Data Human Data Based on prospective reports to the APR exposure to didanosine-containing regimens during pregnancy (including 427 exposed in the first trimester and 462 exposed in the second/third trimester), the prevalence of birth defects in live births was 4.7 % (95% CI: 2.9% to 7.1%) with CI: trimester exposure to didanosine-containing regimens compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP and 4.2% in the TBDR. Prospective reports from the APR of overall major birth defects in pregnancies exposed to VIDEX is compared with a U.S. background major birth defect rate. Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP and TBDR as the external comparator groups. Limitations of using external comparators include differences in methodology and populations, as well as confounding due to the underlying disease. Animal Data Didanosine was administered orally at up to 1000 mg per kg daily to pregnant rats and at up to 600 mg per kg daily to pregnant rabbits on gestation Days 7 to 17 and 6 to 18, respectively, and also to rats 14 days before mating through weaning. No adverse effects on embryo-fetal development (rats and rabbits) were observed up to the highest dose tested. During organogenesis, systemic exposures (AUC) to didanosine were up to 12 (rats) and 14.2 (rabbits) times the estimated human exposure at the recommended daily human dose. Didanosine and/or its metabolites are transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In the rat pre/postnatal development study, reduced food intake and body weight gain was observed in the offspring of females administered didanosine at a maternally toxic exposure (approximately 12 times the exposure at the recommended human dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. It is not known whether VIDEX is present in human breast milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breastfed infant. When administered to lactating rats, didanosine was present in milk (see Data). Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants) and (3) adverse reactions in breastfed infants similar to those seen in adults, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving VIDEX. Data Didanosine and its metabolites were excreted into the milk of lactating rats following a single oral dose of 50 mg per kg on lactation Day 14, with milk concentrations 5 times that of maternal plasma concentrations at 8 and 24 hours post-dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use Use of didanosine in pediatric patients from 2 weeks of age through adolescence is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of VIDEX in adult and pediatric patients 8.5 Geriatric Use In an Expanded Access Program for patients with advanced HIV infection, patients aged 65 years and older had a higher frequency of pancreatitis (10%) than younger patients (5%) [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#Section_5.1) ]. Clinical studies of didanosine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Didanosine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection. In addition, renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2)](#Section_2.2) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL per min) may be at greater risk of toxicity from didanosine due to decreased drug clearance [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#Section_12.3) ]. A dose reduction is recommended for these patients [see [Dosage and Administration (2)](#Section_2) ]. 10. Overdosage There is no known antidote for VIDEX (didanosine) overdosage. In phase 1 studies, in which VIDEX was initially administered at doses ten times the currently recommended dose, toxicities included: pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, hyperuricemia, and hepatic dysfunction. Didanosine is not dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis, although there is some clearance by hemodialysis [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#Section_12.3) ]. 11. Description VIDEX\u00ae brand name for didanosine, a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue active against HIV-1. Didanosine is available as VIDEX, a Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution [see [How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)](#Section_16) ] [consult prescribing (didanosine)]. The for didanosine is 2,3-dideoxyinosine. The structural formula is: Didanosine is a white crystalline powder with the molecular formula C10H12N4O3 and a molecular weight of 236.2. The aqueous solubility of didanosine at 25\u00b0 C and pH of approximately 6 is 27.3 mg per mL. Didanosine is unstable in acidic solutions. For example, at pH less than 3 and 37\u00b0 C, 10% of didanosine decomposes to hypoxanthine in less than 2 minutes. 12. Clinical Pharmacology 12.1 Mechanism of Action Didanosine is an antiretroviral drug [see [Microbiology (12.4)](#Section_12.4)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic parameters of didanosine are summarized in Table 10. Didanosine is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations generally observed from 0.25 to 1.50 hours following oral dosing. Increases in plasma didanosine concentrations were dose proportional over the range of 50 to 400 mg. Steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly from values obtained after a single dose. Binding of didanosine to plasma proteins in vitro was low (less than 5%). Based on data from in vitro and animal studies, it is presumed that the metabolism of didanosine in man occurs by the same pathways responsible for the elimination of endogenous purines. |CSF = cerebrospinal fluid, ND = not determined.| a Parameter units for adults were converted to the same units in pediatric patients to facilitate comparisons among populations: mean adult body weight = 70 kg and mean adult body surface area = 1.73 m2. b In 1-day old infants (n=10), the mean \u00b1 SD apparent oral clearance was 1523 \u00b1 1176 mL/min/m2 and half-life was 2.0 \u00b1 0.7 h. c Following IV administration. d Following IV administration in adults and IV or oral administration in pediatric patients. e Mean \u00b1 SE. f Following oral administration. g Apparent oral clearance estimate was determined as the ratio of the mean systemic clearance and the mean oral bioavailability estimate.

Administration of VIDEX tablets up to 30 minutes before a meal did not result in any significant changes in bioavailability [see [Dosage and Administration (2)](#Section_2) ]. VIDEX should be taken on an empty stomach. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency: Data from two studies in adults indicated that the apparent oral clearance of didanosine decreased and the terminal elimination half-life increased as creatinine clearance decreased (see Table 11). Following oral administration, didanosine was not detectable in peritoneal dialysate fluid (n=6); recovery in hemodialysate (n=5) ranged from 0.6% to 7.4% of the dose over a 3-4 hour dialysis period. The absolute bioavailability of didanosine was not affected in patients requiring dialysis [See [Dosage and Administration = creatinine clearance. CL/F = apparent oral clearance.

Mean AUC and Cmax values following a single 400 mg dose of didanosine were approximately 13% and 19% higher, respectively, in patients with hepatic impairment compared to matched healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is needed, because a similar range and distribution of AUC and Cmax values was observed for subjects with hepatic impairment and matched healthy controls. [See [Dosage and Administration (2.3)](#Section_2.3) ]. Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of didanosine have been evaluated in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected pediatric patients from birth to adulthood. Overall, the pharmacokinetics of didanosine in pediatric patients are similar to those of didanosine in adults. Didanosine plasma concentrations appear to increase in proportion to oral doses ranging from 25 to 120 mg per m2 in pediatric patients less than 5 months old and from 80 to 180 mg per m2 in children above 8 months old.

Intracellularly, didanosine is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, dideoxyadenosine 5-triphosphate. Dideoxyadenosine 5-triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase both by competing with the natural substrate, deoxyadenosine 5-triphosphate, and by its incorporation into viral DNA causing termination of viral DNA chain elongation. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture The anti-HIV-1 activity of didanosine was evaluated in a variety of HIV-1 infected lymphoblastic cell lines and monocyte/macrophage cell cultures. The concentration of drug necessary to inhibit viral replication by 50% (EC50) ranged from 2.5 to 10 \u00b5M (1 \u00b5M = 0.24 \u00b5g/mL) in lymphoblastic cell lines and 0.01 to 0.1 \u00b5M in monocyte/macrophage cell cultures. Resistance HIV-1 isolates with reduced sensitivity to didanosine have been selected in cell culture and were also obtained from patients treated with didanosine. Genetic analysis of isolates from didanosine-treated patients showed amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, and M184V in reverse transcriptase. The L74V substitution was most frequently observed in clinical isolates. Phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 isolates from 60 patients (some with prior zidovudine treatment) receiving 6 to 24 months of didanosine monotherapy showed that isolates from 10 of 60 patients exhibited an average of a 10-fold decrease in susceptibility to didanosine in cell culture compared to baseline isolates. Clinical isolates that exhibited a decrease in didanosine susceptibility harbored one or more didanosine resistance-associated substitutions. Cross-resistance HIV-1 isolates from 2 of 39 patients receiving combination therapy for up to 2 years with didanosine and zidovudine exhibited decreased susceptibility to didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine in cell (A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M) in reverse transcriptase. In data from clinical studies, the presence of thymidine analogue mutation substitutions (M41L, D67N, L210W, T215Y, K219Q) has shown to response to didanosine. 13. Nonclinical Toxicology 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats for 22 and 24 months, respectively. In the mouse study, initial doses of 120, 800, and 1200 mg per kg per day for each sex were lowered after 8 months to 120, 210, and 210 mg per kg per day for females and 120, 300, and 600 mg per kg per day for males. The two higher doses exceeded the maximally tolerated dose in females and the high dose exceeded the maximally tolerated dose in males. The low dose in females represented 0.68-fold maximum human exposure and the intermediate dose in males represented 1.7-fold maximum human exposure based on relative AUC comparisons. In the rat study, initial doses were 100, 250, and 1000 mg per kg per day, and the high dose was lowered to 500 mg per kg per day after 18 months. The upper dose in male and female rats represented 3-fold maximum human exposure. Didanosine induced no significant increase in neoplastic lesions in mice or rats at maximally tolerated doses. Didanosine was positive in the following genetic toxicology assays: 1) the Escherichia coli tester strain assay; L5178Y/TK+/- mouse lymphoma mammalian cell gene mutation assay; 3) the in vitro chromosomal aberrations assay in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes; 4) the vitro chromosomal aberrations assay in Chinese Hamster Lung cells; and 5) the BALB/c 3T3 in vitro transformation assay. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in an Ames Salmonella bacterial mutagenicity assay or in rat and mouse in vivo micronucleus assays. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 12 and 14 times the estimated human exposure at the recommended daily human dose of VIDEX, respectively, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to didanosine. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Evidence of a dose-limiting skeletal muscle toxicity has been observed in mice and rats (but not in dogs) following long-term (greater than 90 days) dosing with didanosine at doses that were approximately 1.2 to 12 times the estimated human exposure. The relationship of this finding to the potential of VIDEX (didanosine) to cause myopathy in humans is unclear. However, human myopathy has been associated with administration of VIDEX and other nucleoside analogues. 14. Clinical Studies 14.1 Adult Patients Combination Therapy START 2 was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study comparing VIDEX (200 mg twice daily)/stavudine/indinavir to zidovudine/lamivudine/indinavir in 205 treatment-naive patients. Both regimens resulted in a similar magnitude of suppression of HIV-1 RNA levels and increases in CD4 cell counts through 48 weeks. Study AI454-148 was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study comparing treatment with VIDEX (400 mg once daily) plus stavudine (40 mg twice daily) and nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) versus zidovudine (300 mg twice daily) plus lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) and nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) in 756 treatment-naive patients, with a median CD4 cell count of 340 cells per mm3 (range 80 to 1568 cells per mm3) and a median plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.69 log10 copies per mL (range 2.6 to 5.9 log10 copies per mL) at baseline. Median CD4 cell count increases at 48 weeks were 188 cells per mm3 in both treatment groups. Treatment response and outcomes through 48 weeks are shown in Figure 1 and Table 14. Figure 1: Treatment Response Through Week 48*, AI454-148 |Percent of Patients with HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies/mL| (less than 50 copies/mL) |Week 48 Status||VIDEX/stavudine/nelfinavir| n=503 |lamivudine/zidovudine/nelfinavir| n=253 |* p less than 0.05 for the differences between treatment groups, by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.| a Patients achieved virologic response [two consecutive viral loads less than 400 (less than 50) copies/mL] and maintained it to Week 48. b Includes viral rebound and failing to achieve confirmed less than 400 (less than 50) copies/mL by Week 48. c Includes lost to follow-up, noncompliance, withdrawal, and pregnancy.

In treatment-naive patients (ACTG 116A), the rate of HIV disease progression or death was similar between the treatment groups; mortality rates were 26% for patients receiving VIDEX and 21% for patients receiving zidovudine. Of the patients who had received previous zidovudine treatment (ACTG 116B/117), those treated with VIDEX had a lower rate of HIV disease progression or death (32%) compared to those treated with zidovudine (41%); however, survival rates were similar between the treatment groups. Studies have demonstrated that the clinical benefit of monotherapy with antiretrovirals, including VIDEX, was time limited. 14.2 Pediatric Patients Efficacy in pediatric patients was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, controlled study (ACTG 152, conducted 1991-1995) involving 831 patients 3 months to 18 years of age treated for more than 1.5 years with zidovudine (180 mg per m2 every 6 hours), VIDEX (120 mg per m2 every 12 hours), or zidovudine (120 mg per m2 every 6 hours) plus VIDEX (90 mg per m2 every 12 hours). Patients treated with VIDEX or VIDEX plus zidovudine had lower rates of HIV-1 disease progression or death compared with those treated with zidovudine alone. 16.

Patient Counseling Information Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling [(](#Section_18.0) [Medication Guide](#Section_18.0) [)](#Section_18.0). Pancreatitis Pancreatitis Advise patients that a serious toxicity of VIDEX, used alone and in combination regimens, is pancreatitis, which may be fatal. VIDEX is stavudine [see [Warnings and pancreatitis. Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including didanosine and other antiretrovirals. Advise pregnant individuals of the potential risks of lactic syndrome/hepatic [ Use in Specific Populations (8.1)](#Section_8.1) ]. Hepatic Toxicity Inform patients that hepatotoxicity, including fatal hepatic adverse events, has been reported. The safety and efficacy of VIDEX have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. VIDEX is contraindicated in combination with stavudine [see Portal Hypertension Inform patients that non-cirrhotic portal hypertension has been reported in patients taking VIDEX, including cases leading to liver transplantation or death [see [ Warnings and Precautions](#Section_5) ( [5.4](#Section_5.4))]. Peripheral Neuropathy Inform patients that peripheral neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in hands or feet, may develop during therapy with VIDEX. Patients should be counseled that peripheral neuropathy occurs with greatest frequency in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease or a history of peripheral neuropathy, and that discontinuation of VIDEX may be required if toxicity develops [see [ Warnings and Precautions](#Section_5) ( [5.5](#Section_5.5))]. Retinal Changes and Optic Neuritis Inform patients that retinal changes and optic neuritis, which may result in blurred vision, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients. Advise patients to have regular eye exams while taking VIDEX [see [ Warnings and Precautions](#Section_5) ( [5.6](#Section_5.6))]. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any symptoms of infection, as in some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started [see [ Warnings and Precautions](#Section_5) ( [5.7](#Section_5.7))]. Lipoatrophy Inform patient that loss of body fat (e.g., from arms, legs, or face) may occur in individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy including VIDEX. Monitor patients receiving VIDEX to monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of lipoatrophy. Patients should be routinely questioned about body changes related to lipoatrophy [see [ Warnings and Precautions](#Section_5) ( [5.8](#Section_5.8))]. Drug Interactions VIDEX may interact with many drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription of non-prescription medication or herbal products, including alcohol, which may exacerbate VIDEX toxicities [see [Contraindications (4)](#Section_4), [Drug Interactions (7)](#Section_7)]. Pregnancy Registry Inform patients that there is an antiretroviral pregnancy registry to monitor fetal outcomes of pregnant individuals exposed to VIDEX [see [ Use in Specific Populations](#Section_8) ( [8.1](#Section_8.1))]. Lactation Advise mothers with HIV-1 not to breastfeed because HIV-1 can be passed to the baby in breast milk. [see [Use in Specific Populations](#Section_8) [ (8.2)](#Section_8.3)]. Dosing Information Instruct patients to take VIDEX on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before or 2 hours after eating. Instruct patients that the preferred dosing frequency of VIDEX is twice daily because there is more evidence to support the effectiveness of this dosing frequency. Once-daily dosing should be considered only for patients whose management requires once-daily dosing of VIDEX. Instruct patients not to miss a dose but if they do, patients should take VIDEX as soon as possible. Inform patients that it is important to take VIDEX on a regular dosing schedule and to avoid missing doses as it can result in development of resistance. Revised: December 2019 Medication Guide What is the most important information I should know about VIDEX? VIDEX can cause serious side effects, including: - Inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis) can happen in people who take VIDEX and can lead to death. People who take VIDEX in combination with the medicine stavudine may be at an increased risk for pancreatitis. Do not take VIDEX with stavudine. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms of pancreatitis: - Build-up of an acid in your blood (lactic acidosis). Lactic acidosis can happen in some people VIDEX or similar medicines (nucleoside analogues). Lactic acidosis is a serious medical emergency that can lead to death. There have been deaths reported in pregnant women who get lactic acidosis after taking VIDEX and stavudine. Do not take VIDEX with stavudine. - Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms which could be signs of lactic acidosis: - Severe liver problems, including liver failure, can happen in people who take VIDEX. Your liver may become large (hepatomegaly), you may develop fat in your liver (steatosis), or you may have high blood pressure in the large vein of your liver (portal hypertension). Severe liver problems can lead to liver transplantation or death in some people taking VIDEX. Taking VIDEX with medicines that contain hydroxyurea or stavudine may increase your risk for liver problems. You may be more likely to get lactic acidosis or severe liver problems if you are a female, are very overweight (obese), or have been taking nucleoside analogue medicines for a long time. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms of severe liver problems: For more information about side effects, see \"What are the possible side effects of VIDEX?\".

Revised: December 2018 [DailyMed](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)on January 26, 2021. pancreatitis has occurred during therapy with didanosine used alone or in combination regimens in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. VIDEX EC should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#Section_5.1) ]. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including didanosine and other antiretrovirals. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. Coadministration of VIDEX EC and stavudine is contraindicated because of increased risk of serious and/or clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occurs. 1. Indications and Usage VIDEX\u00ae EC (didanosine, USP), also known as ddI, in combination with other antiretroviral agents is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#Section_14) ]. 2. Dosage and Administration VIDEX EC should be administered on an empty stomach. VIDEX EC Delayed-Release Capsules should be swallowed intact. 2.1 Recommended Dosage (Adult and Pediatric Patients) The recommended total daily dose is based on body weight and is administered as one capsule given on a once-daily schedule as outlined in [Table 1](#_Reftable1). The recommended total daily dose to be administered once daily to pediatric patients weighing at least 20 kg who can swallow capsules is based on body weight (kg), consistent with the recommended adult dosing guidelines (see [Table 1](#_Reftable1)). Please consult the complete prescribing information for VIDEX (didanosine) Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution for dosage and administration of didanosine to pediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg or who can not swallow capsules. Body Weight Dose 20 kg to less than 25 kg 200 mg once daily 25 kg to less than 60 kg 250 mg once daily at least 60 kg 400 mg once daily 2.2 Renal Impairment Dosing recommendations for VIDEX EC and VIDEX Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution are different for patients with renal impairment. Please consult the complete prescribing information on administration of VIDEX (didanosine) Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution to patients with renal impairment. Adult Patients In adult patients with impaired renal function, the dose of VIDEX EC should be adjusted to compensate for the slower rate of elimination. The recommended doses and dosing intervals of VIDEX EC in adult patients with renal Based on studies using a buffered formulation of didanosine.| b Not suitable for use in patients less than 60 kg with CLcr less than 10 mL/min. An alternate formulation of didanosine should be used. at least 60 400 once daily 250 once daily 30-59 200 once daily 125 once daily 10-29 125 once daily 125 once daily less than 10 125 once daily b Pediatric Patients Urinary excretion is also a major route of elimination of didanosine in pediatric patients, therefore the clearance of didanosine may be altered in pediatric patients with renal impairment. Although there are insufficient data to recommend a specific dose adjustment of VIDEX EC in this patient population, a reduction in the dose should be considered (see [Table 2](#_Reftable2)). Patients Requiring Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) or Hemodialysis For patients requiring CAPD or hemodialysis, follow dosing recommendations for patients with creatinine clearance of less than 10 mL/min, shown in [Table 2](#_Reftable2). It is not necessary to administer a supplemental dose of didanosine following hemodialysis. 2.3 Dose Adjustment Concomitant Therapy with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate In patients who are also taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a dose reduction of VIDEX EC to 250 mg (adults weighing at least 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min) or 200 mg (adults weighing less than 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min) once daily taken together with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a light meal (400 kilocalories or less, 20% fat or less) or in the fasted state is recommended. The appropriate dose of VIDEX EC coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min has not been [see [Drug Interactions (7)](#Section_7) and [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#Section_12.3)]. Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.3)](#Section_5.3) and [Clinical and EC (didanosine, USP) Delayed-Release Capsules are white, opaque capsules as described below: - 125 mg capsule imprinted with \"BMS 125 mg 6671\" in Tan - 200 mg capsule imprinted with \"BMS 200 mg 6672\" in Green - 250 mg capsule imprinted with \"BMS 250 mg 6673\" in Blue - 400 mg capsule imprinted with \"BMS 400 mg 6674\" in Red 4. Contraindications VIDEX EC is contraindicated when coadministered with the following medications: - Stavudine- potential serious and/or life-threatening increase didanosine-associated toxicity [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#Section_12.3)]. didanosine (dideoxyadenosine 5-triphosphate) are increased. Fatal hepatic failure, well as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis have been reported in patients receiving both didanosine and ribavirin. 5. Warnings and Precautions 5.1 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis has occurred during therapy with didanosine used alone or in combination regimens in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. VIDEX EC should be suspended in patients with signs or symptoms of pancreatitis and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis. Patients treated with VIDEX EC in combination with stavudine may be at increased risk for pancreatitis; the coadministration VIDEX EC and [Contraindications When treatment with life-sustaining drugs known to cause pancreatic toxicity is required, suspension of VIDEX EC (didanosine) therapy is recommended. In patients with risk factors for pancreatitis, VIDEX EC should be used with extreme caution and only if clearly indicated. Patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, especially the elderly, are at increased risk of pancreatitis and should be followed closely. Patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for pancreatitis if treated without dose adjustment. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose related. [see hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including didanosine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. Coadministration and stavudine is contraindicated [see [Contraindications (4)](#Section_4) and [ Use in Specific Populations (8.1)](#Section_8.1)]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering VIDEX EC to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with VIDEX EC should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical signs or symptoms with or without laboratory findings consistent with symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.3 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of VIDEX EC have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. Coadministration of VIDEX EC and contraindicated; the combination of VIDEX EC and hydroxyurea be [see [Contraindications [Drug 5.4 Non-cirrhotic Portal Hypertension Postmarketing cases of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension have been reported, including cases leading to liver transplantation or death. Cases of didanosine-associated non-cirrhotic portal hypertension were confirmed by liver biopsy in patients with no evidence of viral hepatitis. Onset of signs and symptoms ranged from months to years after start of didanosine therapy. Common presenting features included elevated liver enzymes, esophageal varices, hematemesis, ascites, and splenomegaly. Patients receiving VIDEX EC should be monitored for early signs of portal hypertension (e.g., thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly) during routine medical visits. Appropriate laboratory testing including liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, albumin, complete blood count, and international normalized ratio (INR) and ultrasonography should be considered. VIDEX EC should be discontinued in patients with evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. 5.5 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving didanosine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, in patients with a history of neuropathy, or in patients being treated with neurotoxic drug therapy. Discontinuation of VIDEX EC should be considered in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy [see [Contraindications (4)](#Section_4) [, Adverse Reactions (6)](#Section_6), and [ Drug Interactions (7.2)](#Section_7.2) [].](#Section_7.2) 5.6 Retinal Changes and Optic Neuritis Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in patients taking didanosine. Periodic retinal examinations should be considered for patients receiving VIDEX EC [see [Adverse Reactions (6)](#Section_6) ]. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including VIDEX EC. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Lipoatrophy Treatment with VIDEX EC has been associated with loss of subcutaneous fat, which is most evident in the face, limbs, and buttocks. The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy are related to cumulative exposure, and is often not reversible when VIDEX EC treatment is stopped. Patients receiving VIDEX EC should be frequently examined and questioned for signs of lipoatrophy, and if feasible, therapy should be switched to an alternative regimen if there is suspicion of lipoatrophy. 6. Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections: - Pancreatitis [see Peripheral neuropathy [see [Warnings (5.5)](#Section_5.5)] - changes and optic neuritis [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.6)](#Section_5.6)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects Study AI454-152 was a 48-week, randomized, open-label study comparing VIDEX EC (400 mg once daily) plus stavudine (40 mg twice daily) plus nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) to zidovudine (300 mg) plus lamivudine (150 mg) combination tablets twice daily plus nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) in 511 treatment-naive patients. Selected clinical adverse reactions that occurred in combination with other antiretroviral agents are provided in [Table 3](#_Reftable3). |Adverse nelfinavir n=253 |a Median duration of treatment was 62 weeks in the VIDEX EC + stavudine + nelfinavir group and 61 weeks in the zidovudine/lamivudine + nelfinavir group.| b Percentages based on treated patients. c The incidences reported included all severity grades and all reactions regardless of causality. d Zidovudine/lamivudine combination tablet. * This event was not observed in this study arm.

In an early access program, pancreatitis resulting in death was observed in one patient who received VIDEX EC plus stavudine plus hydroxyurea plus efavirenz and Precautions (5)](#Section_5) ]. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose related. In phase 3 studies with buffered formulations of didanosine, incidence ranged from 1% to 10% with doses higher than are currently recommended and 1% to 7% with recommended dose. Selected laboratory abnormalities that occurred in a study of VIDEX EC in combination with other antiretroviral agents are shown in [Table 4](#_Reftable4). |Percent was 62 weeks in the VIDEX EC + stavudine + nelfinavir group and 61 weeks in the zidovudine/lamivudine + nelfinavir group.| b Percentages based on treated patients. c Zidovudine/lamivudine combination tablet. d Greater than 5 \u00d7 ULN for SGOT and SGPT, at least 2.1 at least 2.6 \u00d7 ULN for bilirubin (ULN = upper limit of normal).

Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in these patients were generally consistent with the safety profile of didanosine in adults. In pediatric phase 1 studies, pancreatitis occurred in 2 of 60 (3%) patients treated at entry doses below 300 mg/m2/day and in 5 of 38 (13%) patients treated at higher doses. In study ACTG 152, pancreatitis occurred in none of the 281 pediatric patients who received didanosine 120 mg/m2 every 12 hours and in less than 1% of the 274 pediatric patients who received didanosine 90 mg/m2 every 12 hours in combination with zidovudine [see [Clinical Studies (14)](#Section_14) ]. Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in pediatric patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of didanosine. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to VIDEX EC, or a combination of these factors.

Drug Interactions 7.1 Established Drug Interactions Clinical recommendations based on the results of drug interaction studies are listed in [Table 5](#_Reftable5). Pharmacokinetic results of drug interaction a Coadministration of didanosine with food decreases didanosine concentrations. Thus, although not studied, it is possible that coadministration with heavier meals could reduce didanosine concentrations further. ganciclovir didanosine concentration If there is no suitable alternative to ganciclovir, then use in combination with VIDEX EC with caution. Monitor for didanosine-associated toxicity. methadone didanosine concentration If coadministration of methadone and didanosine is necessary, the recommended formulation of didanosine is VIDEX EC. Patients should be closely monitored for adequate clinical response when VIDEX EC is coadministered with methadone, including monitoring for changes in HIV RNA viral load. Do not coadminister methadone with VIDEX pediatric powder due to significant decreases in didanosine concentrations. nelfinavir No interaction 1 hour after didanosine Administer 1 hour after VIDEX EC. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate didanosine concentration A dose reduction of VIDEX EC to the following dosage once daily taken together with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a light meal (400 kilocalories or less and 20% fat or less) or in the fasted state is recommended.a Patients should be monitored for didanosine-associated toxicities and clinical response. Exposure to didanosine is coadministered with Increased worsen didanosine-related clinical toxicities, including pancreatitis, fumarate with VIDEX EC should be undertaken with caution, and patients should be monitored closely for didanosine-related toxicities and clinical response. VIDEX EC should be suspended if signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia, or lactic acidosis and Precautions (5)](#Section_5) ]. Suppression of CD4 cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily. 7.2 Predicted Drug Interactions Predicted drug interactions with VIDEX EC are listed in [Table 6](#_Reftable6). |Drug or Drug Class||Effect||Clinical Comment| | Indicates increase.| a Only if other drugs are not available and if clearly indicated.

Use in Specific Populations 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to VIDEX EC during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263. Risk Summary Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. It is unclear if pregnancy augments the risk of lactic acidosis/hepatic steatosis is ]. Based on APR reports, congenital malformations were reported when administered during pregnancy. The prevalence of birth defects was 4.7% in the first trimester compared with 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) and 4.2% in the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR) (see Data). No pattern of defects was identified by the APR. Based on these findings, the clinical relevance is uncertain. The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 15 to 20%, respectively. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with didanosine at systemic exposures (AUC) up to 12 (rats) and 14 (rabbits) times the exposure in humans at the recommended daily human dose of VIDEX EC (see Data). Clinical Considerations Maternal Adverse Reactions Cases of lactic acidosis syndrome, sometimes fatal, have occurred in pregnant individuals using VIDEX EC in combination with stavudine. VIDEX EC is associated with an increased risk of acidosis syndrome/hepatic steatosis syndrome [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.2)](http://5.2%20%20%20%20%20Lactic%20Acidosis/Severe%20Hepatomegaly%20with%20Steatosis) ] Data Human Data Based on prospective reports to the APR of exposure to didanosine-containing regimens during pregnancy (including 427 exposed in the first trimester and 462 exposed in the second/third trimester), the prevalence of birth defects in live births was 4.7% (95% CI: 2.9% to 7.1%) CI: trimester exposure to didanosine-containing regimens compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP and 4.2% in the TBDR. Prospective reports from the APR of overall major birth defects in pregnancies exposed to VIDEX EC is compared with a U.S.background major birth defect rate. Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP and TBDR as the external comparator groups. Limitations of using external comparators include differences in methodology and populations, as well as confounding due to the underlying disease. Animal Data Didanosine was administered orally at up to 1000 mg per kg daily to pregnant rats and at up to 600 mg per kg daily to pregnant rabbits on gestation Days 7 to 17 and 6 to 18, respectively, and also to rats 14 days before mating through weaning. No adverse effects on embryo-fetal development (rats and rabbits) were observed up to the highest dose tested. During organogenesis, systemic exposures (AUC) to didanosine were up to 12 (rats) and 14.2 (rabbits) times the estimated human exposure at the recommended daily human dose. Didanosine and/or its metabolites are transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In the rat pre/postnatal development study, didanosine administered to pregnant rats reduced food intake and body weight gains in pups at a maternally toxic exposure (approximately 12 times the exposure at the recommended human dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. It is not known whether didanosine is present in human breast milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breastfed infant. When administered to lactating rats, didanosine was present in milk (see Data). Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants) and (3) adverse reactions in breastfed infants similar to those seen in adults, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving VIDEX EC. Data Didanosine and its metabolites were excreted into the milk of lactating rats following a single oral dose of 50 mg per kg on lactation Day 14, with milk concentrations 5 times that of maternal plasma concentrations at 8 and 24 hours post-dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use Use of didanosine in pediatric patients from 2 weeks of age through adolescence is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of didanosine in adult and pediatric patients studies in pediatric patients support use of VIDEX EC in pediatric patients who weigh at least 20 kg. 8.5 Geriatric Use In an Expanded Access Program using a buffered formulation of didanosine for the treatment of advanced HIV infection, patients aged 65 years and older had a higher frequency of pancreatitis (10%) than younger patients (5%) [see [Warnings and Precautions (5.1)](#Section_5.1) ]. Clinical studies of didanosine, including those for VIDEX EC, did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Didanosine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection. In addition, renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see [Dosage and Administration (2.2)](#Section_2.2) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min) may be at greater risk of toxicity from didanosine due to decreased drug clearance [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#Section_12.3) ]. A dose reduction is recommended for these patients [see [Dosage and Administration (2)](#Section_2) ]. 10. Overdosage There is no known antidote for didanosine overdosage. In phase 1 studies, in which buffered formulations of didanosine were initially administered at doses ten times the currently recommended dose, toxicities included: pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, hyperuricemia, and hepatic dysfunction. Didanosine is not dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis, although there is some clearance by hemodialysis [see [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)](#Section_12.3) ]. 11. Description VIDEX\u00ae EC is the brand name for an enteric-coated formulation of didanosine, USP, a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue against HIV-1. VIDEX EC Delayed-Release Capsules, containing enteric-coated beadlets, are available for oral administration in strengths of 125, 200, 250, and 400 mg of didanosine. The inactive ingredients in the beadlets include methacrylic acid copolymer, sodium hydroxide, sodium starch glycolate, and talc. The capsule shells contain gelatin and titanium dioxide. The capsules are imprinted with edible inks. Didanosine is also available in a powder formulation. Please consult the prescribing information for VIDEX (didanosine) Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution for additional information. The chemical name for didanosine is 2,3-dideoxyinosine. The structural formula is: Didanosine is a white crystalline powder with the molecular formula C10H12N4O3 and a molecular weight of 236.2. The aqueous solubility of didanosine at 25\u00b0 C and pH of approximately 6 is 27.3 mg/mL. Didanosine is unstable in acidic solutions. For example, at pH less than 3 and 37\u00b0 C, 10% of didanosine decomposes to hypoxanthine in less than 2 minutes. In VIDEX EC, an enteric coating is used to protect didanosine from degradation by stomach acid. 12. Clinical Pharmacology 12.1 Mechanism of Action Didanosine is an antiretroviral drug [see [Microbiology (12.4)](#Section_12.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic parameters of didanosine in HIV-infected adult and pediatric patients are summarized in [Table 7](#_Reftable7), by weight ranges that correspond to recommended doses ( [Table 1](#_Reftable1)). Didanosine is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations generally observed from 0.25 to 1.50 hours following oral dosing with a buffered formulation. Increases in plasma didanosine concentrations were dose proportional over the range of 50 to 400 mg. In adults, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) oral bioavailability following single oral dosing with a buffered formulation is 42 (\u00b112)%. After oral administration, the urinary recovery of didanosine is approximately 18 (\u00b18)% of the dose. The CSF-plasma ratio following IV administration is 21 (\u00b10.03)%. Steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly from values obtained after a single dose. Binding of didanosine to plasma proteins in vitro was low (less than 5%). Based on data from in vitro and animal studies, it is presumed that the metabolism of didanosine in man occurs by the same pathways responsible for the elimination of endogenous purines. |a The pharmacokinetic parameters (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) of didanosine were determined by a population pharmacokinetic model based on combined clinical studies.| Parametera Pediatrics Adults 20 kg to less than 25 kgn=10 25 kg to less than 60 kgn=17 At least 60 kgn=7 At least 60 kgn=44 Comparison of Didanosine Formulations In VIDEX EC, the active ingredient, didanosine, is protected against degradation by stomach acid by the use of an enteric coating on the beadlets in the capsule. The enteric coating dissolves when the beadlets empty into the small intestine, the site of drug absorption. With buffered formulations of didanosine, administration with antacid provides protection from degradation by stomach acid. In healthy volunteers, as well as subjects infected with HIV-1, the AUC is equivalent for didanosine administered as the VIDEX EC formulation relative to a buffered tablet formulation. The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of didanosine, administered as VIDEX EC, is reduced approximately 40% relative to didanosine buffered tablets. The time to the peak concentration (Tmax) increases from approximately 0.67 hours for didanosine buffered tablets to 2.0 hours for VIDEX EC. Effect of Food In the presence of food, the Cmax and AUC for VIDEX EC were reduced by approximately 46% and 19%, respectively, compared to the fasting state [see [Dosage and Administration (2)](#Section_2) ]. VIDEX EC should be taken on an empty stomach. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency: Data from two studies using a buffered formulation of didanosine indicated that the apparent oral clearance of didanosine decreased and the terminal elimination half-life increased as creatinine clearance decreased (see [Table 8](#_Reftable8)). Following oral administration, didanosine was not detectable in peritoneal dialysate fluid (n=6); recovery in hemodialysate (n=5) ranged from 0.6% to 7.4% of the dose over a 3-4 hour dialysis period. The absolute bioavailability of didanosine was not affected in patients requiring dialysis. [See [Dosage Administration = creatinine clearance. CL/F = apparent oral clearance. CLR = renal clearance.

Mean AUC and Cmax values following a single 400 mg dose of didanosine were approximately 13% and 19% higher, respectively, in patients with hepatic impairment compared to matched healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is needed, because a similar range and distribution of AUC and Cmax values was observed for subjects with hepatic impairment and matched healthy controls. [see [Dosage and Administration (2.3)](#Section_2.3) ]. Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of didanosine have been evaluated in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected pediatric patients from birth to adulthood. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted on pooled didanosine plasma concentration data from 9 clinical trials in 106 pediatric (neonate to 18 years of age) and 45 adult patients (greater than 18 years of age). Results showed that body weight is the primary factor associated with oral clearance. Based on the data analyzed, dosing schedule (once versus twice daily) and formulation (powder for oral solution, tablet, and delayed-release capsule) did not have an effect on oral clearance. Didanosine exposure similar to that at recommended adult doses can be achieved in pediatric patients with a weight-based dosing scheme Didanosine pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients over 65 years of age [see [Use in Specific Populations (8.5)](#Section_8.5) ]. Gender: The effects of gender on didanosine pharmacokinetics have not been studied.

Intracellularly, didanosine is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, dideoxyadenosine 5-triphosphate. Dideoxyadenosine 5-triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase both by competing with the natural substrate, deoxyadenosine 5-triphosphate, and by its incorporation into viral DNA causing termination of viral DNA chain elongation. Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture The anti-HIV-1 activity of didanosine was evaluated in a variety of HIV-1 infected lymphoblastic cell lines and monocyte/macrophage cell cultures. The concentration of drug necessary to inhibit viral replication by 50% (EC50) ranged from 2.5 to 10 M (1 M = 0.24 g/mL) in lymphoblastic cell lines and 0.01 to 0.1 M in monocyte/macrophage cell cultures. Resistance HIV-1 isolates with reduced sensitivity to didanosine have been selected in cell culture and were also obtained from patients treated with didanosine. Genetic analysis of isolates from didanosine-treated patients showed amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, and M184V in reverse transcriptase. The L74V substitution was most frequently observed in clinical isolates. Phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 isolates from 60 patients (some with prior zidovudine treatment) receiving 6 to 24 months of didanosine monotherapy showed that isolates from 10 of 60 patients exhibited an average of a 10-fold decrease in susceptibility to didanosine in cell culture compared to baseline isolates. Clinical isolates that exhibited a decrease in didanosine susceptibility harbored one or more didanosine resistance-associated substitutions. Cross-resistance HIV-1 isolates from 2 of 39 patients receiving combination therapy for up to 2 years with didanosine and zidovudine exhibited decreased susceptibility to didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine in cell (A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M) in reverse transcriptase. In data from clinical studies, the presence of thymidine analogue mutation substitutions (M41L, D67N, L210W, T215Y, K219Q) has shown to response to didanosine. 13. Nonclinical Toxicology 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats for 22 and 24 months, respectively. In the mouse study, initial doses of 120, 800, and 1200 mg/kg/day for each sex were lowered after 8 months to 120, 210, and 210 mg/kg/day for females and 120, 300, and 600 mg/kg/day for males. The two higher doses exceeded the maximally tolerated dose in females and the high dose exceeded the maximally tolerated dose in males. The low dose in females represented 0.68-fold maximum human exposure and the intermediate dose in males represented 1.7-fold maximum human exposure based on relative AUC comparisons. In the rat study, initial doses were 100, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day, and the high dose was lowered to 500 mg/kg/day after 18 months. The upper dose in male and female rats represented 3-fold maximum human exposure. Didanosine induced no significant increase in neoplastic lesions in mice or rats at maximally tolerated doses. Didanosine was positive in the following genetic toxicology assays: 1) the Escherichia coli tester strain assay; L5178Y/TK+/- mouse lymphoma mammalian cell gene mutation assay; 3) the in vitro chromosomal aberrations assay in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes; 4) the vitro chromosomal aberrations assay in Chinese Hamster Lung cells; and 5) the BALB/c 3T3 in vitro transformation assay. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in an Ames Salmonella bacterial mutagenicity assay or in rat and mouse in vivo micronucleus assays. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 12 and 14 times the estimated human exposure at the recommended daily human dose of VIDEX EC, respectively, and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to didanosine. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Evidence of a dose-limiting skeletal muscle toxicity has been observed in mice and rats (but not in dogs) following long-term (greater than 90 days) dosing with didanosine at doses that were approximately 1.2 to 12 times the estimated human exposure. The relationship of this finding to the potential of didanosine to cause myopathy in humans is unclear. However, human myopathy has been associated with administration of didanosine and other nucleoside analogues. 14. Clinical Studies 14.1 Adult Patients Study AI454-152 was a 48-week, randomized, open-label study comparing VIDEX EC (400 mg once daily) plus stavudine (40 mg twice daily) plus nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) to zidovudine (300 mg) plus lamivudine (150 mg) combination tablets twice daily plus nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) in 511 treatment-naive patients, with a mean CD4 cell count of 411 cells/mm3 (range 39 to 1105 cells/mm3) and a mean plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.71 log10 copies/mL (range 2.8 to 5.9 log10 copies/mL) at baseline. Patients were primarily males (72%) and Caucasian (53%) with a mean age of 35 years (range 18 to 73 years). The percentages of patients with HIV-1 RNA less than 400 and less than 50 copies/mL and outcomes of patients through 48 weeks are summarized in Figure 1 and [Table 13](#_Reftable13), respectively. |Outcome||Percent of Patients with HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies/mL| (less than 50 copies/mL) |VIDEX EC combination tablet.| b Corresponds to rates at Week 48 in Figure 1. c Subjects achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies/mL (less than 50 copies/mL) through Week 48. d Includes viral rebound at or before Week 48 and failure to achieve confirmed HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies/mL (less than 50 copies/mL) through Week 48. e Includes lost to follow-up, subject's withdrawal, discontinuation due to physician's decision, never progression 1% (1%) 2% (2%) Discontinued due to adverse 15% (16%) 14.2 Pediatric Patients Efficacy in pediatric patients was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, controlled study (ACTG 152, conducted 1991-1995) involving 831 patients 3 months to 18 years of age treated for more than 1.5 years with zidovudine (180 mg/m2 every 6 hours), didanosine (120 mg/m2 every 12 hours), or zidovudine (120 mg/m2 every 6 hours) plus didanosine (90 mg/m2 every 12 hours). Patients treated with didanosine or didanosine plus zidovudine had lower rates of HIV-1 disease progression or death compared with those treated with zidovudine alone. 16.
