An excerpt from his opinion piece: \"Vaccines are a central strategy in the control of infectious diseases in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that vaccines were the single most important public health achievement in the 20th century. But this remarkable achievement may be reversed in the 21st century unless we maintain high levels of appropriate vaccination. More than anything, dialogue is important - between scientists, doctors, families and advocates. If you have questions or concerns about measles and its vaccine, seek advice from knowledgeable practitioners whom you trust. Your family doctor or local public health district office will likely have the answers you seek about the safety and usefulness of vaccines.\" Read Dr. Whalen's entire Op-Ed in the [Athens Banner Herald](http://onlineathens.com/opinion/2015-03-04/whalen-vaccination-safe-necessary-public-health).
