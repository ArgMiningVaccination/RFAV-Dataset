Cosmetic acupuncture is an all-natural, minimally invasive therapy that helps you bring out your best self naturally. This holistic approach to beauty and skincare uses tiny needles and plant-based products to restore your skin's youth and vitality using your body's healing powers. Curious about how you could heal your acne, erase the signs of aging, and restore your natural glow with cosmetic acupuncture? Read on to learn everything you need to know about this natural beauty treatment! What is Cosmetic Acupuncture? Cosmetic acupuncture is an ancient procedure that has gained popularity in our modern age. It includes techniques like facial rejuvenation acupuncture, microneedling, and nanoneedling - all of which have their unique benefits and purposes. Cosmetic acupuncture is a natural way to improve the look, feel, and health of your skin by tapping into your body's own healing potential. This holistic approach is why cosmetic acupuncture is so different from other beauty treatments like Botox or dermal fillers. Rather than just treating the surface level, we restore the body's natural healing and anti-aging powers. What Can Cosmetic Acupuncture Treat? - Wrinkles - Fine lines, crow's feet - Undereye bags or dark circles - Dark spots, sun spots, uneven tone - Acne, adult acne, cystic acne, hormonal acne - Rosacea, eczema, psoriasis - Sagging, loose, or thinning mature skin - Neck and jawline sagging, jowls - Dryness, patching - Scarring What is Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture? [Facial rejuvenation acupuncture](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19338843/) is a subset of cosmetic acupuncture that uses tiny acupuncture needles to stimulate specific points on the face and body. Unlike botox treatments, there is no medicine or chemicals on facial rejuvenation acupuncture needles - they simply work by boosting your body's healing processes to help restore your skin's natural beauty. The stimulation and placement of these needles focus on your most significant areas of concern (such as wrinkles or acne). The treatment also addresses the root causes of your skin issues or other health conditions. The treatment also includes full-body relaxation acupuncture, which addresses the root causes of your skin issues or other health conditions. This is partially what makes cosmetic acupuncture such a holistic solution - it addresses mind, body, and face with a comprehensive Traditional Chinese medicine approach. What is Microneedling? [Microneedling](https://www.pnwacu.com/services/cosmetic-acupuncture) is a technique that developed from the plum-blossom tool of ancient Chinese medicine. Today's sleek, motorized version boosts collagen production, reverses wrinkles, heals scars, and erases the signs of aging with faster results. How does microneedling work? Tiny microneedles trigger the skin's natural healing process, which lays down fibroblasts in the skin's layers. These fibroblasts increase collagen production to improve the skin's natural tone. Then, we go further and apply powerful plant stem cells and herbal serums that deeply penetrate and heal the skin. The result is fast, fresh, younger-looking skin after a complete series of treatments. What is Nanoneedling? Not quite ready for a microneedling treatment? [Nano needling](https://www.pnwacu.com/services/cosmetic-acupuncture) is for you. Nano needling offers similar results to microneedling but is even less invasive. It doesn't penetrate as deep into the skin layers as microneedling but still provides amazing natural results. How does nano needling work? Nano needling works similarly to microneedling. It stimulates the skin's natural healing process, which triggers collagen production and new layers of healthy skin. What about skincare products? Of course, using skincare products that help heal the skin and reduce fine lines and wrinkles is an essential part of holistic skincare. But it's even more critical after cosmetic acupuncture, microneedling, or nano needling treatments. Why? Because after a facial rejuvenation session, your skin is a blank slate. It becomes hundreds of times [more absorbent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976400/) to anything that touches the surface. For this reason, it is crucial that you only use the best plant-based skincare products with natural ingredients after a cosmetic acupuncture treatment. Your session at PNW Cosmetic Acupuncture may also include light therapy, hyaluronic acid, plant-based stem cells, cruelty-free products, and herbal topicals with every session for the best results. How Does Cosmetic Acupuncture Work? Like regular acupuncture, cosmetic acupuncture follows the principles of Chinese medicine and the various acupuncture channels and points. The beauty of cosmetic acupuncture is that it helps your body truly heal from the inside out. Unlike other conventional beauty procedures, cosmetic acupuncture doesn't just mask symptoms or hide imperfections. It helps to restore the body's natural balance to improve your overall health. You might even find that your cosmetic acupuncture treatments reduce wrinkles as well as issues like headaches, indigestion, insomnia, anxiety, and [stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4203477/), too! On a more microscopic level, [cosmetic acupuncture increases collagen and elasticity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23983778/) in the skin. The tiny needles create microtraumas that the body rushes to heal. In doing so, the skin's fibroblasts lay down a protective layer of collagen and replace damaged skin cells with fresh, healthy ones. Cosmetic acupuncture also [increases blood flow](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3745857/) to the face, flushing the skin with healing nutrients and oxygen. The facial muscles relax to instantly smooth fine lines and help prevent new wrinkles from forming. Benefits of Facial Rejuvenation - It boosts natural [collagen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3745857/)production and smoothes fine lines. - It relaxes the [facial muscles](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/424313/)and prevents wrinkles. - It improves blood flow and hydration to the face for naturally soft and glowing skin. - It improves the skin's detoxification and reduces [inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5653339/).

Yes, facial acupuncture is safe for most skin types and completely toxin-free.
