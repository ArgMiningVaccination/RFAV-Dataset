Benefits of Meditation Yoga practices are most often joined by meditation, and the two of them are growing in popularity as people realize the benefits. [Meditation](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-benefits-of-meditation#section10) is a practice in which you focus your mind and re-route your thoughts to a desired path.

Starting Out Yoga and meditation are beneficial for everyone \u2014 no matter what your age. And one of the best parts about these practices is that you can start and maintain them basically anywhere and anytime. For instance, if you would rather exercise at home, carve out your own [meditation space](https://leftbrainbuddha.com/create-a-meditation-space-in-your-home/) with enough room to do your yoga poses. Make sure it's clutter-free, and add any elements that will make it relaxing (e.g., candles, flowers, soft lighting, landscape art, etc.). If you want to add a social element, consider joining a yoga class. Along with providing community, classes can serve as a motivation to follow through with your routine even when you don't feel like it. Maintaining Mindfulness It's important to understand that \u2014 whether it's for health reasons, a scheduling conflict, or some other reason \u2014 there may be times when you can't do your poses. But you can always practice [mindfulness](https://www.verywellmind.com/mindfulness-meditation-88369). This is perhaps when having your own meditation space at home proves most useful. You don't need any special equipment or memberships to meditate. If you start to feel stressed or anxious, taking a [few minutes](https://www.mindful.org/a-five-minute-breathing-meditation/) to recalibrate your mind; it can change the whole course of your day. Even if you feel great, dedicating five or 10 minutes a few times a day can keep you in the right frame of mind. When it comes to your overall health, yoga and meditation are some of the most effective habits you can incorporate into your everyday life. Do your research to unpack the plethora of benefits offered by both, and consider making your own space at home or joining a class. Also, remember that you can meditate anytime and anywhere. If you're looking to improve your physical, mental, and emotional health as you age, yoga and meditation should be at the top of your list of things to try. "}
