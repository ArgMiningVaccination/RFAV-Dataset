That's a question we get asked a lot at The Which Doctor, especially as we offer solutions from both to our clients. - Which is better for you? - Are they actually the same? - Can you mix them? The answer is that there's no one rule for everyone. Both Naturopathic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine have a number of modalities and ways of helping your overall health. There are, however, some key differences (and similarities!) between both which you should be aware of before visiting a Naturopath or Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner. What is Naturopathy / a Naturopath? At its core, Naturopathy is a system that uses a variety of natural remedies to support many different illnesses and conditions by treating the person as a whole vs. individual symptoms. Your Naturopath will ask you questions about your lifestyle, diet, stress levels and health history in order to get a full understanding of your unique body. History of Natural Medicine Natural Medicine gained popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries - but many of the practices are actually rooted in Medicine developed in Ancient Greece. Traditional practitioners believe that the body can resist and recover from disease with the aid of nature. Modern Naturopathy uses many healing traditions common 150 years ago, but also combines them with new techniques such as blood tests and hair samples. How Does It Work? Naturopathic medicine takes the whole person into account. Your practitioner will assess your general health in order to treat your pain or condition. They'll then recommend the best remedies which may include vitamins, Western herbs, dietary changes, and stress management tips. It's also common for alternative medicine to include massage and touch. Natural Medicine At The Which Doctor At The Which Doctor, we offer a variety of Natural Medicine treatments and techniques to boost overall health and well-being (yes, that's why we always get asked the question around what makes us the same or different to a Naturopath). We understand that every body is different and we believe it's important to offer our clients a range of different [treatments from both the West and the East](https://www.thewhichdoctor.com.au/why-the-which-doctor-east-meets-west/). We look at your body as a whole and take into account your genetic, environmental and biological information to help you meet your health goals. Our main interests lie in women's health and fertility, and whilst we'll explore the use of Chinese herbs and acupuncture from Traditional Chinese Medicine to support your wellbeing, there are a number of essential vitamins and nutrients from the West that we can recommend to help with hormonal imbalances and particular health concerns. What is Traditional Chinese Medicine? Chinese Medicine is an ancient form of medicine that has been used for more than 2,500 years! Similarly to Natural Medicine, Chinese Medicine focuses on the person as a whole, rather than just finding a solution for an individual symptom. History of Traditional Chinese Medicine For centuries, Chinese Medicine was the standard medical therapy in China. It was based on thousands of years of research and teachings from emperors and practitioners. In the 17th century, there was a slow decline in traditional therapies due to the rise of Western Medicine. Many people started to believe that ancient methods were steeped in superstition. In fact, in 1929 it was proposed to abolish Chinese medicine in China altogether! In the 1950s, however, the Chinese government opened many Traditional Medicine research facilities. Doctors and practitioners from around the world went to study the benefits of Chinese Medicine. It's now a well-known alternative medical practice in many countries. How does it work? The fundamental principle of Traditional Chinese Medicine is that the body is made up of many channels (meridians) which transport the body's natural energy (Qi). These meridians can become blocked meaning that there is an imbalance in energy flow which can cause pain, disease, or health problems. Your Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner will ask you a number of questions to understand your full health history. They may also carry out a tongue or pulse diagnosis as well as look at how bright your eyes are. They will then recommend a number of treatments such as acupuncture, cupping, Chinese Herbal Medicine and moxibustion. These treatments help to bring the blocked energy to the surface and allow your body to naturally restore balance. Traditional Chinese Medicine at The Which Doctor From our South Yarra clinic, our trained practitioners can offer a wide range of treatments to help a number of women's health conditions. We take our time to really understand the factors at play when it comes to your health. By asking specific questions and doing a number of different diagnoses, we can determine the best treatment for you. We may recommend a unique blend of [Chinese herbs](https://www.thewhichdoctor.com.au/treatments/chinese-herbal-medicine/), [acupuncture](https://www.thewhichdoctor.com.au/treatments/acupuncture-melbourne/), [cupping](https://www.thewhichdoctor.com.au/treatments/melbourne-cupping-therapy/) or a mixture. The Bottom Line - What Are The Key Differences between a Naturopath and a Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner? Let's first look at the similarities. Both alternative medicine practices look at the person as a whole. Rather than treating a symptom (which Western Medicine concentrates on), these therapies understand that there can be multiple causes of one condition. Both can use Western technologies such as blood tests to complement the natural healing recommendations. Becoming either a Naturopath or a Chinese Medicine practitioner requires extensive studying and experience, with some core qualifications below: Naturopath Qualifications: - Bachelor Degree in Health Science (Naturopathy) - Registered with the Australian Register of Naturopaths and Herbalists (ARONAH) Traditional Chinese Medicine Qualifications: - Bachelor Degree in Health Science (Chinese Medicine) - Registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) The [practitioners at The Which Doctor](https://www.thewhichdoctor.com.au/about-us/) have all spent many years gaining qualifications and experience around the world to offer the best health solutions to their clients. Some think of Naturopath vs Chinese Medicine practitioner as West vs East. Whilst that's certainly true when it comes to origin, many people think they need to choose between them. We disagree. At The Which Doctor, your health and wellbeing is the most important thing. This is why we offer a combination of solutions from both. We want to give you a well-rounded treatment that is as unique as you, your body and wellbeing goals. Thinking about visiting a Naturopath or Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner?
