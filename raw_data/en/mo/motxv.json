Weill Department of Medicine. The Department remains dedicated to its missions, which are centered around clinical care, health equity, biomedical research, and education. In this report you will find a detailed overview of activities that span 2021 for all of our department's divisions. The report also includes faculty honors and awards, leadership biographies, information on our residency training program in internal medicine, as well as featured news stories. The COVID-19 pandemic again influenced our entire year as we saw the persistence and adaptability of the SARS-CoV-2 despite our enhanced ability to prevent infection via the development of vaccines and other therapeutics. Still, the Department was able to grow significantly in all areas, while, at the same time, caring for significant numbers of patients affected by COVID-19. Our clinical volumes rebounded and grew nicely across all areas and the continued presence of significant video visit volume allowed us to continue to provide flexible access to our communities. Our research growth was again substantial and also included a new T32 training program in cardiovascular disease as well as a host of new awards to faculty across all of our divisions. Finally, our training programs continued their tradition of excellence, recruiting candidates from throughout the United States and globally to train and learn in a highly innovative educational environment. While we undoubtedly will face many additional challenges going forward, the strength of the faculty and staff in the Weill Department of Medicine has provided a force that has allowed us to continue to move forward and to succeed. Please enjoy our annual report and the remarkable accomplishments of the Weill Department of Medicine.Sincerely, Anthony Hollenberg, M.D. Sanford I. Weill Chair of Medicine Joan and Sanford I. Weill Department of MedicineWeill Cornell Medical College Physician-in-Chief NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medicine Center 1What regulates gastrointestinal health and chronic inflammation in the gut? To answer this question, Dr. Gregory F. Sonnenberg has been exploring how we develop a beneficial, or tolerogenic, relationship with the trillions of microbes that line the gut, known as the microbiota. These trillions of microbes hold the answers as to why someone may develop a particular condition or disease, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), or the fourth most common cancer in the U.S., colorectal cancer. With a focus on a subset of immune cells - ILC3s (group 3 innate lymphoid cells) - the Sonnenberg Lab has been rapidly unraveling a cascade of discoveries related not only to IBD and colorectal cancer, but, more recently, to airway inflammation and multiple sclerosis (MS). Located in the Belfer Research Building, the Sonnenberg Lab is a hub for state-of-the-art research, productive collaborations, and the training of a new generation of diverse and high-tech investigators. 2021 represented the best in all three of these areas, beginning with the seminal discovery that ILC3s not only maintain healthy gut bacteria but provide protection against colorectal cancer. It was found that this protection is due, in part, to the role that ILC3s play in maintaining a healthy dialogue between the immune system and gut microbes. To prove their findings, the researchers used a mouse model in which they disrupted functionality of ILC3s. The result was aggressive colon cancer with effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies greatly diminished. \"As colorectal cancer is associated with chronic gut inflammation and a major disruption of the normal microbiome, the finding that ILC3s protect against colorectal cancer holds potential for improved patient therapies,\" explains Dr. Sonnenberg. On the heels of these findings, the Sonnenberg Lab posed a new question: Why do cancers in some patients respond well to immunotherapies, while others do not? Collaborating with Dr. Manish Shah, Director, Gastrointestinal Oncology Program, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, and lead-author Dr. Jeremy Goc, a research associate in the Sonnenberg Lab, Dr. Sonnenberg and colleagues began to analyze ILC3s in colorectal tumors and pre-cancerous polyps in both humans and mice. While Dr. Sonnenberg and Dr. Goc worked at the bench, Dr. Shah, who serves as co-Director of the Center for Advanced Digestive Care at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, provided the tumor samples from patients. It was found that ILC3s in cancerous tissues were relatively depleted, as compared with healthy tissues, and, fundamentally, their functions were altered. In addition, the investigators observed that the ability of ILC3s to regulate a specific immune cell subset, called T cells, was significantly disrupted. Disruptions in this dialogue between ILC3s and T cells led, in turn, to a rise in inflammation in the gut that modified the gut microbiome. This was a seminal finding, as these modifications resulted in a decrease in the levels of T cells, which are necessary to fight tumors. Through the use of mouse models, it was also revealed that by blocking ILC3 signaling, tumors were relatively unresponsive to a cancer immunotherapy called anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Research in the Sonnenberg Lab had now confirmed that normal functionality of ILC3s plays a pivotal role in keeping gut microbiome healthy, preventing colorectal cancer, and in aiding the success of a cancer immunotherapy. To advance these findings, the lab has begun to ask key questions for the future. For example, could gut microbiota be sampled to predict tumor progression, or to predict responsiveness to immunotherapies? Could healthy microbiota be used to improve treatment responsiveness to more patients? By the end of 2021, more discoveries were on the way, including an entirely new pathway related to ILC3s; the The Sonnenberg Lab: ILC3s Yield a Cascade of Discoveries Dr. Gregory F. Sonnenberg is a scientist in the Jill Roberts Institute for Research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Weill Cornell Medicine, an Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology in Medicine, and Head of Basic Research within the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, WDOM. 2finding that ILC3s control airway inflammation by limiting T cell responses to allergens and microbes; and a connection between ILC3s and brain-related disorders. Whereas the investigators had previously established that ILC3s could trigger beneficial responses in the gut for IBD and colorectal cancer, their latest discovery showed that ILC3s could have an opposite effect. They had uncovered a subset of ILC3s that circulate in the bloodstream with the ability to infiltrate the brain. And, in a mouse model, this distinct subset was found to trigger T cells to attack myelinated nerve fibers which led to MS-like symptoms. Reinforcing this unexpected finding, the investigators observed a similar inflammatory ILC3 response in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients. More breakthroughs followed, including that MS-like disease in mice could be prevented by removing a key molecule, called MHCII, from the ILC3s. This approach essentially blocked the cells' ability to activate myelin-attacking T cells. It was further shown in mice that ILC3s reside in other tissues in the body and could be programmed to counter the activity of brain-infiltrating T cells and to prevent the MS-like condition. \"This work has the potential to inform our understanding of, and potential treatments for, a broad variety of conditions involving T-cell infiltration of the brain,\" says Dr. Sonnenberg, who collaborated on the project with lead-author John Benji Grigg, a Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences doctoral candidate in the Sonnenberg Lab, and Dr. Timothy Vartanian, Professor of Neuroscience, Feil Family Brain and Mind Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, Professor of Neurology and Chief, Division of Multiple Sclerosis and Neuro-immunology, Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. By the start of 2022, the Sonnenberg Lab had published another key advance. Using an advanced technique called single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitative tissue imaging, they had delineated a new pathway in ILC3 that involved a growth factor (HB-EGF) that protects against the effects of IBD. Their findings demonstrated that ILC3s are the dominant driver of HB- EGF and that HB-EGF can powerfully counter the harmful effects of TNF. This was a welcome breakthrough, as TNF is an inflammatory immune protein and major driver of intestinal inflammation. The team's next steps will be focused on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this novel pathway and its implications in intestinal health, inflammation, and cancer. \"We have identified the cascade of signaling factors that occurs downstream of TNF and causes ILC3 to switch on HB-EGF production. We have also observed this same cascade in human ILC3s. Identifying the significance of this pathway is a good first step, and we're now thinking about how we might manipulate this pathway to benefit IBD patients,\" says Dr. Sonnenberg, who collaborated on the study with Dr. Lei Zhou, lead- author and postdoctoral associate in the Sonnenberg Lab. As the cascade of discoveries continues, the Sonnenberg Lab remains dedicated to employing all means of state-of-the-art strategies towards improved patient care. The Sonnenberg Lab L to R: Dr. Sonnenberg and Dr. Jeremy Goc 3Dr. Erica Phillips, the WDOM's Jack Fishman Associate Professor of Clinical Cancer Prevention, has been a champion in the field of healthcare equity for more than 20 years. Throughout her career, she has remained focused on equity for minority and underserved populations while employing creative strategies and solutions for a wide array of health conditions from obesity and weight management, to heart disease, and cancers. A leader in evidence-based research, Dr. Phillips has forged a close and productive relationship with communities in New York City while establishing trust and strong ties with community residents, organizations, and providers. Her research has been targeted to three areas: behavioral interventions to promote healthier lifestyles in high-risk populations; understanding the social determinants that drive differences in morbidity and mortality between certain racial/ethnic groups; and strategies and tools, grounded in the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), to create larger scientific programs to address health disparities. Dr. Phillips serves as Associate Director of Community Outreach and Engagement for the Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine and as co-Associate Director of Community Engagement for the Cornell Center for Health Equity. \"Dr. Phillips has done an exceptional job of leading the Meyer Cancer Center's community outreach and engagement efforts and has been instrumental in building our partnerships with community stakeholders. The programs she and her team are implementing will have a direct impact on reducing the burden of cancer in our communities,\" says Dr. Lew Cantley, former director of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center. \"A tireless advocate for community engaged research over her entire career, Dr. Phillips has been a superb leader of the Community Engagement Core of the Cornell Center for Health Equity,\" says Dr. Monika Safford, Chief, Division of Internal Medicine, WDOM. Dr. Phillips is the former Associate Medical Director of the now Community Health Network's Long Island City Health Center where she practiced between 2003 through 2011 before transitioning to Weill Cornell Internal Medical Associates (WCIMA). She is one of the founding physicians of WCIMA's Weight Management Practice, where along with NYP's Ambulatory Care Network dietician, the team supports behavioral lifestyle counseling combined with pharmacological support to aid patients seeking weight loss in order to improve their quality of life. Since its inception in 2009, the practice has provided this important clinical service to a diverse patient population regardless of insurance type. In support of the department's tripartite mission, Dr. Phillips has played an instrumental role in mentoring numerous trainees including medical students, residents, fellows and junior faculty members within and outside of the WDOM. For the past three years, Dr. Phillips has served as the Director of the Scholars in Health Equity which is an initiative of the Weill Cornell Diversity Center of Excellence. In addition to her clinical and educational service to the department, Dr. Phillips is also the co-Chair of the WDOM's Racial Justice Equity Task Force (RJETF). Alongside Dr. Susana Morales, and a multitude of trainees, faculty, staff and Dr. Erica Phillips: A Champion for Change in Healthcare Delivery and Healthcare Equity After earning her M.D. from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and completing residency training at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Phillips joined the faculty of the WDOM's Division of General Internal Medicine. She completed a Fellowship in Health Services Research at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) and an M.S. in Epidemiology from the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences. 4community based organizers, the task force has made the desegregation of care in the ambulatory setting one of their top priorities. For historical reasons there has been fragmented patient care based on payor. Hence, based on insurance, ambulatory patients at WCM may be seen in separate physical spaces and by different providers in the same facility. The RJETF is calling for a halt to this practice. As a health services researcher, Dr. Phillips was one of the only non-basic science-oriented WDOM faculty to receive a grant from Weill Cornell Medicine in support of her research on COVID-19 which is investigating the role of social determinants of health on long COVID symptomatology in comparison to actual disease severity. One of Dr. Phillips' first major research projects was a rapid venue-intensive-vaccination program of hard-to-reach populations (e.g., substance abusers, sex workers, undomiciled) conducted in East Harlem and the South Bronx. The project, funded by the National Institute of Drug Abuse and housed at the CDC Urban Center at the New York Academy of Medicine, is where Dr. Phillips was introduced and mentored by experts in the field of CBPR (Drs. David Vlahov and Sandro Galea). Dr. Phillips later became an integral member and co-Investigator for \"SCALE: Small Changes Lasting Effects,\" a $6.5 million U01 grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The project tested the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention in at risk adults in Harlem and the South Bronx. She also served as the former co-Director of the community engagement core of Weill Cornell's NIH-funded Comprehensive Center of Excellence in Disparities Research and Community Engagement, a center focused on improving health outcomes among Black and Latinx adults. Dr. Phillips designed one of the first studies to combine a lifestyle intervention with acceptance-based therapy to investigate emotional eating as a potential barrier to optimal energy balance in Afro-Caribbean breast cancer survivors. Most recently, she designed a lifestyle intervention that aims to leverage the social network of individuals seeking weight loss who often succumb to the social undermining of health behaviors within their families and communities. Dr. Phillips collaborates with a cadre of investigators locally and nationally. She is one of the Principal Investigators of a new multi-institutional NYC center that aims to reduce health disparities among individuals living with multi-chronic diseases. Funded by the National Institute of Minority Health Disparities, the center's work focuses on a multifaceted approach that intervenes on structural, community, family and individual level determinants of health and well-being. Over the past five years the infrastructure that her team has built in establishing the office of community outreach and engagement for the MCC has been instrumental in the receipt of several awards tied to reducing cancer disparities in marginalized populations across the cancer centers catchment area. These include two grants totaling $1.3 million (over five years) to establish the Blood Cancer Research Initiative Developing Greater Engagement with Community Patients (BRIDGE) program and a recent Department of Defense award that will pilot a highly portable and rapid prostate cancer point-of-care test. Dr. Phillips is a recent recipient of a Healthy Equity Award from NYP Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, the inaugural recipient of The Marie Metoyer, M.D. Award for Excellence in Community Service, and she was recently inducted as a fellow of the American College of Physicians.

Coinciding with his arrival to Weill Cornell Medicine, Dr. Jones had been invited to give the plenary basic science lecture at the 22nd International AIDS Conference held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. He had been tasked with conveying scientific findings on HIV-AIDS to a lay audience. The event hosted 18,000 delegates from 160 countries, dignitaries from around the world, and key leaders in the field of HIV-AIDS. \"The challenge, which seemed rather daunting at first, was to reasonably represent two broad fields of study - cure and vaccine - at a level that was both accessible to a lay audience and perceived as up-to-date and balanced by experts,\" says Dr. Jones. His lecture received many positive responses on Twitter with comments such as \"the clearest talk on the subject of HIV cure and HIV vaccines I have ever heard.\" As Dr. Jones explained in 2018, and which remains essentially true today, although antiretroviral drugs (ART) can contain HIV and suppress the virus in the blood to practically undetectable levels, the drugs cannot completely eradicate HIV from a person's body. This is due to the persistence of viral reservoirs. Known as HIV latency, this reservoir consists of HIV-infected cells that stay dormant and can remain undetectable for years, even decades, while ART is being administered. However, if antiretroviral drugs are discontinued, the virus will rebound from the reservoir. Using the story of the little Dutch boy (representing ART), who plugs the overflowing dam with his finger until help arrives, Dr. Jones provided details on two lines of strategy: either drain the reservoir or reinforce the dam. These strategies opened two possible options: sterilizing the reservoir with a technique known as \"kick-and-kill\" (meaning draining and eliminating all infected cells in a person) or, alternatively, strengthening the immune response so that the HIV-infected cells do not do damage. Dr. Jones also brought to light the critical knowledge that genetic material of the HIV virus can be defective - and at a rate of up to 98%. This illuminating fact about the genetics of HIV had provided Dr. Jones and colleagues a portal in the dam to closely assess defective vs. effective genetic material. At the time of his lecture in the Netherlands, there was only one patient, Timothy Ray Brown, who had been considered \"cured\" of HIV. More recently, a patient, who had both cancer and HIV, was treated at Weill Cornell Medicine with a blood stem cell transplant (involving a unique cord blood that contained an HIV resistant variant). As part of an NIH-funded clinical trial led by physician- scientists in the WDOM (Drs. Koen Van Besien, Jingmei In Pursuit of a Cure for HIV: Dr. Brad Jones Appointed as Principal Investigator of $28.5 Million NIH-funded Grant (REACH) Dr. R. Bradley \"Brad\" Jones is an Associate Professor of Immunology in Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, WDOM. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto and continued his work as a postdoctoral fellow at the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard. 6Hsu, and Marshall Glesby), the patient has been free of cancer for more than four years and there has been no sign of reemergence of HIV to date. However, the procedure is considered too risky for HIV-positive patients who otherwise would not need such a transplant. Although both of these examples represent good news, there are still many individuals who have not achieved a cure for HIV or have limited, if any, access to ART. In addition, life-long reliance on ART involves a host of challenging side effects. Dr. Jones believes a cure for HIV is within reach... Throughout his career, Dr. Jones has been focused on the relationship between HIV and the human immune system, primarily studying cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells. Located in the Belfer Research Building, the Jones laboratory is known for its novel and creative strategies that employ state-of-the-art techniques, from in vitro experiments using a bank of clinical HIV samples, to humanized mice as pre-clinical models of HIV infection, and through to clinical trials. Since 2016, Dr. Jones has been co-leading, along with Dr. Douglas Nixon, Professor of Immunology in Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, the NIH-funded Martin Delaney \"BELIEVE\" collaboratory. His studies with BELIEVE have focused on maximally harnessing the \"cytotoxic T-cell\" arm of the immune system to contribute to the elimination of the HIV reservoirs that persist in individuals on long-term ART therapy. As of 2021, Dr. Jones is serving as Principal Investigator of REACH (Research Enterprise to Advance a Cure for HIV), a part of The Martin Delaney Collaboratories. Formed in late 2020, and dedicated to finding a cure for HIV, REACH builds upon investigative elements of BELIEVE. REACH involves 18 different institutions and is co-led by Dr. Marina Caskey of The Rockefeller University. The reach of REACH is extensive with studies focused on HIV subtypes A and D in Uganda, as well as subtype B in Mexico. \"The REACH award represents a remarkable vote of confidence and recognition of Weill Cornell Medicine as an international hub of HIV cure research,\" said Dr. Jones. \"With this funding we will leverage novel technological and analytical methods to redefine how the immune system interacts with the HIV reservoir in people on therapy. We want to understand the role that this immune failure plays in HIV persistence and develop ways to overcome it. This is a major aim of the grant and will be built upon mechanistic investigations using multi-omics platforms. Ultimately, we seek to find a cure that will eradicate the HIV virus from the body and/or suppress the virus by boosting the immune system. Either outcome would eliminate the need for lifelong medication.\" One of the benefits resulting from studies on HIV has been a number of breakthrough findings involving other diseases, including cancer and neurological conditions. Recently, Dr. Jones, who has been working for many years on T-cell therapy approaches to HIV, published a paper in Blood that showed T-cells from recovered COVID-19 patients can be successfully multiplied in the lab and maintain the ability to effectively target (fight) proteins that are key to the function of COVID-19. Furthermore, it was found that people who recover from COVID-19 have T-cells that recognize and target viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2, giving them immunity from the virus because those T-cells are primed to fight it. It is hoped that findings from this study could lead to adoptive immunotherapy in an effort to protect people who are vulnerable to COVID-19. (This study was in collaboration with Children's National Hospital.) \"Just as HIV research has benefited other fields like cancer, the seeds of discoveries we are sowing now will drift into the future to form the basis of cures in the future,\" said Dr. Jones in 2018. Fast forward to 2022, \"We have learned so much about how HIV persists over the past decade. The next five years will be so critical to addressing the remaining gaps in knowledge, and then using this deeper understanding to design next generation therapeutic approaches. With the ongoing support of the NIH and the communities of people living with HIV, I do believe that a cure for HIV is within reach.\" Four years after giving his plenary talk at the 22nd International AIDS Conference, Dr. Jones is leading the Basic/ Translational Science Track for the 2022 AIDS Conference to be held in Montreal, Canada. He also serves on the Steering Committee for the International AIDS Society Global Scientific Strategy; his work with this society, involving a consensus document on research priorities for an HIV cure, was published in Nature Medicine. Dr. Jones is currently in the recruitment phase for a new clinical trial that is using yet another promising approach to achieving HIV cure or remission.

His team seeks to develop and design effective strategies to prevent, slow, or eliminate these complications, while, in parallel, pioneering discoveries for achieving a cure for HIV. Dr. Ndhlovu was recruited to the Division of Infectious Disease, WDOM, in 2019. Upon his arrival, he swiftly established the Laboratory of HIV Immunopathogenesis in the Belfer Research Building. Employing state-of-the-art immunology and virology techniques, a major focus of his research, which covers many disciplines, is identifying neuro-immune pathways that are associated with brain injury in people living with HIV to illuminate the complex pathogenesis of HIV and aging. This work has opened the door to developing new improved approaches to treat these co-morbidities. To study mechanisms that underly such complicated processes, Dr. Ndhlovu has employed a number of novel innovations including epigenetics combined with machine-learning analyses in his research that spans more than 20 years. Epigenetics, as Dr. Ndhlovu explains, is the study of how behaviors and environment can cause changes in how genes are expressed and work in cells but do not change an individual's DNA. This is essentially how an organism grows and develops through carefully orchestrated chemical reactions that activate and deactivate parts of the genes at strategic areas. They have been shown to be critical in normal brain function, and Dr. Ndhlovu and his team have revealed that epigenetic mechanisms may be key events in HIV brain injury. His team is also developing next generation organoids 'mini-brains' to model human brain development in an effort to pioneer new discoveries that will aim to improve brain health in those aging with HIV. Dr. Ndhlovu's journey in medicine began in Zambia at time when the HIV epidemic was raging and this spurred his interest in immunology. His early research identified how several retroviruses (HIV, SIV and HTLV-1) drive T cell and NK cell immune exhaustion through negative checkpoint pathways, and he has developed and investigated immunotherapeutics to rescue these defective immune responses. Dr. Ndhlovu has completed several landmark publications, including how the microbiome influences immunotherapy in HIV. In more recent work, he has identified immunoepigenetic signatures in blood of acute HIV infection, HIV associated cognitive decline, HIV reservoirs, including expansion to severe COVID-19 disease, and HIV/COVID-19 co-infection. These discoveries are providing some of the most comprehensive host Dr. Lishomwa \"Lish\" Ndhlovu Leads a Bench-to-Bedside Research Program epigenome analyses in these disease states to the field in a quest for advancing effective interventions. After completing medical training in Zambia, Dr. Ndhlovu \"wanted to learn more about the underpinnings of how HIV can drive such destruction to the immune landscape and drive such high morbidity.\" This motivated him to embark on a career in scientific discovery, obtaining a Ph.D. at Tohoku University in Japan, and in the U.S. where he completed postdoctoral fellowships in HIV Immunology. \"I have been working to learn how to manipulate the immune system to limit disease and transition my knowledge towards deadly viral infections like HIV,\" says Dr. Ndhlovu. Today, as part of a $26.5-million NIH-funded HIV cure grant, Dr. Ndhlovu serves as one of the Principal Investigators of the HOPE Collaboratory. HOPE involves a collaborative partnership with Weill Cornell Medicine, Gladstone Institutes, and Scripps Research (now University of Florida), and is one of 10 groups awarded a 5-year grant from the NIH's Martin Delaney Collaboratories HIV Cure Program. Dr. Lishomwa Ndhlovu, Professor of Immunology in Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, WDOM, received his medical training in Zambia at the onset of the HIV epidemic which spurred him to pursue a Ph.D. in Immunology at the Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan. He completed postdoctoral training at the Gladstone Institutes and University of California San Francisco on an Irvington Institute Cancer Research Institute Fellowship. He also has a shared secondary appointment at the Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell Medicine. 8The HOPE Collaboratory represents a completely new strategy for curing HIV. Considered an alternative tactic, block-lock-excise, is a new strategy that targets latent HIV in new ways. This approach does so without reactivating the virus. Instead, utilizing previous knowledge regarding how other viruses have become naturally inactivated over time, the HOPE approach aims to silence and permanently remove HIV from the body. \"We have not yet been able to achieve a cure for HIV because the virus finds a way to hide out in reservoirs of cells across the body that cannot be cleared by conventional anti-HIV drugs,\" explains Dr. Ndhlovu. \"The HOPE grant is allowing us to test whether a novel block-lock-and-excise approach can achieve long-term silencing of HIV in all relevant tissue sanctuaries, so it cannot be released from cells. Coupled with permanent removal of any remnants of the silenced virus, we hope this will prevent the rebound of HIV when antiviral drugs are stopped, and lead to a cure.\" On the heels of his appointment as Principal Investigator for HOPE, Dr. Ndhlovu and colleagues published several breakthrough advances on HIV pathogenesis and persistence in PLOS Pathogens and the journal AIDS. Dr. Ndhlovu, working with colleagues and lead author Dr. Michael Corley, Assistant Professor of Immunology in Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, WDOM, utilized cell-type specific DNA methylation profiling (epigenetic markers) to investigate epigenetic changes that occur at the earliest stage of HIV infection and following immediate anti-HIV treatment. It was found that HIV rapidly embeds an epigenetic memory in immune cells, which was not mitigated by anti-HIV drugs, and even when the drugs were administered soon after diagnosis of HIV. Furthermore, their work has shown that by integrating a suite of epigenetic markers they can predict clinical outcomes including HIV reservoir dynamics. These could be key findings to improve future early interventions to reduce disease complications and to also guide HIV clinical trials for an HIV cure. \"The results from this study have been compelling in terms of generating new information on the earliest host pathogen interaction in key immune cell types during the earliest stage of acute HIV infection,\" says Dr. Ndhlovu. \"We've identified specific epigenetic hotspots associated with acute HIV infection during the very early acute HIV period and also with HIV persistence. These hotspots warrant consideration as candidates for epigenome editing approaches in HIV prevention, treatment, and cure.\" As advances continue to unfold in Dr. Ndhlovu's laboratory, his overarching goal remains: a cure for HIV. Dr. Ndhlovu's honors include the NIH's Emerging International Leaders in Global HIV/AIDS Research Award, and he is a member of the International Neuro- HIV Cure Consortium which provides cutting-edge investigation and expertise globally. He is also an elected Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology. His research has consistently earned funding from premier sources, such as the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense. Over the past 40 years, advances in treating HIV have moved it from a deadly disease to one that can be controlled with daily drugs that extend life expectancy, however, complications persist and a definitive cure has remained elusive. Dr. Ndhlovu and lab team 9The WDOM's 6th Annual Research Retreat Day attracted a record number of young investigators, trainees, and residents. Lectures were provided by WDOM faculty and keynote speaker, Dr. Drew Weissman, who played a major role in critical discoveries that allowed for the mRNA platform to be used in developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Held on October 29, 2021, the day's proceedings began at the Belfer Research Building, where opening remarks were given by Dr. Tony Hollenberg, Chair, WDOM; Dr. John P . Leonard, Executive Vice Chair, WDOM; and Dr. Steven Lipkin, Vice Chair for Research, WDOM. The event, which hosted 40 participants in person and 100 via zoom, included 10 lectures given by WDOM faculty and 80 poster presentations contributed by junior faulty, postdoctoral students, graduate students, and research technicians. Featured lecturers spanned topics in the areas of pulmonary and critical care medicine, hematology and oncology, gastroenterology, endocrinology, global health, infectious diseases, community-based medicine, and more. Following presentations from WDOM faculty, keynote speaker, Dr. Weissman, delivered an illuminating lecture on nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP therapeutics in the Weill Auditorium. The Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Dr. Weissman leads a laboratory that is focused on the study of RNA and innate immune system biology and the application of these findings to vaccine research and gene therapy. With recent publications, such as \"mRNA Vaccines for Infectious Diseases: Principles, Delivery and Clinical Translation,\" National Reviews Drug Discovery, his keynote lecture on mRNA-LNP therapeutics was ideally timed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"We were thrilled to host Dr. Weissman, who, together with Dr. Katalin Kariko, has furthered critical discoveries on the mRNA platform utilized to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2,\" said Dr. Hollenberg. WDOM's 6th Annual Research Retreat Day Hosts Leader in RNA and Vaccine Research \"It was an exciting day for all of us as we celebrated the outstanding variety of research that defines the WDOM. Since 2017, our research grant portfolio has more than doubled and, just as importantly, our department features 32 faculty members who are on career development awards from the NIH. Many others have similar awards from foundations or internal programs, such as Fund for the Future or Jumpstart. This growth will allow the department to continue to make outstanding contributions to meet unmet medical needs in everything we do.\" Research Retreat Day, which was launched by Dr. Augustine M.K. Choi, former Chair of the WDOM and now the Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean of Weill Cornell Medicine, exemplifies the wide variety of research that defines the WDOM. Attracting more and more attendees each year, the day serves as a valuable forum where senior and junior faculty can exchange ideas as they look to the future. Another key component of the day involves the WDOM's focus on developing its next generation of researchers. To that end, the day concluded with a discussion led by Dr. Hollenberg and Dr. Weissman devoted to career development objectives. The WDOM expresses its thanks to all leadership, participants, and attendees at the 6th Annual Research Retreat, as well as to Kristen Brady, Associate Director of Research Administration, WDOM, who organized the event. 10Leadership (2021) Anthony Hollenberg, M.D. Sanford I.

Greenberg Division of Cardiology is a leader in cardiovascular research, education, and clinical care. The division's mission is to remain at the forefront of scientific and technological developments that are revolutionizing cardiology and to translate these findings to the clinical bedside. Our internationally renowned programs investigate the basic mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, including the genetics of heart disease, the cellular signals and transcription factors responsible for cardiac development, the transformation and homing of stem cells for myocardial regeneration, and the delineation of the molecular bases for cardiac arrhythmias. Strategies are continually implemented to enhance physical space, expand comprehensive clinical programs, and continue our history of cutting-edge research. The division continues to develop and deliver cutting-edge therapies for heart disease and to advance clinical investigation. Expert faculty provide mentoring, training, and supervision to medical students, internal medicine residents, and fellows in cardiology, preparing them as tomorrow's leaders. The faculty also provide a host of weekly conferences for internal and external colleagues. From basic science, investigating the mechanisms of arrhythmias and large population-based studies of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, to a vast array of cardiovascular conditions and diseases, the focus is on improving patient care. This involves our faculty and all cardiology fellows-in-training, as well as postdoctoral trainees and graduate and medical students, thus creating a rich intellectual milieu in which trainees develop into experienced investigators. Clinical services achieve superior outcomes in all areas, from interventional and imaging laboratories, to outpatient consultative and ongoing care. Patient Bruce B. Lerman, M.D. Chief, Maurice R. and Corinne P . Greenberg Division of Cardiology Hilda Altschul Master Professor of Medicine Professor of Medicine Weill Cornell Medical CollegeAttending Physician NewYork-Presbyterian HospitalCardiology care covers the full spectrum of heart and vascular diseases, including, but not limited to, arrhythmias, coronary and peripheral arterial disease, valve disease, inherited heart diseases, as well as heart failure and transplantation cardiology. To facilitate immediate treatment of patients presenting in the early stages of a heart attack, there exists 24-hour, in-hospital coverage of the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, Telemetry and Step-Down Unit, and the interventional laboratory. The division is particularly proud of its Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and performance under the leadership of Dr. Shing-Chiu Wong. In the latest data published by the New York State Department of Health (2016), the Cornell Catheterization Laboratory had the lowest risk-adjusted mortality for percutaneous angioplasty for any laboratory in the state. The NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center is the only hospital in the State of New York that has a significantly lower all case mortality rate in the latest 2017 report and also over the most recent three-year period (2015-2017). 26The Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Evaluative Sciences Research draws upon the talents and experience of a multidisciplinary faculty based at Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University-Ithaca, Cornell Tech, and other institutions. Faculty members are experts in qualitative and quantitative research methodology, health services research, clinical epidemiology, medical informatics, decision sciences, health disparities research, community-based participatory research, clinimetrics, outcomes research, and behavioral science. They work together in a series of activities designed to encourage, and systematically support, the development of new research initiatives within, and outside, the division. Research efforts in the division include a strong track record with the NIH and PCORI and an ongoing commitment to fostering a new generation of investigators via training grants and other opportunities. As leaders in population health research, the division plays a unique role at Weill Cornell Medicine through its contributions to behavioral science, health disparities, and population health, and it has enrolled more than 3,000 patients in clinical research studies. The division provides Mary E. Charlson, M.D. Chief, Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Evaluative Sciences Research William T. Foley Distinguished Professor of MedicineProfessor of Medicine Weill Cornell Medical CollegeAttending Physician NewYork-Presbyterian HospitalClinical Epidemiology and Evaluative Sciences Research The faculty continued to publish papers in the top- tier journals, including findings on the mechanisms of ventricular tachycardia. Dr. Bruce Lerman, Chief, Division of Cardiology, recently published a manuscript in Circulation AE that described the body of work that resulted in identifying a novel somatic mutation in GNAS associated with right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia. The mutation results in constitutive activation of G s, impairs GTP hydrolysis, and elevates basal cAMP levels, leading to enhanced L-type calcium current and triggered activity. These findings amplify Dr. Lerman's previous work in this area and further support the novel observation that RVOT tachycardia can be caused by somatic mutations in signal transduction proteins that regulate intracellular cAMP and its downstream effectors. Dr. Jiwon Kim, The Bruce B. Lerman, M.D. Clinical Scholar and Associate Professor of Medicine, received the 2021 ASCI Council Young Physician-Scientist Award. Cardiology Fellowships n Cardiology: three-year program that prepares highly qualified candidates for careers in investigative and clinical cardiology.

With respect to diabetes, we provide state-of-the-art care for patients with type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes mellitus, offering a multidisciplinary team approach with comprehensive case management and individualized treatment for every patient. Our expert diabetes team includes physicians, nurse practitioners, certified diabetes care and education specialists, and registered nutritionists who are experienced in intensive diabetes management, including insulin pump therapy, continuous glucose monitoring systems, and state-of-the-art hybrid closed-loop systems. The division receives federal funding to support ongoing clinical and bench research in diabetes. The Comprehensive Weight Control Center (CWCC), home of obesity expertise, is directed by Dr. Louis J. Aronne, Professor of Clinical Medicine and the Sanford I. Weill Professor of Metabolic Research. Dr. Aronne and a staff of endocrinologists, nutrition, and obesity medicine specialists have developed and provide a uniquely effective form of \"weight-centric\" patient care to achieve weight loss in complex cases, which forms the clinical foundation for the field of Obesity Medicine. Led by Dr. Alpana Shukla, Director of Clinical Research at the CWCC, the research staff runs clinical trials on the management of obesity and metabolic disease with diet, medication, and novel devices, and has fostered collaborations with multiple divisions and departments at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) to develop Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism Dr. Laura Alonso Chief, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism Director, Weill Center for Metabolic Health Herbert J. and Ann L. Siegel Distinguished Professor of Medicine Professor of Medicine Weill Cornell Medical College Attending Physician NewYork-Presbyterian Hospitalnational leadership in bending the cost curve by implementing innovative and evaluative strategies for population management focused on interventions in high comorbidity patients. Related areas of investigation include studies to improve clinical outcomes, behavioral science research, research on complex patients with a significant burden of comorbidity, and comparative effectiveness. The division seeks to stimulate and support new clinical, health services, and outcomes research within and outside of Weill Department of Medicine. Divisional faculty lead graduate training programs in clinical epidemiology and research methodology. Graduates of the Master's Program in Clinical Epidemiology and Health Services Research have received more than $200 million in peer-reviewed funding. Faculty in the division continue to publish top-tier research papers focused on improving outcomes of patients with chronic illness. The PCORI cRTC, Preventing Tipping Points In High Comorbidity Patients: A Lifeline From Health Coaches (Dr. Charlson, Principal Investigator), compares the outcomes of patients randomized in clusters by FQHC within PBRNs. In this study, the research team is adding health coaches to patients' healthcare teams to help patients set life and health goals and manage their chronic conditions. They want to know how well medical teams, with a health coach, help patients manage their conditions and avoid unplanned hospital visits as compared with medical teams that do not have a health coach. The CARE T37 program, co-directed by Said Ibrahim, M.D., M.P .H., M.B.A., Mary Charlson, M.D., and Linnie Golightly, M.D., aims to identify talented URM pre-and post-doctoral trainees across the health sciences who are considering careers in health equity and global health research. Selected trainees of the program will engage in a mentored research experience tailored to their individual career and research goals.

The division has deep expertise in classical endocrine disorders, including all forms of thyroid disease (thyroid nodules and cancer; disorders of calcium metabolism, osteoporosis, and metabolic bone disease; reproductive endocrinology such as the treatment of menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, menopause, and androgen deficiency; and disorders of the pituitary and adrenal glands. Should surgery be necessary for the treatment of an endocrine disorder, we routinely collaborate with a team of experienced endocrine surgeons. In 2021, the division opened a new Clinic for Gender Affirming Care. Guided by Dr. Ann Danoff, the former director of the Division of Endocrinology at NYU, the new clinic offers gender affirming care for gender diverse adults. The team welcomes all patient referrals from physicians across all areas of medicine, providing individualized gender affirming hormone treatment. We are developing a collaborative network of relevant specialty expertise across Weill Cornell Medicine to support the whole health of our gender diverse patients. Groundbreaking research is ongoing in the division with the ultimate goal of generating new knowledge for the prevention, detection, and treatment of patients with endocrine diseases. Dr. Alonso's laboratory is focused on identifying approaches to increase the insulin-producing capacity of the pancreatic beta cells to prevent or treat diabetes. Her work is funded by the NIH and the American Diabetes Association. Drs. Anthony Hollenberg, Marcus Goncalves, Shannon Reilly, Megan Ritter, and Rohit Sharma also direct endocrine research in the Belfer Research Building. Dr. Hollenberg, a physician-scientist and endocrinologist, serves as Chair of the Weill Department of Medicine and is the recipient of the Sidney H.

She was also selected for an emerging leader (EGEN) award from the American Society of Clinical Investigation. The division congratulates two of its faculty who were recently inducted into ASCI (American Society for Clinical Investigation): Dr. Randy S. Longman and Dr. Robert E. Schwartz. Focused on interactions between gut microbes and the immune system in IBD, Dr. Longman's work has identified specific strains of bacteria that are involved and how they relay signals to the immune system to activate inflammation in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In 2021, he and colleagues, including Dr. Ellen Scherl and Dr. Chun-Jun Guo, discovered the critical finding that patients with Crohn's disease have an overabundance of an inflammation-producing gut bacteria, Escherichia coli (AIEC). Their study has uncovered a therapeutically targetable weak point in the bacteria. Dr. Schwartz is developing and building models of human liver disease in vitro . He uses stem cell biology, hepatocyte biology, and incorporates engineering techniques to better understand human liver disease with the goal to improve clinical therapy. Gastroenterology and Hepatology Fellowship Carl Crawford, M.D.Program Director A three-year program that focuses on specialized rotations and research, including opportunities to participate in clinical research (e.g., hepatology, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer screening, endoscopic ultrasound, the microbiota of the GI tract, endoscopic imaging techniques). An NIH T32 training grant provides support for two postdoctoral fellows to pursue basic or clinical research for two years. This has provided support for Master's degree training for clinical researchers and salary support and protected time for bench researchers.

In an exciting advance that was covered by many news outlets in 2021, Dr. Marshall Glesby, along with colleagues from the WDOM's Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology (Drs. Koen Van Besien, Jingmei Hsu), led a clinical trial involving a woman living with HIV who developed leukemia whom they treated with a special stem cell transplant who has since been free of HIV for more than a year. The trial involved a unique cord blood cell transplant that contained a genetic mutation that can resist HIV infection. Dr. Gulick continues to serve as co-Chair of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel. Dr. Marks continued her research as Principal Investigator on NIH Phase 3 randomized studies to evaluate the longer-term safety and efficacy of two different COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna and Novavax. Drs. David Calfee and Matthew Simon serve as the Hospital Epidemiologists for NYPH/WCM; both are noted for their strong efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as day-to-day strategies to decrease hospital-acquired infections at NYPH/ WCM. The Center for Special Studies (CSS; Directors Drs. Jon Jacobs and Samuel Merrick), the HIV primary care service, continues to provide care for over 2,500 HIV-infected patients and recommends HIV prevention strategies for at-risk HIV-negative individuals. At NYP/Lower Manhattan Hospital, the inpatient and outpatient infectious diseases service and hospital epidemiology-infection control are led by Dr. Harjot Singh. At NYP/Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, the Division of Infectious Diseases is led by Dr. Harold Horowitz and at NYP/Queens by Dr. Sorana Segal-Maurer. In 2021, new faculty recruits included Drs.

Infectious Diseases Fellowship Matthew Simon, M.D., Program Director A two- to three-year training program that includes individualized training through clinical rotations, didactic course work, mentored research, and faculty guidance to develop the next generation of infectious diseases physician-scientists and academic clinicians.Center for Global Health The Center for Global Health's mission is to decrease health care inequalities and improve the health of people in lower-income countries through clinical care, research, and training. The center has 18 core faculty members, five postdoctoral fellows, and more than 50 collaborating faculty members from multiple WDOM divisions, including Cardiology, Clinical Epidemiology, General Internal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, and Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. The center has long-standing programs in Brazil, Haiti, India, Tanzania, and Uganda. Research and training programs in cardiovascular disease, women's health, and infectious diseases are supported by the United States' National Institutes of Health (NIH), foundations, and individual donors. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is now the leading cause of death in lower-income countries worldwide and Weill Cornell Medicine's (WCM) CVD research and training in Haiti and Tanzania expanded significantly in 2021 to address this challenge. Dr. Molly McNairy, Associate Professor, WDOM, leads a 3,000-person community-based cohort study of CVD and risk factors in Haiti supported by the NIH. This is one of the first and largest community-based cohort studies on CVD in a low-income country and will define risk factors for CVD with the goal of defining targets for prevention interventions. This research is being done in collaboration with WCM's partner, the GHESKIO Centers in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, which is led by WCM faculty member, Dr. Jean Pape. In 2021, Drs. McNairy and Pape also received an NIH training grant from the Fogarty International Center to train young Haitian investigators in CVD prevention, care, and research methodology. In Tanzania, WDOM faculty members Drs. Robert Peck and Jennifer Downs received an NIH R01 43The Division of Medical Ethics pursues a tripartite mission of medical education, ethics consultation, scholarship and research. In response to the ethical challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the division has been active providing ethics consultations to patients, families, and clinical staff at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center (NYP/WCMC) and NewYork-Presbyterian/Lower Manhattan Hospital (NYP/LMH), as well as additional counsel to our colleagues at NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital and NewYork-Presbyterian Queens Hospital. The division's case consult volume makes it one of the most active ethics consultation services in the U.S. The Ethics Committee of NYP/WCMC is chaired by Dr. Joseph J. Fins, Division Chief, provides oversight to the consultative process and guidance to the hospital on policies and procedures related to medical ethics and patient rights. Barrie Huberman, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, serves as Director of Clinical Ethics and provides consultative services, along with Dr. Fins, Joan Walker, R.N., and Dr. Ezra Gabbay, who also serves as Chair of NYP/LMH's Ethics Committee, as well as Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine in Medical Ethics, Debjani Mukherjee, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and clinical ethicist with deep expertise in disability ethics. The consult service is also enriched by the presence of Dr. Nekee Pandya and Dr. Laura Kolbe as well as current Clinical Ethics Fellows, Benjamin Sundholm, J.D., Ryan Dougherty, Ph.D., M.S.W., and Dr. Colleen Farrell. The division plays a key role in advancing the educational mission of Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Inmaculada de Melo-Martin led the ethics curriculum on professionalism. Dr. Huberman led Advanced Clinical Ethics, and Dr. Mukherjee directed Health, Illness and Disease. Ethics content has recently been added to the transition for the residency course given to medical students. The division also considers ethical and regulatory issues in clinical research, so that students appreciate their responsibilities as clinicians and investigators. Medical Ethics to conduct a cluster randomized trial to improve blood pressure control in rural villages. This research is being conducted in collaboration with Weill Bugando School of Medicine in Mwanza Tanzania and will examine the impact of engaging religious leaders in community-based blood pressure control programs. The Center's women's health research and training expanded in 2021. Dr. Jyoti Mathad conducts clinical research on maternal health in Pune India. In 2021, she reported in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases the results of an NIH-supported clinical trial on a new regimen to treat latent tuberculosis (TB) in pregnant women. Pregnant women have historically been excluded from clinical trials of new drugs, and Dr. Mathad's research provides critical information to clinicians caring for pregnant women at risk for TB in lower income countries. Dr. Puja Chebrolu, who is mentored by Dr. Mathad, received a Department of Medicine Fund for the Future Award for her studies on gestational diabetes in pregnant women in India. The Center's Women in Global Health Research Initiative promotes women's leadership in global health and is supported by the WCM Board of Fellows Chair, Jessica Bibliowicz. In 2021, the women's initiative held their annual symposium in Tanzania in collaboration with the Weill Bugando School of Medicine. Ninety-five women health professionals attended the symposium from six countries and multiple other international institutions, including the Tanzanian Ministry of Health, Muhimbili University of Dar es Salaam, the Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology, Nairobi University, and the Women in Law, and Development Africa (a pan-African women's rights group). The symposium included keynote presentations on gender and leadership, leveraging digital media to promote women's health, and working groups to develop practical next steps to advance women in global health leadership in Africa. Infectious Diseases continue to be a focus of the Center's research, especially TB which causes over 1 million deaths worldwide each year. In 2021, Dr. Daniel Fitzgerald, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Center for Global Health, received a 6.1 million dollar ten-year research grant for participation in the Tuberculosis Trials Consortium of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These trials will focus on developing shorter and more effective treatments for TB with studies conducted at the GHESKIO Centers in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

On the international front, the division has continued a synergistic collaboration with colleagues and students in Doha, via Dr. Pablo Rodriguez del Pozo, Associate Professor of Medical Ethics in Medicine, who leads the ethics curriculum at that campus. Dr. del Pozo explores cross-cultural issues and medical education. He has completed a project funded by the Qatar National Research Foundation exploring the rights of persons with disabilities aimed to inform the Qatari legal system. This multinational project involves the Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar, Qatar University, Institute of Human Rights at Carlos III University in Madrid, and the Division of Medical Ethics, WDOM, with Dr. Fins collaborating. The project will culminate with an important monograph that will have practical and theoretical impact on disability studies. Dr. Fins continues his collaboration with Dr. Nicholas D. Schiff, Jerold B. Katz Professor of Neurology and Neuroscience, as they co-direct the Consortium for the Advanced Study of Brain Injury (C.A.S.B.I.) at Weill Cornell Medicine and Rockefeller University. CASBI's goal is to elucidate mechanisms of recovery, develop novel therapeutics, and advance public policy to meet the needs of these patients and families. Dr. Schiff is Principal Investigator on an NIH Brain Initiative grant on the use of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in severe brain injury. Dr. Fins is a co-investigator on the project. Following upon his book, Rights Come to Mind: Brain Injury, Ethics and the Struggle for Consciousness (Cambridge University Press), Dr. Fins has pioneered ethical and legal scholarship advancing the civil and disability rights of patients with severe brain injury. Dr. Fins has an RO1 from the NIH BRAIN Initiative, \"Cognitive Restoration: Neuroethics and Disability Rights,\" to further elucidate these issues in the context of the aforementioned first in human DBS trial in moderate to severe brain injury. Dr. Fins has expanded the reach of CASBI at Yale Law School, where he was appointed as a Visiting Professor of Law in addition to his position as the Solomon Center Distinguished Scholar in Medicine, Bioethics and the Law. His work at the interface of neuroscience, neuroethics and disability law has resulted in collaborative scholarship with Yale Law School students and faculty and numerous publications in leading law reviews. Dr. Fins is assisted in these efforts by Zachary Shapiro, M.A., J.D., who serves as an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Medical Ethics Research in Medicine. With the support of the Weill Cornell Clinical Translational Center, Drs. Fins, Mukherjee and colleagues are leading a study examining \"Assistive Technology in Pediatric Brain Injury following In-patient Rehabilitation: Access, Barriers and Burdens on Patients and Families\" in conjunction with the Blythedale Children's Hospital.

Gulick 45The Division of Nephrology and Hypertension is committed to a tripartite mission of patient care, research, and education. A combination of resources has ensured the division's success, including NIH funding over three decades, a clinical immunogenetics laboratory, a self-supported hypertension clinical practice, and support from Weill Cornell Medicine, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, and philanthropy. The division's clinical excellence is the product of making patient care the highest priority, while effectively translating bench discoveries to the bedside and applying evidence from clinical trials into compassionate clinical practice. We provide compassionate, comprehensive, state-of-the- art care to each patient afflicted with kidney disease and/or high blood pressure. We have self-organizing teams for each critical area of nephrology: transplantation medicine, dialysis, apheresis, hypertension, clinical nephrology (e.g., diabetes and metabolic renal disease), onconephrology (kidney disease in patients with malignancy), critical care nephrology, acute kidney injury and cardio-renal syndromes, nephropathology and obstetrics nephrology. Services include kidney consultations, inpatient kidney medicine, dialysis therapy, and kidney and pancreas transplantation and kidney care for liver-kidney recipients and kidney dysfunction in stem cell transplant recipients. Our self-organizing teams of kidney specialty rose to the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our fellows and faculty ensured that every COVID-19 patient received state-of-the-art kidney care. The team contributed new knowledge in areas ranging from acute kidney injury and innovative dialysis therapy to safe kidney transplantation and personalized care of kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with COPVID-19 resulting in excellent outcomes. Our nephrologists work collaboratively with nephrologists with primary employment at The Rogosin Institute, nephrologists with primary employment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and with the Weill Cornell Medicine kidney transplant surgeons in the Division of Transplantation Surgery to manage our transplant recipients with highly personalized therapies to protect the transplanted organ while helping to reduce the toxic side effects of anti-rejection drugs. Our transplant physician-scientists have made pioneering discoveries on mechanisms of action of anti-rejection drugs and have invented noninvasive molecular tests to personalize immunosuppressive drug therapy of transplant patients. The kidney disease program has been consistently rated in the top 10 by US News & World Report (Ranked 2nd in the country and 1 st in New York in 2020-2021). It is one of the highest-ranked programs among the medical subspecialties at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. The kidney transplantation program at Weill Cornell Medicine is a significant contributor to NYP's transplantation program (ranked #1 in the U.S. for the last 10 years), and its translational research has been transforming care for transplant recipients. More than 200 kidney transplants are performed annually at our center with excellent patient and graft survival rates. The most recent adult (18+) one-year patient and graft survival rates, following living donor kidney transplantation, were 98.84% and 97.85%, respectively. The one-year patient and graft survival rates following deceased donor kidney transplantation were 95.57% and 93.14%, respectively. These exemplary outcomes are all the more impressive in light of the center transplanting high- risk patients. (Data Source: Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, Health Resources and Service Administration). The first kidney transplant in the New York tri-state region was performed at our center in October 1963; more than 6,000 kidney transplants have been performed since the center's inception. Several innovations in transplantation have been introduced by our transplant physicians, including: blood type (ABO) incompatible kidney transplants; kidney transplantation across a positive cross-match; minimizing the amount of drugs patients need for successful transplantation; treatment protocols to reduce serious post-transplant complications (e.g., infection and malignancy); and noninvasive molecular assays for assessing transplant status and reducing the need for an invasive biopsy procedure. The division's Hypertension Center is one-of-a-kind in the U.S. and has discovered and implemented clinical therapies that are personalized for the individual patient. The hypertension faculty pursue innovative research (e.g., studies of pregnancy-induced hypertension, mind-body link in hypertension, personalized drug therapy for hypertension control). Internationally acclaimed, the Hypertension Consultative practice continues to thrive under the direction Manikkam Suthanthiran, M.D. Chief, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension Chief, Department of Transplantation Medicine and Extracorporeal Therapy Stanton Griffis Distinguished Professor of Medicine Professor of Medicine Professor of Biochemistry Professor of Medicine in Surgery Weill Cornell Medical College Attending Physician NewYork-Presbyterian HospitalNephrology and Hypertension 46of Dr. Phyllis August, Ralph A. Baer Professor of Medical Research, and with complementary expertise provided by Dr. Mark S. Pecker, Professor of Clinical Medicine, Dr. Samuel J. Mann, Professor of Clinical Medicine, Dr. Line Malha, Assistant Professor of Medicine, and Rosemerie Marion, ANP , Nurse Practitioner. The division continues to drive breakthrough research. Division Chief, Dr. Suthanthiran, directs a highly productive, NIH-funded world-renowned research Laboratory of Immunogenetics and Transplantation. The division has pioneered the development of gene expression profiling for the noninvasive diagnosis and prognostication of acute rejection in renal allografts and has contributed to several landmark studies in organ transplantation on elucidation of the genetic signature of rejection and tolerance. Dr. Suthanthiran's translational research has been NIH-funded continuously for 30-plus years, and he is a recipient of the prestigious NIH MERIT award. Dr. Phyllis August serves as the Site Principal Investigator (PI) on a cooperative grant from the NHLBI/NIH/DHHS to evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacologic treatment of mild chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Dr. Mary Choi is the recipient of multiple awards from NIH to study novel mechanisms of organ fibrosis and autophagy. Dr. Thangamani Muthukumar, in a productive collaboration with Dr. Franco Mueller, has deciphered innate immune mechanisms responsible for kidney allograft rejection. Dr. Darshana M. Dadhania is a PI on an NIDDK cooperative grant to study the impact of the APOL1 gene on long-term outcomes in renal transplant recipients of a kidney from an African American donor and the impact on kidney function in African-Americans donating a kidney, and an R01 award to establish the utility of urinary cell-free DNA to detect a wide range of pathogens as well as gain insights into antibiotic resistance and host-pathogen interactions. Dr. John Lee is a recipient of an NIAID grant to invent and apply shotgun sequencing of urinary cell-free DNA to define the microbial, bacterial growth dynamics, tissue injury in the transplanted kidney, and the host's response to urinary tract infection (UTI). In another NIAID-funded grant, he is investigating many avenues related to the impact of gut microbiome on human health and disease. Dr. Thalia Salinas is the recipient of the prestigious CTSC KL2 Career Development Award. Dr. Suthanthiran recently executed a research collaboration agreement with CareDx, a leader in transplantation molecular diagnosis, to further develop biomolecular markers of kidney allograft status. Dr. Mary Choi, Professor of Medicine and a world- renowned physician-scientist, is conducting research addressing the mechanisms of kidney injury and failure. Dr. Choi's fundamental studies should not only yield key insights into mechanisms underpinning kidney injury but will also help to identify novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of progression of kidney injury manifested by fibrosis. The multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B) is considered a major player in kidney disease and health, and Dr. Choi's seminal studies have led to the cloning and characterization of the cell surface receptors for TGF-B1; delineation of key intracellular mediators of glomerular endothelial cell 47proliferation and differentiation. Her original contributions have resulted in an improved understanding of the molecular mechanism of tissue injury, inflammation, and fibrosis as they pertain to the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease. Her laboratory has successfully resolved mechanisms by which TGF-B1 elicits key cytoprotectants, such as heme oxygenase-1, and carbon monoxide and protection from oxidative stress and kidney injury via activation of autophagy. Dr. Choi and colleagues recently identified a new therapeutic target by their discovery that a receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 independently promotes kidney fibrosis. Dr. Choi's research has been supported continuously by highly competitive NIH awards and she is a PI Investigator, co-PI, and co-Investigator on multiple NIH grants. Dr. Darshana M. Dadhania, Medical Director, Kidney and Pancreas Transplant Program, NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, ensures the operation and compliance of the transplant program in accordance with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Bylaws in collaboration with the Kidney and Pancreas Transplantation Division within the Department of Surgery at Weill Cornell Medicine. As part of an intercampus team of researchers working on a $3.65 million NIH grant, Dr. Dadhania and Dr. John R. Lee, along with colleagues, are developing a method for diagnosing urinary tract infection by innovative profiling cell-free DNA. A cohort of 300 kidney transplant patients will be profiled using state-of-the-art technologies the investigators had previously developed. Dr. Deirdre Sawinski joined the division in 2021 from University of Pennsylvania as an Associate Professor of Medicine. Dr. Sawinski is a clinical researcher and epidemiologist focused principally on virally mediated disease following kidney transplantation. She has contributed impactful studies on donor selection, transplant complications and immunosuppression management relevant to the clinical transplant community. She is focused on the evaluation and management of kidney transplant candidates and recipients, participates in the education of fellows, residents and medical students and conducts research on improving transplant outcomes. 2021 was a banner year for honors, speakerships, and publications. Dr. Dadhania moderated and spoke at the Society of Transplantation and International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation joint symposium on \"Challenges in Heart/Kidney Transplantation.\" Her presentation was on sensitization and the role of HLA and non-HLA antibodies in simultaneous Heart-Kidney Transplantation. Dr. John R. Lee received the 2021 ASCI Council's Young Physician-Scientist Award, which recognizes physician-scientists who are early in their first faculty appointment and have made notable achievements in their research. Dr. August co-authored a landmark paper in the New England Journal of Medicine detailing treatment for mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy (Tito et. Al., 2022). Dr. Sawinski was awarded the Ritu Banga Diversity and Healthcare Disparities Research Award. Nephrology faculty teach the Health, Illness, and Disease (HID) Course for Weill Cornell medical students at both the New York and Qatar campuses.

The division remains active with collaborators at Columbia and NYU in an ALA-ACRC series of joint projects. The Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) Program, led by Dr. Robert Kaner, is one of the premier programs in the country focusing on a complex series of disorders characterized by lung inflammation and fibrosis. It is a designated Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation (PFF) Center of Excellence. In close collaboration with the Departments of Radiology, Pathology, and Thoracic Surgery at WCM, the rheumatology division at the Hospital for Special Surgery, and the pathology department at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the program holds weekly multidisciplinary conferences to optimize patient care. Divisional investigators lead and participate in multicenter clinical trials of new therapies bringing state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment options for patients with ILD. The Pulmonary Procedure Service, directed by Dr. BenGary Harvey, provides innovative diagnostic and therapeutic services for the diagnosis and management of lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, and lung infection. Dr. Harvey, who has received advanced training in the bronchoscopic management of advanced emphysema, also directs Endoscopic Valve Lung Volume Reduction. The procedure utilizes the insertion of small valves through a bronchoscope. Once the valves reach the most diseased areas of the lung, Dr. Harvey occludes (or closes) the non-functional portions of the lung creating room for the healthier parts of the lung to improve breathing function and quality of life. Dr. Margaret Goldberg has recently joined the division to expand procedural expertise to the complex patient care environment of the ICU. The Pulmonary Function Laboratory, led by Dr. Abraham Sanders, remains a vital component of the division's continuum of care via expert and timely diagnostic services. Led by Medical Director, Dr. Ana Krieger, and collaborators, the Weill Cornell Center for Sleep Medicine (run jointly by the Weill Department of Medicine's Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and the Department of Neurology) is accredited by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the largest academic research program in the Tri-State area. It provides evaluation and treatment for the full range of pulmonary and non-pulmonary sleep problems, employing multidisciplinary specialists in partnership with NewYork- Presbyterian Hospital, and carrying out cutting-edge federally-funded research projects, including a recently funded R01 for a collaborative research study of sleep in people with HIV in Tanzania (PI, Robert Peck). For NYP/LMH, Dr. David Weir serves as Director of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. His expertise includes treatment and symptom management for advanced lung disease and compassionate care for the critically ill. Dr. Seth Manoach serves as Director of the MICU. An expert in the pathophysiology of critical illness, including cardiopulmonary interface and advanced airway management, he is dedicated to improving patient care in the MICU. Fernando J. Martinez, M.D. Chief, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Bruce Webster Professor of Internal Medicine Professor of Clinical Medicine Weill Cornell Medical CollegeAttending Physician NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine 50Dr. Kelly Griffin has led numerous initiatives to enhance nocturnal ICU care across our campus, while spearheading a close interaction with maternal fetal medicine and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology to standardize the care of critically ill obstetrics patients. She participates in regional and national programs focusing on optimizing health systems under stress, especially important in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Led by Dr. Lindsey Lief, Director, Medical Intensive Care Unit, the division has expanded an outpatient program focr post-ICU recovery (housed within Weill Cornell Medicine Pulmonary Associates at 425 East 61 Street). Experts in intensive care see patients in follow-up after an ICU admission, either from NYP/Weill Cornell or other institutions. ICU survivors are at risk for post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) that can have effects on mental and physical health, cognitive function, and the ability to care for oneself and go back to work. This practice provides ICU survivors with everything they need to maximize recovery. This program has served as a key nidus for expanded post-COVID-19 care and its associated long-term manifestations. The post-COVID team draws on expertise in rehabilitation, cardiology, nutrition, psychiatry, radiology, and integrative medicine. Dr. Joseph Mailman is Pulmonary Director for Veno- Venous ECMO at the Cornell campus and affiliated regional sites (24/7 coverage schedule of care for VV-ECMO patients). In collaboration with CT-Surgery and Critical Care Anesthesiology, Dr. Mailman has built a team of pulmonary and critical care physicians who are available for 24/7 VV-ECMO consultation and management of the most severely ill patients in the hospitals. An interdisciplinary consult service is available to sister sites (LMH, NYP-Q, NYP-BM) and other local hospitals. In combination with the Shock program, Weill Cornell was recently awarded ELSO GOLD status for Excellence in Extracorporeal Life Support. Dr. Mailman also led the division's transition to EPIC systems, training nearly 150 critical care physicians to use the new EMR system (virtual). Dr. Mailman also serves as Director of the Pulmonary Embolism Response Team. Dr. Clark Owyang utilizes his multidisciplinary critical care training to pursue interests in critical care delivery, resuscitative TEE, critical care echocardiography and provision of ECMO.

Dr. Dana Zappetti, the WDOM's Vice Chair for Clinical Operations, continues to advance ambulatory programs across the WDOM ensuring the best use of space and resources. Investigative programs The division's research portfolio ranges from interstitial and obstructive lung diseases, pneumonia, and lung cancer, to sleep medicine and genetic medicine. Physician-scientists participate in clinical and basic mechanistic investigations, both independently and with collaborators. A key participant in numerous NHLBI-sponsored COPD studies, Dr. Martinez, Division Chief, defined the role of lung volume reduction surgery, chronic macrolide therapy, statin 51therapy, and long-term oxygen therapy in COPD. He has also been involved in defining the immunological basis of acute exacerbations, the role of innovative small airways imaging methods, and the role of COPD endotypes. He is Principal Investigator (PI) on a nearly $11 million R01 grant (The Capture Study) from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) that seeks to identify COPD patients who are under-recognized and undertreated in 100 primary care centers across seven practice-based research networks across the U.S. Dr. Martinez has also been awarded an $11 million five-year grant from the NHLBI, \"Understanding the Origins of Early COPD.\" A new cohort of younger at-risk individuals will be recruited to link chest imaging and pathologic abnormality with longitudinal disease progression; findings will be used to target the development of disease-modifying therapies. Similarly, with NHLBI support, Dr. Martinez has defined optimal approaches to diagnosing idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, imaging and biochemical approaches to prognostication, and he has investigated the role of various therapeutic approaches for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). He has also studied the interaction between dysbiosis in the lung microbial community and disease progression, which led to an ongoing NHLBI-funded study of an innovative therapeutic approach targeting IPF progression. Dr. Martinez remains an overall PI of PRECISIONS, which aims to transform the diagnosis and treatment of IPF by moving into a new era of precision medicine ($22 million grant from the NIH and Three Lakes Partners). Dr. Augustine M.K. Choi, Dean, WCM, directs an extremely active laboratory that, in part, leads the global investigative carbon monoxide (CO) community in understanding this complex biological pathway. His laboratory has successfully translated these findings as they lead the design and successful completion of Phase I and Phase II trials targeting the use of inhaled CO in human disease. Dr. Choi is the leading investigator in a multicenter, investigational program delineating the biological pathways intersecting between COPD and IPF.

Additional training is available through master's degree programs and additional research time is available through our T-32 Training Grant. Key investigative areas include cellular biology and molecular immunology, lung and vascular injury, human pathophysiology, and epidemiology and bioinformatics. Faculty mentoring across the tri-institutional setting provides an ideal training environment and promotes scientific collaboration. Fellows typically go on to academic faculty appointments. 53The Division of Regenerative Medicine is dedicated to furthering discoveries and knowledge on organ regeneration and repair, and to translating their potential into life-saving therapeutics. It is led by renowned physician-scientist Dr. Shahin Rafii, who was recently elected to the esteemed Association of American Physicians (AAP). Dr. Rafii has been at the forefront of vascular biology and stem cell research for nearly two decades, the division is an interactive community of researchers and clinicians who work at Weill Cornell Medicine in stem cell research and regenerative medicine. Research in this division is not only of great value in terms of patient care, it is serving to educate the next generation of scientists and clinicians, as well as the general public, about the realities and potential benefit of stem cell research. A role model in creating synergistic partnerships with other institutions and foundations, the division also advocates for public policy that promotes stem cell based research and therapies. Known for its state-of-the-art approach to investigation, the division's laboratory has been carrying out cutting-edge studies on stem cells and organ regeneration since 2003. Dr. Rafii, who also serves as the Director of the Ansary Stem Cell Institute at Weill Cornell Medicine, provides a core laboratory that is utilized by junior faculty members, principle investigators, postdoctoral fellows, graduate resident students, and support staff. The laboratory also trains visiting scientists from around the world. Additionally, the division deploys staff to the Starr Foundation Tri-Institutional Stem Cell Derivation Laboratory at Weill Cornell Medicine to offer on-site human embryonic stem cells and a GLP facility that serves researchers working with pluripotent stem cells. The Ansary Stem Cell Institute is home to landmark advances in regenerative medicine. Dr. Rafii, its Director, is nationally and internationally recognized for having pioneered the transformative paradigm demonstrating that tissue-specific adult endothelial cells (ECs) are unique instructive vascular niche cells that produce paracrine \"angiocrine factors\" to directly induce organ regeneration. This concept has revealed the remarkable heterogeneity of the adult vasculature that is underscored by production of tissue-specific angiocrine factors necessary for orchestrating organ regeneration. Dr. Rafii's laboratory has ushered in a new era in state-of-the-art models for the study of tissue-specific induction of angiocrine factors in ECs. His laboratory's many advances include the identification of physiologically relevant tissue-specific stimulatory and anti-fibrotic angiocrine factors. The team utilizes in vivo genetic models to determine the role of angiocrine factors in organ regeneration and has played a major role in illuminating the intrinsic and microenvironmental determinants of vascular heterogeneity. The division also focuses on stem cell biology and their niches using mouse and human genetic models, tissue culture approaches, and molecular biology to model the complex interactions between stem cells and their micro-environment. Multiomics, molecular and cell biological techniques are combined to achieve a systems-level understanding of these complex processes. Recently, Dr. Rafii was named as Director of The Hartman Institute for Therapeutic Organ Regeneration, which will expand the frontiers of stem cell-based research and organoid development, creating a hub within Weill Cornell Medicine's Division of Regenerative Medicine that will facilitate collaboration among researchers, clinicians, surgeons and entrepreneurs. Scientists in the division have already devised game-changing technologies to fully realize the promise of tissue-specific organoids for repairing injured and malfunctioning organs. The Institute is focused on a multidisciplinary approach in advancing organ regeneration and repair with the goal of translating discoveries to patient care at Weill Cornell Medicine. This institute was made possible through a gift made by Board of Fellows member Alan Hartman and his wife, Kim. Currently, Dr. Rafii is focused on identifying the molecular and cellular pathways involved in organ regeneration and tumor growth. He has established the concept that vascular endothelial cells are not just inert plumbing to deliver oxygen and nutrients, but also by production of tissue-specific growth factors, defined as angiocrine factors, support organ regeneration and tumor proliferation. He has shown that bone marrow endothelial cells by elaboration of angiocrine factors, such as Notch ligands, support stem cell self-renewal and differentiation into lymphoid and myeloid progenitors. He has recently shown that liver and lung endothelial cells are endowed with unique phenotypic and functional Shahin Rafii, M.D. Chief, Division of Regenerative Arthur B. Belfer Professor in Genetic Medicine Director, Ansary Stem Cell Institute Professor of Medicine Professor of Genetics Professor of Reproductive MedicineRegenerative Medicine 54attributes, and by production of unique instructive growth factors, contribute to the hepatic and alveolar regeneration. Dr. Rafii has also induced differentiation of the murine and human pluripotent embryonic stem cells into functional and engraftable vascular and hematopoietic derivatives. He developed screening approaches to exploit endothelial cells, as a vascular niche platform, to identify, as yet, unrecognized novel angiocrine factors that instruct organ morphogenesis and also orchestrate stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. The laboratory of Dr. Joe Qiao Zhou has made seminal contributions to regenerative biology. His laboratory pioneered a new approach of regenerating pancreatic insulin-secreting beta cells in mature pancreas by directly reprogramming pancreatic acinar cells with defined genetic factors. This study is the first proof-of-concept that cells in adult organs can be reprogrammed in vivo, which led to numerous subsequent studies of adult tissue plasticity. His laboratory discovered that gastric antral cells are also highly amenable for conversion into insulin-secreting cells. The Zhou lab continues to make significant progress in advancing mechanistic studies, as well as in developing technologies to produce insulin + cells from human gastric stem cells as a potential cell therapy for type 1 diabetes. Also in process is the study of stem cells in large intestine mucosal regeneration. The Zhou lab has identified critical factors, without which, colon mucosa is transformed into small intestine mucosa with implications in diseases such as short-bowel disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, and colorectal cancer. The Zhou lab uses state-of-the- art tools and approaches, including human embryonic stem cells, human organoids, CRISPR screening, single-cell sequencing, functional genomics, and many more for mechanistic understanding and therapeutic development. In 2021, Dr. Zhou and colleagues published key findings in Cell Stem Cell on the role the gene SATB2 plays in the colon lining, which has opened a window on illuminating the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as well as insights into a rare syndrome in which the SATB2 gene is disrupted. It was discovered that SATB2 contributes to changes in stem cells that typically develop into the inner lining of the colon, or large intestine, and furthermore, that these changes in stem cells transform them into a type of cell that normally would line a portion of the small intestine called the ileum. The researchers also found that the presence of the SATB2 gene enables other intestinal cell types to develop and retain colon cell-like properties. Dr. Raphael Lis aims to advance the study of the brain blood barrier (BBB) by developing in vitro models attempting to mimic the physiological complexity of the BBB in vivo. It has been demonstrated that BBB traits are not intrinsic to brain specific endothelial cells (ECs), but rather the result of a dynamic interplay with their microenvironment, including multiple cell types such as astrocytes and pericytes. The Lis laboratory aims to resolve this issue by developing various in vitro BBB models using neural cell co-cultures consisting of ECs, pericytes, and astrocytes. These models also include pluripotent stem cell differentiation methods, as well as brain organoids and organ-on-a-chip approaches to generate an in vitro model of the BBB for clinical research and drug development. Dr. David Redmond is a computational biologist specializing in high-throughput sequencing platforms, including bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, epigenetics, and spatial technologies. With the recent development of these single-cell and spatial sequencing technologies that have allowed for a deeper understanding of the cell as a functional unit, Dr. Redmond has been developing methods for deconvoluting important functional data including one of the first algorithms for recapitulating full TCR identity in single cell data. 55Based at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), the Division of Rheumatology is a national and international leader in clinical care of patients with autoimmune, inflammatory and musculoskeletal conditions; in research that has contributed to identification of novel therapeutic targets and new understanding of disease mechanisms; and in innovative approaches to medical education and education research. In addition to close to 20,000 in-person or telehealth outpatient rheumatology visits per year, the division has responsibility for the pre- and post-surgical medical care of more than 10,000 patients per year who undergo orthopaedic procedures at HSS. The large volume of patients treated at HSS has enabled HSS clinicians and researchers to develop patient registries with detailed clinical information that provide important resources for clinical and translational research studies. Longitudinal data collection, patient reported outcomes and availability of biologic samples are features of some of the registries shared with collaborators nationally and internationally. Achieving optimal outcomes for patients is the goal of our 41 active rheumatologists, who treat disorders ranging from osteoarthritis to the most complex patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), lupus, vasculitis, systemic sclerosis or diagnostic dilemmas. In addition to outpatient clinics in the Main HSS Hospital and HSS Brooklyn, rheumatology patients are seen at satellites in Paramus, NJ, and White Plains, NY , with a site in Uniondale on Long Island opening in the summer of 2022. The HSS Department of Medicine (DOM) Clinical Operations Work Group, co-chaired by Drs. Linda Russell and Jessica Gordon, is implementing the transformation of the division's clinical practice operations with the goal of establishing more efficient and value-focused care across all practices. Dr. Steven Magid serves as Chief Medical Information Officer for HSS, overseeing implementation of the medical information technology system in the hospital and office practices. Optimal preparation and postoperative management of patients undergoing orthopedic surgery at HSS is under the leadership of Dr. Russell, Director, Division of Perioperative Medicine. Dr. Karen Onel leads the Division of Pediatric Rheumatology, with many clinical and academic programs shared with the adult rheumatologists. The Division of Endocrinology, which focuses on bone health, is led by Dr. Richard Bockman. Dr. Andy Miller is the Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases, which collaborates with orthopaedic surgeons to care for patients with musculoskeletal infections in the hospital setting and rheumatologists to care for immunocompromised patients. Rheumatology clinics at HSS represent an essential training component of our rheumatology fellowship programs, as does a busy inpatient consult service that covers HSS, NYP Hospital, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. HSS rheumatology fellowship programs in adult and pediatric rheumatology combine a broad-based, in depth clinical and research experience to deliver the highest quality academic training to rheumatology professionals. The adult rheumatology training program is directed by Drs. Juliet Aizer and Karmela (Kimi) Chan, and the pediatric rheumatology training program is directed by Dr. Alexa Adams. Fifteen adult and pediatric rheumatology fellows provide continuity of care for the patients seen in the clinics with involvement of all rheumatology faculty members as supervisors and teachers. A weekly clinic for evaluation of new patients, and specialty clinics focused on inflammatory arthritis, lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome, vasculitis and systemic sclerosis, provide rheumatology fellows and rotating internal medicine residents with a superb experience in evaluation and management of a full spectrum of rheumatic diseases. A rich learning environment is also provided in the multidisciplinary clinic conferences, following Monday Inflammatory Arthritis Clinic and Friday Lupus Clinic, which involves discussion of patient management guided by recent literature and enriched by attendance of representatives from other Weill Cornell specialties. Training of fellows in musculoskeletal ultrasound is provided through a specialized curriculum as well as hands-on experience. Each rheumatology trainee completes a basic, clinical, or education research project under the supervision of one or more faculty members and with oversight by a mentoring committee. S.

Clinical rheumatologists, clinical and laboratory investigators, nurses, social workers, and students advance disease-focused research, patient education, and professional education through the division's centers of excellence in lupus, scleroderma/vasculitis/myositis, inflammatory arthritis, and integrative rheumatology and orthopedics, as well as its Barbara Volcker Center for Women and Rheumatic Diseases. Timothy B. Niewold, M.D. was recently appointed as Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Medicine at HSS. A pioneering physician-scientist in lupus, Dr. Niewold is working with Dr. Bridges in leading the next generation of impactful translational and clinical research and will chair the Research Work Group. Dr. Lionel B. Ivashkiv, Chief Scientific Officer, is supported by NIH research grants addressing epigenetic mechanisms relevant to regulation of inflammation and bone resorption in rheumatoid arthritis. His lab is making seminal observations on the epigenetic control of cytokine gene expression and osteoclast maturation, and his studies of chromatin modifications are leading to new understanding of how the immune system becomes primed to react efficiently to future microbial or inflammatory stimuli. Dr. Jane Salmon, Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs, Weill Cornell Medicine, has identified biomarkers that predict adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with lupus or antiphospholipid syndrome. She is leading an interventional trial of a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. Dr. Mary Crow's lab, in collaboration with Dr. Kyriakos A. Kirou, has demonstrated that type I interferon is a central mediator of immune dysregulation and autoimmunity in SLE and has provided insight into the role of additional molecular pathways involved in lupus nephritis. In addition to established investigators, the Division of Rheumatology has a deep pool of outstanding early-stage investigators, including Drs. Bella Mehta, Medha Barbhaiya, Kim Lakin, David Fernandez, Sarah Lieber, Theresa Wampler Muskardin, Ashira Blazer, and Ruth Fernandez Ruiz. Collectively, this group has funding from the NIH (K23, K08), Rheumatology Research Foundation, Arthritis National Research Foundation, and Lupus Research Alliance. Their research interests are broad and include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, scleroderma, undifferentiated connective tissue disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, myositis, frailty in rheumatic diseases, the impact of COVID-19 on patients with rheumatic diseases, and health care disparities. Drs. Laura Donlin, Vivian Bykerk, Lou Bridges, and Susan Goodman of HSS, along with Dr. Dana Orange at Rockefeller University and investigators at Rochester University and the University of Colorado, lead a national NIH-funded Accelerating Medicines Partnership Program Autoimmune and Immune-Mediated Diseases (AMP AIM) team focused on rheumatoid arthritis. The AMP AIM Program will utilize a suite of next-generation tools and technologies to map how cell types, cell states, and cell-to-cell interactions network to cause inflammation, abnormal function, and tissue injury, not only in RA, but in psoriatic spectrum diseases, Sj\u00f6gren's disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. HSS was integral to the success of the previous AMP RA/SLE program, which pioneered a transformational approach to dissect how these diseases occur at the individual cell level. Dr. Anne Bass, Dr. Nilasha Ghosh, and Dr. Donlin are leading translational studies of the rheumatologic complications of checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer in collaboration with oncologists at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
