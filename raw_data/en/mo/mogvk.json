Anyone engaging with others in the building MUST wear a mask and practice social distancing. As NYS progresses in reopening we will have updates to share regarding our fitness room, gym and our assembly and kitchen rentals. OUR AIRBNB - We're very excited that the work is complete and our airbnb rooms are beautiful and ready to book. What this means during COVID-19: First - airbnb is defined by NYS as an ESSENTIAL BUSINESS providing essential housing to those in need as they travel and serve in their essential roles. What this means in our community is that we are here for you and that includes family members who need to come into town to care for their family members. To meet the most stringent guidelines we have chosen to participate in airbnb's Enhanced Cleaning Initiative and are taking every extra step to keep our guests and our staff safe. The cleaning protocol was developed by Dr. Vivek Murthy, the former U.S. Surgeon General, and by companies that helped set the standards for cleanliness in hospitality and the medical hygiene industry and is being informed and updated when necessary according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
