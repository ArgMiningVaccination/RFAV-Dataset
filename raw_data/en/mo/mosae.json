Our founders, Ellen Browning Scri pps and Mother Mary Michael Cummings, were both women ahead of their time. Their commitment to provide for the health care needs of a growing community resulted in the Scripps Health of today. Miss Ellen, as she was known, preferred t he term \"investment\" ov er \"donation\", and her contributions were carefully considered as mu ch for their future promise as for their immediate impact. Decades earlier , Mother Mary Michael's pat ient logs illustrated her fundamental mission to make quality health care available to all who needed it. Today, more than 17,000 employees, physicians and volunteers continue to build on our rich history and keep the spirit of commu nity service alive. The pages that follow provide a comprehensive account of how we achieve that: our community benefit programs and services, and our plans fo r continued action in the future. In fiscal year 2016, Scripps' community benefit contributions totaled $368,982,312. This includes $335,093,576 in uncompensated care, $24,201,857 in professional education and health research, $1,491,418 in communi ty building activities, $2,670,655 in community health services and $5,524,807 in subsidized health. Health care will continue to change in San Diego and across our count ry. At Scripps we are continually changing to better meet our patients' needs, improve access in our community reduce our costs, and simply brin g more value to the patients we serve. When Ellen Browning Scripps and Mother Mary Michael Cummings brought quality health care to San Diego around 100 years ago, they could nev er have imagined the care we provided today or the more than 700,000 lives we touch each year. As a private, tax-exempt health care system, Scripps will continue our legacy of making a vital and measurable difference in our community.

Passed in 1994, the bill requires California's community, not-for-p rofits hospitals to annually describe and document the full range of community benefits they provide. Scripps has taken this legislative requirement a step further. This report incorporates not only documentation of community benefits, but also a more detailed explanation of the spec ific community benefit activities provided by our five acute-care hospital campuses, home health care, wellness centers and clinics. The report details programs and services that provide comm unity benefits above and beyond standard practices of care. It is divi ded into three primary category areas: Uncompensated Health Care Community Health Services Professional Educatio n and Health Research The report covers the peri od of October 2015 through S eptember 2016 (fiscal year 2016) during this fiscal year, Scripp s devoted $368,982,312 to community benefit programs and services in the three areas listed above (see figures 1:1 and 1:2.) Our programs emphasize community-based prev ention efforts and use innovative approaches to reach residents at gr eatest risk for health problems. Definitions of the terms used in th is report can be found in Appendix A. The documentation and activities described in this report are commitments we make to improve the health of both our patients and the diverse San Diego communities. As a longstanding member of t hese communities, and as a not-for-profit community resource, our goal and responsibility are to a ssist all who come to us for care, and to reach out especially to those who find them selves vulnerable and without support. This responsibility is an intrinsic part of our mission. Through our continued actions and community partnerships, we strive to rais e the quality of life in the community as a whole. Community benefit is defined as programs or activities that provide treatment or promote health and healing in respons e to an identified community need. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 3 Community benefit programs must meet at least one of the following criteria: Respond to a public health need. Involve education or research that improves overall community health. Respond to needs of special populations. Supply services or programs that w ould likely be discontinued if the design was made on a purely financial basis because they operate at a financial loss. Schedule H (Form 990) Hospitals with tax-exempt st atus are required to provide information specific to their organization on Schedule H, Form 990 (the annual information return filed by tax- exempt organizations.) The entire Schedule H was mandatory beginning with tax year 20091 Scripps has aligned the 2017 Community B enefit Plan and report to the Schedule H categories. According to the IRS, community building acti vities, bad debt and Medicare shortfalls are reported, but not included in the community benefit totals.

Community Health Needs As sessment (CHNA) originated from California state wide legislation in the early 1900s. SB 697 took effect in 1995, which required private non-profit hospitals to submit detailed information to the Office of St atewide health Planning an d development (OSHPD) on their community benefit contributions. Annual hospital community benefit reports are summarized by OSHPD in a Report to the Legislature, which provides valuable information for government officials to assess the care and services provided to their constituents. The SB 697 requirement was supplemented in 2010 by requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA that not-for-profit hospitals conduct community health needs assessments with community stake holders to determine significant health needs of the community they serve and Implementation Strategies to help meet those needs. Additional information on the ACA requirements for nonprofit hospitals can be found at http://www.irs.gov , keyword: \"Charitable Organizations.\" For more detailed information on CHNA regulatory requirem ents and Implementation Strategy see Appendix E. As part of the federal reporting requirement for private, not-for-profit (tax exempt) hospitals, Scripps conducts a consolidated Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and corresponding joint Implementations strategy for its licensed hospital facilities every three years. This comprehensive account of health needs in the community is designed for hospitals to plan their community benefit programs together with other local health care institutions, community-based organizations and consumer groups. The 2016 Scripps Health CHNA is designed to prov ide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in San Diego County. The report will help us better understand our community's health needs, and inform community benefit planning and the Implementation Strategy for Scripps Health. In addition, the assessment allows interested parties and members of the community mechanism to access the full spectrum of information relative to the development of the Scripps Health 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment Report . Scripps strives to improve community health through collaboration. Working with other health systems, community groups, governm ent agencies, businesses and gr assroots movements, Scripps is better able to build upon existing assets to achieve broad community health goals. The complete report is available online at Scripps Health 2016 Community H ealth Needs Assessment Report. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 10Community Health Needs Assessment Executive Summary This Executive Summary provides a high- level summary of the 2016 CHNA methodology and findings. The full CHNA report contains in-depth information and explanati ons of the data that participating hospitals and healthca re systems will use to evaluate the health needs of their patients and determine, adapt, or create pr ograms at their facilities Grounded in a longstanding commitment to address community health needs in San Diego, seven hospitals and health care systems, including Scripps Health came together under the auspices of the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) to conduct a triennial Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) that i dentifies and prioritizes the most critical health- related needs of San Diego County residents. Part icipating hospitals will us e the findings to guide their community programs and meet IRS regulatory r equirements. Per legislation hospitals conduct a health needs assessment in the community once every three years. Based on the findings from the 2013 Communi ty Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and recommendations from the community, the 2016 CHNA was designed to provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in San Diego County. Participating hospitals will use this information to inform and guide hospital programs and strategies. This report includes an analysis of health outcomes and associated social determinants of health which create heal th inequities - 'the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries1 and communities-with the understanding t hat the burden of ill ness, premature death, and disability disproportionally affects racial and minority population groups and ot her underserved populations2. Understanding regional and population- specific differences is an important step to understanding and ultimately strategizing ways to make collective impact. These new insights will allow participating hospitals to identify effective strategies to addre ss the most prevalent and c hallenging health needs in the community. 1 World Health Organization.

The objective of the 2016 CHNA is to identify and prioriti ze the most critical health-related needs in San Diego County based on feedback from comm unity residents in high need neighborhoods and quantitative data analysis. The 2016 CHNA involved a mixed methods approach using the most current quantitative data available and more extensive qualitative out reach. Throughout the process, the IPH met bi-weekly with the HASD&IC CHNA co mmittee to analyzed, refine, and interpret results as they were being collected. The results of t he 2016 CHNA will be used to inform and adapt hospital programs and strategies to better meeting the health needs of San Diego County residents. Community Defined For the purposes of this 2016 CHNA, the service ar ea is defined as the entir e County of San Diego due to a broad representation of hospitals in the ar ea. Over three million peopl e live in the socially and ethnically diverse County of San Diego. Sele ct key demographic information is summarized in Figure 2:1 below. Figure 2:1. Selected Community Statistics* Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is a measur e of income issued every year by the Department of Health and Human Services. In 2017, the FPL for a family of four was $24,300. Additional information on socioec onomic factors, access to care , health behaviors, and the physical environment can be found in the full Scripps 2016 CHNA report at Scripps Health 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment Report. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 12 Because of its large geographic size and populat ion, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) organized their service ar eas into six geographic regions. Central, East, North Central, North Coastal, North Inland and S outh. When possible, data is presented at a regional level to provide more detailed understanding of the population. The geographical regions are represented below in Figure 2:2. Figure 2:2. San Diego County with Heal th and Human Services Agency Region 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 13 Scripps Health Community Served Hospitals and health care systems define the community served as those individuals residing within its service area. A hospital or health care syste m service area includes all residents in a defined geographic area surrounding the hospital. Scripps se rves the entire San Diego county region with services concentrated in North Coastal, North Central, Central and Sout hern region of San Diego. Community outreach efforts are focu sed in those areas with proximity to a Scripps facility. Scripps hosts, sponsors and participates in many comm unity-building events throughout the year.

Community outreach efforts are focused in those areas with proximit y to a Scripps facility. Figure 2:3 Scripps Health Service Area 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 15Community Priority Process (CHNA Methodology) The 2016 process began with a comprehensive scan of recent community health statistics in order to validate the regional significance of the top four health needs identif ied in the 2013 CHNA. The aim of the 2016 CHNA methodology was to provide a more comp lete understanding of the top four identified health needs and associated social determinants of health in the San Diego community. The 2013 methodology used to identify t he top four health needs is described in Figure 2:4. Figure 2:4 HASD&IC 2013 CHNA Methodology For a complete description of the HASD&IC 2013 process and findings, see full report available at http://www.hasdic.org/chna When the results of all of the data and information gat hered in 2013 were comb ined, four conditions emerged clearly as the top community health needs in San Diego County (in alphabetical order). 1.

Figure 2:5 provides an overvi ew of the process used to identify and prioritize the health needs for the HASD&IC 2016 CHNA. For the purposes of the CHNA, a \"health need\" is defined as a health outcome and/or the related conditi ons that contribute to a defined health outcome. Figure 2:5. 2016 CHNA Process Map 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 17 The 2016 CHNA process began with a comprehensive sc an of recent community health statistics in order to validate the regional significance of the top four health needs identified in the 2013 CHNA. Quantitative data fo r both the HASD&IC 2016 CHN A and SMH 2016 CHNA included 2013 OSHPD demographic data for hospital inpati ent, emergency department (ED), and ambulatory care encounters to understand the hospital patient population. Clinic data was also gathered from OSHPD's website and incorporated in order to provide a more holistic view of health care utilization in SDC. The variabl es analyzed are included in Table 2:3 below and were analyzed at the ZIP code level wherever possible. Table 2:3. Variables Analyzed in the HASD&IC and SMH 2016 CHNAs Secondary Data Variables Hospital Utilization: Inpatient discharges, ED and ambulatory care encounters Community Clinic Visits Demographic Data (socio-economic indicators) Mortality and Morbidity Data Regional Program Data (childhood obesity trends and community resource referral patterns) Social Determinants of Health and Health Behaviors (education, income, insurance, physical enforce ment, physical activity, diet and substance abuse) Identify Vulnerable Communities Recognizing that health needs differ across the regi on and that socioeconomic factors impact health outcomes, the IPH used the Dignit y Health/Truven Health Community Need Index (CNI) to identify communities within San Diego County with the highes t level of health dispar ities and needs. The CNI score is an average of five different barrier scores that measure various so cioeconomic indicators of each community using the 2013 source data. The five barriers used to determine CNI scores are : CNI Color Scale Income barrier Culture barrier Educational barrier Insurance barrier Housing barrier 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 18 The map shown below is based on CNI score for San Diego County area of hi gh need (CNI score of 4 to 5) are individuals with red or orange while areas of low need (CNI score of 1 to 3 are yellow or green). The CNI data and the hospital discharge rate by pr imary diagnosis for the health conditions: Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and behavioral health. For a detailed descripti on of the CNI visit the interactive website at http://cni.chw-interacive.org/ Figure 2:6. San Diego Count y Community Need Index, 2013 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 19 Community Engagement Activities Community engagement activities were conduct ed with a broad range of people including heath experts, community leaders, and San Diego residents, in an effo rt to gain a more complete understanding of the top i dentified health needs in the San Die go community. Individuals who were consulted included representative from state, local tribal, or other regional government al public health departments (or equivalent department or agency) as well as leaders, represent atives, or members of medically underserved, low income, and minority populations. Figure 2:7 below outlines the number and type of community engagement activities conducted as part of the collaborative HASD&IC 2016 CHNA. Community input was gathered through the following activities: Behavioral Health Discussions Community Partner Discussions Key Informant Interviews Health Access and Navigation Survey San Diego County HHSA Survey Figure 2:7. HASD&IC 2016 CHNA Co mmunity Engagement Activities The overall purpose of collecting community input was to gather information about the health needs and social determinants specific to San Di ego County. Specific objectives included: Gather in depth feedback to aid in the under standing of the most significant health needs impacting San Diego County. Connect the identified health needs with associated social determinants of health. Aid in the process of prioritizing health needs within San Diego County. Gain information about the system and policy changes within San Diego County that could potentially impact the health needs and social determinants of health. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 20 Findings and Prioritized Health Conditions The Collaborative, HASD&IC 2016 CHNA prioriti zed the top health needs for San Diego County overall through the application of the following five criteria: 1. Magnitude or Prevalence 2. Severity 3. Health Disparities 4. Trends 5. Community Concern Using these criteria, a summary matrix translati ng the 2016 CHNA findings was created for review by the CHNA Committee. As a result of this review, the CHNA Committee identified behavioral health as the number one health need in SDC. In addition, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity were identified as having equal importance due to their interrelatedness. Health needs were further broken down into priority areas due to the overwhelming agreement among al l data sources and in recognition of the complexities with each health nee d. Within the category of behavio ral health, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, drug and alcohol issues, and mood disorder s are significant health needs with San Diego County. Among the other chronic health needs, hy pertension was consistently found to be a significant priority area related to cardiovascu lar disease, uncontrolled diabetes was an important factory leading to complication related to diabetes , and obesity was often found to co-occur with other conditions and contribute to worsening health st atus. The impact of the top health needs differed among age groups; with Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and anxiety affecting all age groups, drug and alcohol issues affecting teens and adults, and Alzh eimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension affecting older adults. Figure 2:8 illustrates the prioritization of the tops health needs for SDC. Figure 2:8 HASD&IC 2016 CHNA Top Health Needs 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 21 Social Determinants of Health In addition to the health outcome needs that were ident ified, social determinants of health were a key theme in all of the community engagem ent activities. Analysis of resu lts from the community partner discussions and key Informant interviews rev ealed the most commonly associated social determinants of health for each of the top he alth needs above. Ten social determinants were consistently referenced across the different community engagement activities. The importance of these social determinants was also confirmed by quantitative data. Hospital programs and community collaborations have the potential to impact these social determinants, which are outlined below in order of priority. Figure 2:9. Social Determinants of Health, HASD&IC 2016 CHNA 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 22 Community Recommendations Following the completion of the community engagement activities, a ll of the different types of feedback were combined and analyzed. Four key ca tegories emerged: overarching strategies to address the top health needs; resources that must be increased or develop ed to meet the health needs; system, policy and environmental changes that could support better health outcomes, and possible collaborations to improve access and quality of care for vulnerable populations. A compilation of the overarch ing recommendations is below. Figure 2:10. Summary of Communit y Recommendations, HASD&IC 2016 CHNA 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 23 Phase 2 of the 2016 CHNA The CHNA Committee is in the process of worki ng on Phase 2 of the 2016 CHNA, which includes gathering community feedback on the 2016 CHNA process and strengthening partnerships around the identified health needs and social determi nants. In November 2016, the HASD&IC CHNA workgroup and IPH conducted an electronic survey to determine whether or not the broader community agrees with the 2016 CHN A findings. Of the 132 respondents that completed the survey, 30 worked in hospitals or hospital-based settings, while the remaining 102 respondents self-identified as working for a range of entitie s including but not limited to community clinics, non-profits, community based organizations, local government, and health insurance plans. A summary of key findings from the survey is present ed in the following section. In addition to soliciting feedback on the findings, t he survey also included questions seeking to determine whether the integration of behavioral health and physical health is being integrated locally, as well as whether organizations are screening for and addressing social determinants of health. Ninety nine respondents stated that their organization screens patient s and clients about their social determinants of health. Access to care of services topped the list, along with homeless/housing issues and insurance issues (details below in T able 2:4). Ninety four respondents shared information about how they screen patients and document the informat ion. Findings clearly indicate that these organizations are screening patients for social deter minants and making referrals, but indications are that follow-up is somewhat limited (details below in Table 2:5). There is strong interest on the part of respondents in learning more about the ways that our community partners are screening clients and patients. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 24 Table 2:4 What social determinants of health does your organization screen for?

The results of the community survey will guide individual hospi tal programs and plans, and will also help refine the CHNA process for 2019. Hospital and healthcare systems that parti cipated in the HASD&IC 2016 CHNA process have varying requirements for next steps. Priv ate, not-for-profit (t ax exempt) hospitals and healthcare systems are required to develop hospital or healthcare system community health needs assessment reports and implementation strategy plans to address selected identified health needs. The participating public hospitals and healthca re systems do not have federal or state CHNA requirements, but work very closely with their patient communities to address health needs by providing programs, resour ces, and opportunities for collaboration with partners. Every participating hospital and h ealthcare system will review the CHNA data and findings in accordance with their own pati ent communities and principal functions, and evaluate opportunities for next steps to a ddress the top identifie d health needs in their respective patient communities. The CHNA report is made available as a re source to the broader community and may serve as a useful resource to both re sidents and healthcare providers to further communitywide health improvement efforts. Table 2:5 How does your organization identify and/or document patients' social determinants of health? (n=94) % Refer patients to resources that address social determinants of health. 76.6% Ask standardized screening questions on specific social determinants of health. 71.3% Casually talk with patients to gather information on possible social determinants of health. 63.8% Document any identified social determinants of health within the patients' chart or records. 62.8% Followup with patients who were identified with high risk social determinants of health. 42.6% Conduct trend analysis on the social determinants of health identified for your patients and clients. 20.2% Other 9.6% Total 100% 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 25 Scripps Health Implementation Plan With the 2016 CHNA complete and health priori ty areas identified, Scripps Health has developed a corresponding Implement ation Strategy - a multif aceted, multi-stakeholder, plan that addresses the community health needs identified in the CHNA. The Implementation Plan translates the resear ch and analysis presented in the Assessment into actual, measurable strategies and objec tives that can be carried out to improve community health outcomes. Scripps Health anticipates t he implementation strategies may evolve due to the fast pace at which community and health care industry change. Therefore, a flexible approach is best suited for the development of its response to the Scripps Health Community Health Needs Assessment ( CHNA). On an annual basis Scripps Health evaluates the implementati on strategy and its resources and interventions; and makes adjustments as needed to achieve its stated goal s and outcome measures as well as to adapt to changes and resources available. Scripps describes any challenges encountered to achieve the outcomes and makes modifications as needed. In addition, Scripps Health Implementati on Plan is filed with the Internal Revenue Service using Form 990 Schedule H on an annual basis. In response to identified unmet health needs in the 2016 Community Heal th Needs Assessment, during FY17-FY19 Scripps Health is focusing on the strategi es and initiatives, their measures of implementation and the metrics used to evaluate their effectiveness. Scripps will monitor and evaluate the strategi es listed in the Implementation Plan for the purpose of tracking the implementation of thos e strategies as well as the document the anticipated impact. Plans to monitor will be tailo red to each strategy and will include the collection and documentation of tracking measure. The complete FY17-FY19 Implementation Plan Report is available online at Scripps.org. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 26 1 Scripps Mission SECTION 3 Uncompensated Health Care 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan and Report 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 27 UNCOMPENSATED HEALTH CARE Scripps contributes significant resources to provide low and no-cost health care for our patients in need. During fiscal year 2016, Scripps contri buted $335,093,576 in uncompensated health care, including $23, 824,941 in charity care, $304,933,898 in Medi- Cal and Medicare shor tfall, and $6,334, 737 in bad debt. Scripps provides hospital services for one-qu arter of the county's uninsured patients. Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego and Scripp s Mercy Hospital, Chula Vista provide 57 percent of Scripps' charity care (refer to figure 3:3). The health care safety net in San Diego County is highly dependent upon hospitals and community health clinics to care for uninsured and medica lly underserved communities. Finding more effective ways to coordinate and enhance the safety net is a critical policy challenge. While public subsidies help finance serv ices for San Diego County's uninsured populations, these subsidies do not cover the full cost of care. Combined with Medi-Cal and Medicare funding shortfalls, Scripps and other local hospitals absorb the cost of caring for uninsured patients in their oper ating budgets. This places a significant financial burden on hospitals and physicians. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 28 Demographic Profile of San Diego County Current population demographi cs and changes in demographic composition over time play a determining role in the types of health and social services needed by communities. Population size, change in po pulation, race and ethnicity, and age of a population are all important in understanding communities and its residents. Population: Over three million people (3,138,265) live in the 4,205 square mile area of San Diego County (SDC) according to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2009-13, 5-year estimates. The popul ation density for this area, estimated at 746 persons per square mile, is greater than the national average population density of approximately 88 persons per square mile. A pproximately 96.7% of the population lives in an urban area compared to just 3.3% living in rural areas. Population Change: According to the U.S. Census Bureau Decennial Census, between 2000 and 2010 the population in SDC grew by 281,480 persons, a change of 10.0%. This is similar to the percentage population change seen during the same time period in California (10.0%) and the United States (9.7 %). A significant shift in total population over time impacts the demand for health care providers and the utilization of community resources. Race/Ethnicity: In the U.S. Census Bureau Amer ican Community Survey 2009-2013, data for race and ethnicity are collected separ ately. Of those who identified as non- Hispanic (67.7%) in SDC, the majority identif ied their race as White (70.9%), followed by Asian (16.1%), Black (7.1%), Multiple Races (4.5%), and American Indian/Alaskan Na tive (0.5%). Of those who identified as Hispanic or Latino (32.4%) in SDC, the majo rity also identified their race as White (72.4%), followed by other (19.9%), Multiple Races (5 .1%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (1.1%), Asian (0.6%), a nd Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (0.1%). Please see the figures below for more details. San Diego's Uninsured The lack of health insurance is considered a key driver of health status. Between 2010 and 2013 uninsured rate was relatively stable in the United States, California and in San Diego County. In 2014, the uninsured rate sharply decreased to 12.3% which was the largest change in the uninsured rate throughout this period. This decrease can be attributed in large part to t he Affordable Care Act (ACA). 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 29 Socioeconomic Factors There are three indicators determined to be the most powerful predictors of population health: poverty rate, percent of population uninsured, and educational attainment. Low- income, uninsured, and undereducated individuals have been found to be most at risk for poor health status. Five-year estimates from the 2009-2013 American Community Survey (ACS) show how these indicators impact the San Diego community. Evaluating these risk factors is important for identifying communities with the most significant health needs and health disparities. Poverty: Within San Diego County, 14.5% or 441,648 individuals are living in households with income below 100% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). For children 0-17, the percentage living 100% below the FPL increases to 18.8%. For a household size of 3 the 100% poverty level is $20,090 per year. Poverty creates barriers to accessing services that promote will-being including health services, healthy food, and other necessities that contribute to improved health status. Educational Attainment: Educational attainment is linked to positive health outcomes (Freudenberg & Ruglis, 2007).Within the County of San Diego, almost 15% of the total population aged 25 and older (297,188) have no high school diploma (or equivalency) or higher. Of children aged 3-4, the 2009-2013 ACS found that 48.9% were enrolled in school. As a primary social determinant of health, increasing educational opportunities for young children is important in order to improve future educational attainment and increase economic opportunity. The Changing Landscape under the Affordable Care Act* The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has played a significant role in increasing access to healthcare. In 2014, a number of changes took effect in California including: The expansion of Med-Cal to individuals making less than 138% of the poverty level The establishment of Covered California for individuals who make up the 400% of the poverty level to purchase subsidized health insurance The elimination of discrimination due to pre-existing conditions The requirement to obtain health insurance coverage These healthcare reforms have resulted in a large number of newly insured individuals. Recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau demonstrates the following changes in coverage as of 2014: Decrease in the percentage of uninsured overall in the U.S. from 13.3% in 2013 to 10.4% in 2014 Decrease in the percentage of uninsured children under age 19 from 7.5% to 6.2% Decrease in the percentage of uninsured across ethnic groups to 19.9%, 11.8%, 9.3% and 7.6% for Hispanics, blacks, Asians and non- Hispanic whites, respectively. Still, discrepancies remain with those aged 19- 64 least likely to be in sured and roughly 1 in 5 Hispanics still lacking health insurance. *Smith, Jessica C. and Carla Medali a, U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Reports, P60-253, Heal th Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2014, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 2015. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 30 Uninsured: Between 2010 and 2013 uninsured rate was relatively stable in the United States, California and in SDC. In 2014, t he uninsured rate sharply decreased to 12.3%, which was the largest change in the unins ured rate throughout this period. This decrease can be attributed in large part to the Affordable Care Ac t (ACA). For more information regarding the impact of the ACA, please see page 28 'The Changing the Landscape under the Affordable Care Act.' Lack of insurance is a primary barrier to health care access including regular primar y care, specialty care, and other health services that contributes to poor health status. Percent Uninsured: United States, California and San Diego County, 2010 - 2014 Data Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 to 2014 1-Year American Community Surveys. ACS uninsured rate is based on whether an individual had insurance at the time of the survey. Note: The American Community Survey, estimates are for the civilian noninstitutionalized population. This is different from the percentage uninsured cited in 'The Changing Landscape under the Affordable Care Act' box on the previous page, which used the CPS ASEC. The CPS ASEC uninsured rate represents the percentage of people who had no health insurance coverage at any time during the previous calendar year.

Linguistically Isolated Population: Given SDC's large immigrant and refugee population, the indicator linguistically isolated is espec ially important to under standing health in the community. According to the ACS, approxim ately 8.5% of the population aged five and older live in a home in which no person 14 y ears old and over speaks only English, or speaks a non-English language but does not speak English \"very well\". Similar to those with limited English profici ency, linguistically isolated po pulations may struggle with accessing health services, communicating with health care providers, and understanding health information. Unemployment: According to the Bureau of Labor St atistics, total unemployment in SDC for the month of July 2015 was 106,822, or 6.9%, of t he civilian non-institutionalized population age 16 and older (non- seasonally adjusted). Unempl oyment creates financial instability and barriers to accessing necessi ties such as health services and healthy food that contribute to improved health status. Summary of Social Determinants of Health, 2009-2013 Data Source: U.S. Census Bureau , American Community Survey. 2009-2013 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 32 Financial Assistance Assisting Low-Income, Uninsured Patients The Scripps financial assistance policy is co nsistent with the l anguage of both State (AB774) California Hospital Fair Pricing l egislation and the Inter nal revenue Code (IRC) 501 (r) Regulations. These practices reflect our commitment to assisting low-income and uninsured patients with discounted hospital char ges, charity care and flexible billing and debt collection practices. These program s are available to everyone in need, regardless of their race, ethnicity , gender, religion or national origin. Scripps makes every effort to identify patients who may benef it from financial assistance as soon as possible and provide counsel ing and language interpretation addition, Scripps does not apply wage garnishment or liens on primary residences as a way of collecting unpaid hospital bills. Eligibility for financial assistance is based on family income and expenses. For low- income, uninsured patients who earn less than t wice the federal poverty level. (FPL), Scripps forgives the entire bill. For thos e patients who earn betwe en two and four times the FPL, a portion of the bill is forgiven. Patients who qualify for financial assistance are not charged more than Scripps' discounted financial assistance amount. For 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services def ined a family of four at 200 percent federal poverty level as $48,600. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 33FY16 Scripps System Uncompensated Health Care Summary (After Provider Fee) Title Financial Support* Bad Debt $6,334,737 Charity Care $23,824,941 Medi-Cal (Shortfall)** $58,494,206 and Medicare (Shortfall) *** $246,439,692 SCRIPPS TOTAL FY16 UNCOMPENSATED CARE $335,093,576 SCRIPPS SCHEDULE H FY16 UNCOMPENSATED CARE (Excludes Bad Debt and Medicare Shortfalls) $82,319,147 *Financial Support is: Calculations for bad debt and charity care are estimated by extracting the gross write- offs of bad debt and charity care charges and applying the hospital ratio of costs to charges (RCC) to estimate the cost of care.

Per Section 2 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), behavioral health was i dentified as the number one health need in San Diego County. Among t he other chronic health needs, hypertension was consistently found to be a signi ficant priority area related to cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes was an im portant factor leading to complications related to diabetes, and obesity was often found to co-o ccur with other conditions and contribute to worsening health status. The impact of the top health needs differed among age groups, with Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and anx iety affecting all age groups, drug and alcohol issues affecting teens and adults, and Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension affecting older adults In addition to the health outcome needs that were identified, social determinants of health were a key theme in all of the co mmunity engagement activities. Analysis of results from the community partner discussi ons and key Informant interviews revealed the most commonly associated social determi nants of health for each of the top health needs. Ten social determinants were consis tently referenced across the different community engagement activities. The import ance of these social determinants was also confirmed by quantitative data. Hospit al programs and community collaborations have the potential to impact these social determinants, which ar e outlined below in order of priority: Food Insecurity & Access to Healthy Food Access to Care or Services Homeless/Housing Issues Physical Activity Education/Knowledge Cultural Competency Transportation Insurance Issues Stigma Poverty 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 42 The programs included in this section ra ise public awareness and understanding of the community health needs documented in Sc ripps 2016 Community Needs Assessment Report (Refer to Section 2, Communi ty Health Needs Assessment (CHNA)1 Included in this section are other health conditions and needs that Scripps addresses via community benefit programs and initiati ves. Scripps defines Community Health services according to the Schedule H 990 categories mandated by the IRS. Then are broken down into five main areas: (see the Scripps Community Health Services Summary list for more details, page 95). Thes e cost are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part I Lines 7 e, g and i. Community health improvement services Community benefit operations Cash and in-kind contributions Subsidized health services Community building activities During fiscal year 2016 (October 2015 to September 2016), Scripps invested $2,670,655 in community health services ( does not include subsidized health). This figure reflects the costs associated with prov iding these programs, salaries, materials, and supplies minus revenue. Here are a few highlights of activities conducted by Scripps during fiscal year 2016. Refer to Figure 4:1 for a graphic representat ion of the FY16 Scripps system Community Health Services program distribution. Access to Care Two primary barriers to obtaining health care , on both the local and national level, are lack of health insurance and access to specia lty and primary care providers. Reduced access to basic health care services incr eases illness, injury and mortality and is a major burden on hospitals and health provider s, who must provide uncompensated care for the uninsured. More people without insu rance translates into higher use of emergency departments, which by law must provide stabilizi ng care to all patients, regardless of their ability to pay. 1 Demographic and community need information data presented throughout the body of this document are based upon the findings of the San Diego Hospital Association and Imperial Counties 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment and the most recent San Diego County community health statistics (unless otherwise indicated). Retrieved from the World Wide Web http://www.hasdic.org/chna.htm 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 43 In an effort to provide for people in need, Scripps sponsored a number of programs in fiscal year 2016. Mercy Outreach Surgical Team Working in Mexico, the Mercy Outreach Surgical Team (M.O.S.T) provides reconstructive surgeries for children suffering from birth defects or accidents. In special circumstances, surgeries are also provi ded for adults. During fiscal year 2016, the M.O.S.T team served in two outreach missi on trips. The M.O.S. T team volunteered 4,088 hours to provide reconstructive su rgeries for more than 800 people served. (Sponsored by Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego and affiliated physicians). Scripps Recuperative Care Program (RCU) The Scripps Rescue Mission Project provides a safe discharge for chronically homeless patients with ongoing medical needs. All patients are unfunded or underfunded. Most have substance abuse and/or mental health i ssues. The lack of funding and mental illness, along with alcohol and/or substance abuse, make post-acute placement of these homeless patients difficult. RN case management oversight is provided by Scripps with physician back up to ensure completion of t heir medical recovery goals. Scripps pays the Rescue Mission a daily rate for housing and services provided to the patient. They provide a safe, secure environment with 24 hour supervision, medication oversight, meals, clothing, and counseli ng assistance with county medical services, Medi-Cal and disability applications, plus help find pe rmanent or transitional housing. Patient transportation needs are coordinated and pr ovided by both the Rescue Mission and Scripps. To maintain the patient's medi cal stability, medications, DME and other services are provided by Scripps until insuranc e funding has been established. Patients with psychiatric disorder are connected with a psychiatrist in the community and all patients are connected with a m edical home in the community. In 2016, 68 patients had a cumulative 1,518 hospi tal days of stay before going to the RCU. The RCU has taken medically comp lex patients, including those with tracheotomies, feeding tubes, IV antibiotics, wound vacs, multiple fractures, abscess, osteomyelitis, paraplegia, ESRD on dialys is, end stage liver disease, heart valve replacement, diabetes, traumatic brain injury or encephalopathy, os tomies, craniotomy, complex trauma, CVA, cancer, HIV/AIDS, and a patient with and external defibrillator, the Life Vest. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 44 Graduate Medical Education Staff S upport, St. Vincent de Paul Village Medical Center and St. Leo's Clinic The Graduate Medical Education (GME) pr ogram at Scripps Green Hospital and Scripps Clinic focuses on physician training and clinical research, with 40 residents and 36 fellows. Weekly community clinics were hel d at the St. Vincent de Paul and St. Leo's clinics. Staffed by Scripps Green Hospital and Scripps Clinic internal medicine residents, these clinics car ed for approximately 800 of our county's most vulnerable residents during fiscal year 2016. (Sponsored by Scripps Clinic/Green Hospital) Fiji Alliance Project In partnership with the International Relief Teams of San Diego and the Loloma Foundation, Scripps employees, Scripps Clinic physicians and other Scripps affiliated physicians provided medical and surgical servic es in Fiji. As one of their rotations, residents from Scripps Clinic and Scripps Green Hospital have the opportunity to participate in these medical missions. The t eam performs procedures to remedy cleft lips and palates, eyelid, face and feet def ormities, burn scars, breast masses and hernias, as well as providing diabetes management. All surgical supplies were donated by Professional Hospital Supply Corporation (PHS), the supplier fo r Scripps Health. The supplies included surgical gowns, gloves, dr apes, dressings, sutures, etc. Cardinal Health Systems, which provides pharmaceut icals and other supplies for Scripps Health, donated all medications. (Sponsored by Scripps Clinic/Green Hospital) Scripps Health Community Benefit (CB) Fund In fiscal year 2016, Scripps Health conti nued to deepen its commitment to philanthropy with its Community Benefit Fund . Over the course of the y ear, it awarded $212,000 in community grants to programs in San Die go (five grants rangi ng from $10,000 to $120,000). The funded projects address some of San Diego County's high priority health needs, seeking to improve access to vital health care services for at risk populations, including the homeless, economic ally disadvantaged, mentally ill and others. Since the Community Benefit F und began, Scripps has awarded $3.3 million. Programs funded during fiscal year 2016 include: Consumer Center for Health E ducation and Advocacy (CCHEA) Funding provides low income, uninsured Mercy Clinic and Behavioral Health patients help obtaining health care benefits, SSI and related services, while reducing 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 45 uncompensated care expenses at Mercy. The project provides advocacy services for time intensive government benefit cases Catholic Charities Funding provides short term emergency shel ter for medically fragile homeless patients being discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospit al, San Diego. The program is being expanded to Scripps Mercy Hospital, Chul a Vista. Case management and shelter are provided for homeless patients discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospital. While these patients no longer require hospital care, they do need a short term recuperative environment. Patients who demonstrate a willingne ss to change receive one week in a hotel, along with food and bus fare to purs ue a case plan. The focus of the case management is to stabilize the client by helping them connect to more permanent sources of income, housing and other self-re liance measures. The partnership seeks to reduce emergency room recidivism in this p opulation and improve t heir quality of life. 2-1-1 Health Care Navigation Program Locally, 2-1-1 San Diego was launched in June 2005 as a multilingual and confidential service committed to providing 24/7 acce ss. There was an overwhelming need for a dependable service to help people navigate today's complex health care system. Scripps Health has been a longtime supporter of 2-1-1 San Diego's Health Navigation Program which creates a record for every pe rson who calls, so as to provide a service that navigates clients through different referrals and tracks their success toward achieving improved social determinants of health. Between July 2, 2015 and June 30, 2016, the percentage of clients with health insurance was 82% , a three percent increase from the previous year. As more people begin to have health insurance, 2-1-1 expects that client needs will also begin to shift from seeking to obtain coverage to learning how to use their coverage. Many of the Health Navigation Program's clients are already seeking the latter. This past year, Navigators provided a deeper level of care coordination, preventative support, and advocacy to about 1,000 clients. Compared to clients who received basic Information and Re ferral services, clients who received the deeper level of support reported a higher rate of confidence in managing their health needs (49% confidence among I&R clients, compared to 65% confidence among care coordination clients). American Heart Association Scripps provided funding for the 2016 Heart Wa lk through corporate sponsorship. Heart disease and stroke are the number one and thr ee causes of death in the nation. Heart 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 46 disease claims more than 950,000 Americans each year. Scripps partners with the American Heart Association on its annual Hear t Walk to raise funds for research, professional and public education and advocacy. Cancer/Oncology Cancer is a term used to describe a group of diseases that cause the uncontrolled growth, invasion, and spread (metastasis) of abnormal cells. Cancer is caused by external factors such as env ironmental conditions, radiati on, infectious organisms, poor diet and lack of exercise, and tobacco use, as well as internal factors such as genetic mutations, and hormones. Cancer is the sec ond leading cause of death in the United States. Cancer causes one out of ever y four deaths in the United States. In 2013 cancer was the leading cause of death in SDC, responsible for 24.4 percent of deaths. There were 5,030 deaths due to c ancer (all sites), and an age adjusted death rate of 155.6 deaths per 100,000 population.2 According to a 2016 report from the American Cancer Societ y, California Cancer Facts & Figures, cancer survival is more likely to be successful if the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. Such diagnosis is an indi cation of screening and early detection. Regular screening that allow for the early detection and removal of precancerous growths are known to reduce mortality for ca ncers of the cervix, colon and rectum. Five year relative survival rates for common c ancers, such as breast, prostate, colon and rectum, cervix, and melanoma of the skin, ar e 93 percent to 100 percent if they are discovered before having spread beyond the organ where the cancer began. In 2013, the percentage of cancer cases diagnosed at an early age is lowest among African American women for breast and Hispani c males for prostate in SDC. Most Commonly Diagnosed Cancers Prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers ar e the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the leading causes of cancer related deat h among men. Similarly, breast, lung, and colorectal cancers are the most commonl y diagnosed cancers and the leading causes of cancer related death among women. For both sexes combined, melanoma of the skin is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer and pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related death. 2 County of San Diego HHSA, Public Health Services, Community Epidemiology Branch 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 47 Cancer Disparities The burden of cancer does not fall equally on all Californians, and risk of developing cancer varies considerably by race/ethni city. Among men, African Americans have the highest incidence and mortality from cancer , followed by non-Hispanic whites. Among women, non-Hispanic whites have the highe st incidence of cancer, but African Americans have the highest cancer mortalit y. In general, persons of Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic origin have cancer ra tes that are about 30 to 35 percent lower than non-Hispanic whites. However, Asian/Pa cific Islanders and Hispanics are two to three time more likely than non-Hispanic wh ites to develop stomach and liver cancer. Hispanic women also have twice the risk of being diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer relative to non-Hispanic white women. Scripps has developed a series of prevent ion and wellness programs to educate people about the importance of early detection and treatment for some of the most common forms of cancer. At Scripps, cancer care is more than just m edical treatment, and a wide array of resources are provided such as counseling, support groups, complementary therapies and educational workshops. Here are a few examples of Scripps cancer programs during fiscal year 2016: Scripps Cancer Center Directory of Community Resources Scripps collaborates with the community and develops a cancer directory of a comprehensive list of resources available fo r cancer survivors, their families, and the community. Scripps Green Cancer C enter Support Groups Scripps Green Hospital support groups offer c ancer patients the oppor tunity to express the emotions that come with a cancer diag nosis and help them cope more effectively with their treatment regimens by support groups that nurture their physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. Classes at Scripps Green Cancer Center, such as the free cancer writing workshop, \"When Words Heal,\" use expressive writing to help patients navigate their jour ney with cancer. Health Science Middle School - City Heights Educational Tour Health Science Mid-High School (6th to 8th graders) from City Heights (40 students and 2 instructors) spent two hours at Scripps Me rcy San Diego O'Toole Breast Care Center.

In addition 'Cerebrovascular Diseases' were the fifth leading cause of death, and Essential (primary) hypertension and hypertensive renal diseas e' was the tenth. Coronary Heart Disease is the most common form of heart disease. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are all risk factors that could lead to CVD and stroke. About half of Americans (49%) have at least one of these three risk factors. Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease: Behaviors: Tobacco use, obesity, poor diet that is high in saturated fats, and excessive alcohol use. Conditions: High cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Heredity: Genetic factors likely play a role in heart disease and can increase risk. Heart Disease is the Leading Cause of Death in the United States Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most racial/ethnic groups in the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics and whites. Prevalence Data In 2012, 11.1% of adults aged 18 and over had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had heart disease. In 2012, 224% of adults 18 and over had been to ld on two or more visits that they had hypertension. Disparities and Cardiovascular Disease In 2012, thirty five percent of non- Hispanic black women had hypertension compared with 22% of non-Hispanic wh ite women and 22% of Hispanic women. Thirty percent of non-Hispanic black men had hypertension compared with 25% of non-Hispanic white men and 19% of Hispanic men. Men are more likely than women to have ever been hold they have coronary heart disease or hypertension. Individuals with low incomes are much more likely to suffer from high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. The World Health Organization defines cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels that include: Coronary heart disease Cerebrovascular disease Peripheral arterial disease Rheumatic heart disease Congenital heart disease Deep vein thrombosis Pulmonary embolism. Coronary Heart Disease is the most common form of heart disease and the leading cause of death in the U.S. high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are all risk factors that could lead to CVD and stroke. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 53 Among adults aged 65 and over, those cover ed by Medicare and Medicaid were more likely to have been told they had hypertension that those with either Medicare alone or private insurance. Depression occurs in up to 20% of peopl e with heart disease and has also been found to be a risk factor for subsequent heart attacks. During fiscal year 2016, Scripps engaged in the following heart health, cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment activities. American Heart Association - Heart Walk In addition, Scripps employees volunteered thei r time to coordinate walker participation and fundraising efforts.

The Eric Paredes Save A Life Foundation Each year, 7,000 teens lose their lives due to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). SCA is not a heart attack, it is caused by an abnormality in the heart's electrical system that can easily be detected with a simple EKG. Unfort unately, heart screenings are not part of a regular, well-child exam or pr e-participation sports physica l. The first symptom of SCA could be death. San Diego alone loses three to five teens from SCA. As a sponsor for 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 55 the Eric Paredes Save A Life Foundation, Scripps has held more than 20,000 free cardiac screenings to local teens, includi ng the homeless, uninsured and underinsured. In 2016, Scripps made a $15,000 donation to help pay for screenings. In 2016, Scripps supported screening events at area high schools and screened 3,869 teens, identifying 41 with abnormalities and 16 who were at risk. Screening Athletes for Sudden Cardiac Arrest Every year, three to five student athlet es in San Diego County die suddenly and unexpectedly from Sudden Cardiac Arrest/Deat h (SCA/D). SCA is an abnormality in the heart's electrical system that can happen without symptoms or warning signs. However, this life-threatening condition can be detected with a cardiac screening exam. Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Fam ily Medicine Residency, Southwest Sports Wellness Foundation and the Sweetwater Union Hi gh School District partner to prevent sudden cardiac arrest and death among high school students by increasing awareness of the importance of healthy lifestyles and cardiovascular screenings among active students.

Su Vida, Su Corazon / Your Life, Your Heart Community Intervention to Improve Education and Awarene ss of Heart Disease Heart disease is one of the most widespr ead and costly health problems facing our nation, even though it's also one of the mo st preventable. Heart failure and stroke account for more than $500 billi on in health care costs per year. Heart failure is a progressive disease, primarily caused by high blood pressure, high cholesterol/lipids and damage to the heart muscle fr om coronary artery disease. Scripps Health offers a five week educatio nal based community intervention program to support improved quality of life for patients diagnosed with heart disease. Tobacco use, alcohol abuse, lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, stress and depression are some of the major contributing fact ors leading to heart disease, heart failure and readmission. Recent literature suggest that a lack of pos t discharge social support and education are important to prevent readmission. Group se ssions provide education and social support. Discharge planning that uses transitional coaches has been proven to reduce readmission rates. The overall goal of Y our Life, Your Heart is to decrease the readmission rates for heart failu re patients, which reduces m edical costs for the patient and improves their quality of life. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 56 A total of 51 community members have partici pated in this educational series for those affected by hypertension, angina, cardia c heart failure or any other heart health concerns. Topics covered include the risk of heart disease, signs of heart attack, diabetes, cholesterol, physical activity, healthy eating and much more. With 19 heart health participants still active in the program health assessments are reviewed including waist circumference, weight, height, BMI and blood pressure. Overall, participants have improved their BMI by 6.9%, lost a comb ined 42 pounds together, and improved their blood pressure at an average of 131/74 (t hree times normalized and maintained since initial assessment). 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 57 Diabetes Diabetes is an important health need because of its prevalence, its impact on morb idity and mortality, and its preventability. An analysis of mortality data for San Diego County found that in 2012 'Diabetes mellitus' was the seventh leading cause of deat h. The percentage of adults aged 20 and older who have ever been diagnosed with diabetes was 7.2% in 2012 in San Diego County and has been steadily rising since 2005 according to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Type 2 diabetes is an important target for intervention because hospitalizations due to diabetes related complications are potentially preventable with proper management and a healthy lifestyle. In San Diego, approximately 1.5% of dischar ges in the black patient population were attributable to diabetes compared to 0.7% of discharges of whites. There are three major types of diabetes: Ty pe 1, Type 2 and gestational. All three types share similar characteristics, t he body loses the ability to eit her make or to use insulin. Without enough insulin, glucose stays in the blood, creating dang erous blood sugar levels. Over time, this buildup damages ki dneys, heart, nerves, eyes and other organs. Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult onset or noninsulin dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), which is your body's main source of fuel. With Ty pe 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin, a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. If left untreated, Type 2 diabetes can be life threatening. Clinical symptoms can include: frequent urination, excessive thirst, extreme hunger , sudden vision changes, unexplained weight loss, extreme fatigue, sores t hat are slow to heal, and incr eased number of infections. Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic propor tions, and people of Hispanic origin have dramatically higher rates of the disease and the complications that go along with its poor management, including cardiovascular dis ease, eye disease and limb amputation. In fact, it is estimated that one out of ev ery two Hispanic children born in 2000 will develop diabetes in adulthood. This is espec ially true in the South Bay communities in San Diego. Specifically, the city of C hula Vista is home to 26,000 Latinos with Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult onset or noninsulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes sugar (glucose), which is the body's main source of fuel. With Type 2 diabetes, the body either resists the effects of insulin - a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells - or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. If left untreated, Type 2 diabetes can be life threatening. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 58 diagnosed diabetes and tens of thousands more who are undiagnosed, have pre- diabetes and are at high risk of developing diabetes. Some alarming facts about Type 2 diabetes: About 1.7 million people aged 20 or older were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 2012 in the U.S. Diabetes is a major cause of hear t disease and stroke, and is the 7th leading cause of death in the Unit ed States and California. More than 1 out of 3 adults have prediabetes and 15 to 30% of those with prediabetes will develop Type 2 diabetes within 5 years. Some risk factors for developing diabetes include: Being overweight or obese Having a parent, brother or sister with diabetes. Smoking Having blood pressure measuring 140/90 or higher. Being physically inactive, exerci sing fewer than three times a week. Disparities and Diabetes: Hispanics and African Americans have tw o times higher prevalence: 1 in 20 non- Hispanic whites have Type 2 diabetes, compared with 1 in 10 Hispanics and 1 in 11 African Americans in 2011 - 2012. In San Diego, whites and blacks had the highest death rates due to diabetes in 2012. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is 13 percent higher in men than women in California. In San Diego, males had a higher deat h rate than females (22.5 per 100,000 versus 19.0 per 100,000 in 2012). The percent of adults in California with diabetes is almost two times higher in those with families incomes below 200 per cent of the federal poverty level compared to those whose income is 300 percent above. Adults with diabetes are more likely to have arthritis, hypertension and cardiovascular disease than adults without diabetes. Diabetes is a leading cause of lower lim b amputation and kidney failure in the United States. More than 7 million Americans are unaware that have diabetes. The complications related to diabetes are serious and can be reduced with preventive practices. Diabetes is a serious community health problem , leading to school and work absenteeism, 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 59 elevated hospitalization ra tes, frequent emergency room visits, permanent physical disabilities and sometimes death. During fiscal year 2016, Scripps s ponsored the following diabetes management initiatives: Project Dulce Project Dulce is a comprehensive, cultura lly sensitive diabetes management program for underserved and uninsured people in San Diego County. The program is team based and incorporates the chronic care model. Project Dulce has been active in communities across San Diego for the past 19 years, providing diabetes care and self-management education. Nurse led teams strive for measurable improvements in their pati ents' health, nurse educators lead multidisciplinary teams t hat provide clinical managem ent; and peer educators from each cultural group, known as Promotoras, provide public and patient education for their communities. This innovative program comb ines state of the art clinical diabetes management with proven educational and behavioral interventions. One of the primary co mponents of the program is recr uiting peer educators from the community to work directly with patients. These educators reflect the diverse population affected by diabetes and help teach other s about changing eating habits, adopting exercise routines and other ways to help manage this chronic disease. In fiscal year 2016, Project Dulce provided 5,970 diabetes care, retinal screenings and education visits for low income and underserved individuals throughout San Diego and enrolled 1,327 new Project Dulce patients. The program also in itiated four new projects, diabetes prevention for women with a history of gestational diabetes, replicating Project Dulce in Tijuana, diabetes care coordination at Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista and the diabetes gene bank program. Medical Assistant Health Coaching (MAC) Diabetes affects nearly 25 million individuals in the U.S., and if current trends continue, 1 of 3 adults will have diabetes by 2050. Diabetes self-management education and support (DSME) is a cornerstone of effective care that improves clinical control and health outcomes; however, DSME participat ion is low, particular among underserved populations, and ongoing support is often needed to maintain DSME gains. The complex needs of individuals with diabet es cannot be adequately addressed in the typical 15-minute primary care visit. Therefor e, the Scripps Whitti er Institute will be 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 60 studying the use of specially trained medical assistants as diabetes health coaches. By adopting a \"team-based\" approach that is informed by the Chronic Care Model, other primary care personnel [e.g., medical a ssistants (MAs] can be trained as health coaches to work in tandem with primary care providers to deliver self-management support. Diabetes Prevention The UCLA Center for Health Policy and Research recently published data that revealed nearly half of California adults have prediabetes or diabetes. While the Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute has been providing the be st care for people with diabetes for decades, this year the Institute kicked o ff the Scripps Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), which is a yearlong intervention wher e people with prediabetes meet weekly for 16 weeks, then monthly thereafte r. The primary objective is to lose 5 to 7% of body weight through healthy eating and physical ac tivity. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) has been thoroughly evaluated in NIH sponsored randomized controlled trials, and has been found to decrease the number of new cases of diabetes among those with prediabetes by 58%. Among people over age 60, there was a 71% reduction in new cases. In 2016, 63 patients attended 21 Sc ripps DPP orientation sessions. Much of the effort is focused in the South Bay for t he Latino population, whic h is at higher risk of getting diabetes than thei r white counterparts. Healthy Living Another prevention initiative of the Institute is Healthy Li ving, a series of 3 classes focused on promoting health behav iors that are directly re lated to the incidence of chronic disease, smoking, nutrition, and ph ysical activity. 675 people attended Healthy Living classes that were provided throughout the County, again with special attention to the Latino community of the South Bay. Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute P rofessional Education and Training Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute profession al education teams provide state of the art education and training for people who wish to increase their diabetes management knowledge and skills. With the rise in diabetes related devices, there is a great need to equip clinicians with the latest information and clinical skills. The Whittier's professional education program is led by a team of experts, including: endocrinologists, nurses, dieticians, Psychologists and other diabetes specialist. These individuals train practicing professionals to deliver the best possible care for their diabetes patients. Courses respond to the needs of allied health professionals seeking 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 61 to understand new and complex clinical treatment options for Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. Professional educati on was provided for 374 people on insulin management, incretin therapy, and diabetes di et and diabetes basics. Participants came from local health inst itutions and throughout the United States to learn from the Whittier Institute's most experienced diabetes experts. Over the last fiscal year, the Whittier Institute's profe ssional education depar tment provided four CME programs for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, midlevel provi ders and social workers and made numerous academic and research pres entations at professional association meetings. Retinal Screening Program It is estimated that every 24 hours, 55 people will lo se their vision as a result of diabetic retinopathy. With early diagnosis and appropri ate treatment, 95 percent of diabetic blindness could be prevented. For the past dec ade, the Scripps Diabetes Care Retinal Screening Program has provided low cost or free screenings to the community. Annually reaching about 500 individuals dire ctly and about 1,000 indirectly, the program identifies those at high risk for retinal damage and provides access to education, treatment and referrals. This innovative pr evention program has educated and saved the vision of thousands. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 62 Health Related Behaviors Health related behavior is one of the most important elements in people's health and well-being. Its importance has grown as sanitation has improved and medicine has advanced. Diseases that were once incurabl e can now be prevented or successfully treated. Health related behaviors, such as immunization, smoking cessation, improved nutrition, increased physical activity, oral health and injury prevention, have become important components of long term life. The risk factors for many chr onic diseases are well known. In particular, an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and substance abuse have need cited by the World Health Organization ( http://www.who.int/chp ) as important health behaviors that contribute to illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, canc er, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and others including mental disorders and oral diseases. Fruit/Vegetable Consumption: According to data from Cali fornia Health Interview Survey, 48.3% of children age 2 and older report ed consuming less than five servings of fruits and vegetables a day compared to 47.7% in California overall. Adults age 18 and over reported even less fruit and vegetable c onsumption. Approximat ely 70.5% of adults reported eating the recomm ended amount each day. Unhealthy eating habits are a significant contributing factor to future health issues including obesity and diabetes. Physical Inactivity: According to the CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promoti on, 14.9% of adults age 20 and older self-reported that they perform no leisure time physical activity. Higher rates of limited leisure time activity were reported at the state and national level (16.6% and 22.6% respectively). For youth results of the FITNESSGRAM physical fitness test show that 29.35% of children 5,7 and 9 ranked within the \"High Ri sk\" or \"Needs Improvement\" zo nes for aerobic capacity for the 2013 - 2014 year. The percentage of childr en that are not in the healthy fitness zone varies among ethnic groups with the lo west being non-Hispanic Asians at 20.6% and the highest being Hispanic or Latinos at 42.1%. Although this is smaller than the state average of 36.9%, it is still cause fo r concern and may lead to significant health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and poor cardiovascular health. Alcohol Consumption: The percentage of adults age 18 and older who self-report heavy alcohol consumption (defined as more t han two drinks per day on average for men and one drink per day on average for women) is 17. 2% in San Diego County according to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Syst em (BRFSS). Behaviors such as excessive alcohol consumption are detrimental to fu ture health and may illustrate or preclude 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 63 significant health issues, such as cirrhos is, cancer, and untreated mental and behavioral health needs. Tobacco Usage: The BFRSS also reports that 12.1% of adults age 18 and older self- reported currently smoking cigarettes some da ys or every day compare to 18.1% in the United States, adjusted for age. Tobacco use is linked to leading causes of death including cancer and cardiovascular disease. Understanding that personal behaviors play a si gnificant role in an individual's overall health status, Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness programs that help people take charge of their own, and their families,' health. During fiscal year 2016, Scripps sponsor ed a number of health behavior modification efforts: Community Programs and Clinical Serv ices of Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Community Benefits and Family Medici ne Residency Programs have delivered extensive value with superior outcomes. Community services combined reached 10,608 program patients and participants. There were mo re than 13,500 clinical visits provided by Scripps Family Medicine Residency. Community Based Health Improvement Activities Each month approximately 200 co mmunity members participate in classes, prevention lectures and support groups held at the We ll Being Center and No rman Park Senior Center. A total of 3,000 community member s have participated in classes and support groups. Youth Program Activities Scripps Chula Vista Community Benefits Services implement ed a wide variety of youth in health career activities including: Camp Scripps, mentoring programs, hospital tours, in- classroom presentations and surgery view ings. Scripps Family Medicine Residents also provide football game cove rage, sport injury clinics and physicals. A total of 3,726 youth participated in these programs. Senior Programs Each month a variety of seni or programs are held with local senior centers, churches, and senior housing. Some of these activiti es include: senior health chats and men's 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 64 group. More than 200 seniors participated in re sidency senior activities including group visits. Over 400 seniors parti cipated in these programs. Patient Community Services Services are offered directly to patients and their family post discharge to decrease the risks of readmission and to increase patient continuity. Support services are referral based and provide assistance with the following: housing/homelessness, senior issues, chronic disease issues, drug/alcohol and ment al health, cancer and more. This service is currently only available at the Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista campus. Since the start of the project in July 2014, 709 referrals have been received. Community Health Improvement Part ners (CHIP) and Resident Leadership Academy Model Scripps is a partner with CHIP and collabora tively works on a resident leadership model that has empowered 700+ citizens across the County (and beyond) to affect change in a wide range of community health areas such as public safety, access to healthy foods, and increased opportunities for physical activity. Ask a Nurse Public health nurses are available to pr ovide information to promote and encourage healthy choices that lead to better lives. The central public health nurses provide information to all participants at the City Heig hts Wellness Center on monthly topics that include asthma, heart health, seas onal health and ot her topics. Health Education and Support Groups Education and support groups are provided to San Diego County residents for a wide variety of health concerns. Topics include, Parkinson's disease, mental illness, postpartum issues, gynecological cancer , chronic pain and multiple sclerosis. Brain and Head Gear Protection Educational program for high school students to stress the im portance of bike safety. Brain injury protection thr ough the proper used of head gear. Prescription Take Back Day Scripps collaborates with the County of SD on the Prescription Drug Take Back Day which provides an opportunity for safe disposal of left over medications. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 65 Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease Dementia is a clinical syndrome of decline in memory and other thinking abilities. It is caused by various diseases and conditions that result in damage to brain cells and lead to distinct symptom patterns and distinguishing brain abnorma lities. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder t hat gradually destroys a person's memory and ability to learn, reason, make judgements, communicate and carry out daily activities such as bathing and eating. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States and 3rd leading cause of death in San Diego County. In 2013, an estimated 62,000 San Diegans age 55 years and older were living with Alzheimer's di sease and dementias (ADOD), accounting for 8.3% of the 55 years and ol der population. This populati on will roughly double in less than 20 years. In 2013, more than 20, 000 San Diegans age 55 and older were discharged from the emergency department (ED) or hospital with a mention of ADOD. Financial burden: In 2013 nearly 141,000 caregivers prov ided unpaid care for the 62,000 people living with ADOD in San Die go County. These caregivers provided nearly 161 million hours of unpaid care, valued at near ly $2 billion dollars. Due to the negative effects of caregiving on their own health, the cost of providing health care to these residents in 2013 was approximately $77.7 million dollars. Prevalence There are more than 5.2 million people in the United St ates living with ADOD. As the population ages the number is expected to triple by 2015. In California there are 588,208 people 55 years and older living with ADOD. One tenth of AD patients live in California. In San Diego County, the number of those 55 years and older with ADOD is expected to increase by 51% between 2012 and 2030, from 60,000 to nearly 94,000 residents. Currently, the East C ounty region has the greatest number (14,765) and proportion (12.4% ) of residents 55 years and older with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. The region with the larges t anticipated increase in ADOD in the North Central area, with a project ed increase of 76.8% from 2012 to 2030. However, it is estimated that by 2030, nearly one out of four San Diegans 55 years and older with ADOD will live in East County. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 66 During fiscal year 2016, Scripps engaged in the following Alzheimer's and dementia prevention and treatment activities: Senior Health and Well Being Programs The goal is to increase health care information and preventative services for seniors/older adults in the South Bay. Each m onth a variety of senior programs are held at local senior centers, churches and senior housing. Some of these activities included dementia, Alzheimer's and pain management, nutri tion and wellness and sponsorship of the Alzheimer's Association Caregiver Conf erence. More than 200 seniors participated in these activities. The Alzheimer's Project - San Di ego Unites for a Cure and Care The Alzheimer's Project is a countywide initia tive aimed at accelerating the search for a cure and helping the estimated 60,000 San Diegans with the disease, along with their caregivers. Participants began meeting in ea rly 2014 to craft a regional roadmap to address the disease, focusing on cure, ca re, clinical, and public awareness and education initiatives. The Board of Super visors approved the roadmap in December 2014 and later voted in support of an implement ation timetable. Dr . Michael Lobatz from Scripps Health is a leading participant of th is initiative as a Co-Chairperson of the Clinical Round Table and is a mem ber of the Steering Committee. Alzheimer's San Diego Program Support Alzheimer's San Diego offers a free half day event. Attendees learn the basics of Alzheimer's disease, how to partner with your doctor and get a diagnosis, and addressing behavior through compassionate co mmunication. Scripps donated $25,000 for program support. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 67 Obesity, Weight Status, Nutr ition, Activity and Fitness Obesity is an important health need due to its high prevalence in the U.S. and San Diego. Although it is not a leading cause of death, it is a significant contributor to the devel opment of other chronic conditions. Adults: 36.3% of adults aged 18 and older self- reported they have a BMI between 25.0 and 30.0 (overweight) in San Diego County according to 2011 - 2012 BRFSS data. An additional 20.1% of adults aged 20 years and ol der self-reported they have a BMI greater than 30. 0 (obese) in San Diego County. The percentage of residents who are obese was higher slightly among men (21.3%) than women (18.8%). Excess weight may indicate an unhealthy lifestyle and puts individuals at risk for further health issues including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and other health issues. Youth: FITNESSGRAM is t he required physical fitness test that school di stricts must administer to all California students in grades 5, 7 and 9. The percentage of children in grades 5, 7 and 9 ranking within the \" health risk\" category (overweight) for body com position on the FITNESSGRAM physical fitness test was 17.7% in San Diego County for the y ears 2013-2014. Furthermore, approximately 15.9% of children in grades 5, 7 and 9 were ranked within the \"high risk\" category (obese). Rates of overweight and obese y outh were highest among Hispanic/Latino and African American youth. Obesity is largely categorized as a secondar y diagnosis in hospital discharge data. An analysis of the primary diagnos es associated with a sec ondary diagnosis of an obesity related ICD-9 code in 2013 was used to provide an overview of the main reasons individuals with abnormal weight seek care by age group. In addition, local program data were summarized to provide additional perspective on the impact of obesity on morbidity in SDC. A summary of the trends found were as follows: When examining inpatient hospital disc harge data with obesity as a secondary diagnosis, it was found that the most common primary diagnosis of those Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health. Overweight and obesity ranges are determined using weight and height to calculate a number known as \"body mass index\" (BMI). For adults: BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. For children and adolescents (ages 2-19): BMI at or above the 85th percentile and lower than the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex is considered overweight BMI at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex is considered obese. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 68 patients were nonspecific chest pain in ages 25-64, abnormal pain for those ages 15-24, and those over 65 years their pr imary diagnosis wa s osteoarthritis, septicemia followed by congestive heart failure. Some facts about obesity in the United States: According to the 2013 BRFSS and YRBS S, 28.3% of the U.S. adults were obese, 35.5% of adults were overweight, 13.7% of adolescents were considered obese and 16.6% of adolescents were overweight. In 2013, 21.4% of adults reported in engag ing in no leisure time activity and the number of adults who report eating less than one vegetable or fruit daily is 17.3% and 30.4% respectively. Health consequences due to overweight and obesity: Research has shown that as weight increases to reach the levels of \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" the risks for the following conditions also increases: Coronary heart disease Type 2 diabetes Cancers (endometrial, breast and colon) Hypertension (high blood pressure) Stroke Liver and gallbladder disease Sleep apnea and respiratory problems Osteoarthritis Overweight and obesity associated costs: In 2008, medical costs associated with obesit y were estimated at $147 billion, the medical costs for people who are obese we re $1,429 higher than those of normal weight. Disparities and Obesity Obesity & Race According to the BRFSS, from 2012 through 2014, non-Hispanic blacks had the highest prevalence of self-reported obesit y (38.1%), followed by Hispanics (31.3%) and non-Hispani c whites (27.1%) In 2011 - 2012, the prevalence among children and adolescents was higher among Hispanics (22.4%) and non-Hispanics (20.2%) than am ong non-Hispanic whites (14.1%) 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 69 Obesity & Gender Among men, 42% were considered to be overweight com pared to 29% of women. The median percentage of obesit y was similar among men (28%) and women (27%) in the U.S. Obesity & Income Among non-Hispanic black and Mexic an American men, those with higher incomes are more likely to have obesity than those with low income. Higher income women and women with hi gher educational attainment are less likely to be obese than low income women. Obesity prevalence was the highest among children in families with an income to poverty ratio of 100% of less. Obesity & Quality of Life Obesity can affect the quality of life through limited m obility and decreased physical endurance, in addition to soci al, academic, and job discrimination. During fiscal year 2016, Scripps engaged in the following obes ity prevention and treatment activities: Community Health Improvement Project (CHIP) and Childhood Obesity Initiative The San Diego County Childhood Obes ity Initiative (The Initiative) is a private public partnership with the mission of reduci ng and preventing childhood obesity through policy, systems, and environment change. The Initiative is facilitated by Community Health Improvement Partners (C HIP). Core funding for The Initiative is provided by the County of San Diego, First 5 Commission of San Diego County, The California Endowment, and Kaiser-Permanente. Scripps is a strong partn er with CHIP and the outcomes of The Initiative have shown a decreased childhood obesity from 4% from 2005-2010, the largest drop in Southern Calif ornia (many areas have seen increases). Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) The Diabetes Prevention Program is a scientific ally validated lifestyle intervention based model. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) promote widespread adoption of the D PP due to is demonstrated effectiveness. Scripps aims to decrease the incidence of Type 2 diabetes by managing a major diabetes risk factor, obesity in the underserv ed, ethnically diverse populations by testing 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 70 the effectiveness of lifestyle curriculum. Sc ripps aims to examine the effectiveness of the DPP program in improving behavio ral and psychological risk profiles. Healthy Living Program Diabetes, heart disease, cancer and respirat ory disease are the four most prevalent serious chronic diseases in California. Thes e diseases cause 50 percent of all deaths in San Diego and throughout the U.S., and many people have more than one of these conditions. Because lifestyle can play a major role in preventing these chronic illnesses, Scripps introduced Healthy Living, a free, interact ive education program to help the San Diego community learn about and adopt practical ways to improve three behaviors - smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity - that contribute to these four diseases. Participants learn how to make healthy f ood choices using low costs options, make physical activity part of their daily life and learn how to stay motivated and maintain healthy habits. Scripps implements a series of three free sessions that encourage participants to identify and adopt practical ways to improve their health habits. Sessions are offered throughout San Diego County in English an d Spanish, with special emphasis on the Latino and underserved co mmunities. Sessions include health screening, healthy cooking tips, and mindful eat ing and practice sessions. Participants also receive a prediabetes screening; thos e who score high are then referred to the Scripps Diabetes Pr evention Program. Promise Neighborhood Initiative Scripps also addresses childhood obesity at the high school level in San Diego's South Bay communities through its partnership wit h the Promise Neighborhood initiative, which implements activities related to the national 5-2-1-0 campaign. Scripps partners with the Promise Neighborhood In itiative and Castle Park Elementary School to increase education and awar eness about healthy lifestyles for students, their parents and school staff. Promise Neighborhood dev eloped a Wellness Committee composed of the school principal, teachers, parents and Scripps staff aim ed to implement activities that support 5210: 5 fruits or more a day, 2 hours or less of scree n time, 1 hour of physical activity and 0 sugary juic es. The program encourages: eating 5 or more fruits a day, limiting TV screen time to 2 hours, 1 hour of daily physical activity, and drinking 0 sugar filled beverages. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 71 School administrators and staff are closely involved in the program, which includes five educational sessions, a health assessment surv ey and health plan, and support to help the students pass their yearly ph ysical education requirements. Since 2013, more than 400 children and 200 patients have participated in wellness activities on campus. As a result of ac tivities, lesson plans and advocacy for healthy living, the amount of physical activity and c onsumption of fruits and vegetables by children, parents and staff has increased. Ba sed on annual student surveys, 60 percent of students are more physically active, com pared to 26 percent in previous years. Let's Get Cooking In January 2014 The City Heights Wellness Cent er launched \"Let's Get Cooking\" , a hands on cooking class for moms, dads, caregive rs and their kids (ages eight and older) who want to learn simple, healthy recipes for the whole family. \"Let's Get Cooking\" aims to inspire families to eat fresh, nutritious , whole foods and to make healthy lifestyle choices through cooking, education and disc ussions. The classes are taught in both English and Spanish by bili ngual registered dieticians. In the Mid-City region of San Diego, there are currently no other hands on cooking/nutrition, education/obesity programs available. What se ts this program apart is bei ng able to offer the hands on cooking experience in a cert ified teaching kitchen. Ther e are currently nutrition education programs offered in the community. However, none of them is offering nutrition education through cooking. The t eaching kitchen provides not only a hands on learning experience, but more importantly a place for family interaction and building a sense of community. Super Chef Program and Camp Joint program of the CHWC and Leah's Pantry through a grant from General Mills, City Heights children and their parents move, co ok and learn to adopt healthier behaviors throughout the year by participating in F ood Smarts Workshops, a USDA/FNS approved cooking and nutrition education series. Three day summer camps are held for three age ranges of neighborhood children, and included a full hour of physical activity each day. Cooking and nutrition workshops teach the building blocks of a balanced diet, basic cooking and kitchen safety skills, develop individual nutrition goals, and spend time exercising. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 72 Vocational English Second Langu age Culinary Training Program The International Rescue Committee (IRC) in San Diego offers an innovative Vocational English as a Second Language (VESL) Plus pr ogram for refugees. These newly arriving refugees spend 32 hours a week, 8 weeks for Iraqi refugees or 16 weeks for Swahili and Karen Burmese speakers, learning valuabl e skills that will help them find and keep employment to support the economic health of their families. The program includes 60 hours of kitchen based training in a commercia l kitchen space that the CHWC provides. Nutrition Services and Physical Activity According to the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data for San Diego County, more than 63 percent of adults are over weight or obese. Obesity increases the risk for heart disease, Type 2 Diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke and some forms of cancer. The nation's low in come, minority populations are at an even greater risk In an effort to address this critical health concern, staff member s at the City Heights Wellness Center has established a variety of nutrition education programs to meet the needs of low income, minority populations . A unique aspect of the City Heights Wellness Center (CHWC) is the Teaching Kitchen. The kitchen is known throughout the community as a place where residents and pr oviders come together to cook, discover and communicate in a safe and trusted environment. The Teaching Kitchen serves as an interactive, hands on environment for partici pants of all ages to learn how to plan and prepare food in a health manner. Throughout the year, a variety of nutrition related activities ar e offered at no or low cost, including meal planning, food budgeti ng and selection, cooking classes and demonstrations, dietary counseling and physi cal activities. City Heights Wellness Center's trainings, classes and programs for t he community to prevent chronic diseases served 6,876 participants. Note: Data was only reported for six months as there was a change in leadership at the Center, and thus a transition per iod with a decrease in service as a result. In addition to general nutrition education, more spec ialized services offered include: Family Nutrition Programs Physical Activity Programs/Dance/Exercise Infant and Child Nutrition Food Safety Breastfeeding Education and Support Diabetes Education and Management 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 73 The Center uses a combination of approac hes to address a broad array of community health priorities, including nutrition, a ccess to services and community engagement. The goal is to prevent disease by st rengthening community partnerships and link existing services to provide City Heights' residents with opportunities to become more involved in managing their own health. The Center has earned a reputation for being (1 ) a safe place to come and seek help for a variety of health and social needs; (2 ) a resource for obtaining easy access to information about health and community resources, (3) a flexible meeting place that has the capacity to bring people together around co mmunity health issues, especially food and nutrition.

Since its inception in 2002, the City Heights Wellness Center has been a dynamic, community based program developed by Scripps Mercy Hospital and Rady Children's Hospital, working with residents to improve their lifestyle behaviors and self-sufficiency skills. Multiple not-for-profit and government al organizations, philanthropic foundations and grassroots groups have joined the e ffort conducting health promotion and educational activities for community resi dents. A unique aspect of the City Heights Wellness Center is the Teaching Kitchen that is known throughout the community as a place where residents and providers come t ogether to cook, discover and communicate in a safe and trusted environment. La Maestra Family Clinic will br ing a new perspective to the partnership as a community health center and primary care provider serv ing the culturally di verse populations within the City Heights community. La Maestra is co mmitted to maintainin g the collaborative nature of the partnership, and will continue to work with current CHWC agencies as well as look for opportunities to ex pand health promotion services. The Scripps Mercy Supplement al Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), collocated in the Wellness Center, w ill continue to provide WIC services as one program within the City He ights Wellness Center. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 74 Collaborative for Healthy Weight This advisory group meets monthl y. Collaborate for Healthy We ight is a program of the Health Resources and Services Administrati on (HRSA) and the National Initiative for Children's Healthcare Quality (NICHQ). T he shared vision is to create partnerships between primary care, public health, and community organizations to discover sustainable ways to promote healthy wei ght and eliminate health disparities in communities across the United States. All thr ee sector must collaborate, using evidence based approaches, to reverse the obesity epi demic and improve the health of our communities, 120 member. Several manu scripts are under development. Maternal Child Health & High Risk Pregnancy Mothers, infants and children makeup a large segment of t he U.S. population and their well-being is a health predictor for the nex t generation. There is tremendous focus on maternal illness and death, and infant health and survival, including infant mortality rates, access to preventative care, and fetal, perinatal and other infant deaths. Maternal and infant health issues include: Alcohol, tobacco and illegal substances during pregnancy, which are major risk factors for low birth wei ght and other poor outcomes. Very low birth weight associated with preterm birth, spon taneous abortion, low pre-pregnancy weight and smoking. Infant death rates are highest among infants born to young teenagers and mothers 44 years and older. Being pregnant, or trying to become pregnant, is only a small portion of a woman's life. Unintended pregnancy, either mi stimed or unwanted at the time of conception, accounts for an estimated 49 percent of pregnancie s in the U.S. These pregnancies are associated with increased morb idity, as well as behaviors linked to adverse health. Women who can plan the number and timing of their children experience improved health, fewer unplanned pregnancies and births, and lower abortion rates. High Risk Pregnancy High Risk Pregnancy can be the result of a medical condition present before pregnancy or a medical condition that develops dur ing pregnancy for either mom or baby and causes the pregnancy to become high risk. A high risk pregnancy can pose problems before, during or after deliv ery and might require special monitoring throughout the pregnancy. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 75 Risk factors: Advanced maternal age: increased ri sk for mother's 35 years and older. Lifestyle choices: smoking, alcoho l consumption, use of illegal drugs. Medical history: prior high risk pregnancie s or deliveries, fetal genetic conditions, family history of genetic conditions. Underlying conditions: diabetes, high blood pressure and epilepsy. Multiple pregnancy. Obesity during pregnancy. There were 43,627 live births in SDC overall in 2013 and the fetal mo rtality in SDC was 4.56 deaths, meeting the HP 202 0 national targets for all maternal and infant health indicators including the target of less than 5.6 fetal deaths per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths. Maternal and Infant Health Indicators by SDC Region, 2013 SDC regions met all HP 2020 national targets in 2013. In 2013, fetal mortality was 4.5 fetal deaths per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths in the North Coastal region, 4.3 in the North Central region, 5.7 in the Central region , 3.1 in the South region, 5.6 in the East region, and 4.1 in t he North Inland region.

Note: Infant mortality rates are per 1,000 live births. Fetal mortality rates are per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths. Scripps Health continued to enhance prenatal education for low income women in San Diego County in fiscal year 2016. The following are some examples: Community Benefit Services Offered more than 1,000 maternal child health classes throughout San Diego County to enhance parenting skills. Low income women in San Diego who were eligible attended classes at no ch arge or on a sliding fee schedule. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 76 Maintained existing prenatal education se rvices in all regions of the county, ensuring that programs cont inued to demonstrate a sati sfaction rating above 90 percent Provided and supported w eekly breastfeeding support gr oups at seven locations throughout San Diego County, includi ng two with bilingual services. Offered maternal child health classes throughout the community, such as Basic Training for Dads, Getting Ready for t he Baby, Infant CPR and Safety, Parent Connection programs and Redire cting Children's Behavior. Offered the Dogs and Babies programs quar terly, with more than 40 attendees. Offered weekly Mommy and Me Yoga programs for new parents. Offered a prenatal yoga program for ex pectant women in San Diego County. Offered a pregnancy nutrition program quarterl y at Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla. Offered classes in pelvic floor and pr egnancy changes for expectant families at Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla. Offered classes in pelvic floor and postpartum changes for new mothers throughout the community. First 5 and Promise Neighborhood More than 350 services were received for fi rst time mothers including: home visits, referrals received, data entry, follow up phone calls, patenting classes and other support services. A total of 231 parents partici pated in parenting classes, 213 sessions provided. Scripps Mercy's Supplemental Nutriti on Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Scripps Mercy Hospital is one of five regi onal organizations that administer the state funded WIC program. The program serves six locations conveniently situated near community clinics and/or hospitals in t he central San Diego area. WIC targets low income pregnant and postpartum women, inf ants and children (ages 0 to 5 years). Scripps Mercy WIC serves approximat ely 7,500 women and children annually, 44 percent in the City Heights community. In City Heights clients are 91 percent Hispanic and include pregnant and postpartum women (24%), infants (20%) and children (56%). In fiscal year 2016, the program provided nutrition services, counselin g and food vouchers for 80,049 women and 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 77 children in south and central San Diego. Th e Scripps Mercy WIC program plays a key role in maternity care by reaching low income women to promote prenatal care, good nutrition and breastfeeding during pregnancy and offer lactation support (one on one and group), as well as supplies, pumps and br east pads, during the postpartum period. City Heights East African Alliance Health Advocacy Project The City Heights Wellness Center Health Advo cacy Project is support by a grant from The California Endowment Foundation and is designed to strengthen the capacity to deliver culturally and religiously competent health promotion services to Somali and East African women and their families. The program addresses unmet needs like prenatal outreach and education, culturally adapted nutriti on and fitness education, breastfeeding education, early childhood health, and nutrition and safety classes. Centering Pregnancy, Scripps Fa mily Medicine Residency Raising healthy families and caring for t he next generation of San Diegans before they're born help create a healthier community for years to come. The Scripps Family Medicine Program at Scripps Mercy Hospit al Chula Vista, is providing access, education and clinical services to nearly 200 pregnant women in south San Diego County. The goal of the progr am, \"Improving Perinatal Ca re for Underserved Latina Women - Healthy Women, Healthy Babies\", is to provide access to perinatal care for underserved Latina women in order to improv e birth outcomes. The program applies the principles of the Center Health Care In stitute and focuses on c hanging the way patients experience their care through assessmen t, education and group support. Centering Pregnancy is the institute's model devoted specifically to im proving maternal and child health, and has been shown to result in incr eased prenatal visits, greater levels of breastfeeding and stronger relationships between mothers and their healthcare providers before, during and after pregnancy. The results are promising. Women who gave birth reported an enhanced prenatal ex perience, gained less weight throughout their pregnancy and showed improved health care knowledge. As the program continues, patient navigator s will follow-up with participant s to gauge other important factors and help them mainta in healthy lifestyles. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 78 Unintentional Injury and Violence Unintentional injuries occur at home, at work, while participating in sports and recreation, on the streets and at school and are associated with motor vehicle accidents, falls, firearms, fire /burns, drowning, poisoning (i ncluding drugs and caustic substances), alcohol, gas, cleaners and many other causes. The deaths associated with unintentional injuri es are significant, yet represent only a small part of a much larger public health problem. Hospitalization data is a better measure of the injury problem than the death data alone. Un intentional injuries, motor vehicle accidents, falls, pedestrian related, fi rearms, fire/burns, drowning, explosion, poisoning (including drugs and alcohol, gas, cleaners and caustic substances) choking/suffocation, cut/pierce, exposure to electric current/radiation/fire/smoke, natural disasters and injuries at work, are one of th e leading causes of death for SDC residents of all ages, regardless of gender, race or region. Most events resulting in inju ry, disability or death are predictable and preventable. There are many risk factors for unintentiona l injury and violence, including individual behaviors and choices, such as alcohol use or risk taking; the physical environment both at home and in the community; access to health services and systems created for injury related care; the social environmen t, including individual social experiences. According to the California Department of Public Health's, Burden of Chronic Disease and Injury Report: California, 2013 injuries, incl uding both intentional and unintentional, is the number one killer and disa bler of person's ages 1 to 44 years in California. The same report states that every year in California, injuries, cause more than 16,000 deaths, 75,000 cases of disability, 240,000 hospi talizations, and 2.3 million ED visits. Between 2010 and 2013, nearly 4, 000 San Diegans died as a result of unintentional injuries. The region's age-adjusted death rate due to unintentional injuries was 37.4 deaths per 100,000 population, the highest of all regions in SDC and above the SDC age-adjusted rate of 30.6 deaths per 100, 000 population. In 2013, there were 3,995 hospitalizations related to unintentional inju ry in SDC's east region. The age-adjusted rate of hospitalizations was 785 per 100,000 population, which is above the county age- adjusted average of 691. 5 per 100,000 population. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 79 Scripps Health continues to address unintent ional injury and violence in fiscal year 2016. The following are some examples: AARP Driver Safety Program An eight hour driver impr ovement course especially des igned for motorists age 50 and older. The course helps drivers refine existi ng skills and develop safe, defensive driving techniques. Open to AARP members and non-members alike. Aging Summit Expo Scripps provided education regarding Home Safety, Fall Prevention and Medication Safety. Fall Prevention and Home Safety Scripps Social Worker and RN lecture on wa ys to reduce fall risk, improve safety awareness and utilize available resources to promote independence and overall safety. San Diego Brain Injury Foundatio n Provide quality of life impr ovements for brain injury survivors and support to family members. Scripps Memorial Hospital Enci nitas donates space to this organization for meetings. Every 15 Minutes Alcohol can be attributed to more than 100, 000 deaths in the U.S. annually, including 41% of all traffic fatalities. The Every 15 Minutes program in a two-day immersion experience for teens on the realistic cons equences of drinking and driving, which involves the schools, law enforcement, c ourts, emergency service providers, and the mortuary. The \"injured\" st udents are taken to Scripps Mercy Trauma Center. This program is sponsored jointly by local hi gh schools, county police and sheriff's departments, ambulance services , and emergency departments. Beach Area Community Court Program The program is an educational pr ogram for first time offenders for quality of life crimes. This is a collaboration with the San Di ego Police Department, Parks and Recreation, District Attorney's Office and Discover Pacifi c Beach. Education is provided to the participants regarding these qualit y of life crimes and their e ffects on the community, the effects of smoking and alc ohol consumption and the rules and regulations for the beach community. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 80 Car Seat Check Scripps provides a safety assessment of the in stallation of a child's care seat. Offered at no cost to low/median income and refugee families. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 81 Behavioral Health Behavioral health is an impor tant health need because it impacts an individual's overa ll health status and is a comorbidity often associated with multiple chronic conditions, such as diabetes, obesity and asthma. Behavioral health encompasses many different area s including m ental health, mental illness and substance abuse. Because of its broadness, it is often difficu lt to capture the need for behavioral health services with a single measure. An analysis of mortality data in San Diego County found that in 2012, Alzheimer's disease was the third leading cause of death and intentional self-harm (suicide) was the eighth. Hospital emergency department encounters and inpatient discharge data for patients wi th a primary diagnosis of behavioral health-associated ICD 9 code in 2013 was used to provide an overview of main reasons individuals sought care related to behavioral health by age group. A summary of the trends found were as follows: OSHPD ED discharge data: Anxiety diso rders were the top primary diagnosis for ED discharge among those aged 5 through 44 and those 65 and older. For those aged 45-64, the top ED discharge for behavioral health was alcohol-related disorder followed by anxiety and mood di sorders. Alcohol related disorders was the number two primary diagnosis for discharge for those aged 15 through 44 and those 65 years and older. OSHPD inpatient discharge data revealed that when examining the ICD 9 codes related to behavioral health, 'mood disorder s' was the top primary diagnosis for inpatient discharge for ages 5 through 24 and 45 and over. For those aged 25 through 44, the top behavioral health primary diagnosis was 'schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders' fo llowed by mood disorders. Feedback from the behavioral health discussions in the 2016 CHNA found that high rates of psychotic discharges in ages 25 to 44 were likely linked to underlying substance abuse problems. Although participants agreed with the findings, it was found that hospital c oding may potentially underrepresent the prevalence of underlying issues and miss certain conditions. Most notably missing from OSHPD data was developmen tal disorders. The groups also Mental Health can be defined as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease\". Mental illness is defined as \"collectively all diagnosable mental disorders\" or \"health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning\". 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 82 pointed out the importance of emerging dat a trends. In recent years, discussion participants cited a significant increase in drug-related discharges, particularly methamphetamine (~over 100%). In the 2016 CHNA mental health issues and alcohol/drug abuse issues were consistently selected by the highest number of HHSA survey participants in all regions as health problems that have the greates t impact on overall community health. In addition, aging concerns including Alzheime r's disease was cited among the top five most important health needs in all regions in SDC except the central region. The following categories were found to be import ant health needs with behavioral health in SDC: Alzheimer's disease (seniors) Anxiety (all age groups) Drug and alcohol issues (teens and adults) Mood disorders (all age groups) Anxiety: Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress but can become excessive, difficult to control, and ultimately interfere with normal day-to-day living. Ther e are wide variety of anxiety disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder. National prevalence data estimates that 18% of the population had an anxiety disorder, with phobias and generalized anxiety being the most common. In San Diego County, there has been a steady increase in the rate of ED discharges with a primary diagnosi s of anxiety. In particular, there has been a 64.2% increas e in children up to age 14 from 25 per 100,000 in 2010 to 41 per 100,000 in 2013. Substance Abuse: The Substance Abuse and Mental H ealth Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines substance use disorders as the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs which causes clinically and functional ly significant impairme nt, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet majo r responsibilities at work, school, or home. The percentage of adults aged 18 and older in San Diego County who self-report heavy alcohol consumption (defined as more t han two drinks per day on average for men and one drink per day on average for women) is 17.2%, additionally, 12.1% reported currently smoking cigarettes some days or everyday according to the BRFSS. Acute substance abuse hospitalization rate s increased 37.4% from 2010 to 2013 and increased most among 15-24 year olds (58%). 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 83 Acute alcohol hospitalization rates grew most among 25-44 year olds with a 45.9% increase between 2010 and 2013. Finally, chroni c alcohol ED visits among seniors aged 65 and older increased 89.7% during the same period. Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia although all dementias are characterized by a decline in memory, thinking skills, and ability to perform everyday activities. According to the 2015 San Diego County Senior Health Report, roughly 60,000 individuals in San Di ego are living with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia (ADOD) in 2012. It is proj ected that the number of San Diego adults aged 55 and older with ADOD will increas e by 55.9% between 2012 and 2030. The largest majority of individuals live in t he East region though the largest percentage is projected in the North Central. ADOD also affects caregivers physically and emotionally so significant increases in the number of people living with ADOD will have an impact that extends beyond those affected. Mood disorders: Mood disorders are particularly prevalent in the community and increasing. Data from the C enters for Medicare and Medica id show that among the fee- for-service population, 14.5% su ffer from depression compared to 13.4% in California in 2012. In addition, an analysis of OSHPD data s hows that the rate of ED discharges per 100,000 individuals with a primary diagnosis of mood disorders increased by 38.7% from 2010 to 2013 for children up to age 14, hospitalizations also went up by 26.8% in this age group. Mood disorders are often as sociated with comorbidities including diabetes, obesity and asthma. Suicide is also an indicator of poor mental health and is one of the major complications of depression. In San Diego County, the suicide rate according to the California Department of Public Health is 11. 3 per 100,000 population which is above the state suicide ra te of 9.8 per 100,000 and above the HP2020 benchmark of 10.2 per 100,000 populat ion. It is also the ei ghth leading cause of death in San Diego County. When adjusting for race /ethnicity, non-Hispanic whites are more likely to commit suicide followed by Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders. Comparing suicide rates by race, non-Hispanic, black, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, and those of multiple races were all above state levels. Mental and Behavior health co vers a broad range of topics: Substance abuse and misuse are one set of behavioral health problems. Others include (but not limited to) serious psyc hological distress, suicide, and mental illness. Barriers can exist for patients across the lifespan. The National Survey for Children's Health (HRSA, 2010) showed that among children with emotional, 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 84 developmental, or behavioral conditions , 45.6% were receiving needed mental health services. In 2014, among the 20.2 milli on adults with a past year substance use disorder, 7.9 million (39.1%) had any ment al illness in the past year. Depression: Depression is the leading cause of disabili ty worldwide and is a major contributor of global burden of disease. In 2014, 11.4% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 had a major depressive episode. The percentage who used illicit drugs in the past year was higher among those with a past year major depressive episo de (MDE) than it was among those without a past year MDE (33% vs. 15.2%). Prevalence: In 2014, an estimated 43.6 million (r oughly 18%) adults aged 18 or older had any mental illness in the United States. One-half of all chronic mental illness begi ns by the age of 14; three quarters by the age of 24. Disparities and Behavioral Health: Behavioral Health & Race Compared with Whites, African Americ ans and Hispanic Americans used mental health services at about one-half the rate in 2010. Black adults and adolescents were less lik ely than their white counterparts to receive treatment for depression. American Indian/Alaskan Native adults and those of two or more races had the highest prevalence of mental illness with 26% and 28% living with a mental health condition, respectively. Behavioral Health & Housing An estimated 26% of homeless adults stay ing in shelters live with serious mental illness and an estimated 46% live with seve re mental illness and/or substance use disorders. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 85 Behavioral Health & Gender Males commit suicide four times more than females. Adult males were less likely than adul t females to receive treatment for depression. Behavioral Health & Sexuality LGBTQ individuals are two or more times likely as strai ght individuals to have a mental health condition. Behavioral Health & Chronic Disease Mental illness is associated with chr onic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Suicide and Suicide Attempts Suicide is a major complication of depressi on and a leading cause of non-natural death for all ages in San Diego County, second onl y to motor vehicle accidents. While the U.S. and California struggle with rising suic ide rates, the 2015 San Diego County (SDC) data revealed that SDC is holding its gr ound on progress made last year. Compared to 2014, when the suicide rate declined for the first time in recent history, the suicide rate in 2015 held steady at 13.2 per 100,000 popul ation. Gains in help-seeking among San Diegans are also staying the course. Crisis calls to the local Access & Crisis hotline rose 1% in 2015 on top of the 15% increase in 2014.

Population Data from SANDAG 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 86 In 2010, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) launched a suicide prevention planning proc ess, which was formed by the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and the Califor nia Strategic Plan on Suicide Prevention. Scripps is a member of the Community H ealth Improvement Part ners (CHIP), which collaborates with the count y on this initiative. The behavioral health program at Scripps Me rcy also supports community programs to reduce the stigma of mental illness and help affected individuals live and work in the community. Scripps Health Behavioral Health Inpatient Programs Individuals suffering from acute psychiatr ic disorders are sometimes unable to live independently or may even pose a danger to t hemselves or others. In such cases, hospitalization may be the most appropriate al ternative. The Behavioral Health Inpatient Program at Scripps Mercy Hospital helps patients and their loved ones work through short-term crises, man age mental illness and resume their daily lives. Challenges Like many behavioral health programs acro ss the country, funding is difficult, as payment rates have not kept pace with the cost to provide care. In 2016, the Scripps Mercy Behaviora l Health Program experienced a $2.9 million loss in operations. In 2016, 1.9 percent of patients in the inpatient unit were uninsured. Behavioral Health Outpatient Programs Scripps Behavioral Health entered into an agreement in May 2016 to transition the intensive behavioral health out patient program to the Fam ily Health Centers of San Diego and expand outpatient behavioral healt h offerings to the population served. Scripps Mercy and Family Health C enters Behavioral H ealth Partnership Scripps Mercy has established an initiative with Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) to create a more robust behavioral health care system for Medi-Cal patients that receive care at SMH. The goal is to strengthen the continuum of integrated primary and mental health services for patients discharged from various hospital settings (medical and behavioral health inpatient an d emergency care) through a variety of timely patient engagement strategies in cluding the expansion of community-based behavioral health services adjacent to the hos pital. The ultimate goal is to involve 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 87 patients in appropriate outpatient care bef ore their behavioral health issues become acute so they do not return to the Emergency Department. Mental Health Outreach Services, A- Visons Vocational Training Program Behavioral Health Services at Scripps Merc y Hospital, in partnership with the San Diego chapter of Mental Health of America established the A-Vi sons Vocational Training Program (social rehabi litation and prevocational servic es for people living with mental illness) to help decrease the stigma of mental illness and offer volunteer and employment opportunities to persons with ment al illness. This supportive employment program provides vocational training for people receiving mental health treatment, potentially leading to greater independence. Th is year, Behavioral Health Services continued participating in the A-Visions program. Since its inception, 484 cli ents have been enrolled and 91 hav e been Scripps volunteers and 46 have been employed at Scripps Health. Cu rrently, there are a total of 29 active candidates, 25 employees and four voluntee rs participating in this supportive employment program. A-Visi ons participants have been empl oyed on a casual/per diem basis by Scripps Environmental Services, Food Services and clerical support for Health and Information Services, Emergency Servic es, Nursing Research, Human Resources and Palliative Care Services. Paid A-Visions c andidates typically limit their work to eight hours per week, which allows t hem to maintain eligibility for the disability benefits, medications and ongoing behavioral health care that supports their work. Increasing Awareness of Mental Health Issues In fiscal year 2016, Scripps Behavioral Heal th Services improved awareness of mental health issues by providing information and supportive services for more than 1,000 people at community events. Community Health Improvement Part ners (CHIP) and Suicide Prevention Council Scripps is a strong partner of CHIP. CHIP trained approximately 8,000 community members in suicide prevention to help address rising rates of suicide in the county. Psychiatric Liaison Team (PLT) The Psychiatric Liaison Team is a mobile psychiatric assessment team. Clinicians provide mental health evaluation and triage se rvices to accurately assess patients and provide them with best and safest community resources to prom ote ongoing care. The 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 88 team aims to help people adher e to treatment plans, reduce hospital readmission rates, relieve symptoms and ultimately ensure the long-term stabilization of the patient's mental health. Scripps will cont inue to provide a dedicated P sychiatric Liaison Team at all Scripps Hospitals Emergency Depar tments and urgent care settings (Rancho Bernardo and Torrey Pines). Scripps Drug and Alcohol Resources Nurses Scripps has implemented the role of a mobile group of specially trained drug and alcohol resource nurses that provide educat ion, interventions and discharge placement assistance to patients in the Scripps hospita ls. The resource nurses work directly with the nursing staff at each of the hospitals in search of patients who may be at risk for alcohol/drug withdrawal and assist with implementing a standardized protocol withdrawal process. Through a contract with Volunteers of America (VOA), the Scripps resource nurse in collaboration with case management is able to offer a limited number patients in need of detox residential placemen t at the VOA facility in National City. Mi Puente/My Bridge-Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Individuals of low socioeconomic (SES) and ethnic minority st atus, including Hispanics, the largest U.S. ethnic mi nority group are disproportiona tely burdened by chronic cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (\"c ardiometabolic\" e.g. obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease). High levels of unmet behavioral health in this population contribute to striking disparities in diseas e prevalence and outcomes. Mi Puente applies a RN plus volunteer approach, and builds upon a strong collaborative partnership between inpatient (\"referring\") and outpatie nt (\"receiving\") care settings. Mi Puente aims to improve continuity of care and address the (physical and behavioral) health needs of the at-risk Hispanic populati on. This program holds promise for impactful expansion to other condi tions and underserved populations. Behavioral Health Integratio n Program (BHIP) in Diabetes Behavioral Health Integration Program (BHIP) in Diabetes is an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to managing the emotional and behavioral needs of individuals with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.

A nalysis of results from the community partner discussions and key Info rmant interviews revealed the most commonly associated social determinants of health for each of the top health needs. The top ten social determinants were cons istently referenced across the different community engagement activities, food insecuri ty & access to healthy food, access to care or services, homeless/housing issues , physical activity, education/knowledge, cultural competency, trans portation, insurance issues, stigma and poverty. The importance of these social det erminants was also confirmed by quantitative data. Below are programs and organizations that Scripps supports that are addressing social determinants of health. Scripps Mercy Hospital has established a partnership at the City Heights Wellness Center (CHWC) with La Maestr a Family Clinic and Rady Ch ildren's Hospital to address some of the attributing factor s to poor health status for loca l residents. With La Maestra serving as the lead agency, Scripps Mer cy and Rady Children's are contributing resources to support operational costs of the Center in order to provide capacity for need community linkages. Some of these include: Integrative Health Night The Alternative Healing Network offers bimonthly community clinics which bring together and promotes the uses of integrative healing arts and improves access to 'alternative' health care in under-served neighborhoods. Services include acupuncture, chiropractic, naturalistic medicine and clinical massage. Scripps Health provides in-kind space at the City Heights Wellness Center to hold these meetings. International Rescue Committee (IRC) The International Rescue Committee (IRC) in San Diego offers an innovative Vocational English as a Second Language (VESL) Plus program for refugees. The program includes 60 hours of kitchen based training in a commercial kitchen space that the City Heights Wellness Ce nter provides. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 92 Food Insecurity Food insecurity was prioritized as the number one social determinants of health in the 2016 CHNA. Food insecurity is the inability to afford enough food for an active, healthy life. One in six San Diegans are \"food insecure\". An estimated 485,521 San Diego County residents, or 15.7 per cent of the county' s population, do not have enough food for an active, healthy life.3 The programs highlighted below are ways that Scripps Health is addressing food insecurity. The CalFresh Program, federally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), issues monthly electronic benefits that can be used to buy foods at participating markets and stor es. More than 290,000 San Di egans receive CalFresh. Studies demonstrate that hunger significantly impacts heal th. Lack of access to healthy food, often due to availability and cost, are st ressors that contribute to diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other behavioral health issues in a myriad of ways: Food Insure adults with diabetes have higher average blood sugars. Food Insure adults are more likely to be obese. Food Insecurity is significantly more prevalent in adults with mood disorders. Food Insecurity is associated with increased risk of suicidal thoughts and substance abuse in adolescents. Food Insecure seniors have a signific antly higher likelihood of heart disease, depression and limited activi ties of daily living. Food Insecure adults delay buying food in order to purchase medications. The City Heights Wellness Center (CHWC) Hosts Eligibility Workers from La Maestra Family Clinic are available to counsel people and assist filling out applications for F ood Stamp Assistance. CHWC not only provides the needed space for the activity, but also ac tively participates by developing outreach flyers, scheduling community residents, and overall coordination for the class.

Without the ability to train and inspire a new generation of health care providers, or to offer continuing educati on to existing health care professionals, the quality of health care will be greatly dimi nished. Medical research also plays an important role in improving the community 's overall health by developing new and innovative treatments. Each year, Scripps allocates resources to ad vance health care services through clinical research, medical education and health pr ofessional education. During Fiscal Year 2016 (October 2015 to September 2016), Scripps invested $24,201,8571 in professional training programs and clinical research to enhance service delivery and treatment practices in San Diego County. This secti on highlights some of our professional education and health research activities.

These programs are designed to raise public awareness and understanding of, and access to, identified community health needs (refer to Section 2 - Community Health Needs Assessment). During fiscal year 2016 (October 2015 to September 2016) Scripps Green Hospital invested $198,262 in community health serv ices. This figure reflects the costs associated with providing community health im provement activities, including salaries, materials and supplies, minus billable revenue. This section highlights some of Scripps Green Hospital's fiscal year 2016 communi ty health services achievements. Professional Education and Health Research Highlights Quality health care is highly dependent upon health edu cation systems and medical research programs. Without the ability to train and inspire a new generation of health care providers, or offer continuing education to existing health care professionals, the quality of health care would be greatly dimi nished. Medical research also plays an important role in improving the community 's overall health by developing new and innovative treatments options. Each year, Scripps Green Hospital allocates resources to advance health care services through professional educati on programs. To enhance service delivery and treatment practices for San Diego County; Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas invested $5,208,5582 in professional training and health re search programs during fiscal year 2016 (October 2015 to September 2016).

(October 2015 to September 2016). Making a Financial Commitment During fiscal year 2016, Scripps Whitti er Diabetes Institute devoted $123,259 to community benefit programs, including uncompensated health care, community health services, professional education and health re search. The programs offered by Scripps Whittier emphasize community based preven tion efforts and use innovative approaches to reach residents at greater risk for health problems. Over the past eleven years; the diabetes ep idemic has permeated every facet of our community. The percentage of individuals ente ring hospitals with diabetes is rising, the number of children developing diabetes is growing, and la rger number of people are experiencing complications from diabetes, such as renal failure and heart disease, at an earlier age. Developing unique innovative clinical programs and community-based research is urgently needed to combat th is epidemic. The diabetes and obesity epidemic have a disproportionate impact on low- income ethnic groups, yet there is little research demonstrating clinically and cost-effe ctive care and treatment models for these highest risk populations. Diabetes leads to school and work absenteeism, elevated hospitalization rates, frequent emergency room visits, permanent physical disabilities and sometimes death. There are 29 million people with diabetes in the United Stat es and 382 million worldwide, and rates are highest in divers e racial and ethnic communities and low- income populations. Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions, and people of Hispanic origin have dramatically higher rate s of the disease and t he complications that go along with its poor management, including card iovascular disease, eye disease and limb amputation. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 190 Diabetes is a major cause of hear t disease and stroke, and is the 7th leading cause of death in the United States and Ca lifornia. More than 1 out of 3 adults have prediabetes and 15-30% of those with prediabetes will develop Type 2 diabetes within 5 years. This is especially true in the South Bay communities in San Diego. Specifically, the city of Chula Vista is home to 26,000 Latinos with diagnosed diabetes and thousands more who are undiagnosed, have pre-diabet es and at high risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes is an important health need because of its prevalence, its impact on morbidity and mortality, and its preventability. An analysi s of mortality data for San Diego County found that in 2012 'Diabetes me llitus' was the seventh leading case use of death. The percentage of adults aged 20 and older who have been diagnosed with diabetes was 7.2 in 2012 in San Diego County and has been steadily rising since 2005 according to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Type 2 diabetes is an important target for intervent ion because hospitalizations due to diabetes- related complications are potentially preventable with proper management and a healthy lifestyle. In San Diego, approximately 1.5% of discharges in the black patient population were attributable to diabetes compared to 09.7% of discharges among whites. Project Dulce Model 18 Years of Experience The key element for the Proj ect Dulce are Multidiscipli nary Team Approach (Nurse - led), Peer Education (Promotoras) and Em powered Patients. This model has improved clinical outcomes for glucose, blood pre ssure and LDL-C. It has improved behavior outcomes and patient satisfaction. Lowered costs to the health system through fewer ER visits and hospitalizations. Over 25,000 indivi duals have been treated.1 1 Philis-Tsimikas A, et al.

Scripps Cancer Care Founded in 1999, Scripps Cancer Care (S CC) ensures the coordinated delivery of oncology services throughout the Scripps syst em. Scripps is a nationally recognized leader in cancer therapy, prov iding treatments at its five hospital campuses, radiation therapy centers and various Scripps Clinic locations. Scripps cancer physicians and staff work collaboratively toward cancer prevention, early detection, coordinated treatment and community support services. Scripps Cancer Care is actively involved in leading-edge clinical, translation al and basic research. It is accredited as an integrated network program by the American Coll ege of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer, a distinction that demonstrates consistency in providing the highest quality of patient care. Scripps offers advanced treatment technologies at its various radiation therapy facilities, as well as the Scripps Proton Therapy Cent er, the San Diego Gamma Knife Center, and through its minimally invasive surgical program and CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery. Additional resources incl ude specialized breast ar e centers, infusion clinics, nurse navigators, rehabilitation services, support groups and Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine. In August, Scripps announced a partnership with MD Anderson Cancer Center to create a comprehensive and c linically integrated cancer care program in San Diego. Work to est ablish the Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Care Center is now under way, and the program will be devel oped during the coming months. The partnership will create a compr ehensive and clinically integrat ed cancer care program. Scripps will combine its cancer expertise with leading knowledge, best practices and guidelines from MD Anderson to serve patients throughout S outhern California, covering eight counties from Santa Ba rbara to the U.S. -Mexican border. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 204 Scripps Cancer Center Support Group Programs Through generous community support Scripps C ancer Center is able to provide a wide range of support services and patient assi stance programs. Throughout the system, oncology social workers or cancer nurse navigators provide counseling services and guidance regarding transportation, housing, hom ecare, financial; b enefits, emotional concerns and other issues. Free professionally facilitated support groups sponsored by the cancer center meet regul arly at various locations to help patients and loved ones find support, guidance and encouragement. Free educational workshops are held at various sites. A popular 109-session expressive writing workshops is offered several times a year. Education lymphedema class is offered once a month to patients anticipating surgery. Cancer Registry Since 1975, the Scripps Cancer Registry has been collecting cancer data on Scripps patients for research, epidemio logical studies, education and patient treatment. Analysis of this data gives Scripps physicians the abi lity to measure the quality and effectiveness of the care cancer patient s receive within the Scripps system. Data also aids in determining which Cancer Center program s should be developed or further expanded. To date there are more than 132,000 cases in the Scripps Cancer Registry. Cancer registrants annually conduct follow-up on more than 23,000 cancer survivors. Scripps Proton Therapy Center In 2013, Scripps entered into a community co llaboration with Rady Children's Hospital San Diego and the University of California San Diego Hospit al for the provision of proton treatment at t he newly opened Scripps Proton Therapy Center. This was the first proton center in the nation to treat patient s exclusively with \"pencil-beam scanning,\" the most accurate form of proton therapy available. This enables doctors to \"paint\" radiation onto tumors layer by layer, with unmatched precision. Proton treatment beams can be delivered with such precision which reduces radiation exposure to healthy surrounding tissue. With five patient treatment room s and state -of-the-art imaging equipment on site, the center has the capacity to treat 2,400 patients annually. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 205 Scripps Clinical Research Center (SCRC) Research and clinical discovery has been pa rt of Scripps Health's mission since its founding in 1924. Scripps Clinical Research C enter consolidates and expands access to clinical research trials for physicians and patients across the Scri pps system and in all the communities Scripps serv es. The research mission is to provide comprehensive, expert support for Scripps physicians and staff, so that they may provide patients with access to new and emerging treatment oppor tunities when appropriate. In addition, Scripps coordinates its re search with nationally accr edited continuing and graduate medical education programs. In 2008, the Scripps Clinical Research Center was created to support clinical research throughout the Scripps system. The center s upports more than 25 medical specialties under one administration team. As a result, it accelerates the access to new technologies for physicians and patients by consolidating the various components of clinical investigation into a seamless, str eamlined regulatory and adm inistrative process. Scripps continues building in its strong foundati on for clinical and translational research through small pilot studies to large multicent er trails placed at all Scripps hospitals engaging both inpatient and outpatient se ttings. As ambulatory-based research increases across the system, Scripps supports more than 150 principal investigators and about 350 active clinical research prot ocols crossing interdisciplinary disease categories.

A year later through a joint effort with The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), STSI was selected to receive a National Inst itutes of Health Clinical. Translational Science Award (CTSA). The five-year, $20 milli on grant supports translational clinical research, infrastructure and training. In 2013, STSI received a second CTSA award for $33M for the next five years. STSI is dedicated to accelerating the \"trans lation\" of basic laboratory discoveries into clinical trials and, ultimately, approved treat ments. STSI through s eed funding, primarily supports collaborative opportuniti es between researchers at Scripps Health and The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) to produc e proof of concept studies. This funding allows collaborators to pursue promising and novel id eas by developing preliminary research findings in pilot studies that could lead to larger grants fr om National Institutes of Health, the biopharma and biotech industry, or other research fo undations. STSI also provides corollary support activities, such as biostatistics, bioinformatics, clinical trial staff, research training in clinical investigation and admin istrative support. Additionally, STSI has devel oped a strong program of deve loping and researching the application of digital technol ogy in the health care envir onment through digital devices and cell phone technologies. Several studies are underway looking at small adhesive skin patches and \"watches\" that assist with m onitoring chronic disease conditions 24/7 to catch faltering or declining heath sooner and effect remedy earlier. Catching and treating patients before they present at clinics and hospitals with serious health conditions holds great promise for better pat ient outcomes, healthcare cost reduction, and health self-awareness. STSI is looking to advance personalized medi cine based on an individual's genetic code. Today, virtually all standards of ca re are based on a drug or therapy's greatest common efficacy with the least amount of acc eptable side effects, leaving significant numbers of patients unaffected by a drug or therapy (non-responders). These non- responders may end up taking expensive medications or undergoing medical testing needlessly in a finically strapped health care environment. By defining the genetic codes that underlie susceptibility to disease, and ta king these findings from the laboratory to drug discovery and design to the patient's bedside, STSI seeks to usher in a new era of individualized care. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 207 Along similar lines, STSI has launched geno mic research efforts into idiopathic diseases, sudden unexplained deat h syndrome, and colorectal cancer gut micro biome, infectious diseases like Ebola and Zika , and circulating DNA in the blood system. The IDIOM study looks for genetic and underpinnings for patients and immediate family members who have medical conditions that have failed all other means of diagnosis. Similarly, the Molecular Autopsy study working with the San Diego County Coroner's Office uses genomic science to potentially uncover causes of unexplained death in people from birth to 44 that the Coroner's Office post-mortem examinations fail to detect a cause death. Finally, STSI is researching cell-free circulating DNA signatures in the blood system for early-on detection of tumo r presence and life- threatening cardiac conditions, all under the rubric of personalized, individu al health care. Scripps Translational Science Institute Community Engagement Program (STSI-CEP) The STSI Community Engagement Program (S TSI-CEP) is led by the nationally recognized Scripps Whittier Diabetes Inst itute, which has provided the San Diego community with the most advanced diabetes ca re, education, and support for more than 30 years. In addition to leading its own Cen R projects in diabetes and cardio metabolic disease, the STSI-CEP aims to enhance the in volvement of community in other areas of research. Scripps supports Community Enga gement Research (CEnR) that aims to bring researchers and community partners together to share their knowledge, skills and resources with a common goal of improvi ng community health.

Between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016, the percentage of clients with health in surance was 82%, a 3% increase from the previous year. As more people begin to have heal th insurance, 2-1-1 expects that client 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 215 needs will also begin to shift from seeking to obtain coverage to learning how to use their coverage. Many of the Health Navigation Program's c lients are already seeking the latter. This past year, Navigator's prov ided a deeper level of care coordination, preventative support, and advocacy to about 1, 000 clients.

Schedule H Methodology \u2014 Schedule H requires the uncompensated care to be divided into four categories: Charity ca re, under-reimbursed Medi-Cal and Other Means Tested Government Programs, Bad Deb t, and under-reimbursed Medicare. Bad debt and Medicare shortfalls are reportable under the Schedule H guidelines but do not count towards the community benefit totals . Thus, the categorie s are reported in a specific order/hierarchy. Charity Care and under-reimbursed Medi-Cal and Other Means Tested Government Programs are counted first. Charity Care Methodology \u2014 The uncompensated cost is estimated by applying ratio- cost-to-charge (RCC) percentages for the hospital to the gross charity adjustments. The following costs are excluded: Community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. Traditional Charity Care is included in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990 Schedule H Part I Line 7a.

Operating margin is def ined as net revenue less all variable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitabilit y is estimated as follows: Net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the account balance for all open accounts, plus revenue from uncompensated care pools in cluding Medi-Cal DSH. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation me thodology per the McKesson HPM system. The following costs are excluded: Charity adjustments at cost for Medi-Cal patients, community health services, professiona l education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. T hese costs are included in the IRS Form 990 schedule H Part I Line 7b. In the State of California the Medicaid program is called Medi-Cal.

Operating margin is defined as net revenue 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 230 less all variable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an es timation of the account balance for all open accounts, plus other revenue including IME and DSH. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the McKesson HPM cost accounting system. The following costs are excluded: Charit y and bad debt adjustments at cost for Medicare and Medicare Senior patients, community health services, professional education and research, subsidized health servic es provided to Medicare patients, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost r eport. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section B. Bad Debt Methodology \u2014 The uncompensated cost is estimated by applying ratio- cost-to-charge (RCC) percentage s for the hospital to the gross bad debt adjustments less recoveries. The following costs are ex cluded: Bad debt adjus tments at cost for Medi-Cal and CMS patients, community heal th services, professional education and research, and expenses exclude d in the Medicare cost report. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section A. Shortfall Methodology-Clinics \u2014 The shortfall was derived by extracting the Medicare, Medicare PPO, Medicare HMO, and Medicare Capitated program, gross charges and net revenue from the patient billing system. T he cost was estimated by applying the ratio-cost- to-charges for Scri pps Clinic and Scripps Coastal Medical Centers to the gross charges. Shortfall is equal to Net Revenue less estimated cost using RCC methodology. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section B.

In 1994, California legislators passed Senate Bill 697 (SB 697), which requires all private nonpr ofit hospitals in the state to conduct a CHNA every three years. Since 1994, t hese programs have been created based on an assessment of needs identified through hos pital data, community input, and major trends. Previous collaborations among nonp rofit hospitals, healthcare systems, and other community partners have resulted in numerous well regarded Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA) reports. Informa tion is gathered through the CHNA for the purposes of reporting community benefit, devel oping strategic plan s, creating annual reports, providing input on legislative decis ions, and informing the general community of health issues and trends. Federal Requirements In 2010, Congress added several new require ments for hospital organizations to maintain federal income tax exempt st atus under Section 501 (r) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\") as part of the Affor dable Care Act. One of the requirements set forth in Section 501 (r) of the Code is for each hos pital organization to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) at least once every three tax years. The requirement to conduct a CHNA applies to Scri pps Health, which is a health system that operates four hospital facilities. In addition, Scripps Health must adopt a triennial Implementation Plan which is separate written document to address certain community health needs identified in the CHNA by S eptember 30, 2016. Additional information on the ACA requirements for nonprof it hospitals can be found at www.irs.gov , keyword: \"Charitable Organizations\". Required Components of the Community Health Needs Assessment Per IRS requirements, (Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.501 (r)-3(b)(6)(i)) t he following are components the CHNA must include: A description of the community serv ed by the health system and how it was determined A description of the processes and methods used to conduct the assessment 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 235 A description of how the hospital organiza tion took into account input from persons who represent the broad intere sts of the community served by the hospital facility Prioritized description of all of the co mmunity health needs i dentified through the CHNA, as well as a description of the pr ocess and criteria used in prioritizing such health needs. A description of the existing health care facilities and other resources with the community available to m eet the community health nee ds identified in the CHNA. An evaluation of the impact of any acti ons that were taken since the hospital finished conducting its immediately prec eding CHNA to address the significant health needs identified in the prior CHNA. Make the CHNA widely available to the public via the hospital's website. Required Components of the Implementation Strategy Provisions in the Affordable Care Act permi t a hospital facility that adopts a joint CHNA report to also adopt a joint implementation strategy which, with respect to each significant health need identified through the joint CHNA, either describes how one or more collaborating facilities plan to address the health need or identifies the health need as one collaborating facilities do not intend to address. The join implementation strategy adopted for the hospital facility must: (Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.501 (r)-3(c) (4). Meet community health needs identif ied in the CHNA. Describe any needs identified in the CHNA that are not being addressed and the reasons for not addressing them Be clearly identified as applying to the hospital facility Clearly identify the hospit al facility's particular roles and responsibilities in taking the actions described in the implement ation strategy, and the programs and resources the hospital facility plans to commit to such actions Include a summary or other tool that hel ps the reader easily locate those portions of the joint implementation strategy t hat relates to the hospital facility. 2017 Scripps Community Benefit Plan "}
