They claim to oppose alternative medicine because it lacks efficacy, may waste precious health care dollars and may harm patients. Part II of this Article examines the ongoing debate about alternative medicine and the arguments that may wedge the door of Western medicine open to alternative treatment methods. Alternative medicine's successful entry into Western practice depends on convincing conventional medicine of the efficacy of alternative treatments, a task that remains largely undone. Part III explains why the debate about unproven alternative therapies differs from previous discussions about human research, and therefore merits independent consideration. Part IV argues that it is not ethically appropriate for physicians to offer or agree to provide alternative therapies whose efficacy remain unproven or are of dubious potential. - Type - Articles - Information [American Journal of Law & Medicine](/core/journals/american-journal-of-law-and-medicine), [Volume 24](/core/journals/american-journal-of-law-and-medicine/volume/B31A626E6EB89561F13323BB7BDB91AB), [Issue 2-3](/core/journals/american-journal-of-law-and-medicine/issue/3DB1D769BB4936DB472048817B84A4B4), 1998 , pp. 185 - 212 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 American Society of Law, Medicine and Ethics and Boston University 1998 References 1 To dispel the perception that alternative medicine is nonconventional and therefore potentially dangerous, many advocate using the term complementary. See David Weber, The Mainstreaming of Alternative Medicine, HEALTHCARE FORUM J., Nov./Dec. 1996, at 16, 20. By using this nomenclature, some acknowledge that alternative medicine does not displace, but rather complements, Western or conventional medicine. See id. (citing Larry Dossey, M.D., editor of Alternative Therapies). In its study of alternative cancer treatments in the mid-eighties, the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) chose \"to describe treatments outside of mainstream medical practice and research\" as unconventional treatments. OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, UNCONVENTIONAL CANCER TREATMENTS (SUMMARY) 1 (1990) [hereinafter OTA SUMMARY]. In choosing this term, the OTA observed: \"Other terms used by proponents to describe all or some of these treatments include: alternative, complementary, nontoxic, holistic, natural, and noninvasive. Those used by the sharpest of critics include: unproven, questionable, dubious, quackery, and fraudulent.\" Id. at 4. The term \"traditional medicine\" is \"widely used to refer to various types of native healers and treatments.\" Id. I do not specifically address either traditional medicine or faith healing in this Article. 2 Paul Starr describes the challenge that the first colonial physicians faced as they sought to displace their competitors: \"Lay practitioners, using native herbs and folk remedies, flourished in the countryside and towns, scorning the therapies and arcane learning of regular physicians and claiming the right to practice medicine as an inalienable liberty, comparable to religious freedom.\" STARR, PAUL, THE SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION OF AMERICAN MEDICINE 31 (1982) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=STARR,+PAUL,+THE+SOCIAL+TRANSFORMATION+OF+AMERICAN+MEDICINE+31+(1982)). 3 Andrews, Lori B., The Shadow Health Care System: Regulation of Alternative Health Care Providers, 32 Hous.

See Benjamin Freedman et al., Non-validated Therapies and HIV Disease, HASTINGS CENTER REP., May-June 1989, at 14, 15. One commentator stated, \"[C]ontrary to the stereotype of the uneducated, credulous patient victimized by the unscrupulous practitioner, '[t]he evidence seems overwhelming that socioeconomic status is either independent of the use of such therapies or that higher status and better educated individuals are over represented among the patients of unorthodox practitioners.'\" Id. at 15 (quoting Cassileth, B.R. & Brown, H., Unorthodox Cancer Medicine, 38 CA-CANCER J. CLINICIANS 176 (1988) [CrossRef](https://dx.doi.org/10.3322/canjclin.38.3.176) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Unorthodox+Cancer+Medicine%2C&author=Cassileth+B.R.&author=Brown+H.&publication+year=1988&journal=CA-CANCER+J.+CLINICIANS&volume=38&doi=10.3322%2Fcanjclin.38.3.176)). Reliance on unconventional providers is more significant among college graduates and those with higher incomes. See Eisenberg, David M. et al., Unconventional Medicine in the United States, 328 NEW ENG. J. MED. 246, 248 (1993) [CrossRef](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199301283280406) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Unconventional+Medicine+in+the+United+States%2C&author=Eisenberg+David+M.&publication+year=1993&journal=NEW+ENG.+J.+MED.&volume=328&doi=10.1056%2FNEJM199301283280406). 5 A recent study projected that \"the per capita supply of alternative medicine clinicians (chiropractors, naturopaths, and practitioners of oriental medicine) will grow by 88 percent between 1994 and 2010, while physician supply will grow by 16 percent.\" Cooper, Richard A. & Stoflet, Sandi J., Trends in the Education and Practice of Alternative Medicine Clinicians, 15 HEALTH AFF. 226, 226 (1996) [CrossRef](https://dx.doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.15.3.226) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Trends+in+the+Education+and+Practice+of+Alternative+Medicine+Clinicians%2C&author=Cooper+Richard+A.&author=Stoflet+Sandi+J.&publication+year=1996&journal=HEALTH+AFF.&volume=15&doi=10.1377%2Fhlthaff.15.3.226). Patient visits to alternative practitioners outnumber visits to their primary care providers. See Ernst, Edzard et al., Complementary Medicine, 155 ARCHIVES INTERNAL MED. 2405, 2405 (1995) [CrossRef](https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archinte.1995.00430220059006) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Complementary+Medicine%2C&author=Ernst+Edzard&publication+year=1995&journal=ARCHIVES+INTERNAL+MED.&volume=155&doi=10.1001%2Farchinte.1995.00430220059006). In 1990, for example, about one in three adults used some form of alternative therapy, spending $10.3 billion that was not reimbursed by an insurer. See Cynthia Starr, Exploring the Other Health Care Systems\u2014Alternative Medicine: Part I, PATIENT CARE, July 15, 1997, at 134, 135. Patients seek out alternative medicine to relieve back problems, arthritis, AIDS, gastrointestinal problems, eating disorders, chronic renal failure, anxiety, headaches, chronic pain and cancer. See id. at 139; Eisenberg et al., supra note 4, at 246. \"Almost 9 of 10 respondents (89 percent) who saw a provider of unconventional therapy in 1990 did so without the recommendation of their medical doctor. In more than 7 of 10 instances (72 percent), users of unconventional therapy did not inform their medical doctor of their use of the therapy.\" Id. at 249. 6 See infra Part III.A.1-3. 7 See Jeffrey Kluger, Mr. Natural: Millions of Americans Swear by the Alternative Medicine of Dr. Andrew Weil, TIME, May 12, 1997 at 68, 70-71 (noting that Andrew Weil's newest book, 8 Weeks to Optimum Health, was in its eighth week on the best sellers list, that Spontaneous Healing was in its 65th week and that Deepak Chopra \"has enjoyed perennial best-seller status since the 1993 publication of Ageless Body, Timeless Mind\"). 8 Perhaps the most colorful of these integrative practitioners, Weil, is a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Medical School. See WEIL, ANDREW, 8 WEEKS TO OPTIMUM HEALTH 70 (1997) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=WEIL,+ANDREW,+8+WEEKS+TO+OPTIMUM+HEALTH+70+(1997)). As a fellow of the Institute of Current World Affairs, he traveled throughout the world collecting information about medicinal plants and healing, which he now relies on extensively in his practice. See id. Dr. Weil is the founder of the Center for Integrative Medicine in Tucson, Arizona, and the director of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona. See id. Deepak Chopra, M.D., also a prolific author, was until recently the director of the Institute for Mind/Body Medicine and Human Potential at Sharp HealthCare in San Diego. See DEEPAK CHOPRA, AGELESS BODY, TIMELESS MIND (1993). In 1992 he became a member of the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) ad hoc panel on alternative medicine. See id. 9 David Eisenberg's 1991 study found that the majority of expenditures for alternative therapy were self-paid, with third-party payers most likely covering herbal therapy, biofeedback, chiropractic and megavitamins. See Eisenberg et al., supra note 4, at 250. This is beginning to change, however. A recent report estimates that \"at least 41 state governments now require chiropractic coverage in some form; six require acupuncture coverage; and nine license naturopaths.\" Managed Care Organizations Begin Covering Alternative Treatment, 12 MED. MALPRACTICE L. & STRATEGY 3, 3 (1996) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Managed+Care+Organizations+Begin+Covering+Alternative+Treatment,+12+MED.+MALPRACTICE+L.+&+STRATEGY+3,+3+(1996)). In 1995, Washington became the first state to enact legislation requiring health plans to reimburse medical providers for all types of medical care, including alternative medicine. See 1995 Wash. Legis. Serv. ch. 265 \u00a7 8 (West) (codified at WASH. REV. CODE \u00a7 48.43.045 (Supp. 1998)) (applicable to health plans issued or renewed after January 1, 1996). This legislation, known as the Alternative Provider Mandate Statute, reads in part, \"Every health plan delivered ... shall: (1) Permit every category of health care provider to provide health services or care for conditions included in the basic health plan services.\" Id. This victory for alternative medicine was short-lived, however, because in May 1997, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington held that the statute was preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. See Washington Physicians Serv. v. Gregorie, 967 F. Supp. 424, 431 (W.D. Wash. 1997). See generally Cohen, Michael H., Holistic Health Care: Including Alternative and Complementary Medicine in Insurance and Regulatory Schemes, 38 ARIZ. L. REV. 83, 106-09, 154-59 (1996) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Holistic+Health+Care%3A+Including+Alternative+and+Complementary+Medicine+in+Insurance+and+Regulatory+Schemes%2C&author=Cohen+Michael+H.&publication+year=1996&journal=ARIZ.+L.+REV.&volume=38) (advocating coverage of alternative medicine). 10 A recent study of physicians' attitudes about alternative therapies revealed that more than 90% of those surveyed considered diet and exercise, behavioral medicine, biofeedback, and counseling or psychotherapy as legitimate medical practices. More than 50 percent of physicians considered acupuncture, massage therapy, and hypnotherapy as legitimate medical practices.... At the same time, however, herbal medicine, homeopathic medicine, Native American medicine, traditional Oriental medicine, and electromagnetic applications were generally considered to be legitimate medical practice by less than 27 percent of the respondents. Brian M. Berman et al., Physicians' Attitudes Toward Complementary or Alternative Medicine: A Regional Survey, 8 J. AM. BOARD FAM. PRAC. 361, 362-63 (1995). However, other studies indicate that inexperienced physicians take a more optimistic view of complementary medicine. See Ernst et al., supra note 5, at 2406. The Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) estimates that about 30 to 100 M.D.'s in the United States practice anthroposophically extended medicine, meaning they incorporate naturopathy and homeopathy into their traditional practices. See Alternative Systems of Medical Practice\u2014Fields of Practice (visited on Feb. 2, 1998) [http://altmed.od.nih.gov/oam/what-is-cam/fields/alternative.shtml](http://altmed.od.nih.gov/oam/what-is-cam/fields/alternative.shtml). About half of the practitioners listed in the Directory of the National Center for Homeopathy are physicians. See National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF) Position Paper on Homeopathy (visited Mar. 26, 1998) [http://www.ncahf.org/pos-pap/homeop.html](http://www.ncahf.org/pos-pap/homeop.html) [hereinafter NCAHF Position Paper on Homeopathy]. On the other hand, although the number appears to be increasing, \"only about 500 of more than 600,000 physicians use homeopathic remedies.\" Mahlon W. Wagner, Is Homeopathy 'New Science' or 'New Age'?, 1 SCI. REV. ALTERNATIVE MED. 7, 10 (1997). Physicians, who have long sought to eliminate the chiropractic profession, see infra notes 60-72 and accompanying text, have now been convinced of the usefulness of spinal manipulation for back pain and are increasingly inclined to offer this service to patients. One commentator recently observed: Unless the chiropractic profession as a whole specializes in the physical treatment of back disorders ... and earns reciprocity with other healing professions ... there will be no justification for the existence of chiropractic when an adequate number of medical specialists and medical technicians make scientific manipulation available in a department of medical practice... . In the meantime, orthopedic specialists, neurologists, family physicians, and other medical practitioners are often compelled to refer a patient to a chiropractor for manipulation when such treatment is indicated for back pain. Samuel Homola, Finding A Good Chiropractor, ARCHIVES FAM. MED., Jan.-Feb. 1998, at 20, 22. Samuel Homola further suggests that, even if chiropractic is determined to have value in treating disease or infection, patients may still be better off obtaining treatment in these situations from physicians who can offer alternatives if manipulative therapy does not work. See id. 11 One article describes the debate over the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) consideration of unconventional cancer treatments: \"Opponents cite the unsubstantiated claims of proponents, which entice the desperate to try the treatment\u2014regardless of the physical, emotional, and financial expense it may entail. Proponents perceive discrimination when their grant proposals fare poorly in peer review and feel persecuted when regulatory agencies investigate them.\" Hawkins, Michael J. & Friedman, Michael A., National Cancer Institute's Evaluation of Unconventional Cancer Treatments, 84 J.

ACSH: Medical Care (visited on Feb. 6, 1998) [http://www.acsh.org/medical/index.html](http://www.acsh.org/medical/index.html). In addition, the American Cancer Society, which publishes \"Unproven Methods List,\" actively discourages patients from pursuing unconventional therapies. See OTA SUMMARY, supra note 1, at 3. 16 See, e.g., Sampson, Wallace, Why a New Alternative Medicine Journal?, 1 SCI. REV.

John Dingell (D-Mich.), Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, asked the OTA to report on unconventional cancer treatments. See Fintor, Lou, OTA Report Disputes Success of Unconventional Cancer Therapies, 82 J. NAT'L CANCER INST. 1668, 1668 (1990) [CrossRef](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jnci/82.21.1668) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=OTA+Report+Disputes+Success+of+Unconventional+Cancer+Therapies%2C&author=Fintor+Lou&publication+year=1990&journal=J.+NAT'L+CANCER+INST.&volume=82&doi=10.1093%2Fjnci%2F82.21.1668). Later that same year, a group led by Congressman Guy Molinari asked OTA specifically to study Immuno-Augmentative Therapy (IAT) after an IAT clinic was closed by the Bahamanian government. See OTA SUMMARY, supra note 1, at iii, 2. 18 The OAM was instituted pursuant to congressional mandate under the 1992 NIH Appropriations Bill and \"is organized under the Associate Director of Disease Prevention within the Office of the Director of the NIH.\" General Information\u2014About the OAM (visited Apr. 2, 1998) [http://altmed.od.nih.gOv/oam/about/general.shtml#history](http://altmed.od.nih.gOv/oam/about/general.shtml#history). \"The Congressional mandate establishing the OAM stated that the Office's purpose is to 'facilitate the evaluation of alternative medical treatment modalities' to determine their effectiveness.\" Id. \"This mandate also provides for a public information clearinghouse and a research training program.\" Id. The OAM \"facilitates and conducts research.\" Id. 19 During the summer of 1997, OAM critics, including several prominent scientists, conducted a letter writing campaign to induce Congress to eliminate the OAM, \"accusing the office of lending credibility to quackery.\" Vogel, Gretchen, Senate Hears Testimony Supporting OAM, 278 SCIENCE 378,378(1997) [CrossRef](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.278.5337.378) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Senate+Hears+Testimony+Supporting+OAM%2C&author=Vogel+Gretchen&publication+year=1997&journal=SCIENCE&volume=278&doi=10.1126%2Fscience.278.5337.378). 20 Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who was instrumental in OAM's creation, wants it upgraded to a National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research by tripling its $43.7 million budget. See Wadman, Meredith, Row Over Alternative Medicine's Status at NIH, 389 NATURE 652, 652(1997) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Row+Over+Alternative+Medicine's+Status+at+NIH%2C&author=Wadman+Meredith&publication+year=1997&journal=NATURE&volume=389). 21 As originally established in 1991, OAM has no independent authority to fund grants. Alternative medicine advocates argue that research proposals are subject to the bias of NIH reviewers, who do not include a single alternative practitioner, such as a chiropractor or acupuncturist. See NIH Clinical Research: Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Public Health on Safety of the Senate Comm. on Labor and Human Resources, 105th Cong. (1997) (statement of James S. Gordon, M.D.), available in 1997 WL 14152117. Currently, \"there are approximately 26 standing review committees in NIH, with 125 people,\" none of whom hold degrees or are licensed in any of the commonly used complementary or alternative therapies. Id.; see also Hawkins & Friedman, supra note 11, at 1699, 1700 (citing criticisms of the NCI for not funding or conducting clinical trials of unconventional cancer therapies; the authors respond that what these critics actually seek is preferential treatment for funding of scientifically unsupported claims). 22 The OTA itself observed: [O]ne of the major rifts separating supporters of unconventional treatments from those in mainstream medical care and research is a distinct difference in what they accept as evidence of benefit. Objective, informed examination of unconventional treatments is thus difficult, if not impossible, in the United States today. Acrimonious debate between the unconventional and mainstream communities reaches well beyond scientific argument into social, legal, and consumer issues. Sides are closely drawn and the rhetoric is often bitter and confrontational. OTA SUMMARY, supra note 1, at 3. Legitimate questions exist not only about the appropriate methods for testing complementary medicine, but about testing genetic therapies as well. A number of issues have converged in the last few years to raise doubts about randomized clinical trials generally. For further discussion of this issue, see infra notes 135-42. 23 See Hawkins & Friedman, supra note 11, at 1700. Another researcher, John P. Vandenbroucke, criticized attempted trials of homeopathy, noting that \"[t]he problem with homoeopathy is that the 'infinite dilutions' of the agents used cannot possibly produce any effect. A randomized trial of 'solvent only' versus 'infinite dilutions' is a game of chance between two placebos.\" Jan P. Vandenbroucke, Homeopathy Trials: Going Nowhere, 350 LANCET 824, 824 (1997). 24 See Wagner, supra note 10, at 8, 10 (discussing claims that homeopathy has satisfied patients for over 200 years and should not have to meet requirements of scientific medicine). 25 See id. at 8 (discussing the suggestion that science is not relevant to evaluating homeopathy because conventional researchers refuse to accept the concept of the \"vital force\"); OTA SUMMARY, supra note 1, at 20 (discussing belief of some psychological practitioners and researchers that experimental methods are neither necessary nor appropriate to test their approaches); Ernst, Edzard & Kaptchuck, Theodore J., Homeopathy Revisited, 156 ARCHIVES INTERNAL MED. 2162, 2164 (1996) [CrossRef](https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archinte.1996.00440180014001) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Homeopathy+Revisited%2C&author=Ernst+Edzard&author=Kaptchuck+Theodore+J.&publication+year=1996&journal=ARCHIVES+INTERNAL+MED.&volume=156&doi=10.1001%2Farchinte.1996.00440180014001) (responding to claim that modern trial methods are inapplicable to homeopathy). For additional discussion, see infra text accompanying notes 81-86. 26 Samuel Benjamin, M.D., Director of the Integrative Arizona Center for Health and Medicine, who has combined his education in pediatrics with \"training in Mexican indigenous healing, herbal medicine, hypnosis, and acupuncture,\" is a frequent critic in this regard. Weber, supra note 1, at 21. 27 See generally Andrews, supra note 3, at 1283-89 (discussing instances of better quality of care provided by alternative providers as compared with physicians, at lower cost). 28 One could interpret In re Guess as such a case. 393 S.E.2d 833 (N.C. 1990). Guess involved a physician's appeal of the revocation of his license solely because he engaged homeopathic methods in his practice, even though no patient harm had occurred. In responding to Guess's argument that the court's decision would quash any future medical innovation, the court stated, \"the development and acceptance of such new practices simply must be achieved by 'acceptable and prevailing' methods of medical research, experimentation, testing, and approval by the appropriate regulatory or professional bodies.\" Id. at 839. In comparison, a 1980 Florida case held that the state medical board had exceeded its police power when it suspended a physician's license because of his use of chelation therapy in the absence of a demonstration of harm or fraud, and where the physician had clearly \"allowed his patients to make their own choice as to whether to begin this treatment after full disclosure that this methodology has not been proven effective, ... Dr. Rogers never claimed it was a cure.\" State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs v. Rogers, 387 So. 2d 937, 939 (Fla. 1980). See generally Cohen, supra note 9, at 111-32 (discussing the history and litigation of homeopathy, chelation therapy, ozone therapy and other disfavored therapies, and the boundaries of chiropractic practice). The New York law governing the state board for professional medical conduct specifically provides that the board shall include at least two physicians \"who dedicate a significant portion of their practice to the use of non-conventional medical treatments.\" N.Y. PUB. HEALTH LAW \u00a7 230(1) (McKinney 1998). 29 Recall that the alternative medicine consumer tends to be educated and more affluent than the average patient. See supra note 4. I disagree with Andrews's suggestion that because it is the more educated and affluent among us who most frequently utilize alternative medicine, consumer protection is a less pressing concern. See Andrews, supra note 3, at 1316. For example, in Charell v. Gonzalez, 660 N.Y.S.2d 665 (Sup. Ct. 1997), the court, in determining whether plaintiff assumed the risks attendant to receiving coffee enemas rather than chemotherapy for her cancer, noted that: Plaintiff was a well educated person who, together with her husband and daughter, did a significant amount of investigation regarding the treatment being offered by defendant and hence became quite knowledgeable on the subject, and that she sought to avoid the suffering that accompanied the chemotherapy/radiation regimen that she had witnessed when a relative had undertaken treatment. Id. at 669. The court later indicated its awareness of the controversy between the medical profession and alternative medicine proponents, but noted that \"defendant failed to produce a single witness at trial who defended his treatment of plaintiff as medically sound, whereas plaintiff's experts clearly painted him as a charlatan,\" and upheld the award of punitive damages. Id. This case supports a view contrary to Andrews's, because the educated and affluent do not stand equal to the scientific and medical knowledge proffered by the \"expert,\" the physician, especially when ill, or in pain, and desperate for relief. Thus, I contend that some form of consumer protection remains necessary in this area. 30 External pressures to integrate alternative therapies into conventional medicine are coming from consumers, who are now spending $13 billion per year on alternative treatment. See Lynna Goch, Alternative Medicine Moves into the Mainstream, BEST's REVIEW, Mar. 1997, at 84, 84. Some health maintenance organizations (HMOs), interested in cost-effectiveness, favor alternative procedures; a growing number of states license chiropractors, acupuncturists and naturopathic physicians. See id. In addition, many corporations seeking to reduce health care costs have focused on wellness and prevention programs for their employees. See Howard Fine, Hospitals, HMOs Embracing Preventive Medicine, L.A. Bus. J., Sept. 22, 1997, at 23, 23. Such programs include the utilization of alternative therapies such as acupuncture and massage. See id. 31 I do not address physicians charging patients for their provision of alternative therapies, but it is an extremely important subject that encompasses two different issues. The first issue is outright fraud: charging for invalidated treatments, that the physician knows will do the patient absolutely no good. The second issue is more difficult: charging patients for nonvalidated treatments, even with sufficiently informed consent. Most attention in this area seems to focus on concerns about fraud. The NCAHF accused homeopathy of providing a haven to untrustworthy and incompetent practitioners. See NCAHF Position Paper on Homeopathy, supra note 10. Physician fraud can become an issue in malpractice cases. In Charell v. Gonzalez, the plaintiff \"offered evidence to show that defendant's practice of prescribing nutrition as a cure was designed to enable companies in which he had a financial interest to sell product.\" 660 N.Y.S.2d at 669. Some physician licensing boards find it easier to respond to concerns about physicians' alternative therapeutic offerings by focusing on their billing practices rather than grappling with the efficacy of their treatments. See, e.g., Catena v. Commonwealth, 411 A.2d 869, 873 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1980) (holding that a medical licensing board could suspend a physician's license on Medicare fraud grounds after physician prescribed \"inadequate treatment\" to treat patient's obesity). Aware of this, some are concerned that the widely heralded Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), enacted in part to reduce billing fraud, see 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1320a-7c (West Supp. 1998), will lead to widespread criminal prosecution of alternative medicine providers. See Physicians May Fall Prey to Quack Busters, VEGETARIAN TIMES, May 1, 1997, at 18, 18. The concern apparently arose even before HIPAA's passage, as the Conference Report specifically states that the practice of alternative or investigative medicine is not itself fraudulent. See H.R. CONF. REP. No. 104-736, at 258 (1996). The conferees further stated that Congress did not intend HIPAA to prohibit the practice of \"complementary, alternative, innovative, experimental, or investigational [medicine].\" Id. In addition: The Act is not intended to penalize a person who exercises a health care treatment choice or makes a medical or health care judgment in good faith simply because there is a difference of opinion regarding the form of diagnosis or treatment. Nor does this provision in general prohibit plans from covering specific types of treatment. Whether certain complementary and alternative practices will be covered is and should be a decision left to the health care plan administrators. Id. 32 According to the Health Insurance Association of America, several states require insurance companies to cover various alternative therapies, such as chiropractor and naturopath services. See Gina Kolata, On Fringes of Health Care, Untested Therapies Thrive, N.Y. TIMES, June 17, 1996, at Al. Oxford Health Plans allows patients to go directly to its \"new specialists,\" who include chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopathic doctors, massage therapists, nutritionists and yoga instructors, without getting approval from a primary care physician. See Vincler, Lisa A. & Nicol, Mary F., When Ignorance Isn't Bliss: What Healthcare Practitioners and Facilities Should Know About Complementary and Alternative Medicine, 30 J. HEALTH & HOSP.

According to Alan Dumoff, MCOs have instituted procedures to ensure that alternative health care providers have the requisite state credentials to practice alternative medicine. See id. Furthermore, MCOs also require that alternative care providers be accredited by other private organizations, including the National Commission for the Certification of Acupuncturists. See id.

Veterans Administration, for example, the court treated as \"experimental\" the defendant physician's daily administration of 700 Rads of radiation to the plaintiff, when neither the literature nor any other evidence of the standard of care supported administering more than 200-250 Rads per day. 537 F.2d 1098, 1099-100 (10th Cir. 1976). In fact, the court observed that \"[t]he giving of seven hundred (700) Rads a day was not in accordance with anybody's standard.\" Id. at 1101. As such, the court held that \"in order for a physician to avoid liability by engaging in drastic or experimental treatment, which exceeds the bounds of established medical standards, his patient must always be fully informed of the experimental nature of the treatment and of the foreseeable consequences of the treatment.\" Id. at 1102. 40 The terms used in this Article are prone to analytic confusion. See generally Nancy M.P. King, Experimental Treatment: Oxymoron or Aspiration, HASTINGS CENTER REP., July-Aug. 1995, at 6, 9 (discussing analytic confusion created by referring to therapies still in the experimental or research stages as either therapy or treatment). The term practice used in conventional medicine refers to \"interventions that are designed solely to enhance the well-being of an individual patient or client and that have a reasonable expectation of success.\" Protection of Human Subjects; Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research, Report of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, 44 Fed. Reg. 23192, 23,193 (1979). However, the general term practice as used in this Article neither connotes that the activity is proven or unproven (validated or nonvalidated) nor denotes whether the practitioner is conventional or alternative. 41 Benjamin Freedman has proposed a useful definition for nonvalidated therapies which, though not entirely applicable to alternative medicine, provides a useful starting point: [N]onvalidated therapies [are] those drugs, medical and surgical interventions, and regimens that are offered to and accepted by a patient on the basis of potential benefit, and that have neither been accepted nor discredited by the expert clinical community. Nonvalidated therapies are distinct from, on the one hand, customary and accepted treatments; and, on the other, quack remedies. Benjamin Freedman et al., supra note 4, at 14. 42 Nancy King provides a very helpful distinction among experimentation, treatment and what she calls \"experimental treatment.\" See King, supra note 40, at 9. Medical research has been defined to include \"a class of activities designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge and generalizable knowledge consists of theories, principles, or relationships (or the accumulation of data on which they may be based) that can be corroborated by accepted scientific observation and inference.\" Vodopest v. MacGregor, 913 P.2d 779, 785-86 (Wash. 1996) (en banc). 43 Eisenberg and his colleagues found, in fact, that \"a substantial amount of unconventional therapy is used for nonserious medical conditions, health promotion, or disease prevention.\" Eisenberg et al., supra note 4, at 251. 44 See generally Annas, George J., Faith (Healing), Hope and Charity at the FDA: The Politics of AIDS Drug Trials, 34 VILL.

TIMES, Aug. 4, 1995, at 14. Each group then receives a different treatment. See id. Neither patients nor researchers know which group has received the alternative treatment and which one has received the placebo until the study has been concluded.

See Evelyn Gilbert, Chiropractors' Popularity Prompts Product Launch, NAT'L UNDERWRITER PROP. & CASUALTY-RISK & BENEFITS MGMT., Sept. 18, 1995, at 21, 21. \"Chiropractic is the largest drug-free health-care profession in the country, with about 50,000 doctors of chiropractic (D.C.s) treating millions of patients in the United States.\" Greg Beaubien, Image Adjustment: Chiropractors Gain Acceptance in the Medical Field, BUFFALO NEWS, Mar. 28, 1995, at C3, available in 1995 WL 5461039. 63 The main organ for the elimination of chiropractic treatment was the American Medical Association's (AMA) Committee on Quackery, which was formed in 1962. See OTA SUMMARY, supra note 1, at 3. In Wilk v. American Medical Ass'n, 895 F.2d 352, 355 (7th Cir. 1990), four licensed chiropractors sued the AMA and other professional organizations for conspiring to restrain the trade of chiropractors. The alleged conspiracy involved, among other things, a provision in the AMA's principles of medical ethics banning physician affiliations with chiropractors. See id. In 1987, a federal judge issued a permanent injunction against the AMA. See id. In 1990, the AMA eliminated its ban on affiliation, and in 1991, the AMA paid the chiropractors $53.5 million in legal costs. See David Burda, AMA Conspiracy Case Comes to an End, MODERN HEALTHCARE, Dec. 3, 1990, at 14, 14. Following the Wilk decision, the AMA disbanded the Committee on Quackery. See OTA SUMMARY, supra note 1, at 3. See generally Andrews, supra note 3, at 1291-96 (discussing the numerous efforts the AMA has undertaken to quash alternative practitioners and the minimal legal success alternative practitioners have had in bringing antitrust suits against the AMA). 64 A recent spate of studies on the efficacy of manipulation for lower back pain, including a federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research study, partially explains the surge of referrals by physicians to chiropractors. See Weis, Gerald R., Chiropractic Referrals Reduce Neuromusculoskeletal Health Care Costs, 23 J.

See id. at 24. In addition, four-year chiropractic colleges are recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. See id. 68 A recent article summarizing the literature on spinal manipulation and back pain states: In 1991, RAND, a nonprofit research organization, published the first of a 4-part report on the effectiveness, complications, and indications for spinal manipulation for back pain. This multidisciplinary review of the literature on back pain supported the use of spinal manipulation as a treatment for patients with acute low back pain without symptoms of lower limb nerve-root involvement and other contraindicating signs.... Support in the literature was less clear, insufficient, or conflicting for the use of spinal manipulation in treating subacute and chronic back pain, with or without neurologic findings or sciatica C indicating a great need for additional research. Reporting similar findings, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research of the US Department of Health and Human Services published a report that concluded that, in the absence of red flags, \"manipulation can be helpful for patients with acute low back problems without radiculopathy when used within the first month of symptoms.\" Homola, supra note 10, at 21. See generally NCAHF Position Paper on Chiropractic (visited Apr. 2, 1998) [http://www.ncahf.org/pos-pap/chirop.html](http://www.ncahf.org/pos-pap/chirop.html) (summarizing clinical articles establishing efficacy of manipulative therapy). 69 See Homola, supra note 10, at 20. Physicians complain that chiropractic continues to be defined as a \"method of restoring and maintaining health rather than as a method of treating back pain.\" Id. at 21. 70 See id. Existing data neither support nor refute spine manipulation for \"cervical curvatures; migraine headache; shoulder, arm and torticollis; infantile colic; and otitis media.\" Id. at 22. 71 Chiropractic care provides no benefit for many ailments, and in some cases may exacerbate the patient's problem. See Rick Weiss, Bones of Contention, HEALTH, July/Aug. 1993, at 44, 46. The RAND report found that over 57% of cervical spine manipulations by chiroprators were inappropriate. See Homola, supra note 10, at 22. 72 According to Reed Phillips, president of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic, recent studies provide no support for the use of x-rays by chiropractors for most cases of low back pain. See Weiss, supra note 71, at 46. 73 Chiropractic practitioners fall into different schools. Neofundamentalists \"take a holistic, preventive approach to health and believe they can treat far more than back pain.\" Chiropractic Manipulation, HARV. WOMEN's HEALTH WATCH, Dec. 1995, at 4, 5. Revisionists \"seek to recast chiropractic in the image of medical science, concentrating on spinal mechanics and back pain.\" Id. 74 Some chiropractors also practice naturopathy, which: may include shining colored light on the patient (i.e., chromotherapy) on the theory that red ... might be used in ailments of the blood ... orange is helpful in fevers ... yellow rays aid stomach troubles, and so forth... . Naturopaths prescribe megavitamins and herbs, either of which may function as drugs, belying the claim that their therapies are \"drugless\" or benign. Naturopaths tend to emphasize colonics based upon the discredited nineteenth century \"intestinal toxicity\" theory. NCAHF Position Paper on Chiropractic, supra note 68.

All advocate the use of \"all natural foods,\" grown without the use of pesticides or chemical fertilizers and prepared without added sugar, starch, salt, artificial coloring, or preservatives. These diets may be supplemented with megadoses of vitamins ... laetrile, minerals, enzymes, amino acids, and oxygen generating chemicals.

Cultural and religious practices will affect the types of health care practice that patients will seek, such as folk medicine or other nontraditional alternatives. Consequently, studies on health care providers have shown that there are cultural and ethnic differences in what types of services are used by patients. When minorities do seek care, poor communication may undermine care if majority health care professionals do not understand other cultures' deference to authority, descriptions of pain, and world views about wellness and illness. See Watson, Race, Ethnicity & Hospital Care, supra note 92. Often, because of culturally insensitive delivery of health care, no effort is made by health care professionals to interact with the patient effectively. 94 See Park, supra note 50, at 24. 95 Because I focus on nonproven alternative therapies, I assume that the physician has no obligation under the doctrine of informed consent to offer the treatments to patients as a viable choice of care. 96 See generally Capron, supra note 44 (discussing the importance and difficulties of physician disclosure in obtaining informed consent for treatment of catastrophic disease); King & Henderson, supra note 44, at 1032-50 (discussing physicians' responsibility to disclose experimental treatments to patients in obtaining informed consent). 97 See King & Henderson, supra note 44, at 1040. 98 See id. at 1041. 99 See generally King, supra note 40 (arguing for the elimination of the distinction between experiment and treatment and for physicians to use \"meaningful justification\" instead of recommendations to patients). 100 See King & Henderson, supra note 44, at 1041-46. 101 See King, supra note 40, at 8 (noting that research regulation substantially derives from concerns \"that physician-researchers may deliberately or inadvertently misrepresent their intent,\" with patients unwittingly becoming research subjects). 102 The controversy centered on whether AIDS patients, whose disease at the time was inevitably fatal and for which treatment was unknown, could obtain accelerated access to unapproved drugs. See George J. Annas, AIDS, Judges, and the Right to Medical Care, HASTINGS CENTER REP., Aug.-Sept. 1988, at 20, 22. At the time, large numbers of AIDS patients were smuggling experimental drugs into the country from Mexico, Europe and Japan in their search for anything that offered hope.

Managed Care Organizations Begin Covering Alternative Treatment, supra note 9, at 3. Eisenberg warns that medical doctors have been sued for malpractice as a result of administering unproven treatments, but observes that extant case law fails to guide physicians who desire to provide or refer patients to receive alternative health care. See Eisenberg, supra note 114, at 61. Eisenberg himself outlines a strategy for physicians to follow in supervising a patient's alternative medical treatments. See id. at 62-65. 117 Members of Blue Cross managed care plans in Washington and Alaska must seek a referral to an alternative practitioner from their gatekeeper primary care physician. See Weber, supra note 1, at 18. 118 Nancy King observes: Whereas patients and physicians prefer the physician's individual therapeutic intuition to govern insurer reimbursement decisions, insurers are increasingly attempting to curb their responsibility to pay for treatments that are often both extremely costly and unlikely to succeed by seeking to apply more \"scientific\" definitions and standards of acceptability. King, supra note 40, at 8. Michael Cohen argues that alternative/complementary medicine should not be treated as experimental therapies by third-party payers.

Ct. 1997) (upholding negligence verdict against alternative practitioner who persuaded plaintiff to forgo chemotherapy in favor of special diet and coffee enemas). The potential for malpractice liability may not serve as much of a deterrent to offering nonvalidated or invalidated alternative therapies if the physician scrupulously adheres to informed consent requirements and the applicable state law allows assumption of the risk doctrine to act as a complete bar to causation. See, e.g., Boyle v. Revici, 961 F.2d 1060, 1063 (2d Cir. 1992) (finding that the issue of express assumption of risk, which bars recovery, should have been submitted to the jury). See generally Vincler & Nicol, supra note 32, at 166 (noting that the assumption of risk is a more appropriate analytical model than informed consent because complementary and alternative medicine therapies pose unknown risks). 141 Nancy King notes: Not only is the \"gold standard\" of the [randomized control trial] disputed; it may even be outmoded. The promise of genetic medicine is turning us toward individually tailored treatments that are ill-suited to conventional evaluation through research. The stakes are high and getting higher in experimental treatment; \"hard facts\" about safety and efficacy are harder to come by as the standards for the introduction of new therapies change, changing researchers' ability to collect data. Perhaps, then, it is time to address more systematically the role of the scientific method in medicine .... King, supra note 40, at 12. See generally Benjamin Freedman et al., Placebo Orthodoxy in Clinical Research I: Empirical and Methodological Myths, 24 J.L.

Larry Dossey, M.D., who edits Alternative Therapies, concurs: While the double-blind method of evaluation may be applicable to certain alternative therapies ... it is inappropriate for perhaps the majority of them. Many alternative interventions are unlike drugs and surgical procedures. Their action is affected by factors that cannot be specified, quantified, and controlled in double-blind designs. Everything that counts can not be counted. To subject alternative therapies to sterile, impersonal, double-blind conditions strips them of intrinsic qualities that are part of their power. New forms of evaluation will have to be developed if alternative therapies are to be fairly assessed.
