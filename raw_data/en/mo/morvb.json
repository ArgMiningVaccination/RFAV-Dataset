The average age of a cover girl model is 23-24 years old. Gray hair, wrinkles, and sagging skin are the visible markers of being \"old.\" While you know in your heart appearance is not the whole of you, there is a nagging realization that looks are associated with success and status. The issue of losing attractiveness is about becoming irrelevant, passed over, and even worse\u2014invisible. Cosmetic surgery and procedures are scary and play upon the fears of not being good enough. The pressure to do something is enormous, and the boom in plastic surgery and anti-aging cosmetics take advantage of this emotional vulnerability. Plastic surgery offers a large variety of solutions, but they are costly and invasive and come with health risks, pain, and recovery time. Perhaps some of your friends and colleagues have done procedures, but the idea of plastics and neurotoxins being injected into your face is not appealing (at least it wasn't to me). There is the possibility that you won't look like you. Worse is the possibility that people will know you did something and judge you as insecure, vain, or superficial. Many professional and successful women confess that if they knew about a natural alternative, they would go for that instead. An Eastern Medicine Alternative Eastern medicine recognizes that our physical, emotional, and spiritual health shines through our face and skin. While we may believe that youth is beauty, the truth is that health is beauty. Facial-rejuvenation acupuncture is a safe, painless, and non-surgical method of reducing the signs of aging. This alternative is a revitalization process that not only helps your face look its best, but helps your whole body look and feel younger. Yes, facial-rejuvenation acupuncture does work. [Schedule your all-natural beauty solution today.](http://info.integrativehealingarts.com/facial-rejuvenation-acupuncture/) How Facial Rejuvenation Works Acupuncture for facial rejuvenation is a safe, painless, non-surgical acupuncture facelift. It is an ancient method used to slow and reverse the signs of aging. Acupuncture is a tradition of healing from the East that has been developing for 2,500 years. It is a part of a medicine system that treats the whole person (body, mind, and spirit). A course of Acupuncture Facial Rejuvenation treatments will address the whole body's health and the underlying causes of aging, as well as the surface signs of stress and aging that show up on the face. This means that your skin will not only look younger, it will actually be healthier. Essentially, as improvements are made to your body, the effects are radiance and a beautiful, lasting afterglow in your face. Benefits of Acupuncture Facial Rejuvenation - Stimulates collagen production, which increases facial elasticity and fills in wrinkles - Moisturizes and nourishes your skin by increasing local circulation of blood and lymph - Tightens pores - Brightens the eyes - Improves hormonal balance to help acne problems and reduce stress - Reduces fine lines by increasing your body's production of collagen - Reduces your jowls and lifts drooping eyelids by encouraging dermal contractions - Softens and fills the so-called smile lines and frown lines - Lifts droopy eyelids - Minimizes double chins \"The wow factor is back.

'Did you lose weight or do something different? You look amazing!' You can reply, 'I'm healthier than I've ever been before, and it shows in my face.'\" When to Start Treatments Skin damage and the aging process begin long before visible signs of aging appear.

I looked a little droopy and saggy in some areas. I wanted to try something noninvasive to give my face a boost. I knew that acupuncture was effective because I had received great results from acupuncture for back pain and nerve problems. I got better sleep and it relieved my stress. \"The results from facial rejuvenation surpassed my expectations. Not only did it address the drooping and sagging, but the treatments also evened my skin tone, improved its elasticity, and smoothed the texture. The creases disappeared, and I looked 10 years younger. Then, when I saw the radiant beauty program, I immediately recognized the added benefit of the detox because it is very important for the skin as well as the whole body.\" \"The results were that not just my facial skin, but also my whole body is more toned and radiant. People notice. Perfect strangers have walked up to me and said, 'Your skin looks amazing.' I recommend this program to anyone who is health- conscious, wants to look their best, and wants to be able to look in the mirror and see the reflection of a more youthful version of themselves. This is not artificial beauty.\" Ann R., NYC "}
