Between working with the public, having a toddler in daycare ( can we say germ-fest?), and journeying to the grocery store and touching those delightfully contaminated carts, I can't seem to avoid the sickening. If you're anything like me, you're in the same boat. So, when you're on the up and up and starting to feel better but need that little help over the hump, an herbal wrap can be a nourishing, new way to get your immune system back in commission. A step in the right direction toward your self-care journey, an herbal wrap warms you to the core and can boost your energy. Though new to many people, herbal wraps are quite delightful and healing. At The Pearl, you start with an aromatherapy steam infused with your choice of essential oil (Eucalyptus, Rosemary, Lavender, Tangerine, Basil, or Lemongrass). Our quaint steam shower increases circulation, letting you flush out toxins and get an all over, head-to-toe warm-up. The steam also warms the body from the outside to the inside, allowing you to continue to stay warm, sometimes for hours after your treatment. Though we don't recommend a steam when you already have a fever, a steam creates an \"artificial fever\" in the body, which is said to bolster your immune response. A tailored blend of herbs is steeped in a hot water bath, then cloth sheets are soaked in the warm \"tea\" in preparation for enveloping your body in a cocoon of herbs. We have options, depending on your individual needs, which include the following: The Herbal Wrap is relaxing, hydrating, balancing, and re-mineralizing. This treatment is great for boosting the immune system and speeding the metabolism. This wrap is our most detoxifying. Breathe Easy Herbal Wrap A must during the seasonal changes in weather as this will boost your immune system and decongest your respiratory system. Mud Wrap Beneficial for joint pain and inflammation as well as boosting metabolic activity. This wrap uses organic thermal mineral marine mud combined with the essential oils to create an uplifting, oxygenating and healing quality. Mint Magic Herbal Wrap This treatment is uplifting and energizing. This is a full body wrap in muslin sheets infused with spearmint, peppermint, savory and lavender. Tummy Tamer Herbal Wrap An herbal wrap treatment that is both detoxifying and supportive to the digestive system. All herbs and essential oils in this treatment aid in the digestion process and help to cleanse the digestive tract and tame excited stomachs. Seaweed Wrap Total body contour slimming treatment for individuals in need of detoxifying and re-mineralizing. This wrap is slimming, clarifying, and mineralizing. You then enjoy aromatherapy. Eucalyptus, which can your respiratory system, helps aid in the clearing of nasal passageways. And Rosemary, which can aid in lowering cortisol. Managing our cortisol levels is a helpful tool, because when we are more rested and less stressed, we're more likely to heal faster and avoid illness. You then get a healing and stimulating head, face, shoulder, and d\u00e9collet\u00e9 massage. Massage of the face and base of head, especially, support opening and release of sinus discomfort due to their reflexive properties. To end, you will take a cleansing shower followed by a head-to-toe application of Sacred Earth moisturizing cream, then hopefully retire to the relaxing lounge to enjoy one of our delicious antioxidant teas, which further aid in your relaxation. When I have the pleasure of giving an Herbal Wrap to a client, it's so delightful and satisfying to see them so deeply relaxed and detoxified. Personally, when I receive an Herbal Wrap I feel the penetrating healing qualities for many days after my treatment. I feel less bloated, my skin is smoother, my energy feels improved, I usually sleep quite well that night, and I just feel very warm and nurtured.
