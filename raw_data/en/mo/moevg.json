Haggbloom, Department Head Rick Grieve, Clinical M.A. Concentration Coordinator Carl Myers, Ed.S. Program Coordinator Sharon Mutter, Experimental M.A. Concentration Coordinator Betsy Shoenfelt, Industrial/Organizational M.A. Concentration Coordinator I. Departmental Context A. Mission and Goals The primary mission of the Department of Psychology is to provide students with a strong education in the theoretical, scientific, and applied study of psychology. Accordingly, the Department's Action Plan objectives under Goal 1: Increasing Student learning are: Provide learning and student engagement opportunities that prepare undergraduate students for employment and/or graduate school or professional school Provide learning and student engagement opportunities that prepare graduate students for employment and/or further graduate training or professional school Increase teaching effectiveness Provide opportunities consistent with Western's Quality Enhancement Plan for student engagement in the discipline and for civic engagement To accomplish these goals, the Department has developed well-articulated student learning outcomes and associated assessment plans for all programs and uses assessment results to improve its programs. Moreover, the Department performance appraisal system evaluate s three dimensions of effective teaching: planning, delivery, and student assessment. Documented excellence in teaching is recognized with merit pay and is an essential component of successful applications for tenure and promotion in rank. Many Department faculty members regularly participate in teaching- and advising -related professional development activities, and the research programs of several facu lty focus on ways to improve teach ing and student learning. Since the Department's last Academic Program Review in 1997, five faculty members have received the College of Education and Behavioral Sciences Faculty Award for Teaching and two have received the College Faculty Award for Advising. A second component of the Department mission is the advancement of psychology and psychological knowledge by conducting basic and applied research, publishing in professional journals, and presenting at professional conferences. Faculty performance in fulfillin g this aspect of the Department mission is recognized and rewarded with merit pay and is an important compone nt of successful applications for tenure and promotion in rank. Since the Department's previous Program Review, six faculty members have received the CEBS Faculty Award for Research /Creativity, and four received the Univer sity Award for Res earch/Creativity. To enhance the Department's research capacity a nd create a focus on facult y strengths in life-span developmental psychology, the Department established the WKU Center for the Study of Life-Span Development which was approved by the Board of Rege nts in spring, 2004. In addition, the Department renovated space in Tate page Hall during the 2004-05 aca demic year to create research labs for five junior faculty members. 2 The third component of the Department's mission is to improve the lives of others through application of knowledge and expertise in psychology, practice of the profession of psychology, and regional stewardship activities that provide faculty professional expertise to community groups, schools, and public and private organizations, and to provide service and leadership w ithin the University and professional organizations. Significant and professionally relevant service activities ar e recognized with merit pay and are important in the evaluation of faculty for tenure and promotion in rank. During the period covered by this review, five Department of Psychology faculty members have received the CEBS Faculty Award for Public Service, and one received the University Award. To increase the Department's capacity to serve the community through practice of the profession of psychology, the Department's training clinic was establishe d as a fee-for-services clinic in fall, 2004. The clinic accepts referrals from the University Counseling an d Testing Center (at no charge) and from community psychologists and physicians (on a sliding scale). One measure of the success of the Department of Ps ychology in fulfilling its mission and goals, meeting the objectives set forth in its annual Action Plan, and cont ributing to the strategic mission and priority initiatives of the University is the fact that the Department was recognized with a top-tier Unit Productivity Award in each of the 5 years from AY 2000-01 through AY 2005-06, and a second-tier award in each of the 3 years prior to AY 2000-01. B. Programs At the undergraduate level, the Department offers the Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and a minor in psychology. The Master of Arts degree in psychology, and the Education Specialist degree in school psychology are offered at the graduate level. General Major (reference #760) . This program comprises 36 credit hours in psychology and a minor or second major. There are five required courses, five cour ses selected from categories of restricted electives (one from each category), and two elective psychology courses. Students are ad vised to take PSY 175 University Experience. Extended Major (reference #591) . This program comprises 51 credit hours in psychology with no minor or second major required. Students are expected to maintain a 2.50 GPA both overall and in psychology. There are five required courses, seven courses selected from cat egories of restricted electiv es (one from each category), and five elective psychology courses. The two additional restricted electiv e categories ensure students have either a field experience or research experience and an applied course. Students are advised to take PSY 175 University Experience. Minor (reference #438) . The psychology minor requires 21 credits hours in psychology including PSY 100. At least 12 credit hours must be upper division. Master of Arts in Psychology (reference #092) . This program requires 48 graduate credit hours in psychology including four core course s, one course from each of three cat egories of restricted electives, 6-9 credit hours of practicum and/or internship, and additional required and elective courses specified by each of the four concentrations: clinical psychology, experimental psychology, general psychology, and industrial/organizational psychology. Clinical Concentration . This concentration follows the scientist/p ractitioner model of training and prepares students to be successful at performi ng both research and therapy. The prog ram is practice oriented, offering a broad foundation for the professional who will provide a wide variety of psychological services at the M.A. level in mental health centers, rehabilitation centers, colle ge counseling centers, and various other mental health agencies. The program also prepares students for continuation in a Ph.D. program and to take the licensing examine required to practice psychology in many states. 3 Experimental Concentration . This concentration is designed to prepare students for positions where strong research and methodological skills are needed and/ or for continuation in a Ph.D. program. Research opportunities are available in cognition, perception, child development, gerontology, social psychology, sport psychology, and educational psychology. Strong training in statistical and methodological skills is provided. General Concentration . This concentration is designed for students who desire a terminal master's degree in psychology or who plan to pursue doctoral studies in specialties other than clinical, experimental, or industrial/organizational psychology . Industrial/Organizational Concentration . This concentration is designed fo r students seeking preparation as M.A. psychologists in business, industry, service organizations, consulting firms, or government agencies. The objective of the program is the development of marketable skills in the areas of test construction and validation, personnel selection and placement, performance appraisa l, and training. Instructio n in the areas of work motivation, job satisfaction, and organizational development is also provided. The program adheres to a scientist/practitioner model of training. Students learn to evaluate and apply theory and research. In particular, the program is designed to train personnel specialists. Educational Specialist Degree in School Psychology (reference #147) . This program emphasizes the development of students as innovative problem solvers in a school setting. Students are trained to make an integral contribution to the total progra m of pupil services. Each individual receives on-site experience in public schools, school related practicum assignments in the Department's psychological clinic, and experience as a member of an interdisciplinary team. The program requires 75 graduate credit hours including four core courses, 9 hours of Educational Foundation courses, 17 hours of assessment courses, 12 hours of intervention courses, an ethics course, 10 hours of statistics and research methodology courses, a 6 credit-hour internship, and a 6 credit-hour specialist project. II. Departmental Enrollment, Faculty, and Resource Data (Trends in student credit hour production, average class size, and utilizat ion of full-time and part-time faculty) Table 1: Student Credit Hours Produced (SCHP) Fall 2001 Fall 2002 Fall 2003 Fall 2004 Fall 2005 TOTAL SCHP 10226 10895 number of studen ts enrolled in a course by the credit hours offered for the course. (e.g., 30 students enrolled in a three-credit hour course would be equivalent to 90 SCHP.) On-Campus includes courses taught at WKU's main and south campuses. Extended Campus includes courses taught in Glasgow, Elizabethtown, and Owens boro. Distance Learning includes all other courses, including correspondence, Web, KVU, SPAN course s and courses taught at special locations. A. Enrollment Trends Western's total Student credit hours produced (SCHP) increased 14% from 2001 to 2005. SCHP in the Department of Psychology outpaced th at growth, steadily increasing from 10,226 to 12,129 (19%) over the same period. Most of the Psychology SCHP increase took place on the main campus (1,215 SCHP, or 14%), and that growth exceeded bo th the total main campus SCHP increase of only 9% and the main campus College 4of Education and Behavioral Sciences increase of only 6%. Most of the main campus increase in Psychology SCHP was at the undergraduate level (1,110 SCHP, (14%). [These data were obtained from the 2006 Fact Book and from fall 2001 and fall 2005 Faculty Workload Reports. There are slight discrepancies between the workload data, Fact Book data, and the data provided by Institutional Research for this program revi ew, but those discrepancies are too small to impact the percentages reported here.] The growth trend in undergraduate SCHP can be attributed to a combination of Western's enrollment growth, the popularity of psychology general education courses, and the popularity of psychology as a major (the General Psychology Major is the fifth most popular major at Western, and psychology is the third most popular major if enrollment in the General and Extended Majors is combined). A recent national survey that asked prospective college students to indicate their ex pected major found that 4. 6% selected psychology. Psychology tied with elementary education as the most po pular major with biology a close second at 4.5%. No other major came close to those values. On the assumption that overall enrollment will continue to increase, Psychology should continue to experience increased SCHP. The 14% increase in Psychology main-campus gradua te SCHP is largely attributable to new hires, especially of faculty who primarily support the clini cal M.A. concentration. Fr om 2001 to 2003, that concentration was understaffed and was not admitting a full complement of graduate students. Some of the growth may also be attributable to increased demand (e.g., from alternative route to certification programs) for graduate-level educational psychology courses that satisfy requirements for various M.A.E. and graduate certificate programs. However, there are two major constraints on further growth in main-campus graduate SCHP. First, the Department's M.A. and Ed.S. programs are full-time residential programs that admit a limited number of students through a competitive process. Those programs have been operating at near capacity now for several years. Capacity is largely limited by the nu mber of students faculty can effectively supervise for internships, practica, research experiences, and theses. On the other hand, there is considerable potential for SCHP growth in graduate-level educational psychology courses, but this growth is constrained by not having enough faculty to meet the demand for courses, especi ally online courses (where much of the demand is). Online courses benefit students who cannot travel to campus, but limit SCHP because of smaller enrollment caps. Although the total Psychology SCHP increase was greatest on the main campus, the rate of growth was markedly higher at the Elizabethtow n/Ft. Knox, Glasgow, and Owensboro extended campus sites (37%). The 37% increase in extended campus Psychology SCHP greatly exceeded the total extended campus SCHP increase of only 4% across all disciplines ( 2006 Fact Book , pp. 46-47). Undergraduate Psychology SCHP at extended campus sites increased from 999 to 1,632 (63%). On the other hand, graduate SCHP decreased from 243 to 147 (-40%). The substantial growth in extended campus undergraduate SCHP, like the growth on the main campus, was also likely fueled by overall enrollment growth, the popularity of psychology general education courses, and the popularity of psychology as a major. In addition, howeve r, the Department hired a full-time faculty member for the Glasgow site in 2001, and hired a full-time faculty member for the Elizabethtown/Ft. Knox site in 2003. Both of these individuals hold the Ph.D. and were trained as experimental psychologists. Consequently, they are qualified to offer an array of undergraduate courses that the part-time clinical psychologists teaching at those sites are not qu alified to teach. Moreover, these faculty members created a full-time presence for psychology in Glasgow and Elizabethtown which may well have contributed to student interest. Indeed, there is sufficient student interest now at both sites that a psychology club was established in fall 2005 in Elizabethtown and will likely be establishe d in Glasgow in the current academic year. The addition of permanent full-time faculty to the Glasgow and Elizabethtown sites also allowed for the development of a curriculum rotation plan which, combined with online and ITV courses, has allowed the Department to make the 36-credit hour General Major completely available at all three extended campus sites. The fact that students can now complete the psychology major at the extended campus sites is very likely another contributor to the substantial increase in Psychology extended campus undergraduate SCHP. The decreased graduate SCHP at the extended campus sites (-40%) can be attributed to efforts to accommodate student demand for online educational psyc hology courses. Distance learning SCHP at the graduate level increased from 141 to 249 in 2005 (77%). The Department's online graduate course offerings are 5exclusively educational psychology cour ses and are, of course, accessible to students who might otherwise have taken a traditional course at one of the extended campus sites. The undergraduate distance learning SCHP increased from only 78 in 2001 to 324 in 2005 (315%). B. Utilization of Full and Part-Time Faculty The percentage of SCHP generated by full-time faculty decreased from 66% in 2001 to 51% by 2003, but then recovered to 62% for 2004 and 2005. That decrease and recovery paralleled a decrease and subsequent increase in the availab ility of full-time faculty for teaching assignments. The Department had 31 budgeted FTE faculty in 2001 (see Table 3 below), but 2.25 FTE faculty were bought out by extramural grants and 2.75 FTE faculty had administrative reassignments outside the Department effectively reducing the number of FTE faculty from 31 to 26. That situation worsened in 2002 with 2.75 FTE faculty bought out by grants, 3.0 FTE faculty with administrative r eassignments, and one faculty member on sabbatical. Thus, although the Department still had 31 budgeted FTE faculty, the number available for teaching assignments was further reduced to 24.25. At the same time, enrollment growth created more demand for classes. In 2003, a late resignation and the appointm ent of Dr. Poe as associate dean further reduced the number of budgeted FTE faculty from 31 to 29. After adjusting for grant buyouts and administrative reassignments outside the Department, the number of full-time faculty was effectively reduced to 23.25 while continuing overall enrollment growth created increased demand for classes. However, seven new hires brought the 2004 budgeted FTE faculty to 33 and an additional hire brought the 2005 total to 34. These increases were accompanied by an appropriate and corresponding decrease in the reliance on part- time faculty. C. Table 2: Average Class Size for Lower Division, Upper Division, and Graduate Courses Division Fall 2001 Fall 2002 Fall 2003 Fall 2004 Fall 2005 Lower 41 40 41 40 43 Upper 25 25 25 24 25 Graduate 13 13 13 15 15 Lower division consists of 0-299 level courses, upper division consists of 300-499 level courses, and graduate courses consist of 500+ level courses. All 400G course counts are rolled up under their respective master 400-level section. Excludes applied music, co op, independent study, internship, correspondence, research, and maintaining matriculation courses. The average class size remained essentially constant from 2001 through 2005 within each division. Class sizes within each division are considered appr opriate relative to the instructional demands at each level. D.

Department Heads and Optional Retirees count as 0.5 FTE faculty members. Includes vacant positions. Excludes temporary full-time positions and regular full-time positions not yet budgeted. During the period covered by this review, eight full-time faculty members began optional retirement, one moved to a one-half-time position in the Dean's offi ce, and another left the De partment to be associate dean. There was also a marked increase in grant activity beginning in fall 2001 with two faculty members having a 50% grant buyout and one having a 75% buyout for 2001 through 2005. However, the Department was very successful in making high quality hires during this period. Five new full-time faculty members 6were hired for fall 2001. Four of these were tenure-track and one was a continuing instructor permanently stationed at the Glasgow extended campus site. There was one new hire each in 2002 and 2003, followed by seven in 2004. Of the seven new faculty hired in 2004, five were tenure-track and two were continuing instructors. One of the continuing instructors is permanently stationed at the Elizabethtown extended campus site. There was one additional new hire in fa ll 2005. All of these new faculty members, including the continuing instructors, have appropriate doctoral degrees.

Professor 5 5 3 8 8 Instructor 3 3 3 5 5 No Rank 0 0 0 0 0 Total Full-time 28 31 27 33 33 The distribution of faculty by rank is well balanced. Of the 17 new hires made from the last Academic Program review in 1997 through 2005, four were hired as continuing instructors, 11 were hired as tenure-track assistant professors, and two were hired as te nure-track associate profes sors. The Department has clearly defined, faculty-developed promotion and tenure cr iteria, and takes steps to ensure that tenure-track faculty members understand the level of performance expected of them in order to earn tenure and promotion. Faculty development and progress toward tenure and promotion are supported by a mentoring system, a thorough third-year review of progress toward tenure, and detailed annual performance evaluations that provide a cumulative assessment of performance up through and including the most recent review period. The result of these proactive efforts to ensure faculty success and progress toward meeting tenure and promotion criteria has been that Department of Psychology faculty are generally successful in obtaining tenure and make timely progress in obtaining promotion in rank.

Table 6: Student Credit Hours per Full Time Equivalent Faculty Fall 2001 Fall 2002 Fall 2003 Fall 2004 Fall 2005 SCHP/FTEF 334 334 333 336 346 SCHP is calculated by multiplying the number of studen ts enrolled in a course by the credit hours offered for the course. (e.g., 30 students enrolled in a three-credit hour course would be equivalent to 90 SCHP.) FTEF is calculated according to WORKLOAD definitions: 1 FTEF= 9 credit hours per semester for GFCOB, 15 credit hours per semester for CC and 12 credit hours per semester for all others. SCHP per full-time faculty was essentially constant for the period of this review. The Department strives to strike an appropriate balance among peda gogically effective class sizes, reassigned time for research and creative activity, and reliance on full-time versus part-time faculty. F. Table 7: FTE Part-time Faculty Fall 2001 Fall 2002 Fall 2003 Fall 2004 Fall 2005 Part-time FTEF 10.00 12.50 15.00 13.25 14.00 FTEF is calculated according to WORKLOAD definitions: 1 FTEF= 9 credit hours per semester for GFCOB, 15 credit hours per semester for CC and 12 credit hours per semester for all others. Part-time FTE faculty increased from 2001 to 2005 . However, on the main campus, FTEF part-time faculty remained relatively constant du ring the period of this review w ith part-time faculty teaching a total of 76 credit hours in 2001 and 81 credit hours in 2005 (these figures exclude part-time faculty teaching online classes). Six of those credit hours in 2005 were dual-credit courses taught by part-time faculty hired by DELO. Minus those six credit hours, there was esse ntially no change in part-time FTEF on the main campus. The increase in part-time FTEF occurred at the extended campus sites to accommodate enrollment 8growth. In 2001, part-time faculty taught 42 credit ho urs at extended campus site s. By 2005, that number had grown to 66. G. Table 8: Student/Faculty Ratio Fall 2001 Fall 2002 Fall 2003 Fall 2004 Fall 2005 Student/Faculty Ratio 22:1 22:1 22:1 22:1 22:1 Student/Faculty Ratio is calculated as FTES/FTEF . 1 FTES= Undergraduate SCHP/16 or Graduate SCHP/12. FTEF is calculated accord ing to WORKLOAD definitions: 1 F TEF= 9 credit hours per semester for GFCOB, 15 credit hours per semester for CC and 12 credit hours per semester for all others. The student/faculty ratio remained constant for the period of this review, and is just slightly higher than the University-wide student/faculty ratio of 18 :1. The somewhat higher student/faculty ratio in Psychology is largely attributable to the demand for PSY 100 Introduction to Psychology, a very popular general education course. In order to efficiently acco mmodate that demand, most PSY 100 class sizes are relatively large. For example, in fall 2005 there were 10 sections capped at 52, and five sections capped at 138, each of which was full on the first day of classes. The smaller sections are actually capped at two more students than the classroom seats, and the large sectio ns are capped at about eight more students than the classroom seats. This \"overbooking\" strategy accomm odates the normal early se mester attrition from PSY 100 without the need to offer an additional s ection just to meet the registration demand. H. Table 9: Total Budget and 2001/02 2005/06 expenses. The figures include every expense and encumbrance charged against the corresponding cost cent er. This would include salary, benefits, operating, travel, capital, etc. No expe nse category has been excluded. * Preliminary. Table 9 suggests that the Department spent less than was budgeted each y ear from 2001/02 through 2005/06 by an amount ranging from $154,611 to $331,088 (mean = $217,531). This is, of course, completely inaccurate. The Department always spends the operating budget down to near zero by the end of every fiscal year, and the oper ating budget is then supplemented by Unit Productivity Award Funds, indirect funds generated by extern al grants, and foundation accounts. Ta ble 9 most likely reflects end-of- year budget adjustments, primarily to the salary budg et, to accommodate the use of grant-related salary savings to support graduate assistantship stipends. An explanation and corrected figures for Table 9 were requested from Institutional Research on Oc tober 3, 2006, but were never received. I. Table 10: Ratio of Total for the fiscal year, while SCHP are for the fall and spring semesters combined. The figures include every expense and encumbrance charged against the corresponding cost center. This would include salary, benefits, operating, travel, capital, etc. No expense category has been excluded. *Preliminary Expenditures/SCHP should increase somewhat over tim e as faculty salaries increase and new faculty lines are created. However, expenditures/SCHP from 2001-02 to 2005-06 increased only 13% while SCHP increased 18%. Moreover, the Depart ment of Psychology ratio remains less than the University ratio. Finally, it should be noted that total expenditures/SCHP is a rather peculiar measure. Psychology has extra 9financial resources generated by successful fundraisi ng, the receipt of Unit Productivity Awards, and extramural funding that generates indirect cost paym ents from funding agencies. These additional financial resources are used to provide enhanced support for faculty scholarship and travel to professional conferences. Such expenditures are only tangentially re lated to SCHP cost and departments in a position to make such expenditures will have artificially inflat ed SCHP costs. Consequently, between-department comparisons are not very meaningful. J. Table 11: Total Student Credit Hours Produced in Winter and Summer Terms SCHP 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 SUMMER SCHP increased from 2002 through 2004 and then decreased slightly in 2005 and substantially in 2006. The recent drop in summer SCHP is not attributable to any change in the availability of classes either on the main campus or at the exte nded campus sites. Rather, in 2005, and to an even greater extent in 2006, classes were cancelled for low enrollment that in previous summers had substantial enrollment. The recent drop in summer enrollment appears to be co nsistent with a University-wide trend. III. Qualifications and Credentials of Departmental Faculty A.

Participation of Faculty in Multiple Programs within the Department or Other Departments Dr. Joyce Wilder teaches one-half time for the De partment of psychology an d one-half time for the Department of Communication Disorders (although her entire salary line is in the Department of Psychology). Information about faculty participation in multiple programs within the Department of Psychology was presented in Table 5 above. E. Number/Utilization of Part-time Faculty Main Campus . In fall 2001, main campus SCHP by part-tim e faculty was 2,549, or 30% of the total main campus SCHP of 8,488. Doctoral-level instructors produced 1,254 SCHP, or 49% of that total, and most of that 1,254 SCHP (78% ) was produced by faculty on optional retirement and faculty who hold rank in the Department but whose salary line is in another unit. The remaining 1,295 SCHP (51% of the part-time total) was produced by master's-level instructors with at least 18 graduate semester-hours in psychology. Only 132 part-time facu lty SCHP were at the graduate level (all taught by doctoral-level instructors), and only 1,035 part-time faculty SCHP (41%) were from undergraduate courses that fulfilled requirements for the undergraduate major or minor. Of those 1,035 part-time faculty SCHP, 1,005 (97%) were from courses taught by doctoral level instructors, well within SACS guidelines. In fall 2005, main campus SCHP by part-time faculty was 3,132, or 32% of the total main campus SCHP of 9703, up from 30% in 2001. Doctoral-lev el instructors produced 1,122 SCHP, or 36% of the part-time faculty total (down from 49% in 2001), but as in 2001, most of that 1,122 doctoral-level SCHP (91%) was by faculty on optional retirement and faculty who hold rank in the Department but whose salary line is in another unit. The overall decrease in part-time faculty SC HP by doctoral-level faculty is largely attributable to having fewer faculty on optional retirement in 2005 than in 2001. The remaining 2,010 SCHP (64% of the 2005 part-time faculty total) was generated by non-d octoral-level instructors with at least a master's degree and/or 18 graduate semester hours in psychology. Only 132 part-time faculty SCHP (4% of the total 2005 part-time faculty SCHP) were at the graduate leve l, the same as in 2001. There were 1,575 part-time faculty SCHP from courses that fulfilled requirements fo r the undergraduate major or minor. This is 50% of the total part-time faculty SCHP and up by 9% from the corresponding 41% figure in 2001. Of those 1,575 SCHP, 1,038 (66%) were from classes taught by doctoral-level instructors. This is down from 97% in 2001, but still well within SACS guidelines. The Department supports part-time faculty with shar ed office space, computer support with internet access, and professional development resources and workshops. The pr ofessional development opportunities have included access to American Psychological Associ ation books containing tips and classroom demonstrations, a subscription to Teaching of Psychology, and invitations to various teaching workshops organized and sponsored by the Department. 12Extended Campus . In fall 2001, extended campus SCHP by part-time faculty was 786, or 59% of the total extended campus SCHP of 1,329. Only 243 part- time faculty SCHP were at the graduate level (all taught by doctoral-level instructors). Of the 543 part-time faculty SCHP at the undergraduate level, only 249 were from undergraduate courses that fulfilled requirements for the undergraduate major or minor. Of those 249 SCHP, 225 (90%) were from courses taught by doctoral-level instructors, well within SACS guidelines. All extended campus courses not taught by doctoral-level instructors were taught by part-time faculty with at least a master's degree and 18 graduate semester hours in psychology. In fall 2005, extended campus SCHP by part-time faculty was 1044, or 57% of the total extended campus SCHP of 1,819, essentially unchanged from the corresponding value of 59% in 2001. Only 147 part-time faculty SCHP were at the graduate level, all taught by doctoral-level instructors. Of the 897 part-time faculty SCHP at the undergraduate level, only 537 were from undergrad uate courses that fulfilled requirements for the undergraduate major or minor. Of those 537 SCHP, 309 (57%) were from courses taught by doctoral level instructors. That is down from 90% in 20 01, but is still well within SACS guidelines. Online Courses . In fall 2001, part-time faculty taught two online undergraduate courses that generated 78 SCHP. In fall 2005, part-time faculty taught seven online courses. Four of those were undergraduate courses and generated 255 SCHP, and three were graduate courses that generated 180 SCHP. F.

Special Qualifications of any Facult y Member (Full or Part Time) Whose Credentials do not Meet SACS Guidelines fo r the Level and/or Discipline in which they are Teaching Scott Shadrick taught Psy 505 Statistical Software for Behavioral Scientists for the Department of Psychology in the fall 2003, 2004, and 2005 semesters. Mr. Shadrick held an M.A. degree in psychology from WKU and has done an excellent job for us teaching an undergraduate psychology course on a regular basis. However, he did not meet the SACS requireme nt for teaching at the grad uate level of an earned doctorate/terminal degree in the teaching discipline or a related discipline. He was, however, nearing the completion of his doctorate at Indiana State University (and has now successfully defended his dissertation). His principal qualif ication for teaching PSY 505, whic h emphasizes the use of SPSS data analysis software, is his considerable expertise work ing with this statistical software package in his research position with the Army Resear ch Institute in Ft. Knox. In additio n, Mr. Shadrick took this course as part of his M.A. program of study, and has a very strong background in statistics. Due to his extensive experience, Mr. Shadrick is especia lly well-qualified to teach PSY 505. IV. Departmental Faculty Productivity A. Scholarship One component of the mission of the Department of Psychology is to contribute to the advancement of psychology and psychological knowledge by conducting basic and applied research, publishing in professional journals, and presenting at professional conferences. Department faculty are supported in these activities with reduced teach ing loads commensurate with scholarly activity, dedicated laboratory space, graduate research assistants, supplies and equipment, st atistical software support, and support for travel to professional conferences. Many conf erence presentations are now done as posters, so the Department used Unit Productivity Award funds in 2002 to purchase a poster printer to make high quality, full color, professional posters. Department funds have also been used to support professional development. This has taken the form of a Department colloquium series that has brought several prominent psychologists to campus each year to give research presentations as well as financial support for faculty to attend professional development workshops. For example, the Department paid for three faculty members to attend statistics workshops provided under the auspices of the American Psychological Association, and supported two faculty members and two research associ ates to attend a workshop at the University of Chicago on structural equa tion modeling. The Department places a hi gh value on student engagement in faculty scholarship. Table 13 shows the number publications and confer ence presentations by De partment faculty since 1998 (the most recent Academic Program Review was completed in 1997). Faculty published a total of 274 refereed journal articles, book chapters and books; gave 420 presentations at national and international conferences; gave 53 presentations at regional profe ssional conferences, and made 91 presentations at local conferences. Numerous state and local presentations that were done as service to a public or private organization (e.g. workshops) rather than at a professional conference meeting are not included in Table 13. Table 13: Number of Refereed Publicatio ns, National/International Conference Presentations, Presentations at Regional Co nferences, and Presentations at State and Local Conferences by Department of Psychology Faculty Since 1998 (Excludes faculty holding the rank of instructor for whom there are no expectat ions for scholarly produc tivity. Numbers reflect only those works on which an individual was the senior most WKU author within the Department of Psychology. Because there are many re search collaborations and co-authorships among 16faculty within the Department, some of th ese counts under-represent individual faculty productivity, but the totals represent an accurate count of faculty scholar ly productivity in the Department with no double (or trip le, etc.) counting of products.)

Descriptions of Faculty Research/Scholarly Activities (Current faculty only) Dr. Marty Bink: My research interests are in human lear ning, memory, and cognition especially as applied to education and training. While my specific research has spanned many topics within that broad interest (e.g., prospective memory, source monitoring, cognitive creativity, and collaborative cognition), my research focuses on two themes : decision processes involved in memory and the influence of the context on memory processes (especially in the contexts of generative tasks and social interaction). Of particular interest are questions of how intentions ar e represented in memory and how retrieval strategies interact with retrieval contexts (i .e., can people optimize retrieval strategies to match retrieval demands). My research in creative cognition addresses how peopl e use and adapt previous information for use in novel products. Finally, I am interested in how social interaction influences what is remembered. I engaged about 15 WKU undergraduate students in my research laboratory. Students collect and analyze data on these research topics and were involved in the dissemination process. Dr. Reagan Brown: My research includes topics in the area s of psychometrics, personnel selection, and statistics. The theme common to almost all of my re search in these areas relates to the functioning of the test, technique, or statistic given real world constraints. Psychometric-related projects frequently investigate whether a given personality test performs properly given that real test takers often attempt to distort their responses. Personnel selection projects include studies of the value of testing in a given situation. Finally, statistics-related projects involve the analysis of existing st atistics and creation of new statistics when existing ones perform poorly in prac tice. In all three areas, the field of psychology is advanced by identifying practices that appear theoreti cally sound, but are useless in practice. Students are involved in the design and execution of nearly all of the research projects. Dr. John Bruni: My research/scholarly activities are driven by three interconnected themes. First, an interest in issues related to applied research method ology (statistics, design, and measurement). I spend a great deal of time consulting on such issues both inside and outside of the university. The majority of this consulting has focused on questions concerning the eff ective use of multivariate statistics in such research areas as information processing, higher education institutional change, instrument development, accountability, etc. A related theme has been my interest in the use of correlational statistics in psychological research. I have been primarily interested in how applied research could benefit by the use of such coefficients as the dependent correlation coefficient and the multivariate-multiple correlation. Finally, since all research takes place within multiple epistemological environments , the impact of context has been a primary interest of mine. One environment that is of ma jor interest to me is that of hypothesis testing in psychological research. Dr. Joseph Cangemi: My scholarly activities began before I came to Western Kentucky University in 1998. My interest always has been dedicated to the pragmatic side of human endeavor. Between 1965 and 1968, as director of training and development for U.S. Steel Corporation in Venezuela, I experienced first hand the difficulty leaders had in dealing with people. I saw where I could make a contribution helping practitioners understand better fundamental aspects of interpersonal behavior for greater organizational harmony. Subjects such as personal power, authority, organizational behavior, healthy vs. unhealthy leadership behavior, balancing work and family life, dealing with stress successf ully, and creating healthy and creative work environments capture much of my tim e and energy. My work essentially is dedicated to the practitioner; the one who must get the work done through others. I utilize my colleagues' experimental data and translate it to those who must make use of it, who need it to help them make better decisions and become more successful. Indeed, dealing with the practitioner, to include students, is my passion. Dr. Pitt Derryberry: My research focuses on the moral development of adolescents and young adults. The research that I conduct addresses important moral developmental components such as moral judgment, moral sensitivity, and moral motivation. The knowledge that is accrued th rough my research is beneficial to psychology and the co mmunity in general because it not only facilitates our understanding of moral development overall but it can also help to inform best practices for moral education. Given the increased prevalence of immoral acts in today's world (e.g., 9/11 , Enron, school shootings, etc.), the advancement of this research area is a must. An important advantage of conducting research in this area is that it tends to 18capture the interest of others - especially students. Thus, I have been able to collaborate with colleagues and have involved a number of students as I carry out my research agenda. Dr. Rick Grieve: I have two lines of research that I am act ively examining. The first deals with eating disorders in men, specifically examining the etiological factors related to muscle dysmorphia. Muscle dysmorphia is a disorder in men that mirrors anorexia ne rvosa in that muscular men feel as though they are too small and weak and spend inordinate amounts of time trying to increase their musculature. This is a new disorder, and my research progra m will contribute to the initial conceptualization of the disorder. My second line of research deals with sport fan behaviors. I am one of a small number (10 to 15) investigators who are actively examining this area, and have been interviewed for local and national publications about sport fan behaviors. I actively engage graduate and undergraduate students in both research programs by including them in the design, implementation, analysis, and writing phases of the projects. Dr. Steve Haggbloom: My research interests are in learning, memory, cognitive aging, and the history of psychology. Dr. Lance Hahn: I am interested in the semantic relationships underlying word recognition. I use a very multidisciplinary approach that includes behavioral measures (semantic priming), computational models and constraints suggested from the neuroscience literature. The initial impact of my work will be a better understanding of how word recognition is influenced by the semantic relationships between words. My long-term objectives include the empirical study and computational modeling of group and individual differences in word recognition. An understanding of individual differences in word recognition could have a very broad impact on assessing reading skills and identifying readers with specific deficits. By using a multidisciplinary approach and having long-range objectives that are clearly relevant to education, I hope to engage a large and diverse group of students. Dr. Melissa Hakman: My research is two-fold. One area of research centers on the empirical investigation of parent-child interactions in traditional and nontraditional families, such as in cases of child maltreatment or kinship care. Caregiver variables such as perceptions, attributions, and mental health as well as child variables such as compliance and te mperament are examined to see the bidirectional influences of parental variables and child variables on parent-child interactions. A second line of research involves empirical investigation of individual and fam ily factors that contribute to adolescents' engagement in risky behavior. Information gathered from resear ch on kinship care was us ed to create 2 treatment manuals to address caregiver and child issues. Two consecutive cycles of groups have been run. Students are involved in various aspects of my research including data collection, data entry, and behavioral coding. Graduate students have also assisted with running the treatment groups under supervision. Dr. Elizabeth Jones. My research and scholarly activities are a pplied and collaborative in nature along two strands or themes. On the on e hand, I am interested in the sc holarship of teaching with specific interests in training and practice models and student outcomes in the field of early intervention and the field of experience-based learning. Current focus is on development of an assessment instrument to capture student outcomes from engagement activities (field base d placements) and development of an international service learning class with assessment of student engagement outcomes. On the other, hand I have an interest in the area of social/emotional assessment, specifically measures of de pression and adolescent limited self-injury (cutting). The phenomena of adolescen t limited self injury is escalating dramatically in the adolescent population and practicing school psychologists have a largely antiquated conceptualization that may lead to potentially harmful treatment strategies and procedures to handle the contagion aspects of this phenomena in schools. All of my research proj ects involve students at the undergraduate or graduate level and faculty from related disciplines (Interdisc iplinary Early Childhood Education, Social Work, Communication Disorders, and Special Education). Dr. Elizabeth Lemerise: My research examines the social, cognitive, and emotional underpinnings of socially competent and aggressive behavior in children. In particular, the impact of various emotion processes on children's understanding of problematic and challenging situations with peers has been examined in children who vary in both age and adjustment. A related line of research examines children's peer relationships and their contribution to children's adjustment at school. The integration of emotional 19and cognitive processes in studying children's social competence is considered to be a significant contribution to the discipline as recognized by the publication of Lemerise and Arsenio (2000) in a special issue of the prestigious journal, Child Development . Students have been heavily involved in all aspects of the research, including co-authorship on publications and presentations. Several of these students have earned (n=3) or are pursuing doctorates (n=2) or have earned Ed.S. degrees in school psychology (n=6). Dr. Sam McFarland: My research in psychology now focuses a sense of \"oneness with all humanity\" and human rights (a paper is under review ). My recent studies have also addr essed self-selection for the Stanford Prison Experiment (a paper with former student Thomas Carnahan is scheduled for publication February 2007), authoritarianism and the psychology of religion (encyclopedia review on \"Authoritarianism and Religion\" is in press, scheduled for 2007 publication). Academically, I am transitioning from being a research psychologist to a human rights educator. In the latter realm, I have co-authored a text related to human rights entitled Courageous Resisters: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Courage, scheduled for publication in 2007; we hope that it will be used widely in college courses . I am writing a second book on human rights tentatively titled Heroes of a Different Kind: Builders of Human Rights, which I will complete in 2007. Dr. Kelly Madole: My research focuses on how cognitive developmental changes impact the way that infants, children, and adults organize the world. My main goal is to develop a unified theory for understanding the development of categorization. Thus, I am conducting research in two major areas. First, I am exploring object categorization, focusing on developmental changes in the way infants and young children categorize artifacts and natural objects. Seco nd, I am exploring the early development of social categorization, focusing on when ch ildren attend to and make use of social categories such as gender and race. My research questions attract students interested in cognitive development as well as those interested in social development so I involve many students in research. Many of my studies require intensive behavioral observation of infants and young children. Students working in my lab become experts in behavioral coding, which is invaluable for students who plan to continue in psychological research. Dr. Leroy Metze: My major scholarly activity is e-train, a project designed to increase the number and quality of new teachers who effectively use tech nology to facilitate, asse ss and communicate learning for all students. Since only 20% of current teachers f eel comfortable using technology in their classrooms and over two million new technolo gy proficient teachers are needed in the next decade, we have implemented programs and practices designed to ensure that all t eachers graduating fr om our teacher education program can use technology to increase stude nt achievement and assess student learning; ensure that all university faculty from t eacher education and the arts and scie nces departments can model effective technology-assisted instruction; ensure that electronic portfolios are used as the primary means of gathering data used in the evaluation of t eacher performance; and set up an el ectronic clearinghous e that will give teachers and teacher educators throu ghout the country access to exemplary technology-assisted lesson plans and assessments . Dr. Lakeisha Meyer: My primary research interest is ex amining how the needs of youth with emotional and behavioral difficulties are addresse d in schools and in the co mmunity. I am currently examining racial disparities in placement restrictiv eness and service utiliza tion for such youth who participate in systems of care. Additional research activity will address how schools address the needs of students by examining the application of system of care principles in schools, the implementation of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and the effectiveness of targeted problem solving teams. Much of my research will involve the evaluation of programs and interventions in school settings. This will be done within the context of relationships I have established with community and statewide organizations, such as the Kentucky Center for Instructional Discip line. Also, WKU students will have an opportunity to participate in data collection, analysis, manuscript pr eparation, and presentations , which will foster student engagement and learning. Dr. Richard Miller: My academic and research interests are focused on organizational leadership and effectiveness. I collect data on employee attitudes towa rd the workplace with a fo cus on identifying best practices for worker satisfaction and organizational profitability. 20Dr. Kathi Miner-Rubino: My research program focuses on the link between respectful workplace climates and the occupational health and well-being of employees. I am especially interested in the degree to which workplace contexts are inclus ive and respectful of individuals from low-status social groups (e.g., women, people of color), and how working in such climates affects not only people who are members of these groups, but also employees who do not fall within these social categories. In all of my research, I integrate and contribute to the areas of organizationa l, social, personality, and feminist psychology. My research has potential implications for all employed people and their health and well-being at work, especially those from disadvantaged groups. I am also committed to training the next generation of researchers. Because of this, I also include students in all phases of my resear ch including study design, data collection, data analysis, and manuscript writing. Dr. Sharon Mutter: The objective of my research is to gain a greater understanding of older adults' sensitivity to environmental contingencies, includin g their ability to acquire and retrieve contingency knowledge and their ability to use this knowledge for judgment and prediction. My research program addresses this objective by seeking to (1) integrate theories of cognitive aging and contingency judgment; (2) systematically assess older adults' contingency lear ning and judgment ability; (3) obtain information on ways to optimize the performance of older adults with limitations in contingency learning and judgment. This research has provided important insights not only on older adults' contingency learning, but also on the basic cognitive processes that underlie similar be haviors, such as causal judgment, stereotyping, categorization, hypothesis testing, and prediction. This information will be useful in the design of training programs and external aids that help older adults improve their judgment and prediction and feel more confident about these abilities. Students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels have been actively engaged in my research projects. Dr. Carl Myers: The nature of my research primarily consis ts of a variety of aspects related to the validity of various child assessment measures (IQ, academic achievement, early literacy, behavior rating scales). My research has also examined aspects of interventions (e.g., increas ing phonemic awareness in Head Start students, increasing reading comprehensio n in elementary aged st udents, decreasing self- injurious behavior) as well as topics in the broader field of school psychology (e.g., consultation in the school psychology literature). External communities (e .g., Head Start program, parents, schools) have benefited directly from the intervention research. Students have been actively engaged in almost every research project, leading to numerous national presentations and some publications. Dr. Farley Norman: My laboratory studies the human perception of distance, spatial relationships, and the 3-dimensional shape of environmental objects. We study both visual and haptic (i.e., active touch) 3-D shape perception. Biological perceptual systems have the capability to rapidly perceive depth and 3-D object shape; if this were not the case, animals and people would not be able to find and locate food, interact with objects, make tools, or navigate effectivel y. As part of our research, we also study changes in perception that accompany aging. We have already dete rmined that older observers are able to effectively perceive many aspects of 3-D object shape well into their 70's and 80's. Identifying age-related perceptual deficits helps us to predict which behavioral ac tivities are safe for older observers, and which are dangerous. Thus, the further study of aging and perception may help all of us to live a safer life as we become older. Dr. Tony Paquin: My main research interests are in the ar eas of cross-cultural differences in group dynamics (e.g., incivility) and attempts to improve productivity and leadership in traditional and nontraditional organizations. I also am engaged in several projects surrounding psychometric issues in the design of instruments and interventions used to improve organizational effectiveness. Past research has demonstrated that interventions successful in one cu lture are not effective in others. The increasing globalization of the business community makes it critical that organizations understand the impact culture has on intervention success. My research adds to this understanding. Graduate and undergraduate students are involved with many aspects of my research including data collec tion, entry, and analysis. I am currently writing a grant that would include students in the overseas portions of my research projects. Dr. Phil Pegg : My research program presently includes: ethnic identity; behavioral medicine; and, student engagement. I am currently conducting initial psychometric research toward the development of a 21measure of medical anxiety; this measure will be th e most comprehensive measure of health-care related anxieties to date and will be of benefit in tailoring behavioral interventions for anxious patients. The development of the measure will provide the basis for at least one masters-level thesis. In tandem with a WKU graduate student, I am also conducting a we b-based study examining media usage, stress, and negative affectivity in the significant others of member s of the Armed Forces recently deployed in Iraq. Significant others of deployed military personnel are an under-researched population and the research will clarify how media consumption and information-seeking behaviors impact their functioning and mental health. Research in the area of ethnic identity clarif ies the importance of ethnicity in at-risk minority youth. Dr. William Pfohl : My research has been involved with graduate students who do Education Specialist Projects. Thus, students have been involved with all of them. They have focused in general on emotional Intelligence (EQ). Eight theses have focused on child and adolescent aspects of EQ. These Ed.S projects have initiated research that is unique in the literature, as there are few studies on children and EQ. The Multi-Health System Company has provided strong support for these efforts. I have also conducted one Ed.S. project on teacher EQ, an d was on one committee, surveying college students and EQ. Now that I am back, I plan on pursuing this line of research again. My other scholarly activity has focused on technology in school psychology and one data gathering project on \"Legends in the Field of School Psychology\". These latter two projects will result in article (Legends) and chapter in a book (technology). Two Graduate students were involved in the Legends project. I have conducted workshops involving current research on school violence and Post Trauma tic Stress Disorder in the USA and Internationally. Dr. Katrina Phelps: My scholarly interests involve the applica tion research knowledge in the areas of child and adolescent development to the design and implementation of programs that promote positive youth development. Dr. Jackie Pope-Tarrence : I am currently involved in two ar eas of research. The first involves psychology and law, with emphasis on community po licing, and attitudes toward jury service. The community policing project is an attempt to look at various ways for our local police to engage the community in its efforts to serve the community. This project includes involvement with the community, as well as the engagement of students. I have had students (graduate and undergraduate) assist me with the project for the last 2 years. The ju ry service project is a part of th e American Democracy project through the American Association of State Colleges and Univers ities, of which WKU is a participating partner. I have also had students (graduate and undergraduate) assist with this project during the last year. The second research project involves a collaborative effort to as sess the effectiveness of model eliciting activities w/in a rural classroom. The nature of the project involv es collaborative research with several WKU faculty members, as well as with teachers in the rural classroom setting. Dr. Carrie Pritchard: I have two major research interests. The first focuses on epistemological reasoning among children and adults. This research co mpares everyday reasoning about conclusions that follow from evidence with academic reasoning of the same sort. The outcomes of this research may help educators better understand children's everyday understandings and ways of thinking about evidence, in order to improve teaching of these c oncepts. Since I teach future educators, my research is often a starting point for discussion in the classroom. Dr. Anne Rinn: My research examines the intellectual, so cial, and emotional development of gifted adolescents and gifted college students and how programs available for gifted students (e.g., summer programs and honors programs) influence their developmen t. In this research, I integrate perspectives from educational psychology and social psychology to examine how various environments affect students' development. While conducting this research, I also strive to provide learning opportunities for students and to provide practical app lication of my research findings. I believe students learn best when they are actively engaged in a learning experi ence. Thus, I encourage students to work in my research laboratory and to do everything from entering data to writing a final manuscript for publication. Regarding the practical nature of my research, my findings often pr ovide implications for programmatic design. I try to present those implications at conferences, as well as highlight the practical importance of the research within each manuscript I write. 22Dr. Dan Roenker: Many older adults suffer age related dec lines in sensory, cognitive, and physical functions. It is widely acce pted that these declines contribute to di fficulties in the perf ormance of everyday activities especially driving. Driving is a critical asp ect of mobility for many older adults and the loss of driving privileges often portends the onset of depressi on, decreased health, cognitive decline, increased risk for disability, and decreased longevity. The ability to identify older drivers at risk for crash involvement has clear societal and health care benefits, especially if techniques can be developed that delay the onset of the impairment of the critical skills n ecessary for driving. The focus of my research program is to develop methods for the early identification and remediation of these critical cognitive skills and thereby extend mobility. The primary screening tool that we have developed, the Useful Field of View or UFOV is widely used by researchers, occupational therapists and gov ernment organizations in North America, Europe, and Australia. Dr. Betsy Shoenfelt: Applied problems encountered in service experiences frequently provide impetus for research studies, contributing to a range of applied topics addressed by my research and providing a sound empirical basis for my applied work. The research provides empiri cal answers to practical questions for organizational constituents internal and external to the university. Published results benefit a broader community. Examples of recent applied research include program evaluations for the Warren County Family Court Truancy Court Diversion Program, the Bowling Green Housing Authority After School Program, the Warren County School Board Alternative to Suspension Program, the ALIVE Center, and a mental skills for serving training prog ram for intercollegiate volleyball. Recent research includes: reviews of EEO Court of Appeal (or higher) cases dealing w ith cognitive ability testing and physical ability testing to determine what drives decisions for plaintiff or de fendant to inform organizations of potential liability factors; a realistic job preview for Deputy Jailer app licants; an analysis of pr egnancy leave practices; an evaluation of NHL fan reactions; sexual harassment factors impacting perceptions of sexual harassment in jury decision-making contexts; the dynamics of Organizational Justice (i.e., fairness) perceptions in team disciplinary decisions; and role clarification in interdependent team sports. Dr. Joyce Wilder: My research interests are in college student development, cultural diversity, adolescent psychology, American sign language interpretation and deaf culture, and women's issues. Dr. Steve Wininger: My research is divided between two subfields of psychology: 1) Sport and Exercise Psychology, and 2) Educational Psychology. My main interest in Sport and Exercise Psychology has always been exercise adherence . I have examined the following independent variables on exercise adherence: group cohesion, class leader characteristics, music, se lf-efficacy, autonomy, perceived competence, exercise intensity, expectations, temp erature, goal orientations, achievement motivation, attributions, and attentional focus. Implications: im proved health. In terms of educational psychology, currently, I am focusing on performa nce feedback for teachers and coache s. How and how often do they get feedback? Is the feedback reliable and valid to a de gree for which they can ex tract meaning from it and subsequently improve their teaching/coaching? These ar e questions I will address within the next year. I hope to use the results of this research to create an intervention program. I plan on pursuing external funding for this project. Implica tions: improved teaching/coaching. 2.

Description of Faculty Ov erall Service Activity As the narratives below illustrate, faculty in the Department of Psychology are very engaged in University service, public service and regional stewardship, and service to the profession of psychology. Department faculty are heavily represented on University standing committees, have been actively involved in University Senate, and have participated on nume rous ah hoc committees and task forces, in many instances holding leadership positions. In the realm of public service, Department of Psychology faculty have served on the governing boards of a wide range of state and local organizations and agencies. In addition, Department faculty regularly provide consulting services, workshops and other presentations to agencies, organizations, and businesses in Western's service region and beyond. These are important and meaningful regional stewardship activities that help Western fulfill its obligation to provide faculty expertise to improve the regional community. Finally, Department faculty have provided service to the profession through their leadership roles in professional organizations, editing journals and newsletters, service on editorial boards of professional journals, service on conference submission review committees, and service on federal agency grant review pane ls and as ad hoc grant proposal reviewers. 2. Faculty Service Narratives (Current faculty only) Dr. Marty Bink: University Service . In my two years at Western, I have served on two standing departmental committees (both of which I Chair) and one ad hoc University committee. I also served the profession by participating as an ad hoc reviewer for four jo urnals, three textbooks, and one book. At the University level, I was a member of the University Senate Committee on the Division I Football. Service on that committee required about 15 hours of my time and I spent six months on the committee. At the Department level, I chair the Study Board Committee. The Study Board is directs student engagement activities for all PSY 100 students (approximate ly 2000 students each academic year). Part of my responsibilities involve maintaining an online system that informs, directs, and reports student activity in re search participation. I devote about five hours a week to duties associated with the Study Boar d. I began service on the Study Board Committee when I was hired in Fall 2004. The other departmental committee on which I serve and chair is the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee. I be gan service on committee in the winter of 2005 and assumed the Chair in Spring 2006. I spend about one hour a week in service to the committee during the academic year. The committee considers proposals for changes in the undergraduate curriculum and participates in the evaluation of the program. Public and Professional Service . In my time at Western, I have reviewed seven manuscripts for Memory and Cognition, Applied Psychology, Memory, and Psychological Science. I also participated in the review of two Introduction to Psychology texts and one Co gnition text. In addition, I reviewed one book on prospective memory for Lawren ce Erlbaum and associates. Dr. Reagan Brown: University Service . I have served on the University Academ ic Probation Committee and the University Advisory Committee on Faculty Continuance for the last two years. Additionally, I have served on many, many departmental and college faculty search committees. Finally, I have served on 75 thesis committees since 1998. For 20 of these committees I served as the chair of the committee. Public Service . I have consulted with business and industry on ten projects since 1998. All projects involved addressing a need or problem area in the realm of personnel selection or employee termination. I 40have taught a free GRE preparatory class to Western Kentucky University undergraduate students for the last eight years. Professional Service . I have served as a reviewer for two journals and one national conference for the last seven years. Dr. John Bruni: University Service . I have served on a number of department, college, and university committees during this period. . However, these committees can generally be grouped into one of following two categories: (1) faculty governance; and (2) research, evaluation and accountability. In terms of faculty governance I include my work on a number of department, college, and university committees. However, I do believe my most significant activities in the area of governan ce are as member and/or representative of the University Senate to the campus community. The University Senate provides one of the two counterbalances to un iversity administration pressure. As a member and/or representative I have had the opportunity to rise and address issues that affect faculty, staff and studen ts that I would not have had if I were not part of this body. It is in the area of research support that I believe I have made my most significant contribution to the university. Whether in service on university committees or as the first director of the Office of Applied Research and Analysis , it is in this area that I believe that I have made, and will continue to make, a unique contribution to the university and to the research I have consulted on. My consulting has been both in and out of the Psychology Department with primary attention being focused on statistical analysis of survey types of data. As WKU increasingly stresses the importance of research, the need for support in the areas of statis tics, research design, and measurement will increase. Public service . I have had the chance to serve as a statisti cal consultant to a numb er of public (Bowling Green Department of Human Resources, Human Rights Commission, Bowling Green Schools, Warren County Schools, Todd County Schools, Bowling Green Police Department) and private organizations (Kaplan Press, Big Brothers and Sisters of Bow ling Green, Kentucky Ameri can Cancer Society). The significance of these interactions has been working with local schools in the area of minority student issues. In addition to providing statistical and measurement su pport to these organizations my experiences provide real world examples for the classroom. My experiences with public organizations have convinced me of the need for independent management and treatment of data. Therefore, for the last year I have been working on designing a website focusing on K-16 data reporting and analysis. Professional service . Activities have included working with peers and students on conference presentations. I frequently attend meetings that address issues relate d to my work as an on site statistical consultant. I have also reviewed submissions for the American Psychological Association annual meeting, submissions to the Journal of Military Psychology, and submissions for number of regional educational related organizations. However, I believe that my major contribution has been in my reviews for peers, both in and out of the Psychology Department, of articles they are planning to submit for publication. Dr. Pitt Derryberry: University Service . In terms of university servi ce, I have been involved in se veral endeavors. In each of my years at Western I since becoming a faculty member in the 2001-2002 academic year, I have served on a number of search committees for various experiment al, clinical, and educational faculty positions for the Psychology department. Serving on these committees has been rewarding to me personally since I helped to play a role in the identification and selection of some highly productive faculty members. I have also been a member of the Curriculum Committee for the College of Education and Behavioral Science since the 2003-2004 academic y ear. In this capacity, I have been involv ed in making decisions regarding course offerings, program changes, and other curricular policies and procedures. As a member of this committee, I have served on its alternate admissions subcommittee. This involvement has been gratifying as I have been able to play a role in the selection of worthy students with promising futures who - for various extenuating circumstances - were not able to meet the standardized entry re quirements for graduate admission. I have also served as an Et rain technology advocate. In this role, I have been able to both learn about and help share knowledge about the technological resources that are available to WKU faculty and educators in surrounding K-12 systems. I feel that what I have gained and shared as an Etrain technology advocate has been instrumental in helping to promote the sharing of ideas among colleagues in our shared pursuit of additional means and resources for engaging students in and beyond the classroom. 41Public Service . My opportunities for public service have been limited. However, one endeavor is important to note. I was responsible for conducting data analysis and helping to disseminate the results for Christ Episcopal Church's Christian Education Survey . Although I acknowledge that I am a member of this church, I am not a member of their Christian Edu cation Committee. The Christian Education Committee sought my assistance as a result of my employment as an educational psychologist at WKU. As such, I feel this is a viable example of how I have been able to provide professional e xpertise within the Bowling Green community. Professional Service . I have reviewed presentation proposals for the annual conferences of the Association for Moral Education, American Psychological Asso ciation, and the American Educational Research Association. I have served as a reviewer of manuscripts for the Journal of College and Character , Journal of Moral Education , and Urban Education . I am currently a member of the Editorial Board for the Journal of College and Character . I have provided book reviews upon invitation for the Journal of Moral Education . I am very committed to these endeavors not onl y because allow me to pr ovide a service to my profession but also because they of fer me the chance to play a role in ensuring the dissemination of quality research that is pertinent to my fields of interest. Dr. Rick Grieve: University Service . I have been Chair of the Human Subjects Review Board since 2004. My responsibilities include reviewing all research involving human participants to ensure that basic human rights protections are offered, and that the guidelines of the Office of Human Rights Protections are being followed. In addition to my responsibilities as Chair, I was also asked to serve on the Search Committee to hire a Compliance Manager for the University. In 2003- 2004, I served as an alte rnate for Faculty Senate. Within the Department of Psychology, I am the Coordinator of the Clinical Psychology Master's Program. My responsibilities include reviewing applicants for th e department, and guiding the successful applicants through the master's program. I serve as advisor for all clinical MA students. I also chair the weekly Clinical/School area meetings, and act as liason between the group and the Department Chair. I serve as the Director of the Psychology Training Clinic. My responsibilities include supervising assessments of WKU students and Bowling Green community members that are completed by clinical graduate students as part of their internship experience. I am a member of the Study Board Committee and the Undergraduate Program Committee. I have served as Chair of thre e search committees: two clinical positions and one social position. Public Service . Since 2003, I have been active in completing assessments for the Department of Disability Determinations for the state. I generally complete between two and three a month (I have one scheduled every week, but have a number of no-shows). I also regularly complete other evaluations, including parenting evaluations and psychological evaluations for accommodations for immigrants who have difficulties passing the citizenship examination. From 2002 until May 2006, I was a member of the CenterStone Research Review Committee, which is thei r Institutional Review Board. I continue to be an alternate member, and attend meetings whenever there is the possibility of not making a quorum. I am coach of my son's inline hockey team for the Warren County Inline Hockey League. I believe my training as a sport psychologist gives me a unique perspective on sport participation that I try to share with the players, parents of the players, and league. Professional Service . I am the Symposium Coordinator for the Sport Fans Special Interest Group for the Association of Applied Sport Psychology. I ensure th at the SIG has a symposium at the annual convention of AASP every year. I have held this position since 20 04, when it was created. I am also a member of the Social Psychology Committee for AASP and work to review conference applications and suggest speakers for the next convention. I am Associate Editor for the Journal of Sport Behavior and regularly review manuscripts for the journal. I regularly review manuscripts for the Psi Chi Journal of Undergraduate Research . Other journals that I have been an ad hoc reviewer for include the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition , the Journal of Clinical and Consulting Psychology , Psychological Bulletin , and Sex Roles . Dr. Melissa Hakman: University Service . In 2004, I served on 2 search committees for two faculty positions (industrial/organizational and clinical). I also serv ed as the coordinator for the Department's United Way Campaign, and I also served on the Departmental Facu lty Award Committee. I al so served from 2004 to present on the College of Education and Behavioral Science Undergraduate Curriculum Committee. In 422005, I served as a committee member on the Undergraduate Awards Committee and the Endowed Professor Committee. I also began serving and am currently serving as the CE BS representative to the University Curriculum Committee. I also served as a mentor for the Gateway Program. I also am a member of Graduate Faculty and advise undergraduate students. I also represented the department at the WKU Job Fair in Spring 2006. I provided 1 year of post doctoral supervision for fellow colleague through Counseling and Testing Center. I also have supervised 4 mater's students during their 1 year internship providing therapy and assessment services at Rivendell Behavioral Health Services. Public Service . Since September 2004, I made 10 different presentations in the community ranging from the Grandparents as Caregivers Conference, KSSC st ate volunteer conference, Mental Health and Aging Conference, and at local support groups. Since 2003, I have served as a member of Rivendell Behavioral Health Services Governing Board and on the Grandparent Advisory Board for Barren River Area Development District. In 2006, I began serving as a member on the Barren County Community Early Childhood Council. I also served as a moderator for a teen suicide panel at the 2 nd annual Teen Summit in 2005. I also served as an unpaid consultant for the Counseling and Testing Center. I also created 2 group treatments for grandchildren being raised by their grandparents to address adjustment, psychological, and emotional difficulties. I conducted 2 rounds of groups for 8 weeks each pro bono in collaboration with BRADD. Professional Service . I obtained licensure in the state of Kentuc ky as a licensed clinical psychologist in 2004. Since that time, I have maintained my license. Once licensed, I provided assessment and therapy services through the Regional Child Development Clinic, which is a nonprofit organization associated with United Way. Services were provided at a reduced rate. I opened a private practice office in September 2005 where I provide assessment and th erapy services to the co mmunity with some of the services being at a significantly reduced rate or probono. I also maintain my membership to the Kentucky Psychological Association, Kentucky Academy of Science, American Psychological Association, and the Association for Behavioral Cognitive Therapies. Dr. Elizabeth L. Jones: My public service has focused on early intervention community in the Western region of Kentucky. Specifically I have been on the Barren River Area Development District Early Intervention Committee (BRAD DEIC), a regional committee that reports to the state Interagency Coordinating Council, a federally mandated committee that provides monitoring and policy decisions for the children with developmental delays and disabilities (Part C of IDEA). I have se rved on that committee for 12 years and provided leadership for the committee for 6 of those years. Another service outlet has been to provide board leadership for Regional Child Development Clinics, a United Way sponsored program providing evaluation services for young children with suspected developmental delays and disabilities. I have provided leadership for that board for the past year. Service to the profession activities include providing workshops and presentations at the state, national and international level on topics ranging from self-injury to a variety of early childhood topics (e.g., interventions, child centered curriculum, observing and recording behavior). University service has focused on committees relevant to graduate programs including Graduate Council, Graduate Student Research Award Committee of Gr aduate Council, CEBS Professional Education Committee and Psychology Department School and Clinical Committee. Dr. Elizabeth Lemerise: UniversityService: From 1998 - 2006, Dr. Lemerise has served on a variety of departmental, college, and university committees. Among these committees, she wa s a member (1992-2000) and chair (2000-2003) of the University Committee for the Protection of Human Research Participants. During her tenure, due to educational activities promoting awareness of these ethical requirements, the committee experienced a large increase in applications reviewed from both students and faculty, and the committee completed the training and paperwork to be registered with the federal government. She also has been a member (1998- 2003) and Vice-Chair (2003-present) of the Univer sity Committee on Credits and Graduation , a member of the Faculty Scholarship Council, as well as a memb er of the University Honors Committee (1995-2006), chairing the 1998 search for an H onors Director.

In addition I have served on several search committees within the de partment, including the Department Head Search committee. I also served as the Psi Chi advisor from 2000-2003. I have mentored new faculty in the department and I mentor many students each year, both in my capacity as an advisor and in supervising the many independent study, NSF REU, and graduate students who have done research with me. I served the College of Education and Behavioral Sciences on the college Faculty/Staff Advisory Committee. This year I also collaborated in leading a workshop at the CE BS Professional Development Day entitled, \"Discussing Racial Issues in the Classroom\". In that capacity and in other service activities, I have tried to use my research knowledge about racial cat egorization to inform my service to the university and the public. I have served on the University Diversity committee, I moderated a forum for the Student Affairs Hot Topic series on biracial identity and biracial relationships, I taught a workshop at the Kentucky Senior Service Corps Conference on Racial Diversity and I regula rly attend recruitment fairs for minority students. Public Service . In other aspects of public service, I have served several times as a judge at WKU's Sigma Xi Student Research Conference, I taught a class on Experimental Child Psychology at the Girls in Science Day, and I have presented workshops for parents at local preschools and churches. I recently began serving on the curriculum committee for the Capitol Arts Youth Theatre, where I have been helping to establish developmentally-grounded goals for children's theatre classes. Professional Service . I serve as a reviewer for several different journals, including Child Development , the Journal of Cognition and Development and Experimental Child Psychology. Dr. Kathi Miner-Rubino: University Service : Since starting my position as a Psychology faculty member in August, 2004, I have served on five departmental committees. The purpose of the first committee, the Psychology Department Awards Task Force Committee was to identify exceptiona l faculty for departmental awards. Selection of these individuals helped recognize the accomplishmen ts and contributions of outstanding Psychology faculty both for the university and the discipline as a whole. The second committee was the Psychology 100 Textbook Adoption Committee, whose purpose was to review approximately 15 Introduction to Psychology texts. This committee bene fited the university and students who attend WKU by ensuring that students are assigned outstanding learning materials. In line with the university's goals for student learning, I also completed all of the requirements for Master Advisor Training wh ich ensures that students receive quality advising. I also served on the Psychology Depa rtment Scholarship Committee whose purpose was to select recipients of departmental student awards. This committee not only recognized outstanding students for the university community, but be nefited students by allowing recipients to report their excellent performance on job and graduate school applications. The fourth committee I served on was the Psychology Department Educational Psychology Search Committee. This committee reviewed and 44interviewed candidates for a faculty position in Psychology. This committee benefited both the university and its students by ensuring that students, faculty, and staff work with well-trained individuals who can contribute to the mission of WKU. Finally, I also served (and am currently serving) on the Psychology Department Undergraduate Program Committee, which discusses curriculum issues. This committee also benefits the university and its students by ensuring that students get a quality education. Public Service: I have also been involved in public service since I began my appointment at WKU. For example, I was interviewed twice by the media during the evaluation period. The first interview was conducted by the College Heights Herald on college drinking and fake IDs. The second interview was broadcast on WKYU PBS on April 4, 2006 and was on pay inequity based on gender. My service in this area benefited the university, students, and larger Bowling Green community by providing expert commentary on important social issues. I also cond ucted data analyses and summarized findings in a technical report for Freeman Webb Corporation which helped establish links between WKU and the larger community. Professional Service: I have also been heavily involved in professional service. Since 2004 (when I became a faculty member), I have served as a journal reviewer for seven different journals in Psychology and Organizational Studies. My service in this ar ea links WKU with the discipline of Psychology on a broad level. Dr. Sharon Mutter: University Service . During this review period, many of my service activities focused on contributing to the educational mission of the university. I served two terms plus an extra year as the Psychology Department representative to the University Senate and during all bu t one year of this 5-year period, I was a member of the General Education Committee. After my tenure as senator was over, I was r eappointed to the General Education Committee by the University Senate Executive Committee and I continue to serve on this committee at the present time. I also served on the SACS Assessment Committee for General Education and was the Senate representative on the Provost' s Committee on Student SITE Questions. My other service activities related to the educational mission of the university included serving on the Gerontology Curriculum Committee and as the Gerontology Minor Coordinator. I have also served for many years on the Cultural Enhancement Committee and the Psychology Department Undergraduate Curriculum Committee and beginning in Spring 2005, I became the Experimental Psychology M.A. Program Coordinator. I devoted substantial time during this review period to service activities designed to improve undergraduate and graduate student research opportunitie s. I obtained a 3-year grant from NSF to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) pr ogram in the Psychology Department. This program provided high-achieving students from WKU and other universities across the country with eight weeks of financial support so they could conduct research with faculty members in the department. I directed six M.A. or Ed.S. theses and one honors thesis, served on two graduate thesis committees, and mentored eight undergraduate and graduate students in independent study, as well as seven undergraduate students in the REU program. I have also been involved in a variety of service activities less directly related to the university's educational mission. As a senator, I serv ed on the University Senate Executive Committee, the University Senate Faculty Welf are and Professional Responsib ilities Committee, and the Ad Hoc Committee on Division 1A Football. I have been a member of the University Disciplinary Committee and the Psychology Study Board Committee for several years. I also served on the CEBS Dean's Faculty/Staff Advisory Council and on numerous college and department al search committees. Finally, I served on the University Committee that selected the University-wide Faculty Award Winners for Teaching, Research, Service, and Advising, I was a panel member for CEBS faculty development workshops on Grant Proposal Development and Tenure and Promotion, and I am a me mber of the steering comm ittee for the Center for Lifespan Development. Public Service . Many of my public service activities during this review period were directed toward using my expertise in cognitive aging to educate the community on aging issues. I was a member of the Executive Board of the Kentucky Association for Gerontology and served as Secretary and Treasurer and Chair of the Finance Committee for this organization. I was a member of the Advisory Board for Health Enhancement of Rural Elderly (HERE) project that was conducted by WKU Departments of Nursing, Public Health, and Social Work. I de livered lectures to local, state, and national organizations addressing aging issues. These included invited presentations on Maintaining Cognitive Ability in Old Age to local church groups and to attendees at the Kentucky Associ ation for Gerontology conference.

Professional Service . From 1998 until 2003, I served as Consulting Editor of the Psychonomic Society Journal Perception & Psychophysics . In that role, I helped to maintain the high standards for one of the best journals in my professional field of expertise. I have also served as chairs of paper sessions at the annual meetings of the Psychonomic Society. Dr. Hideko Norman: University Service : I serve as an academic advisor to about 10 to 20 undergraduate students. Especially because of the nature of my appoin tment as an instructor, advising is one of my most significant service activities. Therefore I participated in many advising related workshops to develop my advising skills. I am always available to students who need help and guidance. 46Public Service and Professional Service : I regularly serve as a judge at a Regional Science Fair as a psychology/behavioral science specialist. I talk w ith junior/senior high school students during their presentations, and provide them with suggestions and relevant information that students are not aware of. I also provide encouragement and/ or advice about their studies. Dr. Tony Paquin: University Service : As Chair of the Center fo r Leadership Excellence (CLE) Student Assessment Center subcommittee, I coordinated the development of an assessment center to be used for program evaluation and assessment of student progress in the University Leadership Certificate Prog ram. One product of the assessment center will be detailed feedback reports to be provided to the students. Over the past two years I have also served on a number of other committees including the CLE Steering Committee, Human Subjects Review Board (Alternate), the CEBS Assessm ent Advisory Committee, the CEBS Undergraduate Program Committee, and eight thesis committees (two as chair).

Public/Professional Service : Prior to working at Western Kentucky University I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Kingdom of Tonga (2002-2004). I have used this experience to help promote the Peace Corps by staffing tables for the Un ited States Peace Corps at internationa l fairs, and met in person or via phone with individuals (students and parents) in Bowling Green, KY and Chicago, IL who are about to enter the Peace Corps to better prepare them for their upcoming service. I have al so supervised 13 field projects involving the development of training curriculum or job analyses for several local organizations including Lyons Company, Stewart and Richey Construction, Warren County Kentucky Regional Jail, Camping World/Affinity Group, Lexington Green Movies 8 Theater, Sensus Precision Die Casting, and the Helms/Craven Libraries Safety Patrol Staff. Dr. Phil Pegg: University Service : I began my tenure at WKU in the Fall of 2004.

I have been engaged with the university as a member of the Gerontology committee, comprised of faculty who instruct classes in the gerontology minor; my invol vement with that committee began in th e Spring of 2005. Additionally, since the summer of 2005, I begin to function as an advisor to undergraduate psychology students and have regularly participated in orientation and registration ac tivities. To date, I have approximately 15 designated undergraduate advisees, and my advising load is comparable to the other tenured or tenure-track faculty members in the psychology department. Each semester I make an attempt to contact my advisees and to set up a brief meeting with them to establish goals and important \"milestones\" in their way toward graduation. As concerns my service to the greater University co mmunity, as of July, 2005 I became president of the WKU chapter of the Phi Kappa Phi Honors Society for a two-year term; I had been unofficially functioning in that capacity since May, 2005. During my tenure as president the organization has continued to vigorously enlist qualified student members as well as participate in activities within the national Phi Kappa Phi organization (including identifying student applicants for available scholarship monies). I have also had the opportunity to work with the Univers ity Honors Program to facilitate the enlistment of WKU students for Phi Kappa Phi scholarships. Germane both to university service and service within my profession (as a clinical psychologist), from January through May of 2005, I provided therapy and evaluation services through the Counseling and Testing Center at South Campus 2 days a week; additionally, I attended weekly clinical meetings with my supervisor to further conceptualize my casework with this WKU student population. Public Service : With regard specifically to public service, I have had the pleasure to represent the University and the department of psychology as an interviewee on the program, Midday Live , the local 47ABC affiliate, on three separate occasions; these inte rviews provided informati on about such clinically relevant issues as post-partum depression and ment al illness in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Professional Service : My professional service takes two primary forms. First, I have worked extensively in the capacity of an editorial adviser on both two introductory level psychology textbooks and several computer-based lab activities for undergraduate students; I continue to be invited to function in an editorial capacity for both introductory- and adva nced-level psychology textbooks. Fu rthermore, at the present, I am a member of the McGraw-Hill PsychInteractive Advisory Board. As a member of the editorial advisory board, my input and editorial advice will be used to assist in media development over the next few years. The primary focus of the project is the improvement of PsychInteractiv e, a computer-based interactive learning tool for students in undergraduate psychology classes. My second area of professional service is in my work professional work as a clinical psychologist. I am an active member of the American Psychological Association and am currently licensed to practice clin ical psychology in the state of Kentucky. I also attempt to stay in contact with students for whom I previously have provided research guidance and mentoring to offer assistance or counsel in their own professional development. As of October 1, 2005, I established a professional practice as a \"Licensed Psychologist\" at in Bowling Green, Kentucky. In my capacity as a practicing clinician, I have provided services to local clients on a sliding scale (at considerably lower than my billing rate). I ge nerally devote approximately 7 to eight hours a week to the provision of therapy and assessment services.

I was President 2005-06 and President-elect 2004-05. This is my second time as NASP President (1996-97 ). As President this time, I did 20 state organization keynotes, 16 meetings at the na tional and international level; and testified before the Child Mental Health Sub-committee in the US Senate. I testified concerning the new federal Regulations at 48the hearing for Federal Law IDEA - 2004 in Nashville TN. I served as NASP's Web Master from 2000- 2005.

Summary: During the review period, my most significant University service activities have been my involvement with curriculum committees at departmental, college, and university levels, including undergraduate and graduate, and including Wo men's Studies; my role in co-chairing the SACS re-affirmation project, 2001-2005; activities connected with program review, and work with assessment. My leadership roles have included, again, SACS co-chair; chair of Academic Council; chair of the college's curriculum and graduate programs committees; vice chair of PEC and UCC; and other shorter- term appointments. In my present role as Associate Dean, I attend numerous university events, such as admissions open houses, scholarship r eceptions, faculty receptions, etc. In all of these activities I believe I bring the perspective that my training in psychology has developed, including critical thinking skills, interpersonal skills, and knowledge of applied aspects of human behavior. Public Service . Since 2002 I have been the WKU representa tive on the Board of Directors for Lifeskills, Inc. I am also a member of the five-member Board of Ethics for the City of Bowling Green. In both of these roles I use my knowledge and skills as a psychologist and my training as a behavioral scientist to contribute to the welfare of people in our community. Also, during the review period on more than a dozen occasions I was a guest speaker on psychology-relate d topics on WBKO's \"Midday\" program, and I have occasionally been invited to speak at public schools or community organizations. I consider these speaking engagements to be a way of \"giving psychology away,\" and in that sense they are extensions of my role as a professor of psychology. Furthermore, they are wa ys to make use of my qualifications as a licensed psychologist, even though I do not pr esently engage in private practice. Professional Service . Summary: My professional service during the review period has been entirely connected with the Society for the Teaching of Psychology (STP), which is also Division 2 of the American Psychological Association. The two most significant roles have been serving as a consulting editor for Teaching of Psychology and serving as a member of a national task force, appointed by APA's Board of Educational Affairs, on assessing competencies of undergraduate psychology majors. In the latter role, I co-authored a report presently posted on APA' s site for comment by the membership and the public at large. My professional interests in the teaching and learning of psychology have led me in my Associate Dean role to volunteer to organize and present professional development programming for new and veteran faculty. Also, my work related to program assessment on campus was part of how it happened that I was appointed to the task force on assessing competencies of the undergraduate major in Psychology. Dr. Jackie Pope-Tarrence: I have served on as many as 4-6 standing committees and task force related to my elected position on the city school board and appointed position on the Kentucky School Boards Association.

I am often contacted by organizations requesting assistance with human resource management needs. The type of organization requesting assistance varies from private business and industry to public, not-for-profit organizations. Frequen tly, the type of service requested is of a technical nature and requires substantial time and effort to complete. Much of my public service relates to human resource management.

Much of the remainder of my public service relates to sport psychology. Requests for sport sychology services usually are from intercollegiate athletic teams, groups requesting a workshop, or an individual athlete asking for assistance. In addition to the sport psychology work I have done for WKU Athletes, I have worked with athletes at the University of Nebraska, East Caro lina University, Bowling Gr een High School, Glasgow High School, and The Executive Women's Golf Associa tion, as well as with several professional athletes.

Table 14: Number of Majors Fall 2001 Fall 2002 Fall 2003 Fall 2004 Fall 2005 Majors 434 441 460 446 467 Double majors are counted in each major a student declares. The 2006 Fact Book identifies psychology as the second most popular major at Western in 2001 and the fifth most popular major in 2005. The Fact Book and the data in Table 15, however, underestimate the real growth in the Psychology Major because in fall 2003 the Department began offering a second, 51-credit-hour Extended Major (Reference Code #591). That major had 55 students enrolled in fall 2005 who would presumably otherwise have been enrolled in the General Major. The 33 student (8%) increase in the number of undergraduate psychology majors shown in Table 14 would actually be an increase of 88 students, or 20%, if the 55 students in the Extended Major had been included in the enrollment totals. In that case, the growth would have been 20%, exceeding the overall 14 % enrollment growth for the University. 2. Table 15: Persistence of First-Time Majors (Major Reference # 760) First-time Majors Enrolled Enrolled in Major Enrolled Outside Major Graduated in Major Graduated Outside Major Not Enrolled Fall (N) Status After: (%) (%) (%) (%) (%) 1 Year A first-time major is defined as student who was a major during the fall term above, but was not enrolled in that major during the previous three years. Double majors are counted in each major a student declares. 56 Not surprisingly, persistence of first-time majors decreases with each successive year following initial declaration of the major, but the percentage of students graduating in the major increases with persistence. There are no obvious trends in the data presented in Table 15, and the pattern of changes is fairly consistent across years. B.

The number of graduates increased from 2001 to 2005 by 9%. That increase roughly parallels the 8% increase in the number of majo rs reported in Table 14. C.

Counts include only first majors. Psychology as a first major has steadily increased at Western since 2001, growing by 23% from 2001 to 2005. Among the regional comprehe nsive universities, only Kentucky State University and Murray State University had higher percentage increases (46% and 25%, respectively). The 23% growth rate at Western was considerably higher than that at the next two largest regional comprehensive universities, Eastern Kentucky University (whose program enrollment actually decreased 16% during this period) and Northern Kentucky University (4%). It also exceeded the rate of growth at the Univers ity of Louisville (4%) and approached that at the University of Kentucky (31%). Psychology majors at Western make up 3.1% of the total undergraduate enrollment, behind only Kentucky State (4.5%) and Murray State (3.2%) among the regional comprehensive universities (based on CPE headcount enrollment data).

The 5-year mean ACT score of psychology majors was also higher than the 5-year CEBS and University means. The mean high school GPA for psychology majors was also essentially unchanged from 2001 to 2005 and in each year was slightly below the corresponding CEBS mean but generally about .06-.10 higher than the corresponding University mean. The 5-year average high school GPA of psychology majors was essentially the same as the 5-year av erage of CEBS students overall, and was slightly higher than the 5-year average of all Western students. E. Table 20: Undergraduate GPAs of Program Graduates Undergrad GPA 2000/01 Ave. 3.05 3.07 3.09 3.08 3.11 3.08 The mean GPA of psychology program graduates decreased slightly from 2000/01 to 2004/05 while the CEBS and University means increased. The mean psychology graduate GPA was consistently and considerably less than the CEBS mean. Indeed, the data in Table 20 underestimate that difference because psychology graduates represent a very substantial proportion of the population from which the CEBS mean was calculated. Although the mean GPA of psychology program graduates was greater than the University mean in 2000/01, the University mean increased ac ross years and the psychology mean decreased to the point that by 2005/06 the mean GPA of psychology program graduates was less than the University mean. The view of program faculty is that these trends and differences reflect the relatively more rigorous grading practices in the Department of Psychology. II. Program Description and Self Study A. Mission Statement/Relation of Program to University Mission Part of the mission of Western Kentucky University is to prepare students to be productive, engaged leaders in a global society. The undergraduate psychology program contributes to the fulfillment of that mission by providing students with a strong education in the theoretical, scientific, and applied study of psychology. To that end, the program provides learning and student engagement opportunities that prepare graduates for employment and/or graduate or professional school and opportunities consistent with Western's Quality Enhancement Plan for student engagement in the discipline and for civic engagement. 58B. Teaching and Learning 1. Undergraduate Students As indicated by the data in Table 19 above, psychology majors have ACT scores and high school GPAs that are generally higher than the CEBS an d University means. Although the program does not have specific ACT or GPA admissions requirements, majors are required to pass MATH 116 College Algebra (or a higher math class) with a grade of C or better as a prerequisite to PSY 201 Statistics in Psychology and PSY 210 Experimental Psychology. 2. Indicators of Teaching and Advising Quality As indicated in Section III.F. of the Department Section, four Department faculty members received the CEBS Faculty Award for Teaching duri ng the period covered by this review, one received the University Faculty Award for Teaching, and one recei ved the KYVU Aw ard for Online Teaching. All of those faculty me mbers provide teaching support to this program. Three faculty members who support this program serve on the FaCET Advisory Board, and program faculty regularly participate in FaCET workshops. Most of the upper-division courses in the undergraduate psychology major are taught by faculty members who have active and productive research programs related to the content of those courses. This f aculty scholarship combined with a high rate of attendance at professional conferen ces helps to ensure faculty are kno wledgeable about current trends and research in their specialty areas. One faculty member who suppor ts this program received the CEBS Faculty Award for Student Advisement. In addition, the Department's advising coordinator regularly provides advisor training for new faculty both in the Department of Psychology and for faculty in other departments. During the initial registration period for each semester, the Department provides \"on call\" advising for undergraduate majors. The \"on call\" program ensures that at least two advisors are available to meet with students every afternoon for a 3 week period. Students responding to the WKUSES survey generally rated Department of Psychology faculty lower on the advising items than the University averages in spring 2002 and 2003, except for the item assessing their perception of advisors' knowledge of degree requirements. From spring 2004 through spring 2006, however, Department faculty members were rated about the same as the University Average.

Assessment of Currently Enrolled Students (Combined data for both undergraduate psychology majors, reference #591 and #760) The Department has a long history of using the Area Concentration Achievement Test to assess student learning in the undergraduate major and the assessment results were reported in the Department's 1990 and 1997 Academic Program Re view reports. During the 2002-2003 academic year, the Department developed explicit student learning outcomes and an associated assessment plan. Presented here are the 2005-06 learning outcomes, asse ssment plans, and assessment results, all of which are representative of those since 2002-03. Learning Outcome 1: Core Knowledge Base . Students completing the baccalaureate program in psychology at WKU will be knowledgeable in th e following core areas of the major: statistics, experimental design, tests and measurement, and history and systems of psychology. Assessment Plan . (a) The core knowledge base will be assessed by the corresponding subject area tests on the Area Concentration Achievement Test (ACAT). Statistics will be assessed each year because there is no separate ACAT sub-test for tests and measurement, and some of that content will be assessed by the statistics subtest. History and systems a nd experimental methods will be assessed in alternate years. The overall av erage score of prospective B.A. graduates on the core knowledge subtests of the ACAT will be at or above 50% correct, and the average score on both individual subtests will also be at least 50% correct. (b) On the graduating student questionnaire, 75% of the students will indicate th at their preparation was good or excellent in statistics, experimental design, tests and measurement, and history and systems. Assessment Results . (a) All criteria were met by the first means of assessment. A total of 77 students took the ACAT Statistics and History & Syst ems sub-tests either in fall, 2005 (n = 45) or spring, 2006 (n = 32). Overall m ean scores on the two subtests were 56.57% correct and 52.7% correct, respectively, both of which are above the 50% target. The average of the two sub-tests was 54.6%, above the target average of 50%. (b ) The assessment criterion was also met by the second means of assessment. There were 37 graduating senior questionnaires returned. The percentages of students indicating that their preparation was good or excellent in statistics, experimental design, tests and measurement, and history and systems were 77%, 79%, 74%, and 91%, respectively. These results do not indicate a need for program changes at this time. Learning Outcome 2: Category Knowledge Base I . Students completing the baccalaureate program in psychology at WKU will be knowledgeab le in each of the following three categories from which required courses are selected: Developmental; Social, Industrial-Organizational, Motivation; and Abnormal/Personality. 60 Assessment Plan . (a) Category will be asse ssed by an approp riate ACAT area subtest covering two of the three categories each year. Tests will be selected from among the Developmental subtest for the Developmental categor y, either the Social or Animal Learning and Motivation subtest for the Social/Industrial-Orga nizational/Motivation category, and either the Abnormal or Personality subtest for the Abnorma l/Personality category. For fall 2005 and spring 2006 the subtests to be used will be developm ental and abnormal. The overall average score of prospective B.A. graduates on these subtests w ill be at or above 50% correct, and the average score on both individual subtests will also be at least 50% correct. (b.) On the graduating student questionnaire, 75% of the students will indicate th at their preparation was good or excellent in each category area. Assessment Results . (a) For the first means of assessment, the target score on the ACAT of 50% correct was met or exceeded on the Abnormal Psychology and Developmental Psychology subtests, with scores of 68.5% and 57.1%, respec tively. The overall averag e score of prospective B.A. graduates on these subtests (62.8%) also exceeded the 50% correct ta rget. (b) The assessment criterion was also met by the second means of a ssessment. The percentages of students indicating their preparation was good or excellent in the Developmental; Social, Industrial-Organizational, Motivation; 80%, and 94%, respectively. Learning Outcome 3: Category Knowledge Base II . Students completing the baccalaureate program in psychology at WKU will be knowledgeable in both of the following categories from which required courses are selected: Biopsychology and Learning/Cognition. Assessment Plan : (a) Category knowledge will be asse ssed by an approp riate ACAT area subtest covering one course from both categories each year. This will be either the Physiological or Sensation and Perception subtest for the Biopsychology category and the Human Learning and Cognition subtest for the Learning/Cognition category. The subtests to be used in fall 2005 and spring 2006 will be Sensation and Perception, and Human Learning and Cognition. The overall average score of prospective B.A. graduates on these subtests will be at or above 50% correct, and the average score on individual subtests will also be at least 50% correct. (b) On the graduating student questionnaire, 75% of the students will indicate that their preparation was good or excellent in each category area. Assessment Results . (a) For the first means of assessment, the target score on the ACAT of 50% correct was not met on either the Human Le arning and Cognition or Sensation & Perception sub-tests, with scores of 35.3%, and 48.2%, resp ectively. (b) On the second means of assessment, the assessment criterion was met. The percentage of students indicating their preparation was good or excellent in biopsychology and learning/cognition was 77%. For two consecutive years, the ACAT performance criteria were not met for th is category. The Department's Undergraduate Program Committee is currently reviewing these results to determine what steps to take to improve student learning in this area. QEP Learning Outcome 1 . The Department's Undergraduate Program Committee is working this fall to develop an assessment plan for the first QEP learning outcome. b. Other Indicators of Success Student Awards . During the period covered by this review, a number of students have been recognized for award-winning pr esentations at various student research conferences. These include: Melinda Lalonde , 1st Place Award, paper presentation, Undergraduate Psychology, Anthropology, Sociology, and mathematics session, 2006 WKU Sigma XI Student Research Conference Neal Rikal , 3rd Place Award, poster presentation, 2006 WKU Sigma XI Student Research Conference 61 Gina Leclere & Jessica Rumsey , Honorable Mention Award, poster presentation, 2006 WKU Sigma XI Student Research Conference Timothy Thornberry , 1st Place Award, undergraduate paper presentation, 2005 WKU Sigma XI Student Research Conference Sarah Janes , Chris Chandler , & Amy Baird , 2nd Place Ernest Meyer Award for Undergraduate Research, 2005 Kentucky Psychological Association Student research Competition Amy Baird , 3rd Place Award, undergraduate paper presentation, 2005 WKU Sigma XI Student research Conference Amy Baird , 1st Place Award, undergraduate paper pres entation, 2004 Kentucky Academy of Science meeting Allison Dyrlund , & Steve Wininger, 1st Place Award in the Biology and Psychology paper session, 2004 WKU Sigma Xi Student Research Conference A team of three students won the 2nd Place Award in the 2004 Kentucky Psychological Association quiz bowl competition Eric Reinke & Amanda Howard , 2nd Place poster award, 2004 Kentucky Psychological Association Student Research Competition Amy Schirmer , Honorable Mention Award, paper presentation, 2003 WKU Sigma XI Student Research Conference Ken Brasel , & Amanda Howard , 2nd Place Award, undergraduate paper presentation, 2003 Kentucky Psychological Association Student Research Competition Chriscelyn Snell & Bridget Wilfert , 1st Place Award, paper presentation, 2002 Kentucky Psychological Association Student Research Competition Jessica Ritchie, Stacey Carnes-Darst, Rachel Ezell , & Erica Hightower , 2nd Place Award, poster presentation, 2002 Kentucky Psychological Association meeting Students Graduating with Honors : As can be seen in Table 22 below, a substantial number of psychology majors graduate with honors each year. The number graduating with honors has fluctuated across years, and has ranged from 21% of total graduates to as high as 41%. The weighted mean across all 5 years show in Table 22 is 34%. Table 22: Number of Psychology Majors Graduating with Honors (Combined data for both undergraduate psychol ogy majors, reference #591 and #760, and first 2004/05 2005/06 7 8 14 Summa Cum Laude 9 12 9 6 11 8 Cum Laude 5 11 8 7 10 16 Totals 18 33 24 20 29 38 Percent of Graduates 21% 41% enrollments (summer sessions excluded) in PSY 290 Supervised Study in Psychology, PSY 490 Research, Readings, or Special Projects in Psychology, and PS Y 390 Field Experience in Psychology Course 2000/01 2001/02 2002/03 2003/04 2004/05 PSY 290 & PSY 490 Independent Study 34 41 29 54 63 PSY 390 Field Experience 10 41 39 26 43 Totals 44 82 68 70 106 Independent Study Participation and Field Experience Participation . Students typically enroll in PSY 290 and PSY 490 to obtain course credit for independent projects, frequently research projects, supervised by faculty. Students enroll in PSY 390 to obtain experience in a setting outside of the university where concepts, practices and knowledge from the field of psychology are utilized, to learn about professional behavi or and ethics, and to learn about the linkages between theory and practice. As Table 23 shows, the Department's efforts to promote student engagement in the discipline by encouraging enrollment in these courses has been quite successful. Independent study participation has increased by 85% sin ce the 2000-01 academic year, and Field Experience participation has increas ed by 330%. These increases can be attributed to the efforts by Department faculty to actively recr uit students to participate in these courses. The Department utilizes a brochure, class announcements, special PSY 390 orientation meetings, and a web site (http://edtech.tph.wku.edu/ ~ejones/psy390/homepage.htm) to recruit students into the Field Experience course. The effort to recruit students into PSY 290 and PSY 490 is less systematic and more varied across faculty; recruitment efforts involve both faculty encouraging students to get involved and students seeking such opportunities. The Department maintains a web site that describes various res earch opportunities for students (http://edtech.tph.wku.edu/~psy ch/research_frame.htm). Student Publications and Presentations . The list of faculty publications presented above identifies 44 undergraduate student co-authors. During the period covered by this review, a very substantial number of students have co-authored professional conference presentations with faculty their research mentors, and many students have presented on their own at student research conferences. c. Program Graduates The Department does not systematically track program graduates and consequently cannot provide any information about the number of graduates employed in psychology or the number that achieve professional success. However, the number that would be employed in areas directly related to the major would necessarily be quite small because a master's degree is generally the minimum qualification for employment in areas directly related to psychology. Approximately 20% of the graduates each year enter grad uate school or professional school. d. Indicators of Student Engagement Undergraduate student engagement in the Department of Psychology is promoted by actively encouraging and recruiting st udents to work with faculty on resear ch projects, to participate in the psychology field experience course, and to seek out volunteer service opportunities through the Alive Center. All of these activities engage students with communities (e.g., research professionals, practitioners, and community agencies) other than their own and provide purposeful learning opportunities that enhance their potential to contribute to community and society. In addition to this comprehensive student engagement initiative, several individual faculty members 63have incorporated service-learning activities into their courses. The Department maintains a web site to chronicle the engagement activities of students and to promote and advertise engagement opportunities (http://edtech.wku.edu/~psych/engagement_frame.htm). The Department also makes use of a brochure and special orientation sessions to recruit students to the fi eld experience course, and maintains a web site to recruit partic ipants to its NSF-supported Research Experience for Undergraduates program ( http://edt ech.tph.wku.edu/~smutter/REUIndex.htm). The work of Department of Psychology faculty member Dr. Katrina Phelps, with support from the U.S. Department of Justice, led to th e creation of the ALIVE Center. The Department of Psychology contributed $20,000 to assist with Western's purchase of the ALIVE Center building. The Department is in the process of developing assessment plans to assess the undergraduate program learning outcomes associated with the QEP. C. Other Indicators of Program Achiev ement and Contribution to the Mission and Success of the University 1. Program Viability (Evidence that the program attracts, recruits, and retains high quality students, and evidence concerning enrollment trends in psychology.) Evidence that the program attracts and recruits hi gh quality students can be seen in the ACT and GPA data presented in Table 19. Mean ACT scores and the mean GPA of psychology majors are both higher than the corresponding University means. The substantial number of psychology majors graduating with honors (Table 22) is also an indicator of the high quality of the students. According to data from the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics, psychology degrees were 4.5% of all Bachelor's degrees awarded by U.S. degree granting institutions in 1980-81. By 1990-91, psychology degr ees were 5.4% of all Bachelor's degrees, and by 2000-01, that percentage had rise n to 5.9%. For 2002-03, the most recent year for which NCES data are available, psychology degrees were 5.8% of all Bachelor's degrees awarded. NCES data also show that among science and engineering fields, which comprise 31.8% of all Bachelor's degrees awarded in 2001, psychology ranks third behind biology and a broad category of social sciences. In 2001, 18.5% of all science and engineering degrees were in psychology. Given the steady growth in the popularity of psychology as a major in the U.S. and at Western, it is expected that the number of students electing to major in psychology at Western will continue to grow, and psychology will very likely remain one of the more popular majors at Western. 2.

In each academic year from 2001 /02 to 2005/06, the Department of Psychology consistently offered about 110 class sections of General Ed ucation courses and service courses that fulfill requirements for other undergraduate majors and minors. Although the number of course sections remained fairly constant across this period, the SCHP from those courses increased by 12%. As can be seen, Psychology makes a very substantial contribution to the University's General Education Program with three cour ses in the Social and Behavioral Sciences category (PSY 100 Introduction to Psychology, PSY 199 Introduction to Life-Span Developmental Psychology, and PSY 350 Social Psychology), and one course in the Health and Wellness Category (PSY 250 Adjustment and Personal Growth). Psychology regularly offers over 80 sections of General Education Program courses each academic year, courses that generate in excess of 10,000 SCH. Two undergraduate courses, PSY 310 Educational Psychology (required for all teacher education majors), and PSY 421 Psychology of Early Ad olescence (required for Middle Grades Education majors), are offered as service courses for the teacher education programs. The Psychology Department offers about 20 sections of PSY 310 and 2-4 sections of PSY 421 each AY. Those courses typically generate in excess of 2,000 SCH. Other service courses include a.) PSY 345 Psyc hology of Sexuality, a required course in the Sexuality Studies minor; b.) PSY 430 Psychology of Women, a restricted elective in the Women's Studies minor; c.) PSY 423 Psychology of Adult Life and Aging, a core requirement in the Gerontology minor, and d.) PSY 475 Grant Writing, a restricted elective in the American Humanics minor. During the period covered by this review, the Department of Psychology also offered at least one honors section of both PSY 100 and PSY 199 each AY, and a psychology faculty member offered the honors Human Rights colloquium each year. 3. Use of Technology (Program use of appropriate t echnology to enhance learning and use of technology to provide alternat ive delivery to time/place-bound learners.) Dr. Leroy Metze, Professor of Psychology and Director of the CEBS Educational Technology Center, has been a University leader in the development and use of technology to enhance learning. Since 2001, Dr. Metze has had substantial (about $1 million/year) funding from the U.S. Department of Education for educational technology initiatives. Every classroom used by the Department of Psychology is equipped with a dedicated computer, internet connection, and projector. Several classrooms also have smart boards and document cameras. 65Department faculty make extensive use of this technology to deliver course content. The vast majority of faculty at least occasionally use PowerPoint pr esentations, and many facu lty incorporate video and internet resources into their instrutional delivery. During the period covered by this review, at least one section each of PSY 100 and PSY 370 Industrial/Organizational Psychology, have been of fered online each fall and spring semester. Other undergraduate courses that were periodically offered online include PSY 361, PSY 421, PSY 432, PSY 440, and PSY 450. 4. Uniqueness of Program: N/A 5. Contributions to Diversity Goals Two Department of Psychology faculty members, Dr. John O'Connor (the former department head), and Dr. John Brun i, have received the WKU President's Aw ard for Diversity. Du ring the period covered by this review, Dr. Jackie Pope-Tarrence has served as the faculty advi sor to the Black Student Alliance. She presented Diversity as an asset: Providing a continuum of learning opportunities for all students , at the meeting of the National School Board Association. Dr. Pope-Tarrence and Dr. Joyce Wilder presented Now that I'm out in the field: Student teaching and valuing diversity , at the meeting of the Midwestern Psychological Association in 2004 and subsequently published a journal article in The Teacher Educator on valuing diversity in the classroom. Dr. Pope-Tarrence, Dr. Wilder, and Dr. Kelly Madole presented a workshop on cultural dive rsity at the 2004 Kentucky State Services Corp Annual State Volunteer Conference. Dr. Pope-Tarrence received a $15,000 grant from the Kentucky Department of Education for a project on the minority achievement gap in Kentucky schools. She also served on the University Diversity Enhancement task force. Dr. Betsy Shoenfelt and Dr. Katrina Phelps have been actively involved in the WKU Girls in Science program. Dr. Shoenfelt has regularly taught classes for and conducted evaluations of the program, and Dr. Phelps has obtained CPE Action Fund awards to support the program and has taught classes for it. Dr. Shoenfelt also served on the NCAA Athletes Certification Interim Report Subc ommittee on Gender and Racial Equity. Dr. Kelly Madole has served on the University Diversity Committee and on the Univ ersity Diversity Awards Committee. Dr. John Bruni presented a 2004 FaCET workshop on Minority Retention Objectives. Dr. Bruni also organized and chaired the conference Strategies for Change: Et hnic Minorities in Kentucky Postsecondary Education held in Louisville in 2005; Patty Randolph and Sally Kuhlenschmidt presented papers at that conference. Dr. Shula Mu ssnug, Dr. Antony Norman , and Dr. Pitt Derryberry all taught educational psychology courses for students in Mexico City. Dr. Lakeisha Meyer and Dr. Kelly Madole presented a workshop at the 2006 CE BS Professional Development day on \"Discussing Racial Issues in the classroom.\" Dr . Tony Paquin taught two study abroad classes in summer, 2006. Dr. John Bruni is in the process of developing the REDAIM system with the Office Student Enrollment. The REDAIM system is designed to provide near-real predictions of students at risk of dropping out, including a focus on African-American retention; providing meaningful information at the levels of individual student, department, and college, as well as for the university. The system integrates data from multiple campus sources and provides immediate predictions for individuals. REDAIM therefore provides a unique tool for planning and implementing programs designed to retain diverse groups students. In addition to the activities identified above, Department of Psychology faculty regularly incorporate instruction about diversity issues into their classes. Some specific examples include the following. Dr. Carrie Pritchard regularly uses information from journals and books in her classes to emphasize how culture affects values and behaviors in the realms of parenting, teaching, and other socialization practices. She includes popular film and discussion to illustrate these differences and to highlight how such differences might be adaptive and healthy in one cultural setting, even if they are surprising to some of us. Dr. Kathi Miner-Rubino discusses the contributions of female psychologists in PSY 100. In PSY 430 Psychology of Women, she talks about diversity in race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and to a lesser extent culture, social class, disability, and religion for every topic. Some 66topics where diversity is central include motherhood, sexuality, love and relationships, violence against women, media representation, and work. In her PSY 350 Social Psychology class she has discussions about diversity and gender issues in depth, especially regarding aggression, person perception, helping behavior, and relationships. The issue of culture is also prevalent across topi cs. Faculty who teach PSY 199 Life-Span Developmental Psychology and PSY 321 Child Developmental Psychology highlight cross-cultural and sub-cultural influences on developmental diversity for all course topics. Dr. John Bruni has integrated issues of diversity into his cu rriculum for the statistics, experimental design, and measurement classes. Differences between genders and among minority groups are discussed in terms of individual difference position variables that either need to be controlled or incorporated for modeling as predictors, mediators or moderators. Divers ity within the context of these classes is treated as an important consideratio n for effective research. Finally, the following Department of Psychology courses are ones in which diversity issues are an integral component of the course: PSY 345 Psychology of Sexuality, PSY 355 Cross Cultural Psychology, PSY 350 Social Psychology, PSY 423 Psychology of Adult Life and Aging, PSY 430 Psychology of Women, PSY 440 Abnormal Psychology, PSY 450 Introduction to Personality Theories, and PSY 485 Psychology of Religion. 6. Accreditation Status There is no accreditation status available for undergraduate psychology programs. 7. Planning, Development, and Other Areas: N/A 8. Additional Indicators for Career Preparation Programs: N/A D. Factors Inhibiting Program Achi evement and Contribution: N/A E. Response to Previous Progr am Reviews or Other Assessments The only concern expressed in res ponse to the previous program review was the extent to which the Department relied on part-time faculty. As noted above in the Department Section of this report, utilization of part-time faculty on the main campus has remained co nstant over the past 5 year s. Most of the increase in part-time faculty use has been at the extended campus sites and has occurred in response to enrollment growth. Most of those part-time faculty hold the doctorate in psychology. F. Future Directions: (Briefly discuss plans or future di rections for the program that have been developed by the faculty and administ rators of the program. Are the plans documented in the University 's Strategic Planning Process? Where is the program headed? What are its most pressing needs? What are its opportunities for enhancement and/or improvement? What resources (in ge neral) are needed to realize plans?) There are no plans at this time for program changes. 67Undergraduate Program Section Program: Psychology Extended Major A.B.

We ar e pleased to note that the average ACT score and average high school GPA of students in the extended psychology major are both considerably higher than those of students in the General Major (which, in turn, were higher than the CEBS and University averages). As the number of students in the Extend ed Major has increased, their average ACT score and GPA have decreased somewhat, but it is too early to identify that as a trend. E. Table 28: Undergraduate GPAs of Program Graduates Average 3.05 3.07 3.09 3.08 3.11 The average GPA of program (Extended Major) gradua tes was higher than the University average, and for 2004/05 it was higher than the CEBS average; for bo th years it was higher than for the General Major.

Mission Statement/Relation of Program to University Mission (This was addressed in the description of the General Major; it is not unique for the Extended Major.) B. Teaching and Learning 1. Undergraduate Students As indicated by the data in Table 27 above, students in the Extended Major have ACT scores and high school GPAs that are generally higher than the CEBS and University means. The program does not have specific ACT admissions requirements, but majors are required to pass MATH 116 College Algebra (or a higher math class) with a grade of C or better as a prerequisite to PSY 201 Statistics in Psychology and PSY 210 Experimental Psychology, and are expected to maintain a 2.50 GPA both overall and in psychology. 2.

Program Enrollment and Student Data A. Table 28: Number of Majors Fall 2001 Fall 2002 Fall 2003 Fall 2004 Fall 2005 Majors 49 52 50 54 59 The number of majors in the Department of Psychology master's degree program increased by 20% from 2001 to 2005. This increase is largely attributable to the hiring of new faculty in clinical psychology and educational psychology and a co rresponding increase in the number of graduate students that can be accommodated in the program. Factor s limiting future growth were discussed above under enrollment trends in Department Section II.A. It should be noted that the number of majors shown in Table 28 is for the main campus. As discussed previously, the decreased graduate-level SCHP shown in Table 1 occurred at the extended campus sites. The Psychology M.A. Program is among the top 15 Graduate majors at Western, and is one of only six of those top 15 that has experienced a stea dy increase in enrollment since fall 2001. B. Table 29: Number of Graduates 2000/01 2001/02 2002/03 2003/04 2004/05 Degrees Awarded 15 21 15 24 21 Not surprisingly, as the number of majors has increased, the number of degrees awarded has shown a corresponding increase. Students are admitted to th e program through a competitive process that selects students on criteria that predict success. Cons equently, the program has a high completion rate.

Students are admitted as a cohort to start classes in the fall semester each year. There we re 20 students admitted in fall 2001 and 18 (90%) have graduated. The fall 2002 cohort consisted of 22 students, and 17 (77%) have graduated. Of the 22 students admitted for fall 2003, 19 (86%) have graduated. Finally, there were 28 students admitted for fall 2004. Although only 17 have so far graduated, we know that seven students are still working on their thesis and are expected to gradua te. In that event, 24 the 28 (86%) who started the program in fall 2004 will have graduated. Most of the students who do not complete the program leave voluntarily during or shortly after the first semester. The high rate of program completion reflects favorably on the program selection criteria and the quality of the students who are admitted. 71C. Comparisons with External Data Table 31: Program Enrollments at Kentucky Public Universities WKU 52 2 2003 50 4 2004 54 N/A 11 6 N/A 34 2005 59 25 N/A 8 1 N/A Source: Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE). Western's master's degree program in psychology is the largest such program in Kentucky. (Note: Eastern Kentucky University has had a well-estab lished psychology master's degree program with concentrations in clinical psychology, industrial/organizational psychology, and general psychology throughout the period covered by this review. Conse quently, we question the a ccuracy of the CPE data reported for EKU as well as the comparison between WKU and EKU on number of students enrolled in their psychology master's degree program. According to personal correspondence with the chair of the Department of Psychology at Easter n Kentucky University, and data prov ided by him from EKU's Office of Institutional Research, the number of students enrolled in EKU's master's program in psychology in each year from 2001 to 2004 was 28, 39, 38, and 38, respectively. For fall 2005, they report 69 enrolled.) Table 32: Degrees Conferred by Kentucky Public Universities WKU 0 26 Source: Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE). Except for 2004/05, Western conferred more master's degrees in psychology than any other Kentucky public university (but see the note at the end of this paragraph). Western's program requires 48 graduate credit hours, and typically takes 2 full academic year s to complete. Because both first-year and second- year students are counted in the program enrollment total for each year, the number of graduates will necessarily be about one-half or less of the enrollment total for any year. In contrast, the psychology master's degree program at the University of Loui sville is only a 30 credit-hour program and can be completed in about 1 year. (Note: For the same reason stated above, we question the accuracy of the CPE data reported for EKU as well as the comparison between WKU and EKU on number of psychology master's program graduates. Personal correspondence with the chair of the Department of Psychology at EKU, and data provided by him from EKU's Office of Institutional Research, confirms that the EKU psychology master's degree program had graduates during the period from 2000 through 2004. The numbers of graduates for 2000/01 through 2003/04 reported by EKU's Office of Institutional Research were 10, 15, 17, and 14, respectively. For 2004/05, they report 29 graduates.) 72D.

The maximum score is 1600. The mean GRE scores of students admitted to the psychology M.A. program from 2001 through 2005 were consistently higher than the corresponding CEBS and University means. The psychology 5-year average is more than a standard deviation above th e CEBS 5-year average, and is about one standard deviation higher than the University 5-year average. Thes e data are indicative of the relative high quality of the students admitted to th e psychology M.A. program. The mean GRE score of students admitted in fall 2005 was considerably higher than for previous years, and the mean increased for 2 003 to 2005. However, because of the small sample size and inherent variability in applicant GRE scores, it would be premature to consider that to be indicative of an upward trend. Table 34: Undergraduate GPAs of Students Admitted to the Program Avg. Ugrad GPA Fall 2001 Fall 2002 Fall 2003 Fall 2004 Fall 2005 Mean Psychology M.A. 3.27 3.50 Table shows that for 2001 through 2005 the mean GPAs of students admitted to the psychology M.A program were consistently higher than the corre sponding CEBS and University means. Moreover, the 5-year average of psychology M.A. students was about two-tenths of a point higher than the 5-year CEBS and University averages. These data are indicative of the relative high quality of the students admitted to the psychology M.A. program.

The maximum score is 6400. From 2001 through 2005, students admitted to the psychology M.A. program had consistently higher mean GAP scores than the corresponding CEBS and Un iversity means. Moreover , the 5-year average of psychology students was more than 600 points above the 5-year average for CEBS and almost 500 points higher than the University 5-year average. These da ta are indicative of the relative high quality of the students admitted to the psychology M.A. program. 73E. Table 36: Graduate GPAs of Program Graduates 3.72 The mean GPA of psychology M.A. program graduates is high and essentially the same as the CEBS and University means. Given the competitive proces s and selection criteria used for admission to the psychology M.A. program, it is not surprising that program graduates have high GPAs. II. Program Description and Self Study A. Mission Statement/Relation of Program to University Mission 1. Clinical Concentration This concentration follows the scientist/practitioner model of training and prepares students to be successful at performing both research and therapy. The program is practice or iented, offering a broad foundation for the professional who will provide a wide variety of psychological services at the M.A. level in mental health centers, rehabilitation cente rs, college counseling centers, and various other mental health agencies. The program also prepares students for continuation in a Ph.D. program and to take the licensing examine required to practice psychology in many states. 2. Experimental Concentration This concentration is designed to prepare students for positions where strong research and methodological skills are needed and/or for contin uation in a Ph.D. program. Research opportunities are available in cognition, perception, child deve lopment, gerontology, social psychology, sport psychology, and educational psychology. Strong training in statistical and methodological skills is provided. 3. General Concentration This concentration is designed for students who desire a terminal master's degree in psychology or who plan to pursue doctoral studies in specialties other than clinical, experimental, or industrial/organizational psychology . 4. Industrial/Organizational Concentration The Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology concentration follows the scientist/practitioner model of training which teaches students to evalua te and apply theory and research. Students are prepared for careers in business, industry, serv ice organizations, consulting firms or government agencies. Applied skills are taught through the integration of practical experience and formal coursework. Graduates of the pr ogram are prepared to enter th e workforce as human resource professionals or to continue their graduate education in a doctoral program. B. Teaching and Learning 1.

The target cohort size is about 8-10 students. Typically, offe rs of acceptance go out to the to p 10 or so candidates in late March and early April. Offers ar e then made to additional viable candidates to offset those who decline an offer of acceptance. Admission to the clin ical concentration is qu ite selective with only about one-half of applicants being admitted, and only about one-third of applicants enrolling. The mean GRE score and mean undergraduate GPA of applicants who enroll are both considerably higher than the corresponding means for all clini cal concentration applicants. The mean GPA of students who enroll in the clinical concentration is the same as that for the psychology M.A. program as a whole, but the mean GRE score is slightly lower (1009 vs. 1037). Table 38: Experimental Concentration Selectivity Number of Students Average GPA Average GRE Year Applied Accepted Enrolled GPA Apps GPA Accept GPA Enroll GRE Apps GRE Accept GRE Enroll 2001 8 7 5 3.20 3.25 3.24 1100 1116 1138 2002 10 8 7 3.56 3.64 1038 3.40 1088 1097 1090 2006 13 12 9 3.37 3.36 3.31 1105 1103 1081 Ave. 3.43 3.38 1090 1098 1088 75From 2001 through 2005, the Experimental Concentration in the M.A. program averaged 9 applicants per year, accepted an average of 8, and enrolled an average of 6. The target cohort size for this concentration varies from 7 to 9 students based on the number of faculty who are available to direct theses. Selectivity is somewhat limited due to the relatively small number of applicants. Despite this, students enrolled in this concentration compared favorably with graduate students in the department, college, and university as a wh ole. Specifically, the average undergraduate GPA for students in the Experimental Concentration was similar to the overall average for students in the Psychology M.A. program (3.40 vs. 3.42) and the average GRE score for these students was higher than the overall average for students in the M.A. program (1090 vs. 1037). In addition, both the average undergraduate GPA and the average GRE score were higher for students in the Experimental Concentration than for graduate students in the college and university as a whole (see Table 33 above).

The number enrolled in each cohort has remained fairly stab le, not only over the past 6 y ears, but also over the 30+ year history of the concentration. Duri ng the period covered by this review, the I/O received an average of 25 applications per year, admitted about 15 of those applicants, and enrolled 8 to 9. The fact that the applicant numbers have remained stable is impressive given that the number of I/O master's programs has increased exponentially over the past two decades. In 1983, there were fewer than 15 master's level I/O programs. In 1993, Lowe identified 55 master's level I/O programs. Currently, the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP) web page lists just over 100 (non-distance learning) master's programs in I/O psychology in the United States. In practice, the I/O admission procedure is a top down procedure in which the top 9 students in the applicant pool are admitted. Once notice is received from those students of accepting or declining the offer of admission, another round of applicants is admitted in an effort to bring enrollees up to 8 or 9. This iterative process allows us to track where those students we accept, but who decline our offer, actually enroll. Typically, tw o to three of those students enroll in doctoral programs and the others enroll in other I/O master's programs. Our biggest competitor at the master's level is the program at Middle Tenne ssee State (which has seven full-time I/O faculty, compared to three at Western, an d enrolls 12 students a year). The students that we accept and those that actually enroll do not differ significantly in terms of GRE Verbal + Quantitative Scores ( M Enroll = 1052; M Accept = 1072). Stud ents accepted into 76the I/O program have significantly higher GRE scores ( M = 1072) than our applicant pool ( M = 975). The students we accept, those that enroll, an d the applicant pool have similar undergraduate GPAs ( M = 3.4) There are no selectivity data for the General Concentration of the psychology M.A. program because students are not actively recruited into that program. b. Description of Students Clinical concentration . Of the 53 students who began the clinical psychology concentration in the M.A. program between 2001 and 2006, 52 (98%) of them attended the university full time. More of the clinical concentration students (3 8%) obtained their undergraduate degree from Western Kentucky University than from other universities, and another 23 percent completed their undergraduate degree at another Kentucky university. However, students were recruited nationally, and 42% of all applicants were from states other than Kentucky. Approximately 59% of the students enter the program with some form of clinical experience. Representative experiences include working as a Mental Health Associate at Rivendell (a n adolescent inpatient psychiatric facility), working as an alcohol and drug counselor, counseling adolescent girls at Spectrum Care, working at a crisis stabilization unit, working in the office of a psychologist who specializes in treating domestic violence and se xual offenses, working with abused children through the Center for Child and Family Services , working with sexual abuse victims at Hope Harbor, working as an office manager for a psychiatrist, completing behavioral assessments and treatments with children who have autism, working with adolescents who are in the state's custody, working as a mental health worker at an inpatient psychiatric facility, and working as a sexual assault prevention advocate. In addition, approximately 64% of the admitted students had research experience prior to their admission to th e program, and 36% had presented their research at local, regional or national conferences. The research topics included an examination of risky and healthy behaviors in college students, parenting styles, African American students' perceptions of the campus climate, religiosity an d academic performance, issues pertaining to men's body image, how other people perceive athletes and stereotyping of athletes, the benefits of pet ownership, the effectiveness of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, examining hearing via animal stud ies (rats), attachment issues in middle childhood, parenting style and the development of eating disorders, the inter actions between children and parents, correlates of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, eating disorders and disordered eating within a sorority setting, the Stroop effect, alcohol consumption and personality, and cognitive styles of children with Attention-Defi cit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Experimental concentration . Each of the twenty-nine students who enrolled in the Experimental Psychology concentration in the M.A. program between 2001 and 2005 attended the university full time (100%). Fourteen (48%) of th ese students obtained an undergraduate degree from Western Kentucky University, two (7%) obtained the degree from another Kentucky university, 12 (41%) obtained a degree from a state other than Kentucky, and one (3%) obtained a degree from a university outside the United States . At least 11 (38%) of these students had research experience prior to their admission to the program and five of these had presented their research at local, regional, or national conferences or had co-authored journal articles with faculty. I/O Concentration . The WKU Industrial/Organizational Psychology graduate program has earned a national reputation. More than half of our enrollees are from out of state. Of the 51 students who enrolled in the I/O concentration of the M.A. program between 2001and 2006, only 12 (23.5%) were WKU undergraduates; ten others graduated from Kentucky schools, including six from the University of Kentucky and the Univer sity of Louisville. The majority of the students who enrolled in the I/O program during this time period came from 16 states other than Kentucky including Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, and Tennessee. Undergradu ate institutions included Purdue, Iowa State, South Florida, Bowling Green State, Georgia, State, and the University of Tennessee. Most of our 77students enroll in our program directly after earning their undergraduate degree; a few have one to five years of work experience beyond the bachelor's degree. All (100%) of the graduate students in the I/O concentration enroll as full-time students. c. Information about Graduate Assistantships From fall 2001 through fall 2005, graduate assistantships were offered to 112 of the 148 students admitted into the Psychology M.A. Program. The vast majority of those students continued on an assistantship for their second year in the program. The Office of Graduate Studies provided funding each year for a to tal of only 18 graduate assist antships in the Department of Psychology to support students in both the M.A. and Ed.S. graduate programs. That office also provided funding each year thr ough the Minority Assistantship Program for an additional 2-3 assistantships. Almost all of the remaining assistantships were funded by faculty grants and internally by the Department of Psychology from grant salary savings and lapse salary. The Department uses a priority system for a ssigning graduate assistant duties with the top priorities being a.) the assignment of two students in the clinical concentration to the University Counseling and Testing Center, b.) the assignment of students to assist faculty with labor intensive courses such as the large auditorium sections of PSY 100 and PSY 560 Assessment of Cognitive and Intellectual Functioning, and c.) staffing for the Educational Technology Center. The second priority is the assignment of students to indivi dual faculty to provide assistance with teaching (typically grading, recording grades, finding or developing resources, etc. ), research (recruiting and running participants, data entry, data an alysis, writing research reports), and service (University committees, working with local agenci es and businesses, data entry and analysis, writing technical reports, etc.). Usually, several students are assi gned each year to units outside the Department. These have included Early Child hood Education, the Literacy Clinic, FaCET, Human Resources, the Office of International Prog rams, and Center for Leadership Excellence. The students in the CLE were instrumental in developing and administering the CLE Leadership Assessment Center. The graduate assistantship assignments employed by the Department of Psychology provide valuable learning opportunities for students as well as opportunities for them to become engaged with communities other than their own. For ex ample, students in the clinical concentration assigned to the Counseling and Testing Center work directly with clients (under supervision) to provide assessments and counseling services, and others work under supervision to provide such services through the Psychology Training Clinic. This applied experience involves mentoring by faculty who model appropriate professional demeanor and behavior. These experiences provide learning opportunities directly related to the stude nts' program of study. For many of the graduate assistants, at least a portion of their assign ment involves working with faculty on research projects. In particular, the expe rimental concentration seeks to increase students' competitiveness for admission to highly reputable doctoral programs and for jobs that require strong research and quantitative skills. Assistantships are therefore used to give students extensive training in research methodology and statistical analysis techniques as well as the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a research setting. During the period of this review, all experimental concentration students were assigned to work for 20 hours/week in the research laboratories of faculty members affiliated with the Experimental Psychology concentration of the M.A. program. Moreover, all students conducting thesis research were assigned for at least one academic year to the faculty member who served as their thesis advisor. While that is at the core of the training for students in the experimental concentration, it is also an integral component of the scientist/practitioner model of training for clinical and I/O students. The WKU I/O concentration is honored to have participated since 1988 in the Research Fellows Program of the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area and the U.S. Army Research In stitute Field Unit at Fort Knox. This program provides funding for one to three I/O graduate students each year. The gr aduate student fellows participate in cutting edge research evaluating multi-billion dollar military performance simulators at Ft. Knox. 78 2. Indicators of Teaching and Advising Quality As indicated in Section III.F. of the Department Section, four Department faculty members received the CEBS Faculty Award fo r Teaching during the period cove red by this review, one received the University Faculty Award for Teaching, and one received the KYVU Award for Online Teaching. All of those faculty members prov ide teaching support to this pr ogram. Two faculty members who support this program serve on the FaCET Advisory Board, and program faculty regularly participate in FaCET workshops. Most program courses are taught by faculty members who have active and productive research programs related to the conten t of those courses. This faculty scholarship combined with a high rate of attendance at prof essional conferences help s to ensure faculty are knowledgeable about current trends and research in their specialty areas. One faculty member who supports this program received the CEBS Faculty Award for Student Advisement. Students in the clinical MA program are closely observed while they begin their applied training in both assessment and therapy. In addition, all second-year studen ts receive hands-on experience in the Psychology Training Clinic, where they are engaged in completing assessments for learning disabilities, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and other personality issues with undergraduate students and members of the Bowling Green community. The clinical concentration coordinator serves as academic advisor for all clinical students. Advising is often conducted in a group format b ecause there are not many electives available to the students. The coordinator meets with all of the incoming students during the first week of class to get to know them and obtain an idea of their career goals. At that time, the thesis process is discussed, and the students' research interests are discussed. Students are also directed to a thesis chair at that time. This aspect of advising early in the program increases the likelihood that students will complete a thesis and complete the program. 3. Indicators of Student Learning a. Assessment of Currently Enrolled Students During the 2002-2003 academic year, the Department developed explicit student learning outcomes and associated assessment plans for each of the M.A. concentrations. Presented here are the 2005-06 learning outcomes, assessment plan s, and assessment results, all of which are representative of those since 2002-03. Clinical Concentration Learning Outcome 1.

Each of these seven theses were rated as good or excellent by th e committee members. Of the remaining two, one defended in April but had a number of required revisions. The second student is working on revisions. Thus, the success rate of theses for this class currently stands at 77.7%. However, it is expected that when the two remaining theses are completed, they will be judged to be \"good\" by the committee members. (b) All nine of the students completed an internship and submitted a technical report describing the conditions and out comes of their internship. 100% of these reports were judged to have passed the cr iteria for acceptability. The data do not indicate a need to revise the program at this time. Learning Outcome 4: Students completing the program will successfully find employment that utilizes their I/O training. Assessment Plan . 90% of the students who complete the program, and who seek I/O-related employment, will find such employment within one year of graduation. Assessment Results . 100% of the class of I/O students who graduated in May 2005 secured I/O-related employment within twelve months of graduation. Among those are positions in the Pentagon, with the US Census Bureau, with Ga ylord Entertainment, Metro-Louisville, and a DC- based consulting firm. Of the seven student who graduated in May 2006 (i.e., those who have completed their thesis), one is enrolling in an doctoral program, three have employment in I/O- related jobs, and three are still in the job search process. One of the 2006 students who has not completed his thesis has also found I/O-related employment and will begin working full-time in August. The data do not indicate a need to revise the program at this time. General Concentration The Department of Psychology does not generally admit students to the general concentration, nor do we actively recruit studen ts for that concentration. We are currently in the process of determining whether to modify or eliminate th e general concentration in the M.A. program. Because the number of students in this concentr ation is very small, the Department has not developed learning outcomes and assessment plans for it. 82b. Other Indicators of Success (Evidence of student achievement and success, such as special experiences/projects, honors, publications, presentations, internship placements, number of students in thesis versus non-thesis options and thesis titles) Clinical Concentration There have been 19 master's theses completed by students in the clinical concentration of the psychology M.A. program in the past 5 years. In that same time period, only four students have elected to take the non-thesis option. Thus, 83% of the students completed theses. The thesis titles are shown below. 2002 A Comparison of Symptom Severity Between University Counseling Center and Community Mental Health Center Clients Eating Disorder Symptoms in Women Living in Residence Halls and Off-Campus Parental Understanding of Miranda Rights Potential Antecedents of Muscle Dysmorphia The Differences in Levels of Spirituality between At-Risk Youths Who Have Been Adjudicated and At-Risk Youths Who Have Not Been Adjudicated The Negative Effects of Media Advertis ements on Men's Body Satisfaction The Relationships Between Sport Fandom, Identification with a Specific Team, and an Individual's Socialization Experiences 2003 Exploration of the Relationship Between Moral Judgment Development and Crystallized Intelligence Minimizing the Time of Day Effect Th rough the Use of Background Music The Effects of Self-Monitoring and Religious Self-Discrepancies on Negative Affect 2004 Actual and Ideal Self-Discrep ancy and Body Satisfaction An Examination of the Five Factors of Personality, Pubertal Onset and Alcohol Usage in Adolescent Males.

Program Graduates (Evidence that program graduates achieve professional success) Clinical Concentration Of the 23 graduates in the last 5 years, 21 either work in the field of psychology, or have continued on to other higher education pursuits. The employment setting of graduates is varied. The highest percentage of students work in a private practice setting (35%) where they provide therapy and assessment under the supervision of a doctoral-level practitioner. Another 29% of the graduates work as service providers in a community mental health setting. Twelve percent of the graduates report working as a case coordinator and 12% report working as an adjunct instructor. The remaining 12% of students report having miscellaneous employment, such as working at a company developing assessment materials and working at a Child Ad vocacy Center. (Some graduates hold more than one job.) Eight graduates have elected to continue their education and are pursuing doctoral degrees in counseling psychology, clinical psychology, and developmental psychology, and one graduate is pursuing the Ed.S. in school psychology. Experimental Concentration Sixty-five percent (65%) of the students graduating during the period of 2001 to 2006 entered Ph.D. programs or other graduate programs at to p-level universities. These programs covered a broad spectrum of topical areas in psychology including Clinical, Social, Developmental, Cognitive, Experimental, Neuroscience, and Sport Psychology, as well as other areas related to psychology including Biostatistics, Gerontology, an d Vision Science. A partial list of students pursuing further graduate study includes, Melissa Mathews who is a Ph.D. candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at the University of Massachusetts; Marci Sammons who is a Ph.D. candidate in Brain and Cognitive Science at Miami University of Ohio; Bridget Trame Fredstrom who is a Ph.D. candidate in Human Development, University of Maryland at College Park; Allison Dyrlund who is a Ph.D. candidate in Sport Ps ychology at Florida State University, and Courtney Ortz who is a Ph.D. candidate in Gerontology at the University of Kentucky. The students who did not enter Ph.D. or other graduate programs ar e successfully employed in a variety of fields. Some obtained positions as rese arch analysts or laboratory technicians. For example, Shane Raines is a Biostatistician for Astrazeneca Pharmaceuticals, Rachel Woford is a Research Analyst in the Developmental Neurop sychology Laboratory at the University of Louisville, and Eric Vukmanic is a Laboratory Technician in the Department of Anatomical Science and Neurobiology at the University of Louisville. Still others gained employment in fields such as education, medicine, or business. For example, Donna Gregory is Coordinator of Assessment and Planning for Student Affairs and Campus Services at Western Kentucky University, Marc Fields obtained a degree in ph ysical therapy and is currently employed as a physical therapist, and Angela Weisser is in a management position in the hotel and restaurant industry in Louisville. Industrial/Organizational Concentration Virtually all of the I/O graduates are able to find employment within the discipline within 6 months of graduation. Graduates have job titles including manager of organization development, senior consultant, HR consultant, personnel examinations analyst, HR trainer, staffing specialist, CEO, rewards analyst/compensation, STAR an d guest satisfaction analyst; human resources analyst, internal policy analyst, market values su rvey analyst, survey rese arch YUM global, survey statistician, process consultant, client services coordinator, research an alyst, and assessment and development specialist. During the period under study, we have graduates working in organizations in at least 11 different states; employers of recent I/O graduates include: 92Government agencies such as The US Census Bureau, Louisville, KY and Washington, DC; The Pentagon, Washington, DC; State of Tenness ee, Department of Personnel, Nashville, TN; Louisville Metro Civil Service, Louisville, KY; Recruiting and Training Branch Division of Human Resource Management, Commonwealth of KY, Frankfort, KY; Personnel Board of Jefferson County, Birm ingham, AL; consulting firms such as Mercer Human Resources Consulting, Louisville, KY; Humana, Louisville, KY; Asurion, Nashville, TN; and private employers such as Advance Auto Parts, Roanoke, VA; Inova Health Systems, Falls Church, VA; ORC Macro, International, Calverton, MD; YUM!, Louisville, iPay Technologies, Elizabethtown, Fruit LLC, Guthrie, KY; Union Planters Bank, Cordova, TN; Gaylord Entertainment, Nashville, TN; Goodwill Industries of Middle Te nnessee, Nashville, TN; Staffmark Staffing Solutions, Nashville, TN; Remington White River Health Systems, Batesville, AR; Henderickson Trailer Suspension, Canton, OH; The Ambassador Personnel, Goldsboro, NC; Carlton Fields, P.A., Tampa, FL, Conseco Services, LLC, Carmel, IN. Although the I/O program is a \"terminal\" masters program, about 10% of the graduates successfully continue their studie s in doctoral programs. During the time period under study, graduates of the I/O concentration earned doctor ates from Bowling Green State University and New Mexico State University. There are curr ently have five program graduates who are completing doctorates at Bowling Green State University, Auburn University, University of Oklahoma, and Wright State University (2). 4. Indicators of Student Engagement a. QEP Learning Outcome 1 Clinical Concentration Graduate students in the clinical psycholo gy M.A. concentration will demonstrate their capacity to apply their knowledge and training to recognize and respond to problems via a psychometric approach. This learning outcome ad dresses the social problem of individuals in society in need of psychological assessment. The student engagement activity involves providing the needed assessments which involves the application of the following knowledge and skills: Ability to administer, score, and interpret psychological tests, including intelligence and personality measures Ability to conduct a clinical interview Ability to synthesize information into a coherent report Ability to communicate the information from a report to the client or other source To assess this QEP learning outcome, students will be evaluated on a 1 to 7 scale on their assessment skills at their internship site. In addition, a similar evaluation will be completed on assessments students conduct through the WKU Psychology Training Clinic. The supervisors' ratings will be averaged for each student. On aver age, students will receive a final evaluation of at least a 5 on the 7-point scale for their overall assessment ability. No individual student will be rated less than 4 on the 7-point scale. As a seco nd means of assessment, 25% of the initial reports (before supervisor feedback) students write will be scored by the supervisor using a rubric developed for this purpose. The average score will be no less than 70% of the possible points, and on no individual rubric category will the average be less than 60% of the possible points. No assessment results are available; this assessment is scheduled to begin during the 2006-07 academic year. 93Experimental Concentration Students will demonstrate their capacity to appl y knowledge and training to address relevant concerns in community or society. Within the Psychology M.A. experimental concentration, this outcome is interpreted to mean that students can apply the knowledge gained from their training to complete a basic or applied research project that conforms to recognized ethical principles and contributes to the understanding of behavior. The first means of assessment involves evidence of ethical conduct of research. All students will pres ent their proposed thesis research to the WKU Human Subjects Review Board or the Institu tional Animal Care and Use Committee and will provide documentation that this research has been reviewed and approved by the relevant committee. The second means of assessment involves evidence of research quality. Theses submitted by students completing the program will be scored by the students' thesis committee members according to a standard scoring rubric that addresses the quality an d appropriateness of: (1) the literature review and rationale for the research, (2) the design and methodology, (3) the method(s) of analysis and description of the results, (4) the interpretation and discussion of the results, and (5) the overall quality of the writing. At least 80% of the thesis projects will receive a \"good\" or \"excellent\" on each rating dimension by all committee members and no dimension will be rated below \"good\" by any committee member. The third means of assessment involves evidence of students' ability to communicate research findings to the scientific community. At least 50% of students completing the program will author or co-author a journal article (that is accepted for publication) or professional conference presenta tion or poster (that is accepted for presentation) before completing the program. No assessment results are available; this assessment is scheduled to begin during the 2006-07 academic year. Industrial/Organizational Concentration Students will demonstrate their capacity to appl y knowledge and training to address relevant concerns in the community or society. The dy namic nature of today's workplace results in a continuing need for organizations to train incumbents as well as new hires. Students in the Industrial/Organizational Psychology program wi ll demonstrate their capability to apply the theory and technology of training needs assessment, training design, and/or training evaluation through participation in an applied training project for an organization in our community. The host organization will benefit by identifying training needs, the design and development of relevant training modules, and/or data relevant to the effectiveness of extant training. These work products will assist the organization in meeting requ irements for productivity, OSHA, EEOC, ISO Certification, etc. Targeted competencies in clude: Technical writing skills; Oral presentation skills; Data management, analysis, and interpretation skills; and Organizational skills. As the first means of assessment, students will be required to wr ite a proposal and final report, both of which will be written in the form of a technical report. The final report will include an analysis of the effectiveness of the project. Thes e reports will also serve as a pr oduct students may add to their portfolio for applying for internships and jobs. The technical reports will be evaluated with a scoring rubric; each student will be expected to score at least at the 80% level on the scoring rubric. As the second means of assessment, student s will be required to make an oral presentation to the host organization, the effectiveness of whic h will be evaluated by the project sponsor in the host organization in terms of whether or not the project met the organization's needs. Each student will be expected to receive a passing score on the oral presentation. Studen ts collect, analyze, and interpret data as part of the project. As a third means of assessment, students must create data sets, clean the data, and appropriately analyze and interpret the data. The quality of these activities is evaluated as a component of the scoring rubric identified as part of the first means of assessment. Finally, working in the \"real world\" teaches th e students the logistics of data collection and interaction with busy managers and workers. They are introduced to office politics and the realities of implementing techniques they have learned in the classroom. They develop interpersonal and team skills via working on a project team. Each team member will evaluate 94his/her other team members on a standardized peer appraisal format. Each student will be expected to receive a passing score on the peer evaluation. No assessment results are available; this assessment is scheduled to begin during the 2006-07 academic year. b. QEP Learning Outcomes 2 and 3 The Department of Psychology Action Plan calls for assessment plans to be developed for the second and third QEP learning outcomes during the 2006-07 and 2007-08 academic years, respectively. c. Other Indicators of Student Engagement Expectations for graduate students in the psychology M.A. program ensure that all students are actively engaged in the discipline. Most students begin working on research and applied projects under faculty supervision during their fi rst semester in the program. These experiences provide valuable independent learning opportunities for students and opportunities for them to acquire research skills including skills related to participant recruitment, research methodology and data collection, data entry and analysis, in terpretation of results, and writing and presenting results. Students in the experiment al and I/O concentrations particip ate in a weekly pro-seminar in which they present research propo sals and results. Students in the clinical concentration have frequent opportunities to engage the practice of therapy and assessment skills working under supervision in the Department's training clinic. All of these activities engage students with communities other than their own (e.g., resear ch professionals, practitioners, clients, and community agencies and businesses) and provide purposeful learning opportunities that enhance their potential to contribute to community and society. The list of faculty publications presented above identified (with double asterisks) 82 graduate student co-authors. During the period covered by this review, there were also at least 125 graduate student co-authors with faculty on professional conference presentations, with most of those being at major national/international meetings. C. Other Indicators of Progr am Achievement and Contribution (Information reflecting specific ways in which the program contributes significantly to the mission and success of the university) 1. Program Viability: (Evidence that the program attracts, recruits, and retains high quality students, and evidence concerning enrollment trends in psychology.) Evidence that the program attracts and recruits high quality students can be seen in the GRE, GPA, and GAP score data presented above in Tables 33, 34, and 35. As already noted, the mean scores of psychology M.A. students on those variables are considerably higher than the corresponding CEBS and University means. The American Psychological Association (APA) conducted an employment survey in 2002 of individuals with a master's or specialist's (or related) degree in psychology (http://research.apa.org/mes2002contents.html#emp stat). Sixty-seven percent of the survey respondents reported they were employed, and 21% reported they were enrolled for further graduate study. Eighty-six percent of those who were employed were employed full-time. Most of those (78%) pursuing further graduate study were enrolled in doctoral programs. Only 9% of the respondents were unemployed and seeking work. According to the APA survey, the principal employ ers of master's-level psychologists employed full-time were schools (25%), businesses (19%), human services organizations (19%), hospitals and clinics (19%), and universities and colleges (13%). About 60% of respondents reported being employed in a capacity closely related to their grad uate training. The job market for master's-level 95psychologists was perceived to be good or excellent by 42% of the survey respondents while another 36% perceived the job market to be fair. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, \"Employment of psychologists is expected to grow faster than av erage for all occupations through 2014, because of increased demand for psychological services in sch ools, hospitals, social service agencies, mental health centers, substance abuse treatment clinics, consulting firms, and private companies.\" Because of the limited number of positions that require on ly a master's degree, however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that, except for industrial and or ganizational psychology, there will be considerable competition for jobs by master's degree holders although they may \"find jobs as psychological assistants or counselors, providing mental health services under the direct supervision of a licensed psychologist. Still others may find jobs involving research and data collection and analysis in universities, government, or private companies.\" It shou ld be noted in this context that Kentucky is one of only three states in which master's-level clinical psychologists can be licensed to practice independently. Thus, job prospects in Kentucky are likely to be better than in the nation as a whole. 2. Contributions to other University Programs: N/A 3. Use of Technology: (See description above in the U ndergraduate Program Section, Program Reference Code 760.) 4. Uniqueness of Program Western's psychology M.A. program is the largest such program in Kentucky. The program trains and graduates more master-level psychologists than any of the other regional comprehensive universities. It is the only master's-level program in th e Kentucky that offers c oncentrations in clinical, experimental, industrial/organizational, and general psychology. 5. Contributions to Diversity Goals (Program efforts and progress toward promoting diversity of students and faculty, and ways in which issues of diversity, including contributions of women and minorities, are integrated into the curriculum.) : Faculty contributions to diversity goals were described in the corresponding section above for the undergraduate program (Program Reference Code 760 ). Specific courses in the M.A. program in which issues of diversity are addressed include PSY 520 Individual Differences and Human Diversity, PSY 521 Advanced Child Psychology, PSY 541 Professional Issues and Ethics in Psychology, PSY 550 Personality Theory, PSY 551 Social Psychology of Organizations, PSY 552 Advanced Social Psychology, PSY 571 Personnel Psychology, PSY 572 Organizational Psychology, PSY 670 Equal Employment Opportunity, the Law, and Ethical Considerations. 6. Accreditation Status The American Psychological Association accredits doctoral programs in psychology, but does not accredit psychology master's degree programs. The Master's in Psychology Accreditation Council (MPAC) does accredit psychology master's degree pr ograms, but the number of accredited programs is very small (17). Moreover, MPAC has sought, an d been denied, accreditation by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. MPAC accreditation is based largely in the master's-level training standards of the Council of Applied Master's Programs in Psychology (CAMPP) and, for industrial/organizational psychology, the master's-level training standards of th e Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP). For industrial and organizational psychology, CAMPP adopted the SIOP training standards. Western's M.A. program holds membership in CAMPP. That membership requires CAMPP acknowle dgement that the program's training standards are in compliance with CAMPP standards. 967. Planning, Development, and Other Areas: N/A 8. Additional Indicators for Career Preparation Programs: N/A D. Factors Inhibiting Program Achievement and Contribution (Factors that have prevented the program from achieving Ac tion Plan goals and objectives or other achievements) The program has been quite successful at achiev ing action plan goals and objectives. However, although the program has generally been able to provide graduate assistantship support to nearly all students, the funds available for assistantships are usually not fully identified at the time admissions decisions are made and offers are ex tended to applicants. Consequently, the program is always at risk of loosing some well-qualified applicants because an assistantship offer cannot be extended at the time the applicant is accepted. Another challenge has to do with program administration. Each M.A. concentration has a coordinator who receives a one course per year reassignment to pr ogram administration. However, the administrative demands have increased considerably in recent years in response to the demands of assessment of learning outcomes and increased reporting requirements. Moreov er, some of the administrative responsibilities arise in the summer which is pr oblematic because the coordinators are onl y on 9 month faculty appointments. In addition to the course release, the administrative responsibilities of the coordinators should be compensated with a stipend or professional development funds. E. Response to Previous Progr am Reviews or Other Assessments In response to the previous program review, th e Academic Program Revi ew Committee expressed concerns about the program's reliance on part-time f aculty, and a decrease in pr ogram enrollment from 46 in 1996 to 40 in 1999. During the period covered by the present review, the vast majority of program courses were taught by regular full-time faculty. The very few part-time facu lty members who taught cour ses in the M.A. program were highly qualified, and in most cases were on optional retirement, or held faculty rank in the Department although their primary appointment was to another unit. For example, Dr. Richard Greer, Professor of Psychology and Director of the Counseling and Testing Center, regularly taught PSY 641 Theories of Psychotherapy, and PSY 642 Clinical Interviewing and Psychotherapy. Dr. Cathy Reeves, a local clinical psychology practitioner, taught PSY 541 Professional Issues and Ethics in Psychology. The teaching of both of these part-time faculty members was informed by thei r personal clinical experience and expertise and was an asset to the program. Likewise, fo r the past several years PS Y 505 Statistical Software for Behavioral Sciences has been taught by Dr. Scott Shadrick. Dr. Shadrick holds a research position with the Army Research Institute in Ft. Knox. In addition, he took this course as part of his M.A. program of study at Western, and has a very strong background in statistics. Due to his extensive experience working with SPSS software in his professional position, Dr. Shadrick is especially we ll-qualified to teach PSY 505. Since the previous program review, program enrollmen t has increased and is stable. Moreover, for the past several years the program has been essentially operating at full capacity. F. Future Directions (Briefly discuss plans or future di rections for the program that have been developed by the faculty and administ rators of the program. Are the plans documented in the University 's Strategic Planning Process? Where is the program headed? What are its most pressing needs? What are its opportunities for enhancement and/or improvement? What resources (in ge neral) are needed to realize plans?) There are no plans at this time to make changes to the program. 97Graduate Program Section Program: Psychology Ed.S. Reference Code: 147 I.

School Psychology program has been fairly constant across years. This is a 3-year, 75 credit-hour program that requires a thesis and a year long internship. The number of students enrolled will vary somewhat across years as a function of when students complete the thesis and internship. The program typically admitted 9-10 students per year, and as Table 41 below shows, graduated an average of 8.8 students per year, resulting in an average yearly enrollment of about 28 students. B.

Students are admitted as a cohort to start classes in the fall semester each year. The numbe r of students admitted and the number that graduated from each of three successive cohorts admitted since fall 2001 is shown in Table 42. Of the 4 students that enrolled but did not graduate from the school psychology program, only one dropped out for unknown reasons. Two students switched to WKU's graduate program in special education and are currently special education t eachers in the state of It should be noted that of the 10 students admitted in the 2004 cohort, all 10 are completing their internships and are expected to graduate in 2007. C. Comparisons with External Data Table 43: Program Enrollments at Kentucky Public Universities WKU EKU (CPE). 98Western Kentucky University, Eastern Kentucky University, and the University of Kentucky have the only school psychology programs in Kentucky. It is unclear why there are no CPE data for UK Personal correspondence w ith UK's school psychology pr ogram director indicated they typically accept 10 students in the Specialist program each year and average about 9 graduates per year. UK has the only doctoral school psychology program the state; some of their Specialist-level graduates continue on into the doctoral program rather than go to the public schools to work as school psychologists. The three school psychology programs in the state are comparable in size. As noted in Table 43, Western' s enrollment averaged 28 students per year from 2001 through 2005. Based on the data in Table 43, Eastern's enrollment was slightly less, but we question the accuracy of the enrollment data for Eastern for 2005. Table 44: Degrees Conferred by Ke ntucky Public Education (CPE). During the period covered by this review, the number of students obtaining a specialist degree in school psychology was 44 at Western and 42 at Eastern. The University of Kentucky program director estimated the number of graduates from their program during this period to be about 45. D. Table 45: GRE Scores of Stude nts Admitted to the Program Avg.

The maximum score is 1600. During the period covered by this review, the mean GRE score of students admitted to the school psychology program was consistently higher than th e CEBS and University means. Moreover, the 5-year average of school psychology students was more than a standard deviation above the 5-year CEBS average, and was approximately a standard deviation higher th an the 5-year University average. These data are indicative of the relative high quality of the students admitted to the school psychology program. Table 46: Undergraduate GPAs of Students Admitted to the Program Avg. Ugrad GPA Fall 2001 Fall 2002 Fall 2003 Fall 2004 Fall 2005 Mean Psychology Ed.S. 3.44 3.53 3.65 3.64 Table 46 shows that for 2001 through 2005, the m ean undergraduate GPA of st udents admitted to the school psychology program was consistently higher than the corresponding CEBS and University means. The 5-year average of school psychology students was more than three-tenths of a point higher than the corresponding CEBS and Univ ersity 5-year averages. These data are indicative of the relative high quality of the students admitted to the school psychology program. 99Table 47: GAP Scores of Students Admitted to the Program Average GAP* Fall 2001 Fall 2002 Fall 2003 Fall 2004 Fall 2005 Mean Psychology as (Verba l GRE score + Quantitative GRE score) * Undergraduate GPA. The maximum score is 6400. Table 47 shows that for 2001 through 2005, the mean GAP scores of students admitted to the school psychology program was consistently higher than the corresponding CEBS and University means. Moreover, the 5-year average of school psychology students was more than 600 points higher than the corresponding CEBS and Univ ersity 5-year averages. These data are indicative of the relative high quality of the students admitted to the school psychology program. E. Table 48: Graduate GPAs of Program Graduates 3.72 The mean GPA of school psychology program graduates is high and essentially the same as the CEBS and University means. Given the competitive process an d selection criteria used for admission to the school psychology program, it is not surprising that program graduates have high GPAs. II. Program Description and Self Study A. Mission Statement/Relation of Program to University Mission The primary goal of the WKU School Psychology Pr ogram is to train student s who are competent to provide both direct and indirect psychological services to students, educators, parents, and community members in a variety of educational settings, using a problem-solving framework. The program strives to prepare a professional who can gather appropriate inform ation, analyze the situatio n, consider intervention approaches to resolving difficulties or improving the situation, act upon the best alternative, and then evaluate the outcomes of those actions in relation to problem-solving goals. School psychologists must be sensitive to a diversity of values, interactional styles, and cultural expectations, and must develop skills in dealing with diverse language and cultural issues. Professional growth and continuing education are a lifelong quest. Students are introduced to the philosophy that their formal training is but a beginning; continued professional competence requires continued initiative. Consistent with WKU's mission and QEP goals, the school psychology program's goal is to prepare students to be competent and productive leaders th at enhance the quality of life for others. School psychologists are trained to assist in improving the education and socialization of students in school settings. As such, they apply their k nowledge and training to address relevant concerns in our educational system. Public school students are becoming increasingly diverse. The school psychology program recognizes the importance of training school psychologists to understand culture and ethnicity factors in their applied practice. 100B. Teaching and Learning 1.

Description of Students Since 2001, 54 students have been, or curren tly are, enrolled in the school psychology graduate program. The vast majority of those students (n = 50, 92.6%) have been or are full time students. National statistics retrieved from the National Association of School Psychologists website* indicate that almost 93% of school psychologists are Caucasian and that more than 80% of school psychology graduate students are female. WKU's school psychology program reflects the national trends with 87% of our students being Caucasian and 91% of our students being female. The majority of our students (estimated at 79%) attended our graduate program directly after graduating with their Bachelo r's degrees. Job experiences of our applicants have largely been in the human services field with roles such as be havioral therapists, direct care workers in youth residential facilities, education coordinator at a He ad Start program, and special education teacher. Three have entered our program already possessing Master's degrees in clinical or counseling psychology. Of those, one worked in a facility for the elderly, one worked in a juvenile detention center, and one was adjunct faculty for a University. *Source: http://www.nasponline.org/resources/culturalcompetence/minority_demog.aspx As might be expected, the majority of WKU school psychology students come from colleges and universities within Kentucky with the larg est percentage of students come from Western Kentucky University (46.3%). However, the program recruits nationally, and 29.6% of the students during the period covered by this review were from states other than Kentucky. c. Information about Graduate Assistantships From fall 2001 through fall 2005, graduate assistantships were offered to 43 of the 46 students admitted into the school psychology Ed.S. program. The vast majority of those students continued on an assistantship for their seco nd year in the program. The Office of Graduate Studies provided 101funding each year for a total of 18 graduate assi stantships in the Department of Psychology to support students in both the M.A. and Ed.S. gradua te programs. That office also provided funding each year through the Minority A ssistantship Program for an additio nal 2-3 assistantships. Almost all of the remaining assistantships were funded by faculty grants and internally by the Department of Psychology from grant salary savings and lapse salary. The Department uses a priority system for a ssigning graduate assistant duties with the top priorities being a.) the assignment of two students in the clinical M.A. concentration to the University Counseling and Testing Center, b.) the assignment of students to assist faculty with labor intensive courses such as the large auditorium sections of PSY 100 and PSY 560 Assessment of Cognitive and Intellectual Functioning, and c.) staffing for the Educational Technology Center. The second priority is the assignment of students to individual faculty to provide assistance with teaching (typically grading, reco rding grades, finding or developi ng resources, etc.), research (recruiting and running participants, data entry, data analysis, writing research reports), and service (University committees, working with local agencies and businesses, data entry and analysis, writing technical reports, etc.). Usually, several students are assigned each year to units outside the Department. These have included Ea rly Childhood Education, the Literacy Clinic, FaCET, Human Resources, The Office of Interna tional Programs, and the Leadership Studies Center. The graduate assistantship assignments employed by the Department of Psychology provide valuable learning opportunities for school psychology students as well as opportunities for them to become engaged with communities other than their own. For example, school psychology students have worked in the Parker-Bennett-Curry elementa ry school assisting teachers with high risk students. Many of the graduate assistants work with faculty on research projects, which is an integral part of the scientist/practitioner mode l of psychology graduate training programs. 2. Indicators of Teaching and Advising Quality As indicated in Section III.F. of the Department Section, four Department faculty members received the CEBS Faculty Award fo r Teaching during the period cove red by this review, one received the University Faculty Award for Teaching, and one received the KYVU Award for Online Teaching. Most of those faculty members provide teaching s upport to this program. Two faculty members who support this program serve on the FaCET Advisory Board, and program faculty regularly participate in FaCET workshops. Most program courses are taught by faculty members who have active and productive research programs related to the conten t of those courses. This faculty scholarship combined with a high rate of attendance at prof essional conferences help s to ensure faculty are knowledgeable about current trends and research in their specialty areas. 3. Indicators of St udent Learning a. Assessment of Currently Enrolled Students During the 2002-2003 academic year, the Department developed explicit student learning outcomes and associated assessment plans for the Ed.S. program. Presented here are the 2005-06 learning outcomes, assessment plans, and assessm ent results, all of which are representative of those since 2002-03. Learning Outcome 1: Basic Knowledge of the Discipline . Students will demonstrate basic knowledge of the profession of school psychology, specifically: diagnosis and fact finding, prevention and intervention, applied psychological foundations, applied educational foundations, and ethical and legal considerations. Assessment Plan . At least 95% of the program graduates will pass the School Psychology Praxis exam at the state certification level. Sub- scales on the Praxis exam specifically measure 102diagnosis and fact finding, prevention and intervention, applied psychological foundations, applied educational foundations, and ethi cal and legal considerations. Assessment Results . 100% of the program graduates (8/8) passed the School Psychology Praxis exam on their first attempt. The students tended to score low on the Applied Educational Foundations section of the exam. A proposal to revise the school psychology program is in process. A different literacy co urse is proposed and the curric ulum course will be dropped. Learning Outcome 2: Research and Writing Skills, and Independent Learning . Students will demonstrate proficiencies in research skills, writing skills, and the capacity for independent learning. Assessment Plan . (a) Specialist (thesis) projects submitted by students completing the program will be scored by the students' thesis co mmittees according to a standard scoring rubric that will address the appropriateness of (1) the cont ent of the literature review, (2) research design and methodology used, (3) description and analysis of results, and (4) the overall quality of the writing. At least 80% of the thesis projects w ill be rated by each committee member as good or excellent on each rating dimension. (b) On the follow up survey of program graduates, at least 70% of those who respond to the survey will rate thei r training on a four-point scale as good (3) or excellent (4) in knowledge of research, statistics, and evaluation methods; ability to evaluate research and translate research into practice; and ability to plan and conduct investigations and program evaluations for improvement of services. Assessment Results . (a) 100% of the ratings for the thesis projects were ratings of good or excellent on each rating dimension. (b) Only 3 of the 8 graduates responded to the survey. Of those 3, 100% responded \"good\" or \"excellent\" to the questions on (a) knowledge of research, statistics, and evaluation methods, and (b) ability to evaluate research and translate research into practice. Two-thirds of the respondents responded \"good\" or \"excellent\" to the question on the ability to plan and conduct investigations and program evaluations for improvement of services. The other \"third\" responded to that item as \"fair. \" These results do not indicate a need for program changes at this time. Learning Outcome 3: Employment . Students completing the program will be successful in obtaining employment as a school psychologist. Assessment Plan . Of those students who complete the program, at least 80% of those who seek employment as a school psychologist will obt ain an appropriate position within one year of program completion. Assessment Results . 100% of the graduates obtained employment as a school psychologist. These results do not indicate a need for program changes at this time. b. Other Indicators of Success (Evidence of student achievement and success, such as special experiences/projects, honors, publications, presentations, internship placements, number of students in thesis versus non-thesis options and thesis titles) Student Awards . During the period covered by this review, a number of school psychology students and program graduates were recognized with various awards. For example, the Kentucky Association for Psychology in the Schools annually gives out an award called the Jennie Ewald Outstanding Graduate Student award. School psychology graduate students from the three school psychology graduate programs in Kentucky (WKU, UK, EKU) compete for the award and only one student is selected. For the last 4 consecu tive years, a WKU graduate student has won the award. Some of the individual reward recipi ents and their awards are identified below. John Lamana, Jennie Ewald Memorial Scholarship Award for Outstanding School Psychology Graduate Student, Kentucky Association for Psychology in the Schools, October, 2005 Amanda(Tyson) Crick (Ed.S., 2002), Region 1 Best Practices Award, Kentucky Association for Psychology in the Schools, October, 2005 103 David Taylor (Ed.S., 1995), Region 2 Best Practices Award, Kentucky Association for Psychology in the Schools, October, 2005 Rachael Sloan, Outstanding Graduate Student Award from Kentucky Association for Psychology in the Schools, 2004 Praxis Pass Rate . A primary example of student academic achievement is the 100% pass rate on the national school psychology Praxis exam (o ver the past 12 years). This is especially impressive given that outside of Kentucky, the test is usually taken by students near the end of their third year of training. Due to provisiona l certification requirements for internships in Kentucky, WKU students typically take the exam in January of their second year (after just 3 semesters of coursework). Students are actively involved in research and pr ofessional activities. Of the students admitted since 2001, 17 (31.5%) have presented at state or national conferences with 5 of those students presenting at two conferences. Two students are co-authors on publications with 6 additional students potential co-authors on publications. All school psychology graduate students are required to complete an internship (minimum of 1200 clock hours) and all have been placed in school settings within Kentucky and in other states. All students must complete a thesis as part of program requirements. Titles of the 42 theses completed by school psychology graduates since 2001 are listed below. 2001 Test-Retest Reliability of Phonemic Awarene ss Assessment Instruments on Kindergarten Students The Relationship Between Social and Emotional Intelligence in Children Improving Head Start Children's Emergent Literacy and Phonemic Awareness Through Parent Training Phonemic Awareness in Preschool Children in Relation to Reading Practices in the Home Examining Children's IEP Knowledge and Pref erences in the Special Education Process Emotional Intelligence in Adolescents: How it Relates to Giftedness 2002 The Effect of Cognitive Load on Illusory Correlation Lucky Pennies and Four Leaf Clovers: Young Children's Understanding of Superstitions Test-Retest Reliability of the Universal Nonverbal Intelligence Test with Children Diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder The Incorporation of Emergent Lite racy in Head Start Classrooms Training Practices in School Consultation: Twenty Years Later Reading Mastery Versus Word Study Instruction as it Pertains to Third Graders' Reading Achievement Scores The Effectiveness of Listening Previe wing on Oral Reading Performance Children's Understanding of Racial Classifica tions as a Function of their Knowledge of Inheritance Behaviorally Disruptive Children's Reasoning about the Emotional Consequences of Victimization Social Intelligence: Social Skills Competence and Emotional Intelligence in Gifted Adolescents Emotional Intelligence, Soci al Competence and Success in High School Students Three Factors that Contribute to College Stud ents' Acceptance and Tolerance of Diversity: Religiosity, Moral Reasoning, and Attributional Complexity Consultation Trends in the School Psychology Literature 1042003 Consultation Trends in School Psychology Review over the Last Twenty-Two Years Predictive Validity of Kindergarten Phone mic Awareness Measures on Second Grade Reading Skills Content Validation and Modification of the AAUW Survey on Sexual Harassment in the Schools for Use with Juvenile Sexual Offenders Young Children's Understanding of Superstitions Examining Emotional Intelligence and Social Skills in a Residential Deaf Population Effects of Perceived Costs and Rewards on Motiv ation and Retention of Rape Crisis Center Volunteers The Effects of Instruction and Strategy Implementation on Increasing Mathematics Computation Skills for Students with Learning Problems: A Meta-Analysis Emotional Intelligence in Children: A Review of Programs and Web Sites 2004 Assessing Job Satisfaction and Emotional Intelligence in Public School Teachers Emotional Intelligence in Children with Atte ntion Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) Using Social Stories to Teach Social and Beha vioral Skills to Preschool Children with Autism The Use of Social Stories to Teach Social an d Behavioral Skills to Preschool Children with Moderate to Severe Autism School Psychology Practitioners' Perspectives on Consultation Training and Practice Investigating Emotional Intelligence and Social Skills in Home Schooled Students Concurrent Validity Study of the Clinical Assessment of Depression with the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale Concurrent Validity Study of the Clinical Assessment of Depression with the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition 2005 Juvenile Delinquency Prevention through the ALIVE Center (A Local Information and Volunteer Exchange) Emotional Intelligence and Social Skills: Studying Students with Emotional-Behavioral Disability (EBD) A Comparison of the BASC and CBCL with At-Risk Preschoolers A Comparison of the BASC and CBCL with Referred Preschoolers Concurrent Validity of the Clinical Assessmen t of Depression with the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition More than Meets the Eye: The Covert Nature of Female Aggression in a Kindergarten through Second Grade Population c. Program Graduates (Evidence that program graduates achieve professional success) All program graduates have become employed in public school systems. Counting graduates before and since 2001, our program's graduates have become involved in the Kentucky Association for Psychology in the Schools' (K APS) Executive Council in the positions of President, Treasurer, Ne wsletter editor, and Regional Representatives. Graduates of our program annually receive recognition at th e KAPS Fall conference award ce remony for best practices and have twice been recognized as the School Psyc hologist of the Year in the past decade. All graduates since 2001 have remained successf ul school psychology practitioners. A few have 105furthered their education. In the past decade, tw o have gone on to receive doctoral degrees and three have taken additional coursework to obtain certification as special education directors. 4. Indicators of Student Engagement a. QEP Learning Outcome 1 Graduate students in the school psychology Ed .S. program will demonstrate their capacity to apply knowledge and training to address relevant concerns in community or society by working with students in the community and school systems exhibiting learning and/or behavioral difficulties. This will involve the application of students' knowledge and skills as follows: demonstration of basic assessment approaches demonstration of basic assessment methods demonstration of ability to develop interventions and decisions based on data evaluates the effectiveness of interventions/decisions. demonstration of the ability to design and implement appropriate data collection techniques. demonstration of problem-solving strategies that employ data based decision making in all aspects of service delivery. As the first means of assessment, students will be evaluated on their degree of competency/skill development on each of the relevant knowledge , skills, and/or behaviors listed above on a 0 to 3 point scale by th eir internship supervisors at the middle and end of the students' internships. Students need to receive a score of 2 (established) or 3 (integrated) on each item by the end of their internship. Students will also be evaluated on their level of professional development on each of the relevant knowledge, skills, and/or behaviors listed above on a 0 to 4 point scale by their internship supervisors at th e middle and end of the their internships. Students need to receive as score of 3 (satisfactory) or 4 (area of strength) on each item by the end of their internship. As a second means of assessment, near the end of their internship, students will submit a portfolio of experiences, activities, and products (e.g., assessment and intervention reports) to the faculty internship superv isor. Students must receive a passing grade on the parts of the portfolio related to each of the relevant knowledge, skills , and/or behaviors listed above. (Activities/items in the portfolios are evaluated on a pass/fail basis.) b. QEP Learning Outcomes 2 and 3 The Department of Psychology Action Plan calls for assessment plans to be developed for the second and third QEP learning outcomes during the 2006-07 and 2007-08 academic years, respectively. c. Other Indicators of Student Engagement Expectations for graduate students in the psychology Ed.S. program ensure that all students are actively engaged in the discipline. Most students begin working on research and applied projects under faculty supervision during their fi rst semester in the program. These experiences provide valuable independent learning opportunities for students and opportunities for them to acquire research skills including skills related to participant recruitment, research methodology and data collection, data entry and analysis, in terpretation of results, and writing and presenting results. These activities engage students with communities other than their own (e.g., research professionals, practitioners, clients, and comm unity agencies and businesses) and provide purposeful learning opportunities that enhance their potential to contribute to community and society. 106C. Other Indicators of Progr am Achievement and Contribution (Information reflecting specific ways in which the program contributes significantly to the mission and success of the university ) 1. Program Viability (Evidence that the program attracts, recruits, and retains quality students, and evidence about enrollm ent trends in school psychology.) Evidence that the program attracts and recruits high quality students can be seen in the GRE, GPA, and GAP score data presented in Tables 45, 46, and 47. As already noted, the mean scores of psychology Ed.S. students on those variables are considerably higher than the corresponding CEBS and University means. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau Labor Statistics web site, \"employment opportunities for psychologists are expected to grow faster than the average for all occupations through 2014 because of increased demand for psychological se rvices in schools . . . . Among the specialties in this field, school psychologists - especially those with a specialist degree of higher - may enjoy the best job opportunities. Growing awareness of how st udents' mental health and behavioral problems, such as bullying, affect learning is increasing demand for school psychologists to offer student counseling and mental health services.\" (S ource: https://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos056.htm). 2. Contributions to University Programs: N/A 3. Use of Technology (See description above in the Undergraduate Program Section, Program Reference Code 760) 4. Uniqueness of Program Western's Ed.S. school psychology program is one of only three such programs in Kentucky. 5. Contributions to Diversity Goals (Program efforts and progress toward promoting diversity of students and faculty, and ways in which issues of diversity, including contributions of women and minorities, are integrated into the curriculum.) Faculty contributions to diversity goals were described in the corresponding section above for the undergraduate program (Program Code 760). Specific courses in the school psychology program in which issues of diversity are addressed include PSY 521 Advanced Child Psychology, PSY 541 Professional Issues and Ethics in Psychology, PSY 561 Advanced Assessment in Educational Settings, PSY 643 Psychoeducational Assessment, and PSY 545 Clinical Child Psychology. 6. Accreditation Status The school psychology program is nationally accredited by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education and the Natio nal Association of School Psychologists. The program is currently consid ered \"Fully Approved.\" 7. Planning, Development, and Other Areas (Achievement of strategic planning goals or action plans not covered elsewhere in this document, and succ esses in attracting development funds and other forms of private support.) The school psychology program currently has an $8000 grant from the Regional Child Development Clinics (RCDC) of Bowling Green to provide behavioral intervention services to RCDC clients. 1078. Additional Indicators for Career Preparation Programs (Current and future demand or job outlook for graduates in school psychology; the 'need' for program graduates in the region, state, and nati on; job placement data for graduates; achievements and success of graduates in the specific career area; efforts of the faculty to assist students in id entifying and obtaining employment.) The demand for school psychologists is strong and, as such, all of the program graduates (easily) obtain employment in public school settings. Many employers call the school psychology faculty asking about upcoming graduates. The demand for school psychologists has been growing extensively over the past few decades with estimates of the number of practitioners tripling since 1980 (Fagan & Wise, 2000). Over the past few years, the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) has been concerned about shortages of school psychologists across the United States. Some regions of the country are reported by NA SP to face critical shortage s. Kentucky may not face a critical shortage because it has three school psychology training prog rams. But it does face a shortage. Despite three training programs, school ps ychology positions continue to go unf illed each year across the state. An article in Louisville's Courier Journal (12-5-04) noted school psychologist shortages were more likely to occur in rural regions of the state and it also reported that less than half of Kentucky's school districts had a school psychologist on staff. Furthermore, the NASP recommended ratio of school psychologists to students is 1:1000. According to a report entitled \"The State of School Psychology in Kentucky - 2005\" (available online at http://www .psychology.eku.edu/KAPS/), of the Kentucky school districts that do have school psychologists, the average ratio of school psychologists to students is 1:1781, indicating a need for additional school psychologists. The demand for school psychologists is expected to remain strong, partly because schools are increasing the number of school ps ychologists being employed and part ly because a large percentage of current school psychologists are nearing retirement age (Charvat & Feinberg, 2003; Reschly, 2000). However, Fagan and Wise (2000) reported \"the num ber of institutions offering training in school psychology appears to have stabilized throughout the 1990s\" (p. 185). The combination of a stable number of training programs and increased demand has been noticed by the popular press. In the February 18, 2002 edition of the US News and World Report , an article entitled, \"Careers to Count On,\" reported school psychology as one of \"eight of the nation's most secure career tracks.\" The May, 2006 issue of Money magazine had Psychologist as one of the 10 best jobs and noted, \"Greater awareness of how mental health and behavior issues affect learning makes school psychology a particularly fast-growing specialty\" (p. 102).

Factors Inhibiting Program Achievement and Contribution The program has been quite successful at achiev ing action plan goals and objectives. However, although the program has generally been able to provide graduate assistantship support to nearly all students, the funds available for assistantships are usually not fully identified at the time admissions decisions are made and offers are ex tended to applicants. Consequently, the program is always at risk of loosing some well-qualified applicants because an assistantship offer cannot be extended at the time the applicant is accepted. 108Another challenge has to do with program admini stration. The Ed.S. program coordinator receives a one course per year reassignment to program administration. However, the administrative demands have increased considerably in recent y ears in response to the demands of assessment of learning outcomes and increased reporting requirements. Moreover, some of the administrative responsibilities arise in the summer which is problematic because the coordinator is only on a 9-month faculty appoint ment. In addition to the course release, the administrative responsibilities of th e coordinators should be compensated with a stipend or professional development funds. Finally, National Association of School Psychologi sts (NASP) accreditation re quirements specify at least 3 FTE school psychology faculty (each with a mi nimum of two years of experience as a practitioner) for a program. Accreditation standards also require no more than 12 interns (graduate students in their third year of the program) per faculty member assigned to the internship course (PSY 592). WKU's school psychology program currently meets those requirements. However, due to the nature of the applied training, thesis requirements, and the limit of 12 inte rns, our training program cannot substantially increase in the number of graduate students (to meet the demand for school psychologists) without an additional faculty member. E. Response to Previous Progr am Reviews or Other Assessments The primary concern of previous NCATE and NASP accreditation program reviews was that the school psychology program needs to move toward an electronic system of continuous assessment of its graduate students. This would include identifying critical performances and evaluation components (e.g., assessment instruments) and having a system where the evaluation outc omes, and the entire data system, are all on-line. To address such a concern, pr ogress has been made toward identifying critical performances for specific classes and streamlining the assessment documents to allow for more \"continuous\" assessment on the same desired outcome skills. F. Future Directions: (Briefly discuss plans or future di rections for the program that have been developed by the faculty and administ rators of the program. Are the plans documented in the University 's Strategic Planning Process? Where is the program headed? What are its most pressing needs? What are its opportunities for enhancement and/or improvement? What resources (in ge neral) are needed to realize plans?) The school psychology program is currently underg oing revisions to meet new accreditation standards and to remain competitive within the state. To remain competitive with Kentucky's other school psychology programs, program re visions have recently been approved to decrease WKU's required number of graduate hours in the program from 75 to 71. (UK's program requires 69 hours while EKU's program requires 71). In addition to decreasing hours, a course on the assessment of reading (LTCY 520) replaced a course on reading instruction (LTCY 519) in an effort to provide more relevant training to our graduates. Additional program changes (e.g., content or coursework) may be needed to meet current recommended practices (e.g., required in a revised special education federal law passed in 2004) and new NASP accreditation standards.
