Therefore, educators and practitioners should develop their knowledge and understanding in this regard. Spiritual care helps people overcome their anxieties, worries, and suffering; reduces stress; promotes healing; and encourages patients to find inner peace. To provide comprehensive and appropriate care while upholding human/ethical virtues, the spiritual dimension must be a priority. We aim to develop spiritual care competence guidelines for Palliative Care (PC) education and practice in Portugal and Spain. The study detailed in this protocol paper will include three phases. In phase I, the phenomenon will be characterized and divided into two tasks: (1) a concept analysis of \"spiritual care competence\"; and (2) a systematic review of interventions or strategies used to integrate spiritual care in PC education and practice. Phase II will entail a sequential explanatory approach (online survey and qualitative interviews) to deepen understanding of the perceptions and experiences of educators, practitioners, and patients/family carers regarding spiritual care in PC education and practice and generate ideas for the next steps. Phase III will comprise a multi-phased, consensus-based approach to identify priority areas of need as decided by a group of experts. Results will be used to produce guidelines for integrating spirituality and spiritual care competence within PC education and practice and synthesized in a white book for PC professionals. The value of this improved examination of spiritual care competence will ultimately depend on whether it can inform the development and implementation of tailored educational and PC services. The project will promote the 'spiritual care' imperative, helping practitioners and patients/family carers in their preparedness for End-of-Life care, as well as improving curricular practices in this domain.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-02-16", "cleaned_text": "and PracticE: Mixed-Methods Research in the Development of Iberian Guidelines [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20043505](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20043505) [Spiritual Wellbeing in Palliative Care and Health /journal/ijerph/special_issues/spiritual_wellbeing_palliative_care )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-ijerph-20-03505), [2](#B2-ijerph-20-03505)]. Suffering is highly prevalent in the clinic, especially in life-threatening situations such as palliative care [ [3](#B3-ijerph-20-03505)]. The current care model is often based on the paradigm of scientific materialism, which given its epistemological limitations, is unable to understand or address this reality [ [4](#B4-ijerph-20-03505)]. In other words, clinicians do not have a model, framework, or paradigm to fully understand and attend to suffering. Physicians' failure to comprehend the holistic nature of suffering can result in medical interventions that, while technically appropriate, not only fail to relieve suffering but can cause it [ [5](#B5-ijerph-20-03505)]. [6](#B6-ijerph-20-03505), [7](#B7-ijerph-20-03505)]. Given the need to understand and attend to this human experience, especially among health professionals, attempts have been made for some years to expand the limited materialistic framework and integrate spirituality into clinical practice [ [8](#B8-ijerph-20-03505)]. [9](#B9-ijerph-20-03505)] p. 2. This term encompasses a broad understanding of spirituality, implying that a person can rely on a variety of sources of spiritual connection [ [10](#B10-ijerph-20-03505)]. Spiritual care is the integration of spirituality into the therapeutic situation with a focus on healing the whole person [ [11](#B11-ijerph-20-03505), [12](#B12-ijerph-20-03505), [13](#B13-ijerph-20-03505)]. [12](#B12-ijerph-20-03505), [14](#B14-ijerph-20-03505), [15](#B15-ijerph-20-03505)]. The integration of spiritual care standards provides practitioners with a greater understanding of their patients, enhancing their potential to inspire hope and relieve suffering [ [16](#B16-ijerph-20-03505), [17](#B17-ijerph-20-03505)]. Despite increased interest in spiritual care within health sciences education and practice [ [18](#B18-ijerph-20-03505)], it remains the least developed and most neglected dimension of care, particularly Palliative Care (PC) [ [13](#B13-ijerph-20-03505)]. [19](#B19-ijerph-20-03505), [20](#B20-ijerph-20-03505), [21](#B21-ijerph-20-03505)], including inadequate staff training [ [22](#B22-ijerph-20-03505), [23](#B23-ijerph-20-03505)], a belief that spiritual care is 'not my professional role' [ [24](#B24-ijerph-20-03505)], \"peer pressure, a perceived lack of time due to prioritization of other medical or physical concerns, confusion between spirituality and religion, and staff members' lack of comfort with, or awareness of, their own personal spirituality\" [ [10](#B10-ijerph-20-03505)] p. 262. [25](#B25-ijerph-20-03505), [26](#B26-ijerph-20-03505)]. The initiative resulted in standards of excellence for spiritual care education and led to the development of learning materials and evaluation of competencies (knowledge, skills, and attitudes) to provide spiritual care. Considering the cultural differences and spiritual beliefs across different countries, spiritual care is not transferable wholesale [ [27](#B27-ijerph-20-03505)]. This means that general principles may be transferable, but there is a need for local modifications. In addition, the evidence highlights the need for a more unified and standardized method for gaining spiritual care competencies in multidisciplinary educational and practice settings [ [27](#B27-ijerph-20-03505)]. [28](#B28-ijerph-20-03505), [29](#B29-ijerph-20-03505)]. Despite this, they are mostly aware that providing spiritual care is part of their role [ [8](#B8-ijerph-20-03505), [30](#B30-ijerph-20-03505)]. While a considerable amount of literature has been published on the role of spiritual care in PC practice, in particular about identifying spiritual needs and offering appropriate care [ [31](#B31-ijerph-20-03505), [32](#B32-ijerph-20-03505), [33](#B33-ijerph-20-03505), [34](#B34-ijerph-20-03505)], there are gaps in PC theory and practice on the importance of spiritual care competence [ [13](#B13-ijerph-20-03505)]. To circumvent or mitigate these constraints, PC education and practice should be founded on an existential-humanistic approach that promotes a holistic view of a person and human flourishing [ [35](#B35-ijerph-20-03505)]. This framework would stimulate the practitioner's awareness of how to foster individual experiences of existential or spiritual strength and improve the opportunities for personal growth, well-being, and satisfaction [ [35](#B35-ijerph-20-03505)]. [36](#B36-ijerph-20-03505)], thereby bridging the gap between theory and practice. To address this gap, the primary purpose of this project is to develop spiritual care competence recommendations for PC education and practice in Portugal and Spain. Some secondary objectives were also defined: (a) a concept analysis of the role of \"spiritual care competence\" in PC education and practice; (b) a systematic review of the interventions or strategies used to integrate spiritual care in PC education and practice; (c) a study of the perceptions and experiences of educators, practitioners, and patients/family carers regarding spiritual care competence in PC education and practice; and (d) validated guidelines for integrating spiritual care competence in PC education and practice. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Overview [37](#B37-ijerph-20-03505)]. In iterative multi-phase designs, each new step of data collecting informs the conceptualization and application of the next phase. Data triangulation is a cornerstone of mixed methods research, offering a comprehensive view [ [38](#B38-ijerph-20-03505)] that can improve the credibility of research findings. The study's stages and data-gathering procedures are intended to accomplish robust data triangulation. We will triangulate data by data source (documents and reports, different target samples) and method (literature review, survey, interview). [Figure 1](#ijerph-20-03505-f001)depicts data triangulation during the different study phases, as well as how these phases are linked. The study will begin in February 2023. The estimated completion date for the study is December 2025. [osf.io/4vxwu](http://osf.io/4vxwu)). 2.1.1. Phase I Purpose [39](#B39-ijerph-20-03505)] p. 1 are required, we will also develop a systematic review of interventions or strategies used to integrate spiritual care competence in PC education and practice (Task 2). Procedures - Task 1: Concept analysis on \"Spiritual Care Competence\" in PC. [40](#B40-ijerph-20-03505)]. A rigorous process of asking and answering analytical questions will establish a definition of the concept and determine its antecedents, attributes, boundaries, and outcomes. Electronic searches will be conducted using the databases CINAHL, Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Science Direct. The search terms ('spiritual*' OR 'religio*' OR 'existenti*') will be combined OR 'terminal care' OR 'terminally ill') with no time restrictions on published articles. To ensure relevance for PC educators and practitioners, only scholarly, peer-reviewed studies with full text in English, Spanish, and Portuguese will be included. The PRISMA Protocol checklist [ [41](#B41-ijerph-20-03505)] will be used. - Task 2: Systematic review. [41](#B41-ijerph-20-03505)]. References found in the database search will be added to Rayyan Software [ [42](#B42-ijerph-20-03505)], and duplicates and cross-references will be removed. The titles, abstracts, and keywords of the selected papers will be screened by two independent reviewers using the above-mentioned eligibility criteria. Eligible full-text manuscripts and articles with unclear inclusion based on the abstracts will be evaluated separately by the same reviewers to confirm inclusion or exclusion. Disagreements will be resolved during a consensus meeting. A third reviewer will be consulted if a consensus cannot be reached. The inclusion or removal of studies will be reported independently by two researchers using Excel spreadsheet software. [43](#B43-ijerph-20-03505)] checklists or Mixed Methods Appraisal Tools [ [44](#B44-ijerph-20-03505)]. A narrative approach will be used to undertake a qualitative synthesis of the body of research. A meta-analysis will be conducted if necessary, depending on the degree of variability across included studies. The protocol for the systematic review will be submitted to the PROSPERO registry for assessment and approval and will be described in the systematic study's final report. 2.1.2. Phase II Purpose [45](#B45-ijerph-20-03505), [46](#B46-ijerph-20-03505)], composed of two parts: first, an online survey with educators and practitioners in PC (Task 3); second, an in-depth qualitative study with patients and families and a Focus Group Discussion with educators and practitioners in PC (Task 4). Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected sequentially [ [35](#B35-ijerph-20-03505)]. Using merging procedures, participant narratives will provide a more thorough understanding of the statistical findings [ [47](#B47-ijerph-20-03505)]. Procedures - Task 3a: Methodological Pilot Study [48](#B48-ijerph-20-03505)] p. 2. There are 27 items that are answered on a 5-point Likert scale. The overall score ranged between 27 and 135. A score < 64 indicates a low level of competence, a score of 64-98, an average level, and a score 99, a high level [ [49](#B49-ijerph-20-03505)]. [50](#B50-ijerph-20-03505)] stepwise procedure (see [Table 1](#ijerph-20-03505-t001)). [51](#B51-ijerph-20-03505)] recommend 300 cases as a good rule of thumb for factor analysis. Participants from the pilot study will not be entered into the subsequent survey (task 3b). [52](#B52-ijerph-20-03505)]. - Task 3b: A multicenter, quantitative descriptive cross-sectional survey. [53](#B53-ijerph-20-03505)] will be followed. Convenience sampling will be used to recruit educators who teach in PC advanced programs at higher education institutions in Portugal and Spain (at least 50 in each country). Convenience sampling will also be used to recruit registered practitioners from the Portuguese and Spanish PC Units (Hospitals and Community settings). To meet the statistical requirements, the investigators will recruit a minimum of 500 participants. Data will be collected via an online self-report questionnaire (Google form) through the mailing lists and intranet of the Portuguese Association of Palliative Care [APCP] and the Spanish Society of Palliative Care [SECPAL]. [54](#B54-ijerph-20-03505)] [to measure personal, communal, environmental, and transcendental spiritual well-being]; (c) Coping with Death Scale [ [55](#B55-ijerph-20-03505)] [to access skills for facing death, as well as beliefs and attitudes about these capacities]; (d) Spirituality and Spiritual Care Rating Scale [ [56](#B56-ijerph-20-03505)] [to identify the perceptions towards spirituality and spiritual care]; and (e) Spirituality Care Competency Scale (SCCS) [ [57](#B57-ijerph-20-03505)] that was reported to be reliable in previous studies [ [58](#B58-ijerph-20-03505)], but lacks Portuguese and Spanish validation. All instruments have Portuguese and Spanish versions except the SCCS, which will be adapted and validated for this project (task 3a). - Task 4: A multisite, descriptive, and contextual qualitative study. [59](#B59-ijerph-20-03505)]. [60](#B60-ijerph-20-03505)]. The first phase, familiarization, entails in-depth understanding and involvement with the data. The second phase, coding, involves detecting and labeling significant data features. The third phase implies looking for themes and concentrating the codes on an overarching topic. Next, the themes are reviewed\u2014in two parts: (i) in relation to the collected, coded data for each topic and (ii) in relation to the data set. Then, the themes are named and defined by identifying the core of each theme. Lastly, there is the final analysis and writing up of results. Long-term participation in data collection until data saturation will assure legitimacy. All participating researchers will be subjected to member verification and peer debriefing. The study will follow the COREQ checklist [ [61](#B61-ijerph-20-03505)]. 2.1.3. Phase III Purpose Procedures - Task 5: A multi-phase modified Delphi method [62](#B62-ijerph-20-03505)] with three rounds will be undertaken. Based on the findings of previous studies, the research team will provide the first proposal of spiritual care competency criteria for PC practice and education. This will provide specialists with the knowledge they need to create ideas and topics regarding the phenomena. The proposal will be emailed to experts who will assess the summarized items and rank them in terms of priority. A consensus among expert ranks will be sought. [63](#B63-ijerph-20-03505)] p. 231. - Task 6: White Book 2.2. Ethical Considerations 3. Discussion [64](#B64-ijerph-20-03505)]. This paradigm shift recognizes spirituality as an inner resource for health that improves patient outcomes such as healing, growth, coping, hope, and purpose [ [65](#B65-ijerph-20-03505)]. Competencies are necessary to guarantee that spiritual care and practice are person-centered, timely, effective, and safe in the environment in which they are provided, with the overarching goal of improving patient welfare [ [65](#B65-ijerph-20-03505)]. Using a competency-based learning approach assists in providing healthcare workers with the necessary knowledge, abilities, and attitudes to practice with confidence [ [66](#B66-ijerph-20-03505)]. We also believe that this study (from a multi-professional stance) will provide a foundation for the Iberian context to clearly define the skills necessary for spiritual care, how to teach them, and how to apply and evaluate them in the PC field. Our ultimate aim includes dissemination of our findings in peer-reviewed journals, professional conferences, and through brief reports for participating entities and stakeholders. The participation of the associations APCP and SECPAL will be crucial to this purpose. 4.
