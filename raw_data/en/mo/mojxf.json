Reconstruction of these injuries is extremely challenging due to the amount of bone that must be reconstructed and the size of wounds that must be closed.

According to J. Spence Reid, MD, Penn State Bone and Joint Institute, \"Although we know that certain factors like smoking and diabetes, and some medications are associated with impaired bone healing; in some cases it's unexplained. \" Among the nearly 8 million fractures that occur annually in the United States, approximately 10 percent of these, or 800,000 show impaired healing or non-union.

Young women are at particular risk, with two to eight times the incidence of ACL injury compared to men.

Juliano, MD, professor of foot and ankle orthopaedics, noticed what seemed to be a higher than average rate of post-surgical wound complications among patients with hypothyroidism. Juliano observed, \"Complications in these patients included not only infection, but also wound dehiscence,\" a problem not commonly seen following foot and ankle surgery, marked by opening of the wound along natural or surgical suture lines.

In recent years, however, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) has been gaining acceptance as a treatable source of the pain.
