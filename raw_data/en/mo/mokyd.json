Ensuring we have a flow of clean air in the home can make a huge difference to our wellbeing, especially for allergic or sensitive people. Common triggers such as mould or dust mites can cause asthma, eczema, hayfever and rhinitis, resulting in health misery for many of us. The Healthy House, a family run business that offers support, advice and products for allergic people, has a full list of products that can help clean the air, such as the Airfree range. A new addition to the line is the Airfree E40, an affordable air sterilizer option that is effective within a room up to 16 sq m. The advantages of Airfree are: - It is maintenance free and completely silent so will not disturb sleep; - It kills mould, helping to improve symptoms of mould and dust mite allergy; - It destroys bacteria, ozone, and airborne particles helping to keep you healthy; - Within fourteen to twenty one days the level of microorganisms and allergens will have been reduced by 85% and from then on are kept to a minimum. Maxima Skelton, of The Healthy House, uses Airfree products in her own home, after experiencing severe environmental sensitivities in her own family. She says: \"It can be very dispiriting to suffer from asthma and similar conditions, making you feel not only physically unwell but also depressed and anxious at certain times of year... We use the Airfree ourselves and it has made a significant difference to the way we feel when we are at home, helping to eradicate often unseen mould, and contribute to a generally healthier home environment.\" Further Information The Airfree E40 is available for \u00a3119. Please contact The Healthy House either on Tel: [www.healthyhouse.co.uk](http://www.healthyhouse.co.uk/) which features a wide selection of information and advice on allergies.

The retreat, which has its own pool, is surrounded by beautiful, lush Spanish countryside, just a couple of miles from the beach and within easy access of Alicante airport. The health centre's revolutionary juice and vegan diet - known as a 'nutritarian' plan - offers the ultimate detox and weight loss experience, with visitors shedding up to 1.5 stone in just two weeks and those with serious conditions, including Type 2 Diabetes, now living without medication long-term. In addition to the immersion getaway - so-called because guests become completely immersed in the experience - there is a huge selection of complementary therapies available, including colonic hydrotherapy, as well as exercise, yoga and one-to-one life coaching sessions, plus a host of beauty treatments. The Obsidian Programme The day starts with yoga and meditation with a qualified instructor, followed by a nutritious morning juice packed with fruit and raw / plant foods such as beetroot, carrots, celery and cucumber, prepared by Juicing Therapist Carol West. A daily circuit session gets the heart racing ahead of a lunchtime smoothie, which again is part of each day's planned calorie intake and nutritionally balanced. After siesta time, guests are on the go again with a rebounding class. Early evening is the perfect time to enjoy one of a range of treatments available before an alfresco evening meal taken in the courtyard. Evenings are set aside for learning, with guest speakers including meditation expert, Bodin Woodward, workshops and educational DVDs showing examples of Obsidian's approach in the USA. There are also cookery demonstrations and juicing education courses held each week. Medical Monitoring At the beginning and end of each guest's stay they have a personal assessment.

Studies will determine whether effectiveness of homeopathic remediation is compromised by dietary factors and whether minor dietary alterations or supplementation can be used to increase the effectiveness of specific homeopathic remedies and identify the genetic systems that individual remedies may target. Project 1. Investigation into the role of methionine intake in effectiveness of homeopathic remediation. Is the efficacy of homeopathic remediation affected by dietary intake of methionine? Foods that are rich in methionine include fish and meats, therefore those on a mainly vegetarian diet may have insufficient dietary intake of methionine to regulate gene expression optimally. The effectiveness of various remedies will be compared between clients that are strict vegetarians, partial vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Conditions to be treated will include eczema, psoriasis, asthma, migraine, tonsillitis and arthritis. Most conditions to be examined, however, may have quite different underlying causes. For example, asthma and eczema may or may not be associated with atopy, or elevated levels of IgE and a family history. Similar symptoms may also be caused by exposure to various environmental agents that do not induce a typical allergic or atopic reaction and are not associated with elevated IgE levels. With regard to psoriasis, if known, the practitioner is asked to comment on whether the patient suffers from the common plaque form of psoriasis, the pustular form or the guttate form involving the skin. With regard to migraine, practitioners are requested to record whether the onset of the migraine attack was preceded by impaired vision or an aura experience as well as the usual frequency of onset. As well as timely pain relief, the practitioner is asked to comment on whether the frequency of onset has been reduced. With regard to arthritis, if clinical diagnostic information is available, the practitioner is asked to record whether the arthritic condition has been diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, septic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or part of any other disease condition such as systemic lupus erythematosus. If known, the practitioner is ask to record whether the tonsillitis is associated with a bacterial, streptococcal or non-streptococcal infection, a viral infection such as EBV or Coxsackie virus or other contributory factor.

Softback. \u00a312.36. ISBN: 1905367236. John Gibbon's new book Muscle Energy Techniques provides one of the most up-to-date and in-depth insights into this increasingly popular technique. Muscle energy techniques (METs) are a form of osteopathic manipulative diagnosis and treatment in which the patient's muscles are actively used on request, from a precisely controlled position. Muscle Energy Techniques: A Practical Guide for Physical Therapists is relevant for anyone with an interest in physical therapy, and particularly those looking to expand and hone their skills. The book covers such topics as the theory of muscle energy techniques, muscle imbalances, core muscle relationships, and specific testing for muscle weakness. METs are unique in their application, as the patient provides the initial effort and the practitioner simply helps facilitate the process. The primary force is from the contraction of the patient's muscles, which is then utilised to assist and correct the musculoskeletal dysfunction. Muscle Energy Techniques: A Practical Guide for Physical Therapists is one of the only books of its kind currently on the market covering METs in such complete and concise detail. The book breaks down the theory and practice of METs, provides the reader with in-depth anatomical and physiological information and even documents specific testing exercises which can be undertaken to test for muscle weakness. Despite the thorough and in-depth information provided, however, the book remains hugely accessible to all through the use of numerous colour photographs and illustrations, aiding reader understanding of complex anatomical and physiological concepts as well as clearly illustrating practical MET techniques and exercises.
