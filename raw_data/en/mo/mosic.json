There's been at least a dozen major studies that have found that early childhood vaccines do not cause autism. Supporters of the anti-vaccination movement have often pointed to one flaw in the research data to date: that immunizations might cause autism in those children already predisposed to develop the disorder. [A study](https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2275444&resultClick=3) published in The Journal of the American Medical Association surveyed nearly 100,000 children has finally addressed that issue as well. It found that exposure to the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine had no correlation with the diagnosis of autism among toddlers who had an elevated risk for the condition. The study focused on children who had siblings who were on the autism spectrum since autism tends to run in families and made those children more high-risk for autism. But the study found that even among these high-risk little siblings, there was no link between their exposure to the (MMR) vaccine and a diagnosis of autism. This is a major breakthrough for parents who fear their child's predisposition for autism could be exacerbated by the (MMR) vaccine. The study proves that parents should feel safe vaccinating kids, even if they have a child on "}
