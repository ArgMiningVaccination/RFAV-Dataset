You should be prepared for hot weather. If you intend on trekking or mountaineering: - never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company - buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation - ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity - ensure that you're properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard - inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp - obtain detailed information on trekking routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails or slopes Remote areas Some regions in Australia's interior are very isolated and have small populations. Services are scarce. You may have difficulty getting adequate mobile phone coverage if you travel there by car. - Avoid travelling alone - Inform relatives of your itinerary Road safety Road conditions and road safety are very good throughout the country. Exercise caution when driving in rural areas at night. Drivers often drive at excessive speeds. Roaming animals and road trains pose further hazards. Access to some remote locations may be impossible during severe weather conditions. Due to the great distances between settlements and the isolation of many outback areas: - avoid travelling in extreme heat conditions - plan your overland route carefully - provide a friend or relative with your itinerary, and ensure that your vehicle is in good repair - carry a first-aid kit and personal medication - carry sufficient fuel, water, and food supplies - bring a satellite phone or an emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) Air travel We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.

Pre-travel vaccines and medications You may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary. Yellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements [Yellow fever](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/yellow-fever.html) is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito. Travellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection. Risk - There is no risk of yellow fever in this country. Country Entry Requirement* - Proof of vaccination is required if you are coming from or have transited through an airport of a country [where yellow fever occurs.](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission-and-countries-requiring-yellow-fever-vaccination-(november-2022)) Recommendation - Vaccination is not recommended. - Discuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional. - Contact a designated [Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre%20)well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination. [Yellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre%20) * It is important to note that [country entry requirements](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/vaccination-requirements-and-recommendations-for-international-travellers-and-malaria-situation-per-country-2022-edition) may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest [diplomatic or consular office](http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?view=d) of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements. Hepatitis B [Hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b.html) is a disease of the liver spread through blood or other bodily fluids. Travellers who may be exposed (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) should get vaccinated. Measles [Measles](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles.html) is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air. Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles. Japanese encephalitis [Japanese encephalitis](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/japanese-encephalitis.html) is a viral infection that can cause swelling of the brain. It is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Risk is very low for most travellers. Travellers at relatively higher risk may want to consider vaccination for JE prior to travelling. Travellers are at higher risk if they will be: - travelling long term (e.g. more than 30 days) - making multiple trips to endemic areas - staying for extended periods in rural areas - visiting an area suffering a JE outbreak - engaging in activities involving high contact with mosquitos (e.g., entomologists) Influenza Seasonal [influenza](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza.html) occurs worldwide. The flu season usually runs from November to April in the northern hemisphere, between April and October in the southern hemisphere and year round in the tropics. Influenza (flu) is caused by a virus spread from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Get the flu shot. COVID-19 [Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) ](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html)is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air. It is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally. Before travelling, verify your destination's COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19. Rabies In this destination, [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) may be present in some wildlife species, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. If you are bitten or scratched by an animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. Before travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who will be working directly with wildlife.

Dengue - In this country, risk of [dengue](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/infectious-diseases/viral-haemorrhagic-fevers/dengue-fever.html)is sporadic. It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites. - Dengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal. - The level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region. - Mosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset. [Protect yourself from mosquito bites](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/insect-bite-prevention.html). There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue fever. Animal precautions Some infections, such as [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves. Travellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game. Closely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals. Person-to-person infections Stay home if you're sick and practise proper [cough and sneeze etiquette](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#hygiene), which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand.
