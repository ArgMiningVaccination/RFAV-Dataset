In ancient China, it was believed that illness is caused by an imbalance of vital energies in the body, and while we've moved beyond that into a better explanation for common ailments, the facts remain that acupuncture has been shown to be effective in relieving pain and enhancing natural healing by improving blood flow to the affected area. At All Pets Veterinary Hospital, we obtain the best results by using acupuncture as a supplement to medical therapy to help restore health and vitality in the pets we treat. The Acupuncture Technique Acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into an animal's body at precise points called meridians, where the blood vessels converge with the nerves. The needles help guide vital energy along these meridians, supporting the nervous system and promoting circulation while enhancing the body's healing abilities. Common Reasons Dog and Cat Acupuncture is Used Our vets often recommend the use of acupuncture or other types of Chinese medicine for a number of issues, including: [Pain Management](#) Medical treatments such as chemotherapy can feel very uncomfortable for your pet. They will often be combined with acupuncture in an effort to relieve some discomfort, helping your cat or dog to fight their illness.
