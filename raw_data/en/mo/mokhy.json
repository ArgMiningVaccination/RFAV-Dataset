Screening NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | Screening 88 NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 7 A. General Guideline Principles The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines (MTG) and are applicable to all Workers' Compensation Medical Treatment Guidelines. A.1 Medical Care Medical care and treatment required as a res ult of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities with a focus on a return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. A.2 Rendering Of Medical Services Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work -related injuries and/or illnesses. A.3 Positive Patient Response Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily livi ng (ADL), cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function may be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation in proportion to the injury. A.4 Re-Evaluate Treatment If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results within a well - defined timeframe, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of t he treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. These timeframes may be slightly longer in the context of conditions that are inherently mental health issues, and shorter for other non -musculoskeletal medical cond itions (e.g. pulmonary, dermatologic etc.). Recognition that treatment failure is at times attributable to an incorrect diagnosis a failure to respond should prompt the clinician to reconsider the diagnosis in the event of an unexpected poor response to an otherwise rational intervention. A.5 Education Education of the patient and family, as well as the employer, insurer, policy makers and the community should be a primary emphasis in the treatment of work -related injury or illness. Practitioners should develop and implement effective educational strategies and skills. An education -based paradigm should always start with communication providing reassuring information to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 8 group patient education as a means of facilitating self-management of symptoms and prevention of future injury. Time Frames A.6 Acuity Acute, Subacute and Chronic are generally defined as timeframes for disease stages: Acute - Less than one month Subacute - One to three month, and Chronic - greater than three months. A.7 Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation refers to the acute timeframe following an injury and is not used to define when a given physician first evaluates an injured worker (initial encounter) in an office or clinical setting. A.8 Diagnostic Time Frames Diagnostic time frames for conducting diagnostic testing commence on the date of injury. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.9 Treatment Time Frames Treatment time frames for specific interventions commence once treatments have been initiated, not on the date of injury. It is recognized that treatment duration may be impacted by disease process and severity, patient compliance, as well as availability of services. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.10 Delayed Recovery For those patients who fail to make expected progress 6 -12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis and re -evaluation of the treatment program should be perform ed. When addressing a clinical issue that is not inherently a mental health issue, assessment for potential barriers to recovery (yellow flags/psychological issues) should be ongoing throughout the care of the patient. At 6-12 weeks, alternate treatment programs, including formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation should be considered. Clinicians must be vigilant for any pre -existing mental health issues or subsequent, consequential mental health issues that may be impacting recovery. For issues that are clearly and inherently mental health issues from the outset (i.e. when it is evident that there is an underlying, work -related, mental health disorder as part of the claim at issue), referral to a mental health provider can and should occur much sooner . Referrals to mental health providers for the evaluation and management of delayed recovery do not indicate or require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological condition. The evaluation and management of NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 9 delayed recovery does not require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological claim. Treatment Approaches A.11 Active Interventions Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. A.12 Active Therapeutic Exercise Program Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, sensory integration, coordination, cognition and behavior (when at issue) and education as clin ically indicated. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings. A.13 Diagnostic Imaging And Testing Procedures Clinical information obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection of imaging procedures and interpretation of results. All diagnostic procedures have characteristic specificities and sensitivities for various diagnoses. Usually, selection of one procedure over others depends upon various factors, which may include: relative diagnostic value; risk/benefit profile of the procedure; availability of technology; a patient's tolerance; and/or the treating practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis, a second diagnostic procedure is not required. However, a subsequent diagnostic procedure including a repeat of the original (same) procedure can be performed, when the specialty physician (e.g. physiatrist, sports medicine physician or other appropriate specialist) radiologist or surgeon documents that the initial study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis. Therefore, in such circumstances, a repeat or complementary diagnostic procedure is permissible under the MTG. It is recognized that repeat imaging studies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and/or to follow the progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g., imaging studies) during the course of care to reassess or stage the pathology when there is progression of symptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and/or therapeutic injections when clinically indicated, and post -operatively to follow the healing process. Regarding serial imaging, (including x -rays, but particularly CT scans), it must be recognized that repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. A given diagnostic imaging proce dure may provide the same or distinctive NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 10 information as obtained by other procedures. Therefore, prudent choice of procedures(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combination with other procedures(s), or a prope r sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, minimize the likelihood of adverse effect on patients, and promote efficiency by avoiding duplication or redundancy. A.14 Surgical Interventions Consideration of surgery should be within the context of expected functional outcome. The concept of \"cure\" with respect to surgical treatment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical cour se and imaging and other diagnostic tests. A comprehensive assimilation of these factors must lead to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). For surgery to be performed to treat pain, there must be clear correlation b etween the pain symptoms and objective evidence of its cause. In all cases, shared decision making with the patient is advised. The patient should be given the opportunity to understand the pros and cons of surgery, potential for rehabilitation as an alternative where applicable, evidence -based outcomes, and specific surgical experience. A.15 Pre-Authorization All diagnostic imaging, testing procedures, non -surgical and surgical therapeutic procedures, and other therapeutics within the criteria of the Medical Treatment Guidelines and based on a correct application of the Medical Treatment Guidelines are consider ed authorized, with the exception of the procedures listed in section 324.3(1)(a) of Title 12 NYCRR. These are not included on the list of pre -authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. Second or subsequent procedures (the repeat performance of a surgical procedure due to failure of, or incomplete success from the same surgical procedure performed earlier, if the Medical Treatment Guidelines do not specifically address multiple procedures) also require pre-authorization. A.16 Psychological/Psychiatric Evaluations In select patients, mental health evaluations are essential to make, secure or confirm a diagnosis. Of course, the extent and duration of evaluations and/or interventions by mental health professionals may vary, particularly based on whether: the underlying clinical issue in the claim is inherently a mental health issue; or there is a mental health issue t hat is secondary or consequential to the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question; or there is a pre- NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 11 existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question. Tests of psychological function or psychometric testing, when indicate d, can be a valuable component of the psychological evaluation in identifying associated psychological, personality and psychosocial issues. Although these instruments may suggest a diagnosis, neither screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosis should only be made after careful analysis of all available data, including from a thorough history and clinical interview. A professional fluent in the primary language of the patient is strongly preferred. When such a provider is not available, services of a professional language interpreter must be provided. Frequency: When assessing for a pre -existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) a work - relate d, medical injury or illness, then a one -time visit for initial psychiatric/psychological encounter should be sufficient, as care would normally be continued by the prior treating provider. If psychometric testing is indicated by findings in the initial en counter, time for such testing should not exceed an additional three hours of professional time. For conditions in which a mental health issue is a central part of the initial claim, or in which there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequen tial to the work -related, medical injury or illness, that is part of the claim in question, then more extensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may be clinically indicated, and are discussed in detail in the Medical Treatment Guidelines for such m ental health conditions. A.17 Personality/Psychological/Psychosocial Intervention Following psychosocial evaluation, when intervention is recommended, such intervention should be implemented as soon as possible. This can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatment modalities. For all psychological/psychiatric interventions, there must be an assessment and treatment plan with measurable behavioral goals, time frames and specific interventions planned . Time to produce effect: two to eight weeks. Optimum duration: six weeks to three months. Maximum duration: three to six months. Counseling is not intended to delay but rather to enhance functional recovery. For PTSD Psychological Intervention: Optimum duration three to six months. Maximum duration: nine to twelve months. NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 12 For select patients, longer supervision and treatment may be required, and if further treatment is indicated, documentation of the nature of the psychological factors, as well as projecting a realistic functional prognosis, should be provided by the authorized treating practitioner every four weeks during the first six months of treatment. For treatment expected to last six to twelve months, such documentation should be provided every four to e ight weeks. For long -term treatment beyond twelve months, such documentation should be provided every eight to twelve weeks. All parties should strive for ongoing and continuous communications, in order to facilitate seamless, continuous and uninterrupted treatment. A.18 Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) Functional capacity evaluation is a comprehensive or more restricted evaluation of the various aspects of function as they relate to the patient's ability to return to work. Areas such as endurance, lifting (dynamic and static), postural tolerance, specific range -of-motion, coordination and strength, worker habits, employability, as well as psychosocial, cognitive, and sensory perceptual aspects of competitive employment may be evaluated. C omponents of this evaluation may include: (a) musculoskeletal job (g) pain assessment/psycholo gical screening; (h) non- material and material handling activities; (i) cognitive and behavioral; (j) visual; and (k) sensory perceptual factors. In most cases, the question of whether a patient can return to work can be answered without an FCE. An FCE may be considered at time of MMI, following reasonable prior attempts to return to full duty throughout course of treatment, when the treating physician is unable to make a clear determination on work status on case closure. An FCE is not indicated ear ly during a treatment regime for any reason including one to support a therapeutic plan. When an FCE is being used to determine return to a specific job site, the treating physician is responsible for understanding and considering the job duties. FCEs cannot be used in isolation to determine work restrictions. The authorized treating physician must interpret the FCE in light of the individual patient's presentation and medical and personal perceptions. FCEs should not be used as the sole criteria to dia gnose malingering. A.19 Return To Work For purposes of these guidelines, return to work is defined as any work or duty that the patient is able to perform safely. It may not be the patient's regular work. Ascertaining a return to work status is part of medical care, and should be included in the treatment and rehabilitation plan. It is normally addressed at every outpatient visit. A description of the patient's status and task limitations is part of any treatment plan and should provid e the basis for restriction of work activities when warranted. Early return to work should be a prime goal in treating NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 13 occupational injuries. The emphasis within these guidelines is to move patients along a continuum of care and return to work, since the prognosis of returning an injured worker to work drops progressively the longer the worker has been out of work. A.20 Job Site Evaluation The treating physician may communicate with the employer or employer's designee, either in person, by vide o conference, or by telephone, to obtain informationregarding the individual or specific demands of the patient's pre - injury job. This may include a description of the exertional demands of the job, the need for repetitive activities, load lifting, static or awkward postures, environmental exposures, psychological stressors and other factors that would pose a barrier to re -entry, risk of re -injury or disrupt convalescence. When returning to work at the patient's previous job tasks or setting is not feasible, given the clinically determined restrictions on the patient's activities, inquiry should be made about modified duty work settings that align with, the patient's condition in view of proposed work activities/demands in modified duty jobs. It should be noted, that under certain circumstances, more than one job site evaluation may be indicated. Ideally, the physician would gain the most information from an on -site inspection of the job settings and activities; but it is recognized that this may not be feasible in most cases. If job videos/CDs/DVDs are available from the employer, these can contribute valuable information, as can video conferences, conducted from the worksite and ideally workstation or work area. Frequency: one or two contacts 1st contact: Patient is in a functional state where the patient can perform some work. 2nd contact: Patient has advanced to state where the patient is capable of enhanced functional demands in a work environment. The physician shall document the conversation. Other A.21 Guideline Recommendations And Medical Evidence The Workers' Compensation Board and its Medical Advisory Committee have not independently evaluated or vetted the scientific medical literature used in support of the guidelines, but have relied on the methodology used by the developers of various guidelines utilized and referenced in these Guidelines. A.22 Experimental/Investigational Treatment Medical treatment that is experimental/investigational and not approved for any purpose, application or indication by the FDA is not permitted under these Guidelines. NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 14 A.23 Injured Workers As Patients In these Guidelines, injured workers are referred to as patients recognizing that in certain circumstances there is no doctor-patient relationship. A.24 Scope Of Practice These Guidelines do not address scope of practice or change the scope of practice. NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 15 Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders Effective date will coincide with the launch of OnBoard: Limited Release B. Introduction to Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders Work -related depression and depressive disorders (DDD) may include a wide array of diagnoses, including but not necessarily l imited to Major Depressive Disorder, Depre ssive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Adjustment Disorder and Substance/Medication -Induced Depressive Disorder. Each of these conditions have distinguishing characteristics, and inclusion of all of them in this guideline (for pur poses of thoroughness) is not intended to imply that they are all the same, or that they can all be treated in exactly the same manner. Rather, these guidelines will provide the definitions of each of these disorders, briefly explain their distinctions, an d then provide a discussion of various diagnostic and therapeutic modalities that may prove clinically effective, if applied appropriately in the given context. The essential features of a major depressive episodes are a period of at least two weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. A diagnosis based on a single episode is possible, although the disorder is generally recurrent. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) involves multiple symptoms of depression that persist and significantly interfere with normal social and/or occupational functioning. Examples of symptoms include depressed mood, reduced interests or pleasure, weight changes, sleep disruption, fatigue, and reduced ability to think. Suicidal thoughts or attempts may occur. Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition is characterized by: a prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interes t or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture; evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical conditio n; no evidence that the disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder; the disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium; and the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The DSM -5 defines Adjustment Disorder as \"the presence of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor(s) occurring within three months of the onset of the stressor(s).\" (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 16 The DSM -5 Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication -Induced Depressive Disorder include: prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities; evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of BOTH onset of the depressive symptoms during or soon after substance i ntoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication, AND the involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms; the disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder that is not substance/medication -induced; the disturba nce does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium; and the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. B.1 History and Examination Establishing a working diagnosis in a patient with depressive symptoms entails a focused clinical interview, physical examination, and pertinent laboratory and other testing with an eye toward identifying remediable co -occurring conditions or alternative diagnoses. DSM -5 criteria should be used to diagnose DDD. Co - occurring conditions or experiences do not preclude a diagnosis of DDD yet are important in treatment planning. Physical examination supports the clinical interview and mental status exam with attention to any neurologic deficits, evidence of endocrine or other metabolic disease or systemic illness. Laboratory testing is performed as clinically indicated. Useful tests may include thyroid studies (thyroid -stimulating hormone [TSH]), complete blood count (CBC), chemistry profile, pregnancy screen, and/or toxicology panel. Use of a structured instrument such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 9 can facilitate the collection of information required to diagnosis DDD based on DSM criteria, establishing a quant ifiable baseline severity of symptoms that can also be used for tracking treatment response. NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 17 B.2 Diagnosis Table 1: DSM 5 Diagnostic Criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Criterion A : Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2 -week period and represent a change from previous functioning: at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. 1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.) 2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation). 3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month) or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.) 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day. 5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down). 6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self -reproach or guilt about being sick). 8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others). 9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition. Criterion B: The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Criterion C: The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another medical condition. Criterion D: The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Criterion E: There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode. Note: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic -like or hypomanic -like episodes are substance -induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition. Note : Criterion A through C represent a major depressive episode NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 18 Table 2: DSM 5 Diagnostic Criteria for Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition Criteria A: A prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture. Criteria B: There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition. Criteria C: The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, in which the stressor is a serious medical condition). Criteria D: The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. Criteria E: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Specifically, if: With depressive features : Full criteria are not met for a major depressive episode. With major depressive -like episode : Full criteria are met (except criterion C) for a major depressive episode. With mixed features: Symptoms of mania or hypomania are also present but do not predominate in the clinical picture. Differential Diagnosis Depressive disorders not due to another medical condition Determination of whether a medical condition accompanying a depressive disorder is causing the disorder depends on a) the absence of an episode(s) of depressive episodes prior to the onset of the medical condition, b) the probability that the associated medical condition has a potential to promote or cause a depressive disorder, and c) a course of the depressive symptoms shortly after the onset or worsening of the medical condition, especially if the depressive symptoms remit near the time that the medical disorder is effectively treated or remits. Medication -induced depressive disorder An important caveat is that some medical conditions are treated with medications (e.g., steroids or alpha - interferon) that can induce depressive or manic symptoms. In these cases, clinical judgement, based on all the evidence in hand, is the best way to try to separate the most likely and/or the most important of two etiological factors (i.e., association with the medical condition vs. a substance -induced syndrome). Adjustment disorders It is important to differentiate a depressive episode from an adjustment disorder, as the ons et of the medical condition is in itself a life stressor that could bring on either an adjustment disorder or an episode of major depression. The major differentiating elements are the pervasiveness the depressive picture and the number and quality of the depressive symptoms that the patient reports or demonstrates on the mental status examination. The differential diagnosis of the associated medical conditions is relevant but largely beyond the scope of the present manual. Table 3: DSM 5 Diagnostic Criteria for Adjustment Disorders Criteria A: The development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor(s) occurring within 3 months of the onset of the stressor(s). NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 19 Criteria B: These symptoms or behaviors are clinically significant, as evidenced by one or both of the following: 1. Marked distress that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor, taking into account the external context and the cultural factors that might influence symptom severity and presentation. 2. Significant impairment in social, occupational , or other important areas of functioning. Criteria C: The stress -related disturbance does not meet the criteria for another mental disorder and is not merely an exacerbation of a preexisting mental disorder. Criteria D: The symptoms do not represent normal bereavement. Criteria E: Once the stressor or its consequences have terminated, the symptoms do not persist for more than an additional 6 months. Specify whether: With depressed mood : Low mood, tearfulness, or feelings of hopelessness are predominant. With anxiety : Nervousness, worry, jitteriness, or separation anxiety is predominant. With mixed anxiety and depressed mood : A combination of depression and anxiety is predominant. With disturbance of conduct : Disturbance of conduct is predominant. With mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct : Both emotional symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and a disturbance of conduct are predominant. Unspecified : For maladaptive reactions that are not classifiable as one of the specific subtypes of adjustment disorder. Differential Diagnosis Major depressive disorder If an individual has symptoms that meet criteria for a major depressive disorder in response to a stressor, the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is not applicable. The symptom profile of major depressive disorder differentiates it from adjustment disorders. Posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder In adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In distinguishing adjustment disorders from these two posttraumatic diagnoses, there are both timing and symptom profile considerations. Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed immediately and persist up to 6 months after exposure to the traumatic event, whereas acute stress disorder can only occur between 3 days and 1 month of exposure to the stressor, and PTSD cannot be diagnosed until at least 1 month has passed sinc e the occurrence of the traumatic stressor. The required symptoms profile for PTSD and acute stress disorder differentiates them from the adjustment disorders. With regard to symptoms profiles, an adjustment disorder may be diagnosed following a traumatic event when an individual exhibits symptoms of either acute stress disorder or PTSD that do not meet or exceed the diagnostic threshold for either disorder. An adjustment disorder should also be diagnosed for individuals who have not been exposed to a traum atic event but who otherwise exhibit the full symptom profile of either acute stress disorder or PTSD. Personality disorders With regard to personality disorders, some personality features may be associated with a vulnerability to situational distress that may resemble an adjustment disorder. The lifetime history of personality functioning will help inform the interpretation of distressed behaviors to aid in distinguishi ng a long -standing personality disorder from an adjustment disorder. In addition to some personality disorders incurring vulnerability to distress, stressors may also exacerbate personality disorder symptoms. In the presence of a personality disorder, if t he symptom criteria for an adjustment disorder are met, and the stress -related disturbance exceeds what may be attributable to maladaptive personality disorder symptoms (i.e., Criterion C is met), then the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder should be made. NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 20 Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, specific psychological entities (e.g., psychological symptoms, behaviors, other factors) exacerbate a medical condition. These psychological factors can precipitate, exacerbate, or put an individual at risk for medical illness, or they can worsen an existing condition. In contrast, an adjustment disorder is a reaction to the stressor (e.g., having a medical illness). Normative stress reactions When bad things happen, most people get upset. This is not an adjustment disorder. The diagnosis should only be made when the magnitude of the distress (e.g., alterations in mood, anxiety, or conduct) exceeds what would normally be expected (which may vary in different cultures) or when the adverse event precipitates functional impairment. Table 4: DSM 5 Diagnostic Criteria for Substance/Medication Induced Depression Criteria A: A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities. Criteria B: There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2): 1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication. 2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A. Criteria C: The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder that is not substance/medication - induced. Such evidence of an independent depressive disorder could include the following: The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use. The symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication. There is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non - substance/medication -induced depressive disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non- substance/medication -related episodes). Criteria D: The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. Criteria E: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Notes Note : This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. Note : If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance -induced depressive disorder, the clinican should record \"mild [substance] use disorder\" before the substance -induced depressive disorder (e.g., mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine -induced depressive disorder\"). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance -induced depressive disorder, the clinician should or \"severe [substance] disorder,\" dependin g on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder, then the clinician should record only the substance -induced depressive disorder. Specify if: NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 21 With onset during intoxication : If criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication. With onset during withdrawal : If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal. Recording Procedures The name of the substance/medication -induced depressive disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the depressive symptoms. In cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \"with,\" followed by the name of the substance -induced depressive disorder, followed by the specification on onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring dur ing withdrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine -induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance -induced depressive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one -time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., phencyclidine -induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate -induced depressiv e disorder, with onset during withdrawal; dexamethasone -induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication). Differential Diagnosis Substance intoxication and withdrawal Depressive symptoms occur commonly in substance intoxication and substance withdrawal, and the diagnosis of substance -specific intoxication or withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation A diagnosis of substance -induced depressive disorder should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the mood symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. For example, dysphoric mood is a charact eristic feature of cocaine withdrawal. Substance/medication -induced depressive disorder should be diagnosed instead of cocaine withdrawal only if the mood disturbance is substantially more intense or longer lasting than what is usually encountered with cocaine withdrawal and is sufficiently severe to be a separate focus of attention and treatment. Primary depressive disorder A substance/medication -induced depressive disorder is distinguished from a primary depressive disorder by the fact that a substance is judged to be etiologically related to the symptoms. Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Because individuals with other medical conditions often take medications for these conditions, the clinician must consider the possibility that the mood symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the medical condition rather than the medication, in which case depressive disorder due to another medical condition is diagnosed. The history of ten provides the primary bases for such a judgement. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine empirically whether the medication is the causative agent . If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is a function of both another medical condition and substance use or withdrawal, both diagnoses (i.e., depressive disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication -induced depressive disorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the depressive symptoms are associated with substance (including a medication) ingestion or withdrawal or with another medical condition or are primary (i.e., not a function of either a substance or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive disorder would be indicated. NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 22 B.2.a DSM -IV versus DSM -5: Clinical Practice Guideline Implications When the diagnosis of DDD has been made under the DSM -IV criteria, prior to the publication of DSM -V criteria, these DDD Treatment Guidelines apply to the care of the worker. Diagnosis of DDD subsequent to the publication of the DSM -V criter ia must be consistent with the DSM -V criteria. Summary: An injured worker with a prior diagnosis of DDD under DSM - IV maintains the diagnosis of DDD and should receive care consistent with these guidelines B.3 Overview - Evaluation and Management B.3.a Screening and Monitoring While there are other tools, the PHQ -9 is an acceptable, cross - culturally validated and easy to use tool for screening, measuring and monitoring of severe depression. Additionally, PHQ -9 can be utilized for screening patients with DDD for suicide risk and the potential need for urgent/emergent mental health intervention. When screening or monitoring with the PHQ -9, attention should be paid to the last item (\"Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way?\"), as it has been associated with increased risk for a suicide attempt. Table 5: Nine Symptom Checklist (PHQ -9) Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following? Not at all Several days More than half the days Nearly every day A Little interest or pleasure in doing things? 0 1 2 3 B Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless 0 1 2 3 C Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much? 0 1 2 3 D Feeling tired or having little energy? 0 1 2 3 E Poor appetite or overeating? 0 1 2 3 F Feeling bad about yourself - or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down? 0 1 2 3 G Trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television? 0 1 2 3 H Moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed?

The PHQ -9 is utilized to monitor clinical depression over time. The results can be discussed with the patient to demonstrate improvement in symptoms. Psychometric testing may follow a positive result from a screen. While screening and psychometric tests may suggest a diagnosis, neither are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosi s should only be concluded after careful analysis of all available data, including from a thorough history and/or clinical interview. B.3.b Treatment Overview In general, first -line treatment for acute uncomplicated DDD is either cognitive behavioral therapy or pharmacotherapy with anti -depressants. For DDD due to other medical conditions, substances or medications, it is critical that the underlying cause of the DDD be addressed. Combined CBT and antidepressant treatment may be indicated; (1) when therapy with either CBT or an antidepressant does not result in improvement or resolution of symptoms in acute, mild/ moderate uncomplicated or severe DDD, or (2) in severe (i.e., PHQ -9 >20) or complicated DDD. ECT may be indicated in treatment resistant DDD . If a given treatment approach has not resulted in improvement in depressive symptoms, the treatment plan should be reevaluated. B.3.b.i Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the established nonpharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder. It is been demonstrated that a 12 to16 weeks course of individual CBT has efficacy comparable to antidepressant pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate depressive episodes, with fewer relapses after treatment is stopped. CBT also may significantly improve treatment outcomes when used in combination with pharmacotherapy, especially for patients with more severe or treatment -resistant depressive disorders. Despite compelling justification for use of CBT, there are NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 24 significant barriers to providing this form of therapy including limited availability and access to trained therapists. These limitations help explain why antidepressant pharmacotherapy, not CBT, continues to be the most commonly used treatment for depressive disorders. CBT must address workplace issues/barriers and set RTW goals as part of the treatment plan. It includes a variety of component therapies such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mindfulness, Behavioral Therapy/Behavioral Activation (BT/BA) and Interpersonal Therapy. Treatment frequency and duration may vary, based on case - specific circumstances. The healthcare provider must provide medical explanation and/or justi fication for deviation in frequency/duration from these guidelines. While this documentation is typically provided on a monthly basis during the acute phase of illness, for patients who have transitioned to a long -term, chronic phase of illness, and who ar e stable on existing treatment, this medical documentation can be provided every two to three months, in conjunction with regular clinical follow -up at those intervals. Care should be taken that such longer periods between clinic visits and reporting do not result in gaps in care. B.3.b.ii Pharmacotherapy Note : It is vitally important that prescribers appreciate the potential for drug -drug interactions and the potential for just one new prescription to significantly increase the likelihood that a pa tient will experience adverse side -effects when multiple medications are being prescribed. This particularly true for any medication that is potentially sedating, a respiratory depressant, habit forming or addictive. Therefore, extreme caution should be ex ercised whenever one is considering prescribing more than one medication with these properties. Note: For patients with certain long -term psychiatric illnesses, who are on stable doses of ongoing pharmacologic therapy, stable and uninterrupted dosing can be critical. Therefore, when clinically appropriate, prescribers may consider writing prescriptions with two to six monthly refills, in order to reduce the likelihood of prescriptions expiring in -between monthly to tri-monthly follow-up appointments. The major classes -Related Depressive Disorders | 25 atypical antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). TCAs and MAOIs are older antidepressants. They are effective however their tolerability, adverse effects, and safety profiles, often make them less acceptable than first -line antidepressants, such as the SSRIs or SNRIs. There is no evidence to suggest that one antidepressant drug class is superior to another for the treatment of DDD in terms of response and remission rates. Initial monotherapy with an SNRI, or an SSRI provides the best options for patients who do not have contraindications to these medications. The therapeutic benefits of these medications typically take two to four weeks to appear. The choice of anti-depressants should be based on safety/side effect profile, history of prior response to a specific medication, family history of response to a medication, concurrent medical illnesses and concurrently prescribed medications. B.4 Screening and Testing B.4.a Screening Tools Recommended - PHQ -9 for the identification of potential depressive disorders. Indications - Patients at risk of depressive disorders PHQ9 may not be necessary if clinical judgement is sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Benefits - Earlier identification of potential depressive disorders, assists with direc ting the patient to appropriate mental health services that include diagnostic confirmation and suicide prevention. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Generally only one administration. Repeat screening may be clinically indicated if there is a change in symptoms. However, routine screening is not recommended. Clinical correlation is required. While screening tools may suggest a diagnosis of DDD, neither screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosis can only be made after careful evaluation of all available data, including a thorough history and clinical interview. Evidence for the Use of Screening Tools B.4.a.i Monitoring NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 26 Recommended: PHQ -9, combined with clinical indicators, to monitor treatment progress (assess depressive symptoms and symptom severity) in DDD. Indication - After initiation of therapy or a change in treatment, patients with DDD should be monitored at least m onthly to track response/progress until remission is achieved. Remission is defined as a PHQ -9 score of four or less, maintained for at least one month. In patients who reach remission, assessment of symptoms should be continued periodically to monitor for relapse or recurrence, and potential suicide risk. Rationale - Since treatment is guided by the severity of depression, the PHQ -9 score can be very helpful to the clinician in monitoring the response to treatment. At minimum, monitoring should include an assessment of symptoms, completion of PHQ -9, adherence to medication and psychotherapy, and emergence of adverse effects. B.4.b Psychometric Testing Recommended - for individuals presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with DDD, where, in the judgement of the clinician, an evaluation indicates the potential for comorbid psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorders, bipolar, substance use disorders. Indication - to identify those patients with signs and symptoms of DDD and potential relevant comorbid psychiatric conditions and to assist in directing the patient to appropriate mental health services. Benefits - Provide psychometric evidence as a component of an evaluation regarding potential for depressive disorders and for other mental health disorder(s). Frequency/Dose/Duration - One-time testing unless otherwise indicated (e.g. significant changes in symptoms). Requires administration by a professionally trained mental health professional. Rationale - Clinical correlatio n is required. While these instruments may suggest a diagnosis, neither screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosis can only be made after careful clinical evaluation of all available data, including a thorough history and clinical interview. Evidence for the Use of Psychometric Testing NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 27 B.4.c Pharmacogenomics Testing Recommended - for select patients with Major Depressive Disorders (MDD). Indications - Select patients with moderate or severe MDD who are resistant to treatment despite the prior use of multiple antidepressants and/or have repeated intolerance of anti-depressant side-effects. Frequency/Dose/Duration - One assessment, especially to assess CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. B.5 Treatment Recommendations B.5.a Psychological Interventions B.5.a.i Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Recommended - for the treatment of patients with depressive disorders. Dosage/Frequency/Duration - 12 to16 week course of weekly individual CBT. Evidence for the Use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapies B.5.a.ii Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Recommended - for the treatment of patients with depressive disorders. Rationale - A key feature of these interventions is acceptance rather than avoidance of emotional pain. This acceptance is thought to reduce affective symptom severity. B.5.a.iii Behavioral Therapy/Behavioral Activation (BT/BA) Recommended - for the treatment of patients with depressive disorders. Rationale - BT for major depression refers to a class of psychotherapy interventions which treat DDD by teaching patients to increase rewarding activities. Patients learn to track their activities and identify the affective and behavioral consequences of those activities. Patients then learn techniques to schedule activities to improve mood. BT emphasizes training patients to monitor their symptoms and behaviors to identify the relationships between them. BA is a NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 28 particular v ersion of BT which targets the links between avoidant behavior and depression and expands the treatment component of BT B.5.a.iv Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) Recommended - for the treatment of patients with depressive disorders. Rationale - IPT is derived from attachment theory and treats DDD by focusing on improving interpersonal functioning and exploring relationship -based difficulties. IPT addresses the connection between patients' feelings and current difficulties in their relationships with peo ple in their life by targeting four primary areas: (1) interpersonal loss, (2) role conflict, (3) role change, and (4) interpersonal skills. B.5.a.v Mindfulness -Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) Recommended - for patients with depressive symptoms Rationale - MBCT integrates traditional CBT interventions with mindfulness -based skills, including mindfulness meditation, imagery, experiential exercises, and other techniques that aid patients in experiencing affect without necessarily attempting to chan ge it. With regard to cognitions, unlike cognitive therapy, MBCT does not so much seek to modify or eliminate dysfunctional thoughts as to become more detached and able to observe thoughts as objects. Evidence for the Use of Mindfulness Therapy B.5.a.vi CBT / Antidepressant Combined Use Recommended - for the treatment of patients with moderately severe /severe or complicated depressive disorders. Recommended - When monotherapy with either CBT or an antidepressant does not result in improvement or resolution/partial resolution of symptoms in acute, mild/ moderate uncomplicated DDD. B.5.a.vii Short -Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Recommended - for the treatment of patients with depressive disorders. Indications - Short -term psychodynamic psychotherapy may be first line treatment and is often used in addition to NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 29 antidepressants. For severe depressive disorders, is generally used as adjunctive to medications [ rather than as a stand - alone treatment. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Begin at eight sessions. May need additional blocks of eight sessions based on incremental functional gain. Evidence for the Use of Short Term Psychodynamic Psychoth erapy B.5.b Medications B.5.b.i Antidepressants Recommended - for the treatment of patients with depressive disorders. Indications - Depressive disorder where medication is clinically indicated. May be prescribed as monotherapy or in conjunction with other treatments including CBT and psychotherapy. There are many classes of anti-depressant medications used to treat depressive disorders. These include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors atypical anti-depressants. There is no evidence to suggest that one antidepressant drug class is superior to another for the treatment of DDD in terms of response and remission rates. All SSRIs, except fluvoxamine , may be used as first -line agents in the treatment of adults with DDD. Fluvoxamine is not a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for the treatment of DDD. Selection of an anti -depressant is typic ally dependent on several factors, including concomitant symptoms to potentially address simultaneously (e.g.sleep disturbance), anticipated potential for adverse effects, prior adverse effects, co -morbid psychiatric /medical illnesses, concurrently prescr ibed medication Frequency/Dose/ Duration - Providers should ensure that an appropriate dose titration and target dose range has been achieved and an adequate trial period allowed (a minimum of NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 30 four to six weeks) prior to considering discontinuing an antidepressant as a treatment failure. Patients with DDD who have received an adequate trial of initial pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy monotherapy but have achieved partial or no response should be reassessed for possible di agnostic error, the presence of co -occurring conditions, and treatment adherence. Once diagnosis and treatment adherence are confirmed, treatment should be adjusted to achieve remission. In general, monotherapy with first -line antidepressants (e.g. SSRIs, SNRIs, bupropion, mirtazapine) is preferable to combination treatment with two antidepressants because of the increased potential drug -drug interactions and adverse effects. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider switching to another first- line antidepressant (either within -class or out -of-class), or augmenting current pharmacological therapy with psychotherapy, or switching to psychotherapy in the absence of a partial response or no response to initial antidepressant monotherapy The return of s ymptoms of depression after a remission is common. Patients who achieve remission with antidepressant medication should have the medication continued for at least 6 months after remission of DDD symptoms to decrease risk of relapse. Some patients may need to continue antidepressants indefinitely. Discontinuation of Antidepressant Therapy - Should be done with a slow taper since discontinuation done too rapidly may result in adverse withdrawal symptoms or return of the original depressive symptoms. Tapering should be guided by the elimination half -life of the medication and by close monitoring of the depressive symptoms. Relapse is common. Evidence for the Use of Antidepressants B.5.b.ii Fluvoxamine Not Recommended - for the treatment of patients with depressive disorders. Rationale - Fluvoxamine, is not a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for the treatment of DDD. B.5.b.iii Antipsychotics NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 31 Recommended for augmentation of antidepressants in treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Indication - Second generation antipsychotics should be considered only when other strategies have failed because of their significant side effects. Recommended - in select patients with psychosis Indications - Treatment of depressive disorders with psychotic characteristics include: 1. Serious delusions (e.g., fixed false beliefs) 2. Visual or (typically) auditory hallucinations 3. Confusion (incoherence) 4. Catatonic behavior (e.g., motoric immobility or excessive agitation) 5. Extreme negativism or mutism 6. Peculiar movements 7. Inappropriate effect of a bizarre or odd quality 8. Severe symptoms B.5.c Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) Recommended - for patient with treatment resistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and any of the following conditions: 1. Catatonia 2. Psychotic depression 3. Severe suicidality 4. A history of a good response to ECT 5. Need for rapid, definitive treatment response on either medical or psychiatric grounds 6. Risks of other treatments outweigh the risks of ECT (i.e., co - occurring medical conditions make ECT the safest treatment alternative) 7. A history of a poor response to multiple antidepressants 8. Intolerable side effects to all classes of antidepressant medications (e.g., seizures, hyponatremia, severe anxiety) Frequency/Dose/Duration - One administration. Generally not repeated unless severe Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) recurs and is again treatment resistant. Evidence for the Use of Electroconvulsive Therapy B.5.d Adjunctive Therapies B.5.d.i Exercise NYS WCB MTG - Work -Related Depression and Depressive Disorders | 32 Recommended - for the treatment of patients with depressive disorders. Indications - Exercise may be used as adjunctive treatment to first line therapies such as CBT and/or medication. Frequency/Dose/Duration - Aerobic exercise based on clinical assessment Rationale - Improvement in depressive symptoms, increased physical function and overall well-being. Evidence for the Use of Exercise B.5.d.ii Yoga Recommended - in select patients with depressive symptoms Indications - Yoga may be used as adjunctive treatment to first line therapies such as CBT and/or medication. Rationale - Improvement in depressive symptoms, increased physical function and overall well-being. Evidence for the Use of Yoga B.5.d.iii Acupuncture Not Recommended - for the treatment of patients with depressive disorders.
