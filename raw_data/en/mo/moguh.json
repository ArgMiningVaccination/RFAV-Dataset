POS NER \"... promotes scientific inquiry, critical investigation, and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims.\"Committee for Skeptical Inquiry[ FROM THE EDITOR Violence, Here and Above Steven Pinker is one of our nation's most illustrious public intellectuals. In an insightful interview in this issue he eloquently explores the almost counterintuitive notion that despite all the violent news that bombards us daily, rates of violence worldwide are actually at historic lows. I've been fascinated by this argument and its implications ever since Pinker's book The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined came out, but this is our first opportunity to deal with it in our pages and in his words. I think you'll find it provocative reading. Pinker is a longtime Fellow of our Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. We published an adaptation from his book The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature in our March/April 2003 issue. Pinker, neuroscientist and CSI Fellow Indre Viskontas, and science jour- nalist and SI contributing editor Chris Mooney conducted the interview be-fore a live audience at the 2013 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It was originally for our Center for Inquiry's Point of Inquiry podcast and is downloadable there. For this published version in SI, Pinker, a careful, conscientious writer, made many small improvements for added clarity. * * * The half-megaton explosion caused by a sixty-foot-wide mass from the asteroid belt violently slamming into the atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in Febru-ary was an extraordinary, once-in-a-century event. Nothing else like it has been experienced since the Tunguska event of 1908, over Siberia. But this one was widely witnessed and videotaped. In this issue three prominent scientists whose specialties include such cosmic impacts describe what happened and consider the lessons and probabilities of its coincidental, but not connected, relationship in time with the nearby passage of asteroid 2012 DA14. David Morrison, Alan Harris, and Mark Boslough (all frequent SI contributors) drafted this article shortly after the historic event. By the time it got to us, Boslough was already in Chelyabinsk, where he served as the main scientist-on-the-ground for a superb special one-hour NOVA documentary about the meteor strike that aired March 27. * * * I want to call your attention to a welcome statement issued by twenty-two sec-ular and humanist organizations, including the Center for Inquiry. Titled \"An Open Letter to the Secular Community,\" it is a united call for more civility in online discussions and a pledge to improve their tone and substance. Online blogs and social media postings too often go beyond the bounds of civility. This has been a recent issue in the secular and atheist communities, but we've seen the same problem in public discourse generally. The skeptical community is not immune (see my editorial \"Can We Have Civilized Discussions about Touchy Science Policy Issues?\" SI, January/February 2013), but the S I has long been guided by our determination that authors maintain a professional tone (see our \"Guide for Authors\") and by Ray Hyman's classic set of guidelines, \"Proper Criticism.\" Both are on our csicop.org website.

Post mas S/K.sc/E.sc/P.sc Inquirer | July/August 2013 5[ NEWS AND COMMENT Conspiracy thinking seems almost endemic today. People who see con-spiracies everywhere seem to have out-of-whack information filters, allowing ideas of conspiracy to easily enter their minds but keeping critical analysis of those same ideas out. We've even recently seen that a paper by psychologists about conspiracy thinking can cause respon-dents to engage in still more of it (SI, May/June 2013, pp. 7-9). A new nationwide poll finds some interesting insights into the acceptance of different conspiracy theories. Some ideas are much more widely believed than others. In some cases\u2014as with the Iraq war or global warming\u2014the differences fall along partisan political lines, but some of the more bizarre ideas provoke bipartisan skepticism. The poll by Public Policy Polling (www.publicpolicypolling.com) of 1,247 registered American voters at the end of March 2013 found that 28 percent of voters believe that a secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world gov-ernment, or New World Order. That idea was believed by 34 percent of Republicans and 35 percent of inde-pendents, compared with just 15 per-Do You Believe That?

Someideas are much more widely believed than others.In early April, an unknown man deliv- ered a smelly box addressed to Tom Ricketts, the owner of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. Inside was a de-caying goat's head. Who would send a severed goat's head to Wrigley Stadium? A confused Satanist? An angry mobster trying to send a threat but unable to find a horse? No, it was a response to a sup- posed \"Billy Goat\" curse that dates back to 1945 when a man named Bill \"Billy Goat\" Sianis had a pet goat (named Murphy) that was refused entry to a Cubs game. Offended by the affront, according to legend he cursed the club with the words, \"The Cubs ain't gonna win no more!\" Sure enough, the Cubs lost the next game and have not won a World Series in over a century despite many fan attempts over the years to lift the curse (some of them involving goats). While some regard the curse as merely a silly superstition, many longtime fans take it very seriously. Belief in the Billy Goat curse set the stage for what happened in 2003 when a Cubs fan named Steve Bartman reached for\u2014and deflected\u2014a foul ball in Game 6 6 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirercent of Democrats. Not surprisingly, the poll found there is an intense partisan divide on whether or not global warm-ing is a hoax. Fifty-eight percent of Republicans agreed that it is a conspir-acy; 77 percent of Democrats disagree. Fifty-one percent of Americans believe a larger conspiracy was at work in the John F. Kennedy assassination fifty years ago this November; just 25 percent think Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Twenty-nine percent believe aliens exist, and 21 percent believe a UFO crashed at Roswell in 1947. But just 5 percent believe that Paul McCartney died and was secretly replaced by the Beatles in 1966, and just 7 percent of voters think the moon landing was faked. \"Even crazy conspiracy theories are subject to partisan polarization, espe-cially when there are political overtones involved,\" said Dean Debnam, pres-ident of Public Policy Polling. \"But most Americans reject the wackier ideas out there about fake moon land-ings and shape-shifting lizards.\" The accompanying box shows some of the specific results of the poll. A look at the more detailed data cross-tabulated by political affiliation shows interesting variations. For many conspiracy ideas political affiliation doesn't affect the results. This is true, for example, with the Roswell crashed saucer claim, the fake moon landing belief, belief in Bigfoot, and the belief that vaccines cause autism. But belief in a New World Order is held by 45 per-cent of those who describe themselves as \"very conservative\" but only 12 per-cent of those who describe themselves as \"very liberal.\" On the other side, the idea that the government allowed the September 11, 2001, attacks to happen is believed by only 8 percent of Repub-licans but is believed by 14 percent of Democrats. Gender differences show up on a few questions. Thirty-nine percent of men\u2014but a slightly smaller proportion of women (35 percent)\u2014believe global warming is a hoax. Twenty-four per-cent of men and 19 percent of women believe a UFO crashed at Roswell. Thirty-five percent of men but just 21 percent of women believe in the New World Order. Men and women are equal in the belief that vaccines cause autism (20 percent of both genders be-lieve that is true, but women are a little less certain about the truth; 30 percent of men but 38 percent of women are \"not sure\"). Do you find the results as bad or worse than expected? Or do you per-haps find some comfort that at least some bizarre beliefs are disbelieved by large margins? In either case, conspir-acy thinking seems likely to continue to taint our public discourse and to stay a big part of the misinformation and pseudoscience that skeptics deal with for a long time to come. Kendrick Frazier is editor of the S- I. Goat Sacrificed for Chicago Cubs Curse B R Do you find the results as bad or worse than expected? Or do you perhaps find some comfort that at least some bizarre beliefs are disbelieved by large margins? Amanda Berry, who was sixteen-years- old when she went missing in 2003, was rescued on May 6 from an unas-suming house in Cleveland where she and others are believed to have been held captive for up to a decade. Berry broke through a door and called for help and two other missing women, Gina DeJesus and Michele Knight, were also rescued from the home. The home's owner, Ariel Castro, and his two brothers were arrested in connec-tion with the case. Tragically, a high-profile psychic told Berry's mother that she was dead. For nearly two years after her disappear-ance Amanda Berry's mother, Louwana Miller, held out hope that her daugh-ter would be found alive and returned to her: Maybe Amanda ran away from home and would come back some day or was in an accident and somehow lost her memory. Miller endured the terri-ble limbo of not knowing, holding out hope against the odds but not wanting to believe the worst. As Plain Dealer writer Stephan Hudak noted, \"Desperate for any clue as to Amanda Berry's whereabouts, and tired of unanswered questions from au-thorities, Miller turned to a psychic on Montel Williams' nationally syndicated of the National League Championship Series that might have been caught by an outfielder. Bartman, who was widely blamed for the Cubs loss by both fans and the news media, received harassment and death threats. In an ESPN documentary film about that incident titled Catching Hell, Yale Professor Benjamin Polak, who analyzed the Cubs's chances of winning at each stage of the game, points out that Bartman's catch only decreased the team's chance of winning by 3 percent; far worse errors were made by the Cubs players themselves throughout that game. Yet many play-ers and fans had been looking for a bad omen, some superstitious sign that their dreams of a long-awaited vic-tory would be spoiled\u2014and Bartman was it. As Polak notes, any team of professional athletes should be able to easily overcome a 3 percent deficit introduced by a random event like fan interference. Superstitions are common in sports and competitions; for example, some professional tennis players eat exactly the same meals and stay in the same rooms at the same hotels following a big win. They think that their success must have something to do with circumstances beyond their abilities. Some poker players will wear the same \"lucky\" shirts they were wear-ing when they hit it big, and so on. However, the Billy Goat curse might be real in one way: Curses some-times work because people believe in them\u2014the same reason that placebos sometimes work. Confidence and focus are important to athletic success, and if a player loses confidence for any reason\u2014including a real or imagined curse\u2014it can affect their performance in very real ways. Either way, the sooner the Cubs win a championship, the sooner goats can rest easier. Benjamin Radford is the deputy editor of the S I.

In 2010 the director of a British company that supplied bogus bomb detectors to Iraq was arrested on fraud charges ( Jay M. Pasachoff, \"Pseudoscience and the Iraq War: Bogus 'Bomb Detectors' Cost Money and Lives,\" SI, May/June 2010). Now the head of that com- pany has been convicted of fraud and sentenced to ten years in jail. On May 2, 2013, Judge Richard Hone of Britain's central crimi-nal court sentenced British busi-nessman James McCormick, age fifty-seven, to the ten-year term. Sentencing followed his convic-tion on April 23 of fraud in the sale of more than 6,000 fake bomb detectors based on $20 golf ball finders bought from the United States. Court documents said he had made more than $75 million from sales of the fake devices in Iraq and Georgia, among other places, claiming they could detect bombs, drugs, currency, and ivory and track objects up to 3,280 feet below ground. The devices, marketed under the brand ADE, sold for up to $40,000 each, had no working electronics, and were completely useless. They were widely used at checkpoints in Iraq, giving a false sense of security. The Iraqi general who promoted the devices, Jihad al-Jabiri, then head of the Iraqi Ministry of Interior's General Di-rectorate for Combatting Explo-sives, has been jailed in the scam, along with other police officials. As McCormick sat impassively at his sentencing Judge Hone chastised him: \"Your fraudulent conduct in selling so many useless devices for simply enormous profit promoted a false sense of security and in all probability materially contributed to causing death and injury to innocent individuals. \"The device was useless, the profit outrageous, and your culpa-bility as a fraudster has to be placed in the highest category.\" IBritish Businessman Sentenced in Bogus 'Bomb Detector' Scam Businessman James McCormick arrives at the Old Bailey in Central London on the day of his conviction. Nick Edwards television show. The psychic said what the FBI, police and Miller hadn't. 'She's not alive, honey,' Sylvia Browne told her matter-of-factly. 'Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.' With those blunt words, Browne persuaded Miller to accept a grim probability that has become more likely with each pass-ing day.\" Miller returned home dev-astated, and she died two years later, believing that her daughter was dead. Sylvia Browne was horribly wrong, telling a grieving mother that her child was dead when she was not. And it's not the first time. In an eerily similar situation in 2002, Browne told the par-ents of missing child Shawn Hornbeck that their son was dead, also on Montel Williams's show. His body, she said, would be found in a wooded area near two large boulders, and he had been kidnapped by a very tall, \"dark-skinned man\" with dreadlocks. In fact, Hornbeck and another boy were found very much alive five years later on January 16, 2007, in the home of a Caucasian, non-dreadlocked Mis-souri man named Michael Devlin who had kidnapped them. Every detail of Browne's psychic vision was wrong, including the most important: that Shawn was dead. This horrific case also has many similarities to Jaycee Dugard, the girl abducted at the age of eleven in 1991 and discovered living in a virtual prison in the backyard of a couple's home in Antioch, California, eighteen years later. She had been confined, horrif-ically abused, and raped, even giving birth to her captor's children, who were also kept prisoner and isolated. Hundreds of psychics gave informa-tion about Dugard's location while she was missing\u2014and every one turned out to be completely wrong. Psychics make many claims of success, but they are conspicuously unable to find miss-ing persons and rescue innocent women from years of torture and imprisonment. A soldier at a checkpoint using an ADE 651Skeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 9I indeed pointed out in a two-sentence post that psy-chic powers had once again failed to warn the world about life-and-death trag-edies and acts of terrorism whose consequences could have been prevented or mitigated. Since no psychics came forward in the days, weeks, or months before the April 15, 2013, Boston attacks to warn authori- ties, we will never know how the situa- tion might have been different. It's a valid question, and one echoed by several others, including British skeptic Hayley Stevens, who wrote: \"Psychics are damned if they do and damned if they don't. If they'd pre-dicted bombs would explode in Boston during the Marathon we'd berate them for scaremongering. If they don't pre-dict it we berate them for not warning people.\" My answer is that if one or more psychics did foresee the event, and it could be demonstrated that they had a proven track record of accuracy in pre-vious cases (that is, it's not a random, one-time guess that anyone could do), then I would be the first person to try to help the psychics alert the police, try to identify suspects, and put them under surveillance to thwart the attack. If it's a one-time, vague prediction, I don't think anyone should take it se-riously because random events and co-incidences happen all the time (simply by random chance, thousands of peo-ple every day have seemingly prophetic dreams about events that happen the following day or week). But if there's some reason to think someone has a real predictive ability (whether explained or unexplained), then it absolutely should be taken seriously. Psychics and Police This is not merely an academic exercise or abstract thought experiment; we have enough information from real-world cases to have a pretty good idea of what would have happened to a psychic's legitimate information about the Boston bombing. The claim that police ignore psychics not only plays into the hands of these psychics (\"the problem is not that we give bad or vague information, but in-stead that we're ignored by the police\"), but it is also factually wrong. Those who aren't familiar with the history of psychic detectives may assume that po-lice routinely dismiss information com- ing from psychics as unreliable, but in fact police must follow up on all cred-ible tips about crimes, including those from dubious sources. They routinely deal with liars, hoaxers, jailhouse in-formants with dubious motives, people with drug habits and mental illnesses, and so on. Police cannot simply ignore a lead or tip even when it comes from a psychic\u2014after all, just because a per-son claims to be psychic doesn't mean that he or she may not have some real knowledge of a crime (Radford 2010). Of course it depends on what, ex- actly, our hypothetically accurate psy-chic told police: Did she or he say, \"There will be a bombing in Boston in 2013,\" or \"There will be a bomb at the Boston marathon finish line, and the name Tsarnaev is somehow connected,\" or something else? Psychics and psy-chic detectives often claim to give the names, detailed physical descriptions, ethnicities, and countless other \"spe - cific\" descriptors of wanted murderers, terrorists, and abductors to police. It is not unreasonable to assume that, out of the tens of thousands of self-pro-claimed psychics in North America and A:[SKEPTIC AL INQUIREE BENJAMIN RADFORD Benjamin Radford is a research fellow at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and author or coauthor of six books, including Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction, and Folklore.

In fact, I've encountered dozens of cases where police have followed up on even vague information from psychics. For example, in March 2004 a psychic told the Transportation Security Ad-ministration (TSA) that a bomb was aboard an American Airlines flight leaving Florida and bound for Dal- las, Texas. The psychic's bomb report resulted in a pre-boarding search by the TSA and Port Authority police; despite a thorough examination with both equipment and bomb-sniffing dogs, nothing suspicious was found. The delay forced cancellation of the flight. Doug Perkins, local administra-tor for the TSA, said that the psychic's information was taken seriously be - cause \"...we can't ignore anything. We want to take the appropriate measures.\" In 2011, the Texas police, FBI, and Texas Rangers mobilized the massive search of a remote farm based on a tip from a psychic that mass graves would be found there. There have even been cases where the FBI has actually en-listed psychics in their investigations, such as in the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 near Long Island (see Rad-ford 1999). Boston Bombing Suspects With that background, what do we know about law enforcement's knowl-edge about Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the two accused Boston bombers? Quite a bit: In October 2011, America's main counterterrorism agency, the National Counterterrorism Center, added Tamerlan Tsarnaev's name to two different government watch lists, also alerting other agencies including the FBI and its Terrorist Screening Database, the State Department, the TSA, and the Homeland Security De partment. We know that Tsarnaev's name was still on a watch list as of January 12, 2012, when his flight reser- vation to Russia flagged a security alert (Schmitt and Schmidt 2013a). In fact, the FBI dispatched two counterterrorism agents to interview Tsarnaev and his family in 2011 but found no evidence of terrorist activ-ity, leaving the case dormant. \"At that point, [an FBI] official said, 'you would need additional information, like a fol-low-up request'\" (Schmitt and Schmidt 2013b) for information or some other reason to look again at Tsarnaev as a possible threat. Which brings us back to the ques- tion of whether or not information from a psychic would have been taken seriously by authorities and investi-gated\u2014possibly preventing the attack in the first place. It seems almost cer-tain that if police had been given rea-sonably specific, accurate information about one or both of the Tsarnaev brothers (by a self-proclaimed psychic or anyone else) that someone would have taken a few seconds to enter that information in a computer system where the information had already been flagged. This is especially true given that the information would have been passed along to the FBI counter-terrorism unit in Boston\u2014the same agency that had previously investigated Tsarnaev only a year earlier, and whose agents were familiar with his profile. Any actionable information would al-most certainly have been at least briefly checked. And the information need not have been made public, avoiding the issue of scaremongering. So it's unlikely that a psychic who (correctly or incorrectly) predicted a terrorist attack would be ignored or dismissed\u2014especially if he or she could point to a history of verified, accurate predictions. If the information is vague (such as \"a bomb might go off in Bos-ton around mid-April\"), then of course it's likely that the information will be ignored. But if the information is spe-cific enough to follow up on (what's called \"actionable intelligence,\" such as names, dates, locations, and profiles), then it's very likely that the informa-tion would indeed be taken seriously and investigated. My answer is yes: I think that in this case, and many others, if police had been given useful information about the Boston attacks by psychics, it likely could have been prevented. I respect-fully disagree that psychics are damned if they do make accurate predictions and damned if they don't. The problem is that they don't\u2014and if they did I'd be the first person encouraging law en-forcement to use them to solve crimes and prevent terrorism. Anything else is simply making excuses for failure. I References Radford, Benjamin. 1999. FBI enlisted psy- chic in TWA 800 investigation. S I (July/August). \u2014\u2014\u2014. 2010.

BENJAMIN RADFORD SKEPTIC AL INQUIREE]12 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirer[ INVEST IGAT IVE FILES JOE NICKELL Mind Over Metal Can people move or alter physical objects simply by using a hidden power of the mind called psy- chokinesis? I have encountered many claims of such powers in the course of my work (since 1969) as a paranormal investigator. And I have pretended to have such ability myself\u2014both as a professional stage magician and men-talist (a magician specializing in appar-ent psychic feats). In the fall of 2012, I attended a workshop that enabled me to investigate the latest popular expres-sion of psychokinetic metal bending. Psychokinesis The term psychokinesis (formerly teleki-nesis), or PK, derives from the Greek words for \"mind\" and \"motion.\" Together with extrasensory perception (ESP), it constitutes what parapsychologists refer to as \"psi\" to describe the two seemingly closely related phenomena. However, the existence of psi has never been proven and, indeed, according to a sympathetic source: \"Despite decades of research, psi continues to elude physical and quasi-physical theories of how it func-tions; it operates outside the bounds of time and space\" (Guiley 1991, 468). PK describes the alleged power of mind over matter, including such \"mi-cro-PK\" acts as subtly influencing how thrown dice will land, or \"macro-PK\" feats like levitating a table or producing so-called \"poltergeist\" effects (actually, typically the tricks of children 1). Psy-chokinetic metal bending is another al- leged macro-PK phenomenon. Geller the PK Marvel It appears that the first major per-former of apparent PK metal bending (PK-MB) was Israeli-born former fash-ion model and nightclub magician, Uri Geller (b. 1946) (Figure 1). Claiming to be guided by super beings from a distant planet, Geller appeared to read minds, bend keys and cutlery with PK, see while blindfolded, and perform other feats\u2014all of which skilled magicians easily duplicate. (I, for example, have driven a car while blindfolded [Nickell with Fischer 1992, 77].) He typically refused to perform when magicians were observing but, nevertheless, was occasionally caught cheating. Renowned American magician and psychic investigator James \"The Amazing\" Randi once observed Geller up close. Posing as an editor when Geller performed in the offices of Time magazine, Randi saw the simple tricks behind Geller's wonderworking. For example, while Geller pretended to cover his eyes as a secretary made a simple drawing, he actually peeked, thus enabling him to appear to read her mind and reproduce the draw-ing. Again, while supposedly bending a key \"by concentration,\" Geller had instead bent it against a table when he thought he was unobserved. (For more on Geller's methods, see Randi 1982.) More Benders Geller was soon imitated by other \"psy-chics\" who discovered that they, too, could bend keys and spoons. One was Judy Knowles, who impressed London physics professor and parapsychologist John Hasted with her apparent ability. Hasted invited James Randi to observe tests of Knowles in a lab at Bath. Randi arrived with colleagues and his check-book, offering Ms. Knowles $10,000 if she successfully passed the test, which was designed by Harry Collins of the University of Bath. Collins had tested other spoon benders, but none had been successful, and some children had been caught cheating. Briefly, the test involved Knowles holding the spoon in a single hand rested on a table before a two-way mir-ror. Observers, equipped with a video Figure 1. Uri Geller seemed able to bend keys and cutlery with his thoughts.

Scotland's ancient Stirling Castle, crowning a massive volcanic crag, is allegedly haunted by \"The Green Lady.\"camera, were on the opposite, see- through side of the mirror. A candle was used to blacken the bowl of the test spoon so that, if one attempted to cheat\u2014using the thumb to press against the bowl and so cause bending\u2014the at-tempt would be revealed by the result-ing smudging. Knowles tried unsuc-cessfully to bend the spoon using PK, but after nearly two hours, she quit the test. Randi and colleagues concluded Knowles had been unsuccessful, while Hasted and associates called the results \"inconclusive\" (Randi 1978, 36-39). In the early 1980s, two young Amer- icans, Steve Shaw and Mike Edwards, convinced parapsychologists at a psy-chical research laboratory in St. Louis, Missouri, that they could use their PK powers to move objects and bend metal under test conditions. In 1983, how-ever, the duo revealed that they had perpetrated a hoax\u2014now known as Project Alpha. Having worked secretly with James Randi, they demonstrated that credulous scientists could be fooled like anyone else (Shaw 1996, 617-18; Randi 1995, 253-54). Shaw has gone on to become the internationally ac-claimed mentalist Banachek. As a colleague and friend of Bana- chek, I have seen his metal-bending effects firsthand many times, especially at one of his workshops for fellow ma-gicians and mentalists (Amherst, New York, June 16, 2009). His remarkable fork bend, whereby the tine of the fork is seen to visibly bend without being touched, is superior to any of Uri Geller's effects\u2014according to no less an authority than the late skeptic and magi - cian Martin Gardner (Shaw 1996, 615). Evolutionary Phenomenon PK metal bending has evolved over time. As we have seen, performers ap peared to bend metal by simply look- ing at it or stroking it lightly. Some-times they even allegedly bent metal remotely. The performer might suggest, for instance, that people's keys have mysteriously bent in their pockets or purses. In fact keys may become acci-dentally bent in various ways (as by the key being used in haste so that the par-tially inserted key is turned in the lock prematurely). Such an already bent key may go unnoticed until the performer calls attention to it (Shaw 1996, 619). Major claimants of PK-MB were \u2014in addition to Uri Geller\u2014Jean-Pierre Girard (France), Masuaki Riyota (Japan), and Stephen North (England), as well as another Israeli, Ronni Marcus. (In 1994, Unsolved Mysteries asked me to observe Marcus's act at a conference. However, a producer subse-quently called to say that the conference organizers had refused to allow me to participate, and the TV show there-fore withdrew its interest. I attended anyway, undercover, but Marcus was a no-show amid revelations he had been caught cheating in California and had returned to Israel [Randi 1994].) Soon, honest magicians and men- talists got into the act, demonstrating that very convincing PK-MB effects could be produced by trickery. The in-escapable inference was that perhaps the \"real\" effects were accomplished by tricks also. Among various shared secrets, some were sold through magic supply houses, including Mark Walk-er's book Key Bending (which also gave secrets to bending cutlery) (Abbott's 1987, 337). Top-flight demonstrators of the magic art of pseudo PK-MB are James Randi and Banachek. Later, laypeople began to try their hand, quite literally. Beginning in the 1980s, at metal-bending parties and workshops attendees began surpris - ing themselves with their newfound PK-MB abilities. They typically bent spoons with their hands while insisting they did not exert sufficient force to cause the extent of bending achieved. What was going on? Hands-On On the evening of August 23, 2012, my wife, Diana, and I showed up at a workshop in Lily Dale, a tiny village in Western New York that represents the world's largest spiritualist com-munity. The session was conducted by Ron Nagy, curator of the Lily Dale Museum and an old friend (Figure 2). In the spirit of openness he had invited me to attend, and we mutually agreed not to be adversarial. That is, he would not \"out\" me as a notorious skeptic, and I would not be troublesome. The ad for the workshop defined psychokinesis as \"the movement of objects without physical contact,\" then went on to promise: This workshop will explain the basic mind over matter aspects of bending metal objects and also explain how the mind and body can react together and cause harmonious health condi-tions. This workshop is intended to be fun and also provide experiences previously believed to be impossi-ble that should reduce some of the artificial limits we have placed in our lives. It may seem remarkable that with very little training one might be able to accomplish this extraordinary proof that belief in spirit and mind over Figure 2. Ron Nagy teaches well-attended workshops in \"PK\" spoon bending at Lily Dale spiritualist village. (Photo by Joe Nickell)14 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirermatter is more powerful than certain realities. (\"Spoon Bending\" 2012) For the next two hours, we held spoons (and occasionally forks) in our hands as we implored them to respond to our thoughts. To free our minds, Ron had us\u2014acting in unison\u2014jump in the air and turn around twice, while thinking the metal was bending. Sure enough, for all but one or two of the thirty or so participants, we achieved bending. I had especially good results. (See Figure 3.) Some participants seemed quite mystified. Revelation However, I could see early on that a positive attitude was helpful: Being confident that the spoon would easily bend helped overcome the negative first impression that the metal was resistant. Such is the power of positive thinking. What I think really happens in such situations is that one simply exerts suf-ficient strength to cause the bending (I was even able to put spiral twists into the handle\u2014again see Figure 3) while being somewhat distracted from the process. An ability to dissociate (to sep-arate a mental activity from the main stream of consciousness) seems a defi-nite asset, because the bending relies heavily on the ideomotor effect (the psy-chological phenomenon in which, un-consciously, one moves his or her hand sufficiently to affect dowsing rods, Oui-ja-board planchettes, and partygoers have inadver- tently described the very processes I have explained. One wrote, \". . . we needed to create an atmosphere of ex-citement and emotional arousal.\" The party host, an engineer named Jack Houck, \"encouraged us to be noisy and excited.\" The writer added, \"The only thing I noticed is that spoon bending seemed to require a focused attention. You had to try to get it to bend, and then you had to forget about it. Maybe talk to someone else while you rubbed the spoon. . . . If you kept watching the spoon, worrying over it, it was less likely to bend\" (\"Spoon Bending\" 2013). The ad for our workshop defined PK as occurring \"without physical contact\"; this means that PK was not demonstrated by the participants, since they had held the cutlery in both hands in the very way one would in order to deliberately bend it. But this work-shop did not involve trickery. The only deception that seemed involved was self-deception.

His essays can be found at rationallyspeaking.org. Suppose you are the mother of three children. You are having a nice picnic with them and wish to divide up the strawberries in your basket equally, without cutting them (because you don't want to be messy). The problem is: there are twen-ty-three strawberries in your basket, which means that you cannot actually accomplish the feat you intended to accomplish. Why not? The explana-tion is mathematical, not just physical, and in some sense more fundamental than a physical explanation would be. Or take another well-known problem, at least in philosophical circles. The formerly Prussian town of K\u00f6nigsberg (where Immanuel Kant was born and lived) has a number of bridges that go over a river and its fork in several places. Now, nobody has been able so far (nor is there any expectation that anyone will be able in the future) to cross all bridges in K\u00f6nigsberg exactly once while remaining either on land or on a bridge (i.e., without using boats) and while always completing the cross-ing of a given bridge once he started to walk on it. Why not? Because\u2014as philosopher Marc Lange explains in a 2012 paper that appeared in the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science\u2014the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg are arranged as a particular type of network that makes it impossible to accomplish that feat. Again, the explanation for the fail-ure is distinctively mathematical, not physical. The reason I am bringing this up is because skeptics are very aware of what philosophers refer to as the \"modality\" of science, but they tend to be some-what more oblivious to other forms of modality, such as logical or mathemat- ical. Modality, in philosophy, refers to the necessity of certain things. So for instance, the law of conservation of en-ergy makes perpetual motion machines physically (modally) impossible. That is, there is no way to build perpetual motion machines without violating a fundamental law of physics. This is why the U.S. Patent Office long ago stopped even considering applications for such machines, and it is also why the skeptic doesn't really have to empirically inves-tigate claims of perpetual motion: we know a priori that they must be false because of the strong modality of the law of conservation of energy. The idea that some philosophers have put forth, and that Lange nicely explores in the paper I've mentioned, is that there is a range of increasingly stronger modalities, where the phys-ical one is, perhaps to the chagrin of \"fundamental\" physicists, actually the weakest. We have seen two examples of mathematical modality, in which the explanation of the physical impossibil-ity of two tasks transcends physics itself, since under any set of laws of physics it would still be impossible to evenly dis-tribute the twenty-three uncut straw-berries among the three children, or to cross all of the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg exactly once. Consider now Newton's second law of motion, another example brought up by Lange. The law is sum-marized by the simple mathematical equation F = ma, where F is the force acting on a body, m is its mass, and a is its acceleration. The interesting thing is that the law is independent of the spe-cific causal framework within which a given force acts (it would hold, for in-stance, even if gravity followed an in-verse cube, rather than an inverse square decay curve), which means that the mo-dality (i.e., the necessity) of Newton's second law is stronger than that of other physical facts about our universe. Figure 1. The bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg.16 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical InquirerOr consider the principle of natural selection in biology. Its original Dar- winian formulation was famously re-stated by geneticist Richard Lewontin in the 1970s in a way that transcends the specific substrate of biological or-ganisms: any system characterized by random variation of its attributes, a correlation between those attributes and whatever measure of fitness applies, and a mechanism of inheritance of the fitness-related attributes across genera-tions must evolve according to Darwin- ian principles. That is, the modality of Darwinian evolution is stronger than the one imposed by more contingent biological facts (such as that the genetic material of earthly organisms happens to be a type of nucleic acid). The idea that Lange develops in his paper, then, is that there are different degrees of modality that we can use to understand why some things are pos-sible and others impossible. That is, \"possibility\" and \"impossibility\" need to be qualified: something can be mathe-matically possible but physically impos-sible because the laws of physics of our universe just happen not to be struc-tured in a causally conducive way. But if something is mathematically, or logi-cally, impossible, then no set of physical laws could make it possible (i.e., math-ematical and logical impossibilities are stronger than physical ones). So, the next time we tell a purveyor of pseudoscientific notions that what he is proposing is \"impossible,\" we would be well served by specifying which type of impossibility we are referring to. The higher we can reasonably go along Lange's sliding scale of modality, the more confident we can be of the impos-sibility of the extranormal phenomenon in question. Conversely, we need to be careful about throwing the word impos-sible around too casually, since it may turn out that a given phenomenon is merely contingently not true but doesn't rise to the lofty metaphysical level of being impossible.

His website is at www.massimopolidoro.com. The Mystery of the Sicilian Avengers In eighteenth-century Sicily, there once was a group of mysterious men. By day, they would care for their businesses, but at night they would transform into a terrible sect, avengers of injustice and rectifiers of wrongs. Aristocratic and wealthy, they would protect the poor commoners and bring oppressors and tyrants to justice. They would wear black hoods and their identities were a mystery, even to each other. Their meeting point was in a place called \"Cuncuma,\" an under-ground grotto in Palermo, where caves and tunnels could lead their vengeance everywhere it was needed. They were known as the Beati Paoli (\"Blessed Pauls\"), and whoever was found guilty of some infraction would tremble upon hearing their name. The 'Sacred' Novel These are, broadly speaking, the char-acteristics of the legendary sect of the Beati Paoli. It was a long history handed down in Sicily and told only orally until it was published in the form of a serialized novel in 1909. The author of the novel was Luigi Natoli, who signed with the pseudonym of William Galt and told the story in 239 episodes published daily by the Giornale di Sicilia. Even before then, the story was told and repeated with such passion and care by the Sicilians that it became widely known among both the poor and the bourgeoisie. For the inhabitants of the Capo\u2014the Palermo district where it was believed the sect would meet\u2014Na- toli's novel became almost a sacred text, read aloud every evening by the head of the family for relatives who listened to it in rapt silence. According to the historian Rosario La Duca: \"In Sicily, the Beati Paoli is still the only book that a lot of ordinary people ever read in the course of their life.\" Yet very few out- side Sicily have ever heard of it. But, above all, it is reasonable to ask whether the history of the Beati Paoli is just a legend or has any real historical basis. A Sect of the Wicked A historian of ancient Palermo, Fran-cesco Maria Emanuele Gaetani, Marquis of Villabianca, who lived at the end of the eighteenth century, was the first to discuss the Beati Paoli in writing. In his Opuscoli palermitani , the first text to mention the sect, he explains how in his days the Beati Paoli \"were already a lost seed.\" That is, no one remembered them. It was Gaetani who reconstructed their story, calling them first and fore-most a \"sect of wicked and capricious people called avengers\" and tracing their origins back to 1185. From the Middle Ages, the sect would be contin-ually renewed up until one of the most turbulent periods in the history of Sic-ily, the one that in Natoli's novel spans from 1698 to 1719. It was an age of great contrasts, shaken by years of war and strong dis-agreements between church and state. Suffice it to say that during those twenty years, Sicily saw a succession of three monarchies. First the Span-ish, with the accession to the throne of Philip V, the first Bourbon king of Spain, then with Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy, and finally with the Austrian Charles VI of Habsburg. In this climate, it was inevitable that the noble and powerful abused their powers at the expense of the weakest. The Justice of the State, where it was not absent altogether, was almost al-ways at the service of the strongest; in addition, the same nobles often made use of thugs to quickly resolve those cases that they preferred not to subject even to the courts. Here, then, according to Gaetani, the reason that gave birth to the Beati Paoli: \"Poor people, not being able to A portrait of Luigi Natoli by F. Camarda, 1934. Photo Credit: photos from the blog of Tommaso Aiello (http://tommasoaiello.com)18 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirerpay for a killer, summoned the pride to do wickedly for themselves with their own hands.\" It was not simply a form of personal justice but was managed by a body acting in the shadows and, therefore, by its nature elusive and in turn powerful. Ancestors of the Mafia? For the masses, the Beati Paoli were heroes and defenders of the oppressed, and Natoli paints them as such in his novel. Others, however, such as the nineteenth-century journalist Vincent Linares, considered them \"wicked kill-ers\" who often acted for personal ven-dettas or to perform other common crimes. Also, according to Linares, the sect was eventually vanquished and scattered. There are those who want to see a link between the Beati Paoli and the modern mafia, seen here as a secret society. During a deposition, Mob re-pentant Tommaso Buscetta, a great ad-mirer of Natoli's book, declared: \"The mafia was not born today, it comes from the past. First there were the Beati Paoli, struggling with the poor against the rich...we have the same oath, the same duties.\" Another \"pentito,\" To-tuccio Contorno, called himself \"Co - just as the hero of Natoli's novel did.After the murder of Police Lieu- tenant Joe Petrosino, the enemy of Italian crime transplanted in the United States, who was killed in Palermo on March 12, 1909, the investigation brought to light that the mafia killers, responsible for the death of the Ital-ian-American policeman, not only had already appropriated the myth of the Beati Paoli but had started to meet in a basement, just like in the legend of the ancient cult. But this is just \"embezzlement,\" ac- cording to historians. \"The Mafia\" says La Duca, \"has its roots in the disinte-gration of the agrarian feudal structure of the island, which took place in the early nineteenth century, by which time the sect of the Beati Paoli had long gone.\" Natoli's book, therefore, would have unwittingly contributed to the apologetic feelings for the mafia. \"The citizen of Palermo,\" says the scholar Francesco Paolo Castiglione, \"is cer-tain that in an unspecified age\u2014as is always the case with historical refer-ences among common people\u2014the op - pressed had reached a precise awareness of their rights and were able to avenge the violence that they were forced to suffer. But clear indications show that, as long as the novelists did not start to build fanciful tales about literary Beati Paoli, the sect was not as mysterious as it was later considered, being suf- ficiently known both the character of political-military faction and the era in which it acted.\" The Extant Secret Lair Was it ever known who the Beati Paoli really were and where exactly they gathered? In his essay, Gaetani iden-tifies only three members of the sect. About the first, Giuseppe Amatore, we only know that he was a \"master scopettiere,\" that is a manufacturer of rifles, that he was called \"u Russu\" (the Red one) and that he was hanged in Palermo on December 17, 1704, at the age of twenty-seven. The second, Girolamo Ammirata, \"rational by pro-fession\" (an accountant), was hanged on the Piazza del Carmine in 1723 for killing a man \"with a stroke of carrubina.\" Regarding the third one, Gaetani tells us that he had been able to meet him in person. He was a famous coach driver in Palermo, Vito Vituzzu, that Gaetani knew as a child and last ruffian of the Compagnia de' Beati Paoli.\" Once he escaped the gallows, and with the cult dissolved, he was reduced to be the \"church farmer,\" i.e., the sacristan, at St. Matteo al Cas-saro. As for the cave of their mysterious get-togethers, it was called the Cun-cuma because in dialect \"keep con-c\u00f9miu\" means \"take counsel together, conspire.\" Natoli describes the lair: \"It was a sort of cave, dug into the tuff, with a circular dome on top; in the middle of the room there was a stone table; the man who gave orders would sit behind the table, his black hood was large and fully closed as the hooded brethren and would reach down to the middle of his chest.\" According to Gaetani, the meeting place of the Beati Paoli was identified in an underground cavity in the neigh-borhood of the Capo, near the church of S. Mary of Jesus. Accessible through it, Gaetani wrote, was the home of the Backboard of a Sicilian cart illustrating two episodes from the Beati Paoli stories.Photo Credit: photos the blog Inquirer | July/August 2013 19 MASSIMO POLIDORO A S TRANGE WO RLD] lawyer Giovanbattista Baldi: \"From the first floor of the entrance of the house, through a door, you arrive in a small open court in which there is a low tree, and the floor on which you walk is nothing else than the layer covering the cave below. In the center of the vault is an eye with an iron grate that serves as a crack and gives light to the underground cave.\" It then went down five stone steps and there you were in a room that overlooked the main cave, complete with seats carved into the rock and shelves \"in which they placed their iron firearms.\" The existence of this cave was con- firmed in the late nineteenth century by the visit of a Palermo scholar, Vincenzo Di Giovanni, who found it, stating that in 1889 it was possible to access it through \"the house of Baron Biandano in the Via Beati Paoli at no. 35.\" Today the Cuncuma is no longer accessible because the inputs were walled up, but after his visit Di Giovanni had a marble plaque put up on the building facade, which, in order to avoid any possible doubt, read: \"The old headquarters of the Beati Paoli.\" Caves and tunnels, in fact, are well known in the area and are part of a Christian cemetery complex developed in the fourth century , the natural bed of the river Papireto. \"But popular imagination,\" says La Duca, who is also an expert on the topography of Pal-ermo, \"believed and still believes that each cavity present in the underground of the city or his neighbor's territory has been used by members of the secret society. The most unthinkable legends have then emerged and find a justifiable support in the presence, in the north-western area of the vast territory of Pal-ermo, of stone quarries in tunnels that are mostly empty and make the subsoil viable.\" Myth and Reality The story of the Beati Paoli inevitably moves between myth and reality. The same name of the sect, whose origins are not clear, is an example in itself. Giuseppe Pitr\u00e8, a nineteenth-century anthropologist who lived in Palermo, wrote: \"Particularly lucky were consid-ered those born on the night of St. Paul ( June 29-30), as it was widely believed that they possessed supernatural virtues not shared by any other mortal. They are strong and prosperous, can handle snakes, vipers, and venomous reptiles of all kinds with impunity . . . can face the werewolves . . . know how to predict the future and are considered infallible oracles. It is likely, then, that since they were considered almost supernatural incarnations of the Apostle Paul, they gave the name to the sect of the Beati Paoli, whose members were also con-sidered supernatural beings, both for the aura of mystery that surrounded them and the secrecy of their actions.\" True or false, the Beati Paoli also en- tered common language. And if \"having as much as the Beati Paoli\" once meant to take a lot of beating, today in Sicily the phrase is another way of saying that one is a survivor. It seems, in fact, that during the day, the Beati Paoli went into churches pretending to pray the Rosary dressed as monks of St. Fran-cesco di Paola (another possible origin for the name). It was actually a ploy in order to better learn the facts that hap-pened in the town, and then, at night, they would plot and implement their revenges based on what they had heard. That is why, even today, in order to indicate a dangerous person who only appears to be good on the surface, you can hear in Palermo and the surround-ing area the people say: \"He is just like a Beato Paolo.\" I Acknowledgment Many thanks to Fara Di Maio for helping in the research of material in the archives of Palermo.

Sheaffer blogs at www.BadUFOs.com, and his website is www.debunker.com.[ PSYC HIC VIBRATIO NS ROBERT SHEAFFER UFOs in the Desert, 2013 For the second year in a row, I attended the International UFO Congress near Phoenix, Arizona, the largest UFO conference in the world. What follows are some of the highlights of the conference. A much longer, five-part version of this report can be found on my blog at www.BadUFOs.com. Ben Hansen, host of the Fact or Faked show on the SyFy Channel, spoke on \"Profiling the Hoaxers.\" He explained that his background in law enforcement prepared him well for evaluating forensic evidence of UFOs and other \"paranormal\" evidence. He describes himself as neither a believer nor a skeptic but a \"verifier.\" He ex - plains that hoaxes abound in UFOl-ogy, and that there can be big money in making bogus ET claims, although he refused to name any names. He set forth several \"Hoaxer Subtypes,\" in-cluding the charismatic Clinical Con Artist; Legendizers who seek fame and/or financial gain; Commercial Campaigners with publicity stunts; Self-Amused Pranksters motivated by the challenge of pulling it off; and Dis-information Agents\u2014the rarest type and a category that sounds rather du-bious to me. Claims of persecution by federal agencies is a red flag of a charismatic hoaxer. When a story or a video is crafted to capture emotion, this is a sign of a hoax. You have to think like a movie director: if the crafting of a video appears to be planned out to demon -strate credibility, the video is dubious since a real UFO video would be taken without preparation or warning. Also, certain technical errors in the creation of a video reveal a hoax. Bigfoot videos tend to show the creature moving left-to-right much more than the opposite. Either Bigfoot walks in circles, or else it is staged to look this way. But Han-sen believes that some Bigfoot sightings are valid, as he believes are some UFO sightings. Stanley Milford and John Dover, who are current and retired (respec-tively) law enforcement for the Na-vajo Nation, spoke on \"UFOs Over Native American Land\" (the Congress itself takes place on an Indian reserva-tion). These two officers headed up the Rangers' Special Projects Unit, which \"managed the investigation of those cases that would be deemed 'paranor-mal,' such as witchcraft, Bigfoot sight-ings, hauntings, and UFO sightings,\" although these are only about one to two percent of the cases of Special Proj-ects. In one incident, an elderly Navajo claimed that a brilliantly illuminated UFO circled his remote desert house. He then saw, looking out the window, four aliens walking around with flash-lights. The Rangers also received re-ports of Bigfoot sightings and tracks, witchcraft, and Shapeshifters (similar to werewolves). Such beliefs, they ex - plained, are prevalent on the reserva - tion. Grant Cameron, who has been ac- tive in UFO and paranormal research for almost forty years, spoke on \"Con-sciousness and UFOs.\" He is convinced that no real progress in knowledge about UFOs will be made until we suc-cessfully contact the beings involved. Cameron's argument is basically that if you can show that the idea of mental contact with UFOs predates the earli-est contactee, George Adamski, then you have shown that it is not deriva-tive from that case. This argument is quite correct, even ingenious. But the problem is that even then you still ha-ven't proven that the \"contact\" is real; all you've proven is that Adamski wasn't the first to make it up. Micah Hanks, an author and re- searcher, talked about \"The UFO Singu larity.\" As our machines' artificial Skeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 21intelligence continues to increase, fu- turists speculate that for precisely one moment of time their intelligence will equal ours\u2014and then forever afterward, theirs will be greater. This, of course, has nothing to do with UFOs. Or does it? Hanks suggests that UFOs may rep-resent a \"post-singularity technology,\" probably originating here on Earth, that somehow \"transcends temporality.\" The venerable Leo Sprinkle, psy- chologist and pioneering UFO abduc-tionist, spoke on \"Memories of an ET Experiencer and Spiritual Pigtailer.\" Sprinkle has been hypnotically regress-ing supposed ET experiencers for over forty years and still looks vigorous and spry at age eighty-two. Only in recent years did Sprinkle reveal that he be-lieves he is an ET experiencer himself. He also talked about reincarnation and his past lives. The panel \"Investigating UFOs\" featured James Fox, Nick Pope, and Marc Dantonio and was hosted by Lee Speigel. If you have been reading Spei-gel's articles in The Huffington Post, you know that he has been receiving many purported UFO photos and videos, and he has been sending them to Dan-tonio for analysis. Marc Dantonio is MUFON's chief photo/video analyst and president of FX Models, a mod-el-making and special effects company. Because he is an expert in special ef-fects, it would be extremely difficult for a hoaxer to fool him. While Dantonio believes that some UFO cases are au-thentic, he is actually very skeptical of photos and videos. \"We must remove all of the possible 'knowns,'\" he said, and if it's a close correlation to some-thing we already know, he concludes it is that. Then he said something that amazed me: \"Lee, you haven't yet given me anything 'unknown.'\" He says, \"I am harsh on the data.\" Even when a wit-ness insists \"I know what I saw!\" Dan-tonio tells them that his comments are directed toward the data\u2014the photo or video\u2014not toward what they saw. Later in his own talk, Dantonio showed photos and videos that depict lens flares, aircraft operation, solar bal-loons, the blinking lights on a vehicle, a reflection on a windshield, blowing snow, a flock of geese, digital skywrit-ing, a butterfly, and views of a tower from Google Earth. \"The purpose is not primarily to debunk the footage but to illustrate that we must be very hard on the data in order to find the holy grail of UFOlogy.\" Amen, brother! But the reason he is not a total skep-tic, he explained, is that about fifteen years ago he had a traumatic encounter event in which he awoke at night, par- alyzed, and was menaced by terrifying creatures. Dantonio appears not to be familiar with the well-known phenom-enon of sleep disorders known as hyp-nagogic and hypnopompic hallucina-tions, which account for a large number of \"alien abduction\" reports. Roger Leir and Steven Colbern on \"Alien Implants: The Tip of the Iceberg.\" Leir has performed sixteen surgeries to remove implants from alleged alien abductees. He says his Alien & Scalpel Research (A&S) is incorporated as a 501(c)(3) company, and does not charge for any of the sur-geries. During his fifteenth surgery Leir says that the implant kept moving away from the scalpel. It broke into twelve pieces and one disappeared. Two days after removal, the remaining pieces re-assembled themselves. A&S went to the man's house in full Ghost Hunter mode, with radio frequency scanners, magnetometers, and radiation detec-tors. Many anomalies were discovered, including a magnetic monopole (some-thing sought more eagerly even than unicorns), and magnetized wood and plastic. However, the man's wife was in a \"constant state of denial\" about all this alien activity. Steve Colbern talked about the supposed alien implant re-moved during that surgery. It is sim-ilar in appearance to a meteorite and consists of carbon fiber nanotubes, a manufactured nanotechnology device of unknown purpose. Thirty-two trace elements were detected, including irid-ium, and meteoric iron. One magnetic pole of the object is stronger than the other (which I think makes it a mag-netic monopole, as well). On Friday evening there was a free skywatch hosted by Ben Hansen and sponsored by Night Optics USA, a Bushnell company. Their hope was to sell some very expensive night-vision equipment to UFO enthusiasts. People stood in line for their turn to personally look through the different night-vision devices. Meanwhile UFO skeptic James McGaha and I had brought our porta-ble telescopes and offered views of Jupi-ter, the Pleiades, and the Orion nebula. On the big screen, a satellite or some-thing was briefly noted, but nothing of UFOlogical significance was seen all night. While Dantonio believes that some UFO cases are authentic, he is actually very skeptical of photos and videos. \"We must remove all of the possible 'knowns,'\" he said, and if it's a close correlation to something we already know, he concludes it is that.22 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical InquirerJohn Rao, the founder of Open Minds (sponsor of the UFO Con- gress) drove his UFO spotting vehicle to the evening skywatch. This ATV has been customized with dual cam-eras in the back. However, these are not astronomical cameras but instead are security cameras like those used by the Border Patrol to look for illegal border crossers; they do not have the resolution that is typical of astronom-ical cameras. The cameras picked up a round object that Rao suggested was an \"orb.\" It slowly drifted from left to right across the screen, and he would repeat- edly move it back to the left side again. It was obviously an out-of-focus star image, moving from east to west be-cause the camera does not have celestial tracking to compensate for the rotation of Earth. I had a green laser pointer, and laid it against the edge of the cam-era. The beam pointed exactly to Ep-silon Canis Majoris (Adhara), a star of magnitude 1.5 (brighter than the stars in the Big Dipper) due south about 25 degrees up. This was the orb. McGaha came by and figured out how to focus the image. When that was done, the \"orb\" shrank down to a pinpoint size. Ben McGee spoke on \"Galactic Deep Time, Xenoarchaeology, and the case for Physical Artifacts as 'First Con-tact.'\" He is best known as the skeptic guy on National Geographic Channel's dreadful Chasing UFOs, which, I am happy to report, will not be renewed for another season. He has a spaceflight consulting company. McGee described the history of life on Earth in terms of \"galactic years,\" the time required for one full rotation of our galaxy (220 million years). Hence \"deep time\" is important to think about in terms of the prevalence of ETI. Earth has had five major extinction events in the last 2.5 galactic years, and two within the last galactic year. So how long would a civilization last in our galaxy? If dras-tic extinction events are common, then an estimated 325 million planets would contain not an actual civilization but the ruins of one. Hence, xenoarchaeology, the study of artifacts from extraterres-trial civilizations, which would require different methods than conventional archaeology. The documentary film director James Fox, who was also on Chasing UFOs as \"the believer\" to Ben's \"skep-tic,\" described his work as a UFO documentary film producer (Out of the Blue, I Know What I Saw) as promot - ing the fulfillment of the public's \"right to know\" what is going on. Fox spent a great deal of time talking about and illustrating the news coverage that he has received, and he showed some ex-amples of his \"gorilla marketing\" of his films (I suspect he meant \"guerilla\"). Fox explained that he had arranged to interview Buzz Aldrin about the UFOs that supposedly followed him to the moon, but Aldrin backed out at the last minute because he feared losing fund-ing from Paul Allen for SETI. Fox an-nounced that his next UFO documen-tary project was under way: 701\u2014The Movie. This, he says, is the number that the government does not want you to know\u2014the number of Project Blue Book \"unknowns.\" What Fox does not realize is that this number has already shrunk upon further analysis and is set to shrink still further (see Tim Printy's Sunlite at tinyurl.com/bqqp5py). Of course there was the inevita- ble talk by Stanton T. Friedman, who promised \"A New Look at the Cos-mos,\" although very little in his talk was new. He began talking about scientific mistakes of the past. To Friedman, rejecting UFOs is another of science's great mistakes. He presented the equa-tions of fusion, without working out the actual results of those equations as did Edward M. Purcell, proving that interstellar travel using nuclear fusion is preposterous. He termed SETI the \"silly effort to investigate.\" After all, why look all across the cosmos for ETI when they're here right now? People say that if the government had UFO secrets, they would have leaked out by now. Friedman claims that governments can keep secrets, and for his example he cites the Corona spy satellite program of the early 1960s, that supposedly was unknown until it was declassified in 1995. BZZZZT\u2014wrong answer! In 1971, Friedman's good buddy UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass, drawing upon what he learned in his work as senior avionics editor at Aviation Week magazine, wrote Se- cret Sentries in Space (Random House), which contains a detailed description of the then top-secret classified Corona program, explaining exactly what it is and how it works. Klass always insisted that if there were any government se - Fox explained that he had arranged to interview Buzz Aldrin about the UFOs that supposedly followed him to the moon, but Aldrin backed out at the last minute because he feared losing funding from Paul Allen for SETI.[PSY CHIC VIBRA TIO NS ROBERT SHEAFFERSkeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 23crets about UFOs, he would have picked up on them long ago through his extensive network of sources. Fried-man says that at least three out of over 100 supposedly leaked MJ-12 govern-ment UFO documents are authentic, meaning he concedes that some en-ergetic hoaxer has produced the other 97 percent. I say it's 100 percent. We almost agree. Interestingly, Friedman did not mention the Fish Map (a supposed extraterrestrial star map sketched by Betty Hill), but did go on about Zeta1 and Zeta2 Reticuli, the supposed home stars of the UFOnauts, according to that map. For reasons that make no sense, he still clings to Zeta1 and Zeta2 as the alleged home stars of the UFOn-auts. Once you concede that the Fish Map pattern means nothing, then the Zetas mean nothing as well. Still, per-haps we should applaud Friedman for having taken baby steps in the direction of truth. The talk by Alain Boudier was po- tentially the most significant and news-worthy of the entire Congress. Boudier said that his Aeronautical & Astro-nomical Association of France (3AF) is the most prestigious organization of its kind. It is not a government body but equivalent to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA, which had its own flirtation with UFOs over forty years ago, and thankfully not since). The UFO report of the 3AF Sigma Commission is set to be released in a few months. This report, he prom-ised, will be different than the \"official\" history of UFOs. It appears that the in-tent of the report is to push the entire UFO chronology back, before Arnold, to include the World War II-era. He talked about foo fighters, the Battle of Los Angeles, and some pre-Arnold sightings in the Pacific before mov-ing on to Roswell, which he accepts as a genuine alien crash. The report's conclusions were that the U.S. mili-tary made its first UFO crash retrievals in 1941 (by the Navy, off the coast of San Diego), and on February 26, 1942 (by the Army, in the San Bernardino Mountains). Supposedly a document from FDR mentions the retrievals. The U.S. formed an \"Interplanetary Phe-nomena Unit\" to manage these retriev-als. This allowed the development of otherwise-unknown technology, which he suggested was used to defeat Japan. You heard it right, folks: reverse-en-gineered alien technology was used to build the atomic bomb. I For details, visit www.gse.buffalo.edu/online/science Questions?

A New Proposal The persistence of homosexuality among certain animal species, including humans, has bewildered scientists at least since the time of Darwin. Why should same-sex attrac-tion persist when evolution assumes reproductive success? Does homosex-uality\u2014especially among humans\u2014facilitate the intergenerational transfer of genetic material in some other way? Or perhaps it advances an entirely dif-ferent objective that justifies its more obvious procreative disadvantage. Such questions have long attracted gene-based explanations.Consider \"kin selection,\" for exam- ple. As E.O. Wilson first suggested in 1975, maybe human homosexuals are like sterile female worker bees that assist the queen in reproduction. One study of homosexual men, known in In-dependent Samoa as fa'afafine, revealed that gays are significantly more likely than straight men to help their siblings raise children. But statistical significance isn't the standard here. To satisfy the kin se-lection hypothesis, each gay must ac-count for the survival of at least two sibling-born children for every one he fails to reproduce\u2014no doubt, a difficult benchmark to attain. In any event, rel-evant studies in the United States and United Kingdom have so far failed to provide such evidence. As a possible explanation for male homosexuality, other researchers have offered the \"fertile female\" hypothe-sis. Here, a genetic tendency toward androphilia, or attraction to males\u2014though problematic for men from an evolutionary perspective\u2014is thought to enhance the reproductive success of their straight, opposite-sex relatives by rendering them hypersexual. At least two studies have claimed results in support of the fertile female model, which some researchers find ap-pealing for a second reason. It is also ca-pable of explaining why homosexuality persists at a constant but low frequency of no more than 8 percent in the general global population.A former faculty member at Harvard Medical and the Salk Institute, British neuroscientist Simon LeVay favors in-stead evidence suggesting a suite of sev-eral \"feminizing\" genes (LeVay 2011). The inheritance of a limited number of these genes, LeVay suggests, will make males, for instance, more attractive to females\u2014and thus presumably more successful in terms of reproduction\u2014by rendering them less aggressive and more empathetic, for example. But nature makes mistakes, of course. A few men in the family tree will inevitably receive \"too many\" fem-inizing genes and, as a result, be born gay. Indeed, one Australian study dis-covered that gender-atypical traits do tend to enhance reproduction. In this sample, heterosexuals with homosexual twins claimed to achieve more oppo-site-sex partnerships than heterosexuals without homosexual twins\u2014though statistical significance was observed only among females. Even so, most contemporary expla- nations are not based solely in genetics. Evidence suggests as well, for example, that a variety of mental gender traits are shaped during fetal life by varying levels of circulating sex hormones. Es - pecially during certain critical periods of development, testosterone (T) levels in particular are thought to cause the brain to organize in a more masculine or feminine direction and, later in life, to influence a broad spectrum of gender traits, including sexual preference.For instance, women suffering from congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to elevated levels of prenatal T and other androgens are known to possess gender traits significantly shifted to-ward masculinity, including lesbianism. Importantly, female fetuses most se-verely affected by CAH and, thus, most heavily exposed to prenatal androgens are the most likely to experience same-sex attraction later in life. Similarly, the bodies of male fetuses afflicted with androgen insensitivity syndrome\u2014a condition in which the gene coding for the androgen receptor has mutated\u2014fail to react normally to circulating T. As a result, these XY fetuses will later appear as girls and, as adults, share an attraction to men. To summarize, although a number of other factors could be, and likely are, at play, it is now fairly well established that pre-natal androgen levels have a substantial impact on sexual orientation in both men and women. But three researchers working through the National Institute for Math-ematical and Biological Synthesis have recently combined evolutionary theory with the rapidly advancing science of both androgen-dependent sexual devel-opment and molecular regulation of gene expression to propose a new and provoc-ative epigenetic model to explain both male and female homosexuality (Rice et al. 2012). According to lead author William Rice at the University of California, Santa Barbara, his group's hypothesis succeeds not only in squaring homosex-uality with natural selection but also ex-plains why same-sex attraction has been proven substantially heritable despite two powerful and confounding facts. One, numerous molecular studies have so far failed to locate associated DNA markers and, two, concordance between identical twins\u2014about twenty percent\u2014is far lower than genetic causation might predict. At the new model's heart are sex-specific epigenetic modifications, or epi-marks. Generally speaking, epi- marks can be characterized as molecu-lar regulatory switches attached to the backbones of genes that direct how, when, and to what degree genetic in-structions are carried out during an or-ganism's development. They are created anew during each generation and are almost always \"erased\" between gener-ations. But because epi-marks are produced at the embryonic stem cell stage of de-velopment\u2014prior to division between soma and germline\u2014they can, in the - ory, be transmitted across generations. Indeed, some empirical evidence does suggest that on rare occasions (though not at scientifically trivial rates) they will indeed carry over and thus mimic the hereditary effect of genes. Under typical circumstances, Rice instructs, sex-specific epi-marks serve our species' evolutionary objectives quite well by canalizing subsequent sexual development. In other words, they protect sexually essential develop-mental endpoints by buffering XX fe-tuses from the masculinizing effects and XY fetuses from the feminizing effects of fluctuating in utero androgen levels. Significantly, each epi-mark will influ-ence some sexually dimorphic traits\u2014sexual orientation, for example\u2014but not others. According to the group's model, however, when sex-specific epi-marks manage to escape intergenerational erasure and transfer to opposite-sex offspring, they become sexually antag-onistic (SA) and thus capable of guiding the development of sexual phenotypes in a gonad-discordant direction. As such, Rice hypothesizes, \"homosexu-ality occurs when stronger-than-aver- age SA-epi-marks (influencing sexual preference) from an opposite-sex par-ent escape erasure and are then paired with weaker-than-average de novo sex-specific epi-marks produced in op-posite-sex offspring.\" To summarize, Rice's team argues that differences in the sensitivity of XY and XX fetuses to the same levels of T might be caused by epigenetic mech-anisms. Normally, such mechanisms would render male fetuses compara-tively more sensitive and female fetuses relatively less sensitive to exposure. But if such epigenetic labels pass between generations, they can influence the progeny's sexual development as well. And if they pass from mother to son or from father to daughter, sexual de-velopment can proceed in an atypical manner. In those very exceptional cases, offspring brain development can prog - Skeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 25Although a number of other factors could be, and likely are, at play, it is now fairly well established that prenatal androgen levels have a substantial impact on sexual orientation in both men and women.ress in a fashion more likely to result in homosexuality. Rice's observations and insights are fascinating, to say the least. Indeed, popular news reports have described a scientific community highly appre-ciative of the new model's theoretical power. But of course a great deal of criticism has been tendered as well. LeVay, for example, describes the authors' hypothesis generally as \"a rea-sonable one that deserves to be tested\u2014for example by actual measurement of the epigenetic labeling of relevant genes in gay people and their parents.\" Nevertheless, the new model is in fact \"pure speculation,\" LeVay told me, and it never should have been reported\u2014as some media have done\u2014so grandiosely as \"the cause\" as \"a cause\") of homosexuality. More specifically, LeVay offers three points of caution. First, he warns that an epigenetic explanation is not to any degree implied from the current data on fetal T levels. When based on single measurements, he concedes, male and female fetuses may indeed show some overlap. But because T levels fluctuate throughout development in both males and females, allegedly anomalous indi-viduals might easily average completely sex-typical T levels over time. Second, LeVay sees \"little or no ev- idence\" that epi-marks ever escape era-sure in humans. Finally, LeVay continues to favor genetic explanations. The incidence of homosexuality in some family trees, he says, is more consistent with DNA in-heritance than with any known epigen-etic mechanism. Moreover, he warns, we should never underestimate the difficulty of identifying genetic influ-ences\u2014especially with regard to mental traits. In such cases, complex polygenic origins are far more likely to be at play than any single, magic genetic bullet. Other neuroscientists have posed equally important questions. How can we test whether the appropri-ate epi-marks\u2014probably situated in the brain\u2014have been erased? Is it too simplistic to suggest identical or even similar mechanisms for both male and female homosexuality? Why is it im-portant to isolate the specific biological causes of same-sex attraction? By doing so, do we run the risk of further stig-matizing an already beleaguered popu-lation? Rice doesn't deny his new model's data deficit. Nor does he portray the epigenetic influence on same-sex at-traction as an exclusive one. His team does, however, insist that epigenetics is \"a probable agent contributing to ho-mosexuality.\" We now have \"clear evi-dence,\" they maintain, that \"epigenetic changes to gene promoters . . . can be transmitted across generations and . . . can strongly influence, in the next gen-eration, both sex-specific behavior and gene expression in the brain.\" The authors contend as well that their hypothesis can be rapidly falsified because it makes \"two unambiguous predictions that are testable with cur-rent technology.\" Prediction one: Fu-ture large-scale association studies will not identify genetic markers correlated with most homosexuality. Any such as-sociations found, they say, will be weak. Prediction two: Future genome-wide epigenetic profiles will distinguish dif - ferences between homosexuals and non-homosexuals, but only at genes associated with androgen signaling or in brain regions controlling sexual orientation. Testing this second pre - diction, they confess, can proceed only with regard to lesbianism by comparing profiles of sperm from fathers with and without homosexual daughters. To my knowledge, Rice and his col- leagues have never squarely addressed the question of whether, for philosoph-ical or sociological reasons, we should refrain from delving further into the dicey subject of same-sex attraction. Negative responses, I would argue, ex-pose both a tendency toward communal repression of individual thought and a fundamental disrespect for the scien - tific enterprise. Such decisions should always be left to the scientists and those who fund them. After all, it was sci-ence\u2014not social concern\u2014that con-firmed the predominance of biology as the basis of homosexuality in the first place. I References LeVay, Simon. 2011.

What happened, and how did the people of Chelyabinsk react? DAVID MORRISO N, ALAN HARRIS, and MAR K BO SLOUGH Shortly after sunrise on February 15, a projectile entered the atmosphere over the Ural Mountains travelling at more than eighteen kilo - meters per second. It was about twenty meters (sixty feet) in diameter, or half the diameter of the famous Tunguska impact of 1908, which flattened a thou-sand square miles of Siberian forest. The rocky projectile, which came from the asteroid belt, left a trail of smoky condensation across the sky as it vapor- ized in the atmosphere. Its terminal ex-plosion, at an altitude of twenty-three kilometers, released energy equivalent to a couple dozen Hiroshima-sized atom bombs. When it exploded, the bo-lide (a very bright meteor that explodes in the atmosphere) was for a few sec-onds brighter than the sun. About two minutes later the shock wave reached the ground in Chelyabinsk, breaking windows and injuring about 1,500 peo-ple from flying glass and other debris. There was no advance warning of this asteroid strike. With a diameter of twenty meters (twenty meters is the best current estimate of the diameter, based on the mass that would produce the ~0.5 MT energy of the bolide), the Chelyabinsk impactor was smaller than most asteroids that have been de-tected by the telescopes of the NASA Xinhua News AgencySpaceguard Survey, which focuses on finding asteroids of about one hundred meters or larger. Furthermore, since it approached Earth from very near the direction of the sun, it could not have been seen by a ground-based op-tical telescope of any size. It therefore struck without warning, although the atmospheric explosion was measured by down-looking surveillance satellites. The Chelyabinsk bolide had about a tenth of the energy, and exploded more than twice as high, as Tunguska. The blast energy was directed more sideways that downward. These factors resulted, thankfully, in much less damage on the ground. The explosion also produced a shower of stony meteorites, of a type common among the asteroids (ordinary chondrite). These meteorites, distrib-uted over an impact region more than one hundred kilometers long, were easily collected by local people because most fell on snow, leaving obvious little \"entry wounds.\" Perhaps most surprising is what did not happen: There was no panic reac-tion that this was a nuclear attack. As far back as 1981, geologist Gene Shoe- maker and others had warned that an unexpected cosmic impact might be misinterpreted as an attack and trigger a nuclear exchange. This fear has hovered over all subsequent studies of the impact hazard. Perhaps it was a legitimate con-cern during the Cold War, and maybe this is still a danger if a cosmic impact took place over the disputed territory of nuclear-armed antagonists such as India and Pakistan. Chelyabinsk is near the heart of the Soviet defense industry, surrounded by facilities that design and build nuclear weapons and rocket deliv-ery systems. Those with long memories may remember that this area was the target of the 1960 U-2 flight of Gary Powers that was shot down by a Soviet missile. Yet apparently neither the Rus-sian military nor the public associated the event of February 15 with a nuclear attack. For this we can all breathe eas- ier. The people of Chelyabinsk initially did not know what hit their city. Vid- eos show that the brilliant light pass- ing across the sky was ignored by most people, with traffic flow unaffected. We would have expected drivers to pull to the side of the road and get out to look at the trail of the bolide stretching across the sky, but this is not what the videos show. When the shock wave hit it was unexpected. Many people were injured because they went to the win-dows to see what was happening. In at least one case a teacher initially told her students to \"duck and cover,\" the old Cold War-drill. They hid under their desks, but when nothing happened they got up and went to the window just in time for the shock wave. Photos of the damage showed that in many office and apartment buildings, only a few 28 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirer Nikulin Vyacheslav Itar-Tass Photos/Newscom Perhaps most surprising is what did not happen: There was no panic reaction that this was a nuclear attack.The Chelyabinsk Event windows were blown out, while most remained intact. Many of the videos of the fireball posted on the Internet were taken from automatic auto dash-board cameras, or dashcams, installed by drivers in Russia to defend against insurance fraud or police corruption in case of an accident. The response from the scientific community was quick. Scientists have been studying the impact hazard for two decades, and they are well con- nected by the Internet. In addition, many residents of Chelyabinsk began posting YouTube videos within an hour after the event. Within a few hours, the cause of the explosion was identified as the stratospheric disinte-gration of an incoming rocky object. The initial Russian news reports spec-ulated that the asteroid was only a few meters in diameter and the energy was only a few tens of kilotons. However, the data from a worldwide network of atmospheric pressure sensors and seis-mic stations quickly established the energy of the explosion as between 300 and 500 kilotons. The response from the U.S. orbital monitoring system was also remarkably fast. Three days after the event they released the exact time and location, with measurements of the bolide track and its altitude (about 23 km) and velocity (more than 18 km/s) at peak brightness. Fortunately, there seem to have been few suggestions that this was an unnatural event such as a UFO, or the product of some secret weapons sys-tem. Such stories continue to circulate about Tunguska, even a century after it happened. For a couple of days there were claims that the object was a comet rather than an asteroid. In part these came from the misunderstanding that the white trail left by the impactor was made of water droplets analogous to an airplane contrail, rather than ablation from the rocky object. Also, for the past century many Russian scientists have persisted in claiming that the Tunguska impactor was a comet, even after most other scientists abandoned that idea in favor of a rocky asteroid. A curious aspect is the fact that Feb- ruary 15 was also the date of the clos-est passage by Earth of a 30-40 meter asteroid called 2012 DA14. It flew just 28,000 km above the Earth's surface. This remarkable coincidence seemed to call for an explanation, and many press stories suggested that the two ob-jects were traveling together in space or were somehow related. The question of whether a \"coincidence\" is the result of truly correlated events or just chance is a familiar theme to skeptics. Nature has provided us with several lines of evidence that the two events were not related. Immediately following the event, meteor expert Peter Brown of the University of Western Ontario checked radar meteor data to see if the Earth had experienced unusual meteor activity due to passage through a stream of debris associated with either 2012 DA14 or the Chelyabinsk bolide, and found none. Richard Binzel of MIT, who studies physical characteristics of asteroids, noted that the spectrum of 2012 DA14 implies a composition of the asteroid radically different from the composition of the recovered meteorites from the Chelyabinsk event. William Bottke of the Southwest Research Insti-tute in Boulder, an expert on the evolu-tion of asteroid orbits, noted that 2012 DA14's orbit is probably the result of numerous close encounters with Earth and other inner planets, whereas the orbit of the Chelyabinsk asteroid was a relatively \"fresh\" transfer orbit from the main belt. Last and perhaps most Skeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 29 Coauthor Mark Boslough (at right), visiting the lab of Prof. Viktor Grokhovsky at Ural Federal University in central Russia, displays one of the largest recovered pieces of the Chelyabinsk meteor explosion. Boslough, a noted impact physics expert from Sandia National Laboratories (and a CSI Fellow), flew to Chelyabinsk shortly after the bolide explosion and participated in a PBS NOVA documentary, \"Meteor Strike,\" about the historic event. It aired March 27, 2013, less than six weeks after the blast. Photo courtesy of Mark Boslough. Left photo, a resident cleans up some of the damage from the explosion. KRT/Newscom30 Volume 37 Issue 4 | SKEPTICAL INQUIRERcompelling, the direction of arrival of the two objects was radically different. 2012 DA14 approached Earth from an extremely southerly direction, and it would be impossible for another object in a similar orbit to hit Earth in the far northern hemisphere over Russia. The Chelyabinsk asteroid approached from the east. Humans are hardwired to see pat- terns and causal relationships, and when we witness such an unlikely co - incidence it can be hard to accept it as such. Within a few hours of the Rus-sian event, there was speculation on Facebook that NASA was at fault, that 2012 DA14 had undiscovered compan-ions, and that as the Earth rotated we could expect more impacts in Europe. To NASA's credit, this speculation was immediately countered in a February 15 early-morning press conference, in which Planetary Science Director Jim Green stated unequivocally that there was no connection. Unfortunately, the usual suspects are now accusing NASA of a cover-up. Blogs dedicated to bash-ing climate researchers and scientists who don't accept neocatastrophism now have another pseudoscientific conspir-acy theory to promote. We are left to ask just how unlikely is the coincidence of the two events hap-pening on the same day? Is the improb-ability of that coincidence sufficient to overwhelm the strong observational evidence that they are unrelated?

One can imagine three ways the question might be asked: (1) What is the chance that these two events would occur on a specific day, say Valentine's Day or some other specific \"predicted\" day, like the peak of a known meteor shower? (2) What is the chance that two such events would occur within a day of one another, on whatever day one or the other chanced to occur? (3) What is the chance that on the same day that one of these events occurred, say the Chely-abinsk bolide, another uncommon and newsworthy event also happened? Each of these probabilities can be estimated, and the numbers are radically different. The flyby of an asteroid like 2012 DA14 has about the same probability as the Chelyabinsk impact to within our uncertainties, which are at least a factor of two. An impact somewhere on Earth of an object the size of the Chelyabinsk projectile, like the pass of an asteroid of the size and at the distance of 2012 DA14, happens about once every cen-tury on average, or about once in 40,000 days, to one significant digit. If you start by selecting a specific date, like Febru-ary 15, 2013 (case 1 above), the chances of both events happening are extraor-dinarily small, one chance in 40,000 squared, or about one in a billion. But a more realistic question to ask is, as in case 2 above, given that one of the events, say the Chelyabinsk event, did happen, what is the chance of the other event, the 2012 DA14 flyby, occurring on the same day? The answer to that is, of course, just the chance of the other event on any given day, or 1 in 40,000. Even this estimate is highly \"framed\" by the specifics of the particular events. Suppose we asked what are the odds of a fifty meter diameter asteroid passing within 30,000 km of the Earth the same day, or of a 20 meter diameter asteroid passing within 15,000 km? The answers would be \"Who cares? They didn't.\" By sizing a \"box\" specifically to just include the events in question, we radically affect the apparent coincidence of the events. As a final example, consider case 3 above. Given one of the events, again take Chelyabinsk, we can ask, \"What is the chance of another newsworthy event of a kind that might plausibly be related, occurring on the same day?\" An event \"that might plausibly be related\" could include another actual impact, or the close fly-by of the Earth by an-other small asteroid, or perhaps a major earthquake. Looking ten or fifteen years into the past or future, there have been a number of real or imagined events. There was a very large bolide over In-donesia in 2009, a large meteorite that notoriously failed to break up and ac-tually hit the ground whole in Peru in 2007, and the asteroid 2008 TC3, that was discovered in space before it hit the Earth in October 2008. Although the 2012 DA14 close flyby is claimed to be roughly a once-per-century event, the much larger asteroid (99942) Apophis will make a similarly close flyby in only sixteen years, in 2029. Still other asteroids flew by that failed to make headlines be-cause they were discovered only after their close flybys, but presumably would have raised a question of correlation if they had occurred on the same day as another event. In the same time frame, we have experienced two of the most destructive earthquakes in history (Indian Ocean in 2004 and Japan in 2011). Thus some newsworthy event, such as an actual atmospheric entry, a close asteroid flyby, or a major earthquake, occurs every few years, say about once in a thousand days. So the answer to case 3 appears to be about one chance in a thousand that a second event, of a kind that could raise a question of cor-relation, might occur within a day of the event in question. The probability of the coincidence of the two events can range from one in a billion to one in a thousand, depend-ing on how we frame the question. It is noteworthy that no reasonable anal-ysis suggests that such a coincidence is \"expected\"; even one in a thousand is a rare event. But on any given day, one can make an advance list of many thousands of possible events, each of which has a one-in-a-thousand chance of happening. With that many chances, it is virtually certain that some of them will occur. So raising the question of correlation is not frivolous, but the odds are not so rare as to seek extreme expla-nations rather than conclude that it was no more than a curious coincidence. n David Morrison is a planetary scientist and astrobiologist who after a long career at NASA is now director of the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe at the SETI Institute.

Here are twelve mistakes he made rambling down the garden path of self-delusion. HARRIET HALL He posted a three-part article on \"The Power of Acupuncture\" (Hopkins 2011-2012) on/uni00A0 Navy Medicine Live, the official blog of Navy and Marine Corps Health Care. It is a prime example of how even the most intelligent, educated person can ramble step by step down the garden path into self-delusion. Dr. Hopkins's story can serve as a useful les-son to all of us. Background Acupuncture has been increasingly accepted in military circles. The Air Force is teaching its doctors \"battle-field acupuncture\" (Gorski 2008) based on the faulty evidence of one Air Force doctor, Col. Richard Niemtzow. The/uni00A0 Army is using it to treat PTSD. The Navy offers it too. Hopkins says that after forty years/uni00A0of practicing neurology, \"It was only nat-ural to begin thinking about something else.\" (Why? Boredom? And why pick acupuncture?) When he got an email from his Specialty Leader announcing the opportunity for Navy doctors to learn how to do acupuncture, he sub-mitted his application that same day. He was undoubtedly impressed that this training was being offered by the Navy, lending it the imprimatur of au-thority. His prior impression of acu - puncture was that it was a \"mysterious tool\" that seemed to work, and instead of asking the critical questions, he said he was looking for \"a fundamental sci-entific understanding of acupuncture\" and asking to see the supporting re-search and data. Mistake #1: P rior prejudice./uni00A0 It sounds like he already had a favorable opinion of acupuncture and was predisposed to accept it. Mistake #2: Confirmation bias./uni00A0 He was looking only for confirmation rather than also looking for any disconfirming research. He wanted to understand how it worked; he was not asking whether it worked. He says his intellect was actively engaged by the teacher, a \"charismatic master acupuncturist,\" who laid a neu- rophysiologic foundation for how acu- puncture works. Mistake #3: Getting information from a biased source./uni00A0 A master acupuncturist is hardly likely to present a balanced picture of the evidence for and against the source of his livelihood. In calling the teacher \"charismatic,\" he might have suspected that he could be influ-enced by that charisma to accept things he would not have accepted as readily from a dry, objective presentation of Quacks sell snake oil, and some of them really believe their products work. Medieval doctors who used blood-letting to balance the humors were convinced that it worked. But would you expect an intelligent, highly edu-cated twenty-first-century medical doctor to be fooled (or to delude himself) into believing that a placebo was actually a highly effective treatment? Doctors ought to know better. They're supposedly trained to figure out what really works. But they're only human; they're not exempt from the kind of cognitive errors we are all prone to. Curiously, people who make foolish mistakes are usually so sure of themselves that they're not at all shy about revealing their foolishness to the scrutiny of others. A Navy neurologist, Capt. Elwood Hopkins, has conveniently described for us, in great detail, the process by which his faulty thinking led him into error.Skeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 33scientific evidence about acupuncture's validity. Hopkins was told about local phys- iologic changes in tissues stimulated by needles. He was not told that non-nee-dle \"acupuncture\" (with electrical stim-ulation through intact skin or with sim-ple touching with toothpicks) had been shown equally effective, even when acupuncture points were avoided. He was told that needles caused reversal of tissue acidosis. (This is a claim I don't remember hearing before, and I think it is based on a couple of Chinese studies on animals. Even if true, its clinical rel-evance would be questionable.) He was told about the \"gate control\" hypothesis but was not told that after half a century of investigation it has not been accepted as the explanation for acupuncture's ef-fects. He was told about brain MRI findings and endorphin release but was not told that those same findings can be elicited by placebo pills. I see them as evidence of the mechanism for acu-puncture's placebo effects; he interprets them as evidence that acupuncture \"resets normal controls within the au-tonomic nervous system and maintains CNS homeostasis,\" though it's not clear what that even means; it sounds to me like typical alternative medicine pseu-doscientific doublespeak. Mistake #4: Cherry-picking the litera- ture./uni00A0The charismatic master acupunc- turist snowed Hopkins with every shred of data that might possibly support a physiologic mechanism for acupunc-ture, even providing \"an extensive refer-ence library.\" Did he include the studies showing that it doesn't matter where you put the needles? Did he list the high-quality trials showing that sham acupuncture works just as well? Did he list all the negative systematic reviews or Edzard Ernst's recent systematic review of systematic reviews (Ernst et al. 2011) of acupuncture for pain? It is obvious that he cherry-picked the liter-ature to support his claims. This is easy to do: plenty of low-quality studies of acupuncture have been published. In Part Two of his article, Hopkins actually asks if the clinical effects might be due to placebo. He wonders how we would know, since there is \"no honest way\" to do a properly controlled dou-ble-blind study. His teacher says it is better to go by the functional outcome rather than by patient reports of pain levels. So far, so good. But then Hop - kins throws science out the window and never mentions placebo again. He actually writes, \"There is nothing like personal experience to convince one of an effect. It is a bit like not requir- ing a double blind placebo controlled cross-over study to establish that an open parachute is more effective than a closed one.\" This sounds like it was written by someone ignorant of science and logic rather than by a neurologist. His anal-ogy is a clich\u00e9d fallacy: We don't accept the effectiveness of parachutes because we have had personal experience jump-ing out of planes. I think he meant to say that not every claim requires proof by placebo-controlled trials, which is true but irrelevant here. We don't need to do controlled trials to find out if it is effective to stop hemorrhages or set broken bones, but we do require con-trolled trials to find out if acupuncture works. It's true that personal experience is the best way to/uni00A0 convince/uni00A0 someone there is an effect, but it's useless for determining whether there really/uni00A0 is/uni00A0an effect. To correct his statement: There is nothing like solid scientific evidence to convince a scientist who knows bet-ter than to accept personal experience as evidence. Mistake #5: Not understanding why sci- ence is necessary. It's hard to believe that was written by someone who has gone through medical school and resi-dency training. It's a sad indictment of our educational system. The instructor asks for volunteers and Hopkins offers himself as a guinea pig. The instructor treats him for his Raynaud's disease, telling him he be-lieves it is due to prior cervical injury. As a neurologist, Hopkins should know that the term \"Raynaud's disease\" refers only to idiopathic cases and if the con-dition is secondary to some instigat-ing factor, it is called \"Raynaud's syn-drome.\" Also, while repetitive trauma from vibrating tools like jackhammers and prior injuries to the hands or feet have been recognized as causes of Ray-naud's, \"cervical injury\" has not. There are studies showing that acupuncture is more effective for Raynaud's than drugs or than no treatment, but they are not We don't need to do controlled trials to find out if it is effective to stop hemorrhages or set broken bones, but we do require controlled trials to find out if acupuncture works.34 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirerconvincing because they didn't use pla- cebo control groups. After the treat-ment, Hopkins's symptoms resolved, and he became a believer. Mistake #6: Relying on his personal expe - rience./uni00A0 True believers ask us to \"try it yourself \" and they say, \"I saw it with my own eyes.\" We have ample evidence that seeing something with our own eyes is often misleading, and that trying something for yourself can interfere with your ability to objectively assess the evidence. Mistake #7: The/uni00A0 post hoc ergo propter hoc/uni00A0 improved/uni00A0 after/uni00A0the treatment, they improved/uni00A0 because of/uni00A0 the treatment. He doesn't consider that there might be alternative explanations or con-founding factors. (For example, emotional stress is a known trigger for Raynaud's symptoms.) His classmates were treated for var- ious conditions including nerve abnor-malities and bladder inflammation, and they all \"benefited.\" He calls acupunc-ture a \"safe and inexpensive tool that has been time-tested for several thou-sand years.\" Mistake #8: Relying on the personal expe - rience of others./uni00A0 Testimonials abound for even the quackiest of quack treat- ments. No matter how many anecdotes we manage to accumulate, the plural of anecdote is not data; that's why we do science. Mistake #9: The ancient wisdom fal- lacy./uni00A0 Hopkins is completely wrong about acupuncture being several thou-sand years old (Kavoussi 2010), and even if it were that old, length of use is no indication of truth. Astrology has been around for longer than acu-puncture; does he think its validity has been proven because it has been \"time- tested\"? Bloodletting to balance imag-inary bodily humors was \"time-tested\" for many centuries, but it turned out to do more harm than good. Hopkins devotes Part Three of his article to recounting how he has imple-mented acupuncture in his practice. He has given over one thousand acupunc-ture treatments for everything from headaches to prostatitis. (One wonders why a neurologist would be treating prostatitis.) He claims a 90 percent success rate with many spectacular re-sponses, and even uses the word \"mira-cle.\" He admits that some patients don't respond, saying it is \"never clear why.\" (I think I can guess why!) He reports improvements in control of diabetes and hypertension, less need for medi- cation, better sleep, etc. He concludes that \"It is now evident to me that there truly is a great benefit to acupuncture.\" He says it is safe (although the Ernst study [2011] documented rare but seri-ous adverse effects including death). He says there are no contraindications, but numerous lists of contraindications can be found on the Internet both on acu-puncture websites and on mainstream medical websites. He says the only time he would/uni00A0 not/uni00A0use it was if the patient didn't want it. He recommends that anyone caring for patients should con-sider adding this tool to his or her kit. Mistake #10: Relying on uncontrolled observations. /uni00A0 His patients improved, but how many of them would have improved without any treatment or with a credible placebo that offered some of the nonspecific treatment effects of acupuncture? Mistake #11: P roselytizing on the basis of his own uncontrolled observations. /uni00A0Now that Hopkins has convinced himself, he wants to persuade others by simple assertions and by the same kind of unreliable \"evidence\" that convinced him in the first place. Mistake #12: Not doing his own research./uni00A0Hopkins might have checked PubMed and found a neat new study (White et al. 2012) confirming previous evidence that acupuncture is no more effective than placebo. It showed that patients were more likely to improve if they believed in acupuncture and believed they got the real thing rather than a placebo, regardless of which one they actually got. He might have read what Yale neurologist and CSI Fellow Steven Novella (2007) wrote after independently researching the literature on acupuncture for himself [see also Novella's column, \"What Is Acupuncture?\" S I , July/August 2011]. He might have read the many negative systematic reviews, such as the one (Madsen et al. 2009) Astrology has been around for longer than acupuncture; does he think its validity has been proven because it has been \"time-tested\"?Skeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 35showing that a \"small analgesic effect of acupuncture was found, which seems to lack clinical relevance and cannot be clearly distinguished from bias\" or the systematic review of systematic reviews by Edzard Ernst and others (2011) showing \"numerous contradic-tions and caveats.\" He might have read the many skeptical articles on science blogs. He might have read/uni00A0 The Skeptic's Dictionary/uni00A0 entry on acupuncture. He might have consulted Quackwatch's affiliate Acupuncture Watch. Even just reading the acupuncture article on Wikipedia might have raised some doubts in his mind. At this point, even if he were willing to look at the great mass of disconfirm-ing evidence, he would probably not be capable of judging it objectively. Once someone has become a true believer on the basis of personal experience there is rarely any hope, especially when belief is reinforced by social support and grateful patient feedback. Let's hope he doesn't go on to seek training from a charis-matic homeopath or a reiki master. I can understand why many doctors are less skeptical than they should be about most of the alternative medicine information they encounter: they are used to having predigested, accurate scientific information presented to them by experts. They were (sadly) not taught to question what their teachers said in medical school and residency. They were taught about evidence-based medicine, but they were not taught to take prior probability into account: they are willing to accept the results of controlled studies even when they are incompatible with the rest of scientific knowledge. They rely on published in-formation in medical journals, but they may not realize that half of the studies they read are wrong (Ioannidis 2005). Even if they are good at critically eval-uating scientific medical information, they may not be used to critically an-alyzing information from the realm of alternative medicine. They may not have learned to recognize the common logical fallacies and the pitfalls. The One Big Mistake: Not Follow ing the SkepDoc's Rule of Thumb./uni00A0My rule, which applies to critical thinking in every sphere: before accepting any claim,/uni00A0 find out who disagrees with it and why. Once you fully understand the arguments on both sides, only then are you qualified to judge whether the claim is credible (and it will usually be glaringly obvious which side makes more sense). What if a jury listened to the prosecution but not to the defense? When examined as a whole, the available evidence fits the hypothesis that acupuncture is an elaborate placebo system. Using placebos on patients is unethical. As a retired Air Force colo-nel and as a physician, I am saddened to see acupuncture infiltrate the military health care system. And I am saddened to see how Dr. Hopkins's faulty think-ing led him astray. Our brains evolved for success in survival as hunter-gatherers on the plains of Africa, not for a modern world of science and computers. We prefer stories to statistics, personal anecdotes to scientific studies. System 1 thinking (fast, emotional, and intuitive) is the default mode; it comes more naturally to us and requires much less effort than System 2 thinking (slow, deliberative, and logical). Not everyone reads the S I. Not everyone can overcome the natural tendencies of our flawed brains. Not everyone wants to try. But those who do can learn from Dr. Hopkins's bad example.

It's a natural topic for any- one interested in human nature. The question, \"Is our species innately violent and war-loving, or innately peaceful and cooperative?\" goes back literally hundreds of years, maybe thousands. So it naturally falls under the category of psychology. In my case, it began with my books How the Mind Works and The Blank Slate where I advocated the idea that there is such a thing as human nature\u2014some parts of which can be rather nasty [See Pinker, \"The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature, S- I, March/April 2003]. We have urges like revenge and dominance that can erupt in violence. I had to anticipate an objection I knew would come: If we do have these tendencies, does that mean that we also have to have a fatalistic attitude toward war, peace, and violence? The worry is: if violence is in the genes\u2014if we're killer apes and we have homicidal DNA\u2014then there's nothing you can do about it. But this is a non sequi- tur. The answer is no, we don't have to be fatalistic. For one thing, human nature is a complicated system. Even if we do have urges that can result in vio-lence, we also have systems that can inhibit our urges toward violence. Whether we behave violently depends on which part of human nature prevails, and this balance can change with the circumstances. In any case, there can't be a theoretical debate over whether we're doomed to a constant rate of violence, because when you open up the history books you find that rates of violence change. I gave a few exam-ples of cases that I knew of at the time (this was in the 1990s), of how rates of vio-lence had come down. For example, from the Middle Ages to the present, at least in England, there has been a thirty-five-fold decrease in the rate of homicide. Or if you look at the kind of life that our ancestors presum-ably lived\u2014a foraging life-style, without a government and police force\u2014the rates of death in tribal warfare were really, really high\u2014higher than even in the twentieth century with our world wars. I made these observa- tions, and I noted that there can be no a priori debate about whether rates of vio-lence can change. History tells us that they can change. A few years later, John Brockman, my literary agent and the proprietor of Edge.org, asked 150 scientists, philosophers, and writers for a couple of paragraphs on the question, \"What are you optimistic about?\" I tweaked those relevant sections of previous work and posted them online. Acclaimed Harvard psychologist and best-selling author Steven Pinker was interviewed by Indre Vis- kontas and Chris Mooney in a rare live edition of Point of Inquiry, the flagship podcast of our Center for Inquiry. This special episode was recorded before a live audience as part of the 2013 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)./uni00A0 Pinker, a longtime Committee for Skeptical Inquiry Fellow, is the author of eight books, including How the Mind Works, The Blank Slate, The Language Instinct, and most recently The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined. The interview focuses on the premise of his latest book: that we now live in the least violent and most peaceful period of human history, particularly surprising in light of tragic recent events in Newtown, Connecticut, and Boston. Here is the majority of that interview. ON VIOLENCEAn Interview by Indre Viskontas and Chris Mooneyphoto credit: Henry Leutwyler38 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical InquirerThen I got a slew of cor- respondence from experts on violence who said, \"You really understated the case. There are many other cases where there have been dra-matic declines in violence.\" These were from scattered scholarly communities that had nothing to do with each other. For example, scholars in international relations who study war and peace said things like, \"Gee, you know, it used to be that countries in Europe would start two new wars a year for 500 years. As of 1945, that went to zero.\" Military historians have just been as- tonished at the fact that war between developed coun-tries has pretty much ceased to exist. Other scholars said, \"It's not just England where the homicide rate plunged since the Middle Ages. It's also Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and Scandi-navia.\" Others said, \"It's not just war between rich countries that has declined. If you look at statistics on war worldwide, since 1990, they have been going down, down, down; fewer people are killed in war than ever before.\" Finally, one of my col- leagues in the psychology department said, \"Well, you could have added that rates of child abuse, approval of spanking, domestic vi-olence\u2014all of them are down.\" I realized that no one knew about all of these facts and they're pretty im-portant. The arithmetic trend of violence, positive or negative, is a basic fact. Ev-eryone thinks it's gone up. But in fact, it's gone down. It also posed two delicious challenges to a psychologist. One is to understand why has there been so much vi-olence in the past; the other is to understand why it has come down. These are the two psychological questions that got me going. C/H.sc/R.sc/I.sc/S.sc M/O.sc/O.sc/N.sc/E.sc/Y.sc: You paint the past as a world characterized by brutal violence. What is the causal reason for some kind of change? There are a number of rea- sons, in part, because there are a number of causes of violence. Neurobiologists and neuroethologists have long known that there's no single thing called \"aggres-sion\"; there are multiple systems in the brain that make organisms, including Homo sapiens, aggressive. So you'd expect there to be multiple causes that would drive them down.I think the first and foremost is government\u2014 Hobbes's Theory of the Leviathan. A state with a monopoly on violence can penalize incentives for ag-gression and exploitation by imposing penalties that can-cel out the anticipated gain. If you are likely to be thrown in jail after robbing a liquor store, then you think twice about doing it. That circum-stance makes everyone more peaceful, because not only are you disincentivized from committing aggressive acts, but you know that your ene-mies are too. It has a reverberating effect: you no longer have to maintain a belligerent macho stance to deter your enemies, because the gov-ernment is doing it for you. You no longer have to pur-sue vengeance after the fact at all costs, because again, you can outsource that to the government. So, expla-nation number one would be the Leviathan. We see that the remaining zones of violence in the world are also zones of anarchy. M/O.sc/O.sc/N.sc/E.sc/Y.sc: But that's assuming everyone's being rational: that they are calculating costs and benefits to some extent. But isn't violence largely emotional?Yes, that's right, although the rational incentives and the emotional reactions can play off each other. If you live in a society where there is a rule of law for long enough, it changes your emotions. You become less likely to react with rage if someone gives you the finger or calls you a nasty name. You don't challenge them to a knife fight; you walk away. In the book, I talk about the interplay be-tween these rational calcu-lations and what you do and don't do intuitively. V/I.sc/S.sc/K.sc/O.sc/N.sc/T.sc/A.sc/S.sc: One thing I love about your book is how you couch a lot of these issues within the prisoner's dilemma framework. Describe how we might apply it to issues such as gun control. There is a vocal set of people saying, \"I need a gun because every-body else has a gun; so don't take away my right to have a gun.\" But this then leads to more guns and potentially more violence. In the book, I allude to a version of the prisoner's dilemma\u2014I call it the \"pacifist's dilemma.\" It has the same structure but with different labels in the cells. I use it as a way of answering the somewhat mysterious question of why multiple historical forces all seem to be pushing rates of violence down. Chris asked, \"What are some of the causes?\" and I explained one of them. Among the others are trade and commerce, which, in terms of game theory, has people playing more positive-sum games and few zero- or negative-sum games. If you have networks \"The arithmetic trend of violence, positive or negative, is a basic fact. Everyone thinks it's gone up. But in fact, it's gone down.\"Skeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 39of trade and exchange, it becomes cheaper to buy stuff than to steal it; and other people become more valuable to you alive than dead. If you have a rise of commerce and trade, the in-centives change and people get less violent. A third cause is the expanding circle of sympa-thy. As we consume more fiction, history, and jour-nalism, and engage in more person-to-person contact, it becomes a little harder to dehumanize other people. They expand your sense of empathy and decrease your taste for cruelty. I think the empower- ment of women has been a factor. Societies and eras in which women have more rights, and more of a voice, tend to have less macho violence. And reason and science have played a role; as people intellectualize the human condition, they look at violence as a problem to be solved rather than as a game to be won. I list these different rea- sons that violence has gone down. It's not a reduction-istic, simplistic theory. But why have different forces all pushed in the same direc-tion? Is there some kind of mysterious arc that bends toward justice? The answer is no. There's a more mundane explanation\u2014and now we get to the pacifist's dilemma\u2014which is that violence is, in an objective sense, a really bad thing. It's a nuisance; it's a plague; it's a pestilence. Because even though it's always tempting to an aggressor to exploit a victim, it's far more damag-ing to the victim than it is beneficial to the aggressor. Now over the long run, since aggressors can become victims and vice-versa\u2014empires rise and fall\u2014ob-jectively everyone would be better off if everyone could forswear violence. It really is a better way to live than to blow things up and destroy flesh, and life, and suffer all the other nasty consequences of war. The dilemma is: How do you get the other guy to renounce violence at the same time as you do? This is where the game-theoretic calcula-tion comes in. If I beat my swords into plowshares, and the other guy keeps his as swords, I could find myself at the wrong end of a rather unpleasant confrontation. So how do we both be sure to beat our swords into plow-shares at the same time? That is the human di- lemma. It's like disease or hunger. It's a part of the human condition that sucks. Fortunately, we are smart, we can gradually, in bits and pieces, try to improve our condition. One of the ways that we do it is to try to incentivize everyone to forswear violence at the same time. The common denominator between these pacifying forces, I suggest, is that they all jigger with the payoffs in the matrix and turn the pacifist's dilemma into more of a rational actor circumstance in which we all opt for the mutual non-violence cell. M/O.sc/O.sc/N.sc/E.sc/Y.sc: Why does the U.S. seem to be such a violent place compared to other countries? By a number of criteria, the United States is more violent than other West- ern democracies. Our rate of homicide is two to five times higher than that of other Western democra-cies. We start more wars, and thirty-three of the fifty states have capital pun-ishment, which has been abolished everywhere else. The answer, I think, goes back to settlement patterns in American history. The United States isn't a country; it's at least two countries. The rates of vi-olence in the northern and coastal states are still higher than those of Europe, but not as high as those in the West and South. It's also the blue states that have abolished capital punish-ment and which tend to be more dovish in foreign policy. So in part, this is a question about the Amer-ican South and West. The simplest answer is that they lived in a condition of an-archy until fairly recently, historically speaking. The clich\u00e9, \"The closing of the American frontier,\" refers to an event that took place as recently as in the 1890s. Often in anarchic soci- eties, you see a culture of honor developing. You have to avenge any insult, regard-less of the cost to you, and adopt a belligerent stance, because it's your only pro-tection. This stance got em-bedded into southern and western American culture, whereas the Europeans were beaten into submission by their autocratic kings many centuries ago. V/I.sc/S.sc/K.sc/O.sc/N.sc/T.sc/A.sc/S.sc: How do we get the South or the areas in which there are the most guns to melt their assault rifles and turn them into iPads? I don't have an easy answer to that question, because as you point out, the guns are out there. The gun lobby, having created the situation now says, \"Well, there's nothing we can do about it and so let's make it even worse by having even more people get guns to defend themselves against all those people with guns.\" V/I.sc/S.sc/K.sc/O.sc/N.sc/T.sc/A.sc/S.sc: I'm no expert on the statistics behind gun use and gun violence in the U.S., but I've noted that there are different ways of looking at these statistics. For example, if you look at the number of gun owners in the U.S. versus, say, Canada, the numbers are pretty equivalent. But the number of guns per owner, well, there's a huge difference. That's an important point that's absolutely correct. Moreover, consistent with your statistic is that the number of households with guns in the United States has gone down, even though the number of guns has gone up. There are a smaller and smaller number of people who own bigger and bigger arsenals. V/I.sc/S.sc/K.sc/O.sc/N.sc/T.sc/A.sc/S.sc: This makes me nervous because, of course, our weapons are getting more sophisticated. So even if the overall number of violent peo-ple in the population declines, it takes fewer and fewer to inflict more and more damage as we saw in some of these recent mass shootings. How do we fight that growth and these outliers of people who are particularly violent? I think guns themselves probably aren't the main STEVEN PINKER INT ERVIEW]40 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirerplace to look for an answer; although of course there are many common-sense gun control measures that any sane person would agree should be implemented. But the U.S.-Europe difference is not just a difference in the availability of guns. If you subtract out all the gun ho-micides in the United States and you just look at the homicides committed with, say ropes, candlesticks, and daggers, we still kill people at a higher rate. I don't want to endorse anything that the NRA says, but there is some truth to the idea that it really is people who kill people rather than guns that kill people. That's why I think the psychology and so-ciology of violence is more important than just the weaponry. In talking about ram- page shooters, there's not much you can do; but to be honest, as far as violence goes, it's not that much of a problem in the seem-ingly callous sense of raw numbers. The Sandy Hook shooter killed, what, twen-ty-six people altogether? But every day in the United States, more than forty peo-ple get killed. After all that round-the-clock coverage of Sandy Hook, the cable news networks didn't say, \"Oh, and by the way, we've had another Sandy Hook and-a-half today,\" and then on Thursday, \"We've had another Sandy Hook and-a-half today again,\" and every single day since then. Two categories of vio- lence are peculiar in that they generate a massive amount of publicity, dis-cussion, and concern while inflicting relatively little damage. One is rampage shootings, and the other is terrorism. The worst terrorist attack in history, the September 11, 2001, attacks, killed 3,000 people; and in the United States every year, 16,000 people are killed in homicides. It's not a coincidence. Why do people blow them-selves up? Why do people shoot up a school and then shoot themselves? Well, it's the only guaranteed way to get the world's attention. As Adam Lankford, who just wrote a book on suicide terrorism, points out, let's say you wanted to become famous nationwide, even worldwide, what could you do to guarantee it? Make a great scientific discov-ery? Forget that. Compete on American Idol? Uh-uh. There is only one guaran-teed way to become famous, and that is to kill a lot of innocent people. We've set up that incen- tive structure. It's hard to know how to reverse it. V/I.sc/S.sc/K.sc/O.sc/N.sc/T.sc/A.sc/S.sc: Is that an argu- ment for the media not cover-ing these mass shootings or these sorts of large events? Or people not paying for the coverage? I think it is an argument for making news coverage and policy discussion more in line with those statistics\u2014both the round-the-clock coverage of rampage shoot- ings, and the response to terrorism. Our society was turned upside-down, and we started two foreign wars as a response to terrorism. M/O.sc/O.sc/N.sc/E.sc/Y.sc: Why do more rights for women mean less aggres-sion in society? There are several motives for violence, and in some there's not much of a sex difference. If you're the head of state, you're defend-ing your country's interests among other hostile states. Any woman running a country is going to act in the interests of that country, including waging war when that's the rational thing to do. That's the category of \"violence as a means to an end\"; I don't expect a sex difference. But when it comes to stupid, macho violence\u2014knife fights over a parking space, road rage, fights over a pool table, wars over na-tional honor where nothing is at stake except national honor, campaigns of blood-thirsty conquests, and insane wars of aggression\u2014that's more of a guy thing. In non-state societies, anthropologists have doc-umented a correlation be-tween competition between societies and the state of women's rights. Societies that are more egalitarian tend to be less warlike. It's hard to know what's cause and effect, but there is a correlation. The societies that control women, control their repro-duction by selling them off as brides, by protecting their chastity, by forcing them to become round-the-clock baby factories tend to have more violence. Also, in societies where women have more auton-omy, the first place they ex-ercise that autonomy is their own sexuality, their own reproduction. In places with women's rights, women have fewer babies, they have them later, and as a result, those places are less likely to have youth bulges, which are a risk factor for violence. Another thing that goes along with women's em-powerment is that societies \"In general, when you have anarchy, you have high rates of violence, so if you precipitously remove government, you end up with violent chaos.\"Skeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 41are less likely to murder female newborns or abort female fetuses. If you've got lots of babies coming out, and lots of them are boys\u2014well, that leads to trouble down the line. You get youth bulges of unem-ployed, unattached young men; and that means trou-ble. Societies where women control their reproduction are societies that have fewer of these youth bulges. V/I.sc/S.sc/K.sc/O.sc/N.sc/T.sc/A.sc/S.sc: Are there ex- ceptions to the decline in violence, for example, in countries in Africa? And do those cases help explain the decrease? There are exceptions. It's not a monotonic [stable, neither increasing nor decreasing] nor uniform worldwide phenomenon. One example is the huge increase in violent crime in the United States and most other Western countries starting in the 1960s. An-other is the heyday of geno-cidal totalitarian regimes in the middle decades of the twentieth century\u2014the glory days of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. A third is the rise in civil wars following decolonization in much of the developing world. And even though rates of war in Africa have gone way down over the last couple of decades, many sub-Saharan African countries still have high rates of homicide. This is not some myste- rious force that just brought violence down monotoni-cally everywhere. But at least some of these excep-tions are exceptions that prove the rules. In general, when you have anarchy, you have high rates of violence, so if you precipitously re-move government, you end up with violent chaos. In Iraq, just toppling Saddam Hussein's regime and not putting an effective govern-ment in its place opened the ground for a lot of internal violence. Likewise, when the often oppressive, but at least minimally competent colonial governments gave way to utterly incompetent kleptocracies and tribal fa-voritist regimes, you ended up with a lot of violence in countries in the developing world. M/O.sc/O.sc/N.sc/E.sc/Y.sc: What do you think about Jared Diamond's char-acterization of tribal societies as in a state of perpetual warfare? Perpetual warfare is a bit of an exaggeration, but the observation that the rates of death and warfare are very high is correct. I have a chapter in the book where I go over every quantitative estimate I could find from the ethnographic literature, and also from the archaeo-logical literature, on rates of violence in non-state societ-ies. They span a range; not all of the societies are at war all the time; some are more violent than others. But if you look at the average, it's very high. So Diamond is right. And Napoleon Cha-gnon, another person who's been attacked for making such claims, also has the numbers on his side. V/I.sc/S.sc/K.sc/O.sc/N.sc/T.sc/A.sc/S.sc: Some of the social media we engage in so much now\u2014say, Twitter\u2014put a personality onto people from around the world. I connect with people on Facebook who are in Africa whom I would never have a personal rela-tionship with, but on Face-book, I see pictures of their kids and pictures of their life. And on Twitter, I hear their witty, pithy remarks. Do you think that some of these so-cial media technologies might be pacifying in the end? I suspect over the long-term they might be, because sim-ilar things have happened in the past. One of the puz-zles I take up in the book is why in the second half of the eighteenth century, the world made a quantum leap in humanity. That was the era in which countries stopped disemboweling people for criticizing the king and stopped having public executions. The first movements to abolish slav-ery got traction, debtors' prisons were abolished, and they stopped burning heretics at the stake. Blood sports like dog fighting were abolished. You had the first articulate statements of women's rights, of children's rights, of gay rights, all in the eighteenth century. Our own prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment in the eighth amendment to the Constitution occurred smack-dab in the middle of this process. So what happened in the second half of the eighteenth century? Why did the world wake up and suddenly realize, \"Hey, you know, there might be something a wee bit wrong with slavery after all, even though we've been doing it for thousands of years\"? The most plausible candidate is that the sec-ond half of the eighteenth century saw the rise of affordable printed media and the rise of literacy. If you look at what happened before that era\u2014you can't do experiments, so you do the next best thing and you at least try to identify some exogenous, putative cause that occurs prior in time to the punitive effect\u2014the only one that I was able to find is a massive increase in technologies of cosmopoli-tanism. You had national and international post offices\u2014 the email and Twitter of the time. You had a huge increase in the economic ef-ficiency of publishing books and pamphlets; you had an expansion of the press. It was cheaper to travel from city to city. These cosmo-politan forces back then, I think, led to increasing hu-manitarian sensibilities. There was a second wave of that in the 1950s with the rise of television and electronic media. The Viet-nam War was the first war to be brought into people's living rooms in real time; and it was the first war that had a substantial antiwar movement as it was pro-gressing\u2014which I suspect was not a coincidence. I STEVEN PINKER INT ERVIEW]Anytime in the last few years that I have even mentioned the Queen Mary, the immediate reaction from people within earshot is, \"Ooh! I've heard that she's really haunted!\" My rst reaction is a kind of amusement: how could one even tell the dierence between something being really haunted as opposed to fakely haunted? My next reaction is usually a sigh of, \"Here we go again,\" and my nal reaction more recently has been a kind of oense taken on behalf of the ship. I suppose that since an entire generation has passed since the Queen Mary was in service, the popular understanding of her has morphed into something a little weird and otherworldly rather than something that was a practical means of (elegant) travel. I write this article to express my own dismay but also to try to piece together why the QM has this persistent aura as the \"haunted ship\" and to make a plea to emphasize the real history of the ship as part of her future.What Is a Haunting? I suppose the rst thing to do is to make a concise case for the problem of claiming that anything is \"haunted.\" No, I do not believe in ghosts, and at the same time a truly skeptical position must concede that this is not an outright rejection of the possibility that ghosts might exist, only that they haven't been discovered yet. /T_he problem is that there is no agreement among ghost believers as to what they actually are. If I had to aggregate just from popular ghost-hunting stories, I could paint a picture that ghosts are: sound-producing, light-producing, simultaneously phys ical bodies\u2014 except for when they don't. /T_here are so many denitions and assumed qualities of ghosts that it is impossible to come up with a working denition. In science, I would call that a \"hypothesis.\" Once there is a hypothesis or a working model explaining the properties of ghosts, then one could go about controlled experimentation. No one is at that stage though\u2014be cause, again, ghosts have no known properties. So, no, the things that are claimed as \"evidence\" of ghosts (orbs in photos, mysterious sounds on a tape, a creaky door) can't hold up as scientic evidence until a working hypothesis is established. Furthermore, of course, anecdotes are not evidence. An anecdote is a personal story of a personal experience. It's not a reliable way to make a judgment about the validity of a claim. Our minds are subject to bias, misunderstanding, mis-interpretation, and conflation. /T_he more anecdotes that accumulate don't lead to the credence that the claim is true; it's simply more \"noise.\" Personal experience is usually the absolute worst way to make a judgment about the veracity of any claim. So that's a little taste of why I don't buy it when people make the \"ghost\" claim, but there are far better sources to brush up on your scientic understanding, such as Carl Sagan's /T_he Demon-Haunted World, Michael Shermer's Why People Believe Weird /T_hings, and 50 Popular Beliefs /T_hat People /T_hink Are True by Guy P . Harrison. While you're at it, check out Brian Dunning's excellent (and short!) dismantling of ghost claims in \"Do Ghosts Exist?\" on his blog at www.skepticblog.org/2012/08/30/do-ghosts-exist. /T_here's much more that can be said here, but I want to get back to the Queen Mary. 42 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical InquirerThe Queen Mary Is Not Haunted (But I Understand Why You Think She Is) The RMS Queen Mary, a ship of enormous historical import, has been transformed into a roadside attraction whose owners profit off the allure of \"ghosts.\" Her glorious factual history has been brushed aside in a bid to pander to eager ghost-hunting tourists who aren't thinking critically about the claims. JOHN CH AMPION \"For me, it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.\" \u2014Carl Sagan, /T_he Demon Haunted World I've had a fascination with classic ocean liners for most of my life. In particular, I have had a sincere awe for the RMS Queen Mary (QM) since I rst stayed on board in the early 1980s\u2014well after her retirement in 1967 and subsequent conversion into a hotel. She is a thing of beauty\u2014a near-perfect expression of the industrial design aesthetics of the era (conceived in 1929, launched in 1934, maiden voyage in 1936). To say that we don't make them like we used to is an insulting understatement.Skeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 43History /T_he Queen Mary was one of the crowning achievements of the art and industry of shipbuilding. She was created and sailed in an era after the Edwardian opulence of ships like the Titanic and Lusitania and just before the jet age had arrived. She's a blend of old hand-craftsmanship with the speed and technology of modern industrial achievement. To put it in twenty-rst-century terms, she was a marvel of art and design in the way that the space shuttle amazed onlookers thirty years ago or the 787 Dreamliner and Airbus 380 do today. She held the speed record for crossing the Atlantic for nearly two decades and carried more troops at a single time than any other vessel during World War II. After an exceptional service history (and with the speed and economy of air travel relegating ocean travel to vacation cruising), the QM was set for retirement in Long Beach as a hotel/conference center/tourist attraction. Since 1967, tourists have visited her in dry dock and gotten a small taste of what travel was like when the \"Queens\" ruled the seas. Retirement, sadly, would be anything but peaceful. As soon as she pulled into port for the last time, the Queen Mary was subjected to numerous \"renovations\" and conversions that would forever mar her interior. Entire sections have been gutted, rooms and artifacts lost to history, artwork destroyed, and other blunders of huge proportion. /T_he ship's operations and ownership have changed hands numerous times in the years since, and she has struggled economically. In many respects, the experience has been \"dumbed down\" with subpar restaurants (with some notable exceptions), chintzy events, and history taking a backseat to exploitative tours\u2014the most prominent and most egregious of which is the \"ghost\" tour. In the early 2000s, the \"Ghosts and Legends Tour\" was installed. It makes use of some very interesting (and otherwise o limits) spaces of the ship. Fantastical tales of the paranormal are woven into the ship's actual history and presented with a theatrical flair and some low-rent special eects. Tourists see the magnicent rst-class pool area but not in any state resembling its days at sea. /T_his version is fading, cracking and lled with fog. /T_he real-life accident with the Curacao \u2014in which 239 sailors perished\u2014is played out for maudlin drama in a former mail hold that plays the part of the \"bow.\" The Problem with the \"Haunting\" On any night at the Queen Mary, groups of tourists who are interested can also take a guided tour from a \"paranormal\" expert guide. /T_hey bump around wav-ing electronics of dubious utility in the air hoping for some \"evidence\" of an apparition. /T_hey can explore otherwise o limits sections of the ship and really take their time exploring while asking each other, \"Did you hear something?\" If you're more interested in learning the true history of the ship, your options are a bit more limited. /T_here is a \"behind the scenes tour\" (which seems to be confused at various times with the \"Golden Age\" tour and others) as well as a self-guided audio tour, which is in desperate need of renovation itself. Depending on the guide you have for the \"behind the scenes\" tour, you may have a dramatic interpretation of events on board or a rote telling of facts and gures. Much of this can be gleaned by a read of any Queen Mary books or the Wikipedia page about her. So let's think about this. /T_he Queen Mary is actively promoted as a \"haunted\" attraction (and I'm sure they are making a decent amount of money from that), but a serious, concerted eort to preserve her factual history is somehow pushed to the wayside. At best, it's an annoyance to those of us who want to understand and appreciate this vessel from her service and the stories of the people on board. At worst (and this is what is happening more often than not) the \"haunting\" is such a priority that it leads to actual damage of those historic areas, preventing further and future preservation. One historian points out that on this massive vessel only about six public rooms remain intact (though without much of their original art or 44 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirerfurnishings). Others were ripped out entirely, recongured or converted for other vaguely dened uses. /T_he First Class Pool is \"ground zero\" for the alleged paranormal activity so many ghost enthusiasts are seeking. (/T_he Second Class Pool has been utterly destroyed in one of the many \"conversion\" episodes.) At the time, the pool was a stunning room at sea with gleaming tiles and art deco style. Today, the ghost tour trades on the pool's decrepitude, proting o of the \"creepy\" allure of cracked tiles, warped floors, and broken xtures. What is the incentive to restore this magnicent space to its original condition when a quick buck can be made o of ghost tours? When the pool nally falls through (the lower supports have been removed), maybe that will just add to the narrative for the cynical exploitation of the space. But I Get It... I can't get enough of the Queen Mary. I'll stay on board at every opportunity and sign up for any tour, event, or promotion they have. Unlike so many other historic relics, the Queen Mary feels very much alive, not like a stuy museum piece that can only be experienced at a distance. It is im mersive, impressive, and totally consuming. /T_his, to me, is why we can't get enough of those ghost stories and why people are utterly convinced that their own experiences (anecdotes based on misinterpretation, strongly held predisposition, and the excitement of fantasy) are proof positive of the supernatural. /T_he Queen Mary was built to be in motion. She feels like she is in motion even when she is standing perfectly still in dry dock. /T_he extreme shear of the decks (the curve that is apparent in the longest stretches of corridor) plays with your normal perception of space. We're not accustomed these days to being inside structures with such tight compartments, such detail in wood and metal constructed with an artistic eye but, underneath, all machine. Its power\u2014even with the engines now long dormant\u2014is palpable through the deck plating. Every rivet, every section of carpet, every porthole was witness to the widest variety of intensely human experience. From the builders who put her together to the crew who stayed with her in extreme circumstances to the celebrating passengers, every square centimeter has been a part of a pageant of history. One can't help but stand in a room onboard and immediately conjure up the images of the hundreds of thousands who occupied the same space years, decades before. She makes great noises, even sitting still, as the metal skin holding her together expands and contracts and pieces jostle around after seventy-ve-plus years of settling. We don't get that in our daily experience in the interactions we have with architecture. We don't stop to think about who came before us when walking into a conventional building lit up by fluorescent glare. I really get it. When I'm on board, my imagination is ring at full steam. If I'm quiet, I can't help but hear what the ship must have been like when operating on the Atlantic. If I look closely enough, I can see the throngs of people who populated her decks during decades of heroic crossings. I draw a line, though. It's a priority for me to draw a sharp distinction between fact and fantasy. I want to honor the people who built and sailed on this magnicent vessel by remembering who they really were and what they really did. /T_here are plenty of stories there to entertain and educate. I don't want to taint that memory by confusing their actual lives with a creepy \"ghost\" story traded for the value of a ticket to a roadside tourist attraction. I'm disappointed to think that the Queen Mary presents an either/or proposition. /T_hrough mismanagement and the chase after a quick buck, the fantasy-prone among us have won out with the tourist attraction to the demise of historic preservation. Ghost stories are ne when they are presented as such. /T_he confusion of science and history with ction, though, gets us further and further away from the ability to relish in and truly explore our own recent history.

Mirrorpix/NewscomSkeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 45Investigating Plagiarism in New Age Books Shoddy research is almost expected in New Age books, but an investigation of a supposed reference work on vampires found and documented something even worse\u2014rampant plagiarism. BENJ AMIN RADFORD One particular tome The Element Encyclopedia of Vampires: An A-Z of the Undead. As an aficionado (and investigator) of monsters, vam-pires, zombies, and the like, I'm always interested in seeing new books, espe-cially if they offer some new informa-tion on the topic. The book was about 650 pages long and would surely con-tain something new, so I picked it up. When I see a new book on the paranormal or unexplained I often flip through to find a discussion or two of topics with which I am familiar, so that I can get an idea of how well-researched the book is. If it's fairly accurate I'll buy it, but if I see many obvious factual and logical errors I know the book is gar - bage. So I naturally first turned to a topic I am intimately familiar with, a sub-ject that I am, for better or worse, the world's top expert on: the vampire beast el chupacabra. I found a significant entry on it spanning four pages. Some of the information was right, much of it was wrong or misleading, but there was one thing that jumped out at me\u2014this sen-tence on page 137: \"In 2005, Isaac Es- pinoza spent millions of his own money trying to hunt down the chupacabra. He lived in the jungles of South Amer-ica for eight months with a team of re-searchers, video and print journalists, and local guides.\" I was puzzled by this. In my five years of thorough research into the chupacabra I'd never heard of this Isaac Espinoza researcher. If he spent millions of dollars and eight months in the jungles of South America, he definitely seemed like someone who I'd have heard of (and probably should have interviewed!). The author, The-resa Cheung, surely hadn't just made him up in a reference work published by HarperCollins. I began to ques-tion my own research and scholarship: How could I have missed Espinoza's research? I knew I hadn't come across Espi- noza in the dozens of books and articles and interviews I'd done; perhaps an In-ternet search would solve the mystery. I did a Google search for \"Isaac Es-pinoza\" and \"chupacabra\" and found about 200 hits. The top hit was from a website called UnknownExplorers.com. There was no other information on Espinoza; the same set of sentences appeared on each site, with no varia-tion, which struck me as odd. Surely Espinoza would at least have his own website, or have appeared in media arti-cles by one of the many researchers and journalists who accompanied him. Not only that, but there was another clue that something wasn't right: The poor grammar was identical. \"Isaac Espinoza spent millions of his own money\" doesn't make sense; Espinoza may have spent millions of dollars of his own money, but \"money\" is an unquantified noun; one cannot spend millions of \"moneys.\" Had both the original author (whoever it was) and Cheung written an identically incorrect sentence? Or was there more involved? My skeptical sense was tingling. 1 It seemed clear that Cheung had simply cut and pasted the information about Espinoza from the web into the chupacabra entry in the encyclopedia she was writing. If she was so indiffer-ent to factual accuracy in her book that she would use someone else's words without bothering to check to see if the information was true (much less \"credit\" them), then what did that say about her other research? In early 2011 I published a book titled Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction, and Folk- lore. A few weeks after it was released, I happened to be in a local store looking for books to add to my skeptical library. 46 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical InquirerI photocopied the chupacabra entry and skimmed it with different colored highlighting pens. Using my own ch-upacabra notes, books from my library, and the Internet, after several hours I identified no less than four different sources from which Cheung had taken her words, often verbatim. I was shocked that the plagiarism was so obvious and so rampant. Fur-thermore, I realized that it was very un-likely that the one subject entry in the encyclopedia that I happened to fact-check was the only one that had such a problem. I contacted a colleague, Josh Hunt, to assist with my investigation, and together we worked on and off for several weeks spot-checking other ran-dom entries in the encyclopedia. Plagiarism is a serious accusation, and I did not want to publicly accuse Cheung unless my case was airtight. Any author can make a few forgivable, careless mistakes in forgetting (or fail-ing) to adequately reference other writ-er's works; it happens. However, as the weeks passed it became clear that the plagiarism in The Element Encyclopedia of Vampires was both unmistakable and rampant. This was not an isolated in-cident. Finally after hours of meticulous research I contacted a HarperCollins representative in the United Kingdom, where the book was published. My email is printed below. Dear Siobhan Kenny, Our research has found numerous instances of material apparently pla-giarized by HarperCollins author Theresa Cheung in her book The Element Encyclopedia of Vampires. Plagiarism, as you know, is the appropriation of another person's ideas, results, or words without giv-ing appropriate credit. It is not lim-ited to verbatim copying of anoth-er's work, but includes paraphrasing. Any words written by another author must be correctly cited and quoted. Material that is taken directly and verbatim from another author's work must appear either in quota-tion marks or block quotes, and be clearly identified either in text or in citations as that author's words. Specific citation and reference styles of course vary from house to house (and sometimes project to project), but all of them are designed explic-itly to avoid plagiarism. I am not only the author of five books and columnist (Discovery News and LiveScience.com) but also have been a magazine editor for 12 years, and I am familiar with the standards and practices of both book and magazine publishing. As I'm sure you are aware, pla- giarism is a serious issue. In fact just last month Germany's defense min-ister, Karl-Theodore zu Guttenberg, was forced to resign from his post because he was found to have pla-giarized parts of his doctoral disser-tation. Exposed cases of plagiarism have damaged author's careers and raised questions about the credibility and professionalism of their editors and publishers. The first example I uncovered is in Cheung's entry on Chupacabra (page 136). From my research, over 80% of her entry was taken, uncred-ited, from other sources\u2014principally the Web sites www.weirdsciences. net, www.unknownexplorers.com, and www.weird-encyclopedia.com, as well as Bob Curran's book Vampires: A Field Guide to the Creatures That Stalk the Night (2005, New Page Books). One of the sites, www.unknownexplorers.com, is no longer online, but I have attached an archived screen shot of the relevant Web page, and it can also be found by searching www.waybackmachine.com. For example: 1) The last third of the first paragraph, beginning with \"Some autopsy re ports\" and ending with \"drained of blood\" (p. 137) was taken ver- batim from http://www.weird- encyclopedia.com/chupacabras.php: \"Some autopsy reports show damage to internal organs such as the liver, without any local exterior damage. Mutilations are performed with surgical preci-sion. One report speaks of a cow, completely skinned from head to hoof, and drained of blood.\" 2) The next paragraph is merely a collection of generic descriptions that could have come from any-where, but the third paragraph (under \"Reported Attacks,\" p. 137) was paraphrased (with some sciences.net/weird-sciences-home-page/aliens-ufo-and- extraterrestrials/chupacbras/: \"The legend of cipi chupacabra began in about 1992, when Puerto Rican newspapers El Vocero and El Nuevo Dia began re porting the killings of many different types of animals, such as birds, horses, and as its name implies, goats. However, it is pre-dated by El Vampiro de Moca (The Vampire of Moca), a crea-ture blamed for similar killings that occurred in the small town of Moca in the 1970s.\" 3) The second half of the para- graph under \"Reported Attacks,\" beginning with \"For a time the carnage\" and ending with \"Baja, California\" was copied verbatim and in its entirety from page 49 of Bob Curran's book Vampires: A Field Guide to the Creatures That Stalk the Night (2005, New Page Books); see attached scan. 4) The following four paragraphs, beginning with \"In July 2004\" (p. 137) and ending with \"wolf in the area\" (p. 138) were copied verbatim from http://weirdsciences.net/ weird-sciences-home-page/ aliens-ufo-and-extraterrestrials/chupacabras/. 5) The following paragraph, begin- ning with \"On January 11, 2008\" and ending with \"long back legs\" was taken nearly verbatim from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chupacabra. 6) The next paragraph, beginning with \"Among the hill people\" and ending with \"it needs blood to survive\" was copied nearly verba-tim from page 50 of Bob Curran's book Vampires: A Field Guide to the Creatures That Stalk the Night (2005, New Page Books); see at tached scan. 7) The following two paragraphs, beginning with \"an alternative explanation\" and ending with \"strange characteristics\" were taken largely verbatim from www. unknownexplorers.com. 8) The next paragraph, from \"There is of course\" to \"a cow dry\" was taken from http://www.weird-encyclo- pedia.com/chupacabras.php , with the ex ception of the third and Skeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 47fourth sentences, which were in- stead copied from www.weird-sciences.net. According to our analysis, there are approximately fifteen sentences (out of four pages of copy) on this particular entry that may be Cheung's own words and that did not appear in works by previous authors. Most of these fifteen \"original\" sentences are so generic in content that it's difficult or impossible to trace a spe-cific source. (I might also add that much of this information is not only plagiarized, but inaccurate as well. If Cheung is going to take other people's work and claim it as her own, at least she could use correct information.) Once we knew what to look for, it became clear how Cheung \"wrote\" those entries of her book; she merely typed a subject name into the Google search engine and then cut and pasted paragraphs from the top three or four hits, changed a few words, and then submitted it as her own work. Had Cheung done this but cred- ited the writers and sources she copied from, this would merely demonstrate that she is a poor writer and lazy researcher. However, since in most cases the words are taken directly and unmistakably from other sources, it seems she has indeed en-gaged in plagiarism. I note that Cheung provides a \"Select Bibliography\" at the end of her book with a few dozen sources. As I'm sure you're aware, this does not absolve Cheung (nor HarperCollins) from the charges of plagiarism. Any words taken from other sources and written by other authors and used without proper attribution constitute plagiarism. Given how flagrant the plagia- rism was, with Cheung apparently lifting well over three-quarters of other peoples' material for that one entry, it seemed unlikely that this was the only example in the book. So we continued the investigation, and selected entries at random to see if we could find evidence of plagiarism elsewhere. Indeed, it is apparently rampant in Cheung's book. [I then provided five other exam- ples of plagiarism in the book (see sidebars). Space does not permit a full elaboration of the plagiarism, but a full comparison between Cheung's Plagiarism in 'Estrie' entry (p. 212) : Cheung seems to have heavily plagiarized most of this entry in her book from Joshua Trachtenberg's book Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion (2008). 1A: \"It is difficult to determine whether the estrie was regarded as a true demon, or as a witch; it was described, sometimes in the same source, as both. Included among the incorporeal spirits, it was none the less also a woman, a flesh-and-blood member of the community. In either guise her character was that of the vampire, whose partic-ular prey was little children, though she did not disdain at times to include grown-ups in her diet. The sense of these passages appears to be that she is an evil spirit who adopts woman's form and spends her life among men, the more readily to satisfy her gory appetites. The equation of the estrie with the broxa leads one to believe that she was best known in her human form.\" (Trachtenberg 2008, 43) 1B: \"It is difficult to determine whether the estrie was regarded as a true demon or as a witch, as it was described, sometimes in the same source, as both. Included among the incorporeal spirits, it was nonetheless always a woman, a flesh-and-blood member of the com-munity. In either guise her character was that of the vampire whose particular prey was little children, though she did not disdain at times to include grown-ups in her diet. The sense of surviving descriptions about the estrie appears to be that she was an entity who adopted a woman's form and spent her life among men, the more readily to satisfy her gory appetites, and that she was best known in her human form.\" (Cheung 2010, 212) 2A: \"If an estrie was wounded by a human being, or was seen by him (in her demonic state), she must die unless she could procure and consume some of his bread and salt. A man who was attacked by an estrie in the shape of a cat and beat her off, was approached by the witch the next day and asked for some of his bread and salt. When he was innocently about to grant her request an old man intervened and scolded him sharply for his generosity. 'If you enable her to remain alive, she will only harm other men.'\" (Trachtenberg 2008, 43) 2B: \"If an estrie was wounded by a human being, or was seen by one (in her demonic state), she would die unless she could procure and consume some of the person's bread and salt. According to one report, a man who was attacked by an estrie in the shape of a cat and beat her off, was approached by the witch in the form of a woman the next day and asked for some of his bread and salt. When he was innocently about to grant her request, an old man intervened and scolded him sharply for his generosity: 'If you enable her to remain alive, she will only harm other men.'\" (Cheung 2010, 212)48 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirerwork and the works she used is available on the CSI website at www.csicop.org/extras.] There are likely more (many more) entries that may have been copied from other sources, but we stopped after finding evidence of plagiarism in a stunning eight out of ten randomly-selected entries we spot-checked. (For other sus-picious entries you might want to start with Lastovo Island Vampires (p. 350)\u2014compare with informa-tion at http://morbidhistory.tumblr.com/post/1182250736/lastovo- island-vampires.) Whether the majority of this book was written by other authors (as I suspect), or just these, I cannot say. Ultimately, of course, the respon-sibility for the accuracy of what is printed lies with the author and the publisher. We have satisfied our-selves that there is enough evidence of plagiarism by this author to go forward with the investigation and bring it to your attention. I note that Cheung is the author of at least three other HarperCollins titles; this could be the tip of a very big, very embarrassing iceberg if pla-giarism plagues those other books as well. If HarperCollins chooses not to investigate Cheung's other titles (and perhaps those by other authors in the Element series), we just might do so ourselves. My ad vice, for what it's worth, is to do a thor-ough investigation and get ahead of the problem. I also note that Ms. Cheung thanks Jeannine Dillon, senior editor at HarperCollins, in the Acknowledgements. As I'm sure you agree, plagiarism in HarperCollins titles is a serious issue that strikes at the reputation and credibility of the company, its authors, and imprints. Not only has Cheung apparently engaged in pla-giarism, but HarperCollins may have violated laws by using copyrighted material in your books\u2014likely from dozens of other authors. I have not yet contacted any of the various copyright holders to let them know about this issue. The apparent plagiarism has other implications as well, such as for factual accuracy. If Cheung has simply cut and pasted other peo-ple's work, then she obviously cannot vouch for the factual accuracy of the material in her book. If a writer presents a book as his or her own, there is an expectation that the work was written by that person, and that the information has been examined and found credible by that author. If Cheung simply uses other people's word and work (with or without credit, and with little or no original research), how can HarperCollins ensure the factual accuracy of your books? This case also raises questions about editorial competence. With such a diversity of writing styles from a variety of other sources supposedly having been written by Cheung, it's hard to see how experienced pro-fessional editors could have failed to detect the plagiarism. Of course, some author writing styles are more prominent than others, but it's curi- Plagiarism in 'Vampire Myth: Rational Perspectives' entry (p. 410) Cheung seems to have plagiarized more than a few lines in her \"Ratio-nal perspectives\" subsection for her \"Myth, Vampire\" entry from Karen Thomp son and her piece \"The Mythology of the Vampire\" found here: http://kekrops.tripod.com/Mythology_Vampire.html (accessed March 3, 2011). 1A: \"He certainly cannot be viewed only as a mythological phenome- non.\" (Karen Thompson) 1B: \"it is a creature that cannot be viewed entirely from a mythological perspective . . .\" (Cheung 2010, 410). 2A: \"at the time when vampires were truly feared, people in coma or shock were often buried alive; those who managed to escape their pre-mature graves were looked upon with awe because they had 'returned.'\" (Karen Thompson) 2B: \"At the time when vampires were truly feared, people in coma or shock were often buried alive; those who managed to escape their pre-mature graves were therefore regarded as vampires.\" (Cheung 2010, 410) 3A: \"Another facet was the coincidence of plagues and the onset of vampire attacks. The vampire attacks were always considered an epi-demic because anyone killed by a vampire became one, and the numbers increased in a rapid mathematical progression as did the victims of a plague. The vampire, then, is at least partially scientifically explainable.\" (Karen Thompson) 3B: \"Another facet of the story is the coincidence of plagues and the onset of vampire attacks. The vampire attacks were always considered an epi-demic because anyone killed by a vampire became one and the numbers increased in a rapid mathematical progression, as did the victims of a plague. The vampire, then, is at least partially scientifically explainable.\" (Cheung 2010, 410) For more examples, see Online Extras on our website at csicop.org/extrasous that no one in the editorial department at HarperCollins appar-ently noted Cheung's broad range of styles. It is Theresa Cheung's name on the cover, Jeannine Dillon's name in the Acknowledgements as her primary editor, and HarperCollins's name throughout. You noted in your previous email that HarperCollins \"investigates any claims that are asserted against our books,\" and I will be happy to assist in that investigation in any way I can. I look forward to seeing the results of that HarperCollins internal inves-tigation, and would appreciate being kept updated on the progress of that investigation. I look forward to hearing from you, and hope we can schedule a time for an interview regarding this matter. All best, Ben Radford I eventually got the following re- sponse back: HarperCollins adheres to the high- est editorial standards and we take any allegations of plagiarism very seriously indeed. . . . We have inves- tigated the issues you have raised be low in relation to the \"Element En cyclopedia of Vampires\" by Ther esa Cheung and published by Harper Collins Publishers Limited (the \"Encyclopedia\") and have discussed them with Theresa. In the creation of the \"Element Encyclopedia of Vampires\" the author conducted a vast amount of research using a wide range of different source materials. This was a huge undertaking con-ducted over a long period of time and, whilst the author assures us the highest standard of care was used, an understandable level of human error occurred and some source materials were not correctly credited. Neither HarperCollins nor Theresa would wish to deny credit to the authors of this source material and these will be referenced in all future print-runs of the Encyclopedia. We are also satisfied that the uses of the works in question are not a breach of copy-right. We hope that this addresses your concerns.The fact that over half of Cheung's book may not have been written by her was apparently all just a little mistake, \"an understandable level of human error.\" Having written six books myself, I would be mortified if anyone found this level of human error in my writing. I replied, Thank you for your response, I appreciate you getting back to me promptly. I do have a very few fol-low-up questions, as your previous response was not entirely clear 1) In the majority of the entries we found problems with, Cheung sim-ply did a Google search for a given topic, and then cut and pasted the material (often verbatim) into her own work. Is this normal and accept-able research and writing practice for HarperCollins nonfiction authors?2) Since Cheung often used other authors' words and work (with or without credit, and with little or no original research), how can HarperCollins ensure the factual accuracy of this and other titles?3) Did Cheung state whether or not her other books were researched and written with the same \"highest stan-dard of care\"? Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you. I never did get an answer to these questions, and HarperCollins refused further comment. I Acknowledgements I would like to thank Josh Hunt for his assistance in researching this case. Seeking the sources for plagiarized material can be a tedious and time-consuming effort. It may take an author mere seconds to cut and paste (or re-type) material from a given source, but re-locating that original source and identifying what specific material was used may take hours of time. Note 1. As far as I can tell, Isaac Espinoza doesn't even exist and is likely a figment of someone's imagination in a snippet of fiction that got cop-ied from one place to another without anyone bothering to do any basic research to find out if it's true. The fact that 200 websites report his existence and activities as fact should be pro-foundly embarrassing, and reveals the incredibly sloppy (or nonexistent) scholarship of these sites. This incident also provides insight into how dubious information can make the easy transi-tion from unchecked, pure fiction of the Internet to the printed word published in a supposedly authoritative encyclopedia and endorsed by a reputable international publisher. Many people know enough to be skeptical about information on the web but assume that information in a fixed, printed form is likely to be more accurate and reliable because it has presumably been seen and fact-checked by editors\u2014not to mention that an author would take pride in his or her work and be careful not to mislead or misinform readers.

TOMASZ WITKOW SKI and MAC IEJ Z ATONSKI One of the most efficient ways to overcome this problem is to present critical thoughts in catchy, fresh, cre-ative, and simple forms that appeal to many and force individuals to reflect on the subject. An extraordinary, striking thought presented in an appropriate way can easily reach the media and the public\u2014just as viral videos (or Internet memes) spread around the world. A good example of such a skeptical \"viral meme\" was the \"Overdose Event\" during the 10:23 Campaign, carried out to raise awareness about sham (pla-cebo) treatments unethically sold to the public as real medicines\u2014specifically explaining to the public how doctors and scientists know that homeopathic \"remedies\" are just empty sugar pills. This international campaign, organized by skeptical organizations around the world and coordinated by Merseyside Skeptics Society in the United King-dom, was launched February 6, 2011, at 10:23 in more than seventy cities across thirty countries on all continents. The launch date of the campaign (6.02 at 10:23) was chosen to honor Amedeo Avogadro\u2014the Italian scientist most noted for his contributions to molecular theory. In tribute to him, the number of elementary entities in one mole of a substance (6.02\u00d710 23) is known as Avo- gadro's constant. Homeopathic \"reme-dies\" (or \"homeopathic confectionary\" as we prefer to call them) claim to contain active ingredients in dilutions exceeding 1:10 200. This means that ho- meopathic bottles of sugar pills (sold as medicines) do not contain even a single molecule of the substance they claim to contain. The 10:23 Campaign turned out to be a major success of skeptics world - wide. Homeopathic sales dropped sig-nificantly in some countries, legislative changes were introduced in others, and one French manufacturer of popular homeopathic products is facing a $30 million class action lawsuit in Can-ada. The suit alleges that sales of Os-cillococcinum, a homeopathic product marketed for flu-like symptoms, vio-late consumer protection laws by mis-informing them about the contents of the supposed medication. The three qualities that helped David defeat Goliath were accuracy, wit, and intelligence. Since skeptics around the world are usually David to pseudoscience's Goliath, it is necessary to organize events like the 10:23 Cam-paign. The expansion of information technologies has resulted in a virtual arms race between pseudoscientists and skeptics trying to expose false claims. The Internet, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media and mobile technologies help us to reach thousands of people quickly. Nowadays, spreading myths is much easier than it was in the previous century\u2014but so is exposing them. However, the fundamental prob-lem (how to appeal to a wide audience with proper scientific evidence) still remains, and it cannot be easily overcome by technology. Skeptics struggle with how to engage the public in critical thinking. Critical thinking can be difficult, and many people believe in myths that cannot be easily disproved. How do we put doubt in minds indoctrinated for decades? How do we break through the wall of propaganda raised by commercialized pseudoscience?Skeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 51Polish skeptics have used similar tactics during a nationwide campaign against myths deeply rooted in the psy-chological sciences. To attract public and media attention to the problem of pseudoscientific claims and urban legends, we have chosen one myth strongly connected to clinical and fo-rensic psychology in Poland\u2014the Ror-schach inkblot test. Many clinicians believe that if we allow a person to respond to ambiguous stimuli, we can reveal their hidden emo - tions and/or internal conflicts. Many psychologists are strongly convinced that inkblots, unclear (blurry) photos, or even drawings made by patients are \"secret passageways\" to hidden per-sonality traits. This somehow allows them to make an accurate diagnosis of numerous psychological disorders. Some of them even believe that they can penetrate the deepest and dark-est parts of unconscious minds. The belief in the diagnostic power of\u2014as we call them\u2014\"projective techniques\" remains popular among psychologists despite the evidence showing other-wise. Unfortunately, not just clinical psychologists share these beliefs. Many forensic psychologists use these tests alone during their expert testimonials in court. In fact, the Rorschach inkblot test is an extremely problematic instrument, and the majority of its indices have not been empirically supported. (See Wood, Nezworski, Lilienfeld, and Garb, \"The Rorschach Inkblot Test, Fortune Cold Reading,\" S I, July/August 2003.) The Rorschach norms are problematic and tend to identify non-existent pathology in many normal people. The evidence for the validity of Rorschach tests in detecting thought disorder, and prom- ising evidence for Rorschach indices for dependency, psychotherapy outcome, and a few other characteristics do not justify its overuse\u2014especially in legal settings. Even the authors of the recent, more sanguine meta-analysis on the va-lidity of individual Rorschach variables (Mihura et al. 2012) suggest caution in using this method and encourage clini-cians to use multi-method assessments rather than basing conclusions on the Rorschach test alone. The problems described above are not atypical, nor are they limited to Poland. Underwager and Wakefield (1993) described many \"horrible examples\" related to the use of projective tests. Lilienfield (1999) and Lilienfeld et al. (2000) wrote detailed reviews about problems caused by ap - plying projective techniques in clinical diagnosis. The aim of this article is not to pres- ent problems caused by the use of poor methods of diagnosis, nor to present numerous research results. Instead, The belief in the diagnostic power of\u2014as we call them\u2014\"projective techniques\" remains popular among psychologists despite the evidence showing otherwise.The main logo of the campaignParticipants in the campaign52 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirerwe want to show the impact of a cam- paign planned, prepared, organized, and coordinated by the Polish Skeptic Club (KSP) in Poland in March 2012. The campaign was called \"Psychology Is Science, Not Witchcraft,\" and its aim was to raise awareness to prob-lems caused by overusing projective techniques (the Rorschach inkblot test being an excellent example) that are widely recognized (or even respected) among the public. The \"Psychology Is Science, Not Witchcraft\" campaign had three goals: To explain to the public that many pro-jective tests have poor or no validity; to raise concerns among professional psy-chologists who still use such tests alone in clinical diagnosis or in legal proceed-ings; and to initiate public and scientific discussion about the use of projective techniques. Preparations Before the campaign, we obtained the support of some well-known academics and authorities in Polish psychology. As the second step, we brought together nongovernmental organizations and individuals interested in supporting our campaign. Next, we prepared con-tent-related materials providing proper scientific evidence (such as research results). We created a list of public and private institutions that widely pro-mote and use projective techniques in Poland and edited a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs). We also did an extensive literature search and pre-pared a list of all available evidence on projective tests. Having prepared the theoretical framework, we created graphics and artwork (pictures, draw- ings, banners, slideshows, T-shirts). We made ten banners, one for each ink-blot from the original Rorschach test, describing potential dangers caused by projective tests. Most of them were focused on using projective techniques in court proceedings. Other artwork criticized the use of projective tests during job interviews (still performed in armed forces, national security agen-cies, and numerous private corporations when employing staff ). Some banners pointed out the problem of spending public research money on inkblots. We also designed several T-shirts with different slogans. One of the important elements of our campaign was the publication of Rorschach's original inkblot tables to-gether with typical answers on the Polish version of Wikipedia and on numerous public and private Internet portals and blogs. Since they were orig-inally published on the English version of Wikipedia (after the copyrights ex-pired), they were translated into thirteen different languages. This fact remained unknown to many Polish psychologists. That's why publication of Rorschach's inkblot tests together with their inter - pretation in the Polish language trig-gered a wave of wrath and indignation among many clinicians. This led to a nationwide public discussion. Just before the launch of our cam- paign we prepared a website, Twitter feed, and Facebook fan page dedicated to our campaign. At the very end we issued a press release to journalists and the media. The Campaign The following message was released to the media: \"Over one hundred aca-demics, scientists, students, and psy-chologists will protest against using invalid methods of psychological diag-nosis.\" And it worked: Information about our campaign was published in major influential nationwide journals, newspapers, radio stations, and on the largest Polish Internet portals. Over 140 people from nine large nongov-ernmental organizations took part in the protest. Scientists, lecturers, and students wore the T-shirts for four days at universities, in their workplaces, and on the streets. We issued an open letter to the Pol- ish Psychological Association (PPA)\u2014the largest association of psychologists in Poland\u2014with a request to stop selling projective tests and using them in legal proceedings. The association directly supervises Laboratory of Psy-chological Tests Ltd. (LPT)\u2014the main distributor of psychological tests in Poland. PPA has significant influence over diagnostic practices in Poland, be-cause the Polish Ministry of Justice cer - tifies all methods offered by LPT Ltd. for the purpose of legal proceedings. Unfortunately LPT sells and promotes We\u2014as skeptics and as psychologists\u2014can either help people with our knowledge or seduce them with unrealistic empty promises. It is our choice, but also our responsibility. Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2013 53the use of many discredited projective tests, such as the Color Pyramid Test, the Szondi's Test, and others. Foren-sic psychologists in Poland are also al-lowed to use Minnesota Multi-phasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) offered by LPT Ltd., despite the fact that the copyright owner allowed its use for re-search purposes only (not for clinical diagnosis). Supporters of our campaign were collecting signatures under the letter. The culmination of our campaign was on the fourth day, when we organized open lectures, debates, and discussions in Warsaw and Wroclaw\u2014two major Polish cities and main academic centers. Effects of the Campaign Information about our campaign ap -peared in all mainstream media in Poland. It was broadcast on public radio stations, reported on nationwide TV news, in several newspapers, and on many web-sites. We collected 457 signatures (mostly from psychologists and academics) for our letter and sent it to the president of the Polish Psychological Association, Dr. Malgorzata Teoplitz-Winiewska. There were also events organized independently as an effect of our cam-paign (such as local debates, invited lectures, and conferences). Discussions were held at major universities for over three months. The issues were dis - cussed not only by psychologists but also by lawyers or people who were diagnosed by expert witnesses with in-valid tests. As a result a large national conference took place in November 2012, where renowned Polish scien-tists met with advocates of projective tests to discuss \"Conditions for the use of projection tests in psychological and forensic diagnosis.\" The PPA was one of the organizers of this conference. There were also some side-effects of our campaign. Some university stu-dents participating in our campaign were harassed by university lecturers, and some of the researchers and lec-turers involved in our actions suffered ostracism from their academic commu-nities. Several accusations of self-pro -motion against campaign organizers appeared, as expected. Despite the months since we sent the letter to the PPA, we have received no reply from this largest psychological organization. There may be lots of rea-sons why this happened, but so far 457 psychologists deeply interested in the quality of psychological diagnosis were ignored by the largest Polish associa-tion of psychologists. To sum it all up\u2014despite a few glitches we consider our campaign a success. You can certainly see a shared pattern and resemblance to the 10:23 Campaign that turned out to be a sig-nificant worldwide success for skeptical thinkers. We were strongly inspired by its authors and we thank them for this inspiration. There are a few differences between those two undertakings. The main message of our campaign was not as clear and simple as the famous \"Ho-meopathy, there's nothing in it,\" and it was much more difficult to catch the attention of the media and the public with our message. To our satisfaction, we succeeded in attaining this goal in Poland. We realize that we did not stop the use of projective techniques by psychologists, and that we still have a lot of hard work to do. But we also strongly believe that skeptical organi-zations can repeat our success in their countries. Learning from our mistakes can help us prepare better events in the future. A worldwide network of engaged skeptics is fully capable of fo-cusing public attention on pseudosci-entific claims in all areas of our lives. One of the greatest philosophers of science, Karl Popper, said: \"Science must begin with myths and with the criticism of myths.\" Psychology seems to be an infinite source of unverified myths and claims. There are many widely held beliefs that \"everyone knows are true.\" These popular beliefs are usually contradicted by psycholog-ical research, but they are still taught at many universities. We\u2014as skeptics and as psychologists\u2014can either help peo-ple with our knowledge or seduce them with unrealistic empty promises. It is our choice, but also our responsibility. We invite everybody interested in carrying out a \"Psychology Is Science, Not Witchcraft\" campaign in your coun-try to please contact Polish Skep tics Club. We will provide you with all artwork and graphic materials, and we will answer all the questions you might possibly have. You can count on our help, experience, expertise, and advice.

Veracity is taking a beating nowa- days. With the immense traffic jam on the electronic information superhigh-way most folks just give up and choose what they want to believe.

Don't be surprised if your recipi- ent ignores such admonitions as \"If you don't agree with this, delete it.\" He or she may just keep it just as a reminder of how arrogant you are. 3. Keep in mind that \"Don't send me that crap\" means little if you're sending crap yourself. 4. Don't claim things without proof as fact unless it is something so obvious it cannot be disputed. \"God wants you to vote Republican\" does not fit that description. 5.

Do not treat something as if it is, even if it comes from a preacher . . . or a politi- cian. 8. Sending an email telling a dis- senter to \"sit down and shut up\" is not the best use of the First Amendment. 9. The wisest thing a person can say is \"I don't know.\" 10.

Allen Hynek GARY P . POSNER John Franch's article \"The Secret Life of J. Allen Hynek\" (SI, January/February 2013) has re- kindled memories of my correspon- dences of yesteryear with several prom-inent UFOlogists, among them Jerome Clark and Hynek. Clark, author of such books as The UFO Encyclopedia, for many years edited the International UFO Reporter, which until its discon-tinuation in 2012 was the bimonthly magazine of the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). Some of my exchanges with Clark were quite testy. One round of letters in 1992 revolved around a defamatory ac-cusation he made in IUR about people affiliated with CSI that ultimately led to my hiring an attorney (see gpposner.com/loathsome.html). But a comment Clark had made to me years earlier came to mind as I read Franch's piece. Allan Hendry (not to be confused with Allen Hynek) was the main inves-tigator at CUFOS in the 1970s. In one of Clark's 1985 letters to me, he said, \"Hendry once told me, by the way, that in the course of his employment at CUFOS the single rudest letter that organization received was written by you.\" A couple weeks later, his next let-ter again made reference to \"the more frequent assertion (made, for example, in especially insulting fashion in the last paragraph of your January 26, 1978, let-ter to Allen Hynek) that proponents are irrational, money-grubbing publicity seekers.\" I first wrote to Hynek (two pages) in 1976, while still a UFO believer. His two-page June 1 response (see gpposner. com/Hynek-1976.pdf) begins, \"This is in reply to your kind letter of May 18th\" and ends, \"Thank you again for your letter. It is always a pleasure to correspond with someone who has his head screwed on straight. . . .\" I next wrote to him (three pages) at the end of 1977, shortly after reading his latest book, The Hynek UFO Report. His two- page January 11, 1978, response (see gpposner.com/Hynek-1978.pdf) be-gins, \"Thank you for your most excel- \"Hendry once told me, by the way, that in the course of his employment at CUFOS the single rudest letter that organization received was written by you.\" \u2014UFOlogist Jerome Clark FOLLOW UP]56 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirerlent letter of December 27th. Because you have taken the time to write in con-siderable detail, I am putting your letter ahead of the stack to acknowledge it.\" And his stack nearly reached to the stars, as a result of his involvement as a consul-tant with the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind . (Hynek had coined the \"close encounter\" classifications.) My metamorphosis from UFO believer to skeptic was chronicled in the chapter (posted at gpposner.com) that I contributed to Skeptical Odysseys (Prometheus Books, 2001). As I detail there, my next missive to Hynek was four pages in which, having just dis-covered and devoured Philip Klass's UFOs Explained, I rebutted Hynek's letter point by point. Klass (who died in 2005), senior avionics editor of Avi-ation Week magazine and one of the founders of CSI, soon thereafter wrote to me of this letter: It was 7 p.m. before I left the office, exhausted from a hard day probing a very controversial international avia-tion issue, and by a cold and hacking cough that should have sent me to bed but for the press of Aviation Week business. But your letter [to Hynek] has moved me almost to tears and so I must respond tonight and express my thanks. Soon after I entered the \"Strange Land of UFOria,\" I realized that I had undertaken a largely thankless task. That for most people, who think the whole issue is nonsense, I was on a fool's errand, while for those who are interested and who generally are \"believers,\" my efforts would evoke only harsh criticism. But your letter of Jan. 23 [to Hynek] is ample reward for all my efforts\u2014truly. What you have dared to say to the \"Galileo of UFOlogy\" [as Hynek had been dubbed in a recent issue of Newsweek] has long needed to be said. . . . You are the first, to my knowledge, to bra-zenly comment that the Emperor is NAKED! I didn't think to mention in my chapter the two-page addendum (see gpposner.com/Posner-1978.pdf) I sent Hynek three days later after seeing him on a national television program the night before. This \"rudest\" letter's \"in-sulting\" closing paragraph reads: Thanks to TV Guide, I have been able to view many of your recent TV appearances, as you well know, and have found them to be quite distressing. Even if UFOs do repre-sent a \"quantum jump\" phenomenon (and as I've said before, I hope they do), your illogical statements only serve to alienate (no pun intended) persons such as myself.

Had I known then about Hynek's \"secret life,\" I might have found myself much less vexed by the man. Incorpo-rating information revealed in Hynek's close friend and colleague Jacques Vallee's 1996 book, Franch tells of how Hynek \"had been an enthusiastic though closeted student of the occult [and], for example, believed that there were planes of existence beyond the physical, and he even endorsed alleged instances of 'psychic surgery' and 'psy-chic photography.'\" Moving on from the \"irrational\" to the \"money-grubbing publicity seeker\" (as Clark interpreted my letter), Franch quotes a Vallee journal entry: \"Media men hire Allen as they would hire a gui-tar player. He rushes wherever he sees a spotlight, and if the spotlight moves, he moves with it.\" And in a 1978 letter to a friend, Hynek boasted that \"each one of my [UFO] lectures brings me more than my monthly pay from Northwest-ern [University].\" Franch also quotes Vallee as having noted back in 1968 that \"[Hynek] is no longer taken seri - ously among astronomers.\" Thanks to my new awareness of Dr. Hynek's \"secret life,\" any subconscious guilt that I may have been harboring for decades over my notorious \"insulting\" let-ter has now certainly been vanquished.

His pre-vious books Autism's False Prophets and Deadly Choices examined the mis- information spread by the anti-vac-cine movement following Andrew Wakefield's infamous vaccine/autism study. Now he turns his attention to the field of alternative medicine with a new book, Do You Believe in Magic? The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine. He explains why alternative thera- pies are popular: mainstream doctors are perceived as uncaring and dictato-rial, offering unnatural remedies with intolerable side effects, while alternative healers provide natural remedies, com-fort, and individual attention. But he warns that \"natural\" remedies mustn't be given a free pass. Unless we hold all therapies to the same high standard of scientific proof, we risk being hood-winked by healers who believe in magic. Being a scientist, Offit's approach was to review studies of various alter-native treatments to see what worked. He found that most of them didn't, and when they did work, it was how they worked that was surprising. Offit is a wonderful storyteller who makes his message come alive. Each chapter is a story that grabs the read-er's interest and holds it. In the intro-duction, he tells us that when seven-year-old Joey Hofbauer was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, he had a 95 percent probability of cure with ra-diation and chemotherapy. His parents rejected the oncologist's recommen-dations, and with the collusion of the courts they put him under the care of a psychiatrist who gave him Laetrile, coffee enemas, a \"witch doctor's diet,\" and a mixture of other nonsensical treatments. Joey died riddled with can-cer, and yet the psychiatrist went on to treat other patients the same way. One chapter features Dr. Oz, de - scrib ing some of the believers in magic featured on his show. Another chap-ter tells the story of Linus Pauling's unfortunate infatuation with vitamin C. Another tells how diet supplement industry lobbyists and colluding pol-iticians neutered the FDA by passing the Diet Supplement Health and Ed-ucation Act, allowing the marketing of products without any prior testing for safety or efficacy. He eviscerates Su- zanne Somers for her anti-aging regi-men and Jenny McCarthy for her cru-sade against vaccines. He reveals how a nonexistent disease, Chronic Lyme Disease, was invented and popularized and how the myth continues to harm patients. He builds on Steve Jobs's flir-tation with alternative treatments for his pancreatic cancer to cover the larger story of bogus cancer cures, from shark cartilage to Krebiozen to Gerson ther-apy. A separate chapter is devoted to Stanislaw Burzynski, the \"anti-neoplas-ton\" cancer doctor who charges patients exorbitantly to be subjects in experi-ments that never seem to get published and who claims huge success rates that have never been confirmed when inde-pendent reviewers have looked at his cases. And then there's Rashid Buttar, who mistreated thousands of autistic children and cancer patients with use-less (and potentially harmful) chelation therapy; and all the medical board did was order him to provide a consent form advising patients that his treat-ments were unproven. Offit explains why alternative med- icine is so seductive and how patients and doctors can be misled by the pla- Do You Believe in Magic? HARRIET HALL Do You Believe in Magic?

Instead of railing against alternative medicine as a whole, he thinks some of it has a certain value as \"placebo medicine.\" He draws a line where alternative medicine crosses over into quackery: Recommending against conven- tional therapies that are helpful. (He mentions Andrew Weil, Joe Mercola, chiropractors, Deepak Chopra, and oth-ers as guilty of that sin.) Promoting potentially harmful ther- apies without adequate warning. Draining patients' bank accounts. Promoting magical thinking. It isn't harmless, and it encourages scientific il-literacy. The subject is one I know a lot about, so I didn't expect any surprises. Never-theless, he surprised me with back stories and intriguing details I had not known. I knew Suzanne Somers used bioidentical hormones, but I didn't know about all of the forty-seven other remedies she uses, or that she rubs glutathione into the skin over her liver to stimulate it. His explana-tion of the political machinations behind the FDA and diet supplement laws is the best I have read. He gives a wealth of interesting information while providing incisive insights into why patients and doctors do what they do. Those who are put off by the hostility of other authors toward alternative medi-cine may be receptive to Offit's approach, since he thinks there is a place for alter-native medicine (if only as placebo med-icine).

In a section titled \"The Physics of Psi\" (beginning with an admiring mention of mystic Madame Blavatsky), Targ eventually invokes quantum physics (a subject outside his field of expertise) before finally admitting that \"No one presently knows how ESP works\" (p. 204).

It's about the predictions that are possible playing dice or poker or betting on basketball games. But it's also about elections, the weather, earthquakes, the future of the planet's climate, diagnos-ing diseases, or mitigating floods. The book is a useful addition to a skep-tic's bookshelf because the procedure it describes\u2014known as Bayesian reason-ing\u2014is a basic building block of critical thinking. That said, there are better books out there on the subject, and the flaws in this one are instructive. Silver's work on the 2008, 2010, and 2012 U.S. elections made fools of the entire cacophony of \"horse race\" TV pundits. To predict which candidate will win, Silver starts with an educated guess about the likely outcome based on the broad sociopolitical climate: unemployment, income growth, candi-date quality, and so on. Then he com-bines this initial guess with polling data from multiple sources, calibrating each pollster according to how well (or how badly) they performed in the past. But rather than treating each new round of polling data as an exciting revelation of what is to come, he uses it instead to slightly adjust his guess. Then he waits for more polls. This method is quintessential Bayes. The idea is to start with a general im-pression about what's probably the case. For best results, use contextually relevant information. But even a wild stab (50/50) or an educated guess (an expert's 80/20 opinion) will do for starters. We refer to the strength of this belief as the prior. It's useful to think about the prior as a kind of bet, with a potential loss or payoff. Just how much do you believe X is true? What odds would entice you to bet against your belief? Silver doesn't mention it, but Bayesian thinking is what under-pins an axiom Carl Sagan popularized: \"Extraordinary claims require extraor-dinary evidence.\" If the probability of your prior is very low, then the improb-ability of your observation must be ex-traordinarily high to compensate. Next, you observe the phenomenon you're interested in, measuring it in a way that tells you whether you won or lost your bet. By applying some basic algebra, you combine the information in your prior with the evidence from your observation to arrive at a new level of belief called the posterior. But you don't stop there. In turn, this posterior becomes the prior for another round of betting and observation. And then an-other. . . . One of the strengths of Silver's book is the way he demonstrates the limits of this kind of reasoning. It is unreason-able to ask geologists to predict immi-nent, destructive earthquakes, Silver ex-plains, because destructive earthquakes are extremely rare, and the earth's con-stant movement makes it hard to dis-tinguish something significant from the crust's everyday flexing. In other words, prediction depends on distinguishing signal from noise. Silver also explains the perils of \"over-fitting,\" where inad-equate data chases over-precise models. So far, so good. But The Signal and the Noise isn't perfect. For starters, Sil-ver's formal treatment of the mathe-matics is idiosyncratic. His presentation meets his minimal obligation to rigor, and because it lacks the daunting mess of letters, lines, and parentheses, it's probably easier to use in simple cases. Unfortunately, readers will have a lot to relearn in the next book about Bayes they pick up. Most textbooks introduce Bayes using the notation of conditional probability, and they traditionally con-vey the underlying intuition using Venn diagrams or a lattice showing all possi-ble outcomes. Not Silver. Being an ardent Bayesian, Silver also rejects frequentism and all of its works because of weaknesses inherent in its methods. Perhaps the best known of these involves \"p values\" and what they tell us about rejecting or accepting some hypothesis. Most students learn standard experimental technique. Di-vide your subjects into control and test groups (being careful to get the sizes right). Perform some procedure on the test group. Then observe the control and test groups' outcomes.

The rub lies in the phrase \"by chance alone.\" Unlikely things happen all the time. By convention, we reject the null hypothesis when p < 0.05, which means that a falsehood has a 1 in 20 chance of being accepted. Bad enough. But what's worse is the way this \"false positive\" ef-fect can be exploited. Repeat the same experiment enough times and you're almost certain to eventually achieve any result you want, \"by chance alone.\" Silver is on solid ground here. But frequentist methods also provide tools for analyzing such data sets where Bayes is much harder to apply. In The Signal and the Noise we learn that Silver has made several careers with numbers. He's been a financial analyst, profes-sional poker player, and he's written perhaps the world's best software for predicting how well baseball pitch-ers will perform. But he's never been a working scientist. And it shows. It's true that frequentist methods can be misapplied, but Bayes is no panacea. Silver's chapter on climate change is a good example of how not to do it. After several pages of throat clearing about how strident the (nonscientific) debate is, Silver explains how recent moderation in the rate of increase in atmospheric temperature should reduce our subjective belief in the likelihood of anthropocentric climate change. He points out that the average global tem-perature in 2011 was pretty much the same as it was in 2001, where climate change theories suggest that we should bet on an increase. In selecting temperature as his proxy for climate change, Silver ignores a host of other indicators that experts in the field also consider. If increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas levels are increasing the amount of solar energy trapped by Earth's atmosphere, then in addition to temperature changes, scien-tists predict a host of other effects: bi-ological habitat changes, reduced polar ice, ocean acidification, reduced glacia-tion, increases in the number and sever-ity of \"extreme weather\" events, and so on. Silver's selection of a single measure he was familiar with doesn't allow him to consider the totality of the evidence. (Even his choice of decade was instruc-tive. Temperatures were sharply up over the decade ending in 2009.) Bayesians can be subjective about their priors, but they must be ruth-lessly objective about their evidence. A Bayesian who fails to consider all the evidence is no better than a gambler who doesn't pay up on losing bets. Fre-quentists sometimes joke that a Bayes-ian is someone who expects a duck, sees a beaver, and concludes a platypus. To use Bayes as well as Sil ver's basketball gambler it's first necessary to immerse yourself in the minutia of whatever you're trying to understand. Silver failed to do that on the topic of climate change, and in doing so, demonstrates precisely how not to apply Bayes. What makes Silver's mistake even more in-structive is that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) uses Bayesian techniques to integrate these multiple lines of evidence. Silver's book reads like it is fumbling around the edges of a great problem. Useful and mostly true, but not the last word. n Paul G.

Skeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 61REVIEWS] The Biography of America's Lake Monster BENJAMIN RADFORD Robert Bartholomew and his broth- er Paul grew up near the shores of Lake Champlain, which not only sparked an early interest in the lake monster said to dwell within the lake but also steeped them in the social and cultural context of the mysterious beastie. In his new book, The Untold Story of Champ: A Social History of America's Loch Ness Monster, Robert, a sociologist, Fortean investigator, and former broadcast journalist, takes a fresh look at Champ, long dubbed \"America's Loch Ness Monster.\" There have only been a handful of other books dealing in any depth or scholarship with Champ, among them Joe Zarzynski's Champ: Beyond the Leg- end, and of course Lake Monster Mys- teries: Investigating the World's Most Elusive Creatures, coauthored by Joe Nickell and myself. The Untold Story of Champ builds on these books and oth-ers, correcting some mistakes and put-ting the information in its social and historical context\u2014which, as I have often argued, is vitally important for truly understanding mysterious phe-nomena. Along the way, Bartholomew fills in fascinating gaps and details in the story of Champ. But Bartholomew does something that no other author has, taking us be-hind the scenes for a glimpse at the colorful personalities that have gath-ered over the years (and especially in the early 1980s when Champ fever was at its peak). The story of those who looked for Champ is just as interesting as the story of Champ itself. Famed showman and huckster P.T. Barnum makes an important appearance (offer-ing $50,000 for the monster's carcass in 1873), as do many prominent cryp-tozoologists, including Philip Reines, Loren Coleman, J. Richard Greenwell, Roy Mackal, and others who con- vened a 1981 conference titled, \"Does Champ Exist? A Scientific Seminar.\" The intrigue between and among these researchers is interesting enough to fill several chapters. There are several good books about the people involved in the search for Bigfoot, including Anatomy of a Beast: Obsession and Myth on the Trail of Big-foot by Michael McLeod, Bigfoot: The Life and Times of a Legend by Joshua Blu Buhs, and Searching for Sasquatch: Crackpots, Eggheads, and Cryptozoology by Brian Regal. But there has been comparatively little insight into the motivations and personalities of those searching for lake monsters, and this book nicely fills that gap. The book exhaustively reviews Champ sightings, both early and mod-ern. Bartholomew uncovers common myths along the way, such as that the beast was first sighted by the explorer after whom the lake was named, Sam-uel de Champlain. The best evidence for Champ, the famous 1977 photo-graph by Sandra Mansi, is presented in some detail, and the book offers new, tantalizing revelations about the circumstances of Mansi's sighting and the publication of her photograph. (See also Bartholomew's recent SI article on the Mansi photo, \"New Information Surfaces on 'World's Best Lake Mon-ster May/June 2013.) Like virtually all \"unexplained\" phe- nomena, the history of Champ is in part a history of hoaxes, and the book examines several of them in detail, in-cluding a similar story from nearby Lake George, which had its own lake monster\u2014and, of course, its own lake monster hoax. Bartholomew's book is, at its heart, a skeptical book, but its goal is not to prove or disprove the creature's existence. It is instead exactly what the subtitle announces: an objective social history of the creature covering nearly a century and half of sightings, discus-sion, and debate, informed by folklore, cryptozoology, Fortean studies, local Vermont history, skepticism, and the inevitable crackpot. Of interest to skeptics and believers alike (and accessible to both the casual mystery enthusiast and the academic re-searcher), The Untold Story of Champ is one of the best books on the subject, and it is especially recommended for those with an interest in cryptozoology. n Benjamin Radford is deputy editor of the S/K.sc/E.sc/P.sc/T.sc/I.sc/C.sc/A.sc/L.sc I/N.sc/Q.sc/U.sc/I.sc/R.sc/E.sc/R.sc and a member of the American Folklore Society.

A person such as H.G. Wells's Invisible Man would be blind! We may first consider that if the lens in each eye of the in-visible person had the same re-fractive index as air, it would not focus the image to the retina. At the very least, the person would see a blurred image. But we may go even further. We are able to see because the photons impact the photoreceptors in the retina. If all components of the eye are totally transparent, there will be no impact and no signals will be sent to the brain. Ed WysockiOrlando, FloridaIndian Astrology Jayant V. Narlikar's article \"An Indian Test of Indian Astrology\" in your March/April 2013 issue exposed the unscientific nature of the populistic ancient belief. There are certain vital points to be noted which were missed in the article. Indian astrology is based on nine planets\u2014of which four are not planets. Rahu and Ketu are the mythological planets based on Hindu tradition. They are nonexistent. The Sun is a star and not a planet and yet it is included as one of nine planets. The Moon is not a planet but is categorized as a planet. When the major premises are wrong, naturally the conclusions cannot be right. Indian astrology never stud- ied nor compared its system with astronomy. The astrologers were ignorant of the distance of stars and planets from Earth and equally ignorant of the effect of light on humans. Similarly they are ignorant of constellations. Indian astrology was chal- lenged by scientists like Pushpa P. Bhargava in the Indian Su-preme Court. The Court ex-pressed the view that since astrologers wish to study from a scientific point of view, they may be given opportunity to do so (March 2004). It was never implemented, of course. People like Abraham Ko voor, Dr. Narasimhaiah, vice chancel-lor of Bangalore Uni versity, and humanist philosopher M.N. Roy (1887-1955) challenged the claims of Indian astrologers, which go unanswered, of course. Innaiah NarisettiFormer Chairman, CFI-India Brookeville, Maryland Respect and Humility James Walker (\"Understanding Believers' Cognitive Dis sonance,\" SI, March/April 2013) makes a statement that is both highly laudable and extremely critical to the interaction between many (if not most) believers on the one hand, and the scientific and skep- tic communities on the other: \"If we merely mock or make light of a believer's beliefs, without also expressing our respect for their right to hold those beliefs . . . we will most likely drive them deeper into their mindset. While we say that we want others to re-spect our beliefs, what we really mean is that we want them to respect us as individuals.\" Herein lies the problem with \"fundamentalist\" atheists such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Bill Maher, and the late Chris-topher Hitchens: their attitudes and approaches are condescend-ing, denigrating, and dismissive. Even setting aside the mean-spir-itedness of such an attitude, it is also self-defeating: if one of the goals of the skeptic community is to get believers to learn and accept science in various areas, then condescension and den-igration will not only serve to \"drive them deeper into their mindset\" (as a general matter), but will also cause them to re-ject both science and scientists as \"the enemy.\" There are many believers who accept science in various areas (including a thir-teen-billion-year-old universe and evolution) and might well be willing to accept more (over time)\u2014if they are approached with respect and, yes, humility. But the so-called \"New Atheists\" refuse, seemingly on principle, to show any humility or respect whatsoever. Although Mr. Walker al most undermines his otherwise even-handed tone with occasional broad-brush and paternalistic asides, his overall approach is far more likely to find converts (or at least open minds) from the \"flat-Earth\" mindset than the scorched-earth approach of Mr. Dawkins et al.

Reading the March/April issue of the S I, I was struck by the breadth of subjects to which skeptics apply their critical thinking. Some are curious and interesting, such as \"Invisible Beings,\" Fly,\" but are un likely to affect most of us directly. We are more likely to be directly affected by herbal medicine, as discussed by Steven Novella in \"Herbs Are Drugs\" and in the long run by \"Quackademic Medicine\" reported by Kendrick Frazier to be infiltrating our medical schools. Even more common are the telemarketing frauds discussed by Anthony Pratkanis 62 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirer [INBOXSkeptical Inquirer | July/August 2013 63(and reported by Frazier). I hope that these frauds and the mea-sures to counteract them may be discussed in detail in a future issue of the S I. Extending further into the marketplace from outright frauds are the even more com-mon deceptions that we all are aware of and that may be used to sharpen our critical-thinking axes. Gambling in the form of lotteries, slot machines, and casinos plays upon our wish - ful thinking, although we may know that the chances of losing are greater than winning. Gam-bling has become a major in-dustry, sanctioned by states and providing from the \"sucker tax\" a major source of state revenue. David W. BriggsMarion, Massachusetts Rooting Out a Number I want to point out what is surely the least significant error in the history of the S I. In the article on the Elberfeld horses in the March/April 2013 issue, the example problem given should contain the number 4356 rather than 4536, since the former is a per-fect square while the latter is not, and so no horse, however clever, could tap out its square root. Thomas PickettEvansville, Indiana Stefano Vezzani replies: Thank you. I will correct the mis- take in the book I'm writing on the topic. Piltdown and Science Sociology In his discussion of how science works (\"The Proper Role of So-ciology of Science,\" SI, March/April 2013), Massimo Pigliucci offers Piltdown Man as an exam-ple of scientists holding untrue beliefs for nonrational reasons. Rather, I see this episode in the relatively new field of anthro-pology as an example of science working as it should. There was no reason to sus- pect this discovery was a forgery designed to lead scientists to a different trail of hominid evolu-tion. Anthropologists did their best to fit it into the framework of genuine hominid fossils they had at that time (1912). For reasons obvious to us now, they were never very successful at this and usually showed Piltdown as an offshoot of the family tree they were trying to construct. Their difficulties eventually led them to look at the fossil more critically and only then did they find it to be a clever hoax. Don KeithWaterloo, Ontario, Canada I enjoyed Massimo Pigliucci's column \"The Proper Role of So-ciology of Science,\" and agreed heartily with nearly every word of it. However, I believe the ex-amples he used to illustrate sci-entists holding beliefs for non-rational reasons (Piltdown Man and eugenics) did not illustrate his point very well. First, scien-tists accepted the Piltdown fos-sils for perfectly rational reasons. They were specifically treated to look old, they were planted with other fossils to give proper context, and the fossils were de-signed to corroborate the then current hypothesis of what an early human fossil would look like. Second, eugenics cannot be said to be a belief that is held for nonrational reasons. Scien-tifically, it would be quite sur-prising if it turned out that we could not modify the characteris- tics of human populations using selective breeding techniques, therefore it is perfectly rational to believe that eugenics could be applied for this purpose. Whether we should actually do so or not is a different and en-tirely nonscientific question. In summary, I certainly ac- cept Pigliucci's point that sci-entists often believe things for nonrational reasons; I just don't believe the examples he used were apt. Perhaps two better ex-amples might be Freudian psy-chology and N-rays. Randy RaymondAugusta, Georgia In his column on the role of sociology of science, Massimo Pigliucci criticizes the \"strong program\" of SSK (sociology of scientific knowledge) for want-ing a style of explanation that is \"symmetrical\" so that the same causes would explain true and false beliefs. James Alcock in Kendrick Frazier's account of the CSICon conference (same issue), however, noted in a ses-sion on Belief and Memory, that \"The 'feeling of knowing' is an emotion and is not tied to knowledge and may have noth-ing to do with reality.\" To this reader it seems that the SSK program wants to understand the social contributions to our \"feeling of knowing\" and so the symmetry the program looks for does not seem necessarily wrong. Everyone, whether committed to the methods of science or not, believes numerous assertions to be true, and some of every-one's beliefs are almost certainly false. Finding the social (or the neurological, for that matter) contributions to that \"feeling of knowing\" does not seem an un-reasonable undertaking. Don MartinToronto, Ontario, Canada Massimo Pigliucci replies: Don Keith and Randy Raymond are correct that the Piltdown episode is a good example of the (long-term) self-correcting mech - anism of science. But sociological factors were definitely not extra-neous to the quick initial accep-tance of the hoax. British scientists were all too happy to show that the dawn of humanity happened on British soil, for instance. So it is not accurate to say that scientists accepted the findings for entirely rational reasons. The eugenics case is more com- plex, and it is of course true that it is possible, in principle, to geneti- cally \"improve\" the human species. But I encourage interested readers to get acquainted with the history of eugenics, which did include quite a number of pseudoscientific notions, for instance related to race genetics. Don Martin's comments are interesting, but the fact remains that\u2014quite apart from \"feelings of knowing\"\u2014it is not possible to understand the scientific enter- prise if one does not include epis- temological considerations along with the sociological and psycho- logical approaches. Otherwise we would have no way to tell science apart from any pseudo-claim to knowledge. Velikovsky and the Bible It has long bemused me that the critiques of Immanuel Veli- kovsky's work (David Mor rison's review of The Pseudoscience Wars, SI, March/April 2013) have con- centrated almost exclusively on his bizarre celestial mechanics, rather than on his equally bizarre use of the sources that allowed him to posit the Venus incident. It is well known that Veli- kovsky's primary aim was to val- idate biblical accounts of such events as the parting of the Red Sea and the collapse of the walls of Jericho. Doing this would, he thought, encourage his readers to accept the remainder of the Bible as equally \"true.\" Beyond this, his modus ope - randi was simply to apply the same treatment to completely random ransackings of ancient and modern myths that could be construed as speaking of celestial and terrestrial events and that 64 Volume 37 Issue 4 | Skeptical Inquirer[LETTERS TO T HE EDI TOR are as different from one another as they are alike. To do this, he further presumed that all these myths\u2014however and wherever collected\u2014refer to the same event, which he then dated to conform to his biblical chronol-ogy. Thus, whether they realize it or not, all Velikovskians are at the same time Christian funda-mentalists as well. Any sensible (i.e., evi- dence-driven) interpretations of myth recognize that their evidence is\u2014at best\u2014multiple reified accounts that change dra-matically, but undetectably, over time and that they can have no probative value when treated as historical. Velikovsky's wildly uncritical use of such ahistorical sources is sufficient of itself to undermine his further allegations that have attracted so much attention. At its source, it's really nothing more than another pedestrian demonstration of the Garbage In, Garbage Out theorem. David HenigeMadison, Wisconsin David Morrison replies: I agree with much of Henige's letter. But Gordin in his book, and I in my review, emphasized pseudoscience, with Velikovsky as an example. So many people focus solely on Velikovsky and ignore the larger picture. I do disagree with Henige's second paragraph. I have never seen evidence that this was Ve-likovsky's motive or intent. I am contacting Michael Gordin to ask if he agrees. Velikovsky was a sec-ular Zionist in the European tra-dition. And he certainly was not a Christian, so it seems weird to think that he accepted the remain-der of the Bible as \"true.\" Michael D. Gordin, author of The Pseudoscience Wars, replies: I agree completely with David. Not only was Velikovsky not a Christian fundamentalist, he was rather hostile to Christian funda-mentalists, and one can easily ob-serve this in his engagement with creationists, which I detail in Chapter 5 of my book. The larger point, however, is about whether Velikovsky thought that his pur-pose was to get people to accept the Bible as true. Although it is clear that for him the biblical evidence was extremely important, both his own narratives and those avail-able from his reading notes, mar-ginalia, etc., show that part of the reason he found specific episodes in the Bible to be credible is that they correlated with other ancient mythological evidence. The let - ter-writer might just as well have said that Velikovsky's goal was to substantiate the Vedas, which I doubt is the direction he would go. Perpetual Motion Re: \"Perpetual Discussion!\" by Mark Levy (Forum, SI, March/April 2013). While the gist of his article properly denounced perpetual motion as pseudoscience, Mark Levy committed what Terence Hines, two articles later, calls \"one howling error.\" The Dean patent had nothing whatever to say about perpetual motion or running without an energy input. It was entirely a method of converting mechanical mo - tion from one form to another as the patent's title says, in the same category as a crankshaft converting reciprocating motion to rotary motion. The drawing itself shows a power input shaft on the right (20-21-22). I remember the Dean-ma- chine story well. John Camp-bell, the legendary editor of Analog (maybe it was still called Astounding then) featured it prominently, and proposed it as a spaceship drive. I think it even got a cover illustration that month. Dean's demonstration model used an electric drill as a power source for rotary motion, as I recall. A high-school friend and I mocked up a crude model of the device and found that it did produce some detectable output thrust, as Dean described, but the spinning weights that pro - duced the thrust (14 and 16) had to be of the same order of magnitude (mass) as the load the device was to lift, which would have made the whole thing im-practically heavy and bulky for the heavy lifting that Dean and Campbell proposed. Dead-end device though it may have been, it does not be-long in the swamp of perpetu-al-motion gadgets, and Dean deserves an apology. Ken MosesStillwater, Minnesota Whatever else N.L. Dean may have intended in his \"Con-verting Rotary Motion into Uni-directional Motion\" machine, it had nothing to do with \"Perpet-ual Motion.\" Mr. Levy should do a bit more re search next time. Paul WeberAlbuquerque, New Mexico Mark Levy's excellent article was slightly marred by a small error in the explanation of the perpet-ual motor. It is quite possible that the error lay in the patent rather than Mark's explanation. Points: 1) the bellows cannot remove \"all the air\" from the bulb. Not even a good vacuum Point of Inquiry , named a top-ten podcast by Business Insider , is where the brightest minds of our time sound off on all the things you're not supposed to talk about at the dinner table: sci-ence, religion, society, and politics. Chris Mooney, author of The Republican Brain and The Republican War on Science, and neuro- scientist (and opera singer) Indre Viskontas engage in pointed and critical conversations with leading scientists, philosophers, social critics, and entertainers. Previous guests include Brian Greene, Susan Jacoby, Richard Dawkins, Ann Druyan, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Eugenie Scott, Adam Savage, Bill Nye, Lawrence Krauss, and many more! www.pointofinquiry.orgpump could do that. 2) The buoyancy of the bulb is due to the difference in its \"den- sity\" and the density of water. A vacuum-filled bulb would be less dense and have greater buoyancy. Forcing compressed air into the bulb would make it sink. The bellows compress the air. Google for Cartesian diver experiment. Robert R. \"bz\" Zinn Programmer (retired) Department of Chemistry, LSU Baton Rouge, Louisiana Herbs as Food Steven Novella (\"Herbs Are Drugs,\" SI, March/April 2013) says that \"Herbs have . . . the same potential for side effects and toxicity as any drug.\" But this is not true in the case where the herb in question is in wide-spread use as an herb. If I eat a certain quantity of garlic be-cause I think it provides some health benefit, I'm no more likely to experience an adverse effect than if I eat that same quantity of garlic because I like the taste. Since we don't ad - vise people to avoid garlic as a flavoring for fear of adverse ef-fects, we shouldn't advise them to avoid it as a remedy for that reason. (We might tell them it's useless as a remedy, but that's a different issue.) I would find the rest of what Dr. Novella says more credible if he would distinguish between common foodstuffs and unusual and po-tentially dangerous plants. Ken OlumSharon, Massachusetts When Certificates Get Dates Wrong Ben Radford's S I- column on the Adam Lanza birth certificate, and the likelihood its wrong date is due to a simple typo (\"Sandy Hook School Shooting: The Adam Lanza Death Certificate Con-spiracy,\" SI, May/June 2013) rang very true with me. Here's why. My son was born April 7, 1989, in King's Daugh-ters Hospital, Temple, Texas. When we received his birth certificate, however, it listed the date of birth as April 4. Well, that's easily explained; someone wrote down the correct 4-7-89 at some point and when it was re-entered they just entered a 4 followed by another 4 instead of the correct 7. Like your example with the daughter of a friend, three days was no big deal, but who knew what problems might come along in the next week or in twenty or forty years. So I de-cided I'd get it changed to the correct date. We called the hospital, which informed us we'd have to get it changed by the state because it was now part of their records. So I drove to Austin and went to the appropriate state agency. They told me it was a county or city records issue and I would need to go to the Bell County Clerk in Belton or the City of Temple. So, I drove to Temple and went to City Hall. Where I was told the city did indeed have the birth certif-icate for my son who was born on April 4. I told them that was what I was there to correct. They said I needed to go to the hospital. Which I did. At the hospital I was told they couldn't change an official government document, and they suggested I contact the city. At this point I was pretty frustrated (as you can imagine) but I did decide to go back to Temple City Hall one more time. Where I lucked out, met one of these competent long-time employees without whom nothing would ever get done in a bureaucracy. She listened to my story, delivered herself of a few choice opinions on medical records staffs, called the hospi-tal, identified herself, made a few pointed comments, hung up, and turned to me with a smile, \"Their internal records have the birth in three separate places, all showing April 7,\" she said. The city changed the date. So did the state. I wrote a col-umn about the lady, who was about to retire, and at the next city council meeting, the City of Temple honored her for her dedication to public service. Occam's Razor indeed. Mike BrownEditorRockdale ReporterRockdale, Texas These Wonderful Articles I've finally gotten a moment to spend with my first SI, and what a waste my waiting time has been. Why did I wait so long to sit down and read these wonderful articles? Why did I not stop everything right away and give the magazine a good reading? I don't know, but it will not happen again. The ar-ticles were all so well written, and all very interesting. I en-joyed how well researched the topics were. I loved the refer-ence section, and all the APA style in-text citations. Nothing says upfront, honest, and care-fully examined like in-text cita-tions and a reference page. I enjoyed \"Indignation Is Not Righteous\" a great deal. The writ-ing was great\u2014the authors clearly defined the terms that leave no reader confused. Of course short articles like the \"Bees\" held great appeal to me as well. Brevity is not only the soul of wit but the mark of a clear argument. Thank you so much for your work, and all the work of the authors\u2014they spend many hours reading, researching, and documenting so that we can have better articles and a better un-derstanding of the issues. I'm so glad I watched that episode of Is it Real . . . which led me to this publication.
