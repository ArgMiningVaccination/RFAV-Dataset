Acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine are used to diagnose and treat any imbalances in the body. This is done by observing the patient's tongue and palpating the different pulses. Any 'energetic imbalances' detected can then be treated for healing and to prevent progression of one's current condition. Acupuncture has been around for over 4,000 years. It has stood the test of time and is used to help people in more and more ways every day. Today in China, it is used side by side with Western medicine. In comparison to Western medicine where your doctor monitors the blood flowing through your arteries and veins, acupuncturists monitor your qi (pronounced \"chee\"), or energy, that flows through your meridians, or channels, to assess the state of your whole \"energetic system.\" This energetic system courses through and over your entire body. The human body has 14 meridians, six of which are connected to the major organs and run from head to toe on both sides of the body. By placing the needles at various locations on the body, one's energy can be adjusted and overall health can be improved. The qi in your body must not be in deficiency or excess. It must be flowing properly to nourish all the aspects of one's being. If one's energy is balanced and flowing freely, one can then experience optimal levels of health. The first visit usually lasts about one hour to an hour and a half. A full evaluation is included, with a complete history, exam, and treatment. Other therapies that may be incorporated into your treatment include moxibustion, electro-acupuncture, acupressure, and/or specific qigong exercises. Most people who have had acupuncture describe it as virtually painless or far less painful than being pinched on the arm. Once a needle is inserted, the patient may experience a warm sensation, tingling, vibration, slight numbness/achiness, or an electric like sensation near or distant to the site of insertion. All needles used are sterile, disposable and single-use only. Non-needle qigong energy treatments are also available. When performed by a licensed acupuncturist, it is quite safe and effective, without adverse or addictive side effects. One positive attribute is that sometimes problems other than the one for which you are being treated may also resolve or improve. This shows how balancing one's energy can affect one's overall health. No. While having a positive state of mind helps with any type of treatment, conventional or otherwise, it is not necessary to \"believe\" in acupuncture for it to work. Most patients would describe it as \"relaxing.\" Sometimes the effects are too subtle to perceive, especially in the beginning of the treatment, yet patients usually leave in less discomfort and are more functional than when they arrived. Acupuncture is recognized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to be effective in the treatment of a wide variety of medical problems.
