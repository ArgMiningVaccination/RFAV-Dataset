The programme offers behavioural support in a fun, educational and non-judgmental manner. Participation in the course is voluntary. The aim for young people attending the programme is to quit smoking. The programme uses evidence-based competencies for the delivery of a stop smoking intervention, which can be applied to those who wish to quit vaping. Please note that while we have confidence in the underpinning evidence in terms of what works to support smoking cessation we do not have access to robust evidence in the cessation of vaping. However, while behavioural support for quitting smoking and medicines for managing nicotine withdrawal have not been developed or tested for stop vaping use, first principles would suggest that they could be useful as a stop vaping aid. We know these medicines have a well-established safety profile, and behavioural supports and techniques for addiction and health behaviour change have been applied successfully to multiple health behaviours. This book provides you with a systematic approach for facilitating Quit4Youth. The structure of the programme focuses ultimately on supporting a young person to become tobacco/nicotine free but is based on a holistic model whereby each week a different health topic is addressed. Promoting healthy behaviours among young people is a key component of this programme. Whilst the basis for this course is about supporting nicotine addiction withdrawal, the programme also looks at other health behaviours such as managing stress, physical activity and healthy eating. It also allows young people to explore the wider societal issues of smoking and vaping, for example, impact on the environment, manipulation of the tobacco industry and looking at ways of promoting smoke free environments. The methodology for health education and promotion used in this programme includes group work, games, icebreakers, role-play, buzz groups, moving debates and peer education. How to use this book? Section 1 describes the background to the course and how to use this resource. Please read in full before proceeding or before planning to deliver a course. Section 2 contains session plans for the Information Session and the seven-week programme. Section 3 contains additional activities that you may wish to use instead of or in addition to the activities provided in the weekly sessions. Section 4 contains additional information for the facilitators to support your own understanding and knowledge of specific topics. Section 5 is the appendices, which contain some supporting resources to help you with the logistics of delivering the course. You should review all sections before planning a course. Participant Handouts There are participant handouts for each session, which are available online: https:/ /www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/tobaccocontrol/resources/ They should be downloaded and printed in advance of each session. See the weekly session plans to identify the appropriate handouts for that session.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 3Background In the Irish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Study 20181 children were asked about their smoking behaviour, including one question examining the use of e-cigarettes.2 This study examines a range of health behaviours among 10 to 17 year olds in Ireland. Here are some of the results: Ever smoked tobacco Overall, 11% of children report that they have ever smoked (16% in 2014). Older children are more likely to report ever smoking. There are no significant differences across gender or social class groups. Current smoking status (defined as smoking tobacco monthly or more frequently).Overall, 5% of children report that they are current smokers (8% in 2014). Younger children and those from higher social class groups are less likely to report that they are current smokers. There are no significant gender differences. Ever used e-cigarettes Overall, 22% of children (12-17 years old) report that they have ever used e-cigarettes (new question, no 2014 data). Boys and older children are more likely to report that they have ever used e-cigarettes. There are no significant differences across social class groups. Used e-cigarettes in the last 30 daysOverall, 9% of children (12-17 years old) report that they have used e-cigarettes in the last 30 days (new question, no 2014 data). Boys and older children are more likely to report that they have used e-cigarettes in the last 30 days. There are no significant differences across social class groups. In 2019, the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (EPSAD) carried out a national survey on e-cigarette use among 15-16 year olds. The table on the next page shows some of the figures collected in that survey. 1 https:/ /www.nuigalway.ie/hbsc/hbscireland/2018study/ 2 The data from the 2022 report was not available at time of print. You can find all the reports for Ireland at https:/ /www.nuigalway.ie/hbsc TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 e-cigarettes 39% had tried e-cigarettes. This is an increase from the 2015 survey where 23% had reported ever using e-cigarettes. Current users of e-cigarettes (defined as using an e-cigarette monthly or more frequently)18% reported themselves as current users. Used e-cigarettes in the last 30 days16% reported using an e-cigarette in the last 30 days. Reasons for using e-cigarettes 66% said that it was out curiosity. 29% said it was because their friends offered it. Only 3% said that it was to stop smoking. The results of these studies show that e-cigarettes are popular among youth in Ireland. The ESPAD survey noted an increase in the number of students reporting use of e-cigarettes in 2019 compared to 2015. It also observed that the use of e-cigarettes among this age group (15-16 years) is now more common than cigarette smoking. The implications for future smoking is unknown but nicotine addiction seems set to continue. There is a need for a more large scale and comprehensive study on e-cigarette use among young people. Addressing the issue of quitting smoking and vaping with young people is not easy. Quit4Youth is a resource that gives guidance and support for those working with young people to help them quit. It provides insight into a sensitive issue. It will hopefully encourage many young people to make informed choices about their health. Quit4Youth is suitable for use in youth and youth education or training settings. Quit4Youth is the culmination of a process, which included engaging and working with young people, teachers and youth workers. It also incorporates recommendations on e-cigarettes as detailed in the National Clinical Guidelines3 , and Health Research Board4 reports on tobacco use and e-cigarette use among young people. It is hoped that this resource will be used as one aspect of a multi-strand approach in addressing the issue of smoking and vaping among young people. Who delivers/facilitates the programme? This programme is co-facilitated, led by a HSE Stop Smoking Advisor and supported by a youth worker or any other person appropriately placed in the youth setting. The Youth worker is best placed to manage the recruitment of participants, organise the weekly set up of the room, whilst also supporting group engagement during the weekly sessions. 3 https:/ /www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/tobaccocontrol/national-clinical-guidelines/ 4 https:/ /www.hrb.ie/ TFI/Pub 7 Revision HQS0150 5Why a programme for young people? There are two aspects to dealing with tobacco and e-cigarette use that need to be addressed: smoking/vaping prevention and stop smoking/vaping support. However, it is not within the scope of this programme to address both prevention and cessation. For this reason, Quit4Youth has been designed as a stop smoking/vaping support programme. A range of social personal and health education lesson plans, videos, tools and resources have been developed for children aged 12-16 years as part of the Social Personal and Health Education curriculum.5 The overall aim is to explore some of the reasons why young people smoke/vape and examine some of the ways to avoid smoking/vaping. These lessons while originally designed for the in school setting could also be used in youth groups and other out of school youth settings to support awareness and prevention of tobacco and e-cigarette use among youth. A social influence approach, mass media campaigns, restrictions on smoking in schools and public places, strongly enforced limits on youth access, a complete ban on tobacco advertising, and real price increases in cigarettes, have resulted in decreased numbers of youth smoking, as per the pattern of findings from the HBSC surveys. However, the promotion and increased use of e-cigarettes among the general population is threatening the gains we have seen in recent years in youth initiation of tobacco. A single programme cannot solve all of the issues associated with youth smoking and vaping. Tobacco and e-cigarette use in young people is a challenging area that requires a wide-ranging approach and this group format designed to provide stop smoking/vaping support is only one facet of it. Since Quit4Youth was originally designed, e-cigarettes have become more popular, resulting in more young people being exposed to the potential risk of nicotine addiction. Although e-cigarettes may be less harmful; albeit, not harmless; than tobacco use, they promote addictive behaviours and there is growing research that they act as a gateway to tobacco smoking6 . Research in this area is ongoing and theories around best practice are still in development. Most of the current data points to the effectiveness of a multicomponent package of support that would include interventions such as intensive support (either group or one-to-one), self-help materials and resources, brief advice offered via telephone or electronic media, social support, and monitoring and tracking. Quit4Youth embraces all of these elements with a focus on providing behavioural support to quit in a non-judgmental, friendly and safe group environment. This version has been developed to include information on and support to quit e-cigarettes, in addition to cigarettes containing tobacco. 5 For more information and a link to the lesson plans please see: https:/ /www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/healthwellbeing/hse-education-programme/junior-cycle-sphe-training-resources/healthy-choices/ 6 O'Brien D., Long J., Lee C., McCarthy A. & Quigley J. 2020 \"Electronic cigarette use and tobacco cigarette smoking initiation in adolescents. An evidence review\"TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 6How does it work? This programme is designed to influence motivated young tobacco and e-cigarette users to quit in a non-judgmental manner. It provides a structured format that incorporates relevant information, coping strategies and decision-making exercises to help young people to change. It advises on nicotine addiction and use of medication (under physician supervision for minors under 18) to support nicotine withdrawal where required as per best practice guidelines. Why work in a group? The nature of the group work adds to the learning experience for the young people involved. Group dynamics and a supportive environment can be a valuable learning tool, especially at this critical age where adolescents may feel isolated or unable to discuss these issues in other settings. Self-analysis and problem sharing inherent in the group setting will have long-term benefits as well. Emphasis is placed on how their own current choices determine how successful their attempts to change will be. At the very least the young participants will start to become aware of how to make appropriate behaviour changes regarding lifestyle issues such as tobacco and e-cigarette use and the knowledge gained from the group should help them in future situations. The bottom line It is important to remember that you are not the expert! What that means is that the participants in your group are the experts about their own lives. This is known as the person-centred approach. It is vital for effective communication when trying to help people change a particular behaviour. It requires you to remain non-judgmental towards the participants and to accept that change will only occur when the person is ready. He, she or they might already have the answer to the problem, but may or may not be in a position to act upon it yet. In this respect, it puts the onus of change onto the person and not the facilitator. Therefore, your role is to facilitate the process of change, not to actually change the person yourself. Use the group setting as an opportunity to introduce the process of change to the young people. Some will quit, but if not, do not feel too disheartened. The ability to change one's behaviour is a learned process, which takes effort and experience. Remember that the first step is to plant the seed of positive change and if the person is ready, it will happen. TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 7Getting started: How to set up the group To recruit for a group, you can use a combination of the following approaches. The person working in the youth setting is best placed to oversee and manage this part of the programme delivery. Information session Running an information session prior to running a group is an excellent way to recruit participants. It gives potential participants an overview of the content of the stop smoking/ vaping group and lets them know in advance what commitment is expected. It should also allay any fears or worries they may have. This is also an opportunity to gain parental consent. Noticeboards Be sure that these are distributed as widely as possible. Posters Remember the importance of creativity and make them as lively and interesting as possible so that they stand out from other posters. You could make it an activity to design a poster or leaflet. Talking to young people You may know which young people would be interested in joining already, so a tactful word may be all that is needed. Peer assistance in recruiting new participants can be invaluable. Young people who previously attended the course can be advocates for recruitment. Youth group website or intranet If a website or social media page already exists, then this is an obvious choice for getting the word out. Link in with local secondary schools, if appropriate to do so, and ask them to promote the course. Social media communication platforms such as WhatsApp or Snapchat The choice of communication platforms is changing all the time. Find out what platform the young people in your community are using, and use it if you have the available resources and your policy allows. Email Emails might be another option for communication. TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 8How to maintain the group The most important thing when encouraging young people to keep attending stop smoking/ vaping sessions is to make them fun and enjoyable. A group that is fun is more likely to be well attended, more likely to be spoken about to peers and information that is imparted in a fun and humorous way is more likely to be remembered after the group has finished. Group differences There is a tried and tested formula for adult stop smoking groups and yet adolescent groups seem to vary much more in what works and what does not. What goes well with one group will not necessarily hit its mark with another. So being creative and constantly ready to conjure up another method of delivering your message is essential. This is where the co-facilitation of the Stop Smoking Advisor and the Youth Worker is most valuable. Facilitating an effective group The key elements for facilitating an effective group are: 1. The provision of a safe space for individuals to share, learn and receive support. 2. The creation of an enjoyable and positive atmosphere. 3. The facilitation of learning and skill development. Provision of group support Establish the Group agreement. Devolve responsibility - group members should take on practical responsibility such as time keeping and decisions about group activities. Balance group and individual needs - generalise from particular comments, or invite wider discussion. Encourage contributions from everyone - ask people to work in pairs or smaller groups. The less you talk the more the people interact. Positive and enjoyable atmosphere Boost confidence - it will be hard to stop smoking and vaping, so boosting confidence is a central task. People often lose motivation at some point so it also helps if they look forward to the weekly sessions. Create a welcoming atmosphere - young people value an open, accepting and positive attitude. Emphasise immediate benefits of change- the effects of smoking or vaping are important but may seem too distant or too unpleasant to think about. Vary activities - mix pair/group activities and more serious/lighter topics.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 9Learning and skill development Be aware of individual needs e.g. low literacy skills, problems with hearing, vision or language. Take guidance from the person on how best to help. Take notice of body language - group members may be confused, bored or uncomfortable. Make changes as needed. Balance new information and discussion time. See problems as challenges - encourage a group response to the solving of specific problems. Link contributions and sum up key points. Be flexible with the format - if the group want to discuss stress before nutrition then go with it and find ways to link in the different topics.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 10Preparation Checklist: Before you start your group, ensure you have the following available: A suitable and accessible room/venue Computers with Internet access Week 3 activities are based around media influences and would benefit from access to the Internet during the session, but it is not mandatory. Carbon monoxide monitor A carbon monoxide (CO) monitor is needed for each session and is an excellent motivational tool for young people. CO monitors are made by a UK company (www.bedfont.com) and can be purchased in Ireland from www.medivent.ie . Your first order will come with all the necessary accessories (reusable D piece, disposable mouthpieces and disinfectant wipes). These can then be purchased as individual items as required.

Explain that because e-cigarettes do not contain carbon monoxide, e-cigarette users only, will not need to complete this test. You could consider using the cotinine saliva test for those who are using e-cigarettes. Explain what the COBT readings mean. Scores are recorded weekly in Handout 1C - this handout should be kept by the facilitator and given to the participant when the course is finished. NOTE: keep readings confidential. If the young person wishes to share with the group, that is their decision. Give participants a copy of the Handout 1D and ask them to think about where they are on the stages of change. Handout 1C: My personal carbon monoxide chart Handout 1D: Stages of change CO Monitor and accessories Why quit and the benefits of quittingThe young people can look back at the \"My Smoking and/or Vaping Quiz\". Allow the young people to explore their own reasons for starting in the first instance, why they continue, and why they want to quit. Using Facilitator Activity 2 and Facilitator Information 2, have a discussion about their smoking and vaping, why they started, why they want to quit, the benefits of quitting and the addiction involved in both tobacco use and e-cigarettes use. Alternatively, you can draw the outline of a body on flipchart paper. List the health risks relative to each part of the body of smoking/vaping. This can be done in small groups or as one large group. Following the discussion, give the young people a copy of Handout 1E.

Allow for discussion if the young people wish to share or add to the statements.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 20 Facilitator Information 1: Group Agreement The purpose of the Group Agreement is to set the tone for the programme. It helps the group to work in a safe, enjoyable, effective and creative way. Introduce the exercise as a Group Agreement that will help everyone to participate Invite the group to identify things that would help the group to work well - do not single out any one person at this stage as you are still getting to know the group and the individuals in it Write up the contributions on a flip chart and display them in the room that day. Tell the group that it will be displayed every week The Group Agreement can be added to and amended as the weeks progress Clarify any ambiguous items on the Group Agreement, in particular around confidentiality and privacy Group agreement - examples Items that should be included: Confidentiality - this means that what people say within the group is not repeated outside the group. However, it is ok to speak about what was covered, the activities themselves or the person's own contribution but not name individuals and relay their feedback or contribution outside of the group. Privacy - some people may not want to speak to other group members outside the group setting, for example, they may not have told their friends that they are attending \"I statements\" - each person is encouraged to speak in the first person e.g., \"I think that..., as opposed to \"everyone says that...\" Participation - each member of the group is encouraged to take part at their own pace and level Listening to each other - or \"one person speaks at a time\" to ensure that everyone is heard, not judged, and that what they say is valued Personal responsibility - each participant is responsible for their own learning and progress Time keeping - encourage good time keeping by finishing and starting on time and sticking to break times. If people are late, welcome them to the group and carry on Note: You can ask the group to sign the group agreementTFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 21 Facilitator Activity 2: Discussion Lead a group discussion on the health risks, financial issues and social aspects of smoking to reinforce different reasons for quitting. Use the following questions to facilitate this discussion: Why did you start smoking or vaping? What are the risks to your health associated with smoking cigarettes or using e-cigarettes? How much money do you spend on cigarettes or e-liquids? Who do you usually smoke or vape with? What are benefits of quitting smoking or vaping? Do you know any of the short term or long-term effects of smoking or vaping? Does this bother you right now? Is this is something that you have thought about before? When do you think you will start to see these benefits? Why do you want to quit? Give the young people space and time to think about and answer the questions. Optional/Alternative activity: You can make this activity more interactive by drawing the outline of a body on flipchart paper. The young people can then list or write the health risks of smoking or vaping to the relative part of the body. This can be done in small groups or as one large group. Examples: Smoking Vaping Yellow fingers Bad breath Yellow teeth Dull skin and wrinkles on skin Taste and smell are less sensitive Coughing Shortness of breath Cancer 8 Heart disease Increased heart rate Poor circulation Increased risk of stroke Weaker muscles Slower recovery from illness Increased risk of diabetes Asthma attacks Heart and lung disease (cardiovascular) Coughing Difficulty breathing Cancer Poisoning Burns Blast injuries Asthma attacks Lung damage 8 Smoking can increase the risk for a large number of cancers including lung, oesophageal, throat, mouth, larynx, cervical, etc.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 22 Facilitator Information 2: Benefits of quitting smoking & vaping The most important thing that you can do for your health is to quit smoking and vaping. You will see changes now and it will make a difference to you later in life. Cigarettes and e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which is addictive. No matter how old you are, you reduce your risk of getting serious disease when quit. The sooner you stop, the greater the benefit. Everyone knows you feel better when you give up smoking/vaping and overcome an addiction. Benefits of quitting smoking Whiteness of teeth returns Reduce the risk of tooth loss Smell and taste returns Reduces bad breath No more hairy tongue Reduced risk of gum disease Heart rate decreases Improved fitness - able to breath better Improved concentration levels and better able to study and or work Less waste and better for the environment Benefits of quitting vaping 9 Nicotine will no longer have control of your life You are less likely to start/return to smoking tobacco Your vaping will no longer be a bad influence on younger brothers, sisters and friends Nicotine can harm the developing adolescent brain. The brain keeps developing until about age 25. Stopping vaping can prevent harm to the developing brain Using nicotine in adolescence can harm the parts of the brain that control attention, learning, mood, and impulse control. You will be able to concentrate, learn and manage your emotions much better when you are nicotine free Each time a new memory is created or a new skill is learned, stronger connections - or synapses - are built between brain cells. Young people's brains build synapses faster than adult brains. Nicotine changes the way these synapses are formed. Becoming nicotine free helps develop normal brain connections 9 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: https:/ /www.cdc.gov/TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 23 Using nicotine in adolescence may also increase risk for future addiction to other drugs so quitting will help prevent your risk of other addictions We still don't know the long term effect that e-cigarettes will have on your health, but we do know that their use is associated with: Poisonings Burns Blast injuries Lung injury and Asthmatic attacks 10 Some of the chemicals in e-cigarettes are thought to cause tissue and cell damage and some are agents that may cause cancer in the long-term. Other benefits to stopping smoking/vaping Your smoking will no longer be a bad influence on younger brothers, sisters and friends You will have more money You will feel good about yourself Cigarettes and e-cigarettes will no longer control your life You will have more energy to play sports or keep fit and it will increase your performance Improved overall health in the short term and the long term - reducing the risks of cancer, lung and heart diseases. 10 HRB Press Release October 2020: https:/ /www.hrb.ie/news/press-releases/single-press-release/article/new-health-research-board- 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 24 Facilitator Information 3: True or False Quiz Answers What do we know about cigarettes and e-cigarettes? True or false 1. In Ireland, the tobacco industry needs to recruit 50 new smokers every day in order to maintain their profit margins. True This is due to the loss of lifelong smokers who die (6,000 people in Ireland each year) and those who quit. 2. In Ireland there are more quitters than smokers True Ireland now has more quitters than smokers. See the latest publication of Healthy Ireland for an updated prevalence rate. 3. Smoking fewer than ten cigarettes a day is not harmful to health False All cigarettes are bad for your health. Even light smokers have a significant increased risk of premature death and ill health compared to non-smokers. 4. E-cigarettes contain harmful chemicals True Nicotine: a highly addictive substance that negatively affects adolescent brain development Carcinogens- chemicals known to cause cancer, including acetaldehyde and formaldehyde Acrolein - a herbicide primarily used to kill weeds, can cause irreversible lung damage Diacetyl - a chemical linked to a lung disease known as popcorn lung Diethylene glycol - a toxic chemical used in antifreeze that is linked to lung disease Heavy metals such as nickel, tin, lead Cadmium - a toxic metal found in traditional cigarettes that causes breathing problems and disease Benzene - found in car exhaust Ultrafine particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs 5. Smokers who stop smoking can never repair the damage done to their bodies. False As soon as you quit smoking, your body starts to heal and your health improves. Here are some of the examples of what happens to your body after you quit smoking: After 20 minutes, your circulation will improve, and your blood pressure and heart rate will get lower. This immediately reduces your risk of a heart attack. After 8 hours, the nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in your blood go down, and the oxygen level rises. After 48 hours, the nicotine and carbon monoxide have left your body. Your sense of smell and taste will start to improve. After 72 hours, your breathing will improve and your energy levels will increase.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 25 After 2-3 months, your lung capacity could increase by up to 30%. After 1 year, your chance of having a heart attack drops by half. After 5 years, the risk of smoking-related cancers is greatly reduced. After 10 years, the risk of lung cancer is reduced by half. After 15 years, the risk of having a heart attack is the same as a non-smoker. 6. Young people who smoke before exercising will generally perform equally as well as non-smokers False Young people who smoke have decreased physical fitness levels. Smoking affects your sports performance because it reduces the amount of oxygen you can get to your muscles - you won't be able to exercise as well or for as long. 7. Second-hand smoke is tobacco smoke inhaled by a non-smoker True Second-hand smoke is the smoke you breathe out, and the smoke from the lit end of the cigarette. A smoker only inhales about 15% of the smoke from a cigarette - the other 85% is absorbed into the atmosphere or inhaled by others. 8. Coughs and colds are more common in children whose parents smoke True Children are especially vulnerable to second-hand smoke because they breathe more rapidly and their lungs, airways and immune system are still developing. 9. There are over 7000 harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke True Examples of some of the chemicals found in cigarettes are: Nicotine: found in pesticide Methane: found in sewer gas Ammonia: found in toilet cleaner Hexamine: found in barbeque lighters Acetone: found in Carbon monoxide: in car exhausts Arsenic found in rat poison Cadium found in batteries Polonium-219 which is a radioactive substance and Tar 10. Rollies (Roll your own tobacco) are less harmful than conventional pre-rolled cigarettes False Researchers have found that rollies can be often worse for you than smoking regular cigarettes. Many smokers do not use a filter, and researchers have found that the tobacco in rollies have higher levels of nicotine, tar, and cancer causing chemicals than in regular cigarettes. TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 2611. Children of non-smokers are less likely to become smokers themselves True Children who grow up in households where smoking is not the norm are less likely to smoke themselves. Children who grow up seeing their parents smoke are 3 times more likely to smoke when they grow up. 12. Every cigarette reduces a person's life expectancy by 11 minutes True Every cigarette you smoke shortens your lifespan by about 11 minutes. That is according to British researchers who calculated the effect of a lifetime of smoking with the number of cigarettes generally smoked in a lifetime. The average came out to 11 minutes. 13. Stopping smoking is the greatest single step a person can take to improve their health True Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in Ireland with almost 6,000 smokers dying each year from tobacco related diseases. Smoking related deaths are mainly due to cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and heart disease. Quitting smoking is the single best thing that a person can do to improve their health. The earlier you quit, the better the long- term health impact. 14. Vaping or using e-cigarettes will ensure that I never smoke tobacco False Research has shown that young people who use and e-cigarette are 3 to 5 times more likely to start smoking. 15. E-cigarettes have been shown to be more effective than Nicotine replacement therapies in helping people to quit smoking. False There is no evidence that e-cigarettes are better than licenced medications, such as nicotine replacement therapies to help people quit tobacco use 16. There are no risks to my health if I only use e-cigarettes. False E-cigarettes are linked to a number of health risks such as poisonings, burns, fractures, lung injury and exacerbations of asthma. They also contain known carcinogens, which can cause cancer in later life. There is growing evidence that they may also affect cardiovascular health. 17. The tobacco industry has been shown to deliberately market their products to young people. True The tobacco industry needs young people to start smoking or vaping in order to maintain their sales and profits. Publicly, the tobacco industry has always claimed that it does not use advertising to get young people smoking. However, documents from the tobacco industry that once were confidential and are now public reveal that they see recruitment of under 18s to smoking as essential. The tobacco industry also owns most of the e-cigarettes brands, which many people believe to be deliberately marketing towards young people. They have developed flavours and devices that appeal to young people.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 27Week 2 - Planning Aim: To plan for the quit date and determine participants' readiness to quit. Objectives Increase individual motivation to quit smoking by recording individual CO levels Assess readiness to quit Explore relationship with smoking and vaping Provide information on stop smoking medications, how to use and guidelines for safe use - Young people under the age of 18 will need to speak to their GP if they wish to use any of the NRT products. Champix and Zyban are only available to those over 18. Any decision to use nicotine replacement for quitting smoking or vaping would need to be made in consultation with the young person, their parent or guardian and the medical practitioner. Identify ways of dealing with cravings and withdrawal symptoms Know the 4 D's and how to incorporate them to deal with withdrawal/side effects Overview Measuring nicotine dependency Pharmacological aids to quit What will it feel like when I quit smoking/vaping Managing stress and stressful situations - the 4 D's Resources Attendance sheet & space to record quit date (if not next week) CO monitor and accessories Handout 1C - \"My personal carbon monoxide chart\" for each participant Flipchart Group agreement from week 1 Sample medications (if available) Other: _________________________________________________________________________ TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 28Week 2 - Session Plan Activity Process/Guidelines for Facilitator Resources Duration Welcome back Welcome the group and congratulate them on returning this week. Give them an overview of the session.Refreshments (optional)5 minutes Carbon Monoxide (CO) Monitoring & Test for Nicotine DependenceWhile individuals are having their CO reading completed, the group can complete a test to measure their nicotine dependence. Conduct CO readings one-to-one and participants record them on their CO personal chart. For tobacco users: Complete Fagerstrom Test and explain what it means. For e-cigarette users: Complete the Nicotine Dependence questionnaire for e-cigarettes users. NOTE: These tools measure nicotine dependence and will help to determine the best type and dose of medication. While there is no robust evidence base that these medications will support vaping cessation, first indications suggest that they may be useful as an aid to stop vaping. We know that these medicines have a good safety profile. Any young person taking medication should consult their GP and discuss with their parents/guardians beforehand.

Give an input on the effects of smoking on their oral health. See Facilitator Information 1 for more information. Facilitator Information 1: Oral health and smoking Handout 2B: Oral health5 minutes Overview of evidence based stop smoking methodsDeliver information on this topic as appropriate to the age group, e.g. if the group are all under the age of 18, do not deliver information on Champix. Give a briefing on stop smoking medications. See Facilitator Information 1 for details of each medication. Stop smoking medications: what are the choices? Costs, benefits and effectiveness of use How to use the medication and The recommended length of time to use the medication NOTE: Champix is not recommended for those under the age of 18 years, those who are pregnant or those who are breast- feeding. NOTE: Anyone under the age of 18 should consult their GP before taking any of the medications. NOTE: While the stop smoking medications have not been developed or tested for stop vaping use, first principles would suggest that they could be useful as a stop vaping aid. Participants should speak to their GP. Parents/guardians should also be consulted so that they can discuss the pros and cons of using any medication. Using Handout 2C, participants can complete the medications that they plan to use.

Appendices - Session feedback5 minutesTFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 31 Facilitator Information 1: Smoking and oral health When you smoke, along with the health problems we discussed last week, there are a range of oral health and dental problems that smoking causes too. Stained teeth Bad breath Gum disease Tooth loss Oral cancer Hairy tongue Pass around the Oral Health images from Handout 2B, which depict images of the mouth and teeth of people who smoke. A non-smoker's tongue is pink with many very small projections called papilla, which are surrounded by taste buds. Hairy Tongue is only seen in the mouths of smokers. It is a brown furry coating a bit like damp animal fur. It is caused by a build-up on the surface of the tongue. Tobacco smoke prevents the normal replacement of the papilla. Bacteria and food debris are trapped and cause bad breath. You cannot remove the hairy tongue by brushing, or by any other means, the only way to get rid of the hairy tongue is by stopping smoking. These are just some of them, but the good news is that stopping smoking can reverse many of these problems. Home Activity Check your tongue at home tonight for any signs of a hairy tongue starting. Check your teeth for tobacco staining (inside of lower teeth etc.) Tip for participants Book an appointment with your dental hygienist to have your teeth cleaned.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 32 Facilitator Information 2: Stop smoking medications What medications are available to support quitting smoking? NOTE: Young people over the age of 16 can self-consent for medical care and to attend a GP for treatment. For anyone receiving a service and treatment under the age of 16, parental consent is required. Champix and Zyban are not licensed for anyone under the age of 18. There may be circumstances where a GP will prescribe NRT to those under 18. There are a number of medications available to help relieve the withdrawal symptoms and cravings of quitting smoking and to wean your brain and body off nicotine. Some are only available on prescription (Champix and Zyban) and others are available to purchase over the counter (Nicotine Replacement Therapy). Taking any of the medications available can increase the chances of quitting and quitting permanently. It is important for participants to check with their GP or pharmacist to see which product would suit them best and its correct use. Champix/ Varenicline 11 Varencline is the clinical name for Champix. It is a prescription only tablet that helps relieve cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping smoking. It also reduces the enjoyment and pleasure you get from smoking by blocking the reward pathways. NOTE: Those choosing to use Champix need to start taking it 7 to 14 days before their quit date. There are a few precautions and contraindications to taking Champix. Precautions for anyone with: Moderate or severe Renal (kidney) impairment - reduce dose to 1mg per day Epilepsy It is not recommended for: People under 18 years of age Those who are pregnant or breast feeding Anyone with an allergy to varenicline or any of its ingredients Possible side effects: Less than one in ten people experience: Nausea - this usually resolves over time or the dose can be reduced for severe nausea Headaches Insomnia or abnormal dreams. 11 When this book was developed, Champix was not available. Please check with your local HSE Stop Smoking Advisor or local Pharmacist for an update on this.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 33Zyban/ Bupropion This is the first non-nicotine medication shown to be successful for smoking cessation. It is an anti-depressant and is available on prescription only from a doctor. Those choosing to use Zyban need to start taking the tablets 1 to 2 weeks before their quit date and treatment is recommended for 7 to 12 weeks. Precautions for elderly people and anyone with: Mild/moderate hepatic impairment Renal impairment Predisposing risk factors for seizures It is not recommended for those: With a history of seizure disorder Who are pregnant/breastfeeding In abrupt alcohol/sedative withdrawal With severe hepatic cirrhosis With a CNS tumour A history of bipolar disorder Using irreversible monoamine With a concomitant use of another oxidase inhibitors (allow 14 days) bupropion containing product With a history of bulimia, anorexia nervosa With an allergy to bupropion or excipients People under 18 Possible side effects Less than one in ten patients experience insomnia Less common symptoms (less than one in a hundred) Rash/ urticarial Headache/dizziness Fever Gastrointestinal problems e.g., dry mouth, nausea Low risk of seizure - less than one in a thousand. Nicotine Replacement Therapy Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) is a medication that will replace a small amount of nicotine, enough to take the edge off cravings and make them easier to deal with but not continue to stimulate the nicotine reward pathways in the brain. Using this medication can significantly increase your chances of success. NRT is available in a number of different products to suit different needs. TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 34You will need a doctor's recommendation for NRT if you are: Under 18 years of age Pregnant Breastfeeding NRT is available free of charge for medical cardholders with a doctor's prescription. Nicotine patches suit those who are regular smokers through the day. They are available in a 16- hour or 24-hour patch. The 24-hour patch keeps the nicotine levels constant and is best for those who smoke as soon as they wake up or who smoke during the night. Put the patch on a different, hairless part of the body each day so it will not irritate the skin. Some people may have skin sensitivity to the patch, if this happens try a different brand or switch to a different form of NRT. All medications should be stored safely. Nicotine gum relieves withdrawal symptoms and gives you something to do with your mouth in place of smoking. This can help change your habit of smoking. It is important to remember that nicotine gum is not chewed like regular gum. There is a special technique for releasing nicotine, which involves chewing, and parking the gum against the inside of the mouth. Nicotine inhaler consists of a mouthpiece and cartridges, which contain nicotine. When you inhale, the nicotine and vapour is absorbed into the blood through the lining of your mouth and throat. The mouthpiece is like a pen and replaces the hand and mouth action, which you use when smoking. It may suit you if you miss the routine of smoking and the puffing sensation. Nicotine lozenge comes in various strengths depending on how addicted you are to nicotine. Some people prefer the taste of lozenges to other oral forms of NRT. Nicotine is absorbed into the blood through the lining of your mouth as you suck. Lozenges may irritate your mouth and stomach and cause hiccups. Nicotine mouth spray is a fresh-tasting minty spray, which provides small doses of nicotine to help manage cravings when quitting. Users should use 1-2 sprays when they would normally smoke a cigarette or have cravings to smoke. The spray will begin to work in 60 seconds and this product is one of the fastest acting products to relieve cravings, but again there is a special technique in using this successfully. Talk to your stop smoking advisor and/or pharmacist for advice. The maximum dose is two sprays at a time. Up to four sprays per hour may be used and up to 64 sprays per day. What is combination NRT? Combination therapy provides for the use of both a fixed or slow release product (patch) and a flexible (fast acting) NRT format. This combination allows the person to have a continuous base level of nicotine from the patch and also allows them to use either the gum, inhaler, lozenge or mouth spray to deal with break-through cravings e.g. during times of stress, socialising etc. Research shows that combination therapy can increase the smoking cessation rate compared to a single formulation of NRT in smokers motivated to quit.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 35 Facilitator Activity 1: Understanding your smoking and vaping Give each participant a copy of Handout 2D: \"Understanding your smoking or vaping\". Divide the group into pairs Read out a question and have each pair discuss their answer for 2 minutes, (you may have a group of three for an odd numbered group). Next, have them move to a new partner. Read out the next question and ask them to discuss it with their new partner. Repeat the moving into new pairs with a new question each time until you have been through all the questions. To complete the activity, ask the whole group: What have you learned about what smoking means to you? What have you learned about what you might have to do to give up smoking? Facilitator Activity 2: What makes you great? Purpose of this activity is to reflect on positive achievements. Give each participant a copy of Handout 2E: \"What makes you great!\" Divide group into pairs Ask individuals to fill in the worksheet, in pairs, and they can share any information with which they are comfortable Explain that everyone in the group has skills and qualities that can help them to give up smoking.

Tell them that people are more likely to be successful in giving up smoking or vaping if they prepare well and support each other. Divide the group in two. Give out flip chart paper and pens. Ask one group, what can others do to help you give up? Ask the other group, what do others do that obstruct you from giving up? Display the two lists and ask the following question: Is there anything different in the two lists? Develop the discussion to come up with practical strategies to support one another to quit: what we should and should not do if we are going to support each other to give up. Facilitator Activity 2: How to quit smoking or vaping Explain that the purpose of this activity is to find ways to quit that suits each of us as an individual. There are many different ways to quit smoking or vaping. When people are going to give up smoking or vaping, they have to work out what is best for them. What works for one person may not work for another. Give everyone a copy of \"Quit the best way for you\", Handout 3A Go through it discussing each item in turn. Discuss whether anything is missing and whether the group can suggest any additions. Ask them to put any additions on the bottom of the sheet. Divide into pairs. Ask the pairs to go through each item on the sheet and to discuss whether it would be good for them. If it might work for them, they should tick the item. Bring everyone back together and ask each person in turn to say what might work for them. Discuss how they might go about doing the things they have identified. Discuss which items group members have in common. How might the group go about doing these things together? Finally, give each person a copy of Handout 3B: Top Tips for Quitting and Staying Quit, and allow time for discussion.

Place 3 different flipchart pages in a different corner of the room Each flipchart has a different name: Agree, Disagree or Not sure Explain that you are going to call out a statement about the tobacco industry. Once the statement has been read each participant should go to the relevant corner of the room according to what they think about that statement, i.e. do they agree, disagree or are they not sure. Following each statement and when participants have selected their responses, facilitate a discussion about the participants thought on each statement. Give participants an opportunity to voice their opinion and to challenge one another on their attitudes and opinions. Always back up the discussion with the correct facts in response to the statement provided. You can also use Facilitator Information 1 for more detail. Statements: 1. The tobacco industry does not deliberately market their products to young people. Notes for facilitator: \"The tobacco industry needs to recruit 50 new smokers in Ireland every day to maintain smoking rates. Since 80% of smokers start when they are children/young people, most of these new smokers are mostly children or young people.\" Read some of the quotes from the tobacco industry in Facilitator Information 2. 2. Young people are less likely to become addicted to nicotine than adults or older people. Notes for facilitator: \"Children and young people are especially vulnerable to harm from both active and passive smoking. They become addicted very quickly, and the earlier they begin to smoke, the harder it becomes for them to quit at a later stage. This is because of the impact that nicotine has on their developing brains.\" 3. The tobacco industry is concerned about the increase in e-cigarette users as it is taking away from their customer base. Notes for facilitator: \"The tobacco industry is not concerned at all because they own almost all of the e-cigarettes companies.\" 4. The tobacco industry does not market e-cigarettes to young people. Notes for facilitator: \"E-cigarettes companies have been accused of designing flavours that appeal to young people. Flavours that are associated with treats, snacks and sweets. Research conducted by the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society in 2019, also found that young people in Ireland have rejected the idea that the e-cigarette manufacturers do not design their advertising and packaging to attract children.\"TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 41 Facilitator Information 1: The truth about the tobacco industry It is estimat ed that the tobac co industry needs to recruit at least 50 new smokers each day just to maintain the smoking rates at their current level, and since 80% of smokers start when they are children/young people, most of these new smokers are mostly children or young people. Children and young people are especially vulnerable to harm from both active and passive smoking. They become addicted very quickly, and the earlier they begin to smoke, the harder it becomes for them to quit at a later stage. This is because of the impact that nicotine has on their developing brains. Young people are vulnerable to the societal impact of smoking and to the marketing practices of the tobacco industry. Despite strict laws in Ireland in relation to advertising and sale of cigarettes, young people are still being heavily influenced by the tobacco industry through subliminal messaging in the movies and the celebrity world. E-cigarette companies (which are almost entirely owned by the tobacco industry) have also been accused of designing flavours that appeal to young people. Flavours that are associated with treats, snacks and sweets. Young people in Ireland have also rejected the idea that the e-cigarette companies do not design their advertising and packaging to attract children. Who is the tobacco industry? The tobacco industry are a very powerful and manipulative industry that is more concerned about making profit and getting customers hooked than being concerned about the damage their product is doing. The four largest companies are: Philip Morris - worth $13.5 billion British American Tobacco - $5.2 billion Imperial Tobacco - worth $2.6 billion Japan Tobacco International - worth $7.7 billion The tobacco industry has a problem in that 1 in 2 smokers will die from a smoking related illness. The industry tries to recruit children and young people as it needs to find replacement consumers to buy and consume their products. Who are the most likely to take the risk of starting smoking and ignore the consequences? The answer is young people. Publicly the tobacco industry has always claimed that it does not use advertising to attract young people into smoking. However, documents from the tobacco industry, once confidential but now in the public domain reveal that they see the recruitment of under 18's to smoking as essential.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 42Here are some quotes from the tobacco industry: \"Younger adults are the only sources of replacement smokers\" AJ Reynolds 1984 \"Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer and the overwhelming majority of smokers first beginning to smoke while still in their teens... The smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris\". Philip Morris 1981 \"The ability to attract new smokers and develop them into a young adult franchise is key to brand development\". Philip Morris report, 1999 \"They got lips, we want them\". Reply of an RJ Reynolds representative when asked the age of the kids they were targeting \"The problem is how do you sell death? How do you sell a poison that kills 350,000 people per year, a 1,000 people a day? You do it with the great open spaces... the mountains, the open places, the lakes coming up to the shore. They do it with healthy young people. They do it with athletes. How could a whiff of a cigarette be of any harm in a situation like that? It couldn't be - there's too much fresh air, too much health - too much absolute exuding of youth and vitality - that's the way they do it\". Fritz Gahagan, who spoke about how the tobacco industry marketed its products in 1980.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 43 Facilitator Activity 4: Media influences and the tobacco industry If there are time constraints, you can chose to complete this Activity or Activity 1. The purpose of this activity is to raise awareness among young people about how films and TV shows have been used to normalise and promote smoking down through the decades. It will also highlight how vaping has now become normalised in films and TV. You can use the information in Facilitator Information 3: Smoking and Vaping in the Movies, to support the conversation. What to do: 1. Play the video \"Straight to vape: While you were streaming 2020\" https:/ /truthinitiative.org/ research-resources/tobacco-pop-culture/research-finds-tobacco-imagery-tv-and-streaming- shows-drives You can also find this link on YouTube by typing in \"Straight to vape: While you were streaming 2020\" 2. Ask the following question: Do you think that movies and/or TV have an influence on the lives of young people? If so, how? 3. Now ask the participants: Are you surprised that even though most tobacco companies are barred from paid brand placement that a significant number of top grossing films continue to feature smoking in movies targeted at teens? Do you think that exposure to smoking or vaping in movies or on TV gives young people a positive perception of smoking or vaping? Do you think that exposure to smoking or vaping in the movies increases young people's intentions to try smoking or vaping?TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 444. Now read the following information: The following information is taken from the Health Behaviours of School Aged Children, 2018. Children aged 12 to 17 were asked about their use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes. 11% of children reported that they have ever smoked 5% reported to be current smokers 22% of children reported that they had tried an e-cigarette 9% reported to be current e-cigarette users 5. Now ask the group: Are you surprised about these figures? 6. Finally finish off this session with the following questions: Do you think that young people are influenced by what they see in movies or on the TV? Can you think of any movies or TV shows aimed at young people where smoking or vaping is featured? If there was one key message to give to your peers, what would it be?TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 45 Facilitator Information 2: Smoking and vaping in the movies While it is more difficult for the tobacco industry to expose young people to images of people smoking, films are one place where it is normal to see people smoking. 12 Films give the tobacco industry a great opportunity to market a product that kills 6 million people a year to young people. The tobacco industry has been shown to make as much as \u20ac635 million a year because of new smokers influenced by the movies. A study in the USA found that teenagers who were exposed to high levels of smoking in movies were almost 3 times more likely to smoke than those who had little exposure. Teenagers whose favourite stars smoke are up to 16 times more likely to think favourably of smoking. Smoking in movies makes it appear normal and admirable to smoke. E-cigarette use is also becoming more commonplace in films and TV, fuelling the idea that it is normal and acceptable. As we now know, e-cigarette companies are almost entirely owned by the tobacco industry. 12 The information on this page has been taken from www.cancer.ie TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 46Week 4 - Coping with withdrawal and stress Aim: To support the participants to stay quit and look at ways of managing stress and coping with withdrawal.

Many smokers believe that smoking or vaping relieves stress but in fact, the opposite is true. Rather than act as an aid to control mood, nicotine dependency seems to increase stress. This is confirmed in the daily mood patterns described by smokers, with normal moods during smoking and worsening moods between cigarettes. Dependent smokers need nicotine to remain feeling normal.13 Every time you smoke or vape your body produces adrenaline, the \"fight or flight\" hormone. This actually makes you more stressed; it raises your blood pressure and increases your heart rate. What is stress? Definition: \"Mismatch between the demands placed on us and our ability to cope with these demands\" (Irish Heart Foundation). The way we cope with life's demands depends on how we think, our personality and our life experiences. Stress is hard to measure. It can be positive in that it motivates and challenges us to get things done. However, it can be negative when we feel under constant pressure and overwhelmed by too many demands. What normally causes us stress? School, college, exams, relationships, deadlines, illness, quitting smoking or vaping.... Short term effects of stress - examples: Long term effects of stress - examples: Mind becomes alert, ready to act or react Dilated pupils - our pupils get bigger Dry mouth Tension in our neck and shoulders Breathing faster Heart rate increases Blood pressure rises Sweaty palms Feel sick - butterflies in our stomach Increased need to pass urine Constipation or diarrhoea Headaches Dizziness Blurred vision Ulcers Hyperventilation, palpitations High blood pressure Heart problems High blood sugar Nervous indigestion Disturbed sleep patterns Difficulty swallowing Neck and back problems Bowel disorders Rashes and allergies Sexual difficulties 13 https:/ /pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10540594/ TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 51Coping People who cope best with stress seem to have these things in common: A sense of being in control of their lives A network of family or friends to provide social support Personality traits such as being flexible and hopeful. For more information: Mental Health Ireland: https:/ /www.mentalhealthireland.ie/ mental health: Jigsaw: the National Centre for Five ways to well-being: https:/ Oct 2022 HQS0150 52 Facilitator Activity 1: Recognising and dealing with stress Discussion The purpose of this activity is to discover what causes us stress, how can we recognise it and then what we can do to relieve it. Start the discussion by asking the young people the following questions: 1. How do you know when you are stressed? 2. What signs do we have that we are stressed? 3. In what situations do we become stressed? 4. How can we manage stress and become more relaxed? 5. How do you/can you cope with stress without smoking or vaping? Additional information to support discussion: Many people reach for a cigarette or an e-cigarette as a way of dealing with stress. Giving up nicotine can also be very stressful in itself. However, if you use nicotine replacement to wean your body from nicotine for a 12 week period and become nicotine free you will help reduce the stress from nicotine withdrawal. For those who use smoking or vaping as a coping mechanism for day to day stress, it is important to prepare and plan for alternative ways of coping and managing stressful situations to prevent relapse. Some other points to make about stress: There are some positive types of stress e.g. the fight or flight response. If you are in a forest and suddenly a grizzly bear starts chasing you, you will probably decide to run. This type of stress response is important if you want to survive. The increased adrenaline released in your body will shift blood flow and oxygen to your muscles and brain where it is needed, and away from other organ systems such as your bowel. The idea is to run for your life, and stress in this situation is vital. Now contrast the normal fight or flight response to the abnormal release of adrenaline caused by nicotine. The regular release of adrenaline triggered by nicotine in tobacco or e-cigarettes, increases heart rate and blood pressure. The human body was not designed to use adrenaline on a regular basis. This not only takes its toll on the body in the longer term, but may also increase the amount of physical stress experienced, due to the stimulant effects of nicotine. Established daily patterns of smoking or vaping can be seen as an attempt to avoid withdrawal symptoms by having another cigarette/ e-cigarette, thus continuing the cycle of addiction.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 53 The reality is that smoking or vaping can actually increase stress levels. The false sense of stress relief is experienced due to the effect of nicotine on dopamine receptors in the brain: the reward and pleasure pathways of the brain. Dopamine is released after having a cigarette or e-cigarette containing nicotine, which can give a sense of calm. When tobacco or e-cigarettes containing nicotine are used to alleviate stress regularly, then they can become a crutch, which smokers and e-cigarette users often say helps them cope with stressful situations. However, the reality is that smoking or vaping does not solve the problem. The root cause of the stress needs to be dealt with appropriately, whether you smoke or vape.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 54 Facilitator Activity 2: Mindfulness meditation practice Introduce the practice with this information: \"Mindfulness can take various forms depending upon the person. Sometimes, it can be as simple as allowing yourself permission to chill out. Possibly allowing a few minutes sometime in your day to do nothing other than sit quietly, listen to music or whatever. The idea is to try to schedule it into your life as you would any other important activity.\" Using the script below, guide the participants through a Mindfulness practise. Read the instructions very slowly. It will help if the room is quiet, possibly slightly darkened and everyone has a comfortable chair. Discuss with the group how they felt and how they might be able to use this activity or one like it for themselves. Alternatively visit: YouTube: Mindfulness Jon Kabet Zinn https:/ /www.padraigomorain.com/free-mindfulness-audios/ Guided Meditation Script Begin by making yourself comfortable. Sit in a chair and allow your back to be straight, but not stiff, with your feet on the ground. Your hands could be resting gently in your lap or at your side. Allow your eyes to close, if you feel comfortable. Take several long, slow, deep breaths. Breathing in fully and exhaling slowly. Breathe in through your nose and out through your nose or mouth. Feel your stomach expand on an inhale, relax, and let go as you exhale. Now slowly bring your attention down to your feet. Begin observing sensations in your feet. You might want to wiggle your toes a little, feeling your toes against your socks or shoes. You might imagine sending your breath down to your feet, as if the breath is traveling through the nose to the lungs and through the abdomen all the way down to your feet. Then back up again out through your nose and lungs. Take a moment to notice how this feels. Now, let your attention expand out to include the entire body as a whole. Bring into your awareness the top of your head down to the bottom of your toes. Feel the gentle rhythm of the breath as it moves through the body. As you come to the end of this practice, take a full, deep breath, taking in all the energy of this practice. Exhale fully. When you are ready, open your eyes and return your attention to the present moment. As you become fully alert and awake.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 55 Facilitator Activity 3: How to say no, coping with stress This activity is a role-play.

If the group are comfortable, this activity can be done as a large group. What to say: Many people worry that they will put on a lot of weight when they quit either smoking or vaping. Now ask the question: Why do you think some people put on weight when they quit? Allow the groups to discuss their thoughts and opinions. You can support the conversation with the following points: Nicotine is an appetite suppressant, and therefore if you quit smoking or vaping you might feel more hungry Smoking and vaping can reduce your sense of taste and smell. Therefore, when you quit, food often tastes better, so you might eat more Some people replace smoking or vaping after a meal with a second helping of food or biscuits Some people replace smoking or vaping with eating especially if they are anxious Nicotine increases your metabolic rate: the rate at which your body creates and uses energy. Nicotine causes your heart to beat faster and therefore use more energy - increasing your metabolism slightly. When you quit smoking or vaping the body changes and needs less energy from food. This can lead to putting on weight if you continue to consume the same amount of food Some people do put on weight when they quit, 1.81 - 3.8kg (4 - 7lbs) on the average, but not everybody gains weight, some may actually lose it or stay the same You would have to gain 56.7 kg (about 9 stone) to get the same risk to your health as smoking cigarettes every day! Use Guide to healthy food choices booklet (if available) and the food pyramid to demonstrate how to plan healthy food choices, the recommended number of servings from each shelf and portion sizes.

Encourage the participants to think about: What they can do to create smoke free spaces What legislation is already in place What more could be done and How we can protect young people from the dangers of tobacco and the tobacco industry. You can also explore the dangers of e-cigarette use and how it is becoming normalised for many young people - perceived as a healthier option to smoking tobacco. Use Facilitator Information 2: Smoke Free Initiatives in Ireland, overleaf for more information. Lead the discussion by asking the following questions: Ask the group if they know of any additional pieces of legislation regarding tobacco or e-cigarette use that have come into play since the smoking ban in 2004 (see CF Information 1) What impact have these pieces of legislation had on society, you or your family? What are the benefits of smoke free places and how can they help you and others to stay quit? As the course will be ending soon, is there a smoke free initiative in your community/ school/youth club with which you could get involved? Smoke free places - what can you do in your community? Have you heard about \"Not Around Us\"? If so, ask someone to explain this initiative. Check out this link for more information: https:/ /www.limerick.ie/council/services/ community-and-leisure/community-development/not-around-us. You can also refer back to the Facilitator Information 2: The truth about the tobacco industry from week 3.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 62 Facilitator Information 2: Smoke free initiatives in Ireland The Irish Government set an ambitious tar get to have a smoke free Ireland by 2025. This means a smoking prevalence of 5%. For annual updates on this progress, you should check https:/ /www.gov.ie/en/collection/231c02-healthy-ireland-survey-wave/. In 2021, the smoking prevalence stood at 18%. In order to reach this target, significant action to create smoke-free communities needs to happen at a local level. Young people can take action in their own communities by exploring the impact of smoking locally. Strategies to de-normalise smoking and make it less attractive and acceptable to young people are required. In order to prevent young people from starting to smoke and to contribute to a Tobacco Free Ireland, young people need to be facilitated and supported to consider the environmental impacts and to visualise and take local action towards a smoke free community. This is not an anti-smoker approach but a measure to change our view of smoking in our own communities. By reducing the acceptability of smoking and vaping in our communities, we can help protect children and young people from starting smoking and vaping. The Tobacco ban in Ireland Smoking in workplaces in Ireland was banned on 29 March 2004. Ireland was the first country in the world to have an outright ban on smoking in workplaces, with fines of up to \u20ac3,000 on the spot. Premises must display a sign to inform patrons of the ban. Ireland also banned in-store tobacco advertising and displays of tobacco products at retail outlets and a ban on the sale of packets of 10 cigarettes in the second half of 2009. The same bill also started new controls on tobacco vending machines. Since the ban, a number of additional pieces of legislation have been introduced and enacted: 2009: A ban on in-store tobacco advertising and displays of tobacco products at retail outlets and a ban on the sale of packets of 10 cigarettes. 2013: Graphic warnings on tobacco packaging displaying health warnings, such as \"Smoking Kills.\" They must cover at least 30% on the front and 40% on the back of the packaging. 2016: Ban on smoking in a car with a child. 2017: Plain cigarette packaging was introduced. 2019: Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill 2019, see overleaf: In July 2022, The Joint Committee on Health published its report on pre-legislative scrutiny of the Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill 14. 14 https:/ /data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/committee/dail/33/joint_committee_on_health/reports/2022/2022-07-15_report-on-pre-legislative-scrutiny-of-the-public- health-tobacco-and-nicotine-inhaling-products-bill-2019_en.pdfTFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 63Among the recommendations of this report were: The sale of e-cigarettes to those under-18 should be restricted. The prohibition on the sale of tobacco products from temporary or movable premises should be extended to e-cigarettes. The Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) 15 was signed into Irish law in 2016. The TPD came from the European Union and it lays out laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products. Here are some of the regulations laid out in the TPD: A ban on cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco with characterising flavours such as fruit flavours, menthol or vanilla Minimum unit pack size of 30g for Roll-Your-Own tobacco (rollies) A ban on tobacco products containing certain additives A ban on any misleading labelling (such as \"natural\" or \"organic\") The TPD also includes regulations on e-cigarettes, which include: Ensure that e-cigarettes containers and refills are child-proof They must deliver nicotine doses at consistent levels The containers must meet safety and health standards, e.g. they do not break or leak during use and refill They must include appropriate health warnings and should not include any misleading elements or features. Smoke Free Homes A smoke free home is one where nobody smokes inside the home. This is an initiative to protect the health of the family from exposure to second hand smoke. It also helps to de-normalise smoking within the home and the family. For someone quitting smoking, creating a smoke free home will offer great support. 15 For more information and the full list of regulations on the TPD see: https:/ /www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/tobaccocontrol/tobaccoproductdirective/TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 64HSE Tobacco Free Campus 16 In order to implement national policy objectives contained in Healthy Ireland and Tobacco Free Ireland, the HSE has adopted an official corporate Tobacco Free Campus Policy. The policy has two clear aims: To treat tobacco as a healthcare issue. To de-normalise tobacco use in all healthcare services and settings. Tobacco Free Playground 17 The first smoke free playground was introduced in Donegal in 2010. Since then, ASH Ireland, the leading anti-tobacco advocacy organisation in Ireland, has contacted county and city councils throughout Ireland encouraging them to voluntarily introduce smoke free playgrounds. HSE Health Promotion and Improvement departments and the HSE Tobacco Free Ireland programme have worked closely with many local authorities and other organisations to promote tobacco free spaces for children and families. There has been a very positive response with most now having smoke free signage in place. There are two main aims of the tobacco free playgrounds: To help protect children from exposure to second-hand smoke and To de-normalise tobacco use to future generations. Not Around Us \"Not Around Us\" is a campaign to discourage smokers from smoking or vaping around others. The campaign is about promoting an environment where it is easier for those who smoke or vape to quit and stay quit, with a focus on de-normalising smoking and vaping for the next generation. The purpose of \"Not Around Us\" is: Help protect children and young people from second-hand smoke exposure Contribute to the de-normalisation of smoking for children and young people Reduce environmental nuisance, cost of cleaning and damage that discarded tobacco products create Signpost the HSE Quit services This campaign was originally launched by Limerick City and County Council supported by the HSE, Limerick Comhairle na n\u00d3g, Limerick Children and Young People's Services Committee, Limerick Childcare Committee, Healthy Ireland and ASH Ireland, Council of the Irish Heart Foundation. The campaign won a prestigious World Health Organisation award on World No Tobacco Day May 31st in 2020. The campaign is now active in County Clare, Galway, Wexford, Louth and Meath and still growing.

Stages of Change Model The process of change involves a number of stages: Stages of Change Model: Adapted from Prochaska and DiClemente Understanding relapse Some people may experience a \"slip\" when they have one or a few cigarettes or a puff of an e-cigarette. For some, this might be temporary and for others this may mean that they start to smoke or vape again. It is important to remember that this happens to some people but not everyone. If you do have a slip or start to smoke/vape again, there are measures you can take to help you become nicotine free again. It is important to remember that you have already quit and can do it again. Give yourself credit for what you have managed to do so far. Remember the effort that you put in and draw from the learning that you have had from doing this. Get back on track as soon as possible. If you want to quit, you can do it.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 69Think about what caused you to slip in the first place. What could you do differently to help you manage this situation if it happened again? You might want to think about the following: Your reasons to quit in the first place. Do these still apply to you or are there new ones to add? Challenges that you have had and how you managed not smoke or vape. What did you do instead and how did you cope without needing or wanting to smoke or vape? What supports have you used and found helpful? What could you look at now to support you again? Resources that you have from this programme. What did you find useful? The health or financial benefits of quitting and staying smoke and nicotine free. Situations that are a challenging for you, such as socialising, alcohol or stress. What techniques have you learned that could help you to manage these more effectively and stay smoke and nicotine free? How you handled situations when you first quit. Maybe you planned situations in advance so that you helped yourself not to smoke or vape. Does going back to old habits and behaviours such as drinking tea or coffee make you feel tempted to smoke or vape? If so, you might want to change this again for a while so that you can avoid this trigger. Check out www.Quit.ie for further tips and ideas to support you, as you stay quit. Remember when you quit smoking, you are doing something that will benefit you immediately and in the long term.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 70 Facilitator Activity 1: Discussion - Preventing relapse Part A - Reasons for relapse and how to cope with relapse Facilitate a discussion on keeping up motivation and preventing relapse during times of crises or stressful situations. Remind the participants about the Stages of Change, Handout 1D that was covered on week 1. Use Facilitator Information 1, and Handouts 6C and 6D to support this discussion. Use a flip chart to record the feedback from the questions below: What are some reasons you might relapse? For example, stress, family or relationship problems, celebrations, falsely believing that 'just one cigarette will not hurt', putting on weight, out with friends and started up again. How will you deal with relapse? Now ask the participants to identify triggers and plan coping strategies to deal with them. They can complete Handout 6C to write these down. Stress the importance of the \"Not a Puff\" Rule, as it is a common cause of relapse. If there is time and/or it is appropriate for the profile of the group continue onto Part B, below. This discussion explores ways of coping during times of extreme stress or crises. Part B - Managing and preventing relapse during crises moments Read the following: \"When tragedy strikes... Life can throw things at us that can change our life very dramatically. It might be (use examples below as appropriate to the group): An exam not going the way you had hoped Breakdown of a relationship or longstanding friendship The diagnosis of a serious illness of someone we love, a parent, a partner, a brother or sister, a child or a friend or maybe yourself Something we have witnessed where a disturbing memory stays in our head Tragedy in our lives can come at any time and hit us very hard. We cannot be completely prepared for these events in our lives. Yet there are some things we can do. For example, if you travel in a car, you would put your safety belt on to reduce the risk in the case that something went wrong - and because it's the law. If you were on your bike, you would put your helmet on to protect you in case you fell or you were knocked off. TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 71Sometimes, when people have been smoking/vaping and quit, the risk of relapsing may be greater when they are faced with a crisis or some form of trauma. Someone might just \"offer\" a cigarette without thinking to help \"calm you down\" or you might reach for a vape and take a puff. This could mean your hard work to quit going down the drain in a second. We do not want anything sad or tragic to happen in our lives, but unfortunately, sometimes they do.\" Now use the questions below to facilitate a wider discussion on managing crises and stressful situations. What can we do to help us to cope when unexpected or expected challenges come into our lives? What sort of situations do you think could happen in your life that could trigger a relapse? What techniques have you looked at to help you so far in your quit journey? What coping strategies could you suggest as a group to have \"up your sleeve\" in case anything traumatic, unexpected or expected, were to happen? These should be strategies that would help you to deal effectively with preventing relapse and staying nicotine free. What would be your top 10 tips to deal with trauma or a crisis situation and avoid relapse and to stay nicotine free? Give the participants a copy of Handouts 6C and 6D, which provide information and tips on how to stay quit and prevent relapse.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 72 Facilitator Activity 2: Discussion - Tobacco, e-cigarettes and the environment Use the notes in Facilitator Information 2: Tobacco, e-cigarettes and the environment to support this discussion Ask the group the question: What are the environmental risks of smoking to local communities? If they are struggling to come up with any answers, you can use these additional questions to prompt responses: How does litter make people feel in their community? How can animals be harmed by litter? How might smoking or e-cigarette use affect habitats and biodiversity? Where does litter go if it is washed away in drains and rivers? What is the impact on animals then? How does tobacco or e-cigarette litter add to climate change? Follow this discussion with the following question: What do you think are some of the global impacts of tobacco use on the environment?TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 73 Facilitator Information 2: Tobacco, e-cigarettes and the environment 18, 19 Cigarette butts are one of the most common forms of litter in our communities in Ireland today. A report in 2017 showed that cigarette litter makes up 56% of litter in Ireland. Cigarette butts and filters contain cellulose acetone and can take up to 12 years to decompose. They are believed to kill birds, fish and other small animals. One cigarette butt has the ability to pollute 500 litres of water. Tobacco threatens many of the earth's resources. Its impact is felt in ways that extend far beyond the effects of the smoke released into the air by tobacco products when consumed. The harmful impact of the tobacco industry in terms of deforestation, climate change, and the waste it produces is vast and growing Tobacco is often grown without proper crop rotation, which means that it is vulnerable to pests and disease. Therefore, large amounts of chemicals are required to control them. Many of these chemicals are banned in some countries as they cause harm to the environment and the farmers working on the land Forests are cleared for tobacco plantation leading to mass deforestation Tobacco manufacturing uses a significantly large amount of water and energy when compared to other companies and manufacturers Use of plastic materials for packaging Tobacco smoke contains thousands of toxic chemicals, most of which are released into the air in the form of side-stream smoke With up to two-thirds of every smoked cigarette discarded onto the ground, between 340 and 680 million kilogrammes of waste tobacco product litters the world each year. The waste from these tobacco products contain 7000 chemicals, many known to be carcinogenic, which then leak into the environment. E-cigarette waste is potentially a more serious environmental threat than cigarette butts since e-cigarettes introduce plastic, nicotine salts, heavy metals, lead, mercury, and flammable lithium-ion batteries into waterways, soil, and to wildlife. Unlike cigarette butts, e-cigarette waste won't biodegrade even under severe conditions. E-cigarettes left on the street eventually break down into microplastics and chemicals that flow into the storm drains to pollute our waterways and wildlife. In addition to all of the above, tobacco farmers in low and middle-income countries face an economic struggle, earning low wages for very labour intensive work. In some regions, many of those working on the farms are children. They are exposed to nicotine and pesticide poisoning. Green Tobacco Sickness is a type of nicotine poisoning caused by the dermal absorption of nicotine from the wet tobacco plants.

Close the session by congratulating everyone in the group - not just those that quit. Direct them to other support services that are available, if they need them in the future. Remind them to tell their friends about the course, as there will be another one coming soon. Facilitator Activity 1: One positive experience (Part B)10 minutes TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 77 Facilitator Activity 1: One positive experience Part A - complete this at the start of the session Ask each participant to write one positive experience on the flipchart that he/she has had over the past 6 weeks. Alternatively, ask them to call out and the facilitator can write on the flipchart. Some may say that they have quit smoking or vaping, and others may say something that is related to quitting or being part of the group: something that was unexpected or an added bonus. You could give a couple of examples to avoid everyone saying the same thing. Examples of responses: I have not smoked or vaped for 3 weeks My friend has quit with me I have more energy now and I am thinking about taking up jogging I don't get out of breath as much when I am playing football I have saved \u20ac______ I have made new friends in the group I have learned that I am in control I feel stronger now, more empowered, as I did not think before that I could do this. Example of responses for those who may not have quit or have relapsed: I had quit for 2 weeks, and I know I can do it again I have learned that I have control The support from the group has given me strength/belief that I can do it I know that I am not alone and that is comforting I understand myself better now and why I smoke or vape. Now I can do something about it Part B - complete this at the end of the session Tell the group to think about their responses from the start of the session, and now ask them for their hopes for the future.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 78Section 3 Additional Activities This section contains additional activities that you can use throughout the course, depending on time, the age group and/or the interests of the group.

You can chose some or all of the questions, depending on time, age of the group and topics that may come up throughout the course of the programme. This activity can also be used as a way of engaging young people before a course starts. Please note, there are more questions/statements overleaf Question 1: Most people in Ireland smoke Answer: Myth. The 2021 Healthy Ireland Survey shows that 18% of the population smokes. More than 9 out of 10 young Irish people DO NOT smoke and it is actually not the norm to be a smoker. However, in some communities where people might not have as much money as others more people might smoke. This could be due to stress or it being a bit more acceptable to smoke. If you grow up in a family where others smoke you are more likely to smoke yourself. Question 2: Smoking won't affect my health until I am much older Answer: Myth Even smoking a little can cause damage. Research has shown that even \"occasional\" smoking, smoking only a few cigarettes per day, or smoking \"without inhaling\" can increase your risk of ill health and shorten your life. Smoking causes bad breath, wrinkles and ageing of the skin in young people. Another problem with smoking \"just a little\" is that most people cannot do it for long. Cigarettes are addictive and most people cannot continue to be occasional smokers for long. Soon, they find themselves smoking every day, several times a day. Any the more they smoke, the more they are damaging their health. Question 3: Smoking and vaping is a personal choice Answer: Open to interpretation. Some people say smoking or vaping is a personal choice and you choose to smoke or vape every time. We know that nicotine is a powerful addictive drug. Completing the questionnaires for nicotine dependence will help determine a persons physical addiction to nicotine. Once you are addicted to nicotine, it is not a personal choice and that's why we need to regulate things like marketing, displays and using nicotine products indoors so young people don't start in the first instance and don't see it as the normal thing to do. In addition, adults and children who breathe in other peoples smoke do not do so by choice and their health is affected without realising it.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 82Question 4: Smoking and vaping helps people to relax Answer: Myth While people feel relaxed when inhale nicotine from tobacco or e-cigarettes, these are actually stimulants. This means that they accelerate the heart rate, raise the blood pressure and suppress appetite. It is thought that the deep breathing when inhaling relaxes the person and getting their nicotine hit prevents them from going into withdrawals. However, there are other ways to relax, which are much healthier than smoking and vaping. Young people who use smoke or vape are more likely to report irritability, bad temper, feeling low and less happiness with life. Question 5: Smoking or vaping won't affect my health until I am much older Answer: Myth Smoking impacts many parts of your body not just your lungs and heart. As a smoker, you are at risk for many types of cancer such as mouth, throat, lung, stomach, kidney and bladder cancer. Tobacco smoke can cause gum disease, tooth decay and bad breath. Smoking can affect your appearance. It can age your skin by 10 to 20 years and it stains you fingers and teeth. It can also affect your sense of taste and smell. These are only just some of the effects smoking can have on your body. While scientists are still learning about the short and long-term health effects of using e-cigarettes, a recent outbreak of lung disease and deaths related to e-cigarette use in the United States demonstrates that e-cigarette aerosol can be harmful to the lungs causing a condition called popcorn lung. E-cigarettes can also be modified to deliver marijuana and other harmful substances that have been linked to lung disease. Defective e-cigarette batteries have caused some fires and explosions, which exposes the user to the risk of serious injury and burns. Questions 6: Everyone who smokes enjoys it. Answer: Myth 60% of people who smoke actually want to quit. Most people smoke not because they enjoy it but because they feel miserable if they don't have a cigarette. Those who want to quit find it really hard to give up because of the nicotine addiction.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 83Questions 7: A nicotine addiction has similar chemical characteristics as a heroin addiction Answer: Fact Research has shown that the way in which a person addicted to nicotine behaves, is similar to that of a person with a heroin addiction. A person grows a nicotine receptor in their brain, which they have to feed regularly with a cigarette or e-cigarette because the body will crave the nicotine. When a person inhales, it takes 7 seconds for the nicotine to reach the brain. A person has withdrawal symptoms when they quit smoking or vaping because the body is craving a hit. Question 8: Smoking affects sports performance Answer: Fact It is a well-known fact that smoking reduces fitness levels. Carbon monoxide found in cigarettes replaces oxygen in the body, which makes it harder for the body to function especially during exercise. Smoking replaces vital oxygen, which needs to be absorbed into the blood and muscles. Inhaling smoke also restricts the airways and makes it harder for the person to breathe and take in oxygen. We need oxygen to fuel us and give us energy to keep running and exercising. Smoking also increases the heart rate, which during exercise can affect fitness. Question 9: Smoking rollies is less harmful than smoking cigarettes Answer: Myth Some people mistakenly believe that Roll-You-Own (RYO or rollies) tobacco is less harmful than factory made cigarettes. This could be because they think that loose tobacco is more \"natural\". However, many of the 7000 chemicals in cigarette smoke come from burning the tobacco itself. These include tar and all the chemicals that cause cancer and other chronic diseases. Researchers believe that RYO are as harmful as or even more harmful than smoking factory made cigarettes. Question 10: If your parents smoke when you are a child you are more likely to be a smoker yourself Answer: Fact Children who grow up in a house with smokers are more likely to start smoking themselves. This could be because children or young people think that it is normal to smoke and their parents are role models. Parents can help their children not to start smoking by making the house and car smoke free20, sharing their quitting struggles and by attempting to quit. 20 A ban on smoking in vehicles when children are present came into effect in the Republic of Ireland on 1st January 2016TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 84Relaxation Exercises Quick body scan Practice: become aware of your body, moving your awareness from the top of your head to your toes. Commentary: In this practice, you use your body to help you to be mindful. The body scan is a valuable practice, both in helping you to notice where you are tense and in helping you to relax that tension. Imagine the flow of awareness moving from your head to your toes, almost as though you are under a shower of awareness. If you want to go deeper: if you notice any tension, imagine that you are breathing into it and then move on. After you have completed the quick body scan, remain at rest for a few moments before you go on with whatever you are doing. Mindful walking Practice: being aware of the sounds of your feet on the ground, and the noises and colours around you. Activity: tell the group that they can chose to walk outside or indoors. If walking indoors they can take off their shoes. The purpose is to walk slowly, taking deep breaths. Advise the group that they should walk at their own pace, in any direction (if space allows), and to breathe deeply and slowly, as they take in the colours, sounds and notice the sensations below their feet. Allow 8 to 10 minutes for this activity. Notice your shoulders Practice: bring your attention to your shoulders, and relax. Then allow them to relax a little more than they are already. Commentary: when we lose awareness of what is going on, we tend to lose awareness of our bodies as well. This is especially so when we are tense. That is when we raise our shoulders, scrunching them up as though we are getting ready to launch ourselves into battle. As soon as we become aware of our shoulders we realise what we are doing to them and we relax them. Do yourself a favour and bring your attention to your shoulders more often, you will be more mindful and you will waste less energy tensing them up unnecessarily. If you want to go deeper: when you allow your shoulders to relax, also allow your spine to straighten a little. Experience this posture for a while and bring your breathing into your awareness as well.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 85Mindful feet Practice: pay attention for a few moments to the sensation of your feet against the floor or the ground. Commentary: to do this you have to come out of your mental chatter and into reality. If you're sitting, how lightly are your feet resting on the floor? If you are standing, are you relaxed or tense? Do you notice a tingling sensation in the soles of your feet? Do your feet feel light against the floor or do they feel as though they are rooted? Either is good - this is just an awareness exercise. If you find it hard to focus on your breathing, bringing your attention to your feet is a good technique. If you want to go deeper: bring your attention to that tingling sensation in your feet for a while. Notice if the sensations are becoming stronger or fainter, if your feet are getting warmer or cooler. Mindfulness of posture Practice: Now and then, become aware of your posture for a few moments. Commentary: becoming aware of your posture provides a very quick way to become mindful. It is especially helpful if you sit in front of a computer, huddling into a screen with your muscles tensed up. It is also good for drivers who can easily tense up their neck and shoulder muscles without noticing. However, mindfulness of posture was practised long before the invention of computers and cars. That is because the body is not in the past or the future - it is here, in this present moment, and mindfulness of posture can bring an immediate sense of presence and calm. If you want to go deeper: when checking your posture, do a quick scan of your body, noting areas of tension and of calm. Allow your body to settle into a sense of balance. Wash your hands Practice: wash your hands mindfully, feeling the sensation of the water and soap. If you do not have access to a washbasin, imagine you are doing this exercise and do it for real when you get a chance. Alternatively, use hand cream and take the time to do it slowly and with care and mindfulness. Commentary: this is a good example of an everyday activity that you can use to bring you into mindfulness. Most of us wash our hands many times a day and we often do it in a distracted sort of way. Try bringing awareness to the task, guiding your attention back if it wanders. Feel the water, soap, the temperature of the water, the sensation of one hand washing the other. It is precisely because this is such a simple, practical, frequent, everyday act that washing your hands in awareness is such a useful mindfulness practice. If you want to go deeper: as well as washing your hands mindfully, dry them mindfully. When you have finished, try to bring some of that sense of awareness to whatever you do next.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 86Drink your tea This might be useful during a break to reflect on drinking tea and/or coffee and not smoking and see what the experience is like. Practice: next time you are drinking a cup of tea (or coffee) be aware of at least the first minute of the experience. Commentary: of the vast amount of tea and coffee drunk in the world every day, many are drunk with little or no awareness. That is a pity - a missed opportunity to enjoy one of the day's small pleasures. Bringing even a minute of awareness to the experience helps build a mindfulness practice into your day while doing something you were going to do anyway and it means you get more value from your tea or coffee. If you want to go deeper: pay attention to the taste and aroma (smell). Think of the millions of other people who are having a tea or coffee right now and decide that you will be among those who do so in awareness.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 87Identifying and dealing with stress Having discussed what stress is, you want the group to identify what causes them stress and how it manifests itself. Task 1 - identifying stress Divide the group into smaller groups (3 or 4 people). Ask the groups to identify how they experience stress in their body, e.g. headache, vomiting, sleeplessness, etc. One person in each group writes the responses on separate Post-it notes. Make a collage of responses - you could draw a body on some flipchart paper and place the Post-it notes on the part of the body that is affected. Allow the group time to read all the responses and make comments. Task 2 - what causes me stress? Ask the group to identify what causes them stress. This can be done in one large group or go back to the smaller groups. Allow the participants to call out answers and write on flipchart paper or on Post-it notes in smaller groups - share with the larger group when done. Now ask each person to choose one of the things that causes them stress. They can keep this to themselves for now, and we will look again at it in a few minutes. Task 3 - dealing with stress Brainstorm ways of dealing with stress. This can be done in the smaller groups or the larger group. Write on the flipchart or Post-it notes as appropriate. Allow whole group discussion. Now, from the earlier activity, ask everyone to remember that one thing that causes them stress. Ask each person to: 1. Choose one way of coping with this stressful situation - allow the group to discuss in larger or smaller groups. 2. Identify and plan for the coming week - what are you going to do if this stressful situation presents itself to you this week?TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 88Physical activity idea Exercise Bingo Equipment: Bingo sheets with exercises (pictures or written) Pen or pencil per participant Be mindful of different levels of ability and fitness.

Choose the one that suits your group the best or use a variety from week to week. These are useful tools that can be used at the end of a session or a particular exercise. They can also provide you with some feedback to help plan future sessions. Questions or statements You can use the phrases below to get some feedback from participants on a session. Use one or more of the questions and give the participants time to think of an answer. These can be done as a written exercise with a choice of keeping the responses anonymous, or the questions can be asked and answered as a group.

The questions deal with group feelings and processes. This exercise may be used in many situations over the lifetime of the group. Ask the following questions and the participants adopt a pose to reflect their answer: How do you feel now? What is your sense of the group? How did the group work together? How do you feel about this session?TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 91Section 4 Additional Facilitator Information This section contains additional information about specific topics that the facilitator can use to support discussion or as a point of information. You should familiarise yourself with this section before planning your course. TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 92E-cigarettes What are e-cigarettes? E-cigarettes, also known as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are electronic devices that heat a liquid (that can contain nicotine) to produce an aerosol which is then inhaled by the user. In Ireland, e-cigarettes are generally sold over the counter in retail premises, and are not approved for sale as a medicinal product. The latest Healthy Ireland Survey (2021) reported that 4% of the population use e-cigarettes. Those aged under 25 are most likely to have used e-cigarettes. Can they help people to quit smoking? Some people may choose to use an e-cigarette to support them in their quit attempt. It is important to note that the current evidence-base on the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a stop smoking aid is \"mixed\" and is still evolving. A Health Research Board (HRB) review into e-cigarettes reported that they were no more effective than approved and regulated nicotine replacement therapy to help people stop smoking. In addition, they can cause harms including burns, poisonings and lung injuries. They also reported that e-cigarettes are associated with adolescents starting to smoke tobacco cigarettes, which could potentially lead to serious harm.21 Therefore, the current recommendation is that people wishing to quit smoking use one of the evidence-based techniques such as behavioural support, NRT, Champix or Zyban, and not e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes are not recommended as a quit smoking aid. There is insufficient evidence to say that they are effective in helping people to quit smoking. 21 Summary report can be found here: https:/ /www.hrb.ie/news/press-releases/single-press-release/article/new-health-research-board- evidence-shows-e-cigarettes-are-associated-with-adolescents-starting-to-sm/TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 93When speaking to participants or those enquiring about the use of e-cigarettes, you can use the following discussion points: E-cigarettes are consumer products. There is some regulation in place to protect consumers but not the same quality and safety system as would be in place for a licensed drug or medical device; People who do not smoke or use e-cigarettes should not start; For people who smoke and want to quit, advise them that there are a range of recommended and accessible support options with well-established effectiveness and safety profiles; Smoking tobacco is extremely dangerous and, compared to this, e-cigarettes are likely to be less harmful. They are not harm-free though, and there is some uncertainty at the moment regarding their health impact; Evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety profile of e-cigarettes as a stop smoking support is evolving; Adolescents who use e-cigarettes are three to five times more likely to start smoking tobacco cigarettes compared to those who never used e-cigarettes; E-cigarettes' acute effects include poisonings, burns, blast injuries, lung injury and asthmatic attacks. Some of the chemicals in e-cigarettes are thought to cause tissue and cell damage and some are agents that may cause cancer in the long-term. The long-term health effects beyond 24 months are not researched yet; Dual use of both e-cigarettes and conventional tobacco cigarettes are more harmful than smoking tobacco cigarettes alone; Dual use of tobacco and e-cigarettes should be avoided. Other Safety & Risk Issues to consider E-cigarettes on their own are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and lung disorders and adverse effects on the development of the foetus during pregnancy; E-cigarettes are undoubtedly harmful, should be strictly regulated and, most importantly, must be kept away from children; Nicotine is highly addictive and found in most e-cigarettes. Both tobacco products and e-cigarettes pose risks to health and the safest approach is not to consume either; 22 Some e-cigarettes look like ordinary cigarettes. The World Health Organisation has expressed concern that e-cigarettes may promote smoking as a gateway product introducing people to smoking. This might have a negative effect on the prevention of tobacco use because of their appearance, sweet flavourings and marketing, as safe alternatives to tobacco products for non-tobacco users, including children. 22 https:/ /www.who.int/news/item/05-02-2020-e-cigarettes-are-harmful-to-healthTFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 94Effects of e-cigarettes on non-users E-cigarettes do not produce second-hand smoke, but they do put substances into the air when they are used. The health impacts on people who breathe in this air are not yet known.23 E-cigarettes and the law E-cigarettes are not sold as tobacco products because they do not contain tobacco, so they are not regulated by Tobacco Control Regulations; E-cigarettes contain nicotine, but they do not come under laws for nicotine replacement therapies because they are not licensed as a medicine to support someone to quit smoking; They do not come under any law for the use and sale of medicines because they are not medicines and they are marketed as smoking alternatives rather than aids to quit; At the moment, there are no methods to safely dispose of e-cigarettes and accessories. E-cigarette cartridges can leak and expose children, adults, pets and the environment to nicotine; In October 2019, the government published the General Scheme of the Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products Bill. The bill when finalised will restrict the sale of tobacco products, thus banning the sale of tobacco products at places or events that are intended for children, and will also ban the sale of e-cigarettes to children. This bill has yet to be finalised. (https:/ /assets.gov.ie/39086/884ae414fa434c2c9ff12447d50e2c21.pdf) Who makes sure they are safe to use in Ireland? They don't come under tobacco law as they don't contain tobacco; E-cigarettes are not covered by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB); In 2016 the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) 24 introduced new rules for manufacturers of nicotine containing products. The TPD rules include maximum nicotine concentration levels and maximum levels of concentration for cartridges, tanks and containers of nicotine. It also requires manufacturers to ensure that e-cigarette ingredients are of high purity and that e-cigarettes deliver the same amount of nicotine for puffs of the same strength and duration. For more information on the full list of rules see: https:/ /www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/tobaccocontrol/tobaccoproductdirective/ Under Regulation 26 of TPD, a manufacturer or importer of an e-cigarette or refill container must submit a notification to the HSE of any such products he or she intends to place on the Irish market and a notification of a new or a substantially modified product must be submitted not less than 6 months before placing it on the Irish market; The Environmental Health Service of the HSE is responsible for the enforcement of many provisions of the legislation. 23 https:/ /www.who.int/news/item/05-02-2020-e-cigarettes-are-harmful-to-health 24 https:/ /www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/tobaccocontrol/tobaccoproductdirective/TFI/Pub 7 Cannabis is a hallucinogen sedative. Also known hashish, blow, pot, ganja, marijuana, grass, joint, THC, bhang, black, blast, blunts, Bob Hope, bush, dope, draw, hemp, herb, puff, northern lights, resin, sensi, smoke, soap, spliff, wacky backy, weed, zero, afghan, Moroccan. is called: sinsemilla, homegrown, buds, tops, nederwiet or netherweed. How is it used? You can smoke it with tobacco in a joint, inhale through a pipe or bong, or make into a tea or food. Herbal cannabis (grass or weed) is common and is generally made from the dried leaves and flowering parts of the female plant and looks like tightly packed dried herbs. Skunk is a general term given to stronger forms of cannabis that contain more THC, (cannabis' active ingredient), than resin or more traditional herbal cannabis. Resin/hash is a black/brown lump made from the resin of the plant. Short term effects You may feel sedated, chilled out and happy. Some people feel sick. You may get \"the munchies\" or feel hungry. Your pulse rate speeds up and blood pressure goes down. Bloodshot eyes, dry mouth. Tiredness. Long term effects May damage your lungs and lead to breathing problems. Has been linked with mental health problems, such as depression and schizophrenia. May lower sperm count and suppress ovulation so may affect fertility. Regular use may affect your memory, mood, motivation and ability to learn. May cause anxiety and paranoia. May affect your coordination and reactions so you are more at risk of accidents, especially if you also drink alcohol. Other dangers As with tobacco, smoking hash may cause cancer. Cannabis psychosis - when you disconnect from reality and start showing symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations even when you are not using drugs.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 96Cannabis and pregnancy Smoking cannabis with tobacco while pregnant carries the same risks to the baby as smoking regular tobacco - smaller birth weight, higher risk of premature (early) birth, and higher risk of miscarriage. The baby may get less oxygen through the placenta. After birth, the baby is at more risk of cot death and early health problems, such as asthma. Is it addictive? You can get psychologically addicted to cannabis, meaning you might find it hard to cope without it. If you smoke it with tobacco, you may get physically addicted to tobacco. Withdrawal Anxiety Irritability Urge or cravings to smoke Sleep problems, restlessness Loss of appetite. How long does it stay in your system? Cannabis will stay in your system for: 7 to 30 days in urine, Up to 90 days in hair, 2 weeks in your blood. Cannabis will show up in a urine test for 2-28 days. The length of time depends on the test used, the amount you take, if you have other medical conditions and your own metabolism. Please use this figure as a guide only. What help is available? Self-help support such as Narcotics Anonymous Counselling or psychotherapy Residential treatment programmes - clinics One-to-one or group family support Contact the Drugs Helpline - 1800 459459 to find out about options in your area.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 97Nicotine Nicotine is a stimulant. It is found in tobacco leaves. It is also used as a natural weed killer. How is it used? Nicotine is a stimulant drug (upper). It is normally taken either through smoking cigarettes or through vaping an e-cigarette. These products contains many harmful chemicals. Short term effects Increases pulse rate and blood pressure. Although smokers feel that it relieves stress and anxiety, it is actually the stress of needing to smoke that is satisfied by the nicotine hit. As it is a stimulant it can suppress appetite. How addictive is nicotine? The World Health Organisation (WHO) ranks nicotine as being more addictive than heroin, cocaine, alcohol, cannabis or caffeine. Tolerance - you need to take more to get the same effect. Other dangers Because nicotine is contained in cigarettes, which contains thousands of other chemicals, there are many dangers associated with it: Higher risk of getting coughs and chest infections. Higher risk of cancer. 90% of all lung cancers are caused by smoking. Smoking is also associated with 30% of other cancers. Chronic breathing problems such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma. Heart attack/stroke. Bad circulation. Ulcers. Increased risk of heart and circulatory problems for women who smoke while on the pill. Increased risk of miscarriage, premature delivery, stillbirth, low birth weight and cot death for women who smoke. Increased risk of morbidity for men with prostate cancer.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 98Roll Your Own Cigarettes (RYO) Roll-your-own cigarettes (also called fine cut tobacco, rollies, roll ups, burns, and hand rolled cigarettes or simply rolls) refers to cigarettes made from loose tobacco and rolling paper. Rather than give up smoking, some smokers may choose to smoke RYO as a cheaper alternative to manufactured cigarettes. Consumption of RYO tobacco products is becoming more common in Ireland, especially among younger people who smoke. The growing trend of 'roll-your-own' (RYO) tobacco use was highlighted in a recent special report by the HSE Tobacco Free Ireland Programme in conjunction with the HSE Environmental Health Service. Figure 1 details the population prevalence of RYO cigarette smoking and manufactured cigarette smoking since 2005, as well as the proportion of current smokers using RYO products. Population prevalence of RYO use has remained at 5% since 2013, however, as overall smoking prevalence decreased, the proportion of current smokers using RYO products has increased steadily and is reported as 31% in 2021. Figure 1: Population prevalence of RYO & manufactured cigarette smoking and proportion of current smokers using RYO products, 2005 to 2021 Source: HSE Smoking Prevalence Tracker Survey, National Tobacco Control Office, HSE Environmental Health Service TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 99Nearly half (46%) of all tobacco users under the age of 25 are using RYO tobacco instead of manufactured cigarettes (see Table 1); Those who are unemployed are much more likely to use RYO compared to those in employment; Males were 2.5 times more likely to use RYO compared to females; Those most likely to use RYO cigarettes are under 25 years of age, male and living in more disadvantaged areas.

These abnormal cells can begin in one part of your body and spread to other body parts. There are many types of cancer. Carbon monoxide Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that is given off when tobacco is smoked. You cannot see or smell it. When you inhale your own tobacco smoke or other people's you take in carbon monoxide through your lungs. Chronic Long-lasting and slow to change. Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy Combination Nicotine Replacement therapy uses 2 forms of Nicotine Replacement Therapy* (NRT), normally the patch which releases nicotine slowly throughout the day and a faster acting NRT such as nicotine gum, inhalator or lozenge. This combination helps the person to have a constant base level of nicotine from the patch and also a second form of NRT to deal with the break through cravings, for example during times of stress, socialising, etc. Contraindication In medicine, a contraindication is a condition that serves as a reason to not to take a certain medical treatment due to the harm that it would cause the person. Dosage The amount of medication to take. E-cigarettes E-cigarettes stands for electronic cigarettes. They are designed to deliver nicotine to a user in the form of a vapour. E-cigarettes have a rechargeable, battery-operated heating element, a cartridge that contains nicotine, and an atomizer which, when heated, turns the contents of the cartridge into a vapour. This vapour is then inhaled by the user. Using e-cigarettes to quit smoking is not recommended as it not an evidence based stop smoking aid. Health 25 Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not just the absence of disease or illness. 25 https:/ /www.who.int/about/who-we-are/constitution TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 101Nicotine Nicotine is a stimulant, which affects many body systems, including the brain, heart and nervous system. It is highly addictive. The body absorbs it very quickly, reaching the brain within 10 - 20 seconds. Nicotine increases the heart rate and blood pressure, leading to the heart needing more oxygen. Nicotine Replacement Therapy Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) provides a small amount of nicotine to help reduce withdrawal symptoms. These treatments can make quitting more comfortable, as they reduce or remove the physical symptoms of withdrawal. NRT can make it easier to quit while you change your habit and attitude towards smoking, which can increase your chances of success. Relapse A relapse means going back to smoking regularly. A slip means having one or two after you quit. Risk Risk means the chance of a person or group of people getting a disease or illness. For example, if a person has a family history of heart disease and has high blood pressure and they smoke, they would have a \"higher risk\" of developing heart disease than someone who did not have a history of heart disease, high blood pressure or smoke. This does not mean that they will develop heart disease though it does mean their risk of getting it is higher. Risk factor Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease. Screening Checking for disease in healthy people. Symptoms A change or feature that you notice in your body.TFI/Pub 7 Revision 1 Oct 2022 HQS0150 102 HSE Quit Team Freephone 1800 201 203 Website www.quit.ie Clinic locator www.quit.ie/I-want-to-quit/support-services HSE stop smoking services provide specialist support to help you quit in community or health services settings.
