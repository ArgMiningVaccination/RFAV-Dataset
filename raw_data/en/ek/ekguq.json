Box 1894, - admin@ich.org, ICH ASSOCIATION 2017 ANNUAL REPORT i ICH Association 2017 Annual Report Prepared by the ICH Secretariat with the ICH Management Committee and MedDRA Management Committee approval of their respective sections. Version dated 8 May 2018 Approved by the ICH A ssembly on 6 June2018 ii Message from Assembly Chair and Vice Chair 2017 was a year of continued growth for the ICH Association which saw the joining of new Regulatory Members CFDA, China and HSA, Singapore . ICH now has a total of 15 Members and 24 Observers, the integration of who is especially visible in the Assembly , where discussions have been enriched through the new perspectives offered . ICH's 23 Working Groups, which at the end of 2017, included over 500 technical experts, are equally enriched , with almost a third of experts now coming from organisations only having joined ICH since the establishment of the Association at the end of 2015. While involving these new organisations in ICH Guideline development is of great importance , equally impor tant for ICH is assist ing g uideline implementation by its Members in order to achieve truly global harmonisation. 2017 saw significant steps taken in support of this goal with activities such as the establishment of an Implementation Subcommittee and the l aunch of a training pilot with particular focus on ICH \" Tier 1\" and \" Tier 2\" Guidelines. ICH hopes that these new activities will be beneficial to international harmonisation efforts as ICH and its Members work together to improve global public health and facilitate patient access to safe, eff ective and quality medicines. As Chair and Vice -Chair of the Assembly we are delighted to have the opportunity to see ICH through its continued evolution following our re -election by the Assembly in November 2017 for a second 2-year term.

About ICH 1.1. Purpose & Aims The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use ( ICH ) is an international non -profit organisation which was established as an a ssociation under Swiss law in October 2015. The purpose of ICH is to promote public health through international harmonisation of technical requirements that contributes to the timely introduction of new medicines and continued availability of the approved medicines to patients, to the prevention of unnecessary duplication of clinical trials in humans, to the development, registration and manufacturing of safe, effective, and high quality medicines in an efficient and cost - effective manner, and to the minimization of the use of animal testing without compromising safety and effectiveness. The ICH's aims are the following: To make recommendations t owards achieving greater harmonisation in the interpretation and application of technical guidelines and requirements for pharmaceutical product registration and the maintenance of such registrations; To maintain a forum for a constructive dialogue on scie ntific issues between regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry on the harmonisation of the technical requirements for pharmaceutical products; To contribute to the protection of public health in the interest of patients from an international perspective; To monitor and update harmonised technical requirements leading to a greater mutual acceptance of research and development data; To avoid divergent future requirements through harmonisation of selected topics needed as a result of therapeutic advances and the development of new technologies for the production of medicinal products; To facilitate the adoption of new or improved technical research and development approaches which update or replace current practices; To encourage the implementatio n and integration of common standards through the dissemination of, the communication of information about and provision of training on, harmonised guidelines and their use; And to develop policy for the ICH Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology ( MedDRA ) whilst ensuring the scientific and technical maintenance, development and dissemination of MedDRA as a standardised dictionary which facilitates the sharing of regulatory information internationally for medicinal products used by humans. -2- 1.2. Organisational Structure The bodies of the ICH Association are the: Assembly ; ICH Management Committee ; MedDRA Management Committee; ICH Secretariat and Auditors . Although not a body of the Association, ICH Coordinators play an important role in supporti ng the work of ICH. Assembly The Assembly brings together all Members and Observers of the ICH Association. It is the overarching governing body of ICH and adopts decisions in particular on matters such as the ICH Articles of Association, admission of ne w Members and Observers and adoption of ICH Guidelines. The full list of Assembly Member Representatives and Observer Delegates as of December 31, 2017 is provided in Annex I. ICH Management Committee The ICH Management Committee is the body that oversees operational aspects of ICH on behalf of all Members, including administrative and financial matters and oversight of the Working Groups (WGs). The ICH Management Committee is responsible for submitting recommendations or proposals to the Assembly in prepa ration of Assembly discussions. The full list of the ICH Management Committee Member Representatives and Observe r Delegates as of December 31 , 2017 is provided in Annex II. -3- MedDRA Management Committee1 The MedDRA Management Committee has responsibility for direction of MedDRA , the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, ICH's standardised medical terminology. The full list of MedDRA Management Committee Representatives and Observer Delegates as of December 31 , 2017 is provided in Annex III . ICH Secretariat The ICH Secretariat is responsible for day- to-day management of ICH, coordinating ICH activities as well as providing support to the Assembly, ICH Management Committee and its WGs . The ICH Secretariat also provides support for the MedDRA Management Committee as the \"MedDRA Secretariat\". The full list of ICH Secretariat Staff as of Decembe r 31, 2017 is provided in Annex IV. Auditors In 2016, the Assembly agreed to appoint Moore Stephens Refidar SA for an initial period of 2 years to audit the annual financial statements of the ICH Association. ICH Coordinators Fundamental to the smooth running of ICH has been the designation of an ICH Coordinator per ICH Member to act as the main contact point with the ICH Secretariat. Coordinators ensure proper distr ibution of ICH documents to the appropriate persons from their organisation and are responsible for the follow up on actions within their respective organisation within assigned deadlines. They also assist communication between the ICH Management Committee and/or Assembly and the ICH WGs as needed. The full list of ICH Coordinators as of Decembe r 31, 2017 is provided in Annex V. 1 In 2017 , in view of the fact that MedDRA's ownership only transferred from trustee IFPMA to the new ICH Association in November , both the new MedDRA Management Committee and the former MedDRA Management Board operated in parallel until November , with the MedDRA Management Committ ee only being responsible prior to this for MedDRA decision -making pertaining to items relevant for the ICH Association. -4- 2. 2017 Overview of ICH Membership & Observership 2.1. Continued Expansion of ICH Membership & Observership A driving factor of the orga nisational change celebrated by ICH at the end of 2015 was to make ICH a truly global initiative . 2017 built upon 2016's success in expanding ICH's reach, with the addition of more new Members and Observers, bringing ICH to a total of 15 Members and 24 Obs ervers , thereby further expanding the forum for dialogue on scientific issues between regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry on the harmonisation of the technical requirements for pharmaceuticals products. These new Members and Observers h ave demonstrated great interest in participating in the activiti es of ICH, something which is particularly evident looking at ICH's WGs . At the end of 2017 these WGs involved the participation of over 500 technical experts , with almost a third of these exp erts coming from new ICH Members and Observers . Overview of Expert Participation in ICH , as of 7 November 2017 -5- While the expansion of ICH is celebrated by all involved, it also brings the challenge of ensur ing the continued smooth operation of the Ass embly and ICH WGs. In 2017, the ICH Management Committee carefully oversaw the appointment of experts to ICH WGs , weighing decisions on the addition of new experts against the size of WGs and the status of work, which sometimes meant not all requests to ap point experts could be accommodated. This is an area which the ICH Management Committee will continue to work on 2018. 2.2. New Members & Observers Approved in 2017 The Assembly approved 2 new ICH Regulatory Members in 2017, based on the recommendation of the I CH Management Committee: CFDA, China HSA, Singapore ICH Assembly Montreal, Canada, June meeting Left to right: Mr. Xiangyu Wang (CFDA, China), Ms. Lenita Lindstr\u00f6m -Gommers Europe), (MHLW/PMDA, Japan), Theresa Mullin (FDA , US), Mr. Yuan Lin (CFDA, China), Dr. Wei Zhou (CFDA, China) . ICH Assembly Geneva , Switzerland , November meeting Left to right: Dr. Theresa Mullin (FDA, US), Dr. Dorothy Toh (HSA, Singapore), Ms. Lenita Lindstr\u00f6m - Gommers (EC, Europe), Dr. Toshiyoshi Tom inaga (MHLW/PMDA, Japan) . -6- 3 New Observers were also approved by the Assembly in 2017 based on the recommendation of the ICH Management Committee: INVIMA, Colombia PIC/S The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation In addition to these approved Membership and Obse rvership applications, in 2017 the Assembly also considered a number of other applications from organisations which did not meet the eligibility criteria . The ICH Management Committee also coordinated with the ICH Secretariat in 2017 to respond to further enquiries regarding interest in ICH Membership and Observership from organisations/individuals which in line with the procedures would not be eligible . 2.3. Participation of IFPMA National Association Experts In 2017, the Assembly welcomed IFPMA 's implementatio n of a process to enable IFPMA national association experts to participate in ICH WGs , making use of IFPMA's right as a Standing Observer to appoint one expert to each WG. This is an important step in connecting with industry stakeholders from the countrie s/regions of ICH's new Regulatory Members. 2.4. Communication of ICH Membership Further to t he ICH Management Committee 's approval in 2016 of a new ICH Member Logo, the ICH Management Committee gave its support in 2017 to the translation of the word \"Member\". T his will enable ICH Members to communicate their Membership in ICH in their own language within their own publications, presentations or on their website s after the signing of a disclaimer. 3. 2017 ICH Harmonisation Activities A major output of ICH's wor k, in line with the specific aims of the organis ation , is the development of harmonised technical g uidelines on Quality, Safety Efficacy and Multidisciplinary topics. In 2017, these activities were progressed on 24 topics by technical WG s [including Expert Working Groups (EWG), Impl ementation Working Groups (IWG) and a Discussion Group (DG)], with support from the ICH Secretariat and under the oversight of the ICH Management Committee, with reporting to the Assembly. These activities were progressed via email and teleconferences, with some of the WGs being approved to -7- meet face- to-face by the ICH Management Committee to progress their activities at the time of ICH's biannual meetings in 2017. The ICH WGs which met in 2017 are presented in Annex V I. The key outcomes in 2017 relat ing to ICH harmonisation efforts include: Completion at Step 4 of the ICH process and finalisation of work on: 2 New ICH Guidelines 2 Revised ICH Guidelines 2 New Questions & Answers ( Q&A ) Documents 2 Updated Q&A Documents 1 New User Guide Reaching of Step 2a/b of the ICH process and completion of drafts of: 1 New Guideline 2 Revised ICH Guidelines 1 New topic and 1 Revision approved for development An overview of all ICH WG activities and accomplishments in 2017 is pre sented in Annex VI I. 3.1. ICH Guidelines & Other Documents Adopted at Step 4 in 201 7 The following ICH Guidelines and other documents were adopted by the Regulatory Members of the Assembly at Step 4 of the ICH process in 2017 following the reaching of consens us within the respective ICH WG s and sign -off by the Regulatory Member experts of these WGs under Step 3 . ICH E2B (R3) Guideline - Clinical Safety Data Management: Data Elements for Transmission of Indivi dual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) The ICH E2B(R3) Guideline aims to standardise the essential clinical safety data with recommendation on their specifications for electronic transmission. In 2017, the following final documents were adopted: Additional Q&As v2.1 in the ICSR Implementation Guide package Code Lists : #9, #14 and #26 EDQM Dose Form and Route of Administration Term User Guide -8- ICH E11 (R1) Guideline - Addendum: Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population The finali sation of the Addendum to the ICH E11 Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the pediatric population addresses new scientific and technical knowledge advances in pediatric drug development and updates certain aspects of the ICH E11 Guideline adopted in 2000. The ICH E11(R1) amendment includes guidance on ethical considerations, age classifications and subgroups for children, pediatric formulations and guidance on extrapolation in pediatric drug development and trial design. ICH E 17 Guideline - General Principles for planning and Des ign of Multi -Regional Clinical Trials The finali sation of the new ICH E17 Guideline on the planning and design of multi - regional clinical trials (MRCTs) is intended to facilitate the acceptability of MRCTs as part of global regulatory submissions in ICH a nd non- ICH regions, as well as making it easier to seek approval of global trials. Facilitating the conduct and acceptability of MRCTs is expected to have a direct public health benefit, in particular by encouraging more predictability around the approval of trials and the use of clinical trial data from a greater variety of countries and regions. ICH E18 Guideline - Genomic Sampling and Management of Genomic Data The finali sation of the new E18 ICH Guideline on genomic sampling and management of genomic data clarifies that genomic data should be collected in clinical trials and other studies in accordance with certain methodologies during drug development and throughout the product life cycle; the guideline also covers the storage and retention of genomic samples. ICH S3A Guideline - Q&As: Note for Guidance on Toxicokinetics: The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies The final Q&A document on the ICH S3A Guideline aims to facilitate the implementation of the guideline and promote the use of new micro -sampling techniques in toxicokinetic assessment to contribute to the improvement of animal welfare, for example by reducing pain and distress in animals and the number of animals used in studies. The Q&A document also contributes to the more prec ise evaluation of the relationship between safety data and drug exposure in animals in drug development. ICH Q11 Guideline - Q&As: Selection and Justification of starting Materials for the Manufacture of Drug Substances This final Q&A document is intended to provide additional clarification and promote convergence on the considerations for the selection and justification of starting materials, and on the information that should be provided in marketing authorisation -9- applications and/or Master Files. The focus of the Q&A document is on chemical entity drug substances. ICH M7(R1) Guideline - Addendum : Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals to Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk The final M7(R1) Addendum to the guidelin e on assessment and control of DNA reactive (mutagenic) impurities in pharmaceuticals to limit potential carcinogenic risk provides a list of compounds for which mutagenic potential and the threshold of toxicological concern have been established . ICH M8 - Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) ICH M8 is a technical standard and Implementation Guide to facilitate the exchange of regulatory information prepared in accordance with the requirements of the CTD in the ICH regions . The M8 EWG/IWG in charge of this standard also assumes the responsibility for the implementation and maintenance of eCTD , as well as development and maintenance of other related document s such as Q&As and Study Tagging File specifications. All electronic standards document s are available on the Electronic Standards for Transfer of Regulatory Information (ESTRI) at http://estri.ich.org . In 2017, several documents related M8 eCTD were adopted: The eCTD v2.3 eCTD The eCTD v4.0 Q&A and Change Request Document v1.1 3.2. ICH Guidelines & Other Documents Endorsed at Step 2a/b in 201 7 In 2017 the following ICH Guidelines and other documents were endorsed first at Step 2a of the ICH process by all Members of the Assembly, followed by endorsement at Step 2b by the Regulatory Members of the Assembly. This endorsement followed the reaching of consensus within the respective ICH WGs and sign- off by all Member experts of these WGs , under Step 1 . ICH E9 Guideline - Addendum: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials The draft ICH E9(R1) Addendum on defining appropriate estimands for a clinical trial/sensitivity analyses published for regulatory public consultation in 2017 seeks to promote harmonised standards on the choice of estimand in clinical trials and define an agreed framework for planning, conducting and interpreting sensitivity analyses of clinical trial data. -10- ICH Q12 Guideline - Technical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Management The new draft ICH Q12 Guideline , which includes 2 Annexes , on pharmaceutical product lifecycle management published for regulatory public consultation in 2017, serves to provide guidance on a framework to facilitate the management of chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) changes to approved medicines . In addition to providing more predictability for handling CMC changes, the Q12 Guideline is intended to contribute to public health by promoting innovation and the continual improvement of medicines. ICH S5(R3) Guideline - Revision: Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Human Pharmaceuticals The draft revised ICH S5(R3) Guideline on the detection of toxicity to r eproduction for human pharmaceuticals published for regulatory public consultation in 2017 seeks to enhance human risk assessment, while also potentially reducing animal use . The revision uses experience gained since the last revision in 2000 with the test ing of pharmaceuticals as well as developments in scientific, technological and regulatory knowledge. 3.3. Other Working Groups Outputs The following highlights other noteworthy outputs of ICH WGs in 2017 outside of those items produced as part of the ICH step process. In March and September, the ICH M1 Point to Consider (PtC) WG upda ted the two MedDRA PtC documents on Term Selection and Data Retrieval and Presentation with MedDRA release versions 20.0 and 20.1. The M2 EWG on finalised a new PDF specification for publication on the ESTRI website at http://estri.ich.org . 3.4. New Harmonisation Activities 3.4.1. Strategic Reflection Papers In 2017, the ICH Management Committee supported the following activities in relation to the Strategic Reflection Papers aimed at identifying potential areas of work: Further to Assembly support, in January 2017 ICH shared a Reflection Paper on the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Renovation via the ICH website and invited public review and comments which were then taken into consideration by the ICH Management Committee in determining the approach. The goal of the GCP Renovation is to provide updated guidance that is both appropri ate and flexible enough to address the increasing diversity of study types and data sources that are being employed to support regulatory and other health policy decisions, as appropriate. The underlying principles of human subject protection and data quality would remain . Included in the GCP Renovation approach is the revision -11- of the 1997 ICH E8 Guideline on General Considerations for Clinical Trials which is one of the new topic proposals approved by the Assembly in 2017 (see below) Further development by PhRMA of a Quality Reflection Paper on Advancing Pharmaceutical Quality Standards . Initiation of work by PhRMA to develop Reflection Papers on Model Informed Drug Development (MIDD) and Patient Focused Drug Development (PF DD) focused on technical issues e .g., related to the development and use of Patient Reported Outcomes . The initiation of work by EC, Europe on a Vaccines Reflection Paper, and FDA, US on a Generic Drug Harmonisation Reflection Paper. To put on hold work to further consider the development of a Reflection Paper on Compliance of Reliability for Electronic Records, which had been led by JPMA , with agreement to task the M2 EWG to watch this potential issue as part of its remit to review the external environment. 3.4.2. Approval of 2 New Efficacy Wo rk Items In 2017, using the process established in 2016 for the selection of new topics proposed for harmonisation by ICH Members and Observers, the ICH Management Committee and its New Topics Subcom mittee assessed 16 new topic proposals which had been submitted by a mid-January 2017 deadline. Further to this , a short -list of 8 proposals was prepared for the Assembly, and following prioritisation by the ICH Management Committee , 2 Efficacy topic proposals were recommended having received the highest scores in the ICH Management Committee's prioritisation. Based on the ICH M anagement Committee recommendation, the Assembly approved the following new harmonisation activities : ICH E8(R1) Guideline - Revision of General Considerations for Clinical Trials The revision of the ICH E8 Guideline on general considerations for clinical trials which is part of ICH's GCP Renovation plan will look at study design, planning and conduct, with a focus on identifying and supporting a basic set of critical -to-quality factors. In complement of its work on the ICH E8(R1) Guideline, the E8(R1) EWG will also be involved in the development of a GCP Stakeholder Engagement Plan in collaboration with the Communication Subcommittee of the ICH Management Committee, with agreement already reached to hold a meeting with stakeholders at the end of Step 2b, likely in June 2019. The Assembly adopted the E 8(R1) Concept Paper outline at it s meeting in Montreal in June 2017, following which an informal WG worked to finalise the Concept Paper and Business Plan which were then endorsed by the ICH Management Committee at its meeting in Geneva in November 2017. The Assembly appointed FDA , US as Rapporteur . -12- ICH E11A Guideline - Paediatric Extrapolation Development of the new ICH E11A Guideline aim s to further advance the use of paediatric extrapolation providing guidance on incorporating extrapolation methods in an overall approach to paediatric medicinal product development. A harmonised approach to the appropriate use of extrapolation from adult data aims to improve the speed of access to new drugs for children. The Assembly adopted the E11A Concept Paper outline at it s meeting in Montreal in June 2017, following which an informal WG worked to finalise the Concept Paper and Business Plan which wer e then endorsed by the ICH Management Committee in October 2017. The Assembly appointed FDA , US as Rapporteur . 3.4.3. Process Refinement & Strategic Themes Further to the conduct of the new topic selection process in 2017 which resulted in the recommendation to t he Assembly of 2 topic proposals, the process was further refined in 2017 by the ICH Management Committee ahead of the 2018 cycle . Additionally, the ICH Management Committee further clarified in 2017 the procedure related to the linkage between Reflection Papers and individual new topic proposals and supported planning of future new topics organised by theme. The ICH Management Committee also agreed to hold an interim meeting of its New Topics Subcommittee in 2018 to facilitate timely communication with th e Assembly on new t opic proposals and also agree d to provide the Assembly all proposals submitted, along with the ICH Management Committee 's considerations forming the background to the prioritisation of each topic. 3.4.4. Other New Harmonisation Activities In 2017, the following additional new harmonisation activities received the support of the Assembly and/or ICH Management Committee: Q3C(R7) Maintenance EWG: Maintenance of the Guideline for Residual Solvents : The Assembly endorsed the ICH Management Committee recommendation for the EWG to develop Permitted Daily Exposures ( PDEs ) for tert -butanol. Standing Paediatric Management Committee supported establishing a Standing Paediatric EWG to act as a continuous resource available for expert consultation and guidance to other WGs charged with developing new or revised Guidance which may be of relevance to paediatric drug development. -13- 3.5. Implementation of ICH Guidelines The aim and intention is that all ICH Regulators should implement all ICH Guidelines . At the time of Membership application to ICH , each Regulator is expected to have implemented the ICH Q 1, ICH Q7 and ICH E6 Guidelines \"Tier 1 \" ICH Guidelines and have sp ecific plans with identified milestones and timeframes for implementation of the following \"Tier 2\" ICH Guidelines the next M4 (CTD) and M1 (MedDRA) . The other, remaining ICH Guidelines should be implemented in the near te rm and as soon as possible. During 2017, implementation activity by ICH Regulatory Members was high, with Step 5 (implementation) of the ICH process being reached 2 7 times for new and existing ICH Guidelines by both new and old ICH Members. ICH Guideline implementation information (both on final implemented ICH Guidelines and draft ICH Guidelines undergoing public regulatory consultation) is published on the ICH website www.ich.org under each ICH Guideline section for Fo unding and Standing Regulatory Members . Information from new Regulator y Members will be added in 2018 following work by the ICH Secretariat in 2017 to compile information from new Regulatory Members in a tabulated format for easy consultation by the Assemb ly and ICH Management Committee. To further facilitate the goal of enabling the Assembly to monitor ICH Guideline implementation and the progress of international harmonisation , and to achieve a common understanding on the meaning of implementation, the following activities received the support of the Assembly and/or ICH Management Committee in 2017: The ICH Management Committee supported the creation of an Implementation Subcommittee , to work in particular on the definition of the different levels of imple mentation, and potential metrics that could be used to monitor the implementation of ICH Guidelines. The Assembly supported an ICH -driven survey on ICH Guideline implementation to be led by an independent third party . The ICH Management Committee agreed t hat the Implementation Subcommittee also work on defining the scope of an ICH -driven implementation survey. 3.6. Training on ICH Guidelines ICH recognises that training is important to the successful and consistent implementation of ICH Guidelines globally. -14- 3.6.1. ICH Training Strategy In 2017, work was further progressed by an ICH Management Committee Training Subcommittee on an ICH training strategy , with launch of a pilot programme in partnership with a small group of training providers. This work is considered important to ensure high quality training is available based upon the scientific and regulatory principles outlined in ICH Guidelines to facilitate the goal of achieving global harmonised implementation of ICH Guidelines . 2017 saw close to 10 training cou rses conducted by training p roviders in accordance with ICH established Terms of Reference. Training providers selected on the basis of ICH established selection criteria included : DIA (Drug Information Association) ; RAPS (Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society) ; NEU (Northeastern University) ; Duke -NUS (Duke University - National University of Singapore ); Harvard MRCT (Multi- Regional Clinical Trials) Center; and AHC (APEC Harmonization Center). The following decisions were taken by the Assembly and/or ICH Management Committee in 2017 in relation to this work: The ICH Management Committee supported Terms of Reference for the training pilot and eligibility criteria for the selection of training providers. The ICH Management Committee supported the use of a new logo \"ICH Recognised Training Programme\" to be made available to training providers for use on training programmes having the support of the Training Subcommittee following signature of a disclaimer provided by the ICH Secretariat. Following the success ful running of the pilot, t he Assembly and ICH Management Committee in November 2017 supported continuing work with the training partners of the pilot in accordance with Revised Terms of Reference. The Assembly and ICH Management Committee also supported t he development of online training programmes and continued focussi ng of the training strategy on Tier 1 and Tier 2 ICH Guidelines . The Assembly supported the allocation of funds in the budget for training purposes for the next 5 years . 3.6.2. Training Materials D eveloped by ICH Working Groups Support was also provided by the Assembly and ICH Management Committee in 2017 for several WGs to develop training materials to help assist understanding of new concepts and implementation of their respective ICH Guidelines . In 2017, the following received the support of the Assembly and/or ICH Management Committee: ICH E17 Guideline - General Principles for planning and Design of Multi - Regional Clinical Trials: Following adoption of the final ICH E17 Guideline by the Assembly under Step 4 in November 2017, the ICH Management Committee gave agreement in principle for the EWG to be converted to an IWG for training purposes -15- and tasked the EWG with developing a Concept Paper with this focus for approval by the ICH Managemen t Committee in early 2018. ICH E9 (R1) Draft Guideline - Addendum: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials : Accompanying endorsement by the Assembly under Step 2a/b of the d raft Guideline Addendum in August 2017, the ICH Management Committee supported that the EWG develop a communication video to present the Estimand concept and agreed the allocation of a small budget for this purpose from the overall training budget . 3.6.3. Working Group Step 2/Step 4 Presentations In line with ICH procedures, when an ICH Guide line reaches Step 2b or Step 4 of the ICH process , each ICH WG develops a presentation to be included by the ICH Secretariat in a library of presentations and implementation materials made available on the ICH website. In 2017, the ICH Secretariat updated the ICH website accordingly with the presentations developed by WGs who reached Step 2b or Step 4. 3.7. MedDRA Activities MedDRA, the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities , is a rich and highly specific standardised medical terminology developed by ICH to facilitate sharing of regulatory information internationally for medical products used by humans. It is used for registration, documentation and safety monitoring of medical products both before and after a product has been authorised for use . 2017 was a successful year of continued g rowth and development of MedDRA which now has over 5,000 subscribing organisations in 110 countries worldwide . 3.7.1. Overview of 2017 MedDRA Management & Key Decisions Up until November 2017, both a MedDRA Management Board a nd MedDRA Management Committee ran in parallel, following which MedDRA's formal ownership was assigned to the ICH Association from IFPMA (as trustee of the former International Conference on Harmonisation Steering Committee) and the MedDRA Management Board , established under the former ICH, ceased to operate . Prior to this assignment, the MedDRA Management Board was responsible for overseeing the main activities of the MSSO (Maintenance and Support Services -16- Organisation) in 2017, as well as providing overs ight and direction to the MedDRA Secretariat. The MedDRA Management Board also addressed the necessary legal and fiscal matters along with the ICH Manag ement Committee and Secretariat to enable the transfer of MedDRA, as part of the overall transfer of ICH assets, from IFPMA to the new ICH Association. Prior to the assignment , the MedDRA Management Committee was responsible only for MedDRA matters related to the new ICH Association , but subsequently it fully assumed all MedDRA m anagement responsibilities . The following key decisions were taken in 201 7 related to MedDRA's management: Financial: The MedDRA Management Board approved the r eport of the MSSO Financial Audit for the years 2015 and 2016 which was conducted by an international auditing firm under t he direction of the MedDRA Management Board. The MedDRA Management Committee approved the 2018 MSSO Subscription fees for presentation to the Assembly as part of the 2018 Budget for its approval , with the granting of a 5% reduction for the 2018 subscription rates for lower - revenue users (commercial levels 0 to 2A ).

The MedDRA Management Committee provided its support for the MedDRA Secretariat to proceed with implementing an updated trademark strategy for the MedDRA name mark and the MedDRA logo (device) mark in consideration of factors, including the expanded global use of MedDRA. MSSO/JMO Sub -Licensing Agreement: The MedDRA Management Committee approved amendment of the s ub-licensing agreement between MSSO/JMO (Japanese Maintenance Organisation ) for sign - off by MSSO and JMO. The amendment provides alignment with the new contract between the ICH Association and the MSSO Contractor to come into effect upon the transfer of MedDRA's ownership to ICH from I FPMA. In line with the sub-licensing agreement between MSSO/JMO , the MedDRA Management Board in discussion with the Japanese Management Board agreed the annual 2017 fee to be paid by JMO to the MSSO. Facilitating Global Use of MedDRA: The MedDRA Management Board provided its support for the development of a Russian MedDRA translation in coordination with Roszdravnadzor , Russia with development of the translation by a translation firm under the MSSO, with review and input into the translation by Roszdravnadz or, Russia. The MedDRA M anagement Committee agreed the provision of MSSO local support in countries and regions with an increasing number of subscribers, namely the Republic of Korea and Central America in 2018, and China in 2019, which -17- will see MSSO provi ding in -country/region MedDRA experts who speak the local language . The MedDRA Management Committee oversaw work by the MedDRA Secretariat to arrange the transfer in November 2017 of copyright in a new Korean MedDRA translation from MFDS, Republic of Korea who had taken the lead to develop this new translation which is planned for release to all MedDRA users by early 2019. Development of SMQs: The MedDRA Management Board approved 2 new Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQs) - the SMQ Dehydration and the SMQ Inf ective pneumonia, and four new level 4 SMQs in the SMQ Malignancies for release to MedDRA users. The addition of these new SMQs result in a total of 102 SMQs develope d to-date by a CIOMS WG on SMQs. The MedDRA Management Committee support ed the renewal for another year of the Memo randum of Understanding ICH has with the CIOMS to develop SMQs . The MedDRA Management Committee reflected on the future of SMQ development in consideration that the majority of common medical concepts have already been developed as SMQs, and provided its support for a pilot of a new approach for ad hoc SMQ development involving the seeking of input on new SMQ requests from the ICH MedDRA Points to Consider (PtC) WG on whether to progress any requests as SMQs. 3.7.2. Oversight of 2017 MedDR A MSSO Activities A summary is provided as follows on the main activities of the MSSO related to MedDRA development and support of MedDRA users in 2017, which were overseen up until November by the MedDRA Management Board , and thereafter by the MedDRA Mana gement Committee : Conduct of over 90 training courses for MSSO MedDRA user s, including regulators, with over 3,000 people trained via webinars, as well as 63 face -to- face training courses provided in multiple locations worldwide, including Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Japan (via the JMO) , Mexico, Russia and the United States .

ICH Funding ICH F inancial Audit In line with the ICH Articles of Association, the Assembly took the decision in 2016 to appoint Moore Ste phens Refidar SA for an initial period of 2 years to audit the annual financial statements of the ICH Association. The audit of the first financial period (23 October 2015 to 31 December 2016) was conducted in 2017. In June 2017, the Assembly approved the audited accounts of the ICH Association for this first period and the auditor's consideration that the statements complied with Swiss law and the ICH's Articles of Association. Furthermore, th e Assembly approved the overall closing statement of ICH's 2016 financial activities, taking into account a consolidated view of information fro m the new ICH Association and activities via IFPMA as trustee of the former ICH Steering Committee, pending completion of the transfer of ICH assets. Tax Exemption In October 2017, in view of ICH's standing as a non -profit Swiss Association in line with its Articles of Association, ICH was granted a tax exemption by the Geneva tax authorities making it exempt from Geneva cantonal and Swiss federal tax. ICH Funding In line with the ICH Articles of Association, 2017 remained a second transitional year for the ICH Association, where the ICH Management Committee ensured the funding of the ICH Association, ahead of the implementation starting in 2018 of Membership Fees for all ICH Members in line with the decision taken by the Assembly in 2016. In 2017, ICH Membership Fees were payable according to Table 1 below: Membership Category Membership Fee (CHF / Swiss Franc) Founding Regulatory Member CHF 233,000 Founding Industry Member CHF 233,000 Standing Regulatory Member CHF 96,000 Regulatory Member N/A in 2017 (to start in 2018) Industry Member N/A in 2017(to start in 2018) Standing Observer N/A Observer N/A Table 1: 201 7 Membership Fees In May 2017, the Assembly approved a provisional 2018 ICH Budget, and in November approved a revised 2018 ICH Budget co vering additional costs including those related to major upgrades to the ICH website s; ICH logo (device) trademark -23- registration; Secretariat travel to the interim ICH Management Committee meeting ; funding of the ICH meeting reception; and an additional Sec retariat staff of 1 FTE to account for the growing need of ICH for Secretariat support in particular for training activities . MedDRA Funding MedDRA activities are self -financed through the collection of annual subscription fees from organisations which ar e subscribers to MedDRA. In November 2017, t he Assembly approved the 2018 MedDRA Budget , which included a 5% reduction for the 2018 MSSO MedDRA Subscription fees for users of Commercial levels 0 to 2A, on the basis of a recommendation from the MedDRA Mana gement Committee. (See also Section 3.7 above on MedDRA Activities .) 5.3. Asset Transfer On 10 November 2017 an important step was taken in fully operationalizing the new ICH Association , with the ICH Management Committee providing its support for the completio n of the transfer of assets to the ICH Association from IFPMA as trustee of the former ICH (International Conference on Harmonisation) Steering Committee. With the completion of the transfer, ownership in assets including MedDRA, funds and contracts passed to the ICH Association, paving the way for the undertaking of follow -up administrative steps by the ICH Secretariat, such as the seeking of trademark assignments with the competent trademark authorities in each of the jurisdictions where a MedDRA trademar k had been registered by IFPMA in its capacity as trustee. (See also Section 5.7 below on ICH Secretariat Activities.) 5.4. ICH Communication In 2017, work was progressed in view of further enhancing communication and transparency with stakeholders on ICH activ ities, with the following important steps taken by the Assembly and/or ICH Management Committee: The ICH Management Committee agreed the publication on the ICH website of the names of all active EWG/IWG experts , along with the names of each EWG/IWG 's Regul atory Chair and Rapporteur. Inclusion of a disclaimer was also supported by the ICH Management Committee to clarify that experts are appointed by their nominating ICH Member or Observer party and are responsible for representing the views of that party, which may not necessarily reflect their personal views. The ICH Management Committee supported an ICH Transparency Policy , which included publication on the ICH website of a set of Q&As on transparency on a new transparency page , as well as publication of photographs and biographies of the Member Representatives and Observer D elegates of the ICH Management Committee, MedDRA Management Co mmittee and Assembly, as well as those of ICH Coordinators and t he ICH Secretariat. -24- The ICH Management Committee furthermore supported that consideration be given to Training and Stakeholder needs at the outset of any new ICH harmonisation topic, with approval of a recommendation from its Communication Subcommittee to add a new section on this in the Concept Paper and Business Plan templates . These plans and others were supported by the Assembly along with a 2017- 2018 Communication and Stakeholder Engagement Plan. ICH Regional Public Meetings While ICH no longer organi ses the large international ICH Conferences that it did between 1991 and 2003, public meetings are still considered important for disseminating information of ICH activities. ICH Members periodically hold dedicated ICH regional public meetings , either inde pendently or in collaboration with other non- profit organisations. Information on these meetings is made available by the ICH Secretariat on the ICH website. It should be noted, that i n addition to these regional public meetings, ICH Members were also acti ve in finding opportunities to present on ICH and its Guideline s in other fora in 2017. In 2017, Members held the followi ng ICH regional public meetings: Brazil ANVISA, Brazil organised a meeting in July 2017 to raise awareness of stakeholders in Brazil of its ICH membership and the process of implementation of the ICH Guidelines. Japan JPMA in collaboration with MHLW/PMDA , Japan organised ICH regional public meeting s in Japan on 30 June and 15 December to report from the preceding ICH meetings. United States & Canada Health Canada, Canada and the FDA , US held joint public meetings ahead of each of the 2017 ICH meetings. The first was held in Silver Spring, MD, US on 24 April to which participants were also able to participate by webcast. The second was he ld in Ottawa, Canada on 19 O ctober. 5.5. Elected ICH Management Committee Representatives In accordance with the ICH Articles of Association, the intent was for the ICH Management Committee to open to membership from Elected ICH Management Committee Representa tives by 1 January 2018. Following discussion at the November 2017 meeting, the Assembly agreed to postpone the election until the next Assembly meeting in June 2018 in acknowledgement of the need for the eligibility criteria to be further clarified . Subse quently, the ICH Management Committee started revising its RoP in order to clarify the notion of a \"good record of implementation\" which is stated in both the Assembly and ICH Management Committee RoP as a prer equisite for eligibility -25- as an E lected ICH Management Committee Representative. The revised ICH Management Committee RoP were adoptedin December 2017 with this clarification. 5.6. Cooperation with the IPRP In 2017, the Assembly and ICH Management Committee gave support for the ICH Secretariat to provide s upport services to the IPRP (International Pharmaceutical Regulators Programme) to be funded by ICH Regulatory Members, starting from January 2018 which will be conducted and financed separately from the support of ICH activities. The IPRP is a consolidati on of the International Generic Drug Regulators Programme (IGDRP) and the International Pharmaceutical Regulators Forum (IPRF) involving many of the drug regulatory authorities already involved in ICH . IPRP is a venue promoting regulatory cooperation and c onvergence but also for discussions amongst regulators on ICH Guideline implementation. 5.7. ICH Secretariat Staffing The following highlights key points and decisions related to ICH/MedDRA Secretariat staffing in 2017: Secretariat staffing was planned at 6 FT Es (Full Time Equivalents) for 2017 (compared with 4.8 FTE in 2016) , allocated between support for ICH activities ( 4.2 FTEs) and MedDRA activities (1.8 FTEs). The Secretariat however operated at less than full capacity in 2017, with approximately 5 FTEs over the full year, due to delays in the hiring of new staff, staff leave and staff departures . The year saw the hiring of Dr. V\u00e9ronique Kuntzelmann in January , who filled until November 2017 the Manager position left vacant end of 2016 by Dr. Sarah Adam , and the hiring of Dr. Anne Latrive in May, in a newly created Manager position approved by the ICH Management Committee aimed at increasing the capacity of the ICH Secretariat in view of new tasks including the provision of support to the IPRP (see Section 5.6 above ). In November 2017, the ICH Management Committee supported additional resources be allocated to the ICH Secretariat to account for the growing need for Secretariat support of the training activities and other new activities assigned to the ICH Secretariat, and agreed to add 1 FTE from 2018 to enable the ICH Secretariat to support these activities . Support of Asset Transfer and Operationalising the ICH Association In 2017, work was progressed by the ICH Secretariat under the direction of the ICH Management Committee and MedDRA Management Committee to complete the transfer of assets from IFPMA as trustee of the former ICH ( International Conference on Harmonisation ) Steering Committee , and towards making the ICH Association fully -26- operational. The ICH S ecretariat was supported in this work by external advisors, including legal and fiscal advisors. Furthermore, i n view of the completion of the asset transfer and fully operationalising the new ICH Association, both the ICH Management Committee and MedDRA Management Committee approved an additional signatory from the ICH Secretariat, Ms. Emilie Macara, to provide representation vis -\u00e0-vis third parties on ICH and MedDRA related matters. It was agreed that Ms. Emilie Macara, along with existing Dr. Dawn Ronan (ICH Secretariat) have joint (by two) signatory rights to represent the ICH Association as authorized persons. Changes to the signatory rules in the ICH Employee Handbook were also made. Considerable work has been undertaken in order to prepare for the asset transfer which was finally completed in November 2017 thus rendering the ICH Association fully independent. The following represents a list of ke y activities undertaken in 2017 in support of work to complete this asset transfer and make the ICH Association full y operational : Liaison with the Geneva tax authorities in follow -up of ICH's request for a tax exemption (granted in October 2017) and submi ssion of the ICH Association's first tax return to the Swiss Federal Tax A dministration in September 2017.
