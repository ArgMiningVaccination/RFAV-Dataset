These concepts cannot be learned in the classroom.\" \"The arguing doctor simulation was so nerve wracking. It felt very real.\" \"I benefited from a diverse group of participants to enhance discussion.\" \"Great scenarios, realistic actors and portrayals of clinical situations in the field.\" RESULTS, COMMENTS, HIGHLIGHTS DISCUSSION DEBRIEFINGS After each simulation, an expert faculty facilitator leads a discussion: Opens discussion with participants' observations about the optimal courses of action under the circumstances Asks a series of standardized questions that address key ethical issues and concepts Develops strategies when confronted with the dilemma, including whom to consult A discussion of participants' emotional state and preparedness to deal with such dilemmas METHODS Interest in Global Health among health professions students has skyrocketed in the past decade, commensurate with an exponential increase in opportunities for \"field\" work. However, very few programs have robust pre-departure programs to prepare students for the unique ethical challenges of working in resource-limited settings. We designed and piloted a novel ethics training tool for students, residents and fellows in the health professions, using simulations with trained actors and real life scenarios. Preliminary results show that our global health ethics simulation tool accomplished its main objectives: to expose the trainees to various ethical dilemmas and have them reflect on alternative courses of action. Next steps will include evaluating impact of the tool once trainees return from their rotations. We have piloted a simulation-based training with trainees from medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and dentistry. Program evaluations assessed the impact of the training on participants`: 1.exposure to common ethical issues in global health 2.ability to strategize and deal with ethical dilemmas 3.ability to identify someone to turn to for guidance. The results showed a significant increase in all areas. FOUR SCENARIOS Trainees have to decide on their course of action when faced with: A patient who urgently needed a procedure outside of the trainee's scope of practice An HIV positive pregnant woman who feared being ostracized and harmed if she started treatment A hospital pharmacist who secretly diverted medications to poor patients without charging standard fees A pregnant minor who will die without a C-section, but is not allowed to go to the hospital because of gender norms SAMPLE SIMULATION VIDEO Pre and Post Simulation Results (N = 27) Conducted an extensive literature review Reviewed available ethics curricula (including online modules) Conducted 3 Focus Groups (n = 16 participants) of faculty representing Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Nursing Focus Groups informed the development of 8 simulation scenarios using real life experiences of the faculty ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the UCSF Academy of Medical Educators Innovations Funding grant and the UCSF Interprofessional Education grant for their generous support of this pilot program.
