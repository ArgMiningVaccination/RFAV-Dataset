Those who are eligible will be able to avail of booster doses through participating GPs and Pharmacies, and in Covid Vaccination Centres. As in previous campaigns, those living in long term care facilities will be vaccinated by HSE mobile teams, and those aged under 12 years will be vaccinated through Covid Vaccination Centres only. HSE mobile vaccinations teams will also administer COVID -19 vaccines to persons who are housebound, on referral from their GP. COVID -19 booster vaccines for those in the above e ligible groups may be given irrespective of the number of previous booster doses received. You will note from the NIAC advice that there have been some key changes to recommended interval periods. It is preferable that the NIAC recommended intervals are us ed, but if necessary, for operational reasons, in the Spring Booster campaign, those in the eligible cohorts listed above can receive their next booster if at least 3 months have elapsed following any previous COVID -19 vaccine dose or infection. The Natio nal Immunisation Office are currently working to update the clinical guidance and this will be available shortly. Please refer to NIO bulletins and web content at: https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/hcpinfo/covid19vaccineinfo4hps/ or any clinical queries please contact immunisation@hse.ie . Community Pharmacies can commence administering Spring boosters as soon as the full clinical guidance has been published by NIAC and the NIO, and staff have completed all the relevant training modules. We will notify you as soon as this material is ready and available. Office of National Director Clinical Programme Implementation & Professional Development HSE, Dr Steevens recommended that, as far as possible, those eligi ble for a Spring booster should receive it before the end of May. This will then allow for a sufficient interval period to elapse, to enable those vaccinated to receive another booster dose with their flu vaccine in the autumn. HSeLanD Vaccination Trainin g Programmes Covid -19 training - Please ensure all staff involved in the COVID -19 vaccine programme have received appropriate training and are up to date with the current recommendations. Training programmes are available by logging into your account on www.hseland.ie . Vaccinators should complete the relevant modules on HSeLanD prior to the campaign commencing. Training modules are currently being updated to reflect the new guidance and will be available shortly.
