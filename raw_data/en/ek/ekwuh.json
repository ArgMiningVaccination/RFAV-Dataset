Several senators predicted that Susan Collins of Maine would be the fifth, although her office declined comment. Inside the chamber, where Chief Justice William Rehnquist presided, the talk was blunt at times. \"Over and over and over again, from both sides of the aisle,\" senators denounced the president as a liar, GOP Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah said later. Bennett predicted that Clinton would go down in history as \"the mollt accomplished polished liar we've ever had in the White House.\" The very name \"Clinton,\" he forecast, will become part of the lexicon as \"8 syn\u00ad onym for an elegant, weU-craft.ed lie.\" A two-thirds vote is required to con\u00ad vict the president and remove him from office, and there is no chance of that happ~ning. Instead, whatever suspense lingered at the end of the five-week trial was whether either article of impeachment would attain a bare majority -a psychological threshold that bad no bearing on Clinton's fate. Republicans have a 55-45 majority in the Senate.

Associated Press HANOVER, N.H. -Dartmouth - College students are so furtous at the school's push to get rid of traditional fraternities and sororities that they canceled the keg jump and 20 other events at this weekend's Winter Carnival to show how boring life on campus can be. An estimated 1,000 students protested Wednesday night outside Dartmouth President James Wright's home, which happens to be on frater\u00ad nity row. He did not come outside, but he did open th~ carnival on the college green Thursday night. About 900 students were there, many wearing sw11atshtrts displaying Greek letters. Non-members wore T\u00b7 shirts declaring, \"Unaffiliated but I support the Greeks.\" Standing in front of a 20-foot snow sculpture of a dog, Wright joked: \"I have not been invited to any fraterni\u00ad ty parties this weekend, but I still intend to have a good time.\" Most of the crowd booed. Student& were stunned by the school's plan, made public Tuesday, to do away with single-sex, residential fraternities and sororities to encour\u00b7 age \"respectful relations between women and men.\" Officials at the Ivy League school, which inspired the movie \"Animal HoW!e,\" refused to say whether the plan means requiring fraternities and sororities to go coed or phasing them out altogether .

By c.rte Johnston The Daily Iowan \u00b7 The VI College of Liberal Arts unveiled a new logo Thursday in front of a crowd of 25 administra\u00ad tors, faculty and students. The winning logo, submitted by UI junior Kevin Oestenstad, com\u00ad bines the letters L and A, while simultaneously forming the image 'of a bridge in vivid green. , \"We hope that the logo will help students, faculty and staff to have a sense of identity,\" said Linda \u00b7Maxson, dean of the College of Liberal Arts. \"The bridge links the past and the future, and the green symbolizes renewal and growth - looking into the future.\" The logo was chosen from more than 30 entries. Jan Gratama, chairman of the logo committee '8Dd UI associate professor of art and art history, said that Oestenstad 's logo was the most 'liistinct of all the designs. 'The great thing about this logo is that the viewer has to really look at it \u00b7-first you see the 'L' and 'A,' then about five seconds later, the bridge,\" he said. 'That is one of the hallmarks Jor a good logo. It has retention.\" The new logo will appear on let\u00ad ' terheads, pens, T-shirts and coffee cups, along with many other items in the future, said Maxson. Oestenstad, a graphic design major, received a check for $1,000 from an anonymous donor who helped make the contest possible. Money, however, was not his motivation. \"I didn't go into this with the idea that I'm going to design a logo and win this contest,\" he said. \"I decided to take a stab at it, so I wouldn't regret not trying, especially if they chose a logo I didn't like.\" Working a few hours each night, the image of a bridge came into play, and that was incorporated into the letters L and A to symbol\u00ad ize and represent the entire uni\u00ad versity, he said. As for the prize money, Oestenstad said he has a few ideas about where it might disappear. \"There are some folks at Visa who would definitely like to see some of it,\" he said. \"What I really want to do is get a print of the logo, along with my award letter and artist statement, frame and matte that, and give it to my father.\" Oestenstad has also designed a brochure for the Iowa Children's Museum that is currently under con\u00ad struction in the Coral Ridge Mall. 01 reporter Carrie Johnston can be reached at: carolyn-iohnston@uiowa.edu LEGAL MAlTERS Christopher R.

Accidents are things that no one could prevent.\" said Timothy Peterson, formerly of Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines. Peterson said that public health officials should work to prevent so-called car surf\u00ad ing, just as they work to prevent diseases. Peterson and former colleagues from the center published one of the lew studies looking at injuries suffered by people who fall by riding on the hoods or roofs of moving vehicles. Peterson recently became medical director of the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services at the Iowa Department of Public Health. The study, published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, looked at five people treated at the center for car-surfing injuries in 1996 and 1997. Three at them died. Car-surfing injuries are relatively rare, but Peterson thinks some victims might lie about the circumstances and some are lucky enough to suffer only minor injuries. He also said victims onen donl want to admit they were doing something that was foolish. In the five cases studied by Peterson and his colleagues, the cars were traveling as last as 65 mph. But two of the people who died were traveling just 20 mph. DUBUQUE (AP) -A Dubuque social worker laces disciplinary charges of unethical conduct on allegations ll! encouraged clients to shoplift for him. On Feb. 22, Charles Koranda will have a hearing with the Iowa Board of Social Work Examiners. In October, Koranda and his wife, fellow social worker Marjorie Koranda, were acquitted on third-degree theft charges. Police charged that Charles Koranda, while working tor the social service agency, Alternative Services. encouraged a 14-year-old and his 16-year-old sister to steal items ranging from cigarettes to a laptop computer. Court documents say Koranda told police he knew the items were stolen and he and his wife purchased the merchandise tram the children to help them out. The social work board charged him with engaging in unethical conduct, exercising undue influence on a patient or client, and with practicing outside the scope ot his license. Profs try to make pre .. med requisites easier Of the two survivors in the study, one was hospitalized for 11 days and had 27 days ot rehabilitation. He still suffers some mental impairmeflt, Peterson said. The other was hospitalized for three days and then released. Officials from the board also said Koranda encouraged two minor patients to shoplift various items in 1997 and 1998. Koranda then bought the items from the youths and their mother and knew they were stolen, the board charged. A woman who answered the phone i Alternative Services said Koranda has net worked lor the agency tor about two nmths. The chemistry and biology departments are taking steps to make their infamous \"weed out\" courses more accessible. By leah Reinstein The Daily Iowan As a visiting professor at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minn., last September , Ul chemistry Professor Daniel Quinn found out the extensive rumors cir\u00ad culating about pre-med students and the chemistry department at the Ul. \"One student originally from Iowa heard that Principles of Chemistry I and Principles of Chemistry II (4:13 and 4:14) were generally known as the 'weed\u00ad out' classes for freshman chem\u00ad istry majors and pre-meds,\" he said. \"'twas then that I realized some things had to change.\" \"Weed-out\" courses are not the only myths being spread about the UI chemistry and biology departments. Some students believe that professors have been placed on scholastic probation for handing out too many failing rrades. Joseph Frankel , UI biology profeseor, said he this \u00ad tion. \"'ftr the years that I haft been teaching at the UI, I han repeatedly been told that stu\u00ad dents -or at least some students ,, ______ _ The early required classes are not meant to be 'weed,out' classes, and our professors don't expect much more than any other professors do. -Daniel Quinn, Ul chemistry professor ______ ,, -believe that I am 'on probation ' for giving too many 'F's in my Principles of Biology course,\" he said. Quinn and Frankel said they decided to take steps in the past year to dispel these myths by attempting to make the introducto\u00ad ry classes in both departments less of a nightmare for new biology and chemistry majors. \"The early required classes are not meant to be 'weed-out' classes,\" Quinn said, \"and our professors don't expect much more than any other professors do.\" One step the departments have taken is to cut class sizes. This is a way to make the transition easier for incoming freshmen . Chemistry I and Chemistry II are two classes affected by this change. They were originally large lecture classes for all stu\u00ad dents but are now divided into one class for majors and one for non\u00ad majors. The grading policies have been changed, too. The former 2.3 sug\u00ad gested GPA for all grades given in an individual course has been raised to 2.4. This bas resulted in only 1-2 percent of students failing courses as opposed to last year's 10 percent. According to Scarlett Canady, a UI junior and pre-med major, the low distribution of grades may not have been due to the professors, but more to apathy on the part of students. \"Freshmen come into these classes thinking they want to be pre-med without realizing how tough it may be,\" she swd. \"It seemed that professors wanted students to prove that they really wanted to be pre-med, and it really helped to go speak with them in person.\" But staying at the same pace as professors is sometimes a problem for pre-med students, said Ul junior Colleen Clarke .. \"I had a big problem with (chemistry) professors; they \u00b7 seemed to forget sometimes that we are at an introductory level,\" she said. \"It's hard for them to relate back to us.\" Though learning is collabora\u00ad tive between professors and stu\u00ad dents, it is students who are pri\u00ad marily responsible for their edu\u00ad cation, Frankel said. \"Students are adults in charge of their own education ,\" he said. \"It is up to them to decide whether they want to learn or not.

BJ Anne Gearan Associated Press WASHINGTON -Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Thursday the timing of news leaks about a Justice Department probe of pos\u00ad sible prosecutorial wrongdoing by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr smacks of partisanship. \"The articles appeared in the press while the Senate was con\u00ad ducting final deliberations on the articles of impeachment against President Clinton,\" Hatch wrote in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder. \"The timing of these \u00b7articles could not be more suspicious,\" Hatch wrote. He warned Holder to be ready to answer questions about the matter today at a previously scheduled meeting with Hatch. Meeting with reporters earli\u00ad er Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno would not comment directly on news reports that the Justice Department will investigate whether Starr over\u00ad stepped his bounds in the early days of the Monica Lewinsky investigation . Starr's Lewinsky investigation led eventually to Clinton's impeachment and Senate trial for alleged perjury and obstruction of justice. Hatch, a frequent critic of Reno's handling of independent counsel matters, said the leaks apparently came from the Justice Department . He ques\u00ad tioned whether prosecutors could conduct an impartial investigation of Starr. \"These press accounts once again call into question the department's integrity and support the impression many people have that this is a parti\u00ad san Justice Department ,\" Hatch wrote. Reno angered Hatch by refus\u00ad ing to seek independent counsels to investigate 1996 campaign fund-raising allegations related to Clinton, Vice President AI Gore and former White House aide Harold Ickes. In a television appearance Wednesday night, Hatch called Reno's department the most partisan Justice Department this century. \"We will provide whatever information is appropriate at the meeting\" with Hatch, Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said. Reno, asked about earlier criticism from Hatch, denied that she has taken sides as Starr pursued a variety of alle\u00ad gations against the Clinton White House. \"I have a great respect for Sen. Hatch,\" Reno said at her weekly press conference. \"And I think if he looked at the record, he would see that I've been damned by both sides and will continue to try to call it like. I see it.\" Restriction of Open 3rd Party E-mail Relay ITS will disable unrestricted third-party e\u00ad mail relaying on its SMTP server, ns-mx.uiowa.edu, on Monday, February 15, 1999. See rlre rrs Help Desk web sire for local support infonnation referenced in rhis note: hltp:/lwww.uiowa.edu/-itshelpl See http://maps.vix.com/tsilar-what.html for a description of third-party e-mail relaying. Many people send e-mail from home by dialing into an Internet service , provider such as CampusCWIX, or Avalon, or Internet Navigator and configure their e-mail client (Eudora, Netscape, Outlook, etc.) to use the ITS SMTP server send outgoing e-mail. The name of this server is ns-mx.uiowa.edu. Until now, use of ns-mx for outgoing e-mail has been unrestricted . That will change on February 15, 1999.

Unethical individuals and commercia l entities are using an Internet tactic Jed \"spamming\" where unsolicited junk mail is sent to very large numbers of 1 addresses. These entities use the mail-forwarding capabilities of large like the University of Iowa's ns-m'l to hide behind the institution's identity. This huge dumping of unsolicited messages degrades performance levels and can result in denial of service to university customers. Internet-wide, the resulting degradation has caused JSPs and other Internet sites to blacklist e-mail from institutions that pennit third party e-mail relaying. The result of blacklisting is that individuals identified with blacklisted are unable to send e-mail to more and more domestic and international The restriction on third-party relay is becoming the de facto standard on the . Most universities are implementin g this policy. Solution A consortium of University of Iowa network and e-mail administrators have ved to prevent sue~ blacklisting action from being taken against the ty of Iowa by prohibiting e-mail forwarding from sources outside the niversity of Iowa domain who are sending to destinations outside the University. 1. If you dial into an Internet service provider to send e-mail and have your e\u00b7 client configured to ~end e-mail through ns-mx.uiowa.edu, you must reset your client's SMTP server to the server name provided by your Internet service provider.

By Terence Hunt Associated Press WASffiNGTON -Remorse or revenge? President Clinton must strike a delicate balance after his impeach\u00ad ment trial -trying to demon\u00ad strate contrition while waging a political war against the Republicans who sought to drive him from office. He wants to push his own agen\u00ad da through the Republican Congress and then help Democrats win back control of the House and Senate. But at the same time, he can't gloat or be smug about defeating Republican efforts to oust him. That would be unseemly for a man marked. in history as only the second American presi\u00ad dent to be impeached. \"We know Clinton,\" said Brookings Institution analyst Thomas Mann. \"He's perfectly capable of going to work with peo\u00ad ple who were and are his adver-saries. At the same time, he will fume pnvately and do what he can to defeat them. There's no overt public bitterness , there's no public, 'I'm going to get even.' There's no self pity\" Republican strategist Eddie Mahe, however, believes that Clinton's \"natural hubris, his arro\u00ad gance, will be the driving force in how he behaves in the coming days, weeks and months. He will believe and act accordingly, that whatever he presents to Congress , he is automatically entitled to get his way.\" Mahe said Republicans should go their own way, take a stand of \"substantial disengagement from the guy\" and tell Americans what the GOP believes in, without drawing a contrast with Clinton. \"A lot of us can't even mention his name without our venom showing.\" There was a swirl of talk Thursday about whether Clinton would seek post-impeachment revenge against Republicans, par\u00ad ticularly against the House man\u00ad agers who prosecuted the case. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said it was \"deeply troubling that the president views closure of this constitutional process as an oppor\u00ad tunity for revenge.\" But White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart pointed out that most of the 13 House man\u00ad agers are in politically safe dis\u00ad tricts and were handily re-elected in November . \"I can't think of a worse, more dumb strategy than going after people based on whether they were a House man-ager or not, he said.. After today's expected impeach\u00ad ment acquittal, Clinton intends to' try to clear the air with a sta~ ment urging the country to leave behind divisions about impeach\u00ad ment and move on to other mat\u00ad ters.

That could CQunt towards the officer's credibil\u00ad io/ in the current complaint, she said. But simply using a string of unfounded complaints as evidence of guilt in a current complaint can\u00ad not be done, she said.

Officers will be identified by the specific numbers on the next com\u00ad plaint sent to the board, police Chief R.J. Wmkelhake said. Councilor Mike O'Donnell said if he knew an officer had several prior complaints, he couldn't rule that out of his decision on the cur\u00ad rent complaint. Board members insisted they could decide on a complaint without using the offi\u00ad cer's complaint history improperly . \"'t seems to me there's a little piece of trust here that nobody is willing to lay on the table,\" board member Pat Farrant said. \"'We haven't behaved that way yet, and I don't see that happening .\" Councilor Dee Norton added that in complaints filed with the police Students upset over changes in Greek system DARTMOUTH Continued from Page lA to coincide with the carnival.

Hillary Miller, 18, a freshman from New York City, and Calmita Fields, 21, a senior from Drexel Hill, Pa., who don't belong to sororities, said they liked the administratio n's idea because there would be more social events without alcohol.

The council also agreed to extend deadlines from 60 to 90 days for completion of the police chiers report to the board and for citizens filing complaints with the board.

Dl reporter Crluy McMartin can be reached al: cristine\u00b7mcmartinOulowa .edu Jury finds gun makers liable in New York shootings A shooting survivor and his mother were awarded $500,000. By Tom Hays Associated Press NEW YORK -A federal jury Thursday found several gun mak\u00ad ers responsible in three area shoot\u00ad ings for letting guns fall into the hands of criminals . Other manu\u00ad fa.cturers were cleared. The only damages awarded were $~00,000 to the sole survivor of the shootings, who was seriously wounded, and his mother. Steven Fox, 19, and the relatives of six homicide victims sued the gun industry in federal court in 1995 for seven shootings. Fox was accidentally shot by a friend, who had bought the gun on the street. The bullet remains lodged in his head. The lawsuit sought unspecified damages from an industry that g4)lerates sales of $2 billion to $3 bi1lion a year. Like some of the lawsuits brought against Big tObacco, this one accused the gun industry of negligently marketing a legal prod\u00ad uct. The case also was closely watched by several cities trying to recover the costs of gun violence. \u00b7 The jury found 15 of the 25 gun makers that were sued- includ\u00ad ing Beretta USA Corp., Colt's Manufacturing Co., Glock, Inc. and Jennings Firearms, Inc. -distrib\u00ad ute their product negligently. Of those, the jury linked nine of the companies to one or more of the three shootings . Smith & Wesson Corp. and S~urm, Ruger and Co. were among those cleared. Afterward, both sides claimed victory. \"I thank God, we absolutely won,\" said lead plaintiff Freddie Hamilton, whose son, Njuzi, was slain in 1993. She predicted the verdict would bring a \"new phase\" of litigation against the firearms industry. Plaintiff attorney Elisa Barnes said: \"It was an incredible victory.

Industry lawyer James Dorr called the result \"a defense verdict in all respects,\" and John Renzulli, whose clients include Glock, Inc., said \"it completely makes no sense.\" During the monthlong trial, the plaintiffs argued that handgun makers oversupply gun-friendly markets, mainly in the South, aware that the excess guns flow into criminal hands via illegal mar\u00ad kets in New York and other states with stricter anti-gun laws. The plaintiffs' lawyers accused the defendants of dumping hand\u00ad guns onto the black market like \"toxic waste,\" making no effort to identify and discipline dishonest distributors. Lawyers for the defendants insisted their responsibility ends once they sell to licensed distribu\u00ad tors. They said the job of policing traffickers should be left to the Bureau of Alcohol, 'lbbacco and Firearms, which has never required gun makers to track their products to the street.

The case is simply wrong.\" The gun makers also asserted that in most of the shootings the plaintiffs never presented evidence conclusively linking the weapons used to harm their relatives to spe\u00ad cific defendants . The plaintiffs countered that the \"chain of title\" is irrelevant, instead accusing the entire industry of creating a wide\u00ad spread risk with negligent market\u00ad ing -a concept known as collec\u00ad tive liability. \"This huge pool (of handguns) is like toxic waste,\" the plaintiffs' attorney, Elisa Barnes, said in clos\u00ad ing arguments.

I Greek pollee looking Into reports of U.S. cult RAFINA, Greece .(AP) -Greek security officials are investigating reports that mem\u00ad bers of an American doomsday cult are liv\u00ad ing near a seaside town, pollee sources said Thursday. The investigation into the Concerned Christians is centered around Rafina, about 15 miles west of Athens. Greek media reported that followers may have rented an apartment and villas in the nearby hillside community of Neo Voutza. Authorities have ordered surveillance of the two sites and have worked with immigra\u00ad tion officials to try to determine it members of the Denver-based group could be in Greece, said the sovrces, who spoke on con\u00ad dllioh of anonymity. Attempts to reach anyone residing at the addresses were unsuccessful. lsraeliast month deported 14 members of the cult for allegedly plotting attacks at holy .. sites in Jerusalem in an attempt to hasten the return of Christ. AI the time, some merrtefs said other followers were living In Grep. Mark Roggeman. a Denver pollee 'btficer who tracks cults in his spare time, said last week as many as 20 Concerned Christians were in Greece. U.S. Embassy officials In ' Athens could not confirm the presence of the cult members in Greece. The cult members denied any wrongdo\u00b7 ing in Israel and no charges were filed. But Israeli officials are worried about possible attacks and disruptions from religious-ori\u00ad ented groups drawn to the Holy Land for the millennium. Greece could also attract groups antici\u00ad pating the end of the world.

The bathtub may not be a tradition\u00ad ' al prop -but the concert will be any\u00ad . thing but traditional, Semonis said. \"I'd have to say the whole con\u00ad ~ cept behind modern dance is the non-traditional,\" Semonis said.

I \"It's definitely a dance piece, because it has a strong emphasis on movement, but there will emphasis on acting and text as well,\" she said. Another piece, titled \"Haru No Yume,\" will incorporate an element of Japanese theater -invisible stage assistants called kurokko. The choreographer, UI graduate student Arleen Sugano, said the assistant will be a dancer dressed completely in black. \"He is the one who uses the props, which are butterflies, but because he's dressed completely in black, the audience shouldn't see him, just the butterflies. This way it'll look like (the other) dancer is playing with the butterflies,\" she said. The diversity of pieces will be what makes this concert different, Semonis said. \"It will incorporate elements of ballet, modem dance and theatri\u00ad cal elements; it'll be anywhere from completely hilarious to incredibly sad,\" she said. \"There's a little something for everyone.\" The diversity is not completely unusual, however. According to Adams, the reason the concert wilt' have so many different concepts and emotions is the emphasis on choreography in the Ul dance pro\u00ad gram. \"Choreography is a very impor\u00ad tant part of the student education in the program here.

By David Balder Associated Press LOS ANGELES -On an early winter's night, songwriter John ~ Hiatt hit the television jackpot. Joey and Dawson were discu$sing 1 their relationship again on \"Dawson's Creek,\" wrestling over whether Joey would spend a semes\u00ad ter in Franoe. A piano in the back\u00ad ground heralded Hiatt's 1987 ballad, 1 \"Have a Little Faith in Me.\" Less than an hour later on \"Party ofFive,\" Julia and Ned were at Ned's college dorm, trying to decide whether to break up. The music came in as an insistent plea: Hiatt's \"Have a Little Faith in Me.\" Watching with a sense of renewed appreciation for her father was Hiatt's 14-year-old daughter. ' \"My stock went up with her and ' her friends quite a bit,\" the song\u00ad writer said with a laugh. 1 It did with his record oompany, too. , The placement of songs in TV abows -particularly those popular vrith a l teen-aged audience -are becoming , a potent way to expose music and to juice sales. ' It has to be just the right song, 1 though. And just the right moment Matching the two is the job of people auch as John McCullough, 1 Hollywood's most respected music supervisor, who recommends songs ' to television producers to enhance Rob Brown/Associated Press Chad Todhunter and Lacey Chabert In the Fox sarles \"Party ot Five.\" The show Is among those that expose music to a new audience, especially teenagers. their scenes. Music hlil! long played a vital role in movies, ~ut less so in television oomedies and dramas. McCullough's work has heJped change the thinking of 'IV and music executives. His placement of an Enya ballad added the perfect touch to a moonlit scene in \"Northern Exposure.\" The BoDeans' \"Closer to Free\" became a hit song when McCullough suggest\u00ad edit as the theme for \"Party of Five.\" Edwin McCain's \"I'll Be\" headed to the 'Ibp 10 at\\er it was used during a key scene in Dawson and Joey's end\u00ad less soap opera.

Networks like to cre\u00ad ate their own background music because it's cheaper. Sometimes artists don't want their work on TV or don't like a particular program. TV shows also generally can't afford the typical rate to license songs, so McCullough has to show executives how a discount may pay off in the longrun. \"They've finally realized the value of20 million viewers,\" he said.

Speculation among my colleagues is rife that the Women's Studies faculty lack the \"cojones\" (in a metaphorical sense, of course) to take us on. Others suspect that disdain is instead the jnotivator. Still, being polite, we engineers will await their response before we speculate further. : Leaving aside such weighty matters, my thoughts have turned to teaching. This is perhaps not an unreasonable direction for them, given that professors are supposed to ao this from time to time. : One of the great benefits of teaching is how much you can learn as you teach. I have often felt I only really learn some\u00ad lhing when I teach it, and as I teach more, I become more convinced of this. Very often, of course, what you learn is that students can ask fiendishly difficult guestions that you frantically struggle to readers answer, before finally resorting to the infa\u00ad mous phrase, \"I'll get back to you on that.\" While such learning is important, it is the sort that I have in mind today. \u00b7 Engineering classes, especially at the freshman level, offer ideal opportunities for learning from students. Students expect in such classes to be bombarded with quizzes, fonnulae and equations, so if you ask them to discuss something in groups and give you feedback, they are so grateful that their compliance is a delight to behold! Using students in this way might be con-sidered unethical by some, but as long as both parties learn something I feel I'm on solid ground with this approach. And hey, they get better treatment than interns in Washington, D.C. Knowing this, I used my class a couple of weeks ago to explore changes in tech\u00ad nology. I began by introducing the stu\u00ad dents to an engineering tool that is now no longer in use. & I'm sure you guessed, this tool was a slide rule, and I was not surprised that the students did not recognize it and hadn't ever used one. Yet, 30 years ago, every student in engineering would have been more than comfortable with slide rules and log tables. Taking this as a starting point, I posed the following question to my students: \"What things that you use today will be as obsolete in 20 years' time as the slide rule is today?\" Discussion ensued, and among the items that the students expected to dis\u00ad appear were cash, paper and, somewhat to my surprise, classrooms. Hearing that my teaching location was going to disappear significantly before I got to retire (unless I win the Power Ball, that is) was rather a. that's beside the shock. What, I won- point.

Cancer treatment may be breakthrough , 1 Cancer Institute scientists l have finally duplicated a . strategy first reported in May. '----::--::---:--:---::------lyo.teiQ . ...., Associated Press BOSTON -Government scien\u00ad tists managed to duplicate a Harvard doctor's suc\u00ad cess with an experimental cancer treatment that wipes out tumors in mice, and they plan to begin human testing by the fall. The closely watched develop\u00b7 , menta involve a natural protein called endostatin. It and a sister protein called angiostatin both , work -at least in mice -by blocking tumors' ability to sprout new blood vessels. This makes cancer fall dormant or disappear altogether in lab ani\u00b7 1 mals. But no one knows if the same thing will happen in people. The two proteins have been the , subject of a roller coaster of specu\u00ad lation ever since an enthusiastic t front-page story in the New York I Times in May 1998 on Dr. Judah Folkman and his experiments. But doubts grew last fall when it was reported that scientists from the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Md., had not been able to reproduce Folkman 's results. This week, a cancer institute team said it had at last duplicated Folkman's work. The break\u00b7 through using endostatin came only when the institute's scientists conducted the experiments at Folkman's laboratory at Children's Hospital in Boston. On Thursday, another team of cancer institute researchers said it has begun designing endostatin studies in humans. The institute wants to test the drug for safety in perhaps 10 to 30 patients with tumors of the breast, kidney, skin or other parts of the body. \"We are excited about this,\" said Dr. James Pluda, a cancer institute senior drug investigator. \"If all goes well, we hope to begin by the third quarter of this year -earli\u00b7 er, if possible.\" Pluda said it will take approxi\u00ad mately six months to design the study before it can be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for approval. Endostatin and angiostatin are being developed by EntreMed Inc., a small biotech company in Rockville, Md., whose stock price has risen and plunged with each bit of news about the drugs.

The warning from First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, first made In October, that Russia could lose Its nuclear \u00b7 capability, has produced rare unanimity among the country's bitterly divided political laclions.

HOYA VS. QUAR1lY Quartey finally gets his fight against De La Hoya By Ed Sell.,.. Jr. AssOCiated Press LAS VEGAS -Oscar De La Hoya also has clout outside the ring. His status as a gate attraction ia such that he can withstand outside pressures that often force other boxers to fight even with injuries . On Nov. 3, De La Hoya's fight against Ike Quartey of Ghana was postponed because of a cut over his left eye, so slight that some critics doubted it even existed. Quartey said be had heard De La Hoya was not in top shape and had been knocked down in sparring. \"It was not a serious cut,\" admitted De La Hoya, who will defend the WBC title against Quartey in a battle of unbeaten welterweights Saturday night at the Thomas and Mack Center. \"It was a slight cut across (above) the eye, but I didn't want to take a chance with a fight of this magnitude.\" The 26-year-old De La Hoya knows Quartey should provide the toughest test of his career. He aleo is well aware of his status as box\u00ad ing's biggest attraction outside the heavyweight division, and bow losses and sub-par performances would affect that s~tus . Of his last seven fights, five have been on pay\u00b7pjr\u00b7vi,ew, and those matches bav,~sed over $105 million in ~y-~r-view revenue. His\u00b7victory over Pernell Whitaker in 1997 drew 800,000 buys and grossed $35 million, '' It was a slight cut across (abooe) the eye, but I didn't want to cake a chance with a fight of this magnitude. -Oac1r De L1 Hoy1, on why he pulled out of last November's fight ______ ,, the highest non-heavyweight pay-per-view gross and buy rate. Saturday's fight also is being carried on pay-per-view by TVKO. De La Hoya is guaran\u00ad teed $9 million, while Quartey is getting about $3 million. One reason for De La Hoya's drawing power is his attractive\u00ad ness to women. Mark Taffet of TVKO said Thursday : \"We periodically do research on who's watching, and increasingly more women are present in households that order and watch Oscar De La Hoya's fights.\" De La Hoya, boxing's Golden Boy ever since he won a gold medal in the 1992 Olympics, also is a commercial success. His endorsements include McDonald's, Levis, Calvin Klein, Florsbeim shoes and the Milk Council. No wonder his philosophy is, \"If you're not 100 percent inside the ring, don't fight because you're risking everything .\" His boxing career is now being run as a joint venture between Bob Arum's 'Ibp Rank and Oscar De La Hoya Enterprises . De La Hoya bas called off fights on four previous occa\u00ad sions. Wdh Okey gone, Iowa's other big men must step up ..

It's really tragic.\" With Okey gone and Settles questionable, Iowa's frontcourt suddenly is an area of concern. A few weeks ago, the team appeared to have one of the strongest front lines in the conference. \"'t seems like it's slipping away,\" forward Jacob Jaacks said. It's now up to Jaacks, J.R. Koch and Guy Rucker to fill in the holes that have formed around the bas\u00ad ket. Any minutes Settles could con\u00ad tribute would be beneficial. \"(In order for me to play), it can't get any worse than it is now,\" Settles said Thursday. \"'t doesn't look good right now, but I'm gonna try.\" Davis said be hopes Settles can practice today, and labeled the player's status as \"day-to-day.\" Settles was granted a sixth year of eligibility by the NCAA prior to Iowa's season opener in November. The injuries are just the latest in a series of difficulties faced by the Hawkeyes this season. -Guard Kyle Galloway has missed most of the season with back problems . -The team bas had to deal with adverse media publicity concern\u00ad ing the UI's decision not to extend Davis' contract. -The father of guard Dean Oliver was sentenced to prison for drug charges. -.Rucker missed a game after the death of a family member. Moreover, the team has lost five of its last eight games, despite defeat\u00ad ing Minnesota on Wednesday. \"We're just like, 'What else could go wrong this year? What's gonna happen next?\"' Luehrsmann said.

Coach Paul Wardlaw is expect\u00ad ing this weekend to pose very sim\u00ad ilar -if not more challenging - competition to what the Hawkeyes faced last year. \"Illinois has a new coach (Sujay Lama) who used to be the assis\u00ad tant coach at Florida,\" Wardlaw said. \"Florida has won the last cou\u00ad ple national titles, so Illinois will have lofty goals and are much improved . \"Northwestern is the most tal\u00ad ented team in the Big Ten and is the preseason favorite to win the Big Ten title. It will be tough.\" Northwestern started the spring season ranked 32nd in the nation. The team also returns the 1998 Big Ten player of the year, Katherine Nasser. But Dawaf is expecting tough competition from the lllini, as well. \"They both have strong lineups and all of their players are tough,\" she said. \"Their lineups do not have any holes. In preparation for this week\u00ad end's meets, the Hawkeyes haven't focused on a particular area to improve upon. However, they are aiming to start their matches off stronger and take control early on. \"These are two very tough teams,\" Dawafsaid . \"We need to go out strong and get the first critical games, which will give us an idea of where we are.\" 01 sportswrite r U11 CtiDMI can be ruched at lcolonnoOblue .weeo.lowa.edu. _,errig to be honored Sunday before, after game j WOMEN'S HOOPS Continued from Page lB think we've got the game in band.\" The game will feature two teams on opposite ends of the spectrum with regard to putting the ball in the basket.

Herrig said she isn't looking for\u00ad ward to the pressure of performing in front of about 35 friends and family members making the trip to Iowa City from around the country. That doesn't include the large Dubuque County contingent that will make the 90-minute trip.

By Mike Harris Associated Press DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -It took Dale Earnhardt 20 years to win his first Daytona 500, but he sees no reason he can't do it again. After all, John Elway won two straight Super Bowls. \"I plan on winning that race,\" Earnhardt said Thursday after his dominating victory in one of two 125-mile qualifying races at Daytona International Speedway. The win confirmed his status as one of the favorites Sunday, if not the guy to beat in the 41st running of NASCAR's richest and most prestigious event. Earnhardt considered Elway's long-awaited Super Bowl success in 1998 an omen for his victory last February. The fact that the Denver Broncos' quarterback did it again this year has only given Earnhardt more confidence. \"Elway won again. I won another qualifying race and we're headmg toward Sunday,\" Earnhardt said. \"It feels a lot better than if he'd lost.\" The\u00b7 victory Thursday gave Earnhardt a sweep of his 10 quali1Y\u00ad ing races in the '90s and a total of 12 Ul ROAD SPORtS ROUNDUP Men's swimming This weekend: The Iowa SWim\u00ad ming learn heads lo Lawrence, KS !his week\u00ad end for a dual meet against lhe Jayhawks The meet begins at 2 p.m. Saturday and is the las! dual of lhe season tor both teams.
