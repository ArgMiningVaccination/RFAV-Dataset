It's done. Can we stop talking about it now?](#DaVinciCodemoney) Thankfully, Da Vinci Code stories are down to a trickle. Some of the remaining stories are worth reading if only because they're ridiculous. For example, check out the Associated Press dispatch, \" 'Da Vinci' Theater Projector Lenses Stolen\": GRAND FORKS, N.D. - A movie theater was forced to close on the opening night of The Da Vinci Code after 20 projector lenses were stolen, but the manager said he did not think the theft was related to protests of the film. A sign on the door of the Carmike 10 Theaters Friday night told moviegoers that The Da Vinci Code would be shown at another Carmike-owned theater in the city. Showings of nine other movies were canceled. Some Christian groups have decried The Da Vinci Code based on Dan Brown's best selling novel as sacrilegious, and Christian leaders in China, Singapore, India, South Korea, Thailand and elsewhere have tried to get the film censored or banned. Protesters some holding signs that said \"Boycott Hollywood\" and \"Pray for Dan Brown\" said the theft was not connected to their demonstration. Manager Richard Melby also said he did not think the protest and theft were related. \"It's their right to do what they're doing, and I don't have a problem with it,\" he said. Investigators made no immediate connection between the theft and the movie. One supposes the article could just as easily have been written thus: GRAND FORKS, N.D. - A movie theater was forced to close on the opening night of Over the Hedge after 20 projector lenses were stolen, but the manager said he did not think the theft was perpetrated by Dan Brown fans or anti-Christian fanatics attempting to thwart a proposed \"other-cott\" in the American heartland. Police made no immediate connection between the theft and the animated film. 2. [Iran isn't Nazi Germany after all](#NodresscodeforIran) You might hear [reports](http://www.theindiancatholic.com/news_read.asp?nid=1772), based on a [now-removed](http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=11fbf4a8-282a-4d18-954f-546709b1240f)National Post article last Thursday, that Iran passed a law requiring Christians, Jews, and other minorities to wear colored badges identifying them as non-Muslims. The article incited the prime ministers of Canada and Australia, along with numerous others, to condemn the law. But it turns out the law [doesn't exist](http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=6626a0fa-99de-4f1e-aebe-bb91af82abb3). False alarm. 3. [Israel considers anti-conversion law](#Israel) It has worked so well in a few Indian states, several Muslim nations, and other repressive societies that some Israelis think that anti-evangelism laws are just what the country needs. \"MK Haim Oron (Meretz) was set to propose a bill against those who pressured minors to adopt an orthodox or secular lifestyle. According to the proposal, such actions would be punishable by imprisonment,\" the Jerusalem Post reported. Doesn't look like the bill is going anywhere, thankfully, so don't freak out yet. 4. [Judge says no prayer at graduation; students pray anyway](#Graduationprayer) On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Joseph H. McKinley specifically ordered the Russell County [Ky.] High School not to include a prayer in the graduating ceremony. So during the principal's opening remarks, about 200 students stood and recited the Lord's Prayer. \"Thunderous applause drowned out the last part of the prayer,\" the Courier-Journal reports. Huh, all those letter-writers touting the \"rule of law\" on immigration don't seem to be as agitated about this. It must be one of those better-to- [obey-God](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:5-15;&version=47;)-than-man things. 5. [Dover case judge: When religion was science](#Evolution) U.S. District Judge John E. Jones, recently named one of [Time](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1187265,00.html) magazine's most influential people in the world because he \"ruled for Darwin\" in the Dover, Pennsylvania, school board case, spoke about religion at Dickinson College, his alma mater, over the weekend. \"The founders believed that true religion was not something handed down by a church or contained in a Bible, but was to be found through free, rational inquiry,\" he told the class of 500. In other words, he said the founders believed that science was the highest form of religion. \"They possessed a great confidence in an individual's ability to understand the world and its most fundamental laws through the exercise of his or her reason. This core set of beliefs led the founders, who constantly engaged and questioned things, to secure their idea of religious freedom by barring any alliance between church and state.\" Ah yes, the founders and their barring of any alliance between church and state. Jones read a bit of Jefferson and claimed his views represented \"the founders.\" His alma mater's namesake, John Dickinson, might have disagreed, especially on his view of \"true religion.\"\u00c2 \"Not the least intimation in history or tradition that religion was discovered by reason. But the contrarythat is by revelation,\" he wrote. \"The great question as to reason is thiswhether reason since the introduction of sin into the world is sufficient to discover our duty and incline us to enforce its performance. Denied.\" He had some nice things to say about the Bible, too, but we'll let you grab James Hutson's The Founders on Religion (where we grabbed the above quote) to see for yourself. [Quote of the day](#JaroslavPelikan) \"The only alternative to tradition is bad tradition.\" Jaroslav Pelikan in a 2003 interview with Speaking of Faith's Krista Tippett, rebroadcast this month after Pelikan's death.
