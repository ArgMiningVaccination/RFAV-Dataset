The fewest number of wild poliovirus (WPV) cases have been recorded to date in 2017, and only three countries are defined as \"endemic\" where the virus may continue to circulate in these populations. Country Ministries of Health (MoH) and government leadership are critical to interruption of WPV, the goal of eradication. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), founded in 1988, coordinates global, regional, and country efforts through technical assitance, resource mobilization, vaccine procurement, and other key activities to achieve polio eradicaiton. The partnership is made up of the World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary International, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Unicef, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The GPEI will accomplish their goal when the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (GCC) certifies all WPV types (1, 2 and 3) have been eradicated. The 2013-2018 Polio Eradication & Endgame Strategic Plan (PEESP) defines the objectives and activities required to achieve eradication and, as eradication nears, the GPEI has begun planning a strategy on what will be needed to sustain this progress on a global scale. The development process engaged a broad set of stakeholders from polio, immunization, donors, partners, regional colleagues, and other health initiatives to gather input and document the functions needed to sustain a polio-free world. Planning for a Polio-Free World In 1995, the World Health Assembly (WHA) charged the GCC with the following tasks: (1) defining the parameters and processes by which polio eradication will be certified, guiding regions and countries in establishing their data collection processes; (2) receiving and reviewing the final reports of Regional Certification Commissions (RCCs) of polio eradication; and (3) issuing, if and when appropriate, a final report to the Director-General of WHO certifying that global polio eradication had been achieved. As stated in a January 2004 WHO bulletin, the main criteria set by the GCC as prerequisites for global polio-free certification were to show the absence of WPV, isolated from cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) (suspect polio), healthy individuals, or environmental samples, in all WHO regions for a period of at least three years in the presence of high-quality, certification-standard surveillance.1 A process will be undertaken with the GCC, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) and the International Health Regulations (IHR) to determine the criteria and method to validate the absence of vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) after global withdrawal of the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV). As the GPEI partnership works towards eradication, it has also started a process to define the technical standards and guidance for the functions required to sustain a polio-free world\u2014the core of which is found in this Post-Certification Strategy (PCS). The threats of re-emergence of 1 For the definition of eradication as the interruption of WPV transmission, see WHO. Smith J, Leke R, Adams A, and Tangermann RH. Certification of polio eradication: process and lessons learned. Bulletin of the World Health Organization. January 2004;82:24-30. Executive Summary POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 2 the virus after global certification considered in this strategy fall into three categories: (1) continued use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), (2) unsafe handling of any poliovirus, and (3) undetected transmission. The PCS outlines how to address, reduce, and (where possible) eliminate these risks. Anticipating the transfer of skills, knowledge, and resources of a programme that is over 30 years old, it will be important to start now to plan the implementation of this strategy since the GPEI partnership will dissolve at certification. The GPEI and future owners will begin implementation planning to ensure the success of the strategy and to safeguard this extraordinary achievement after the review of the Polio Oversight Board (POB). This strategy is intended to provide the future guardians of a polio-free world with a starting point by documenting the functions and activities required to sustain eradication until future risks are deemed no longer relevant. The future owners will come from Ministries of Health, advisory groups, global partners, and donors. Over the course of the polio eradication effort, the resources supporting polio activities at the global, regional, and country level also supported broader health initiatives such as measles campaigns, surveillance for yellow fever, delivery of anti-malarial bednets and Vitamin A supplements, outbreak response (e.g., Ebola), and humanitarian aid.2 At a minimum, 50 percent of total polio staff time is spent supporting activities related to broader immunization and healthcare goals.3 Current polio resources, funding, and systems will need to be transitioned to either (1) groups that will support maintaining a polio-free world or (2) groups that have relied on polio resources to accomplish their health goals. The PCS: A Risk Mitigation Strategy The focus of this document is to identify the set of activities critical to maintaining a polio-free world. The risks to this achievement are higher in some of the world's poorest countries if the transition is not well planned and effectively implemented. Managing these risks will require leadership from groups outside of the GPEI partnership. The following three goals have been identified to mitigate the current and future risks to maintain a polio-free world. 1. Contain polioviruses . The objective of goal one is to achieve and sustain containment of polioviruses in laboratories, vaccine manufacturers, and other facilities (e.g., academic institutions). The key areas of focus will be to reduce the number of facilities storing poliovirus globally and to implement and monitor long-term poliovirus containment in facilities with appropriate safeguards. 2. Protect populations . The second goal is to protect populations both (1) in the immediate- term from vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and VDPVs by preparing and coordinating the global withdrawal of bOPV, and (2) in the long term from any poliovirus re-emergence by providing access to safe, effective vaccines. 3. Detect and respond to a polio event . The focus of the third goal is to promptly detect any poliovirus in a human or in the environment through a sensitive surveillance system 2 GPEI, WHO.

POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 3 and maintain adequate capacity and resources to effectively contain or respond to a polio event. As per the decision taken by the GPEI Polio Oversight Board (POB) in October 2017,4 the GPEI partnership will focus on defining the technical functions required after certification and support the post-GPEI programmes with implementation planning. (See Figure 1 ) Figure 1: Timeline for certification, bOPV cessation, and the post-cessation period The implementation of this strategy and the operationalization of pledged funding after certification will be the responsibility of the future owners of the functions laid out in this document. The transition or hand-off of the PCS functions described in the three goals, as well as governance, management, and reporting activities, must begin well before the dissolution of the GPEI partnership.5 It is critical to identify the future owners of these functions and activities as soon as possible so both knowledge transfer and an assessment can be made regarding the capacity, capability, and change effort required for the future owners to be successful. Implementation planning of the PCS requires (1) the planning efforts of country Ministries of Health and Finance who will need to absorb or continue to support these three goals; (2) the internal planning efforts of the organizations that will continue to support these functions and activities (GPEI and non-GPEI organizations); and (3) planning by new partners and health initiatives beyond the GPEI for how they will begin to support activities in the post-certification 4 Footnote to be added once October POB minutes are posted to GPEI website. 5 See the POB Minutes, 22 April 2017. http://polioeradication.org/wp- content/uploads/2017/06/POB_Minutes_Mtg20170422.pdf POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 4 world. This document does not address governance, management, financial estimates, or monitoring elements, which will be critical to implementation, as these are considerations that should be defined by the future owners of this strategy. The financial resources required for these critical polio functions will depend on how the future owners will determine the organization and management of the PCS goals. The GPEI will provide cost estimates for the activites from certification to bOPV withdrawal. National transition plans will also include costs as estimated for activities at country level. A separate financial model with high- level cost estimates for the longer term period after bOPV withdrawal\u2014which will need to make assumptions for additional information and key decisions that are not known today\u2014will also be developed. The cost estimates will require review and updates by the future owners of the PCS and are therefore not included in this document. Additionally, the GPEI partnership will develop an investment case for the funds required to ensure the successful global withdrawal of bOPV. On the Verge of Success The world will need to work together to protect the success of eradication by planning well in advance for the transition from the eradication effort of the PEESP to the sustained effort of the PCS. Key factors to effectively implementing this strategy to sustain a polio-free world will require even greater ownership and self-funding from country governments, continued donor support for fragile states, and a shift in technical assistance from polio-dedicated groups to broader immunization and health emergencies groups within partner organizations. POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 5 Introduction Purpose While global eradication of global wild poliovirus (WPV) merits recognition for the scale and scope of work required, the activities and functions esential for \"getting the job done\" must now be reimagined for the post-certification era to safeguard against the re-emergence of poliovirus.6 The Post-Certification Strategic Plan (PCS) provides recommendations for mainstreaming the functions required for maintaining a polio- free world after global WPV certification. It covers the period starting from certification and extending for ten years. The interruption of WPV worldwide will hold signficance for global public health, it will be important to situate the PCS within broader public health regulations and frameworks, specifically the International Health Regulations (IHR), the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), and the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP).7 The IHR provides the foundation that a health threat anywhere is a health threat everywhere. With globalization and the risk for the international spread of dangerous pathogens, the IHR puts forward global regulations that direct countries to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health events. In addition to this focus on protection, detection, and response, the IHR calls for multilateral, multi-sectoral, and international coordination to strengthen country, regional, and global capacity for public health concerns and health security risks. The GHSA, as an initiative for 6 While there is an epidemiological difference between \"emergence\" (in the case of a new VDPV), \"re-emergence\" (from previously identified cVDPVs), and \"re-introduction\" (of WPV, VDPV, or Sabin from release), for the purposes of the plan and a more general readership beyond the GPEI, re-emergence is used to signal the return of polioviruses, more generally speaking, into a polio-free world after certification. 7 WHO.

May 2012. http://www.who.int/immunization/global_vaccine_action_plan/ Introduction PCS Engagement & Audience The PCS was developed through an iterative consultative process with experts within and beyond the GPEI. This extensive engagement aimed to provide opportunities for stakeholders at the global, regional, and national level to provide input on the approach and elements of the strategy. The PCS is intended for use by GPEI technical advisory groups, private and public-sector partners, and the future managers of the PCS more broadly, including some current agencies and donors as well as those outside of the GPEI. The PCS also provides broad strategic recommendations to national level stakeholders, such as Expanded Programmes on Immunization (EPIs) and Ministries of Health (MoHs), which will be expected to sustain a polio-free world. See Annex A - PCS Engagement List POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 6 implementing the IHR, supports global health security through reviews aimed at identifying gaps and strengths in country capacity. GVAP offers a framework for global equity by focusing on risks that impede universal access, as it endeavors to strengthen routine immunization programmes to meet vaccination coverage targets, accelerate control of vaccine-preventable diseases, and introduce new and improved vaccines. For the successful implementation of the PCS, it will be important to integrate post-certification goals within the \"GVAP 2.0\" under development and revisions to the five-year GHSA roadmap. These regulations and frameworks are critical to the post-certification era as they provide the global mechanisms and structures to ensure a polio-free world. The PCS has drawn upon them in outlining the activities, initiatives, research, and developments that need to be in place by certification, when the PCS will begin. The PCS contributes to bridging from the eradication effort to a polio-free world, as well as from GPEI-ownership of polio functions to a future ownership that will include Ministries of Health, advisory groups, global partners, and donors. It is through their leadership that the world will come to protect the elimination of WPV\u2014an achievement that may invigorate interest and investment in global public health. Scope The PCS is one part of a broader transition planning effort that addresses the changes associated with global certification of WPV eradication and the closure of the GPEI.8 The PCS outlines functions required to sustain polio eradication. The GPEI has identified functions that must continue in the post-certification period to sustain eradication. They include: containment, immunization with appropriate polio vaccines, poliovirus surveillance, and outbreak response. Other activities that GPEI staff have performed to help strengthen and support broader health systems will be addressed through transition planning at the country and agency level. The PCS is a global strategic plan. The PCS presents strategies identified by experts on the activities, functions, and mechanisms required to maintain a polio-free world. Its focus is on global and regional requirements that country programmes can expect to address after the closure of the GPEI. Because not all countries share the same risks, the PCS does not provide detailed guidance for how these functions should be mainstreamed or financed within national health systems at the country level. 8 See GPEI. Transitioning Planning Framework. March 2017. GPEI Transition Planning Transition planning has three goals: Goal One : Maintain and mainstream polio- essential functions after eradication has been certified, to protect a polio-free world Goal Two : Where feasible, desirable and appropriate, transition the capacities, processes, and assets that the GPEI has created to support other health priorities Goal Three : Capture and disseminate the lessons of polio eradication The PCS supports Goal One of the transition planning by providing global standards and guidance for polio-specific needs. Transition planning is underway at the agency level for each of GPEI partners and at the country level\u2014with special focus on 16 priority countries which represent the largest footprint for GPEI support. POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 7 Overall, country transition plans should be aimed at mainstreaming and financing these functions through a progressively greater percentage of a country's health budget in national systems over time or through long-term capacity building. Implementation planning should begin as early as possible to allow for gradual, high-quality transitions. A critical goal of these plans should be to ensure that the national management of polio functions within integrated surveillance, immunization systems, and outbreak response systems is strong enough to adopt and implement the high-level guidance provided in the PCS. The GPEI recognizes that a number of countries\u2014particularly those with the lowest income level and fragile health systems or those undergoing sustained emergencies and conflict\u2014may not have the capacity to fully plan for the mainstreaming of polio functions in the absence of donor and partner agency support. For these countries, the GPEI has provided dedicated support to help build their transition plans. PCS recommendations are provided independent of future ownership. Once the future owners are identified, a coordinated effort to implement the strategy is critical. The planning process should start well before certification, and the transition of ownership responsibly shifted from the GPEI partnership to the future owners. The intent of the PCS is to provide the information needed for those future owners at the global, regional, and country levels to step forward and take ownership of the functions required to sustain WPV eradication and maintain a polio-free world. Assumptions To define the activities, operations, and structures needed in the post-certification period, the PCS is built upon certain assumptions. 1. Global eradication of all WPVs will be certified and all regions will have met the expected certification criteria for surveillance and immunity. 2. The likelihood of poliovirus re-emergence will decrease with time, but the severity of the consequences will increase with time. Type 2 re-emergences will also be less likely than for types 1 and 3 after global certification because WPV2 has been certified since September 2015 and OPV2 use will have stopped.9 For the purposes of future risk management, both WPVs and VDPVs present a risk for community transmission. 3. Under the IHR, detection of any poliovirus (WPV, VDPV, or Sabin more than 4 months after last use of mOPV or post-bOPV cessation) will be reported to WHO and will lead to the declaration of a national public health emergency and response. Depending on the risk of international spread, the detection could constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) requiring a prompt, globally coordinated response. 9 Chronic excretion of an iVDPV2 is possible (though a low risk) with countries that used mOPV2 <5 years prior to certification. POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 8 Risks Global consensus on precise strategies, activities, and policies is needed to anticipate and respond to the possible re-emergence of poliovirus in the post-certification era. The PCS focuses on three risk categories: continued OPV use, unsafe handling, and undetected transmission.10 Risk Category #1: Continued OPV use While OPV is an extremely safe and effective tool for producing mucosal and humoral immunity against the virus, continued OPV use creates a risk of re-emergence\u2014which will gradually decline with time after the last use of OPV (see below and Figure 2 ). VDPVs: In populations with low immunization coverage, Sabin viruses from OPV may both revert to a neurovirulent form capable of causing paralysis (vaccine-derived poliovirus, or VDPV) and then develop the capacity for sustained circulation (circulating VPDVs or cVDPVs). Additionally, immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) can result when individuals with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) exposed to OPV excrete the virus for prolonged periods. Lastly, isolated mutated vaccine viruses detected in humans or the environment with no evidence of circulation (ambiguous VDPVs or aVDPVs), may spontaneously die out or become cVDPVs. VAPP: After receiving OPV, an individual will usually shed Sabin vaccine viruses for a limited period of time. Very sporadically, the vaccine virus can cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) either in a vaccine recipient or a close unvaccinated or non-immune contact of the recipient. Risk Category #2: Unsafe handling of any polioviruses Unsafe handling of materials that contain poliovirus may result in unintentional or accidental release of the virus into the environment from a vaccine manufacturer or diagnostic laboratories working with poliovirus materials. There may also be facilities with forgotten stores of potentially infectious materials, such as unaccounted-for vaccine vials or test specimens that also may result in the release of polioviruses. The intentional release of poliovirus is also possible, though the epidemiological impact and associated response strategies are the same as with accidental release. The potential consequences of accidental or intentional releases will increase with time as population immunity declines after OPV withdrawal. Risk Category #3: Undetected transmission There also remains a risk of undetected transmission since poliovirus can circulate in communities at low levels without resulting in cases of paralysis. With sensitive global surveillance at the time of certification, there will be high confidence that WPV transmission will have been interrupted and there is no active cVDPV transmission. The risk of undetected or more likely delayed detection of a cVPDV transmission will be low but persists, depending on the time that has passed 10 Aylward RB, Cochi SL. Framework for evaluating the risks of paralytic poliomyelitis after global interruption of wild poliovirus transmission Bull World Health Organ 2004; 82(1): 40-6. POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 9 since cVDPV was last detected. Sustaining sensitive global surveillance for poliovirus will be required as long as there is any risk of re-emergence. Assessing Risk over Time The primary risk and source of re-emergence is expected to vary over time after bOPV cessation. While Figure 2 shows the intensity or likelihood of specific risks, some risks may be consistent over time even as their importance relative to other risks can vary. The consequences for each risk also may vary considerably depending on when and where the re-emergence occurs. An analysis of the projected magnitude and frequency of each risk is presented in each goal and in Annex B . Evolution of Risk across Post-Certification Stages Pre-cessation to immediate post-cessation period (risk categories #1 and #3) Although still projected to be relatively rare occurrences, VDPVs will be the primary risk of a poliovirus re-emergence in the pre-cessation (0-1 year post-certification) and immediate post- cessation periods (2-5 years post-certification) due to the prior use of OPV. While the precise risk of a VDPV (either aVDPV or cVDPV) being detected and resulting in further community transmission will depend on multiple local circumstances, the risk of a cVDPV emergence is highest in the period 12-18 months after bOPV withdrawal. This risk will steadily decline with time; yet the consequences and risk of wider transmission in areas of poor sanitation will steadily accelerate as population immunity declines due to waning mucosal immunity and the growing number of OPV-na \u00efve birth cohorts.11 Intermediate post-cessation period (risk categories #1 and #3) As the risk of cVDPV wanes, the primary risk for poliovirus re-emergence in the intermediate post-cessation period (i.e., 6-9 years post-certification) will come from an iVDPV spreading within a community. No poliomyelitis outbreaks to date have been attributed to iVDPV; nevertheless, this is a possibility that needs to be considered. While spread from PID patients is a rare occurrence, the potential risk for iVDPV transmission in a community will rise as population mucosal immunity declines post bOPV cessation. (The highest risk for this scenario is among under-immunized populations in a few middle-income countries with a history of OPV use and a relatively high prevalence of PID patients.) Longer term post-cessation period (risk categories #2 and #3) A release of any category of poliovirus (WPV, VDPV, or Sabin) is unlikely, but such events have occurred.12 This risk, along with an even less likely possibility of a bioterrorist release, is inherent at all times but is the primary risk in the longer term period when there are no longer 11 See Grassly NC.

MBM 2015; 15:389, doi: 10.1186/s12879-015-1112-8. 12 In April 2017, a Dutch vaccine manufacturer reported a containment breach in which two workers were exposed to WPV 2 after a spill at the plant, with one worker becoming infected. See 13th IHR Emergency Committee statement, 2 May 2017. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/13th-ihr-polio/en/. POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 10 risks from VDPV. The risk for a containment breach will persist as long as facilities are storing and handling polioviruses. Securing the world from the re-emergence of the virus is dependent on recognizing and addressing these risks. In general, a country's risk profile and most likely source of poliovirus re- emergence will be determined by its prior history of OPV use, cVDPV outbreaks, as well income level and immunization coverage. (See Annex C ) Identifying the known risks is a critical step to informing health policy and programme interventions to reduce their possibility and limit their consequences, if they do occur. Figure 2. Risk of poliovirus re-emergence over time Goals The mitigation strategies of the PCS address the recognized source of risk through three goals: 1. Contain polioviruses . The objective of goal one is to achieve and sustain containment of polioviruses in laboratories, vaccine manufacturers, and other facilities (e.g., academic institutions). The key areas of focus will be to reduce the number of facilities storing poliovirus globally and to implement and monitor long-term poliovirus containment in facilities with appropriate safeguards. 2. Protect populations . The second goal is to protect populations both (1) in the immediate- term from vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and VDPVs by preparing and coordinating the global withdrawal of bOPV, and (2) in the long term from any poliovirus re- emergence by providing access to safe, effective vaccines. 3. Detect and respond to a polio event . The focus of the third goal is to promptly detect any poliovirus in a human or in the environment through a sensitive surveillance system and maintain adequate capacity and resources to effectively contain or respond to a polio event. POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 11 Timeline The technical standards and recommendations included in the PCS are offered as the last strategic phase of the eradication effort. To provide visibility into the strategy for sustaining a polio-free world after global certification and to allow for the planning required, the PCS was initiated in advance of WPV eradication. Implementation of the high-level guidance contained in the PCS will not begin until global certification, with the exception of specific activities required earlier in preparation for bOPV withdrawal. However, the planning efforts for PCS implementation will need to begin as soon as possible. The PCS will start at certification, three years after the global interruption of WPV transmission,13 and extends for 10 years after certification. If WPV is interrupted in 2018, global certification will be declared in 2021\u2014and the PCS strategy will likewise begin in 2021 and continue until 2030. Depending on the epidemiology of poliovirus transmission after 2017, the GPEI, donors, and country governments will identify the need for adjustments to the strategy. The PCS will require updates as risks to organizational, environmental, and programmatic factors change over time. While the PCS anticipates revisions\u2014likely to include a year prior to certification, after bOPV cessation, and at the midterm of the PCS's ten-year duration\u2014it is the future owners of the PCS who will re-evaluate the plan, as and when appropriate. Next Steps This document is one step in a larger process toward identifying the owners of PCS activities and planning for the implementation of these activities after the dissolution of the GPEI. It is put forward as an invitation and call for leadership from groups within and beyond the GPEI partnership who are committed to preserving the gains of the polio eradication effort. By the end of 2017, the PCS will be finalized through consultation with stakeholders from polio, immunization, donors, partners, regional colleagues, and other health initiatives. The strategy then will go through a review process with the WHO Executive Board and the Polio Oversight Board (POB) in early 2018. After receiving approval by these oversight bodies, it will be presented at the World Health Assembly in May 2018. Financial modeling has been underway alongside the development of the PCS to prepare high- level financial estimates for both the period immediately after certification until bOPV cessation and the longer period after cessation. In 2018, these estimates will be used by the GPEI to produce an investment case for the funds required to ensure the successful global withdrawal of bOPV. Taken together with agency transition plans and country transition plans, these additional supports for the post-certification era will be shared as a process unfolds for the GPEI, Ministries of Health, advisory groups, global partners, and donors to plan, coordinate, share, and eventually mainstream or integrate the functions outlined in this document for sustaining a polio-free world. 13 For the definition of eradication as the interruption of WPV transmission, see WHO.

POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 12 Contain Polioviruses Main Objectives Major Activities Objective 1.1 - Activity 1.1.1 - Achieve and sustain containment of polioviruses in laboratories, vaccine manufacturing and other facilities Support reduction of the global number of facilities storing poliovirus Activity 1.1.2 - Implement and monitor long-term containment of poliovirus in facilities with appropriate safeguards Introduction After the global interruption of WPV transmission and cessation of bOPV use, certain laboratories and manufacturing facilities will need to continue handling polioviruses for vaccine production, quality control, diagnostics, and research. Accidental or intentional release of poliovirus from facilities may re-establish poliovirus circulation in the population. To minimize the risks posed by facilities handling poliovirus, containment was included as a goal for the endgame strategic plan. The global strategies and mechanisms to achieve effective poliovirus containment were outlined in the third edition of the Global Action Plan (GAPIII) to minimize poliovirus facility-associated risk, endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2015.14 Achieving containment of all poliovirus and monitoring compliance with containment requirements will be critical functions post-eradication. Description of the Goal Goal One aims to achieve and sustain effective poliovirus containment measures to mitigate the likelihood and consequences of re-introducing poliovirus from laboratories or vaccine manufacturing facilities into a polio-free world. The major principles of poliovirus containment are: 1) minimal number of facilities storing and handling poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials; 2) minimal risk of exposure for the worker or community as a result of operations; 3) minimal susceptibility of workers to poliovirus infection; and 4) minimal consequences of release in the community. 14 World Health Organization. GAPIII: WHO global action plan to minimize poliovirus facility-associated risk. Geneva, Switzerland.

Risks The likelihood of an accidental poliovirus release will depend on the number of facilities handling polioviruses and on the adherence to biorisk management standards applied during storage and manipulation of poliovirus-harboring materials. Two recent spills from vaccine production facilities have highlighted the possibility of this event.15,16 Deliberate release of wild, vaccine- or genetically- engineered polioviruses is also possible.17,18 The potential for poliovirus released from facilities to reinitiate transmission in surrounding communities will depend on several factors.19,20 First, the category of poliovirus-containing material released, as WPV and VDPVs are considered to have higher infectivity and transmissibility than OPV/Sabin strains. Cell cultures or concentrates used for vaccine production or certain tests have >10,000-fold higher concentration than stools or respiratory samples. Second, population immunity to poliovirus will decline with time, especially in countries with low routine vaccination coverage. Although provision of IPV through routine immunization will protect against paralysis and transmission of re-introduced polioviruses through the oropharyngeal route, it will confer very limited protection against intestinal infection and transmission through the fecal- oral route. Because of the phased cessation of OPV, low population immunity levels will occur earlier for type 2 than for types 1 and 3. Third, population density and migration, sanitation infrastructure and climate, as well as local surveillance and response capabilities may enhance or minimize spread. Considering these factors, modeling results indicate that a poliovirus release from vaccine production sites into countries with high transmission risk several years after bOPV cessation could result in uncontrollable transmission.21 Currently, most laboratories and vaccine production facilities are in Europe and North America, where community vaccination with IPV could prevent transmission following a poliovirus release; however, Sabin-IPV production may expand to middle- or low- income countries more likely to have conditions that facilitate community spread. 15 Duizer E, Ruijs WL, van der Weijden CP, Timen A.

Factors such as population density and migration, sanitation infrastructure and climate, as well as surveillance and response capabilites POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 14 B. Context GAPIII: Minimizing the risk of release from facilities The risk of accidental or intentional release of poliovirus could only be eliminated if all polioviruses were destroyed and never re-synthesized. Unfortunately, this is not achievable because polioviruses are still necessary for vaccine production and other functions. However, effective containment can decrease the risk to acceptable levels. GAPIII proposes two major strategies to achieve effective containment: 1) reduce the number of facilities that store or manipulate poliovirus, and 2) implement stringent containment safeguards in facilities that continue to handle poliovirus, as well as in their hosting countries. To reduce facilities harboring poliovirus, all countries need to conduct surveys and inventories of all laboratories and biomedical facilities, public and private, which may be storing polioviruses. Those facilities for which storing and handling poliovirus are not critical will need to destroy (or transfer) any infectious materials. Potentially infectious materials such as clinical specimens can be destroyed, transferred, or inactivated, depending on their likelihood of harboring polioviruses and on the consequences of their unsafe storage or handling.22 Laboratories will also have to implement safe and secure working practices for handling new specimens potentially harboring poliovirus (i.e., from areas with a new outbreak), and destroy, transfer, or contain those specimens if presence of the virus is confirmed. Facilities that need to store and handle polioviruses to perform critical functions (poliovirus- essential facilities, or PEFs), and their host countries, should implement and comply with several containment safeguards. Safeguards will be more stringent for WPV/VDPV than for OPV/Sabin poliovirus. Primary safeguards reduce the risk of accidental or intentional release of poliovirus from a facility. Key elements include modifications in facility infrastructure and management; use of biosafety and biosecurity procedures during manipulation, storage, and transport of potentially contaminated material; immunization of personnel; substitution of WPV with Sabin strains or further attenuated strains where possible; and contingency plans to respond to a poliovirus release or exposure. Secondary safeguards define vaccine-induced immunity requirements in the community to minimize the consequences of a poliovirus release. Tertiary safeguards , required only for facilities handling and storing WPV/VDPV, minimize the consequences of releases by locating facilities in areas with sewage infrastructure that reduces poliovirus transmission potential. 22 World Health Organization. Guidance for non-poliovirus facilities to minimize risk of sample collections potentially infectious for polioviruses. (in preparation). GAPIII Strategies for Containment 1. Reduce the number of facilities that store or manipulate poliovirus 2. Implement stringent containment safeguards in facilities that continue to handle poliovirus POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 15 Current mechanisms to monitor containment activities Several mechanisms have been created to provide oversight of the implementation of containment measures at the national and global level ( see Figure 3 ).23 To monitor progress in the global reduction of facilities with poliovirus, national polio containment coordinators (NPCCs) and National Certification Commissions (NCCs) prepare annual reports for the Regional Certification Commissions (RCCs) outlining how many facilities hold poliovirus materials and how many facilities plan to become PEFs, as well as progress in removing poliovirus materials from facilities not designated as PEFs. Figure 3. Current oversight structure of containment activities Facilities selected by national authorities to retain poliovirus and become PEFs are responsible for implementing primary safeguards. Countries hosting PEFs need to designate a national authority for containment (NAC) to certify that the PEFs and the country meet primary, secondary, and tertiary safeguards. The NAC will share the appropriate documentation with the WHO and the Containment Working Group of the Global Certification Commission (GCC-CWG) for verification and endorsement of the certification process. Two independent bodies support containment activities at the global level, providing reports and recommendations to the WHO Director General. The Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (GCC) acts as the oversight body to confirm the achievement of global containment of polioviruses. The Containment Advisory Group (CAG) advises on technical issues related to GAPIII (see Figure 3 ). 23 World Health Organization. Containment Certification Scheme to support the WHO Global Action Plan for poliovirus containment. Available at http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CCS_2016EN.pdf. POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 16 Current status of containment activities GAPIII implementation was arranged in three phases aligned with phased-OPV cessation.24 Phase I includes an inventory and reduction of facilities holding type 2 poliovirus materials; Phase II refers to containment of type 2 poliovirus; and Phase III refers to containment of all polioviruses. Phases I and II were to be implemented around the certification of WPV2 eradication in 2015 and after tOPV withdrawal in May 2016, respectively. Phase III implementation is expected to begin by the time all six WHO regions are certified as polio-free. Global implementation of containment is moving ahead but the schedule was delayed and Phases I and II are now progressing in parallel. To advance implementation during the endgame, the GPEI has increased technical support and funding for communications, advocacy, and training of stakeholders, including NACs and PEFs. The CAG recommendations and guidance for identifying and handling potentially infectious materials will address technical concerns from the biomedical community and will help countries meet containment requirements.25 C. What Will Be Done Strategic Priorities and Assumptions The central strategies to achieve and sustain poliovirus containment in the post-certification period are: 1) continue the process of reducing the number of facilities retaining polioviruses; and 2) oversee implementation of safeguards and continuously monitor compliance with containment requirements in facilities retaining poliovirus and their host countries. To inform post-certification containment activities, the following assumptions were used: Although GAPIII is expected to be revised during the endgame phase before certification, the revisions will likely address specific questions and challenges to implementation procedures, but the general strategies and guidelines will be upheld. By certification the number of facilities retaining poliovirus-containing materials will have decreased, but all the specific containment requirements established in GAPIII may not have been achieved. At the time of writing this document, the GCC is expected to outline revised containment conditions that will need to be in place for the certification of WPV eradication and bOPV withdrawal. By certification, some containment-specific functions may have transitioned out of the current GPEI management structure, but oversight will likely be conducted through a similar governance structure in the early post-certification stages (up to two years after bOPV cessation). 24 World Health Organization.

Guidance for non-poliovirus facilities to minimize risk of sample collections potentially infectious for polioviruses. (In preparation). POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 17 Activity 1.1.1 - Support the global reduction of facilities retaining poliovirus In preparation for bOPV withdrawal, countries will need to identify all facilities retaining any infectious or potentially infectious OPV/Sabin types 1 and 3 materials by updating the facility surveys conducted for type 2 poliovirus, which may also help in finding any remaining WPV or VDPV materials. Any facility not designated as a PEF will need to remove any poliovirus materials according to updated GAPIII and WHO guidelines.26 These activities should be coordinated with the withdrawal and the destruction of bOPV stocks as explained in Goal 2. To monitor this process, countries will share progress reports periodically with the GCC (through the RCCs or an alternative). To encourage global implementation, a status report could also be presented annually to the WHA. The GCC will also use a summary of country reports to certify containment of all polioviruses after bOPV withdrawal. Once this milestone is reached, facilities that have not received a containment certificate will no longer be allowed to handle or store any poliovirus materials. This may affect polio surveillance, vaccine production, outbreak response, and research (See Table 1) . Any country that experiences a poliovirus outbreak will have to update their facility survey to include laboratories that may have collected specimens contaminated with polioviruses and facilities that may have vaccine stocks\u2014and destroy or remove those materials. An international oversight body will monitor these activities to certify containment to polioviruses in the country after the outbreak. To support the global reduction of facilities retaining poliovirus, dedicated staff at the global and regional level will conduct the following activities: Develop guidelines and training for surveys and containment reports and share with countries Update communication and advocacy strategies to ensure cooperation from the biomedical community Provide assistance to countries on regulatory and technical issues related to the implementation of facility surveys and compliance with poliovirus containment requirements Coordinate submission of country reports to the RCC and GCC (or other oversight bodies) Provide technical assistance on containment to countries facing outbreaks after certification Coordinate meetings of countries and regions with oversight bodies to monitor progress in activities A high level of effort is expected for these activities during the first two to three years after certification, until the GCC certifies global implementation of containment to all polioviruses following bOPV withdrawal. New research developments may also help reduce the amount of required PEFs, such as the replacement of virus cultures with other assays for the diagnosis of poliovirus infection or the production of vaccines using genetically modified poliovirus strains or virus-like particles that do not require containment (see Research ). 26 World Health Organization. Guidance for non-poliovirus facilities to minimize risk of sample collections potentially infectious for polioviruses. (In preparation). POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 18 Activity 1.1.2 - Implement and monitor long-term poliovirus containment in facilities with appropriate safeguards The risk of poliovirus re-introduction from containment breaches will decrease with time after certification as the number of facilities retaining polioviruses declines and those facilities handling poliovirus implement safeguards appropriately. However, the potential consequences of a breach will rise as population immunity decreases with time.27 To mitigate these risks, it will be critical to maintain long-term national and international mechanisms that monitor facility adherence to containment requirements and retain technical and functional capacity for addressing new containment questions and responding efficiently to potential spills or community exposure. At the national level , PEFs will need to meet and maintain the safeguards required by GAP III and allow periodic assessment by auditors and NACs. NACs will renew, modify, or withdraw the certificates of containment, in coordination with the WHO and GCC-CWG (or other oversight body). At the global and regional level, staff with expertise in poliovirus containment will support PEFs, countries, and oversight groups through the following activities: Develop and regularly update guidelines and technical materials related to poliovirus containment for laboratory or research communities, governments, and regulatory agencies Provide technical assistance and expert containment advice on certification processes and questions related to poliovirus containment (see Table 1 for links with other polio functions) Maintain and regularly update a global inventory of PEFs Provide regular training on containment certification processes Support GCC-CWG activities, including the training of members, organization of meetings, and preparation of documentation necessary for review of containment certificates requests Provide secretariat functions to expert committees and oversight bodies (e.g., CAG, GCC) Provide technical assistance in investigating and responding to containment breaches in coordination with PEFs and outbreak response groups (national and international) The GCC-CWG will continue verification of containment certificates for new or existing PEFs until containment of all poliovirus following bOPV cessation is certified. After reaching that milestone, the assignment of this function and oversight role may be reassessed. The CAG or an equivalent expert advisory committee is likely to be required for several years after certification to answer new technical questions elicited by vaccine manufacturers, researchers, or others. In the long term, the CAG may merge with an expert body that reviews research on poliovirus, as was done with smallpox. 27 Duintjer Tebbens RJ, Pallansch MA, Cochi SL, Wassilak SG, Thompson KM.

Many countries have already discontinued the use of OPV and switched to IPV. Although IPV is highly effective in providing individual protection against paralysis, the vaccine's impact to limit transmission in settings with poor sanitation is less clear. Further challenges to the widespread introduction of IPV have been its cost and constrained global supply. These immediate challenges highlight the need for new immunization policies and strategies to ensure that long-term protection from any poliovirus re-emergence can be sustained throughout the post-certification period. Description of the Goal The goal of eliminating all paralytic polio disease and sustaining WPV eradication ultimately requires stopping all use of bOPV globally and continuing to immunize with other safe, effective polio vaccines. These dual efforts\u2014withdrawing bOPV and extending widespread IPV use in routine immunization to reach 90% seroconversion for each fully-vaccinated child\u2014will mitigate the risks from VAPP and VDPVs and protect against the possible re-emergence of WPV. Goal 2 2 GOAL POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 21 Objective 2.1: Protect populations from VAPP and VDPVs A. Context Following the declaration of WPV type 2 global eradication in September 2015, the GPEI initiated sequential steps to withdraw OPV. The first of these was the global withdrawal of the type 2- containing vaccine, trivalent OPV (tOPV), and the switch to bivalent OPV (bOPV) with only types 1 and 3, an event that was synchonized worldwide in April-May 2016 by 126 OPV-using countries. B. Risks Table 2.

Develop alternative polio vaccines (e.g., nOPVs) Risk of VDPV circulation from OPV can continue for several years after cessation.29 Failure to target high-risk groups and achieve adequate population immunity in pre- cessation SIAs can raise the threat of VDPV emergence and spread.30 Risk of mOPVs resulting in VDPV transmission beyond an outbreak zone may increase with time after cessation31 28 See Annex B for details on projected magnitude of risk for VAPP and VDPV in the post-certification era. 29 Grassley NC.

What Will Be Done Activity 2.1.1 - Develop and implement plans (including pre-cessation SIAs) to withdraw bOPV from all use While the GPEI established a general framework in 2005 for the eventual withdrawal of OPV after certification, the lessons learned from the tOPV switch provide supplemental guidelines for bOPV cessation. Withdrawing bOPV after global certification, however, represents a new challenge: the complete cessation, not simply a switch, of live polio vaccines. 34,35 Three core strategies can be identified for bOPV cessation, even as comprehensive operational details are still forthcoming. 1. Obtain clear commitment from all OPV-using countries to cease bOPV-use modeled after the endorsement of the switch at the WHA in May 2015,36 and fully engage stakeholders at all levels in the planning, preparation, implementation, and validation of global bOPV withdrawal. 2. Develop and aggressively implement pre-cessation risk mitigation measures necessary to meet multiple readiness criteria for full bOPV withdrawal.37 32 Tebbens RJD, et al.

POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 23 Specific targets will be established for each criterion to reflect the parameters required at the global and/or country level to minimize and manage the risks associated with final bOPV cessation. The readiness criteria are: a. Pre-cessation immunity for types 1 and 3, see panel (at right) b. IPV supply and status of global introduction, see panel and Objective 2.2 c. Poliovirus surveillance, see Objective 3.1 d. Outbreak response capacity, see Objective 3.2 e. Containment of poliovirus, see Goal 1 f. Epidemiologic status, e.g., lack of persistent cVDPVs 3. Implement the operational planning and withdrawal process based on clearly identified steps which actively mitigate the risks associated with cessation. To maximize population immunity for types 1 and 3, country-level withdrawal of bOPV should be scheduled as soon as feasibly possible after global certification, ideally within 12 months. Global preparation for this operationally challenging event will need to begin well in advance (18-24 months) prior to implementation. Certification and other markers of epidemiologic achievement, such as the lack of persistent cVPDVs for at least six months, will need to be designated to activate both preparation and final planning. Key strategies to mitigate risks associated with implementation include: a. Synchronize bOPV cessation globally Global synchronization of the withdrawal of bOPV after certification within a fixed two- week period should ensure that no country is inadvertently put at risk of importing Sabin OPV or VDPV from a country that continues to use bOPV in routine immunization. b. Ensure complete withdrawal of bOPV at cessation Direct communication with the public and healthcare providers should emphasize the need and importance of stopping all bOPV use. Additionally, a comprehensive monitoring and validation process should be put in place to confirm compliance with directives to collect and destroy all remaining vials from local providers and throughout the cold chain given Pre-Cessation Immunity By inducing mucosal immunity for types 1 and 3, pre-cessation bOPV SIAs can maximize protection against future VDPVs. Not all areas may require such additional efforts. Priority should be given to achieving maximum quality SIAs in areas with high risk of infection and low routine immunization coverage. Further analysis of risk and local epidemiology will guide which implementation option will be most effective. Countries using bOPV have been advised to introduce IPV.to provide individual protection against paralysis. However, IPV use, even with high coverage, may not prevent cVDPVs in areas with intense fecal-oral transmission. Countries which have not been able to obtain adequate IPV supplies for all birth cohorts prior to cessation can also be more vulnerable after they stop bOPV. Additional IPV will be provided to 'catch- up' missed cohorts once supplies become available but the timing and coverage of these efforts remain to be determined. Sources: Tebbens RJD, et al.

The GPEI will explore with relevant countries whether manufacturers should securely retain any remaining bOPV stocks until expiration for potential outbreak response or safely dispose at time of bOPV withdrawal. Objective 2.2: Provide access to safe, effective polio vaccines for long-term protection A. Context The plan to introduce at least one dose of IPV by mid-2016 in all 126 OPV-only using countries has been only partially implemented due to severe global constraints on IPV supply. To offset shortages, some countries have utilized fractional IPV or fIPV (intradermal adminstration of 1/5th of the full dose given intramuscularly), while others have either suspended IPV or defered IPV introduction. High-income and many middle-income countries have already introduced IPV either as a stand-alone antigen or more commonly in a combination vaccine. In 2016, 42 countries reported using hexavalent (DTaP-Hib-HepB-IPV) and 39 reported using pentavalent (DTaP-Hib-IPV) in their EPI schedules.39 B. Risks Table 3.

What Will Be Done Activity 2.2.1 Implement future immunization policy to protect population against poliovirus Future immunization policy and coverage targets in the post-certification era will be a consensus of guidelines and recommendations from advisory groups (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization [SAGE] and Containment Advisory Group [CAG]) and key contributing partners (GVAP) to achieve protection against poliomyelitis. While specifics may change prior to certification based on additional research, SAGE put forward recommendations for future global polio vaccination policy which set expectations for national EPI programmes after global bOPV withdrawal (see panel, next page). This proposed schedule from SAGE is designed to achieve durable individual immunity through providing at least 90% seroconversion and robust antibody titers to all three poliovirus serotypes. The designated age at first dose and dosing interval will offer maximum vaccine efficacy42 and accommodate existing EPI contacts for diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and measles. The current recommendations apply to stand-alone IPV. Future recommendations will include specifics for combination vaccines containing IPV. 41 http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tswucoveragepol3.html 42 For summary of IPV clinical trials see: Concepcion F Estivariz, et al. Poliovirus vaccination options for achieving eradication and securing the endgame. Current Opinion in Virology 2013, 3:309-315 POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 26 The recommendations from SAGE acknowledge the programmatic equivalency of fractional or full-dose IPV when the first dose is given at or after two months of age.43 This policy provides long-term options for countries which could reduce costs and stretch vaccine supplies. Further research will be needed to determine the effectiveness and duration of immunity delivered by each delivery method (intramuscular for IPV and intradermal for fIPV). The recommendation to use IPV for 10+ years addresses the need to provide long-term global protection, at least through the intermediate post- cessation period, against the small but continuing risk of poliovirus. The recommendation should also signal to vaccine manufacturers the potential future demand for IPV (also see Activity 2.2.2). While the SAGE recommendations are focused on providing universal standards required for individual protection, the population immunity achieved through this schedule for a country or region will be dependent on the coverage that is attained. As currently set by GVAP, the coverage target for all vaccines in national immunization programmes is at least 90% national vaccination coverage and at least 80% vaccination coverage in every district or equivalent administrative unit.44 GAPIII has also set specific coverage targets to reflect potentially higher risks for PEF-hosting countries.45 After bOPV cessation, GAP III requires that countries with PEFs containing OPV/Sabin materials provide at least one dose of IPV (equal to DTP 3 coverage) and countries with PEFs containing WPV materials provide at least three doses of IPV (greater than 90% coverage). As additional countries with large populations (such as China, India, and Indonesia) establish PEFs, international advisory groups (e.g., SAGE, CAG, and the GCC) may choose to further refine the parameters and expected geographic scope of these recommendations. 43 For summary analysis of fIPV see: Okayasu H, et al.

Specifically, high coverage will require: 1) global capacity and willingness to produce sufficient vaccine supply; 2) national commitment, finances, and infrastructure capacity to purchase and deliver the vaccine; and 3) community acceptance for children to be vaccinated. The strategies noted below are targeted to IPV; however, it should be noted that in the post- certification era, when polio immunization is globally integrated into routine programmes, these strategies should be part of a coherent set of activities which promote overall sustainability of immunization efforts and high coverage with all vaccines. Determine demand for IPV and facilitate adequate long-term supply of appropriate IPV products Gavi and the GPEI have updated the \"The IPV Supply and Procurement Roadmap\" that analyzes the demand and supply dynamics of IPV for the longer term. The IPV Roadmap aims to define actions which may positively impact the IPV market to achieve a healthy market over time, which is characterized by ensuring sufficient supply, improving pricing, and supporting the availability of new innovative vaccines.46 While initially focused on solutions to the global supply shortage, recent updates of the Roadmap include longer-term projections covering the post-certification period based on broad-based scenarios and assumptions (see Figure 4 ). Assumptions relevant for the post-certification era include: Countries which have been using IPV for many years and are self-procuring (primarily upper- middle income countries) are expected to continue IPV vaccination using their own resources. For previously OPV-using countries, the long-term demand for IPV and IPV-combination vaccines will change over time and depend on multiple factors, including: timing of global bOPV cessation and when countries will be expected to implement the two-dose regimen recommended by SAGE; pricing and available financing; national product preference and use of fractional doses; perceived future risk of poliomyelitis for their population; and availability of new/improved products. By 2023, IPV supply should be sufficient to enable all countries to switch to two full IPV doses. 46 Gavi and GPEI. IPV supply and procurement summary.

The IPV Roadmap is updated in relation to major procurement activies such as new tenders and provides visibility to manufacturers and stakeholders on expectations related to supply and demand. All 126 countries which were using tOPV only committed to implement the SAGE recommendation (from October 2016) to introduce at least one IPV dose into RI. 47 However, long- term demand for IPV remains uncertain. Aside from countries with PEFs, which will be expected to meet IPV-use requirements under GAPIII, other countries may take the SAGE recommendation into consideration as part of their own cost-benefit analysis on using IPV in the post-certification era. As such, demand forecasts should be regularly revised based on a study of country preferences and vaccination policies. As countries make decisions on IPV use, they should be supported on the global level through communications about the role of IPV in protecting against the re-emergence of the virus. Similarly, ongoing engagements with incumbent and new IPV manufacturers should be continued to facilitate decisions on long-term supply. 47 IVB/WHO Immunization Repository POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 29 Facilitate development of IPV products to stretch supply and maximize affordability Several vaccine dose-sparing strategies have been developed and additional IPV products are in the pipeline which may stretch supply and maximize affordability. Two such approaches include: fractional IPV (fIPV) dosing and adjuvanted vaccines. The long-term global impact on IPV supply and cost of other options, such as combination vaccines or Sabin strain IPV (sIPV), remain to be determined. Scientific data confirming the immunogenicity of intradermal (ID) fIPV and country experience demonstrating its operational feasibility provide strong evidence for the potential broader use of fractional dosing.48 SAGE has endorsed the use of fractional dosing and encouraged countries to consider the use of fIPV based on their independent assessment of clinical data.49 Although initially developed as a method to extend limited vaccine supplies, fIPV can also provide cost savings if appropriate vial sizes are available and ID delivery device costs can be decreased.50 The use of fIPV, however, remains off-label, and active engagement with global and national regulators may be required to manage liability issues. Adjuvanted vaccines are also being pursued to improve the intestinal mucosal immunity generated by IPV and to increase the vaccine's affordability by reducing the amount of poliovirus antigen needed per dose. Use of aluminum salts as IPV adjuvants have been shown to promote dose-sparing and are already widely used safely in other vaccines. Other novel adjuvants show promise to reduce the risk of shedding and environmental transmission of poliviruses. (See Research. ) Combining antigens can stimulate community demand and improve efficiency of delivery. Combination vaccines containing IPV and using acelluar pertussis are currently widely used in developed countries, but are currently more expensive when compared with pentavalent vaccine plus stand-alone IPV. IPV combination vaccines using whole cell pertussis are under development. Whether this fourmulation will be sufficiently cheaper to attract middle-income countries remains to be determined. By competing for the same bulk as stand-alone IPV, combination vaccines may also have a problematic impact on global IPV supply at least for the foreseeable future. Since sIPV uses attenuated Sabin virus strains rather than WPV in production, they are less likely to cause problems for containment. While they may potentially provide more affordable, effective options against stopping poliovirus transmission the costs, efficacy, and feasibility of large-scale production are still being evaluated. (See Research section.) Advocate for sustainable financing of IPV Low-income countries are expected to receive Gavi funding through 2020 to support the current SAGE recommendation for all countries to introduce a single full dose or two fractional doses of IPV for routine EPI. Decisions for funding Gavi-supported countries from 2021 onward are 48 Okayasu H, et al.

There is consideration to include IPV as a \"global public good\" under a new Vaccine Investment Strategy. The number and type of dosing, length of funding, and specifics on vaccine schedules all remain to be determined. Facilitate effective and efficient delivery of IPV By the time of certification, IPV will no longer be a \"new vaccine\" for any country; however, depending on when adequate supplies become globally available, some countries still may be in the process of fully integrating the vaccine into regular use. To successfully make this change to the EPI schedule, some key steps should be undertaken well in advance and implemented in close coordination with bOPV cessation. They include: training health workers, developing and implementing communications with caregivers and parents, instituting any required changes in cold-chain and vaccine management, and revising immunization records. Intradermal (ID) fIPV in routine immunization has had success in some countries (such as India and Sri Lanka), though others have reservations about the increased operational requirements and training required for ID delivery. Several alternatives to Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) syringes have been developed and widely tested.51 These options are still relatively expensive and some require intensive re-training of health care workers. Nevertheless, they may present viable methods to increase the efficiency of ID delivery in the future. Field experience and collaboration with manufacturers should provide ways to bring down costs and increase acceptance among policy makers and healthcare workers. Additionally, studies are underway to determine the efficacy of fractional intramuscular (IM) dosing which would rely on regular syringes. The country transition planning process, supported by the GPEI, aims to identify how polio resources, human capacity, and knowledge can be directed to achieve GVAP and broader public health goals. Overall strengthening of RI must be a critical priority for attaining these broader goals, as well as sustaining the functions essential to protecting populations from future polio emergences. As partners develop \"GVAP 2.0,\" sustaining polio eradication should be a core objective. The current GVAP Strategic Objective 3 highlights the requirement to ensure that the benefits of immunization are equitably extended to all people and includes strategies to reach hard-to-reach communities.52 These generic strategies should be relevant for extending polio vaccination to populations at high risk for the re-emergence of polioviruses. Additional strategies for reaching these high-risk populations for poliovirus detection and outbreak response are explored in Goal Three. 51 Okayasu H, et al.

In the post-certification era, minimizing the risks of delayed detection or inadequate response will involve building on current capacity and adapting to a new world where polio is an eradicated pathogen. The underlying principle guiding post-certification detection and response is that, under the IHR, the discovery of any poliovirus (WPV, VDPV, or Sabin more than 4 months after last use of mOPV or post-bOPV cessation) must be reported to WHO and will lead to the declaration of a national public health emergency and response.53 Depending on the risk of international spread, the detection could constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) requiring a prompt, globally-coordinated response. Fulfilling this principle requires sensitive surveillance, adequate outbreak preparedness, and the capacity to respond effectively. 53 See WHO. International Health Regulations (2005), Third Edition. Geneva, 2016. http://www.who.int/ihr/publications/9789241580496/en/ Goal 3 3 GOAL POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 32 Description of the Goal Polio surveillance in the post-certification era will take a risk-based approach by prioritizing risks, clarifying risk tolerance, and developing risk mitigation measures. Using this approach, the general goal of post-certification surveillance will be twofold: 1. For high-risk areas, surveillance strategies not only target any case of poliomyelitis, but also provide early detection of any poliovirus or low-level transmission. 2. For lower-risk areas with limited opportunities for widespread transmission, the goal of surveillance will be to detect clusters of poliovirus or evidence of relatively higher levels of transmission. The public health infrastructure required to support the post-certification surveillance strategies of rapid detection, notification, and information sharing, should also provide a robust response to prevent circulation or stop transmission. Although primary responsibility for response rests with emergency operation core capacities, which all countries are expected to establish and maintain under the IHR, there should be adequate global and regional capacity and resources to support national efforts, especially in high-risk areas. Objective 3.1: Prompt detection and sensitive surveillance A. Context Given the potentially severe threats to global health security from any PHEIC, such as poliovirus, the IHR requires that countries have the capacity to provide early warning and response (EWAR).54 IHR monitoring protocols for infectious diseases, as supplemented by the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), recommend that countries use indicator-based surveillance (IBS) systems from routine or sentinel site surveillance, and event-based surveillance (EBS) systems designed to detect and respond to signals from formal and informal sources of information. 55 AFP surveillance, backed by the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN), is an example of an IBS system which has been the cornerstone of polio eradication efforts. Countries which have experienced transmission within recent decades have established separate, vertical AFP surveillance structures alongside other multi-disease IBS in order to provide rapid, case-based detection ( See Annex D ). AFP surveillance has been supplemented by environmental surveillance (ES) in selected countries. Developed countries have tended to rely on non-specific enterovirus surveillance (EVS) as the primary means to detect polio AFP cases. 54 WHO.

Potential detection risks and mitigation measures Risk Mitigation Measures Technical Note Substantially delayed detection of poliovirus emergence or transmission Integrate AFP with other VPD/communicable disease surveillance systems to sustain capacity as recommended Continue active, case- based AFP surveillance in high risk areas; focus on sentinel sites as required Increase sensitivity of polio surveillance by utilizing a mix of surveillance systems (e.g., environmental, enterovirus, event-based, community-based) especially in high-risk areas AFP surveillance sensitivity can decline as countries shift to integrated systems or passive approaches where poliovirus detection is considered a relatively low priority. Integration has the potential to disrupt operational efficiency of vertical AFP surveillance systems. Timing of integration should be paced to maintain required sensitivity in high- risk areas. There is an inherently limited sensitivity of AFP surveillance since clear majority of polio infections are asymptomatic.56 Low-level poliovirus transmission can continue undetected for many months in areas using only IPV.57 In suitable locations, environmental surveillance can provide more sensitive detection of polioviruses than AFP surveillance alone.58 Missed poliovirus cases/transmission among populations who are hard-to- reach or inaccessible (e.g., in remote or insecure areas) or who do not access health systems (e.g., in urban slums) Develop and implement specific strategies to reach high-risk populations These same populations may be highly vulnerable to polio infections due to low vaccination coverage, poor sanitation, etc. 56 Grassly NC.

Areas of high risk of iVDPV appear to be different from those at risk for other poliovirus emergences. Failure to detect containment breach in poliovirus- containing facility or surrounding community Develop comprehensive detection plans targeted to specific environments of poliovirus-containing facilities Complicated regulatory oversight and containment requirements (see Goal 1) C. What Will Be Done The forthcoming Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan (GPSAP) will establish global strategies and technical guidance to achieve global certification of WPV eradication, strategies which are also critical for the post-certification era.59 The PCS focuses more specifically on the baseline global surveillance strategies and standards required to mitigate risks after WPV eradication\u2014 and future revisions will reflect expectations set by the GCC and RCCs leading up to certification. Activity 3.1.1. - Redefine the polio surveillance paradigm Currently, poliovirus surveillance adheres to commonly used steps for identifying and controlling all communicable disease outbreaks: detection, confirmation, notification, risk assessment, and response. A country's specific strategies and standards for poliovirus surveillance are based on whether or not it is in a WHO region which has certified WPV eradication. In the post-certification era, the steps for identifying and controlling communicable diseases will still apply, but the paradigm for poliovirus surveillance will need continual refinements to address new challenges and mitigate the risk of delayed detection. The specific stategies and standards applicable at the country level will be based on the risk of poliovirus re-emergence. The system for classifying each country's risk (see Annex C ) allows for risk to be dynamic, with countries or large areas moving between risk strata over time and risk differing by poliovirus category (e.g., WPV, cVDPV, iVDPV). The future paradigm not only reframes risk, but also modifies specific approaches for AFP surveillance and incorporates key additional strategies required in the post-certification period (See Table 5 ). The proposed approaches and strategies attempt to balance multiple 59 GPEI. Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan. (in draft) POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 35 considerations: the probability and consequences of poliovirus re-emergence, intensity of effort required to maintain standards, and evolution of risk over time. Table 5. Current and redefined paradigms for poliovirus surveillance Current paradigm Redefined paradigm Strategies in focus areas Countries in non-certified regions Primarily active, case-based AFP surveillance with multiple facility & community reporting sites; often separate from other IBS systems Supplemented by ES High-risk areas Priority on AFP surveillance but continued integration with other VPD surveillance and IBS systems; gradual shift to focus on sentinel sites and passive approaches Increasing reliance on ES; mix of strategies evolving over time; supplement with EBS Strategies in other areas Countries in certified regions Mix of AFP, ES, and EVS Medium- and low-risk areas Continued mix of AFP, ES, EVS strategies Incorporate poliovirus detection into global and national level EBS Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) organization Polio-specific laboratories linked in a tiered network with designated capacities Maintain GPLN; polio-specific laboratories continue at global/regional levels, but become integrated virology laboratories at national level; Potential for improved, faster diagnostics; more stringent containment requirements Key additional strategies Limited iVDPV global registry Ad-hoc surveillance strategies around PEFs Develop more comprehensive surveillance for PID patients to detect iVDPV Develop global standards for community surveillance around PEFs Polio Surveillance Paradigm: Five Essential Strategies Beyond the mimimum capacity to provide early warning for global public health security threats as required for all countries under IHR, the post-certification surveillance paradigm proposes five essential strategies to ensure specific detection of any poliovirus re-emergence. The appropriate strategies and expected standards for each country will depend on its risk status and stage since certification. (See Table 6 below for details.) 1. Implement an appropriate mix of AFP surveillance, environmental surveillance, and enterovirus surveillance, with supplemental activities for high-risk, hard-to-reach populations or areas AFP Surveillance Except for low-risk countries with highly developed health systems, AFP should remain a priority disease or condition with a standardized syndromic definition under any POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 36 comprehensive routine or early warning surveillance system. Each polio AFP case must be immediately reported to national authorities and investigated at the local level, including stool collection and follow-up. Countries should tailor and evolve their specific parameters for AFP surveillance, whether active vs. passive, population-based vs. sentinel sites, community- vs. facility-based, or integrated vs. single-disease structure. Additionally, surveillance standards (such as NPAFP rate and stool adequacy percent) will evolve over time and by country risk category to meet required levels of sensitivity. Environmental Surveillance Since 2015, Environmental Surveillance (ES) has expanded among polio-endemic and high- risk countries, where it is used to detect low-level transmission or provide an early indication of importation, especially in areas with possible gaps in AFP surveillance.60 Because the benefits of ES will increase as the detectable paralysis-to-infection ratio of polio decreases, the GPEI is preparing a revised long-term strategy to reflect increased reliance on this method.61 In the post-certification era, the projected roles for ES include: Aid in tracking the elimination of Sabin viruses after bOPV cessation or use of mOPV Continue to support early detection of poliovirus circulation Monitor the geographic extent of transmission Guide outbreak response planning and monitor efficacy Whereas current ES site selection is driven by the epidemiology of poliovirus circulation, in the post-certification era it will be based on areas or populations deemed vulnerable for re- emergence. Future site selection for both national and sub-national locations should be based on comprehensive risk analysis, with consideration to the surveillance and laboratory capacity required to sustain quality. ES could prove critically useful for monitoring in hard-to-reach or security-compromised areas, or following a facility or laboratory breach. Nevertheless, ES has potential limitations in terms of geographic locations where it can be applied, interpretation of findings, and technical implementation.62 Although no other disease control programme currently uses an extensive ES network as part of routine surveillance, there is a Global Sewage Surveillance Program (GSSP) which tracks antimicrobial resistance by sampling sewage from urban areas in more than 100 countries, two to four times per year.63 This cross-sectional testing may not provide timely or sensitive detection, but it could provide added confidence of the absence of poliovirus transmission. 60 WHO.

EVS is primarily a passive, laboratory-based system which collects stool, respiratory specimens or cerebral spinal fluid from a range of patients showing clinical symptoms of EV infection, including AFP. To be an effective tool for poliovirus surveillance, an EVS system should have known sensitivity and specificity based on several variables\u2014 such as the proportion of population under surveillance, the proportion of patients with specific clinical illness that are tested for enteroviruses, the type of sample tested, and standardized, quality-controlled laboratory procedures.64 Given the challenges in meeting these criteria, future use of EVS may be restricted to countries with relatively well-established health systems. It may prove advantageous with specific high-risk urban populations or subpopulation groups as long as the case definition includes patients with unexplained neurological clinical presentations and stool specimens are collected and tested for enterovirus. Supplemental Surveillance Activities for High-Risk Populations and Areas Geographic, political, and social constraints create surveillance challenges with populations who either cannot or chose not to access health services .65 These challenges can limit the value and sensitivity of AFP surveillance, as either a vertical or integrated system. To address these challenges, supplemental strategies have been implemented at the national and sub- national level.66 In the post-certification era, these efforts will be intensified, especially the use of community-based surveillance (CBS) among hard-to-reach populations. Global and regional efforts should be directed toward coordination, communication, and outreach tactics for intensified surveillance in high-risk intercountry areas (Lake Chad) or conflict zones. 2. Use event-based surveillance for early warning of potential poliovirus circulation Event-based surveillance (EBS) is the organized collection, monitoring, assessment, and interpretation of mainly unstructured ad-hoc information regarding health events or risks, which may represent an acute risk to human health.67 For polio surveillance, triggers relevant to the re-emergence of polioviruses will need to be introduced into the algorithms tracking ad-hoc, informal sources. Although the sensitivity to detect a single polio AFP case is low, EBS can assist with early detection of possible re- emergence (e.g., media reports of clusters of paralyzed children) and thereby increase the overall sensitivity of polio surveillance. Global-level monitoring can identify mass population movements or emerging conflicts which can help direct national surveillance resources to 64 WHO EURO and US CDC. Enterovirus surveillance guidelines. Copenhagen, 2015 65 These groups include: populations inaccessible due to insecurity or geographic isolation; failed states; ethnic minorities; migrants or nomads; internally displaced persons or refugees; or those living in densely populated urban areas, particularly slums 66 See WHO.

Countries can also add indirect and direct reports from the community, NGOs, informal community healthcare providers, or other sources of information such as social media or a national hotline.68 Signals from EBS will require investigation and laboratory confirmation, but filters will be needed to avoid overwhelming the system with false-positives. The IHR authorizes WHO to review unofficial reports of public health events and obtain verification from Member States concerning such events.69 As part of national early warning and response systems in high- risk countries, Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) at the national or provincial level should include AFP as part of their regular monitoring of both IBS and EBS for signals of potential public health threats. 3. Develop surveillance among individuals with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) to detect and treat poliovirus excretors Countering iVDPV risks requires early identification and treatment of individuals with PID who are excreting poliovirus. Since 2005, there has been a marked increase in known iVDPV cases, identified primarily in middle-income countries. However, the current and future prevalence of asymptomatic iVDPV excretors is difficult to quantify. Documented community spread remains extremely rare\u2014and risks of transmissibility from asymptomatic long-term iVDPV excretors are also not fully known. The possibility that one or more PID patients may continue to excrete iVDPVs for several years after OPV cessation represents a possible, but highly uncertain risk for reintroduction of live polioviruses after OPV cessation.70 (See also Activity 3.2.1 .) The identification of iVDPV excretors without paralysis through, for example, testing initiated by the presentation of other symptoms or contact sampling shows that AFP surveillance alone is not sufficient. Other options that are currently being piloted include: 1) identifying excretors among patients with PID (particularly B-cell) through immunology networks,71 and 2) conducting PID screening in all children with or without paralysis younger than 15 years of age and attending a health facility within the AFP-reporting network.72 Better understanding of the risk, including prevalence and survivability of PID patients and the transmissibility of iVDPV, will help determine a long-term strategy. Further development of bedside quantitative immunoglobulin testing also has the potential to greatly facilitate screening. Countries assessed as high-risk for iVDPV excretors will most likely require some measure of continued periodic screening of PID patients and follow-up of any identified chronic excretors. The extent to which this strategy is adopted by other countries will depend on tolerance towards undetected iVDPV excretion. Enhanced surveillance (e.g., frequent 68 WHO/WPRO.

Develop plans to detect any containment breach within PEFs and the community As part of the primary safeguards mandated under GAPIII, all PEFs must conduct a risk assessment plan to detect any breach within their facility. To minimize risks, GAPIII also suggests locating PEFs in areas with effective AFP and environmental surveillance and efficient public health and response capacity. Given the potential consequences of a containment spill, additional global guidance will be developed to provide PEFs and national authorities with appropriate surveillance requirements. NACs may also develop country- specific guidelines for community surveillance. 5. Maintain core polio laboratories and enhance innovations for rapid, reliable confirmation All polio laboratories should continue to follow WHO-validated, standardized methodologies which will be continually updated to reflect the changing epidemiology of polio. Future laboratory innovations and activities include: Improve sample collection, transport, and processing methods. After certification, the number of stool samples from AFP cases may decline; however, the ES workload will likely increase as this system gains use. Maintaining or improving laboratory efficiency will require innovations in the concentration and processing of ES samples (see Research) . Even in locations without ES, containment requirements will necessitate some new approaches (See Goal 1, Table 2 ). Improve diagnostics and testing algorithms . Cell culture provides the highest diagnostic sensitivity and should be retained for processing stool samples in high- risk areas, as well as for all ES samples until other methods have been validated. Direct detection methods are now being tested which have the potential to provide faster results and simpler processing. As these methods become validated, they can be phased into wider use. Continue global accreditation to ensure quality control . Confidence in results from the GPLN has been dependent on a rigorous accreditation process for all laboratories. In the post-certification period, global experts should continue annual on-site reviews to ensure quality assurance and control.73 73 For additional details and proposed operational strategies for the post-certification period see Global Polio Laboratory Network Strategic Plan.

Sustain adequate and technically qualified surveillance and laboratory infrastructure capacity, including information systems Global/regional surveillance responsibilities Expectations for global and regional level surveillance activities are outlined in Table 7. The scope and intensity of global support will gradually decrease over time, but the capacity to monitor quality and provide expert advice should be maintained. Regional capacity and support will depend on the risk level of their countries. Regions with multiple high-risk countries should pay attention to cross-border areas and may need to directly support active sentinel site surveillance, at least through Year 5 post-certification. National level surveillance responsibilities In keeping with the IHR expectation that each country should have core capacity to detect any potential PHEIC, primary responsibility for poliovirus surveillance lies at the national level. However, in the post-certification era, surveillance required beyond the core capacity will depend on individual country risk. (See Table 7) Laboratory capacity and infrastructure After certification, the GPLN must retain the capability to sustain polio eradication by testing stool and environmental samples and providing molecular epidemiological data. All countries should be able to confirm poliovirus either through national laboratories or efficient transportation channels. Sequencing will be increasingly important but not required in all locations. Economic, epidemiological, and containment considerations will influence the number, location, and diagnostic capacities at the global, regional, and national levels (see Table 7). The GPLN will propose specific requirements for the global and regional levels, but each country will need to determine its own laboratory structure.

Countries with laboratories maintain VI and FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 45 Information management Access to reliable, quality, and timely AFP, laboratory, and environmental surveillance data, currently provided by the web-based polio information system (POLIS), will continue to be a strategic priority. High-quality data is critical not only to detect infections; it also helps in monitoring risk and surveillance performance. Depending on levels of responsibilty, future public health staff will need ready access to aggregate AFP reporting, linked laboratory/case-based data, IPV coverage data, and streamlined indicators of any SIA implementation. Especially wherever passive AFP is the primary mode of surveillance, clinicians and community informants will need to be efficiently linked to central public health infrastructures to report suspicions of AFP. Mobile phones are already widely used and there should be full utilization of new technologies in mobile health (\"mHealth\") and innovations such as Auto-Visual AFP Detection and Reporting (AVADAR).74 Just as AFP reporting is globally standardized, it will become increasingly important in the post- certification period to develop similar standardized approaches for ES data. There also will be a need to maintain a global repository of poliovirus nucleotide sequences (\"PONS\") to facilitate tracking any detected poliovirus. At the country level, any information system in the post-certification period should account for the specific data requirements related to country risk. High-risk countries should be able to continue reporting case-based AFP data to regional and global levels at least through Stage II. Global options for meeting these requirements include: (1) using POLIS as a platform for other vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) with common data requirements, such as measles/rubella; (2) integrating polio data into an \"EPI Information System\" for all VPDs; or (3) relying on broader communicable disease monitoring under integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) systems. Some combination of approaches may be an option, though data validation will be required and a centralized global database for AFP should be maintained. Objective 3.2: Adequate response capacity A. Context In order to respond promptly and effectively to public health risks and PHEICs as required by the IHR (2005), countries should develop preparedness plans and the capacity to implement public health emergency response operations, including risk communication.75 The IHR obligates WHO to assist country capacity and provide support if local resources are insufficient. 74 See WHO. mHealth: new horizons for health through global technologies.

IPV is highly effective in protecting individual recipients through humoral immunity, but role in stopping fecal-oral transmission is more limited; duration of protection of two- dose schedule is unknown.76 Forecasting stockpile requirements for mOPV and IPV can be problematic. PAVDs under development show promise of efficacy; however, at least two drugs with differing mechanisms of action will most likely be required to avoid high levels of drug resistance.77 See Research for new vaccines, Activity 2.2.2 for enhanced delivery methods 76 Ibid Bandyopadhyay AS, et al.

What Will Be Done Activity 3.2.1. Identify future outbreak risks, develop preparedness plans and response strategies, and sustain trained human capacity to appropriately implement these plans and strategies Future outbreak risks Global and regional forecasting based on AFP-based susceptibility indicators and other information (such as IPV coverage, migration data, or presence of humanitarian emergencies) should help identify countries or areas at risk for either immediate or long-term possible poliovirus re-emergence. Further analysis, including type-specific risks, trends, and quantification of potential emergences, should be periodically conducted to provide additional guidance on future programme priorities and resource requirements (see Annex B ). Country risk assessments should also be used to drive preparedness and response strategies (see Annex C) . Preparedness strategies Global public health staff should develop and regularly update technical support plans and poliovirus-specific outbreak response guidelines. All countries should include detection of a poliovirus as a possible scenario in their communicable disease outbreak preparedness response plans. Countries assessed as high-risk should develop and regularly review detailed polio-specific guidelines and periodically conduct a polio outbreak simulation exercise (POSE) at least through Stage IIA. High-risk countries and medium-risk countries should also ensure training on a regular basis for core staff at the national level through this same period. Especially for high-risk countries, Joint External Evaluations (JEE) assessing national capacity should identify areas in need of strengthening to maximize readiness for a poliovirus outbreak.79 78 Estivariz, CF, et al. Paralytic poliomyelitis associated with Sabin monovalent and bivalent oral polio vaccines in Hungary. Am J Epidemiol. 2011 Aug 1;174(3):316-25. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwr070. Epub 2011 Jun 17. 79 WHO.

Existing operating procedures which provide guidance on risk assessment, control measures, and monitoring specific for responding to detection of a verified poliovirus will be updated prior to certification to reflect lessons learned, new considerations for polio as an eradicated pathogen, and unprecedented low global population immunity. 81 Vaccine response strategies Vaccine response strategies required after bOPV cessation should be proposed now in order to determine requirements for vaccine stockpiles (See Activity 3.2.2). Although unlikely (except through a containment breach or chronic iVPDV excretor), detection of a poliovirus in a country with good sanitation, where primary transmission is expected to be oropharyngeal, should be responded to with IPV. If poliovirus is detected in areas where primary transmission is expected to be fecal-oral, vaccine response will be the homotypic mOPV related to the detected poliovirus, even if IPV has already been introduced into RI. As time after bOPV cessation increases and population mucosal immunity decreases, there is a risk that mOPV use could trigger new cVPDVs outside the outbreak zone.82 Adding IPV preemptively as a ring around an initial SIA target population is a potential strategy to reduce this risk that needs further research.83 Given the risks of mOPV use and the limitations of IPV in areas with poor sanitation, developing alternative vaccines such as nOPV (see Research ) is critical for sustaining eradication. Special response considerations Hard-to-reach populations . Vaccination responses in areas of conflict, refugee camps, or dense urban communities may require modifications to the general guidelines to maximize SIA quality.84 PID patients and iVPDV .

The majority of OPV-infected PID patients spontaneously stop excreting any poliovirus in fewer than 6 months. A minority of PID patients excrete iVDPVs for >6 months and very few excrete chronically (>5 years).85 These groups pose the primary risk for potential community transmission and are the priority for treatment. PAVDs currently under development show promising results and one agent, pocapavir, is presently available for compassionate use while the ultimate combination antiviral product is developed (see Research) . Further information on the specific types of PID most prone to excretion and the risk of iVPDV transmissibility will guide development of strategies for where, when, and how to most effectively treat PID patients excreting poliovirus. In addition to treating individuals, community-based strategies should be introduced to reduce the risk of transmission. Detection of an iVDPV excretor should prompt vaccination of close contacts with IPV. If laboratory methods permit identification of a VDPV in an environmental sample as an iVDPV in an environmental sample, public health officials should initiate a local search in the community and local health facilities. Until further information about iVDPV transmissibility is available, a decision whether to initiate a community vaccination response will depend on risk analysis of the source of the poliovirus (e.g., case vs. environment), and risk of further spread based on local force of infection, population immunity, and time since cessation. Containment breach . All PEFs should have plans for responding to a containment breach in their facilities. GAPIII (or future editions) as well as national authorities for containment (NACs) should provide clear expectations for the speed, scope, and type of activities required. Global guidelines should advise all countries with a PEF on community response in the event of a containment breach (see also Goal 1). Functional and human capacities The critical functions required for responding to a poliovirus re-emergence are based on the core generic requirements for responding to any global heath security threat.86 To ensure technical quality in implementation, polio-specific components will be needed for selected functions, time periods, and geographic areas (see Table 9). If the response to a poliovirus detection is assessed as exceeding local capacity, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) should be mobilized to coordinate international support from multiple partners. Some polio-specific capacity within multi-disciplinary response teams should be maintained at the global level within implementing agencies for at least ten years after certification. Regional capacities should mirror the global level with requirements based on national capacities, especially of high-risk countries. High-risk regions have leadership and operational responsibilities for multi-country or border outbreaks and may require sub-regional staff to support both surveillance and outbreak response. Any global roster to provide surge capacity in the event of global emergencies should include public health experts with polio response experience. 85 Tebbens RJD, Pallansch M, and Thompson KM.

Create, maintain, and manage an adequate stockpile of polio vaccine and antivirals for an appropriate response Polio vaccine stockpile Maintaining appropriately sized stockpiles of type-specific mOPV and IPV is an essential mitigation strategy for risks of outbreaks. Determining the necessary doses for each type is complicated by uncertainty around the probability and size of future outbreaks, the type of vaccine for any outbreak response after bOPV withdrawal, and the anticipated shelf life of the stored vaccine. Modeling based on analysis of type 2 outbreaks following tOPV withdrawal will be informative, but decisions on required stockpile size ultimately will depend on risk tolerance for responding to outbreaks and avoiding stock-outs. Stockpile management will need to ensure containment safeguards and provide clear decision-making for vaccine release. Antivirals Although the number of PID patients requiring PAVDs is expected to be small, creating an antiviral supply could be an important mitigation measure for an unlikely, but highly consequential risk to sustained eradication.87 Once PAVD efficacy is confirmed and protocols for their use are determined, public communication tools and management parameters will need to be developed as part of a long-term strategy to ensure global accessibility. 87 Duintjer Tebbens et al.

DOI 10.1186/s128979-015-1115-5 POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 52 Research Activities Polio-related scientific inquiry and new product development will, by necessity, continue through and beyond certification and contribute to each of the post certification goals, in addition to informing the development of relevant public health policies. The GPEI partners maintain independent but highly collaborative polio research programs. The Polio Research Committee (PRC), which includes the GPEI partners and ex-officio representatives from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) and WHO regional offices, serves as a forum to identify research needs, review current research activities, and support a competititve extramural research program. The GPEI partners and the PRC interact with an extensive network of other organizations including academic and government investigators, clinical research organizations, multinational and developing country vaccine developers, and infectious disease modelers. The polio research agenda is forward-looking, includes projects that may take years to complete, and generally does not distinguish between pre-certification and post-certification objectives. However, for planning purposes, it is useful to delineate the research requirements needed to support each of the PCS goals, recognizing there may be broad applicability across goals, for example with modeling, surveillance, and assay development. (See Figure 5 , next page) Goal 1: Contain Polio Sources Poliovirus-essential facilities (PEF) include vaccine manufacturers, public health testing facilities, and academic laboratories which maintain stocks of wild and attenuated viral material for vaccine production, vaccine quality control, and clinical assay requirements. In PEFs, the risks from inadvertent exposure or a containment breach can be reduced by replacing live polioviruses with non-replicating viral antigens or safer live viruses in laboratory protocols, reducing the need to maintain laboratory stocks of wild and attenuated viral material. Post-certification, the use of all wild and attenuated polioviruses in clinical research will be effectively prohibited unless manipulated under proper containment conditions in compliance with GAPIII requirements. These restrictions will seriously limit the use of tests essential to assess population immunity as well as immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccines and antivirals. New assays for determination of serum antibodies and for assessment of mucosal immunity that could be implemented in laboratories lacking the containment safeguards of PEFs, are in development.88 Also, if alternative polivirus strains prove to be safe to use in the community (i.e., under deliberate release) that could avoid containment requirements, they may be 88 Wright PF, Connor RI, Wieland-Alter WF, et al.

Figure 5: Polio Research and Development Goal 2: Protect Populations Protecting the global population against a re-emergence of poliomyelitis will require ongoing risk assessment, optimization of individual protection with marketed vaccines, development of new vaccines designed to reduce costs, enhance coverage, and reduce transmission of live polioviruses through induction of mucosal immunity and development of antiviral drugs to clear infection in long-term, immunodeficient iVDPV excretors. Risk assessment \u2014 Forecasting of short- and long-term risks will require development of models to predict the absolute and relative risks from WPV, cVDPV and iVDPV in all regions and over time until all credible threats to eradication are irreducible.89 Post-certification, it will be critically 89 Duintjer Tebbens RJ, Pallansch MA, Cochi SL, Wassilak SG, Thompson KM.

Periodic, targeted serological surveys in high-risk countries may be needed to better inform the models and improve risk assessment. Continued development and validation of a standardized enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for global use should improve timeliness, reduce costs, and mitigate the containment requirements of the serum neutralization assay currently required to measure antibody levels in plasma. Optimize individual protection with currently marketed IPV vaccines \u2014 SAGE recommended a two-dose IPV schedule for the post-certification period and suggested that fractional dose IPV (fIPV) is equivalent to full dose for routine immunization. However, additional clinical research is necessary to have confidence in this recommendation. Studies are underway that will provide more information on the optimal full dose and fractional dose IPV schedules for primary immunization by early 2019. These studies are complemented by operational research on delivery, feasibility, and costs associated with intradermal IPV administration. New IPV vaccine development \u2014 Projected demand and supply for IPV are shown in Figure 4 (see Goal Two). Several new IPV development programs that deploy different strategies to reduce costs (enhanced production technology, improved viral yield, antigen sparing) are in progress. Other manufacturers have started Sabin strain IPV (sIPV) development programs designed to enable developing country vaccine production.90 Several programs have recently initiated clinical trials which will extend well into the post-certification period and new IPV vaccine supplies are projected to come to market between 2019 and 2024. There are also discovery and translational phase IPV projects designed to further reduce the risks of an industrial or laboratory containment breach, including vaccines produced from genetically modified Sabin strains (NIBSC S19 strains) or virus-like particles (VLPs), and vaccines that novel adjuvants like emulsions, (TLR) agonists.91 Because the timelines for vaccines incorporating any of these approaches will extend beyond 2024, and the development costs will be great, it is uncertain whether any will be available for global use either in stand-alone or combination vaccine formulations. Enhanced IPV delivery technology \u2014 New vaccine delivery technologies have the potential to facilitate vaccine administration, reduce dose number, spare antigen, and lower cold chain requirements and storage costs, thereby facilitating both routine and campaign-based IPV immunization. Several disposable syringe jet injector devices that deliver vaccine either 90 Okayasu H, Sein C, Hamidi A, Bakker Future Has Arrived. Clin Infect 91 Norton EB, WC, Lawson LB, Clements JD.

Microarray patches (MAPs) that deliver vaccine directly into the dermis can be applied quickly and easily by minimally trained healthcare workers have the potential to reduce vaccine costs by dose sparing and to reduce shipping, storage, and cold chain costs. MAP availability could facilitate IPV delivery for both routine immunization and during campaigns for cessation or outbreak control. WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation currently support three MAP developers, but progress has been slow due to technical impediments and limited IPV bulk vaccine availability from manufacturing partners. To date, MAPs suitable for clinical study have not been produced by any of the developers and future of MAP technology for polio immunization is uncertain. Work continues on delayed-release IPV formulations that are delivered by needle and syringe (Langer) or silk protein MAP (Vaxxes), designed to reduce the number of vaccine doses required for complete immunization. These projects remain translational and are not expected to lead to marketable IPV until 2024 or later. Genetically stable new OPV \u2014mOPVs are the principal countermeasure for response to VDPV outbreaks occurring after bOPV cessation. However, mOPV use in the setting of declining humoral and mucosal immunity will carry an increasing risk of new VDPV generation and spread within and beyond the outbreak area. To mitigate this risk, Sabin-derivative OPV strains modified to increase genetic stability and reduce neurovirulence compared with the Sabin viruses are under development. Two new OPV type 2 (nOPV2) candidate strains have been manufactured for clinical study and human trials are now underway. Proof of concept is anticipated by 2019 and, if successful, nOPV2 could be available as early as 2021. New OPV1 and OPV3 strains created in the nOPV2 backbone strains are in preclinical development and may be available for human testing in 2018. To date, planning for nOPV vaccine procurement and stockpiling has not begun. Goal 3: Detect and Respond Continued research and development will be required to support post-certification surveillance and outbreak response planning, including modeling, operational research, communications and GIS technology, specimen collection for environmental surveillance, and identification and characterization of polioviruses in the field and in the laboratory. Modeling \u2014 Modeling will be needed to better understand the post-certification risks from cVDPV viruses of all 3 types and from iVDPV emergences, and how these risks will vary over time.

Ongoing modeling can assist in surveillance planning as the program adapts to changing risks over time and in different geographies. It can contribute improving site selection, sampling frequency, and other operational facets of environmental surveillance. Modeling can also inform outbreak response planning and assess the impact of new surveillance tools and new vaccines and vaccine strategies. Operational research to improve outbreak response \u2014 Operational research on outbreak response planning, campaign monitoring, and assessment includes development and deployment of new tools such as GIS mapping to improve microplans and smart phone technology to capture and transmit data and messages to and from the field. Environmental surveillance \u2014 In the absence of polio AFP cases, the world will rely on ES to detect new outbreaks, monitor persistent transmission, and confirm the disappearance of Sabin poliovirus after the withdrawal of bOPV or mOPV use.93 Improvements to environmental surveillance will require research on optimization of site selection through modeling, demography, and use of GIS technology; continued innovation of specimen collection such as the bag-mediated filtration system (BMFS), point-of-collection screening for rapid poliovirus identification, and application of deep genomic sequencing to distinguish and characterize poliovirus isolates from individual excretors in the sample population. Rapid diagnostic tests \u2014 Development of rapid diagnostic tests that do not require live polioviruses for production and can be applied in the field for quick, point-of-care (POC) testing could enhance both AFP and environmental surveillance in the future. Antiviral drugs \u2014 Persons living with inherited B cell immunodeficiency syndrome in OPV-using countries create risk to the program from persistent excretion of iVDPV viruses after OPV has stopped. In 2007, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences recommended development of at least two antiviral drugs to reduce the risk of outbreaks from immune deficient iVDPV excretors, and possibly to treat persons exposed to live polioviruses following a breach of containment at a manufacturing facility or laboratory. From a continuous discovery effort, only two compounds with promising activity and an acceptable safety profile have been identified.94 Pocapavir, a capsid inhibitor, demonstrated potent activity in human volunteers but induced excretion of resistant virus in approximately 40% of participants.95 The 3C protease inhibitor V7404 also inhibits polioviruses in vitro, but has low oral bioavailability. The current focus of the program is formulation improvement to increase the V-7404 bioavailability and to conduct Phase I safety studies with V- 7404 and with a combination of pocapavir and V-7404 (ViroD7000). Assuming successful completion of these trials, ViroD7000 may be available for distribution under named-patient protocol and further assessed for efficacy in a concurrent Phase II challenge study to begin in late 2018. However, antiviral drug development will inevitably extend into the post-certification era. Identification of iVDPV excretors \u2014 Even with availability of effective antiviral drugs, the risk from iVDPV excretors will be reduced only with effective surveillance and treatment protocols. Recent prevalence surveys found a prevalence of 1% iVDPV excretion prevalence among patients with 93 Hovi T, Shulman LM, van der Avoort H, Deshpande J, Roivainen M, EM DEG.

The objectives, scope, strategies, and operational requirements for pre- and post-eradication PID surveillance are now under active review. Other Considerations Polio-focused research and development not only requires substantial resource allocation, but because of its unique mission, needs a forum to identify knowledge gaps and research needs, and a mechanism for scientific review and translation of research data into public health and immunization policy.

Annex A POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 59 Annex B Risk Analysis The annex provides additional information and details on the risk categories that were identified in the strategy. This section does not introduce new risks that were not already addressed but goes into more technical explanation and analysis. In addtion to the amount of time since bOPV cessation, a key determinant of risk in the post- certification era, several other factors impact the likelihood of re-emergence and the severity of an outbreak. These include: virus category (transmissability and neurovirulance differ by WPV and VDPVs vs. Sabin/OPV), population characteristics (size, density, mobility, and accessibility), environmental variables (sanitation and climate), health infrastructure capacities, and the broader geopolitical context.96 Beyond familiar outbreak risk factors, the future poses new challenges amidst uncharted terrain. After eradication and bOPV cessation, population mucosal immunity will eventually be low across all ages, a situation unprecedented in recorded history. Future high birth cohort rates may translate into an exponentially increasing number of children requiring vaccination. Placing further stress on health systems, a worldwide increase in political and economic migrants who often live in urban areas without access to clean water will have significant epidemiological effects. Climate change adds to these difficulties through extreme weather conditions and rising temperatures, which not only contributes to disease spread and geographic changes in disease distribution but also produces famine and malnutrition, thereby weakening population immunity. Future outbreak risks Risk Category #1: Risks due to continued use of OPV The risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) following exposure to tOPV has been well documented, but the risk from mOPV in countries with high fecal-oral transmission of poliovirus is unknown.97 There is evidence that mOPV use can be associated with VAPP, particularly mOPV3, so the risk is expected to continue as long as any OPV is used in outbreak 96 For detailed review see Fine PEM and Ritchie S.

Epub 2015 Mar 31 Annex B POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 60 response.98 However, vaccination with IPV as proposed for routine immunization use after certification could protect against VAPP.99 Models and prior experience with vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) emergence provides imperfect though useful estimates of the future number of VDPVs. Uncertain risk factors (e.g., type-specific population immunity, population mixing and mobility, and local environmental factors influencing the propensity for fecal-oral transmission) translate into wide ranges for predicted future emergences\u2014though these ranges can be instructive for vaccine stockpile needs (see Activity 3.2.2 ) and other response strategies and requirements. The number of type 2 emergences in the first year post-tOPV withdrawal have been at the high end of what models predicted.100 The number and geographic distribution have highlighted the importance of high-quality surveillance and pre-cessation SIAs; they also demonstrate the continued susceptibility of populations in insecure or inaccessible areas. Nevertheless, the risk for type 2 cVDPVs associated with tOPV use should decline rapidly and the probability of further outbreaks by certification should be very low. However, low-quality outbreak response with mOPV2 to the type 2 cVDPV outbreaks to date could imply continued transmission of the cVDPV virus or emergence of new cVDPVs. Experience to date with type 2 can help guide estimations of future risk from types 1 and 3, though there are differences in virulence, reversion patterns, transmissibility, and secondary immunity benefits of OPV which need to be considered. Since cVDPVs were first characterized in 2000, 87% of cVDPVs detected through October 2017 have been type 2 with only 12% type 1 and 1% type 3.101 (Prior to the shift from tOPV to mOPV and bOPV for SIAs starting in 2005, the majority of VDPVs were type 1.) The historical predominance of type 2 cVDPVs may be attributed to several factors: a) differences in OPV reversion rates (OPV2>OPV1>OPV3); b) improved cVDPV surveillance accompanied by the change to a more sensitive case definition of type 2 cVDPVs than type 1 and 3 cVDPVs; and c) the lack of competition for susceptible individuals given the global eradication of WPV type 2 in 1999. While specifics surrounding future outbreaks are unknown, the risk of cVDPV 1 and 3 post-bOPV cessation should be similar to, or even smaller than, the risk for type 2 after tOPV withdrawal.102 Failure to maintain routine bOPV coverage until cessation, introduce IPV, or conduct high-quality pre-cessation SIAs in areas with low RI coverage could increase the risks of cVPDV (particularly type 1) emergences.103 iVDPV The global prevalence of B-cell related PID patients is uncertain due to variabilities in diagnosis, reporting, and survival rates. PID patients are expected to have a lower survival rate in low-income countries which tend to use OPV although recent cases have been identified. Although OPV use 98 Estivariz CE et al.

POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 61 would put these countries at the highest risk for transmission from iVDPV excretors, decreased survival of these patients reduces the risk of them surviving for long after OPV cessation. PID patients in high-income countries have much better survival rates but, as these countries stopped OPV use or are transitioning to IPV-only use, the risk for new iVDPVs is decreasing with time. The primary risk for iVDPVs and the source of most reported cases since 2005 has been from middle-income countries. A recent study from 13 OPV-using countries found 2% of PID patients were WPV excretors and 0.8% of patients with combined immunodeficiency were iVDPV excretors.104 The vast majority of OPV-infected PID patients spontaneously stop excreting in less than six months. Another summary of screening studies among PID patients reported 2.7% with poliovirus excretion and 0.1% months.105 Among the 101 iVDPV cases in the WHO global registry of iVDPV cases detected between 1962-2016, average excretion duration has been approximately one year; only 7 (7%) were chronic (e.g. >5 years) excretors. Only 8 excretors (one chronic excretor) are alive and excreting at last specimen.106 The risks for new iVDPVs should continue to decline as countries with the highest rates of PID survivability stop using OPV. Nevertheless, any iVDPV excretors could present a potential reservoir for transmission of neurovirulent poliovirus and a potential threat to sustaining polio eradication. Evidence of iVDPV transmission among family contacts or into the community is very rare and no poliomyelitis outbreaks have been attributed to iVDPV. 107,108 Experience gained from tracking cVDPV2 and iVDPV2s in the pre-certification period will be critically important in estimating the risks for emergences and transmission post-certification. Risk Category #2: Risks due to unsafe handling As explained in the context of Goal One, the likelihood of poliovirus release from a facility depends on the number of facilities handling polioviruses and the adherence of those facillities to international biorisk management standards during storage and manipulation of poliovirus- harboring materials. The potential for poliovirus released from facilities reinitiating circulation in surrounding communities will depend on the type of material released and the presence of population and environmental factors that facilitate poliovirus transmission.109,110 104 Aghamohammaid A, et al.

Community exposure through ingestion of water or food contaminated with liquid effluents will depend on the poliovirus content of facility spill, the integrity and type of sewerage system, and the potential for human consumption.111 Deliberate release of wild, vaccine- or genetically-engineered polioviruses is also possible.112 Although polioviruses are currently considered a low threat agent for a biological weapon because they cause low morbidity and mortality and are too fragile to disperse in an effective manner, the consequences of a deliberate release may be very serious with time. A small number of containment failures have been reported in the last 25 years, but only one was associated with paralytic cases. During the 1990s, WPV used for vaccine manufacturing was isolated in one child in the Netherlands and one child in France. The father of one child worked in an IPV manufacturing plant but an epidemiological link could not be identified for the second child.113 Between 2000 and 2003, a type 2 poliovirus used exclusively for IPV manufacture and quality control (MEF-1) was isolated from 9 children with AFP in India. The same type was was found in vials of a single batch of tOPV.114 In 2014, a vaccine production plant in Belgium accidentaly released into the sewage system 45 liters of vaccine concentrate containing 1013 infectious WPV type 3 particles, which subsequently discharged into rivers and the North Sea at concentrations high enough to cause infection from swimming or consuming raw shellfish for several days.115 Finally in 2016, a worker was infected following an accidental spillage in a Dutch vaccine manufacturing plant.116 A modeling analysis found that a poliovirus release from vaccine production sites into countries with high transmission risk several years after OPV cessation could result in uncontrollable transmission that would require OPV restart.117 This stituation was found in one out of 100 iterations of the model, whereas introduction of VDPV1 by a long-term PID excretor caused the other iteration associated with an uncontrollable outbreak. Risk Category #3: Risk due to undetected transmission The last detected case of WPV2 was in 1999 and in September 2015, the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (GCC) confirmed that wild type 2 poliovirus has been globally eradicated. In July 2017, the GCC noted that modeling suggests that, in the presence of high-quality AFP surveillance and high population immunity, a period of three years without 111 See Dowdle W, van der Avoort H, de Gourville E, et al. 112 Cello J, Paul AV, Wimmer E.

After five years without detecting cases the probability of undetected transmission drops to 0.1-1%.119 118 GCC. Report from the Sixteen Meeting, Paris, France, 4-5 July 2017.

Am J Epidemiol. 1996 Apr 15;143(8):816-22 POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 64 Annex C Country Risk Classification In the post-certification era, a risk-based surveillance approach is recommended to maintain a polio-free world. Classification of a country's risk is based on the three risk categories: (1) continued OPV use; (2) unsafe handling of polioviruses; and (3) undetected transmission. Shedding of immunodeficiency-associated vaccine-derived poliovirus (iVDPV) among primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) patients may also result from continued OPV use; this is not addressed in the classification scheme. Further research is needed to better understand the prevalence of PID and transmissibility of iVDPV, as well as to identify effective surveillance strategies for detection. These findings and recommendations will be published in a future version of the PCS plan. Finally, development of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) is a risk of continued OPV use but is not addressed in the classification scheme. Ambiguous vaccine-derived polioviruses (aVDPV) also pose a potential threat to a polio-free world after certification. The origin and properties of aVDPVs are unclear but are believed to be closer to cVDPV than to Sabin viruses. aVDPVs may die out spontaneously or may be the first indication of a cVDPV outbreak and due to this uncertainty, aVDPVs are treated as cVDPVs for country risk classification purposes. Rationale for Risk Classification Criteria 1. Continued OPV use: The risks associated with continued OPV use are further classified to address type-specific difference in OPV use. Emergence of cVDPV1 or 3 (bOPV use in routine immunization): Factors included as part of the classification criteria are bOPV use, vaccine coverage, and country income-level. Only bOPV use in routine immunization is a consideration due to the absence of tOPV and mOPV1 or 3 use. Vaccine coverage and country income-level are used to roughly estimate population immunity. Vaccination coverage alone is inadequate because effectiveness of OPVs can be reduced depending on country circumstances. Country-income level (surrogate for health and sanitation infrastructure) is used to account for these country-specific factors. Emergence of cVDPV2 (mOPV2 use for outbreak response): mOPV2 use and IPV coverage are factors used in the classification criteria. mOPV2 is the only Type 2 containing OPV that will be used prior to certification. Although the overall risk of cVDPV2 at the time of certification will be low, the risk will be higher in countries that Annex C POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 65 used mOPV2 for outbreak response. IPV coverage is used as a proxy for population immunity to Type 2. 2. Unsafe handling of polioviruses: Any country with a polio-essential facility (PEF) will be at risk of an unintentional release of poliovirus. The country risk classification criteria are based on factors that increase the risk of transmission following release which are (a) amount of virus released and (b) population vulnerability. a. Amount of virus released: Vaccine manufacturing PEFs will have higher volumes and concentrations of poliovirus in materials than laboratory PEFs. b. Population vulnerability: High IPV coverage in a country with a vaccine manufacturing PEF can protect vaccinated individuals from paralysis and mitigate the risk of transmission from a release in areas where oropharyngeal transmission predominates. Furthermore, country income-level is used as a proxy for health and sanitation infrastructure, which are linked to routes of transmission and transmissibility. Categories of virus (WPVs, VDPVs, Sabin viruses) were not distinguished because release of any poliovirus poses a serious threat even though transmissibility differs by category. Intentional release of poliovirus is not addressed because of its unpredictability. 3. Undetected transmission: Continued circulation of a previously identified cVDPV is of concern because it is unknown when extinction of the virus occurs. Modeling results of cVDPV type 2 suggests extinction occurs if it has not been detected within three years of last detection.120 The time periods used for each risk group reflects a cautious interpretation of modeling results including extrapolation to cVDPV types 1 and 3. Final Determination of Country Risk Classification The categories and criteria for risk classification for poliovirus re-introduction are summarized in Table 10. A country should assess each of the risk categories independently as it may be high risk for one risk category and low risk for another. A single high-risk determination leads to a preliminary classification as a high-risk country. In the absence of any high risk, a single medium risk determination leads to a preliminary medium risk classification. In the absence of any high or medium risk, a country is preliminarily classified as low risk. Final determination and classification of country risk will be completed in collaboration with WHO Regional Offices. In some large countries, the preliminary assessment may apply to only certain provinces or geographic areas (usually population blocks of at least 10 million). Countries also need to consider the risks posed by bordering countries. This multinational approach is intended to ensure continuity of surveillance activities across high-risk border areas (e.g., Lake Chad). 120 Kalkowska DA, et al.

Doi 10.1186/s12879-015-0791-5. POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 66 Surveillance Strategies Countries should adopt a mix of strategies appropriate for their corresponding finalized country risk classification that is reflective of the changing potential re-emergence of poliovirus post- certification (See Table 6 in PCS Plan and Figure 2) . This will efficiently address the varying risks across all risk categories and avoid the complexities associated with changing surveillance strategies over a short period of time. Poliovirus Outbreaks Poliovirus outbreaks outside of high-risk countries will immediately lead to re-classification of the country as high-risk, which will require changes to its long-term surveillance strategies and activities. This will also necessitate WHO Regional Office consultation to determine if re- classification of neighboring countries will be needed. The use of mOPV as part of outbreak response activities will necessitate high-risk surveillance strategies (e.g., active surveillance) to continue for at least two years after last mOPV2 use to detect any emergence of VDPVs. Country Risk Classification over Time Prior to certification, all countries should assess their future risk for the re-introduction of poliovirus using the most current version of the Post-Certification Strategic (PCS) plan. After certification, the PCS plan is anticipated to be updated prior to each post-certification stage (See Table 6 of the PCS plan). This presents an opportunity to re-assess and re-tool the country risk classification criteria. Countries are expected to re-evaluate their risks using the updated risk classification criteria, potentially resulting in a move from one risk classification category to another. This is expected and countries need to ensure their surveillance strategies are appropriate for their new risk classification. Of note, a number of the criteria used for the country risk classification are based on time since an important milestone. For example, Table 10 is based on time since certification. With subsequent updates of the PCS plan, other milestones will be used such as bOPV cessation.

Such indicator-based surveillance (IBS) is often a combination of clinical/syndromic or laboratory-based diagnosis. (AFP surveillance is an example.) Although standardized IBS approaches for both global121 and regional levels (e.g., Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response in Africa122) have been proposed, case definitions and implementation can vary widely. Reporting is usually aggregated at local levels and forwarded to national levels weekly or monthly. Routine surveillance systems also usually mandate immediate notification of certain diseases or syndromes (including AFP), however these systems are usually deemed inadequate for use in an eradication program due to the high variability in completeness, timeliness, validity, and reliability of data. Many countries have supplemented the passive health information systems with parallel active AFP surveillance networks through assistance from GPEI. There are several other 'vertical' surveillance systems that have either direct or indirect relevance to future poliovirus surveillance. Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (VPDs). In addition to AFP surveillance for polio, there are other global/national systems to track VPDs which are outbreak-prone and/or have specific control/elimination targets (e.g., measles/rubella, Japanese encephalitis, maternal-neonatal tetanus, yellow fever). These other systems also utilize IBS with a combination of clinical and syndromic or laboratory-based diagnoses; however, none have yet fully implemented the same extensive active, case-based surveillance system central to AFP surveillance. Measles/rubella surveillance is moving towards a case-based approach for all countries that relies on a comprehensive global diagnostic laboratory network similar to the GPLN. However, several areas that still have a high incidence of measles (e.g., India, parts of Africa, etc.) continue to rely on clinical diagnosis or epidemiologically linked cases to identify clusters of measles/rubella cases. Other common VPDs such as invasive bacterial diseases (e.g., meningitis), rotavirus, and influenza, depend heavily upon sentinel site surveillance to track disease trends or monitor program impact. Polio eradication efforts are also unique among programs aimed at VPDs in their extensive use of ES. High-threat pathogens . Surveillance for \"high-threat pathogens\" (i.e., highly infectious agents that produce severe disease such as viral hemorrhagic fevers, meningitis, cholera, Zika, etc.) utilizes a mix of surveillance strategies based on risk level in order to achieve program objectives to 121 WHO Recommended Surveillance Standard, 2nd ed. Geneva, WHO; 1999. 122 Technical Guidelines for Integrated Disease Surveillance response in the African Region, 2nd ed. Brazzaville, Atlanta: Who Regional Office for Africa, CDC; (2010) Annex D POST-CERTIFICATION STRATEGY DRAFT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION INITIATIVE 69 control or eliminate epidemics. Case-based surveillance reporting from health facilities is generally used in high-risk countries and a sentinel surveillance approach in moderate-risk countries. Low-risk countries tend to have more developed health systems and can rely on routine surveillance but may develop targeted systems if an unusal threat arises in a particular sub- national area. Surveillance is usually syndromic with highly variable capacities for laboratory diagnosis. The primary objective of surveillance for relatively rare diseases with high mortality and/or high potential risk for outbreaks (e.g., Ebola) is to provide immediate detection and reporting of even suspected cases. However, even for these diseases, the focus is on passive reporting from district or tertiary health care facilities except during outbreaks when more active approaches are implemented. Enteroviruses . Enterovirus surveillance has been used as a supplementary or alternative surveillance system to AFP, especially in countries which either never developed more targeted poliovirus surveillance or found it difficult to sustain the expected AFP quality indicators over time. Enterovirus surveillance is commonly utilized in Europe to passively detect outbreaks, establish disease burden, or conduct virological research for a wide variety of syndromes, including paralysis, febrile-rash, respiratory infections, aseptic meningitis, gastroenteritis, etc which may be caused by a wide variety of causative agents.123 At clinician discretion, laboratories collect and process stool, respiratory or cerebral spinal fluid specimens. In the United States, the National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS) is a passive, voluntary surveillance system that monitors sentinel-site laboratory detections of enteroviruses and human parechoviruses. A cluster of suspicious EV cases, such as acute flaccid myelitis, may prompt more active case investigation and enhanced surveillance.124 Community-based surveillance (CBS). Community informants or village based volunteers have been used in many countries as informal sources of information on AFP cases. On a wider scale, CBS can be a useful source of Event Based Surveillance (EBS) to track disease trends or identify unusual health events at the local level by detecting clusters of people with similar signs and symptoms. However, the scope, reliability, and sustainability of these systems vary widely. In Indonesia, for example, CBS has been used for many years to regularly provide supplemental inputs to the national health information system. A less structured approach relies on \"community informants\" in each village to periodically text health events to district health workers, but this system has often been difficult to sustain. A more time-limited form of CBS has been used in several countries that are in the midst of disease outbreaks, recovering from recent natural disasters, or are undergoing complex disruptions of their security. In several recent disasters, the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) has established an organized system of trained local health \"volunteers\" who are usually paid a small stipend to monitor trends and detect clusters of various syndromes, including paralysis, in their districts through regular interviews of village leaders.125 While inputs from CBS may not be very specific, they can enhance the sensitivity of communicable disease surveillance and provide more community ownership of their health system. 123 CDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe.
