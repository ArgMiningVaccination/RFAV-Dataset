We find that several wild varieties ofthebovine tribe were originally widely disseminated inAsiaandEurope. From ancient writings and pictures welearn that these wild cattle were frequently theobjects reduced todomesticity, andbyconfinement andcare lost their wild instincts. Ultimately these captive animals became fully domesticated, and astheherds increased, andwere driven from place topJacemsearch characteristics andofhumanity's upward progress from savagery tocivilization finds abundant evidence ofthefact thatdomestic animals were amost which were easily domesticable have gone hand inhanddown through thecenturies.

Still, within lasttwo centuries thatany careful, systematic breeding hasbeen attempted, andonly within thelastseventy-five years have greater results been accomplished andthegreatest progress toward perfection beenmade.

Statistics show that foraperiod extending over fiftyyears from 1850 to 1900 thenumber ofcattle received anaccession cent, during this decade, other cattle show aloss of2,381,184. The total value ofall cattle increased during this period only because ofthegreater number and increased valuation of,milch cows, their gain approximating $196,000,000.
