With over 900 members, we are America's largest me mbership organization of law faculty. We have an ambitious , change- oriented agenda and as an All Volunteer Non-Profit Organization, CLEA proudly relies on each of you and the wonderfu l work you do. In this message, I report on the recent CLEA elect ions, CLEA advocacy on the ABA's review of Accreditation Standards, and several ongoing and upcoming projects. The act ivities noted reflect the hard work of so many people and the exe mplary lead- ership of our Immediate Past President, Bob Kuehn (Washington University Law School) . Bob's contributions and strengths are too numerous to list here but I think they are quit e well known to most of you. If he were only the go-to guy on poli tical interfer- ence, that would be such a huge contribution in and of itself; but he has done and does so much more. He leaves very big shoes for my rather compact feet. Elections, Officers and Board Members Binny Miller (American University Washington Colleg e of Law), Chair of the Elections Committee and Kate Kruse (University of Nevada, Las Vegas Law School) , CLEA Secre- tary , worked hard and conducted our annual elections in the fall. These people took office as CLEA Officers, members of the Executive Committee for 2011 and continue their ser vice on the Board: Ian Weinstein (Fordham Law School) - President Bob Kuehn (Washington University School of Law) - Imme-PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Inside this issue: Committee Reports 4 Conferences 6 New Clinicians 12 Transitions 15 Promotions, Honors & Awards 17 News from Clinical Pro- grams 21 Books & Publications 60 Job Announcements 69 CLEA Newsletter FEBRUARY, 2011 Volume XIX No. 2 CLINICAL LEGAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION EDITOR Larry R.

This is an important issue that is receiving attention from a special committee of Binny Miller (American) , Esther Canty-Barnes (Rutgers Newark School of Law) and Kele Stewart (Miami) , as well as both our Elections Committee and the Governance Review Committee. I a m committed to coordinating the work of these groups and moving forward toward a mo re effective strategy to diversify our leadership and board. ABA Advocacy Since the last President's message in September, w e have continued our advocacy work on the ABA Accreditation Standards. Several CLEA officers attended the Standards Review Committee meeting in St. Louis, including Claudia Angelos (NYU) , who has at- tended virtually all the SRC meetings during this r eview process. We were also repre- sented at the Standards Review Committee meeting in San Francisco and at the November meeting of the Council of the ABA Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar in San Diego. CLEA submitted comments on the developi ng draft standards during the fall and winter. Our comments and other documents are p osted on the SRC site at: http:// www.abanet.org/legaled/committees/comstandards.html . The Standards Review Committee has worked through its proposal on Outcome Measures, an issue on which CLEA has been a leader for some time. Although the provi- sions are less ambitious than we would have liked, as we argued in this comment, http:// www.abanet.org/legaled/committees/Standards%20Revie w%20documents/ Outcome%20Measurements/CLEA%20outcomes%20comment%20 July%202010.pdf , 3 the proposal, standing alone, is a step in the righ t direction. As the process continues to unfold, an important question will be how this vers ion of Outcome Measures fits together with the rest of the proposed changes to the Accred itation Standards. As the AALS has so powerfully argued in its submissions, the whole sys tem of regulation must be considered to understand the impact of any one change or set o f changes. The Standards Review Committee has begun to grappl e with the very important is- sue of Security of Position. CLEA is strongly comm itted to preserving structures that can effectively guarantee academic freedom and particip ation in governance, as we argued in this submission, http://www.abanet.org/legaled/committees/Standards% 20Review% 20documents/Comment%20-%20Security%20of%20Position% 20-%20CLEA,% 20December%202010.pdf and our earlier comments. Our community knows abou t the weaknesses in our current system and is particularl y well placed to explain the very real damage that will flow from weakening current provis ions for security of position. These and other important issues will be discussed at the Standards Review Committee meeting in Chicago on April 2 and 3. There will be a publi c forum on the morning of Saturday, April 2, and I urge you to attend if at all possibl e. Not everyone is likely to get a chance to speak, but it is important that the Standards Revie w Committee see our deep and thoughtful concern about these issues. CLEA continues to work closely with our colleagues at SALT, with leaders in the Le- gal Writing and Library communities, the AALS Execu tive and Clinical Section leadership, within the ABA, and in state bar groups. There ha s also been fruitful organizing of facul- ties around the country and I urge each of you to o rganize your colleagues and make your views known to the ABA. Membership Our membership grew last year, thanks to the hard work of the Membership Com- mittee and Bob Kuehn . Maintaining and growing our membership is essent ial. Please make sure your membership is current and encourage all your colleagues to join. Cur- rent memberships will expire in June. Your members hip and the membership of each and every one of your colleagues make a difference. Best Practices CLEA's Best Practices Implementation Committee hel d a very successful one-day conference in San Francisco. I am very excited abo ut their multi-prong plan to expand the reach of Best Practices by spreading the word and d eveloping new substantive areas. They are beginning discussions about a new edition of th e Best Practice for Legal Education book and will be soliciting input soon. New Clinicians Conference CLEA will be holding a New Clinicians Conference i n Seattle in June. Our New Cli- nicians Conference is one of CLEA's signature initi atives and the collaboration of many tal- ented people is needed to make it happen. We also have an active Governance Review project, our support for the Clinical Law 4 Review continues, our Awards Committee hums along, and we are working to continue to improve our website. This is a time of ferment in American legal educati on. There are opportunities and tre- mendous challenges. And if we all work together, w e can continue to make a difference for our students, our clients, and our schools. ~Ian Weinstein Fordham Law School CLEA President iweinstein@law.fordham.edu Committee Reports AALS Section on Clinical Legal Education Awards Co mmittee Christine Zuni Cruz (New Mexico) Receives William P incus Award Christine Zuni Cruz , Professor of Law at the University of New Mexico School of Law, and currently co-Director of the Southwest Ind ian Law Clinic received the 2010 Wil- liam Pincus Award and was recognized on January 8, 2011 during the Se ction of Clinical Legal Education Luncheon and Program during the AAL S 2011 Annual Meeting in San Francisco.

CONFERENCES AALS Conference on Clinical Legal Education June 13-16, 2011 Seattle, Washington This year our clinical conference this year will t ake place over four days in mid- June, as part of the AALS mid-year meeting. We wil l spend the first two days of the con- ference (June 13 and 14) with non-clinical faculty and deans in a joint curriculum and clinical conference designed to give us an opportun ity to interact and exchange ideas about ways to improve the law school curriculum. D uring this phase of the conference we will use plenary sessions and facilitated small gro ups to examine five topics: what are the 7 core values of a 21 st century legal education; how can we understand and teach about practicing law across borders and cultures; how can we use experiential learning to enrich the curriculum; how can we prepare students to be r eady for the profession; and how can we achieve institutional change. The sessions will be designed to explore both competen- cies (e.g., critical thinking, problem solving, pro fessional judgment) and methods for achieving them (e.g., opportunities for students to merge doctrine, skills, and professional identity, to deal with situations in which client p roblems, facts, legal rules, and ethical principles are fluid and ill-defined, and to see ho w law and theory function in practice). An overall goal of this part of the conference is to i dentify and explore how to achieve the cur- ricular changes that will promote learning for tran sfer - learning that will maximize stu- dents' ability to function as effective and ethical professionals in unfamiliar settings and under circumstances that we cannot now predict. Throughout these first days of the conference, the plenary presentations and small group discussions will take place against the backd rop of an ongoing role-play of a law school curriculum committee (faux faculty committee ). This committee will be consulting regularly with its faculty (i.e., the conference pa rticipants), and will be discussing and as- sessing the ideas put forward at the conference, mo deling faculty decision-making proc- esses, and ultimately presenting a curriculum propo sal for the attendees to consider. All presentations and small group discussions, includin g the meetings and presentations of the \"curriculum committee,\" will include a mix of c linical and non-clinical perspectives. We will spend the next two days of the conference (June 15 and 16) on our own as clinical faculty, reflecting on what we learned dur ing the first two days, and drilling down into one of the core components of clinical legal e ducation: problem solving. Through ple- nary sessions, concurrent sessions, and small group meetings, we will examine four areas of problem-solving: (1) understanding the content and context of legal problems; (2) diag- nosing or defining legal problems; (3) making decis ions in the context of developing client- centered solutions; and finally, (4) integrating wh at students have learned in law school and transferring that learning into practice.

FROM CLINICAL PROGRAMS The students in the Securities Arbitration Clinic initiated two arbitrations last term. They conducted client interviews and extensi ve investigation. Their work culmi- nated in the filing of an action which is currently in the discovery phase. The students working on the second case are preparing a mediatio n submission and negotiation plan in anticipation of their scheduled mediation. Additio nally, all of the students will be present- ing \"What Your Broker Knows and You Don't: Securiti es for Seniors\" at Albany Law School's Senior Law Day and again to an audience of approximately one hundred seniors 22 at a meeting of the Albany Guardian Society. The Civil Rights and Disability Law Clinic won a major victory in gaining access to consumer records in two New York institutions. The NYS OMRDD had denied the clinic access to consumer records for those individuals wh o had actively involved family mem- bers that could give the clinic permission to view those records. With its decision the Third Department Appellate Division granted the cli nic access to records of consumers who were unable to consent or have actively involve d family members who are not legal guardians, conservators or legal representatives. The decision is In the Matter of Albany Law School et al. v. New York State Office of Menta l Retardation and Developmental Disabili- ties, et al., available at http://decisions.courts.state.ny.us/ad3/ Decisions/2011/510422.pdf .

With the very positive impact such a curriculum can have, the TCP is continuing the \"Kids and Cam- eras\" program, which is taught by a CFCC Student Fe llow, and another Student Fellow will be actively involved in a new \" Kids and Theat er\" pilot program. The offerings are being met with great enthusiasm by schools, especially wh en fiscal issues mean a dearth of such opportunities for children. ( Photos of last semest er's Kids and Cameras exhibit are avail- able on CFCC's website). CFCC's blog continues to attract new readers, with many student contributions and comments. All are welcome to join the conversation at http://ub-cfcc.blogspot.com/ <http://ub-cfcc.blogspot.com/ > For further information about CFCC and any of its initiatives, or if you would like to receive the UFC Connection, please contact Professo r Barbara A.

At the ECDC, third year law students will obtain hands on experi ence representing local small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs on transactional legal issues critical to their success. Before its opening, the ECDC had a long list of cli ents awaiting its services. The ECDC is a transactional law clinic in which st udents provide legal assistance on issues confronting small businesses in the Cincinna ti area. Such assistance includes helping clients determine what type of entity to es tablish, and assisting clients in estab- lishing that entity; preparing, reviewing, and nego tiating contracts and leases; helping them obtain necessary licenses and permits, and mee ting other regulations that impact the business; providing trademark or copyright advi ce; and addressing additional legal is- sues as they arise. Businesses can become involved with the clinic thr ough its application process, which involves completing a questionnaire about the business, its legal needs, and its fi- nancial situation. New businesses complete a busin ess plan showing the business' com- mitment to its mission and its likelihood of succes s prior to acceptance as a clinic client. The inaugural class consists of six third-year law students. The clinic is located within the law school and receives administrative support from the College of Law's Lori Strait. 26 The College of Law was fortunate to hire Professor Lew Goldfarb to develop the clinic and supervise students who are accepted for clinic enrollment. Attend- ing the Ohio State University for both undergraduat e and law school, Prof. Goldfarb had several careers before coming to UC's College of Law. He worked as a CPA before attending law school. Following L aw School graduation Prof. Goldfarb worked at Baker & Hostetler in the firm's business section. Next, he provided transactional legal services to Honda of America fo r 16 years as its Associate Chief Coun- sel; and then became an entrepreneur, developing an d operating an Ohio tutoring com- pany. Prof. Goldfarb comes to UC following a visito rship at Lewis & Clark's Law School to teach its small business clinic and, subsequently, a visiting position at Wayne State Law School to direct and teach its small business clini c. Last year, following a national search, Professor Goldfarb was hired by the University of C incinnati College of Law. The College is very fortunate to have Professor Goldfarb as a memb er of its faculty. New Environmental Practice Law Clinic and Energy La w Center In the fall of 2010, the University of Connecticut School of Law created a new Cen- ter for Energy and Environmental Law (\"CEEL\" ), funded partially through a federal grant received from the United States Department of Education. Lynn Fountain , previously an energy attorney with Day Pitney LLP , has joined UConn Law to serve as Executive Director of CEE L and as an Assistant Clinical Profes- sor of Law . Alan Kosloff , currently of counsel with Levy & Droney, P.C., wa s hired to di- rect a new Environmental Practice Clinic (the \"Clin ic\"), jointly sponsored by the campus-based Connecticut Urban Legal Initiative , Inc. and CEEL. One of CEEL's goals is to expand the School of Law' s energy and environmental law cur- riculum, including providing additional experientia l opportunities such as clinics and ex- ternships. In addition to the new Clinic, describe d below, CEEL has added several new energy courses and has coordinated four energy-rela ted externships for the fall and spring 27 semesters. Among its various clients, the new Environmental P ractice Clinic is currently repre- senting the City of Bristol on brownfields projects key to the City's redevelopment strate- gies. It is also representing the City of Waterbur y in connection with its widely acclaimed Naugatuck River Greenway project. These matters ar e producing wonderful learning op- portunities for our students. The students' casewo rk is enriched by weekly seminars ex- ploring issues that are essential to the knowledge base of environmental practitioners. UNIVERSITY OF DENVER STURM COLLEGE OF LAW The new Community Economic Development (CED) Clinic will begin representing clients in Fall 2011. Until then, Eric Franklin , Whiting Clinical Teaching Fellow joins Pro- fessor Patience Crowder in developing the clinic's design and meeting with members of the Denver community to form partnerships and culti vate relationships with potential cli- ents. This leads to our second piece of wonderful news. The CED clinic is a very proud recipient of a $7,500 grant from Colorado State Ban k and Trust. This grant will be instru- mental in facilitating the clinic's goal of assisti ng Denver's underserved communties, par- ticularly clients seeking assistance with small bus iness operations, neighborhood stablili- zation and community development. Criminal Defense Clinic Co-teaching the newly-renamed Criminal Defense Cli nic with longtime Professor Howard Rosenberg , Professors Christopher Lasch and Robin Walker Sterling are revis- ing the criminal clinic's curriculum in new and exc iting ways. For example, last semester saw a revamped syllabus, with an emphasis on skills training and on-your-feet exercises, as well as intensive feedback. Ten of the twelve s tudents in the clinic either had a jury trial (in Colorado, misdemeanors and municipal offe nses are jury triable), or a contested evidentiary hearing. The students won acquittals o n at least one count in all but one of the jury trials. Six of the seven students in the clinic last semester who applied to work at the highly-regarded Colorado Public Defender's Offi ce have received offers. The spring semester saw the institution of a new t wo-week long extended orienta- tion, during which the clinic students worked throu gh an entire simulated misdemeanor case written by Prof. Lasch. The focus of the inten sive orientation was skills practice and individualized feedback. Each student did a simulat ed arraignment, bail argument, discov- ery argument, suppression hearing, and sentencing a rgument, with actors from the Uni- versity of Denver Theatre Department playing the ro les of the client and suppression hear- ing witnesses. Each student also received individu alized feedback, which the student was expected to incorporate into the next day's simulat ion. The orientation was well-received, and the students are off to a great start. Matt Sp ivey, a third-year student, wrote in his reflection paper on the clinic blog (another innova tion), \"I spent this last summer and the 28 fall semester interning with the Arapahoe Public De fender's Office and in 2 weeks I re- ceived more feedback on my arguments and 'court dem eanor' than I did the entire intern- ship with the PD's office.\" Aaron Thompson, a secon d-year student, summed up the orien- tation as a \"wonderful\" and rigorous experience in which he had \"learned a lot about the process of being an advocate and about the ethical and professional duties that our clients should expect from us.\" Other innovations will cert ainly follow.

The NJIDV is a partnership of th e U.S. Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women, the National Council of Juv enile and Family Court Judges, and the Family Violence Prevention Fund. At UDC-David A. Clarke School of Law, our clinical program is an integral part of the core educational curriculum. We require that st udents, both full and part-time, suc- cessfully complete two seven-credit hour clinics in order to graduate. In addition to striv- ing to provide opportunities across a spectrum of p ractice areas, we have historically linked the clinic curriculum to overall curricular objectives. Although we are a small school of approximately 340 students, we offer eigh t clinics. Embedding Librarians in Clinic Our most recent innovation involves embedding libra rians in clinics to teach legal research as a lawyering skill, complete with ethica l responsibilities and professional stan- dards. In a recently completed article, Vicen\u00e7 Fe li\u00fa, Assistant Professor of Law and Direc- tor of the Law Library, and Helen Frazer, Associate Director of the Law Library , examine how embedding librarians in practice settings to of fer assistance at the point of need could be effective in law school clinics. Embedded Librarians: Teaching Legal Research as a Lawyering Skill , accepted for publication in the Journal of Legal Education Took Crowell Institute for At-Risk Youth In November 2010 Crowell & Moring LLP and the UDC David A. Clarke School of Law launched the Took Crowell Institute for At-Risk Youth. The Institute builds on the ad- vocacy and law reform work already underway at the law school's Juvenile and Special Education Law Clinic to help at-risk youth become e ducated and productive members of society. For the past twenty years, Clinic faculty and law students have been using educa- tional advocacy to extricate children from the deli nquency system and get those children back into school. This pioneering program for reve rsing the school-to-prison pipeline meets a critical need in the District of Columbia a nd is a model for children's advocates around the country. With support from Crowell & Mo ring, the Juvenile and Special Edu- cation Law Clinic is adding two supervising attorne ys. With this added capacity, the Clinic will expand and sharpen its focus to include school discipline cases and Medicaid advo- cacy. In addition, the Clinic will do more direct delinquency defense work, training law students to become lawyers who will address every a spect of the school-to-prison pipeline and who will be able to provide comprehensive repre sentation for children. The Institute was made possible through a generous grant over six years from Cro- well & Moring in memory of Eldon \"Took\" Crowell, th e firm's first chairman and long-time leader who passed away in May. 30 HIV-AIDS Legal Clinic Victory Brings Systemic Chang e to D.C.'s Abuse and Neglect System The HIV-AIDS Legal Clinic represents parents and c aregivers in planning for the fu- ture care of children, often in the transfer of chi ldren from an ill parent to another family member or friend. The Clinic also works to prevent the unnecessary break-up of families who come before child protection agencies, or reuni te separated families. In the D.C. Court of Appeals, several student atto rneys recently garnered a sensa- tional victory on behalf of a father challenging te rmination of his parental rights to his three daughters, and their subsequent adoption by a stranger. The students argued that on the basis of relevant legal authority, this fath er was entitled to a trial by an Associate Judge, rather than a Magistrate Judge. Agreeing wi th the students' interpretation of the legal authority and acknowledging that parents migh t have valid reasons for requesting an Associate Judge and not a Magistrate Judge, the Cou rt of Appeals took a rare step and re- versed and remanded the adoption. This decision ha s shaken D.C.'s abuse and neglect system to its core, as many emboldened parents' att orneys seek similar redress for their clients. The saga continues, however, because the Family Court of D.C. Superior Court now proposes a rule change to undo this choice of j udge currently afforded parents under the law. http://www.dcappeals.gov/dccourts/appeals/pdf/09-FS -994+_MTD.PDF . Professor LaShanda Taylor addresses a related issue raised by termination of pa- rental rights in her article Resurrecting Parents of Legal Orphans: Un-Terminati ng Parental Rights , 17 Va . J. Soc . Pol'y & L. 318 (2010). The article examines the re cognized need for more uniform solutions to the problems created when a child loses legal rights to his or her biological parents without those rights being r eplaced through adoption. After recount- ing both state and individual initiatives, Professo r Taylor proposes that states enact legis- lation providing for a temporary termination of par ental rights order entered after a bifur- cated hearing on the parent's fitness and the child 's best interests. Tanya Asim Cooper , LL.M. candidate/Supervising Attorney, recently co mpleted an article on the secondary harm that prosecutors ofte n inflict on child witnesses. The solu- tion, Ms. Cooper argues, is to recognize the inhere nt conflict of interest that prosecutors encounter in protecting child witness rights, and t o appoint independent counsel for the child to champion those rights. Sacrificing the Child to Convict the Defendant: Sec ondary Traumatization of Child Witnesses by Prosecutors, t heir Inherent Conflict of Interest, and the Need for Child Witness Counsel will appear in the spring 2011 issue of the Cardozo Public Law, Policy, and Ethics Journal. Immigration and International Human Rights Clinic W ins Three Cases Since Opening its Doors This Past August Student attorneys worked under the supervision of Kristina Campbell , Clinic Direc- tor and Maunica Sthanki , LL.M. candidate/Supervising Attorney. The first case was a BIA (Bureau of Immigration Ap peal) appeal. Student attorneys did an amazing job developing a complex legal argum ent in a short amount of time. Our client has been a legal permanent resident for 31 y ears, has a U.S. Citizen wife and seven U.S. Citizen children. He has since been released f rom custody after three years of deten- tion and reunited with his family. Our second victory involved an Iraqi refugee in re moval proceedings following several convictions for assault and battery in Virginia. St udent attorneys filed a Motion to Termi- nate our client's removal proceedings based on the argument that his convictions were 31 categorically not Crimes Involving Moral Turpitude. In response to our students' brief, the government filed a Motion to Dismiss. Our client ha s since been released from detention and has also been reunited with his wife and three children. Our third victory involved Mr. H, originally from Jamaica, who has lived in the United States for over thirteen years. He has a Un ited States Citizen child and a United States Citizen life partner. He was detained in th e York County Prison in York, Pennsyl- vania for several months while attempting to fight removal from the United States. Mr. H was ordered removed to Jamaica after appearing befo re an immigration judge without legal counsel. Student attorneys represented Mr. H at th e appellate level and argued that the Immigration Judge's decision was clearly erroneous and not supported by the evidentiary record. The BIA fully agreed with students' analys is and ruled in our client's favor. As a result of this victory, Mr. H. will get another opp ortunity to apply for relief from removal before an immigration judge. Two third-year students, Lindsey Austin ('11) and L indsay Silverblatt ('11), worked with attorneys from the Immigrant Defense Project a nd Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem to update the Immigrant Defense Project 's Practice Advisory: Recent Develop- ments in the Categorical Approach: Tips for Crimina l Defense Lawyers Representing Immi- grant Clients . The advisory will be included in a practice manua l for criminal defense attor- neys in New York and distributed to immigration and criminal advocates across the coun- try. SCHOOL OF LAW Unemployment Compensation Clinic Our Law School's Unemployment Compensation Clinic i s up and running for the 2010-2011 academic year. There are currently six ( 6) students enrolled in this clinical program and as of the third week in October, the Cl inic has already handled twenty-eight (28) cases and the students are all busy interviewi ng clients preparing for and attending hearings and representing their clients to the best of their abilities. The Clinic recently accepted a case in the Commonw ealth Court, which involved an instance of off-duty misconduct and whether or not the facts supported a disqualification of the client for benefits under both Section 3 as well as 402(e) of the law. Also at issue in this case is a UPMC policy which established, as a basis for discharge from employment, when a staff member is charged with and not found i nnocent of a crime, which would di- minish trust in the staff member's future performan ce. Additionally, as a class project, the students are writing a script and will be taping a \"mock hearing\", to be used as a training tool for future unemployment clinic classes. New on board at the clinic this year, as an additi onal supervising attorney, is Daniel Kunz, Esquire. Dan will assist and mentor the students in connection with their unem- 32 ployment hearings and he has been very well receive d. Dan is a solo practitioner, and is also a clerk to several senior Common Pleas Orphans ' Court Division Judges. Additionally, this year brings back Lori Buntman , as the Unemployment Compen- sation Clinic Manager. Lori set a new world record last year by handling in excess of thirty (30) cases at the Unemployment Compensation Clinic. This year her role is working inten- sively with our six (6) students, assisting them in client interviews and in all phases of case preparation. Because of her extensive experie nce in this field, Lori has been working part-time, in addition to her studies, as a hearing consultant to an employer service firm assisting them with their unemployment compensation hearings. On May 19, 2010 the Unemployment Compensation Clini c was presented with the Pennsylvania Bar Association's 2010 PBA Pro Bono Aw ard for its outstanding commit- ment providing legal services to the poor. ELON UNIVERSTY SCHOOL OF LAW Humanitarian Immigration Law Clinic Elon University School of Law has established the Humanitarian Immigration Law Clinic, allowing students under the supervision of law faculty to provide free legal services to low-income refugees and asylum seekers in North Carolina. The clinic begins operations in January 2011 and w ill be the third clinic operated by Elon's law school. The Humanitarian Immigration Law Clinic will fill an urgent need in the Triad region, which receives more than a quarter of approximately 2,000 refugees resettled in North Carolina annually through the Federal Offi ce of Refugee Resettlement. Legal ser- vices to refugees and those seeking asylum had been provided by Lutheran Family Ser- vices (LFS) for more than 20 years until LFS closed its Greensboro office on Sept. 30, 2010. Applicants for refugee or asylum status must demon strate that they were persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group , and must meet other legal criteria. The Humanitarian Immigration Law Clinic will assist clients in applying for political asy- lum, permanent residency, citizenship, and employme nt authorization, as well as reunify- ing families separated by war and conflict. Under the supervision of law faculty, Elon Law stu dents will manage all aspects of refugee and asylee cases, meeting with clients, per forming intake interviews, analyzing cases for legal remedy, gathering evidence, draftin g and filing applications and briefs, and maintaining client correspondence. Students will al so observe and participate in hearings before federal administrative agencies and courts. The law school anticipates that the clinic w ill handle approximately 500 to 600 refu- gee and asylum cases annually in its initial stages , serving clients from numerous coun- tries. In recent years, refugees resettling in Guil ford County have come from Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burma, Congo, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast , Laos, Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan, among others. Each student participating in the clinic will spen d at least 107 hours per semester representing clients and 13 hours per semester in c lasses associated with the clinic. Grant 33 will be joined at the clinic by a clinical practiti oner-in-residence, an immigration coun- selor, and a clinic paralegal. The clinic will be h oused in Elon Law's Clinical Law Center at 210 West Friendly Avenue in Greensboro, N.C., joini ng the school's Wills Clinic and Juve- nile Justice Intervention and Mediation Clinic. The North Carolina Refugee Assistance Program, par t of the North Carolina Depart- ment of Health and Human Services, has selected the Humanitarian Immigration Law Clinic at Elon University School of Law to be an of ficial program provider to refugees in the state for elderly citizenship and naturalization se rvices. The Jacob Burns Community Legal Clinics The George Washington University Law School Professor Jessica Steinberg , our terrific new colleague, has arrived. Jessica comes to us from Stanford Law School where she was a clinical teaching fellow and a supervising attorney with Professor Juliet Br odie in Stanford's Commu- nity Law Clinic. Jessica joins Professor Laurie Kohn , director of the newly renamed Fam- ily Justice Litigation Clinic, as a pioneer of GW's clinical tenure track, an important devel- opment in our law school's history. During the spring semester, Jessica has been teach ing and supervising in the Public Justice Advocacy Clinic with Professor Jeffrey Gutman , but she will be launching a brand -new Community Legal Services Clinic in Fall 2011. The clinic will provide representa- tion to clients in housing, public benefits, and co nsumer matters and will have a particu- lar focus on serving the civil legal needs of ex-of fenders. The clinic will also engage in local policy advocacy that benefits its clients and enhan ces access to justice. At the AALS Annual Meeting in San Francisco in Jan uary, 2011, Jessica discussed her vision of clinical education on a panel co-spon sored by the Sections on Poverty Law and Clinical Legal Education. In the context of di scussing her research on the efficacy of various types of unbundled legal services, Jessica suggested that clinics can be sites for community-based research, which can both engage stu dents in access to justice issues and broaden their understanding of the operation of the justice system for low-income liti- gants. Another new addition to the GW clinical community is Pallavi Rai Gullo , Esq., our Managing Attorney. Pallavi is a 2001 alumna of GW Law School, where she participated in the Law Students in Court program and what was then known as the Administrative Advo- cacy Clinic, taught by Professor Jeffrey Gutman. F ollowing graduation she worked in the D.C. area in a variety of non-profit settings. We are delighted that Pallavi has returned to the clinics in this new role, and we have already b enefited greatly from her presence. During the 2010-11 academic year, GW's clinical fa culty, fellows, students, and 34 alumni have been actively engaged in many important cases and projects. In January, 2011, Jamesa Drake, a 2002 alumnus of GW's Federal, Criminal, and Appellate Clinic (FAC) and an appellate attorney for the Kentucky De partment of Advocacy, argued her cli- ent's case, Kentucky v. King, before the United Sta tes Supreme Court. (Another GW alumna argued the U.S. government's case on behalf of the Solicitor General appearing as amicus curiae.) FAC's faculty and students were in attendance during the Supreme Court argument, and later Jamie visited the Clinics to di scuss with clinic students the underly- ing proceedings in her client's case as well as the path her career has taken due, in part, to her experience in the GW Clinics. Also in January, 2011, FAC's Visiting Professor Kelly Knepper-Stephens argued State v. Northam in Maryland's highest court. The case reached the court in 2010, after a FAC student-attorney persuaded the Maryland Court o f Special Appeals to reverse and re- mand her client's felony murder conviction, because the trial judge had failed to address the client's repeated requests to discharge his att orney. When the Maryland Court of Ap- peals granted the government's petition for certior ari in the case, FAC students and Pro- fessor Knepper-Stephens developed arguments designe d to protect their victory below. FAC student-attorneys are now preparing the rest of their cases for spring semester oral arguments on a variety of appellate issues. In addition to assisting a number of small busines ses and non-profits throughout the year, students in Professor Susan Jones' Small Business & Community Economic Development Clinic have been engaged in a policy and research project focused on com- munity workforce development. Aided by Professor J ones and Friedman Fellow Jacque- line Lainez , teams of students have been investigating, and dr afting reports on, programs, practices, and trends in four areas: vocational hig h schools, human development pro- grams, programs for formerly incarcerated people, a nd contributions of innovation and the arts to community economic development. In the pro cess, students are observing the con- nections between their work on behalf of clients an d issues of social policy. In the Vaccine Injury Clinic taught by Professor Peter Meyers , students have ob- tained a settlement of more than $800,000 on behalf of a single mother who works full- time taking care of her young daughter who develope d a pervasive developmental disorder as the result of a vaccination she received in 2002 . The Department of Health and Human Services had been contesting the role that the vacc ine played in precipitating the disorder, requiring the clinic students to prepare the case f or trial. Prior to trial, however, lawyers for HHS made a settlement offer which will generate the resources needed to provide the lifelong care that the young girl needs. An article entitled The Immune Response published in the October issue of the ABA Journal featured quotes by Professor Meyers. The a rticle discusses the pending Supreme Court case of Bruesewitz v Wyeth, involving statuto ry interpretation of the National Child- hood Vaccine Injury Act adopted by Congress in 1986 . Students in the Vaccine Injury Clinic attended oral argument in the case, held on October 12, 2010. Students in the Immigration Clinic , taught by Professor Alberto Benitez who has been ably assisted by Rachael Petterson (J.D. '10), obtained cancellation of removal for a client from Mexico who had experienced domestic vio lence throughout her life. The client was placed into removal proceedings after she accep ted a plea bargain to misdemeanor as- sault, which was the result of false charges presse d by an abusive boyfriend. The Depart- ment of Homeland Security argued that the client's guilty plea rendered her ineligible for cancellation of removal, but the student-attorneys persuaded the court of her eligibility and successfully obtained lawful permanent resident status for her, enabling her to re- 35 main in the United States with her teenage son, a U .S. citizen. Student-attorneys in the Immigration Clinic also obtained cancellation of re moval and lawful permanent resident status for a client from El Salvador and won asylum for an Ethiopian client who, as an ethnic Tigrean and member of the Baha'i faith, had been subjected to detention and perse- cution by government officials. In addition, stude nt-attorneys obtained lawful permanent residency for clients from Morocco, Mauritania, and Bangladesh. In January, 2011, students in the Civil and Family Litigation Clinic , taught by Professors Joan Strand and Laurie Kohn, and Friedman Fellow Vanessa Batters , argued a motion to increase child support payments, filed on behalf of a single mother caring for a mentally handicapped child. The court granted the motion. Students are monitoring the enforcement of the court's order to ensure that the ir client receives the payments she needs in a timely manner. On October 19, 2010, Pro fessor Kohn spoke on a panel organ- ized by the D.C. Bar about what family law attorney s need to know about domestic vio- lence. The Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and Appeals Pro ject (DV LEAP ), di- rected by Professor Joan Meier , has received a $450,000 grant from the U.S. Depar tment of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women. The grant will fund DV LEAP's Custody and Abuse Project, which will provide trainings to judges, lawyers, experts, advocates, and pro se litigants on the misuse of science in custody and a buse litigation. In November, Professor Meier argued E.J. v. D.J ., an appeal on behalf of a survivor of abuse and h er chil- dren, to the D.C. Court of Appeals. In October, Pr ofessor Meier addressed the annual con- ference of the National Association of Women Judges held in San Francisco, serving on a panel about Confrontation Rights and Domestic Viole nce with Jeffrey Fisher, Supreme Court lawyer and lead architect of recent developme nts in confrontation jurisprudence. On October 21, 2010, Professor Meier spoke to the F amily Court Conference of the D.C. Superior Court about vicarious trauma in work on ch ild sexual abuse, serving on a panel with a psychologist. On October 26, 2010, Professo r Meier gave a talk entitled \"The Evolu- tion of an Advocate\" to GW Law's Feminist Forum. I n September, Professor Meier was a panelist and keynote speaker on family courts and d omestic violence at the second annual Washington Domestic Violence Symposium, held at the Seattle University School of Law. In November, 2010, Professor Arturo Carrillo presented \"Whither the Human Rights Clinic?\" as a panelist at a symposium on Re-imagini ng International Law, held at the Uni- versity of Maryland School of Law. On September 30 , 2010, Professor Carrillo gave pres- entations on human rights and clinical legal educat ion at an international conference sponsored by the Supreme Court of Mexico and held a t one of Mexico's major private law schools. Thereafter he traveled to Bogota, Colombi a, to speak at Universidad del Rosario on human rights clinics and public interest law for an audience of Latin-American law professors. While in Colombia, he also celebrated the release of a Spanish-language book on Group and Class Actions in Cases of Gross Human Rights Violations, a text co- authored by GW's International Human Rights Clinic. 36 On October 1, 2010, Professor Phyllis Goldfarb , Associate Dean for Clinical Pro- grams, presented a paper co-authored with Professor s Deborah Maranville, Russell Engler, Susan Kay, and Mary Lynch at New York Law School's Conference on the 25 th Anniversary of the Clinical Theory Workshop. The paper is enti tled \"Revision Quest: A Law School Guide to Designing Experiential Courses Involving R eal Lawyering.\" On October 20, 2010, Dean Goldfarb spoke about experiential learni ng across the curriculum as part of the faculty colloquium series at Albany Law School. On October 22, 2010, she presented \"Revision Quest\" to the New England-area Clinical T heory Workshop, and on December 11, 2010, she presented with her co-authors at the Society of American Law Teachers (SALT) conference held at the University of Hawaii. She also presented a paper at the SALT conference on lessons to be drawn from the exo neration of a capital defendant. A Spanish language version of Dean Goldfarb's article , \"Picking Up the Law,\" which origi- nally appeared in the University of Miami Law Review , was published as \"Escogiendo lished in Buenos Aires. Professor Susan Jones has been selected for a distinguished service award by the Washington Area Lawyers for the Arts (WALA). WALA will present the award to Professor Jones at a gala reception on February, 17, 2011. F riedman Fellow Shana Tabak has won an Audre Rapoport Prize for her paper on Gender and Human Rights. The monetary prize also includes an offer of publication in the workin g paper series of the Rapoport Center for Human Rights and Justice at the University of Texas School of Law. Professor Jeffrey Gutman , director of the Public Justice Advocacy Clinic, w as elected to the boards of the Center for Dispute Set tlement and the Washington Council of Lawyers.

Professor Arturo Carrillo has been appointed to the Executive Board of the AB A's Center for Human Rights. PBS NewsHour Featured Harvard Law School Anti-Foreclosure Work; Conference Spreads \"No One Leaves\" Model to Other Cities The ground-breaking efforts by Harvard Law School clinical students to staunch the foreclosure crisis in Boston were featured in a two -part series on the PBS NewsHour on Oct. 19 and 20. The work of students in the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and the WilmerHale Legal Services Center includes an innovative effort , Project No One Leaves, through which students go door to door to contact every homeowner or tenant in a home under foreclo- sure to inform them of their legal rights and offer them free legal representation. In con- junction with a community partner, CityLife/VidaUrb ana, and with Boston Community Capital, a local community bank, the students have also created innovative program that enables people to purchase their foreclosed-on home s at current market value, a price well 37 below the outstanding mortgage amount. So far, more than 100 Boston residents have purchased back their foreclosed-on homes through th is program. http://www.pbs.org/ wgbh/pages/frontline/video/flv/generic.html?s=news0 1n4480qfa8 On Nov. 15 and 16, 2010, more than 100 law students , lawyers, and community or- ganizers from around the country gathered at Harvar d Law School for a two-day confer- ence, \"Community Responses to the Foreclosure Crisi s.\" Sponsored by the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, the oldest student-run legal services o rganization in the country, the confer- ence offered lectures and workshops on the various aspects of the law school's anti- foreclosure work, which, in addition to the neighbo rhood canvassing and the home buy- back program, includes drafting ground-breaking leg islation to protect tenants and land- ing big verdicts against banks for not keeping prop erties in good repair. Conference par- ticipants included students from the University of Miami Law School, who have already launched No One Leaves Miami, and well as organizer s and lawyers from Chicago, Min- neapolis, St. Louis, Providence, Philadelphia, New York, New Jersey, and California. Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program Receives Award The Conflict Prevention and Resolution Institute ( CPR) selected the Harvard Negotia- tion and Mediation Clinical Program (HNMCP) to be t he recipient of its 2010 Problem Solving in the Law School Curriculum Award at its annual awards banquet on January 11, 2011 at the New York offices of Fulbright & Jaw orski LLP. The clinic's director and founder, Harvard Law School Clinical Professor Robert C. Bordone , traveled to New York to receive the award with HNMCP Associate Tobias Berkman . Speakers and special guests included CPR President and CEO Kathleen Bryan, memb ers of the CPR Board of Directors, and other leaders in the field of Alternative Dispu te Resolution. The CPR award in this category is for effective t eaching of problem solving theory and practice in any law school during either of the preceding two academic years. Criteria for evaluation included innovation in teaching prob lem solving; substantive and pedagogi- cal strength; ability to be adapted by other law te achers and schools; and other distin- guishing or particularly meritorious features of th e course or clinic. \"It was extremely gratifying to receive such an honor in only our cli nic's fourth year of existence. I am very proud of the work we've done to build our clinic, a nd thankful for the hard work and ex- pertise of my colleagues in helping to make this ha ppen,\" said Bordone. Five Skadden Fellowships Awarded to Clinical Studen ts at Harvard Law School Four Harvard Law School students and one recent gra duate - all very involved in the law school's Clinical Program -- have been chosen t o receive Skadden Fellowships to sup- port their work in public service. This prestigious fellowship was awarded to 29 people this year. The Harvard recipients are Elizabeth Benton ' 11, Stephen Cha-Kim '11, Zabelin ' 10. Benton, who has worked on housing issues at the Ha rvard Legal Aid Bureau, will 38 work at the law school's WilmerHale Legal Services Center in Jamaica Plain, Mass., repre- senting low-income tenants and former homeowners fa cing post-foreclosure evictions. She will work with community organizations and financia l institutions to create long-term af- fordable housing for families and communities. Zabelin, also an alumnus of the Bureau, will work at Rhode Island Legal Services in Providence, R.I., to enforce state and federal meas ures designed to protect low-income homeowners from foreclosure, using impact litigatio n, negotiation and community educa- tion. Cha-Kim, who worked on human rights issues for two semesters with the Harvard International Human Rights Clinic and also did an i ndependent clinical project in the area of human rights in Korea last winter, will work at Make the Road New York in Brooklyn, N.Y. He will engage in community outreach, strategi c litigation and collaboration with state agencies to combat retaliation against low-wa ge immigrant workers for reporting wage violations. Saldarriaga, an alumnus of the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic, will work at Community Legal Services and Counseling Center i n Cambridge, Mass., representing immigrant LGBT youth who are victims of abuse or ne glect, to enforce juveniles' right to education and freedom from harm. He will also creat e community education programs and conduct research on courts' treatment of sexual ori entation as a factor in granting protec- tions to abused or neglected youth. Werth, who was a student in the Employment Law Cli nic, will work at Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law in Chicago e ngaging in direct representation, im- pact litigation, policy advocacy and media outreach to address municipal government ac- tions that displace low-income tenants and threaten the supply of affordable housing throughout Illinois. Harvard Law School Independent Clinical Program Gro ws Last month, more than 80 students participated in Harvard Law School's Independ- ent Clinical Program during Winter Term, through wh ich they worked at legal services or- ganizations, government agencies, and NGOs througho ut the U.S. and the world. Students worked in Australia, Brazil, China, Israel, South A frica, and more. Project ranged from working on indigenous rights in Chile to assisting with war crimes prosecution in Cambo- dia. Students are required to receive significant s upervision from their attorney supervi- sors, submit weekly reports describing their work, and write an academic paper upon their return under the sponsorship of a Harvard faculty m ember. The law school provides significant funding to offs et travel and housing expenses for most of the students. Students may also do independent c linical work during the fall and spring semesters, for Boston-area legal organizations and similar placements. 39 LEWIS AND CLARK LAW SHOOL Kathy Hessler made the following selected recent presentations an d activies: Legal Perspectives on Animals in Agriculture, on a panel with Daniel Imhoff and Kendra Kimbirauskas, InFARM, Portland - November 2010 Animal Testing: Legal, Scientific, and Philosophic al Concerns and Consequences, Sec- ond World Congress on Bioethics and Animal Rights: The Prospect for Life on a Chang- ing Planet Salvador, Bahia, Brazil - August 2010 Animal Law, with Pamela Frasch and Teresa Candela, University of Barcelona, at the Federal University Bahia, Brazil - August 2010 Animal Law, with Pamela Frasch, at Liberdade Univer sity, Bahia, Brazil August 2010 The Future of Toxicity Testing: A Legal Perspective , on a panel with Julie Hatcher (Latham & Watkins), Dr. Michael Holsapple Exec.

Messitte, in federal court in Greenbelt on a Motion to Intervene in a Clean Water Act lawsuit brought by the State of Maryland agains t a coal ash landfill owned my Mirant Mid-Atlantic, in Prince George's County, MD. Jud ge Messitte also denied Mirant's Motion to dismiss the case, which the clinic also briefed and argued. Coal ash is a very toxic by-product generated by c oal-driven electric power plants. Mirant's Brandywine landfill is leaking a nd is discharging toxic pollutants, in- cluding arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and seleni um, into both surface and ground waters. The clinic represented four clients, the Patuxent Riverkeeper, the Maryland chap- ter of the Sierra Club, the Defenders of Wildlife a nd Chesapeake Climate Action Net- work. Among other issues, the case raised the issu e of whether discharges of pollutants to ground waters that have a hydro geologic connection to surface waters are covered by the Clean Water Act - an issue that has not been litiga ted in the Fourth Circuit. 40 Tina Meyers, a fellow with the Environmental Clinic did a great job in her first argument in federal court. For more than a decade, Professor Doug Colbert's Access to Justice Clinic along with attorneys Mike Schatzow and Mitch Mirvis s (among others) of Venable, LLP, worked tirelessly in an effort to giv e criminal defendants [especially the poor] a right to counsel when they first appear before a judicial officer. After many court actions, the Summary Judgment was granted to our client. Whi le there is still a long way to go, this is an important step to guarantee the poor acc ess to attorneys at critical stages of their proceedings. Professor Peter Holland's Consumer Protection Clinic recently won a significant victory arguing a new statute geared towards protec ting people who seek help from immi- gration consultants. Student attorney Kiantar Bentacourt was assisted by student attor- ney Ted Riley . Together, they completed the brief and argued the case that resulted in the client receiving all of her money back, along with treble damages and attorney fees that will go directly to our clinic to assist other clie nts. a great result for a client who was de- frauded by an immigration consultant. Professor Maureen Sweeney and the Maryland Immigrant Rights Coal tion received the Public Service Award. The MIRC is a n on-profit organization dedicated to the coordination and enhancement of pro bono representation of low-income immigrants community education, and advocacy on behalf of immi grants. Professor Sweeney is a founding and current board member of MIRC which ass ists Maryland immigrants through the Immigration Law Clinic she directs at the University of Maryland School of Law. 41 Professor Ellen Weber: and the Drug Policy Clinic , which she directs, were recently awarded a $350,000 grant from the Open Society Institute to support Advancing Access to Addiction Treatment, a two-year project. The purpose of the grant is to support the Drug Policy Clinic's re search, education and advo- cacy efforts to ensure expanded access to addiction treatment services in Mary- land as the federal health care reform legislation is implemented. The results generated will form a centerpiece of Professor Weber's sabbat ical research. Leigh Maddox made a recent presentation, \"Your Neighborhood if D rugs were Legal: A Restorative Frame for Post Prohibition Reg ulation,\" Maryland Restorative Justice Conference, Baltimore, Maryland (November 19, 2010) .

The petition argues that deporting people at this moment to Haiti, which is still recovering from the devastating earthquake of January 2010 and dealing with a cholera epidemic, political unrest, and street violence, will result in serious human rights violations. Deportations from the U.S. to Haiti have been staye d on humanitarian grounds since shortly after the Jan. 12, 2010 earthquake. L ast Dec. 9, the United States Immigra- 42 tion and Customs Enforcement unexpectedly announced that it was lifting the ban on de- portations to Haiti for individuals with criminal c onvictions and that it would resume de- portations on Jan. 12, 2011, on the one-year annive rsary of the earthquake. Seven law school students from the Human Rights Cli nic and Immigration Clinic spent much of their winter holidays working long ho urs on the petition. Students con- ducted interviews with the families of detainees, d id legal research, drafted expert declara- tions, and assisted with every aspect of the produc tion of the petition. The human rights petition claims that the new deportations will resu lt in at least a massive increase in the numbers of people held in detention centers in Hait i. The petition also alleges that the United States has violated the human rights of the Haitians who are at risk of imminent deportations by ordering them deported without cons idering critical humanitarian factors, such as the importance of keeping families together , their ties to the United States, and the welfare of their U.S. citizen children. On Jan. 10, 2010, 285 organizations and indi- viduals submitted a letter to the IACHR in support of the petition. For more information, see http://www.law.miami.edu/news.php?article=1755 . Michigan State University College of Law Chance at Childhood (CAC) staff and students are wo rking on a new project (funded by a grant awarded by the Michigan State Court Admi nistrative Office) to evaluate the Genesee County Problem Solving Child (often referre d to as PACT, or Parents and Children Together). This new court was created to assist par ents in breaking down the barriers that impair their abilities to financially support their children. The model for this court is based on other \"problem solving\" courts that address subs tance abuse, domestic violence, prosti- tution, and other unique challenges to traditional approaches in our court system. CAC is also continuing to implement a federal Safe Havens Grant received in part- nership with Ingham County. After countless hours o f hard work by all involved, the county is now moving forward to open a safe exchang e and parenting time center in the near future. This is a terrific achievement and wil l provide a great benefit to families in our community. CAC staff also recently completed work on a grant t o update the state's child repre- sentation training protocol. Staff developed and p resented an interdisciplinary social work/law statewide training to present these update d materials. These efforts are part of CAC's contribution to the larger ongoing statewide effort to improve the quality of repre- sentation and advocacy provided to children and fam ilies in Michigan's child welfare sys- tem. Finally, CAC continues to collect surveys regarding the impact of the pamphlets on Michigan's mandated reporters. Early returns indica te that over 90% of mandated report- 43 ers report that the pamphlets help them better unde rstand how to identify and report child abuse. These are terrific results! International and Comparative Human Rights Law Prac ticum U.S. and Indian law students and faculty came toget her in New Delhi during winter 2010 for the inaugural International and Comparative Human Rights Law Prac ticum, organized by the UNLV, William S. Boyd School of La w, in partnership with the Indira Gandhi National Open University School of Law. Thi s 2-week experiential winter session program was the first effort ever to bring together U.S. and Indian law students, as well law faculty, in a joint practicum. The Indian facu lty included three of India's Marty Geer and Fatma Marouf from Boyd. The program was devel- oped over two years by Profs. Rao and Geer. The U. S. and India are the world's two great- est democracies, with a shared common law system, a nd the program presented a unique opportunity to examine human rights issues in a com parative context. The goals were to build strong, sustained relationships with the Indi an faculty and to cultivate ongoing so- cial justice projects with human rights organizatio ns in India. We also hope that the pro- gram will help U.S. and Indian law students develop long-term partnerships that will 44 shape and strengthen their work as future lawyers. The basic structure of the program linked classroom learning directly to field based experiences. The first week involved lectures on v arious human rights topics in the morn- ing followed by visits to various human rights orga nizations working on related issues in the afternoon. Topics included: public defense and criminal justice in the U.S. and India; human trafficking and its impact on India and the U S; the rights of children; and com- parative constitutional law. Every lecture includ ed time for small group sessions where U.S. and Indian law students worked closely togethe r to explore various questions, ex- change ideas, and deepen their understanding of eac h other's experiences as law students and their goals as future lawyers. In addition, gu est lectures by prominent human rights lawyers, exposed students to the rich history of hu man rights activism in India. The field visits gave the students an opportunity t o observe organizations working on human rights issues at different levels (local, national& international) using diverse tactics (including education, advocacy, litigation, and organizing) and included the ICRC, Delhi Legal Aid Authority, the Community Law Center in rural Haryana, Sahkti Vahini (an anti-trafficking NGO), UNHCR, and HAQ Center for Ch ildren's Rights. Students visited in- stitutions affiliated with the legal system, includ ing criminal courts, Tihar Prison (the larg- est in Asia), and pre-trial detention facilities for juveniles. These visits exposed students to a wide range of tools that lawyers and advocates use in order to shift power structures, promote justice and protect human rights. During the second week, students worked more intens ively with one particular or- ganization and, after consultation, planned a resea rch paper to write after returning to the U.S. of use to the organization. They will need to stay in contact with their organization to ensure ongoing input. For the U.S. students, being immersed in a totally new setting made them think critically about some of their assumptions regarding how justi ce systems can (and should) operate, the role of lawyers, and how to learn and manage ne w skill sets to work effectively in a dif- ferent culture. They learned to see the \"content\" of a problem differently and to think in more creative ways about problem solving, whether d ue to limited resources, inefficient and backlogged courts, or corruption. Students also had the opportunity to reflect deeply on the U.S.'s role in perpetuating some of the human rights problems in India, such as the use of child labor to make goods sold in western countries, or the trafficking of pe rsons from India to the U.S. They kept journals where they reflected on their daily experi ences. Being exposed to a new level of extreme poverty also changed the perspectives of ma ny U.S. students, shifting their con- textual understanding of deprivation. Other shifts in understanding related to differing conceptions of caste in India vs. class-based discr imination in the U.S.; notions of gender identity and the different relationships in their i mmigrant/refugee populations. They learned a great deal from each other and came to se e their own countries differently. The practicum does not fall into any of conventiona l models for clinical education. It is not an in-house clinic nor typical externship bu t combines various aspects of each. By 45 engaging actively with human rights organizations, students had the \"real-life exposure,\" while also having the opportunity for guided reflec tion and discussion. This model cap- tures the essence of experiential learning by havin g the students engage in action, followed by periods of reflection and analysis with professo rs and peers, and then returning to the field with new ideas for achieving their goals.

THE ONE MINUTE UPDATE FROM SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW Students continue to argue appeals in juvenile case s and unemployment compensa- tion cases in the Missouri Court of Appeals. Missouri Lawyers Weekly 's list of Major Opin- ions for the Second Half of 2010 includes two cases handled by Professor Tricia Harrison and her students in the Child Advocacy Clinic . The Clinic obtained reversals of delin- quency judgments in both cases. The publication al so named three unemployment com- pensation cases handled by Professor John Ammann and his Litigation Clinic students. Clinic students and faculty helped secure a prelimi nary injunction from a U.S. District 46 Court ordering the State of Missouri to provide inc ontinence supplies to poor Missourians who receive Medicaid assistance. The case was file d by Legal Services of Eastern Missouri and a local private firm, with assistance from Clin ic students and faculty. The ruling will allow highly vulnerable Missourians who need adult diapers to remain in their homes in- stead of having to move to nursing homes because of their incontinence Students in the Externship Clinic , supervised by Professor Amany Ragab Hacking , are busy conducting preliminary hearings in crimina l cases, helping clients obtain orders of protection, assisting attorneys in drafting and revising contracts, as well as researching and writing on various legal issues. Judicial Externship Clinic students, also supervised by Professor Amany Ragab- Hacking , are working with judges and law clerks at the sta te and federal level, both in trial and appellate courts, in Missouri and Illinoi s. They are researching legal issues and preparing drafts of orders, memoranda, and opinions for the judges to review. They are engaged in both criminal and civil cases, and are a ble to observe many phases of litigation ranging from pre-trial discovery issues through tri al. Elder Law Clinic students, supervised by Professor Barbara Gilchrist, are focusin their attention on guardianship cases, meeting with clients, preparing pleadings, and ap- pearing in the probate division to advocate for the ir clients' interests. Some of these mat- ters involve challenging family dynamics and some i nclude cross-petitions on behalf of family members when the state protective agency has initiated a guardianship. The Community & Economic Development Clinic , supervised by Professor Dana- Malkus , is working with several start-up and existing non profit organizations and small businesses providing a variety of services to the l ocal community, including cultural edu- cation, natural resource preservation, affordable h ousing, low-cost daycare, and access to local and organic foods. The CED Clinic is also pr eparing to conduct closings for six Habi- tat for Humanity homes later this semester, with se veral more closings scheduled to take place this summer. In connection with a local bar association an d Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, Pro- fessor Brendan Roediger helped organize the School of Law's Pro Bono Day, a day of free, helpful, and relevant continuing legal education se ssions to equip our local legal commu- nity to provide needed pro bono services. Professors Tricia Harrison and Sue McGraugh presented \" Using Clinics to Attack the Public Defender Crisis \" at the Midwest Clinical Conference at Northwester n University on November 6, 2010. Their presentation reported how the Child Advocacy Clinic and the Criminal Defense Clinic were attempting to help alleviate the overwhelming caseloads of the St. Louis area public defenders. Professor Amany Ragab Hacking has given recent presentations on Islam and the de ath penalty and social justice as it relates to immigra tion law. In addition, she recently wrote an article for the local news discussing the Egypti an revolution and will be part of an up- coming panel discussion at the School of Law regard ing this revolution and the future of Egypt. 47 Linda E. Fisher , Professor of Law, Seton Hall Law School Center fo r Social Jus- tice, was selected by the Association of American L aw Schools in December 2010 as a Bellow Scholar , an honor given each year to academicians who seek to advo- cate for social justice in their communities. Prof . Fisher was chosen as a Bellow Scholar based upon her empirical work, \"The Links Between t he Foreclosure Process and Aban- doned Urban Property,\" a study of the \"ripple effec ts\" of the foreclosure crisis in Newark, NJ, and, in particular, the social costs of abandon ed property in low-income neighbor- hoods. On November 18, 2010, Prof. Fisher testifie d at the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, House Financial Services Com mittee's hearing on Robo-Signing, Chain of Title, Loss Mitigation & Other Issues in M ortgage Servicing. Prof. Fisher's testi- mony focused primarily on the relationship between faulty foreclosure practices and fraud, as well as the consequences for homeowners and neig hborhoods. Prof. Fisher described for the Subcommittee the steps in a judicial forecl osure in which robo-signing can occur and drew links between widespread origination fraud in subprime lending, opportunistic fraud, such as foreclosure rescue scams, and the as sembly-line foreclosures that further destabilize urban communities . Shavar D. Jeffries , Associate Professor of Law, Seton Hall Law School Center for Social Justice, presented a moving tribute to D r. Martin Luther King, Jr. at an annual event celebrating Dr. King's life on January 13, 20 11 at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, NJ. Prof. Jeffries, who recently was elected to the Newark Schools Advi- sory Board, focuses his clinical work and scholarsh ip on education and housing inequities affecting urban communities. Prof. Jeffries' remar ks can be Transitions Patricia Perlmutter served as a Visiting Assistant Clinical Profe ssor in the Civil Litigation Clinic of Seton Hall Law School Ce nter for Social Justice from January- December 2010, returned to private practice. L. Danielle Tully completed her term as a Clinical Teaching Fellow i n the Civil Rights and Constitutional Law Clinic and the Civil Litigation Clinic at the Seton Hall Law School Center for Social Justice in January 2011. Request to Inter American Commission on Human Right s to Hold Hearing on 48 Medical Repatriation Lori Nessel , Professor of Law, Dean's Fellow and Director of S eton Hall Law School Center for Social Justice, and Rachel Lopez , a Clinical Teaching Fellow for the Equal Justice Clinic and the Immigrants' Rights/International Human Rights Clinic, have requested that the Inter American Com- mission on Human Rights hold a general hearing on t he human rights implications of the U.S. practice of forced or coerced medical repatria tion of seriously ill or injured hearing request: http://law.shu.edu/ProgramsCenters/ PublicIntGovServ/CSJ/upload/ Seton_Hall_Request_for_Hearing_on_Medical_Repatriat ion-fnl.pdf \"All Work and No Pay: Day Laborers, Wage Theft, an d Workplace Justice in New Jer- sey\" Issued by Seton Hall Law School in January 201 1 In August 2010, the Seton Hall Law School Center fo r Social Justice released a re- port, \" Ironbound Underground ,\" which documented rampant wage theft and other vi ola- tions among day laborers in the East Ward of Newark , NJ. Following the release of Iron- bound Underground , various organizations and advocates working with day laborers throughout New Jersey asked that the Center for Soc ial Justice's Immigrants' Rights/ International Human Rights Clinic conduct similar s urveys of day laborers in selected communities throughout New Jersey. The Center for Social Justice agreed to do so and in the fall of 2010, students in the Clinic and partne r organizations surveyed day laborers and interviewed day laborer advocates, mayors, poli ce chiefs, and municipal prosecutors about workplace conditions for day laborers. These extensive efforts resulted in a report , \"All Work and No Pay: Day Laborers, Wage Theft, and Workplace Justice in New Jersey,\" issued in January 2011. The report found that 54% of day laborers experienced at least one instance in the last year of an em- ployer paying less money than promised; 48% experie nced at least one instance of not be- ing paid at all; and 94% of those who on occasion w orked over 40 hours per week reported that employers failed to pay them the overtime amou nt required by state and federal laws. Wage theft causes substantial income loss to the wo rkers. Forty-three percent of day la- borers suffered total losses from wage theft betwee n $100 and $1,000 in the past year; 14% suffered losses of $1,000 or more. Sixty perce nt of the workers earned $200 or less per week in colder months and 78% averaged between $200 and $500 per week in the warmer months. The report further found that work ing conditions frequently were un- safe, 26% of day laborers reported being assaulted by employers and 35% were abandoned at a worksite, and yet only 14% reported the assaul ts to the police and only 2.6% reported 49 filing complaints to obtain unpaid wages with the N ew Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. The report recommended that municipalities standard ize the procedures that allow day laborers to file citizen complaints against emp loyers in municipal courts, the New Jer- sey legislature revise New Jersey's current wage th eft statute to make it more accessible to low wage workers and the New Jersey Department of L abor utilize community groups to assist in the investigation and preparation of wage theft complaints. The report was widely reported in the media, including the New York Times , Huffington Post , Star Ledger , El Diario , Record , Asbury Park Press Associated Press/Forbes.com , and AFL-CIO Now. Bryan Lonegan , Visiting Assistant Clinical Professor with the Im migrant Rights/International Human Rights Clinic, co-author ed the report with the assistance of current and former students who, under Prof. Lonega n's supervision, contributed sub- stantially: Perez, Alexandra Saites, Read the .

Stanford Law School Mills Legal Clinic Here are some highlights of the work of a few of th e ten clinics at Stanford Law School: Immigrants' Rights Clinic Prevails on Behalf of Cli ent in Deportation Proceedings Students, faculty and staff of the Mills Legal Clin ic's Immigrants' Rights Clinic re- cently received a significant ruling on behalf of t heir client in a deportation case. Melinda Koster ('11) and Shira Levine ('11) represented M.A., a lawful permanent resi- dent (\"green card\" holder) from Fiji who has lived in the United States with his family for the past 21 years. M.A. has been defending himself from the Department of Homeland Se- curity's (DHS) efforts to deport him for the past s even years. M.A. had some minor brushes with the criminal justice system as a young adult, and DHS alleged that the gov- ernment could deport M.A. based on a 1999 convictio n. M.A. spent five years in immigra- tion detention in Eloy, Arizona, pending resolution of the proceedings. Melinda and Shira moved to dismiss the deporta tion proceedings against M.A. arguing that DHS failed to meet its burden of proof under t he federal immigration laws. After ex- tensive strategic thinking, legal research and cons ultation with their client, Melinda and 50 Shira submitted a legal brief to the immigration co urt arguing that M.A.'s 1999 conviction could not lead to his deportation under Ninth Circu it case law. The Immigration Judge agreed with Melinda and Shira's reasoning and ruled that the government cannot deport M.A. This victory built on the success of Orion Danjuma ('10) and Jenny Kim ('11), who previously defeated DHS's initial charge that M.A. was removable as an \"aggravated felon,\" a classification that would have resulted in almost certain deportation to Fiji. The Immigrants' Rights Clinic is directed by P rofessor Jayashri Srikantiah Cooley Godward Kronish , supervised Melinda and Shira's work. Anna's predecessor, Jennifer Lee Koh , supervised Orion Danjuma and Jenny Kim during their work last spring. Great Quarter for the Organizations and Transaction s Clinic The varied and high-quality work of Mills Legal Cli nic's Organizations and Transac- tions Clinic students is reflected below in a revie w of student work from the Fall 2010 quarter: Esther Cheng ('11) and Brian Murdock ('12) worked closely with the legal team of one of the country's largest philanthropic organiza tions to revise its conflict of interest pol- icy and code of conduct. The team also prepared go vernance documents for and briefed the board of directors of a rural affordable housin g nonprofit, drafted a joint fundraising agreement for a national organization dedicated to advancing justice and democracy, and prepared client engagement and co-counsel agreement templates for a Santa Cruz County nonprofit that provides free legal services to low- income individuals and families. Justin Gonzales ('12) and Richard Robinson ('11) designed and drafted a template alliance/joint venture agreement for a national cha rter school organization, provided gov- ernance advice and developed program contracts for a San Benito County youth services organization, performed a comprehensive governance review for a Bay Area conservation nonprofit, and provided advice about an intellectua l property matter to an East Bay urban agriculture organization. These engagements includ ed two presentations to boards and regular interactions with client CEOs and a client general counsel. Stephenie Gosnell Handler ('11 ) and Ryan Stouffer ('11) provided advice and pre- pared an extensive set of governance documents for a Bay Area nonprofit focused on child abuse prevention. The team worked closely with the CEO and an external management consultant in executing the project and briefing a board committee about the work. Ryan also prepared materials for a meeting of the board of a large Bay Area charter school op- erator. Justin Gonzales ('12) and Ryan Stouffer ('11) drafted a suite of documents for one of O&T's many clients active in sustainable agricul ture, a rural nonprofit focused on the relationships among agriculture, conservation and t he environment. The documents in- cluded facility use, consulting, program and volunt eer agreements. The team also collabo- rated with Richard Robinson ('11) in researching and preparing a complex technical s er- 51 vices agreement for a Bay Area immigration rights o rganization. Stephenie Gosnell Handler ('11 ) joined with a colleague in executing governance reviews for a large health care clinic in Santa Cru z County and a multi-site mental health care services organization, worked closely with a S outh Bay community services organiza- tion in designing and drafting a set of contract an d management documents for a transi- tional housing and rehabilitation program, and prep ared service and volunteer contracts for a leading Bay Area food bank. The team regular ly met with board members, CEOs and CFOs, and visited program sites, in the course of t he work. The Organizations & Transactions Clinic is dir ected by Professor Jay Mitchell . Eva Guttierez serves as the Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe Clinica l Teaching Fellow. Octavio Gonzalez provides wonderful legal assistance. Life Sentence Reversed for Mills Legal Clinic's Thr ee Strikes Project Client On December 14, 2010 a Superior Court in Los Angele s ordered the release of Byron Goodwin , who had been serving a life sentence under the Th ree Strikes law for shoplifting a pair of pants from Sears. He had already served over 14 years for his crime. The court reversed Mr. Goodwin's sentence and order ed him released based on new evidence and argument developed and presented by Th ree Strikes Project students Rachel Marshall ('10) and Saurav Ghosh ('11). Mr. Goodwin was arrested in 1996 while trying to \"r eturn\" the pants, which he had- n't paid for, in order to buy a car seat so he coul d take his newborn daughter home from the hospital. (California law requires that parent s have a car seat before they are allowed to leave the hospital with a newborn.) His prior c onvictions were two non-violent burglar- ies, which he committed on the same day in 1983, wh en he was 18 years old. Mr. Good- win grew up surrounded by extreme violence and pove rty, and his crimes were inextricable from a debilitating drug addiction. Rachel and Saurav uncovered powerful evidence that Mr. Goodwin's previous coun- sel neglected to investigate or present. In extens ive habeas corpus pleadings, they argued that Mr. Goodwin was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel, that the new in- formation constituted newly discovered mitigation e vidence, and that the original sentenc- ing court relied on improper factors\u2014all of which u ndermined the validity of his current sentence. Mr. Goodwin's daughter, now 14 years old, was in th e courtroom with other mem- bers of her family as the Superior Court reversed h er father's life sentence and ordered him released based on the time he already served. The Three Strikes Project is directed by Michael Romano with assistance from paralegal, Lynda Johnston . 52 TEXAS TECH A new clinical program, the Capital Punishment Clinic , was initiated in the Spring semester of 2011 in cooperation with the West Texas Public Defenders Office for Capital Cases. This is the first Public Defenders Office of its type in Texas and is the prototype for representation of those accused of capital crimes. The students will work with the attor- neys, mitigators, investigators and other professio nals in helping to represent those facing the death penalty. Students are supervised by Prof essor Patrick S. Metze and the Chief Public Defender for Capital Cases, Adjunct Professo r Jack Stoffregen , as well as the trial attorneys and staff working at the Public Defenders Office. Texas Tech University School of Law also entered i nto a contract with a consortium of rural counties in West Texas for $564,829 funded through a grant from the Texas Com- mission on Indigent Defense to create the Caprock R egional Public Defender Office. Dur- ing the 2011-2012 academic year, up to 12 students will be placed with that office through an expansion of the current Criminal Defense Clinic . Students will be supervised by Pro- fessor Patrick S. Metze , the Chief Public Defender for the Caprock Regiona l Public De- fender Office, Donnell Yandell, as well as other attorneys and staff with the VANDERBILT LAW SCHOOL Alex Hurder , Clinical Professor at Vanderbilt Law School, has been elected to a three- year term on the Council of the ABA Section of Indi vidual Rights and Responsibilities. The Section helps the American Bar Association in effor ts to protect and advance human rights, civil liberties, and social justice. Alex was chair of the ABA Commission on Mental and Physical Disability Law from 2007 until 2010. VERMONT LAW SCHOOL South Royalton Legal Clinic I.

Staff 53 Art Edersheim Professor Art Edersheim talked to WCAX-TV on Sept. 28 about human trafficking in Vermont. Available: http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=13227960 Alex Banks Staff Attorney Alex Banks has had a large influx of new cases in his Domestic Vio- lence and Children First! caseloads; he appeared la st Fall term in court with numerous students. Alex participated along with Director James May and Staff Attorney Arthur Ed- ersheim in the October 27 Pro Bono Conference hosted by th e Vermont Bar Association (see below). Recently Attorney Banks, in his ongoin g role on the Guardian ad Litem Over- sight Committee, appeared before the Family Court R ules Committee to discuss proposed changes to VRFP 7. Additionally Attorney Banks has participated is several state wide trainings for new GAL(s). Alex has also participate d in Bench-Bar meetings in Orange, Windsor and Washington Counties. Maryann Zavez Maryann attended a consumer law conference in Bosto n on November 12-14, spon- sored by the National Consumer Law Center. She pla ns to use the information in repre- sentation of clients in debt collection defense cas es and other types of consumer cases in civil court. Jim May Along with Alex Banks and Art Edersheim , Jim attended the Celebrate Pro Bono Statewide Conference held on October 27 at the Stat ehouse in Montpelier. Sponsored by the Vermont Bar Association, the conference for the first time brought together providers of free and low-cost legal services from across Ver mont. The morning session was devoted both to a \"roll call\" of providers who described th eir various programs/projects, and to re- ports from several judges on the need for pro bono representation in their courts. The af- ternoon was devoted to creating lists of priorities which could be shared with volunteer at- torneys throughout Vermont, who might wish to volun teer at least 5 hours of their time per year to provide pro bono representation. The various priorities were tallied and will be fur ther considered by the Vermont Ac- cess to Justice Kinvin Wroth, re- cently joined by Jim May as a second representative , representing the South Royalton Le- gal Clinic. III. International The Vermont/Karelia Rule of Law Project (V/KRoLP) will again participate in a Spring educational conference in Petrozavodsk, Russ ia. V/KRoLP's work is supported by funding from U.S. AID, which funds V/KRoLP (as part of the Russian American Rule of 54 Law Consortium, or RAROLC) together with the Ameri can Bar Association's Rule of Law Initiative (ROLI) in a joint project between them, the Rule of Law Partnership Program (RLPP). Among the topics we are exploring for poss ible presentation is Legal Aid in Russia, a subject of interest to our Russian counterparts a s they begin to implement a new Rus- sian Federation law authorizing a nation-wide legal aid program. The Clinic's Jim May is participating in the planning process, and may take part once again in conference activi- ties in Petrozavodsk, or related activities there. IV. Special Projects/Outside Funding The Clinic is operating this fiscal year partially with the support of outside funders including U.S. Department of Justice through the Ve rmont Center for Crime Victim Ser- vices. Listed below are some highlights of our DOJ crime victim representation for the pe- riod July 1 through December 31, 2010: 1. Vermont Immigrant Assistant (VIA): The project represented 16 individuals in 17 cases, provided information consults with 8 other i ndividuals, continued to expand out- reach in collaboration with non-governmental organi zations, and took on new cases. It has maintained active relationships with domestic viole nce agencies in Chittenden, Addison, Rutland and Windsor counties, and in New Hampshire (Hanover). Project Coordinator Ar- thur Edersheim served as a presenter at the \"New Ne ighbors\" Statewide Conference held on October 12, 2010, at which he discussed \"Legal a nd Law Enforcement Issues\" and \"Human Trafficking.\" He also participated as a pane list or presenter at three other immi- gration-related events between July 1 and December 31, 2010. Since 2003, VIA has rep- resented individuals from 47 countries. Once again , this project shows what a modest- sized legal clinic in a relatively small law school setting can do in terms of making a big impact on a big problem. Over the past 6 months, VI A has represented clients from 7 of Vermont's 14 counties, and from New Hampshire as we ll. In Burlington, at the offices of Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program (VRRP), VIA ga ve information to 32 persons over the last half of the year 2010. 2. Prison Projects (Families in Crisis Legal Aid P roject (FICLAP) and Prisoner Child Support Project (PCSP)): FICLAP Project Coordinator Maryann Zavez continued her visits to Northwest State Correctional Facility (NWSCF) ev ery 3-4 weeks and met with 16 new re- ferrals. One student participated in the project du ring the summer, and four students par- ticipated in the Fall semester. Attorney Zavez's ar ticle on access to justice that features the FICLAP prison project as well as various other law schools' innovative projects, was pub- lished in the October 2010 \"Family Court Review.\" T he title of this article is Law School Programs Provide Access to Justice and Distill a Co mmitment to Serve, Family Court Review, Vol. 48, Issue 4, 672-84 (October 2010) . FICLAP met its goal of assisting female NWSCF in - mates who have family law issues and helping them n avigate judicial and administrative proceedings in which they were involved. Most of t hese proceedings involved custody, visi- tation and CHINS (juvenile) proceedings. Many of th e women were successful in gaining greater access to their children; law students were involved in virtually every visit to the 55 prison. PCSP: South Royalton Legal Clinic Directo r James May continued prison visits at Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility (MVRCF ) with one student per visit, joined by Vermont Office of Child Support (OCS) personnel, to address prisoner child support is- sues. Under the guidance of Professor May, the num ber of visits to MVRCF increased to 3; a total of 10 prisoners were seen; they were interv iewed about their past and current child support obligations, and assisted in completing and filing modification requests. The pa- pers will be filed in court by OCS, which also waiv ed various arrearages owed to it. Appellate Advocacy Clinic Students in this year's Appellate Advocacy Clinic, supervised by Professor and Clinic Director John Korzen , have made three oral arguments and are handling t hree other ap- peals. Students typically work in pairs on a singl e appeal and help prepare other pairs for oral argument. In September, 3L John Byron argued to the United States Court of Ap- peals for the Fourth Circuit, in United States v. Thomas , 627 F.3d 534 (4th Cir. 2010). The issue on appeal was whether the district court erre d in concluding that a beneficial Su- preme Court interpretation of a criminal statute do es not apply retroactively unless the Court explicitly so states. In a published opinion decided on December 29, the Fourth Cir- cuit ruled in the Clinic's favor, reversing the dis trict court and also rejecting an alternative ground for affirmance raised by the government. In October, 3L Megan Curran argued to the North Ca rolina Court of Appeals, in Haas v. Jugis . The issue in Haas is whether a restrictive covenant prohibiting a \"commercial enterprise\" on subdivision lots prohibi ts an existing church from paving a parking area on one of the lots. Megan's argument was only the second time the North Carolina Court of Appeals has allowed a law student to argue (the first being a Wake For- est Appellate Advocacy Clinic student in 2008). Most recently, in January, 3L Katie Serfas argued to the Fourth Circuit in Cousins v. Green , a habeas case arising in Maryland state court. T he Fourth Circuit allowed a partial certificate of appealability on an effectiveness of counsel claim. Should the court affirm the decision against Mr. Cousins, the Clinic plans to petition the United States Supreme Court for certiorari on another possible issue invo lving a violation of Brady v. Maryland . The Clinic also made its annual trip to the United States Supreme Court, where stu- dents observed oral arguments in two cases on Janua ry 12, including an argument by Southern District of Indiana Federal Community Defe nder Bill Marsh, toured the Court building, and met with Clerk of Court William Suter for an hour. Mr. Marsh is the father of a Wake Forest professor, and on January 24 he ca me to Wake Forest to meet with the Clinic and discuss his Supreme Court case that they had seen argued. 56 Wake Forest Appellate Advocacy Clinic at U.S. Supre me Court Kate Mewhinney (Wake Forest Elder Law Clinic) spoke at the Nation al Aging and Law Conference in December, 2010 at Alexandria, VA on \"The Role of Medical-Legal Part- nerships in Serving the Elderly.\" Sponsors include d the ABA, the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys, and AARP. Steve Virgil , Director of the Institute for Public Engagement, will once again this se- mester co-lead an interesting course on professiona l development with faculty from the School of Medicine and School of Divinity at Wake F orest. The course brings students from each discipline together to discuss how the profess ional identity is formed and the role the professional plays in community development, povert y alleviation and access to health care. The course is co-taught by faculty from each of the three schools with equal num- bers of students in the seminar. In addition to be ing truly cross-disciplinary, the course integrates a service learning component in Nicaragu a. Over spring break we travel to Nicaragua to work directly with NGO's who work with the faculty members in other ways. For example, I represent one of the NGO's we will visit in my practice within the Community Law Clinic. Closer to home, my clinic recently formed a pa rtnership with the Legal Aid here in North Carolina. Under this we have agreed to accep t 60 foreclosure cases on referral. We are assisting these clients in all aspects of forec losure defense, and enjoying some suc- cess. Although not what I originally planned to be doing, these cases provide students with an excellent opportunity to see how a secured transaction is put together, fails and can be renegotiated back to life - sometimes. 57 The Tribal Court Public Defense Clinic , under the direction of Ron Whitener , serves as primary public defender for the Tulalip Tribes a nd has added Squaxin Island, Port Gamble S'Klallam and Sauk-Suiattle Tribes. Clinic faculty and fellows represent clients throughout the year, assisted by work study student s and summer interns. In addition, Clinic students participated with faculty in extens ive redrafts of portions of the Tulalip Civil and Criminal Code that were later adopted by the Tribes. Clinic faculty also facili- tated visits to the Tulalip Tribal Court by delegat ions from Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Belarus. Collaboration with the UWLS Asian Law Center's Afghan Legal Educators Program continues as Afghan law professors attend C linic seminars and study the Navajo dispute resolution process. After moving to the UW campus this academic year, the Entrepreneurial Law Clinic , directed by Jennifer S. Fan , is fully engaged in assisting technology and social entrepre- neurs, small business owners, and non-profits throu ghout the Pacific Northwest. Seven- teen law and MBA students work in teams with pro bono private attorneys, business men- tors from the community and LLM students of the Federal Tax Clinic to provide early stage business and legal counseling. The Clinic's hybrid model (combining aspects of a traditional clinic with elements of an externship) was developed over several years by Fac- ulty Director, Sean O'Connor . For the second consecutive year students of the Legislative Advocacy Clinic have drafted a bill and pursued its passage in the Washi ngton State Legislature. On behalf of their client, Street Youth Legal Advocates of Washi ngton, students succeeded when SHB 2752, \"An Act Relating to the Safety of Runaway You th,\" was passed. Under the super- vision of Casey Trupin and Justice Bobbe Bridge (Ret.) students of the Clinic also advised the Washington State Bar Association's Juvenile Law Section on pending legislation. Technology Law and Public Policy Clinic students under the direction of Bill Cov- ington are collaborating with the House Technology, Energ y and Communications Com- mittee, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, and the Washington De- partment of Information Services to research and de velop recommendations for state com- munications regulation and policy to meet ongoing c hanges in technology. Tim Jaasko-Fisher , Director of the Court Improvement Training Academy (CITA) has been supporting judges, lawyers and other profe ssionals involved in the Juvenile Court dependency process. He and his small staff h ave hosted 30 trainings throughout Washington State (numbering approximately 1000 atte ndees); additionally, nine counties participate in the \"Tables of Ten\" approach to cour t improvement. CITA operates under the umbrella of the Children and Youth Advocacy Clinic and hosts an informative web- site: www.uwcita.org . Director of the Innocence inic, Jacqueline McMurtrie , was in- ducted into the Public Interest Law Association Hall of Fame . Jackie also received a 58 \"Friend of the Judiciary Award \" from the King County Chapter of the Washington Women Lawyers. Ron Whitener is principal investigator for a MacArthur Foundatio n grant to the UWLS Tribal Court Public Defense Clinic and the Nat ive American Law Center to study tribal juvenile justice in Washington State and to conduct planning for reform efforts in tribal courts. His research will lead to identific ation of barriers to successful juvenile jus- tice programs and to prioritization of juvenile jus tice reform projects in tribal courts. The Washington State Children's Taskforce recognize d Tim Jaasko-Fisher with its Lee Ann Miller Award for his work in furthering the goals of the Childre n's Justice Act through his directorship of the Court Improvement T raining Academy.

The appointment will begin for the 2011-2012 academic y ear. Once it is up and running, the Juelsgaard Clinic w ill be one of ten clinical programs making up the Mills Legal Clinic at Stanford Law Sc hool (the Juelsgaard Clinic is the suc- cessor to the Law School's acclaimed Cyberlaw Clini c). It will provide students opportuni- ties to work as lawyers, on behalf of the clinic's clients, in advocating that intellectual 77 property law and regulatory policy be developed in manners that are keenly sensitive to the goals of promoting innovation and creativity. T he clinic will also work together with various Stanford Law School centers and technology and innovation leaders in Silicon Val- ley. Working under the close supervision of the Director and a Clinical Teaching Fellow, the Juelsgaard Clinic will engage students in using numerous tools, on behalf of the Clinic's clients, to advocate for sound policies th at stimulate the types of innovation that have been, and will continue to be, the engines thr ough which the lives and welfare of the world's inhabitants are improved. We anticipate that the Clinic's work will focus on representing the interests of its cli- ents (primarily non-governmental organizations) in a wide array of subject areas involving the promotion of vital innovation, including: Biotechnology; Information technology; Pharmaceuticals; Clean technology; and Innovations in the creation and distribution of inf ormation. The particular matters to be handled by the Juelsga ard Clinic will be determined by the Clinic Director, although decisions about the o verall direction of the Juelsgaard Clinic's work will be made in consultation with the Law School's Director of Clinical Edu- cation and several other faculty members. The vehicles the Juelsgaard Clinic will use to prom ote its clients' interests will vary in accordance with the context. We anticipate they will include: Drafting and distribution of White Papers on key is sues relating to the impact of policies on the promotion of innovation; Filing Amicus Curiae briefs on behalf of clients in key cases; Drafting legislation and proposed regulations; Commenting and testifying on proposed bills and reg ulations; and Promulgating \"best practices\" that universities and other institutions can use to promote innovation among the members of their commu nities.

This model is quite unique among law scho ol clinics. At the end of the quarter, students generally transfer responsibility on open matters to other students, but may (at the director's discretion) retain some continuing d uties with respect to particular matters as Advanced Clinic students, depending on the circu mstances. Each individual clinic works with a set of full-time students during two q uarters each year.

The appointment as Director of the Juelsgaard Clini c will be accompanied, depending on experience, by either (a) a professorial appointmen t to the clinical faculty, or (b) an ap- pointment for a three-year term as a Lecturer, with the anticipation that the Director will be evaluated for possible appointment to the clinic al faculty in his or her third year at the Law School.
