Although resource orientation, as a part of health promotion, should play a major role in general practice, the anchoring and realizationofresource-orientedapproachesremainsmallinGermany.Theaimofthisstudywastoanalyzewhatresourceorientation means to general practitioners (GPs) and develop strategies as to how this can be facilitated in GP practice. Within a qualitative research approach, 19 semi-structured telephone interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative contentanalysis. Within the interviews, the inclusion of the patients' individual resources is described as core competence of GPs. Supporting the patients' disease coping strategies and self-help were seen as important by GPs. However, perceptions as to which resources are considered to be fundamental ranged widely across the participant group. The results confirm the important roleof resource-oriented approaches in general practice. However, a general definition of resource orientation is needed. In addition, workingconditionsforGPsneedtobetakenintoaccounttoensurethatthesecontributetoahealthywork-lifebalance.Theneed for GP training was identified to improve communication skills. Fu rther integration of GPs in health promotion and communal structureswouldbebeneficial. 1. Background Resource orientation focuses on individual resources (=\"innerpotentials\")ofthepatienttomaintainandimprovepersonal health. Thereby, it is mainly characterized by thesalutogenic perspective stressing on factors that supporthuman health and well-being. In addition, it overlaps orshares common elements with other concepts used in thecontext of health promotion, and complementary andalternative medicine such as sense of coherence, resilience, patientempowerment,orself-efficacy. Traditionally, resource orientation has been researched in the psychological and pedagogical context. Increasingly its importance for primary care is recognized, in particular with regard to the management of chronically ill patients[1-3]. In Germany, in 2002, a pilot project explored the salutogenic orientation in primary care which is a part ofresourceorientationanddescribedthreelevelsofsalutogenic orientation[ 4,5].However,tenyearslaterevidenceaboutthe useofresourceorientationingeneralpracticeisstillscarce. Nevertheless, resource-oriented approaches are increas- ingly for general practitioners (GPs). For theevaluation of a patient's individual resources, GPs workwithinanidealsettingtodiscoverandpromotetheresourcesofthepatientbasedontheirlong-lastingrelationshipwiththepatient. GPs do not only have medical knowledge regardingdiseases and therapies but also build a therapeutic rela-tionship with patients over time. This enables GPs to gainknowledgeaboutthepatient'scopingmechanisms,hisorherindividualresourcesandadditionalavailableresourcesinthecommunity settings. GPs can potentially anticipate possiblecausesofpathogenesisfromasomatic,psychosomatic,social,and/or human dimension [ 6]. Furthermore, GPs are able to assess possibilities for individual approaches to resource 2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine orientation based on their insights about the individual patient. This is of special importance considering the rapidincrease in the prevalence of chronic diseases and multi-morbidity.Commonlyandcharacteristicallyfortheprimarycare setting there arises a long-standing, close relationshipbetween GPs and their patients. Particularly the continuity of care that is concomitant with this long term relationship is associated with greater satisfaction and better healthoutcomes[ 7]. Community resources, such as social services, self-help groups but also sports clubs, kindergartens, or schools areessentialtofacilitatetheidentificationandtheleverageeffectof individual resources. However, including communityresources in a resource-oriented approach requires a well-established cooperation between doctors and local services[8].Todate,littleisknownabouthowGPsareintegratedinto communitiesandhowthiscouldbeoptimizedwithinfuturehealthcaremodels. The study is concerned with the position of resource orientationandresource-orientedapproachesinGPpractice,using a qualitative research approach and focusing on thetreatment of chronically ill patients in primary care. Theprimaryaimwastogainasolidunderstandingofthemeaningof resource orientation from the GP perspective. A furtheraim was to identify possibilities and specific measures tofacilitateresourceorientationintheprimarycaresetting. 2. Methods Togetarealistic,detailedinsightintotheindividual,personalperceptionofGPsregardingresource-orientedapproaches,aqualitative study design consisting of semi-structured one-to-one interviews was chosen and conducted by telephone[9].Thesemi-structuredinterviewguidewasdevelopedand refinedbyconductingtwopilotinterviews. GPs were recruited via the quality circle \"health promo- tion practices\" that took place from 2002 to 2005 (12 invita-tions) and via a German General Practice E-mail List server(300 invitations). Inclusion criterion was the contact with resource-orientedapproaches.Weconsecutivelyincludedall GPsmeetingtheinclusioncriterionandwithinteresttotake partinthestudy. Individual appointments for the interviews were arranged.AllinterviewswerecarriedoutintheDepartment ofGeneralPracticeandHealthServicesResearch,UniversityHospital of Heidelberg, Germany, and were conducted byFranziska Pr \u00a8ufer. Each interview was recorded digitally and transcribedverbatim.Anonymitywaspreservedduringdata analysis, and participants consented on this understanding.Theinterviewswerebasedonthefollowingquestions: (i) Whatdoesresource-orientationmeantoyou? (ii) To what extent are resource-oriented approaches important? (iii) How can resource-oriented approaches be facilitated inprimarycare?Table1:Sociodemographiccharacteristicsofthestudysample( = 18). Gender Female 2 16 4 Ruralarea 7 Sociodemographicdatawasavailablefor18respondentsonly. The goal of the interviews was explained prior to com- mencement to prevent misunderstanding and to allow time for answering possible questions that participants may havehad. The term \"resource orientation\" as understood by the researcher was not explained in prior to every interview, in order to prevent bias as to the meaning of resourceorientation in the responses. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Heidelberg Medical Faculty(S-154/2011). The interviews tookplace fromMay 2011to August 2011. Each interview lasted between 20 and 30 minutes. The anal- ysis was carried out according to the principles of Mayring's qualitativecontentanalysis[ 10] andwasconductedwith the software Atlas.ti. The text material was coded in a deductive and an inductive way. Working independently, Franziska Pr\u00a8uferandAntjeMikschconductedtheprimarycoding.The codes were clearly wasdiscussedinaniterativeprocessamongFranziskaPr \u00a8ufer, Antje Miksch, and Stefanie Joos. In case of discrepancies, discussion took place until a consensus was found. The quotations cited were translated from German by FranziskaPr\u00a8uferandcross-checkedbyAntjeMiksch. 3. Results Altogether, 19 GPs were recruited for the study. Age ranged from 45 to 67 years (mean 55,7 years). Occupational expe-rience as GP ranged between 1 and 37 years. Eighteen weremedical specialists in general practice; one was a medicalspecialistinphysicalandrehabilitativemedicine( Table 1). Two main categories emerged from this analysis: the meaning(abstractideas)andthefacilitation(concreteideas)ofresourceorientationingeneralpractice. Table system Training Research 3.1. Meaning. The interviews showed a very heterogeneous understanding of resource orientation which will be illus- tratedsubsequently.Althoughthefoundationalunderstand-ing appeared similar, GPs focused on different aspects.For the GPs, resource orientation also meant orientatingthemselvestowardstheirownresources. 3.1.1. Meaning for the GP. During the interviews, resource orientation was described as a core competence of GPs. Forexample, \"because these [resource-oriented approaches] arethebasicsofour[GPs']actions\"(GP10).MostGPsstatedthatthese approaches were partly carried out intuitively. More-over, resource orientation was considered to be an attitudet h a tf o c u s e so nt h ei n n e rp o t e n t i a l so fe v e r yi n d i v i d u a l . Some of the GPs expressed a strong need for a common definitiontofurtherestablishresourceorientationandmakeit comprehensible for everybody. During the interviews,resources were amongst other things defined \"as sourcesof a healthy development\" (GP 16). Resources representedan inner potential that differs quite individually from oneperson to another. In addition, assistance towards self-helpandcopingwithillnesswerealsoconsideredtobeanintegralpartofresourceorientationbytheGPs. \"Thatafterallisouraim,tomakepeoplehealthy. Healthy not in a sense that everything is still4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine working,butthatonecanalsobesatisfiedwithlife and the circumstances within which one is living(...).\"(GP10) In addition, the interviews showed the importance of establishingawarenessregardingresources.AccordingtotheGPs, thisisanecessaryprerequisitetoimplementandfosterresource-orientedapproaches. Furthermore, GPs attach importance to resource ori- entation also with regard to their own resources for pre-serving and promoting their own health. Most of the GPswere satisfied with their own living and working situation.However,someoftheGPsreportedperiodsofexhaustionorburnout. During the interviews, the desire for a good work-lifebalancewasevident.Satisfactoryworkingconditionswereemphasized as a core factor in achieving a healthy work-lifebalance.Anappropriateworkload,thepossibilitytoexchangeideaswithcolleagues,andjobsatisfactionallcontributetothestrengtheningofGPs'resources. \"...t h a tIa mt r y i n gt or e d u c em ye m p l o y m e n t duties to a bearable extent, so that it is not too much for me and I can really have an open earforthepatients.\"(GP02) Inaddition,acceptancebytheGPthatthepatientdeclines the GP's preferred therapy method also contributes to theeffectiveresourceorientationofGPs. ParticipantGPsutilizedleisureactivitiestoreducestress. Music, philosophy, and relaxation methods as well as familyandfriendswerementionedfrequently.Ahealthydiet,phys-ical activity, and weight loss were further factors mentionedinthecontextofmaintainingahealthylifestyle. 3.1.2. Supposed Benefits for Patients. The interviews showed theimportanceofcreatingaheightenedawarenessregardingresources.Forexample, \"(...)i ns u c haw a yt h a tap o i n to fv i e we v o l v e s t h a td o e sn o tf o c u so ni l l n e s s ,b u to nap e r s o nwho is now in this special situation and whowi t hh i so rh e ro wnp o s s i b i l i t i e s( ...)wi l lh a v et o cope alone again later on and have to take directresponsibility.\"(GP19) 3.1.3. Opportunities. For the GPs resource orientation opens the potential for working with chronically ill people tobecomemoresatisfying.Intervieweeshadtheimpressionthatpatientscanincreasepersonalautonomywiththeacceptanceof direct responsibility for their health and well-being. Thiscan have benefits for both patients and GPs. Patients canimprove their satisfaction and awareness of health and insharing responsibility, GPs can also achieve improved worksatisfaction. \"Well,Ibelievethatpatientscanprofitimmensely i fo n ep r o c e e d si nt h i sw a y .I ti sam u c hm o r erelaxed working atmosphere for the patient aswell. (...) And in return I do not carry the entireresponsibilityallbymyselfasadoctor,whichisof c o u r s eab u r d e ni nm yp r o f e s s i o n ,b u tc a nh a n doverpartofit.\"(GP19) Additionally, the interviewees explained that when the self-responsibility for health in a patient increases, medicalinterventions and medication intake can be reduced. As anadditional gain, deleterious effects, complications, and costscanbelowered. 3.2. Facilitation. The interviewed GPs did not have a stan- dardizedmethodtostimulatetheirpatients'resources.Meth-odswereveryindividualanddifferedfromdoctortodoctor.In addition, the patient contributed decisively to the choiceof a suitable method of facilitation, as not every patient isreceptive to the same treatment. Furthermore, the opinionsaboutwhichresourcesaremostimportantdifferedconsider-ablyamongGPs. 3.2.1. Communication. According to the interviewees, com- munication is the decisive mean for the facilitation ofresource-orientedapproaches. \" F o rt h et i m eb e i n g ,Iw o u l dl o o ka ti tf r o mt h e p o i n to fv i e wt h a ti ti se s s e n t i a lt oe n t e ri n t oadialogwiththepatient.Thismeansitcannotbeaone-waystreet,wewillhavetoreachanagreementwitheachother.\"(GP03) Inordertoconductaneffectivedoctor-patientconversa- tion, the interviewees considered a common language to beessential.Withrespecttothis,theypointedoutthatlanguagebarriers may emerge during conversations with patientswith a migrant background. Additionally, the importanceof using a language that is comprehensible to patients wasstressed several times. In the context of relevant methods ofcommunication,theintervieweesemphasizedthatquestionsasked by doctors should be open, for instance, questionsabout the patients' subjective theories about their illness:\"How do you explain your illness? \" (GP 12) or to strengthen the patient's own competence: \" What helps you? What does not?\"(GP16).Thishastwoadvantages:ontheonehand,the patientcanbecomeactiveandreflectonhiscurrentsituation.On the other hand, the answers given enable the doctor torespondtothepatientinanimprovedwayandtolookathimorherasawhole. In addition, the interviews showed how rarely questions are actually asked about a patient's background in a GP's practice.Oneofthedoctorsreportedthathehadonlystarteddoingthiswithinthecontextofresourceorientation. In addition to the asking of questions, reporting about otherpatientswasidentifiedasapossiblemethodforopening communication channels. Examples of patients in similar situationscouldhelptoillustratethepresentationofpotential effectsoftherapy.Forexample: \" Th e r ea r ec e r t a i np a t i e n t si nw h i c hi tp r o v e st o be fruitful, but often only if a specific example isgiven,oftheplacewhereitwen twrong. \"(GP08)Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 3.2.2.

Complementary and Alternative Medicine. According to the respondents specific methods of complementaryand alternative medicine offer the opportunity to facilitate resource orientation; explicitly mentioned were Feldenkrais, acoustic bowl therapy, magnetic fields, homeopathy, andkinesiology. \"By this a lot could be adjusted, for example, with acoustic bowls and things could be set inmotion beyond curing effects of course. It is both,preventiveandcurativeanditjustgivesimpetus.\"(GP05) \" S om yo w nr e s o u r c e sIh a v et ob u i l du p ,r e t a i n and improve as well.

Setting realistic goals could also strengthen a patient's motivation. 3.2.5. Settings. The setting (social entities, e.g., schools, dis- tricts, and migrant gatherings) was seen as a further possi- bility to facilitate resource-oriented approaches throughout the interviews. Doctors especially stressed the integrationinto local structures which was described as a very positiveexperience: \" W e l l ,Ia mas p o n s o ro far a c e .I t s 'fi r s tp r i z e goes to the school that enrolls the most studentsfor the run. (...)B yh a n d l i n gi tt h a tw a y ,y o u also signal that you think it makes sense to letchildren exercise without it being about who is the fastest runner but instead about the run as a sharedexperience.\"(GP06) Networking between nonmedical and medical profes- s i o n sw a sp e r c e i v e da sa n o t h e rs t a r t i n gp o i n tf o rt h efacilitation of resource orientation.

From the participating GPs' perspectives, thedevelopment of resource-oriented workplaces in collabora-tion with occupational physicians was an important task,especially considering our aging society. For instance, itwouldbepossibletograntadditionalbreakstoolderemploy-eesandtoconsidertheemployees'agewhenassigningtasks.6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3.2.6.Improvements. Amajorityofrespondentsconsiderthe possibility to spend more time with the patients as well asfinancialreimbursementforconsultationasafoundationforthe improvement of resource orientation. Furthermore, theintegrationofresourceorientationinGPcareby,forexample,establishing resource-oriented consultations was discussed. During the interviews, the question which role a GP plays in regard to resource orientation and health promotion andwhether this is part of his or her professional role at all wasfrequentlyasked. \"...and where it is retorted whether this even is a doctor'sduty.\"(GP14) Additionally,respondentsexpressedtheirwishforbetter representation of resource orientation in medical educationand research. An emphasis was placed on the necessity ofofferingpatient-orientedcounsellingtechniques. 4. Discussion Within this qualitative interview study the importance of resourceorientationforprimarycarewasclearlyemphasized byGPs;neverthelesstherewasaheterogeneousunderstand-ingofwhatresourceorientationmeans.Resourceorientationis regarded to be essential for the doctor-patient communi-cationandrelationship.Furthermore,theinterviewsdemon-strated that resource orientation plays an important role ina double sense: for the GP's own resources and for the careofpatients.Inmanyofourresultsthecloserelationbetweenresource orientation and the concept of health promotionbecame apparent. In contrast to simple resource orientation,thisconceptconcernsallsocietalelementsandconsequentlyananalysisandsubsequentstrengtheningofhealthresourcesisinorder.Asalutogenicperspectiveischaracteristicofboth,resourceorientationandhealthpromotion. The interviewees noted that when GPs use resource orientationtheydonotmerelyseethepatientasapersonwithanillness,butratherasasubjectthatisregardedinhisorherentirety.Sincemedicalmeasuresaretakenbasedonpatient'sindividual resources, most GPs see the consideration ofindividualaspectsasacoreareawithinprimarycare,similartotheGPswithinthisstudy.In2011,theEuropeanassociationWONCA defined six core competences which are requiredfrom a GP, which include an individualistic treatment andah o l i s t i cm o d e l[ 11]. In this context a holistic treatment means the embeddedness in the societal environment. As individualisticandholistictreatmentsarecrucialinresourceorientation,itcanbesuggestedthatresource-orientedactingactually is a fundamental aspect in the working routine ofGPs,evenifthisisnotrepresentedbyprimarycareresearch.Previous studies have shown that GPs feel that they haveinsufficientcapacitiestoexecutehealthpromotiononadailybasis [12]. However, this study shows that resource-oriented methods are already being used intuitively and thereforecould be considered as fundamental approaches withinprimary care that should be addressed more anticipatory.Furthermore, the fact that resource orientation is one of aGPs core competences should be given a larger focus in thediscussion of the redefinition of tasks and responsibilities in thefieldofhealthpromotion. The results indicate that resource orientation plays a crucial role in relation to GPs' own health. Despite thefact that burnout syndrome or exhaustion were only rarelymentionedininterviews,itisnowwidelyknownthatdoctors areparadoxicallyoneoftheoccupationalgroupsmostatrisk of health impairment. Due to the fact that a doctor's stateof health may also impact on a patient's medical care andthereby a patient's health, it is clearly necessary to promotehealthandwell-beingamongmedicalspecialists.Despitethehigh percentage of males in this study, the compatibility offamily and career becomes increasingly important given therising number of women in medicine [ 13,14]. A vital aspect inordertoincreasedoctor'swell-beingisachangeinworkingconditions. A more in-depth examination of methods toincrease resilience and minimise work-related stress wouldalso be beneficial. Moreover, the results pointed out that acontrast to work, for example, leisure activities or relaxationtechniques were an important resource in order to promotemedical specialists' general well-being. In order to combatoverwork, doctors should further learn when to say noa n dt od i s t a n c et h e m s e l v e s[ 15]. Furthermore, psychological problems shouldn't be seen as taboo anymore, in order ford o c t o r st ob ea b l et oa d m i ts i c kp e r i o d sa n dc a t e rt ot h e i rown needs. Other studies concerning stress in the medicalprofession report that doctors need to exchange ideas onstressful situations in a community, which would be easy toimplement,forexample,byutilisingsupervision[ 16]. In addition to an increased awareness of their own re- sources, doctors may also feel relief if patients accept more self-responsibilityfortheirhealth.Inordertodoso,resourceconsciousness as well as watchfulness of one's own bodyneedstobefacilitatedamongpatients.Theymay,forinstance,become more autonomous,active and assume more respon-sibility by receiving instructions from their medical prac-titioner. Thereby, patients can prevent and counteract milddiseases without straining their own health. The provisionof information and skilled advisers in self-help can promoteconfidentinteractionbetweendoctorsandpatients.Thereby,this method increases patient competence and contributesto shared-decision making [ 17]. A limitation, however, is that patients are often not motivated enough to be engagedin independently taking responsibility for their own health[18],especiallyconcerningriskfactorsthatcannotdirectlybe sensed, for example, high blood pressure. Lifestyle changesare often not considered necessary by patients. In this way,the patient should learn how to cope with his or her illnesswith the help of the GP. Therefore patients need to bec o u n s e l e da n ds u p p o r t e db yt h e i rG P .Th i si se s p e c i a l l yt r u efor methods of complementary and alternative medicinewhich are according to this study an important source ofresource orientation. This is in agreement with previousstudies for the field of herbal medicine showing that herbal medicine meets the patients' needs for autonomy, support, andself-care[ 18]. In order to be able to implement resource orientation moreeffectively,doctorswereaskedforageneraldefinitionofthe term. Bringing together the existing approaches aroundEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7 resource orientation with the aim to establish a general definitionwouldbeanimportantstepforpatientcarebutalsoforeducationandfurtherresearch. The results also indicate that currently there is no struc- turedadvancementinimplementingresourceorientation.Inorder to improve this, a working communication between a doctor and his patient is necessary, due to the fact that thisexchangecanpromotecomplianceaswellassignificantlyincreasetheexchangeofinformation[ 19].Techniqueswhich couldpossiblyfosterpatient-orientedcarecouldparticularlyinclude asking questions as well as well-known communi-cation techniques such as active listening. Recent researchshowsthatbalancingdialoguesareafurthermethodofcom-munication,whichcanalleviatethestructuringoflong-termGP treatment of chronically diseased patients. In balancingdialogues, a joint treatment is evaluated, and suggestions ofimprovementarediscussed[ 20]. Th er e s u l t sa l s os h o wt h a tt e a c h i n gc o m m u n i c a t i o n competence as well as resource-oriented approaches areessential in medical training and further education. Existingcompetency-basedcurriculasuchastheCanMedsarepartic-ularlyrecommendedasaguidingmanualforundergraduateand postgraduate education. Within the CanMeds concepthealth promotion and resource-oriented aredescribedintheroleofthe\"Healthadvocate\"[ 21].Integration intoundergraduateandpostgraduatecurriculaisessentialtomake medical students sufficiently sensitive and strengthentheir personal skills in these topics. A manual, which givespractical consultation advice for the use of resources, wouldbeacriticalprerequisiteinordertoimplementandpromote resourceorientation.However,thisrequiresacommondefi- nitionandastrongerevidencebaseforresourceorientation. With regard to facilitation communal resources can offer great potential to treat patients in a resource-orientedmanner.Somedoctorsquestionedwerealreadyintegratedincommunity activities. However, they reported that integra-tionintocommunitiesislargelydependentuponthedoctor'sown commitment due to the fact that structures, whichcould facilitate integration, are generally lacking. In orderto improve these conditions a better network of all actorsinvolvedisadesirablesolution.Thisshouldnotonlyincludeall health-related professions (doctors, nurses, and alliedhealthcareprofessionals),butalsootherprofessionalgroupswithinthecommunity,forexample,inthefieldsofeducationand employment. A key element in supplying healthcare forchronically ill patients is an integration of networking asdescribedwithinthechroniccaremodel,anapproachwhichhas currently also been discussed [ 8,21]. Communal health conferenceswereintroducedforexampleinonefederalstateof Germany in order to supply for network structure. Theseserve as a platform for communication and coordinationfor all actors in health care, and aim to create networks onrelevant topics, in order to jointly solve local problems [ 22]. Additionally, further models for successful interprofessional collaborationshouldbeadvertisedandpromoted. I nt h ei n t e r v i e w s ,t h er o l eo fG P sw a sa l s od i s c u s s e d , and it was mentioned that individual health care is aGP's primary duty within health promotion. Doctors canintroducepatientstohealthpromotionoffers,whichalreadyexist within the community, or can alternatively offer these in their own practices (e.g., nutrition consultation). Oftenhowever,doctorslackknowledgeofhealthcareoffersalreadyestablished within their communities. Another approach infurtherincorporatingGPsintothecommunityandfosteringt h e i rw o r kr e l i e fi sap o s s i b l er e s t r u c t u r eo fa m b u l a n th e a l t h care by strongly integrating other health care professionals. Afterall,mostpatientsvisitingaGPalreadyshowsymptoms.Resource orientation should, however, also be applied tohealthyindividuals. The results, moreover, suggested that there are further possibilities to accommodate for resource-oriented ap-proachesinhealthcare.Aresource-orientedconsultationforchronically ill patients could increase the focus on healthyand positive aspects in the patient's life and improve hisqualityoflife.Anintegrationofresourceorientationinexist-ing structures, for example, established medical check-upsalso seems promising. Lastly, the use of a resource-orientedquestionnaire,whichconcernsthepatients'differentareasoflifeaswellastheircapacities,couldprovereasonable. Ourstudyhasseverallimitations.Onecould,forinstance, view the inclusion criterion as a limitation, \"experience inresource orientation\", for example, was not further defined.An imbalance of gender representation may also be under- s t o o da sal i m i t a t i o n .H o w e v e r ,o u ra i mw a sn o tt od r a w conclusions on a representative basis, but to explore therespectiveGPs'personalinsightsonresourceorientation.Theremoteinterviewmethodhassomelimitationsregardingthecreation of an atmosphere of trust. However, this approach w a sc h o s e np u r p o s e f u l l yt ob ea b l et oi n c l u d eG P sf r o m around Germany, with an awareness of the bias that canarise from this method [ 23]. A further limitation could be that no definition of resource orientation was given to theparticipants before the interviews. This method was chosenin order to prevent bias regarding the meaning of the words\"resource orientation.\" Furthermore, the interviewees werenot asked to what extent they implement resource-orientedmethods, but rather how they would do so. This study doesonlyconsiderGPs,whichseemstogivealimitedviewofthesubject. To broaden and enhance the results of this study, the next step would be to interview patients as well as other healthprofessionalsandtoanalyzethegeneratedhypothesesinfurtherquantitativestudies. 5. Conclusion Resource orientation, as a part of health promotion, playsan important role in GPs' daily work. Therefore it shouldbe increasingly taken into account. Furthermore, resourceorientation should be focused in medical curricula as wella si nd a i l yw o r kr o u t i n eo fG P sa n do t h e rh e a l t hp r o -fessionals. Resource-oriented skills could, for example, betaughtincommunicationclassesorqualitycircles.Moreover,GPs should be more integrated in communal structures.With regard to the demographic development this can con-tribute to respond the growing demand of health care andthe increasing workload and burden within primary care.Additionally, the duty of the patients is to become aware of8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine their resources. They need to take over direct responsibility for their health and health related problems which couldlead to a better quality of life and self-efficacy of patientsespeciallythosewithchronicconditions.Inthisway,resourceorientation could lead to a reduced demand of medicalservicesand,thus,toareductionofGPs'workload.
