This document is designed to set forth the policies and procedures of the AT Program . It is intended to enhance, clarify, and supplement (not replace) those of the University, School , and Graduate School of USC . I. AT Program Description The USC AT Program is housed in the Department of Exercise Science in the Arnold School of Public Health. The USC AT Program has been accredited through the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE) since 199 6. The USC AT Program provid es students with theoretical knowledge and understanding of the athletic training profession in the context of larg er healthcare and its current procedures and techniques in sports injury management. Students gain this knowledge through required coursework and clinical experiences as they prepare to make successful contributions to the athletic training profession. The program combines formal classroom instruction and clinical experiences in a process that culminates in the student graduating with eligibili ty to sit for the Board of Certification (BOC) examination. Students who graduate from the program and subsequently pass the BOC examination will be qualified to be employed as an athletic trainer in a variety of health care setting s. BOC Certification To become certified as an AT, the ATS (athletic training student) must graduate from an accredited athletic training program and pass the BOC examination. Students enrolled in the USC Athletic Training Program (AT Program) must meet BOC requirements to apply. Please visit the Board of Certification website (www.bocatc.org ) for additional information. II. AT Program Mission, Vision, Goals, and Objectives Mission The mission of the MS in Athletic Training program is to: 1) provide interdisciplinary approaches to medicine through designed clinical educational experiences for students in various settings and interactions with different healthcare professionals. 2) teach students to access, interpret, and integrate relevant research into their clinical decision -making through didactic and clinical education that focuses on evidence -based medicine . 3) enhance the professional development of students through community engagement and recognize the athletic trainer's role as a healthcare pro vider within the larger context of a changing healthcare system. Vision The University of South Carolina Athletic Training Program's vision is to achieve prominence as an innovator in integrating interdisciplinary education /practice , research, evidence -based practice, and community engagement. The Program will advance the profession of athletic training, our community of learners, current and future athletic training leaders, health -related outcomes, and healthcare policy at all entries of practice. 6 USC AT Program Goals 1.

USC AT Program Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion The University of South Carolina and its athletic training program are committ ed to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) , focusing on belonging and social justice. USC believes DEI is necessary to achieve academic and institutional excellence. At USC, \"every student, faculty , and staff member not only matters, but their unique perspectives are the core of our strength and success\". The USC Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion websit e: https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/diversity_equity_and_inclusion/index.php The ASPH Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion website: https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/public_health/internal/faculty_staff/administrative_departments/diversity/i ndex. php Inclusive Excellence Policy [credit to Central Michigan AT Program] The USC AT program integrates concepts of cultural competency, cultural humility, and respect in client/patient care throughout the didactic and clinical components of the program. The university, the USC AT program will strive to create an environment that enhances the underlying principles and stated policies of affirmative action, diversity, and equ itable access for all . We will not discriminate or judge based on one's ability, age, color, ethnicity , gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information, familial status, height, marital status, mental health status, national origin, political persuasion, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status, or weight exc ept where such a distinction is required by law or institutional policy . Students may have specific needs relative to their protected classes in terms of practice and observance . The USC AT program will work with students on a case -by-case basis to reasona bly accommodate . Admission and matriculation in the USC AT program will be contingent upon the student's verification that they understand and meet the program's technical standards , with or without accommodation s of their protected status . (See USC AT pro gram technical standards ) If a student indicates a potential issue and need for any accommodation to meet USC AT program requirements, the Athletic Training Program Director , and/or Clinical Education Coordinator, in conjunction with university officials a nd the appropriate Athletic Training faculty, will review and determine if USC AT program requirements can be met with reasonable accommodations. The review will assess student/patient safety, as well as the educational standards of the AT program/institut ion, including coursework and clinical education requirements. 8 AT Program DEI statements for all AT course syllabi. Diversity and Inclusion The university is committed to a n inclusive, safe, and respectful campus environment for all persons, and one that fully embraces the Carolinian Creed. To that end, all course activities will be conducted in an atmosphere of friendly participation and interaction among colleagues, recognizing and appreciating each student's unique exper iences, background s, and point s of view . Students and faculty are always expected to apply the highest academic standards to the course and treat others with dignity and respect. Accessibility, Disability, and Triggers [credit to Dr. David Moscowitz] I am committed to ensuring course a ccessibility for all students. If you have a documented disability and expect reasonable accommodation to complete course requirements, please notify me at least one week before accommodation is needed. Please also provide SDRC (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/ ) documentation to me before requesting accommodation. Likewise, if you are aware of cognitive or emotional tr iggers that could disrupt your intellectual or mental health, please let me know so I can be mindful of the course content. Diversity, Ethics, and the Carolinian Creed [credit to Dr. David Moscowitz] This course works to foster a climate free of harassmen t and discrimination, and it values the contributions of all forms of diversity. The decision to enter university and pursue advanced study is a choice that entails a commitment to personal ethics expressed in the Carolinian Creed ( www.sa.sc.edu/creed ): \"I will discourage bigotry while striving to learn from differences in people, ideas , and opinions.\" Likewise, the Student Code of Conduct (STAF 6.26 ( http:/ /www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/staf626.pdf ) stresses, \"The University of South Carolina strives to maintain an educational community that fosters the development of students who are ethical, civil and responsible persons.\" Title IX and Gendered Pronouns [credit to Dr. David Moscowitz] This course affirms equality and respect for all gendered identities and expressions. Please do not hesitate to correct me regarding your preferred gender pronoun and/or name if different from what is indicated on the official class roster. Likewise, I am committed to nurturing an environment free from discrimination and harassment. Consistent with Title IX policy, please be aware that as a responsible employee, I am obligated to report information you provide about a situation invo lving sexual harassment or assault . Values [credit to Dr. David Moscowitz] Two core values, inquiry , and civility, govern our class. Inquiry demands that we all cultivate an open forum to exchange and substantiat e ideas. When you see an opportunity, striv e to be creative, take risks, and challenge your conventional wisdom. Civility supports our inquiry by demanding ultimate respect for the voice, rights, and safety of others. Threatening or disruptive conduct may result in course and/or university dismissa l. Civility also presumes basic courtesy: please be well rested, on time, and prepared for class, which includes time for a restroom stop before (not during) the course and silencing all personal devices. Additional DEI Education and Training for students and faculty Sexual Misconduct T raining One of the ways we ensure that we maintain a professional environment free from harassment and discrimination is through required AT program sexual harassment training at the beginning of the school year. The Assista nt 9 Vice President for Civil Rights and Title IX/Title IX & ADA Coordinator provides training on these issues for our students. In addition, t he Civil Rights and Title IX offer mandatory Harassment and Discrimination Prevention Training required at the Univ ersity of South Carolina for all university employees system -wide. It covers the university policies, laws , and procedures that address unlawful discrimination and harassment. All incoming graduate students must complete community education training cours es as part of their registration process . The three required training courses are Sexual Assault Prevention, Mental Well -Being, and Diversity, Inclusion , and Belonging. The training can be located at this website: https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/graduate_school/new_students/community_education_courses/ IV.

Students DO NOT need to apply to the graduate school at the University of South Carolina. The Director of Graduate Student Services in the Arnol d School of Public Health will transfer all information from ATCAS into the USC Graduate School system. The Arnold School of Public Health will only import verified applications to the University of South Carolina. This means that all admission requirement s must be met before student applicant files will be reviewed. Admission Requirements The following requirements must be submitted and verified by ATCAS for admission to the MS in AT: Bachelor of Science degree from an accredited institution o Submit officia l transcripts from ALL schools attended (not just those in which a degree was earned) to ATCAS. Applications in ATCAS will not be screened or reviewed until all official transcripts are received and verified. o After an admission decision is made, all offic ial transcripts must be submitted to the University of South Carolina Graduate School before students are eligible to enroll . This is in addition to the transcripts submitted to ATCAS. This is also required for students who graduate from the University of South Carolina. o International applicants may also be required to submit transcript evaluations from WES. Minimum GPA of 3.0 from the undergraduate degree For international applicants, a satisfactory score on the Test of English as a Foreign Language 11 (TOEFL ) - minimum score of 80 internet -based, 230 computer -based, or 570 paper -based - or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic Course Type 2 exam - minimum overall band score of 6.5.

Questions related to meeting AT program course requirements should be made to the AT profe ssional program director \u2014Dr. Mensch ( jmensch@mailbox.sc.edu ). The AT program admission committee will review all petitions pertaining to pre -requisite course requirements . Any successful petition related to pre -requisite course requirements will result in automatic admission with conditions. Academic Advisement All students in the MS in Athletic Training are advised by the AT Program Director (Dr. Mensch). Students' progress through the curriculum as a cohort. Individual advisement meetings occur with Dr. Mensch during the last few weeks of each semester. If you have any questions after reviewing the Athletic Training admissions information or this handbook, you may call the Office of Graduate Student Services a t 803 -777-5031 or the graduate director Dr. Mensch at 803 -777-3846. 12 Academic Progression (GPA Requirement) Graduate courses may be pa ssed for degree credit with a grade as low as C, but a degree -seeking student must maintain at least a B (3.00 on a 4.00 scale) cumulative grade point average . No grade below a (C) will count on a MS in AT program of study and if a student receives a grade lower than a C, the class must be retaken prior to matriculating to additional AT courses. The sequencing of classes in the AT curriculum are meant to build on previous content , and therefore students may not progress with their cohort if they receive a grade below a C in any AT program course. Students will be required to sit out and join the next cohort the following year unless it is a non -AT related course such as PUBH 700/PUBH 678. Programs may cancel a student's registration privilege if the student fails to make adequate progress toward the degree defined by the program's academic policies. A student's registration privileges may be canceled for failure to meet academic standards defined by The Graduate School. Academic Suspension Policy Graduate degree -seeking students whose cumulative grade point average (GPA) drops below 3.00 ( B) will be placed on academic probation by The Gradua te School and allowed one calendar year in which to raise the cumulative GPA to at least 3.00. In the case of a conversion of grades of incomplete that cause a cumulative GPA to drop below 3.00, a degree -seeking student will be placed on academic probation at the end of the semester in which the grade is posted. Students whose cumulative GPA falls below the required minimum of 3.00 by receiving a grade for a course in which they received a grade of Incomplete will, instead of a one -year probationary period, be granted only one major semester of probation dating from the semester in which the Incomplete conversion grade is received by the registrar in which to raise their cumulative GPA to 3.00 or above. Students who do not reach a cumulative 3.00 grade point average during the probationary period will be suspended from graduate study and will not be permitted to enroll for further graduate coursework as a degree or non-degree student. Colleges, schools, and/or departments may have a more stringent policy than The Graduate School's academic suspension policy. Students are also responsible for knowing program policies. AT Program Attendance Policy The USC AT program attendance policy aligns with the Graduate School (See entire policy at: https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/graduate/policies -regulations/graduate -academic -regulations/#text Students in the AT program are expected to meet all academic objectives as defined by the course instructor. Students are responsible for completing all assigned work, to attend all class meetings from the beginning of the semester, and participating in class. The AT program and USC aim to ensure the highest academ ic standards while recognizing that events occur beyond the personal control of students or faculty. Different courses demand different approaches to assessing student attendance and participation. AT program faculty will provide students with a specific a ttendance policy in their class syllabus by the first day of class. Students are responsible for satisfying the requirements for attendance and participation for any class in which they are enrolled, including requirements for notification and documentatio n of excused absences. This policy applies to all AT courses, including synchronous or asynchronous online courses. 13 The University of South Carolina is required by law to excuse absences from class for the following reasons: 1. Performance of a military du ty or obligation imposed by state or federal law, as documented in writing by the appropriate state or federal authority. 2. Legal obligation to appear at or participate in a judicial /administrative proceeding, including the performance of jury duty, as docum ented in writing by the appropriate judicial /administrative authority. 3. Any medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth, as documented by the student's health care provider, requiring the student's absence from class. 4. A disability, as defined by th e Americans with Disabilities Act and as documented by the Student with the Student Disability Resource Center, which prevents the student from attending class. 5. Observance of a religious practice, holiday or holy day, if the instructor of the class is prov ided written notification by the student of their intent to observe such religious practice, holiday or holy day no later than the end of the second week of regularly scheduled classes in a full fall or spring semester term, and within twice the length of the drop/add period for any other term. Any other absences required to be excused by applicable state or federal law. The University of South Carolina requires that absences from class for the following reasons must also be excused: 1. Participation in an au thorized University activity, in which the student plays a formal, required role. Such activities include but are not limited to, musical performances, academic competitions, and varsity athletic events. University documentation of participation should be provided in advance of the absence. 2. Illness or injury that is too severe or contagious for the student to attend class, with appropriate documentation. 3. Death or severe illness of an immediate/dependent family member, with appropriate documentation. 4. Univers ity closure for weather -related or other emergencies. Instructors, at their discretion, may also excuse absences from class for the following reasons: 1. Non-closure weather -related emergencies that affect a student's capacity to reach campus or that require a student's presence off -campus. 2. Mandatory interviews related to employment, professional school, or graduate school that cannot be rescheduled. 3. Any other situation deemed excusable by the instructor. Instructors are encouraged to show understanding towar d students' needs while remaining mindful of the University's high academic standards and the need to be scrupulously even -handed. Clinical Education opportunities and AT Program attendance: The AT Program will work with students to identify clinical sites that will help them enhance their clinical skills and abilities. However, all immersive clinical experiences must be associated with one of the AT Program's clinical education courses (ATEP 713 & ATEP 715). Although the AT Program approves and sets up all clinical sites for students; it is possible some clinical experiences may flow into the academic semesters; and students will miss in -person classes. These unique situations will be handed on a case -to-case basis using the following guidelines: 14 The cours e instructors of the affected academic classes need to be the first level of communication. Students must notify and meet with all individual instructors to grant permission to miss class during this absence. If faculty are willing to work with students, t he student is responsible for making up any missed work or assignments and will be required to meet all course deadlines, regardless of if they are excused from attending class in -person. (Note: faculty are not required to provide a virtual option for students to participate in class). Students should prioritize clinical education experiences outside of academic class time when possible. Students should also attempt to create clinical hours schedule that minimizes conflicts with academic class time. The AT faculty will consider up to 3 weeks of class time to be missed for clinical immersive experiences that impede into an additional summer/fall/spring academic semester. The time will be based on the total class meeting time for each specific course and may n ot be more than the equivalent of 3 -weeks based off the 16 -week traditional fall/spring academic calendar. (Summer semester equivalent will be determined) Once approval is given by the course instructor, the clinical education coordinator, program direct or, and course instructors will meet and produce a plan on a case -by-case basis. Each situation is different and will be judged accordingly based on multiple factors, including the location and quality of the clinical site, the academic standing of the stu dent, and course exams and assignments. Students missing more than the allotted time for any reason (excused or unexcused) will be subject to grade reduction up to and including failure of the class. AT Professional Classroom Behavior Policy The Universit y of South Carolina Athletic Training Program is committed to fostering an environment in the classroom and labs that promotes academic success for all students and instructors. Athletic training students should conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times. At no time should students engage in disrespectful behavior and communication verbal and non -verbal towards classmates. Inappropriate and unacceptable behaviors that demonstrate disrespect for others or a lack of professionalism will not be tolerated. It is unacceptable for students to demonstrate a lack of professionalism and respect for the value system of others in the classroom, lab, or at any point during their AT education. Examples of unprofessional behaviors (not an inclusive list) are Violations of the NATA Code of Ethics, BOC Standards of Professional Practice, and The Carolinian Creed, as well as disturbing class, using electronic devices in an inappropriate manner, and disrespectful behavior and/or communication (verbal and non -verbal). Anyone (including classmates, faculty, staff, clinical preceptors, general public) may report a student for lack of professional behavior to the AT program director, clinical education coordinator, AT faculty, EXSC department chair, or other resource s where the individual feels comfortable, such as the office of student conduct and academic integrity or office of civil rights and title IX. (see links below). If possible, and when behavior is directly observed by faculty, faculty are encouraged to inte rvene to stop the behavior, address pertinent issues immediately . https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_conduct_and_academic_integrity/ index.php https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/civil_rights_title_ix/ 15 Violations of Behavior Policy Any violation of the professional behavior code of cond uct outlined above could be grounds for dismissal from the classroom, lab, and/or USC Athletic Training Program. All cases will be handled on an individual basis by an AT Program committee made of at least 3 faculty and may include classroom instructor, st akeholder, Director of Athletic Training Programs, Professional AT Program Director, Clinical Education Coordinator, AT Program Faculty, and Chair of the EXSC Department. Graduate Student Assistance & Appeal Process The policies and regulations of the Univ ersity of South Carolina serve as purposeful guidelines and standards for students as they pursue degree objectives. Occasionally, individual students may feel they have grounds to seek exception from the uniform application of such regulation and policies . Graduate students may file written grievances, appeals or petitions to the Office of Faculty Affairs and Curriculum seeking to reverse or modify decisions made at a lower level of authority. Resolution of any written grievance must follow the procedures outlined in policies maintained by the USC Division of Student Affairs and Academic Support. More information on Arnold School of P ublic Health Student Grievance Website. On the Columbia Campus, the Graduate Student Ombuds serves as a confidential, neutral, informal, and independent resource for graduate students' concerns and conflicts. https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/graduate_school/opportunities_support/ombuds/index.php 16 V.

The award is $750 ($250/semester) and will provide in -state tuition for the program's Summer, Fall, and Spring terms of Year 1. Admis sion into the program does not guarantee in - state tuition. Applications submitted after November 15 have a decreased likelihood of consideration. We recommend all non -residents apply by the November 15 priority deadline for Fellowship consideration. The a ward is not renewable; however, i nternational students are eligible to be considered for an AT Fellowship for Year 2 of the program as they cannot obtain South Carolina Residency. All other students must review the South Carolina residency policy with the University Registrar. The program does not guarantee in -state tuition for Year 2, and individuals who do not qualify for in -state tuition but are US residents are not eligible for the AT Fellowship in Year 2. If you are unsure about your current SC residen cy status, please see the link for more information. https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/resid ency_and_citizenship/residency/residency_requi rements/index.php Eligibility: All applicants must have an application verified through ATCAS, complete an interview with the USC AT Admissions Committee (comprised of faculty, staff, and Ph.D. students), and be offered unconditional admittance into the AT program. The AT Program has limited AT fellowships, and the number of awards given may vary yearly based on budget considerations. Process: After an applicant has received an offer to join the professional AT program from the Program Director, the Admissions Committee will calculate a score using objective data and criteria from the ATCAS application. The applicant will not need to submit any additional materials for consideration of the award. All non -resid ent admitted students will autonomically have a Fellowship score (rubric below) calculated to determine eligibility. Criteria for Consideration: The Fellowship score will be calculated using the objective data below: Overall GPA (provided on ATCAS applica tion*) Science GPA (provided on ATCAS application*) Average Reference Rating Score (provided on ATCAS application) Average Admissions Committee Interview Score *Applicants who have an updated GPA following their ATCAS application submission can submit the ir updated verified GPA to Dr. Mensch for Fellowship consideration . Decisions: After completing the rubric, admitted students who score 21 -25 will automatically be offered an AT Fellowship on a rolling basis up to the maximum number of available fellowship s following the early decision deadline (November 15). If the number of qualified applicants exceeds the number of available fellowships, a ranking order will be used based on the interview round and rubric score. Individuals offered a Fellowship will have three weeks to accept their offer to join the program and accept their fellowship. If the deadline passes, the offer of a Fellowship will be removed, but an offer to join the program will still be supported. We will continue to offer Fellowships throughou t this process to qualified applicants as available. If fellowships still remain following the February 15th application deadline, all remaining fellowships will be offered to non -residents who scored a 20 or below using a ranked order OR individuals who w ere unable to accept the initial fellowship offer during the early admittance period. These offers will be good for two weeks with the same process of the Fellowship expiring, but the offer to join the program is still supported. Questions: All questions about AT Fellowships should be directed to Dr. Mensch at (803) 777 -3846 or the email above. Please visit the graduate school website for information on fellowships, awards, grants, an d other funding opportunities. 19 USC Athletic Training Fellowship Rubric Student Name_________________________________ 1.

This is a requirement for graduation. The make -up of comprehensive assessments will vary from progr am to program. The USC AT program has created a comprehensive assessment that aligns with the mission of the program, specifically enhancing professional development and integrating evidence -based medicine. This assessment will be based on content and skil ls from courses/clinicals that build over each semester in the program (see conceptual framework in Appendix G). To meet the final comprehensive assessment for the AT program, each student is required to submit some form of research for dissemination at a professional conference, workshop, journal, or other approved venue by the research advisor (acceptance is NOT a requirement). Framework Summer 1st year ATEP 701 Principles of Evidence -based Medicine Students learn the foundation of EBM Fall 1st year ATEP 711 Clinical Experiences in Athletic Training I Students are required to create and present a Critically Appraised Topic paper and present in class. Builds off of content from ATEP 701 Spring 1st year ATEP 749 Evaluation & Therapeutic Intervention of Head, Neck, Spine, and Abdomen Injuries Students are required to create and present a Disablement model case study paper Builds off of content from ATEP 730 Behavior Health and Wellness, specifically patient -centered care Summer 2nd year ATEP 713 Clinical Exper iences in Athletic Training III Students are required to find a professional conference or journal that accepts research submissions. Students are required to identify submission guidelines and create an abstract for submission, as well as a poster for pre sentation. Fall 2nd year ATEP 741 Advanced Clinical Skills in Athletic Training Students are required to complete an evidence to practice review Spring 2nd year ATEP 715 Clinical Experiences in Athletic Training V (clinical immersion) Students are require d to demonstrate they have completed the AT Program comprehensive assessment (submission of their work for publication or presentation) . Demonstration of submission of a CAT paper, disablement model, case study, evidence to practice or another approved wor k by a student is required by May 1st. 23 VII. AT Clinical Education All students enrolled in the USC AT Program receive a clinical assignment starting in the fall of their first year in the AT program . Students will then be enrolled in a clinical education course in 5 consecutive semesters (ATEP 711, 712, 713, 714, 715 \u2014See Appendix G for conceptual framework ). Students on academic probation are not eligible to participate in clinical education rotations. To graduate from the USC AT Program, all students mus t complete a minimum of five semesters of specific clinical experiences. All athletic tra ining students must complete the majority of their clin ical education experiences under the dire ct supervision of a preceptor who is an athletic trainer and in good st anding with the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control . Clinical assignments are available through USC men's & women's athletics, USC campus recreation, local high schools, sports medicine clinics, youth sports , physical therapy clinics, and sma ll colleges. Students must provide their own transportation t o all clinical education sites . The final clinical course (ATEP 715) is a clinical immersion experience that can be done anywhere. Students will meet with the Clinical Education Coordinator (Dr. Fraley ) and work together to find an immersive experience that meets all CAATE requirements and the student's professional goals. Required Clinical Education Experiences : Individual sports Team sports Sports requiring protective equipment Patients of diff erent sexes Non-sport patient populations A variety of conditions other than orthopedics Clinical Education Assignments The Clinical Education Coordinator (CEC) oversees the clinical education experiences of all athletic training students. Athletic trainin g students will be assigned to clinical assignment based upon a variety of factors which include , but are not limited to , the following: previous experience and clinical assignments, clinical experiences needed prior to anticipated program completion, indi cated professional practice preferences, clinical proficiency and competency, professional responsibility and dependability, extracurricular activities, part-time employment, academic performance, class schedules, and other factors as felt to be pertinent by the Athletic T raining Program faculty. Clinical Evaluation and Assessment Clinical Integrated Proficiencies & Competencies What are Clinical Competencies/Clinical Integrated Proficiencies? Clinical Competencies are the common set of athletic training sk ills/proficiencies used for curriculum development and education of CAATE -accredited athletic training programs. They also serve as a guide for development of educational experiences leading to BOC certification. The competencies/clinical integrated profic iencies identify knowledge and skills to be mastered within an entry -level athletic tra ining program. USC AT Program clinical competencies are integrated into didactic and clinical courses within the curriculum. The ATS must demonstrate mastery of competen cies to Pre ceptors and course instructors. 24 When do I complete Clinical Competencies/Clinical Integrated Proficiencies? Completion of all clinical competencies/proficiencies is a graduation requirement for t he athletic training program. No student will be allowed to progress through the USC AT Program or receive a clinical assignment until the previous competency requirements are completed. Failure to complete the assigned competencies/ proficiencies will result in failing the clinical course and program pr obation . Cognitive and psychomotor competencies will be instructed and assessed in the academic portion of the program via lecture, laboratory settings, and written and/oral practical examinations. Clinical proficiencies will be assessed during both academ ic and clinical portions of the athletic training program. All students will be assigned a preceptor who will evaluate clinical competencies and proficiencies through the semester. How do I complete Clinical Competencies/Clinical Integrated Proficiencies? Students will be required to complete all clinical integration proficiencies under the direct supervision of a Preceptor. As part of the clinical experience a preceptor will evaluate individual athletic training students on their ability to perform assess ments associated with this course. CIP sheets are uploaded into Evalue . This evaluation will be done online through that system. There will be a hard copy in the course Black Board (just for your reference). But you must use the Evalue system to get signed off by your preceptor (there will be NO hard copy). You MUST score a 3 (Exemplary) or 2 (Proficient) on the evaluation of any Clinical Integration Proficiencies. If you score a 1 (Developing) or 0 (Not Competent) on any of the Clinical Integration Profic iencies, the athletic training student will need to be reassessed on by the Preceptor on a date that does not coincide with the original assessment date. It is the responsibility of the student to complete all of the Clinical Integration Proficiencies by t he end of the semester. Any Clinical Integration Proficiencies left incomplete or not assigned a score of 3 (Exemplary) or 2 (Proficient) will result in the athletic training student receiving a \"Fail\" for that required grade for this course. A grade of \"F ail\" will result in a maximum grade of a D in the course (you will NOT graduate). It is the athletic training student's responsibility to provide a model for each Clinical Integration Proficiency that requires a physical demonstration. Use Evalue system!! Students are expected to take an active role in becoming proficient in all clinical skills . The student is responsible for learning the information and practicing the skills required to demonstrate competency in all clinical skills. * Clinical competency checklists can only be signed by Precep tors affiliated with the USC AT Program in the Evalue system .* Clinical Evaluation by Preceptor The athletic training student's performance will be evaluated at mid -term and at course completion by the Preceptor that they are assigned. This performance evaluation is an online assessment tool (you must use Evalue system for all evaluations). You will receive information emails through Evalue, as well as reminders. Any student who does not have completed clinical educat ion experience evaluation will have their grade automatically lowered to a D. Failure to receive a C or higher will prohibits students to continue in the AT Program course sequence, and the student will have to retake the course (you will NOT graduate). An y questions or concerns regarding clinical experiences should be directed to your Preceptor and Clinical Education Coordinator or Dr. Mensch. This evaluation will be a part of the student's grade in their corresponding c linical class. Assessment Rubric Used for Clinical Evaluation: 25 Proficient 2 The ATS has performed at a level of quality that meets or exceeds standards according to entry level benchmarks and indicators of a certified athletic trainer. Developing 1 The ATS has begun to perform at a level of quality that is necessary to meet the standards according to entry level benchmarks and indicators of a certified athletic trainer (Some Improvement Neede d prior to final signature ). Unacceptable 0 The ATS has not performed at a level of quality that is necessary to meet the standards according to entry level benchmarks and indicators of a certified athletic trainer (Improvement needed prior to final signature) . Evaluation of Precep tor and Clinical Education Site Students are required to evaluate their Preceptor and their clinical site at the conclusion of every semester. Clinical Education Experience Hours Policy The athletic training student Clinical Education Experience Hours Policy was created to ensure that students, faculty, and preceptors all follow the same guidelines in accordance with accreditation standards. This policy outlines the minimal and maximal amount of clinical experience hours students are expected to complete as part of their clinical course requirements. Each student partic ipating in ATEP 711, 712, and 714 must complete a minimum of 12 hours and a maximum of 30 hours of supervised field experience every whole week in the clinical environment they are assigned. A full week is defined as any week where the university has sched uled 5 full days of class. The AT Program establishes that a one -week period runs from Sunday to Saturday. Students participating in clinical immersion clinicals ATEP 713 and ATEP 715 must complete a minimum of 30 hours and maximum of 60 hours of supervise d field experience every whole week in the clinical environment they are assigned . See specific course syllabus for more information. Athletic training students must document clinical education experience hours during their rotation. At the conclusion of the month, all clinical education hours will be verified for the minimum/maximum of required clinical education hours. If an athletic training student is unable to achieve the minimum required hours or exceeds the maximum contact hours in a week, they must complete the Contact Hour Discrepancy Form and have it signed by their Preceptor. The AT Program Director may accept clinical education hours below the minimum requirement or above the maximum contact hours a week for extraneous factors that are not contr ollable by the athletic training student. Documentation of Clinical Education Experience forms and Contact Hour Discrepancy forms are available on the AT Program Blackboard site and must be turned in for each month that class is in session, by the 5th of the following month. It is the responsibility of the student to make time in their schedule to attend the clinical education site or event as scheduled by the AT Program Clinical Education Coordinator. Athletic training students must keep track of their cl inical hours using the Evalue system portal. The Preceptor (supervisor of the clinical education site that you are assigned) is responsible for verifying the completed hours by approving the hours you complete in the Evalue system WEEKLY. They will also si gn off on Evalue at the conclusion of each month. The course instructor may accept clinical education hours below the minimum require d hours per week for extraneous factors that are not controllable by the athletic training student. If the student is unabl e to attain required hours in a given week, a clinical hour discrepancy sheet must be submitted into the Evalue online system at the end of that particular week. If you do not complete the minimum clinical hours each week in the semester, or fail to submit your hours discrepancy in Evalue, you will receive a D for the class. Failure to receive a C or higher will 26 prohibits students from continuing in the AT Program course sequence, and the student will have to retake the course. An y students that are found t o have violated a policy of the AT Program while completing a clinical education experience can have their clinical education hours invalidated for that period of time. The invalidation of these hours could result in the student failing to meet the minimum number of required clinical education hours the clinical setting in which they are assigned. Requirements for Clinical Education Hours How to Report Clinical Hours It is the student's responsibility to record and report all clinical hours into the Evalue system. Clinical education hour log must be approved by Preceptor s and are due on the 5th of every month to the Clinical Education Coordinator through the Evalue system . Students should make a copy of all clinical education hour log sheets. Students will record one hour for each hour they a re in the athletic training facility working or engaged in athletic training activity. Partial hours are recorded to the nearest 1/4 of an hour. When rounding to the nearest \u00bc hour, you must work 8 minutes or more of th e \u00bc hour to round up. If you work less than 8 minutes of the \u00bc hour, you should round back. When traveling on a road trip, only actual hours spent working in athletic training activities can be recorded (hours to and from the site or hours spent in a motel are not acceptable) . Hours That Do Not Count toward USC AT Program Requirements Hours not completed under the direct observation of a USC Preceptor. Hours spent traveling (team travel, lodging, etc.). However, while traveling, hours spent giving treatment and those spent at the competition and practice sites will count if under the direct supervision of a USC Preceptor. Hours spent at clinical education sites not affiliated with the USC AT Program . Supervision of AT Program Students Direct Supervision When instructing and evaluating clinical proficiencies, the Preceptor must be physically present, including \"constant visual and auditory interaction\". This ensures that the Preceptor can int ervene on behalf of the student and the patient . In the event that P receptor is not physically present (e.g., bathroom, phone call, evaluating another athlete), a student may only apply first aid skills ( e.g., RICE, splinting, activate EMS , CPR) in an injury situation. VIII. Clinical Education General Information Employme nt during Clinical Assignments The AT student should expect a considerable time com mitment at their clinical site. Students are expected to follow the schedule of their clinic al assignment. It is the responsibility of the student to discuss their schedule with their Preceptor prior to the start of their clinical assignment. Any outside employment schedules must not conflict with clinical expectations and requirements. 27 Clinical Education Attendance /Punctuality The clinical education experience allows AT stu dents to implement, practice, and de skills vital to their success as athletic training professionals. These experiences are provided in the form of clinical assignments (both on and off campus) with an assigned Preceptor and are a required portion of the student's educational experience. A student enrolled in the AT Program is required to attend and actively participate in scheduled/assigned clinical experiences. Therefore, all athletic training students will be required to attend and be actively involved in AT Program clinical experiences as assigned. Understandably, there will be times when absences cannot be pre -approved (illness, family emergency, etc.). These will be dealt with at the discretion of the Program Director. It is the student's responsibil ity to communicate with all appropriate instructors and staff when these instances do arise. Again, the student should make every effort in advance of the absence to follow this notification procedure. Athletic training students are encouraged to provide a dvance notice to their supervising Preceptor . Clinical Education Availability and Punctuality recommendations: Arrive at practice at least 30 minutes or more as indicated before the beginning of practice and remain until all post -practice activity is comp lete or until dismissed. When anticipating arriving late, call immediately. Students should be where assigned on time or early. If anything, be five minutes early. Be ready to participate when entering the facility. Look for something to do before sitting and talking. When unable to make an assigned duty, call one of the staff athletic trainers or your group leader in advance where arrangements can be made to cover your absence. If unable to attend a practice, game, etc. or assigned sport, advance notice mu st be given to the staff. Clinical Education Rules and Guidelines General Rules a) Profanity, horse play, or similar actions are unacceptable to the allied health care professional and will not be tolerated. b) All rules of the NCAA and SEC governing vars ity practices, events, or competitions are to be followed by the athletic training students. c) Schedule all personal appointments away from athletic training facility and clinical hours. d) Personal business should not be conducted in the athletic trainin g facility. e) No student is allowed to use a modality without specific instructions from a preceptor and the student having demonstrated competency with the modality. f) Appropriate emergency procedures are discussed and demonstrated with each new student . Visiting Teams All visiting teams are to be treated with proper courtesy and respect. Re member these athletes and staff are our guests. We should meet their needs as much as possible. Once an athlete is injured, we are all on the 28 same team. Hopefully, if our guests are treated properly here, they will reciprocate the same attitude and availability when we visit them. Travel Athletic training students are to abide by the respective rules of their assigned varsity sport when traveling on a road trip with th eir assigned clinical rotation. They should be ready to go if requested by a staff athletic trainer to accompany them on the trip . Athletic training students are to adhere to all travel regulations that apply to that team. AT Student Clinical Requirements (Must Complete): 1) Emergency Cardiac Care certificat ion must be completed every other year . Course must provide adult and pediatric CPR, AED, 2nd Rescuer CPR, Airway Obstruction, and Barrier Devices (e.g., pocket mask, bag valve mask). Acceptable ECC provid ers are those adhering to the most current International Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiac Care. The two most common courses tha t meet these requirements are: a ) CPR/AED for the Professional Rescuer through the American Red Cross, and b) BLS through the American Heart Association. 2) Annual documented completion of Blood Borne Pathogen (BBP) training. Athletic Training Student Code of Conduct Appropriate Behavior Athletic training students are expected to uphold the Code of Et hics of the NATA. Students are encouraged to review the NATA Code of Ethics (Appendix A), BOC Standards of Professional Practice (Appendix B), and The Carolinian Creed (Appendix C). Preceptors reserve the right to dismiss students from their clinical site for inappropriate behavior. AT students are expected to follow the guidelines for personal conduct established by the USC AT Program and their clinical site . Any behavior deemed embarrassing to the USC AT Program, University of South Carolina, or clinical site would qualify as inappropriate behavior. Use of alcohol is prohibited during all USC AT Program clinical experiences , including travel. Inappropriate Behavior Policy at Clinical Education and USC Affiliated Sites The University of South Carolina Athle tic Training Program is committed to fostering an environment that promotes academic success for students and instructors at all clinical education sites . Athletic training students should conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times. At no tim e should they engage in conduct that would undermine their patients' confidence or cause a conflict of interest in their patients' care. Inappropriate and unacceptable behaviors that demonstrate disrespect for others or a lack of professionalism will not b e tolerated. Inappropriate relationships include but not limited to those with patients, supervisors, preceptors, coaches, and staff in the clinical education setting can be detrimental to patient care and the learning process. If a pre -existing relationsh ip is present, it is the athletic training student's responsibility to inform the Program Director and Clinical Education Coordinator as soon as possible after receiving clinical site assignments and before reporting to that clinical site for an educationa l experience. The Clinical Education Coordinator will re -assign the athletic training student to a different clinical assignment to avoid any detriment to patient care and student learning. All USC Preceptors and clinical education sites have the right to dismiss students from their clinical site for inappropriate or unacceptable behaviors. 29 Violations for inappropriate and unacceptable behaviors could result in failure of clinical education courses (ATEP 711, 712, 713, 714, 715 ) as well as dismissal from t he clinical education site and/or athletic training program . All reported cases will be handled on an individual basis by the AT Program Disciplinary Committee. If you have any questions regarding inappropriate relationships and behaviors in the clinical e ducation setting, please contact the Program Director and/or Clinical Education Coordinator . Athletic Training Student Relationships The AT student comes in contact with other members of the Athletic Department and the public quite often. It is helpful to know the limits of this contact in order that some unfortunate circumstances can be avoided. Following are brief guidelines to use in dealing with others during your assigned activities. Athletic Training Students to Faculty and Staff Athletic Trainers The staff athletic trainer is the ultimate authority in the athletic training facility. The staff athletic trainers' orders/requests are to be carried out as promptly as possible and not to be passed to subordinates. It is perfectly acceptable to ask question s of a staff athletic trainer about anything pertinent. Ask, do not challenge, in front of patients/athletes. If there are any grievances, they are to be directed to the Staff Athletic Trainer, Head Athletic Trainer, or Director of Athletic Training and Sp orts Medicine where the appropriate course of action will be decided upon. The Graduate Assistant Athletic T rainers are members of the staff . Athletic Training Students to Team Physicians The medical director or team physicians are the ultimate medical aut hority at the University. Always follow the physician's directions explicitly. Whenever you are accompanying a student athlete to an on -site visit with a physician, always accompany the student athlete into the examination, be attentive, and be able to inf orm the athletic training staff on the status of the student athlete or their injury. Remember, these physicians are extremely busy, they may run behind schedule or seem abrupt at times, but they are vital to the performance of our jobs and should be treat ed with respect at all times. Athletic Training Students to Athletic Director The Athletic Director has the ultimate responsibility for all aspects of the athletic program and reports directly to the University president. If the Athletic Director asks you a question about an athlete or their injury, refer the Athletic Director to the staff athletic trainer.

Clinical Immersion additional requirements One of the primary goals of the USC AT program is to provide interdisciplinary approaches to medicine through designed clinical educational experiences for students in a variety of settings and interactions with different health care professionals. The AT program encourages to seek out new clinical opportuni ties/sites for their immersion experience in unique places where athletic trainers can make a difference. These clinical sites often align with student professional goals and provide great learning environments where ATS can grow and develop. However, thes e clinical sites may have additional requirements that selected clinical sites by the AT CEC may not have, including (but not limited to) criminal background checks, drug tests, Covid tests, etc. Clinical immersion sites chosen by the student that require additional requirements/accommodations are done so at the expense of the ATS. The AT program is not responsible for additional expenses associated with a clinical immersion site that is chosen by the student . All students have the opportunity to be placed at a clinical immersion site by the CEC where these things are not required or are already provided by the USC AT program. Educational Expenses provided by Clinical Immersion Sites Students are able to be compensated for their clinical immersion educatio nal experiences. Compensation can include things such as a stipend, meal allowance, housing allowance, and/or salary. Educational compensation is only available during immersive clinical experiences where all students are afforded the same opportunity . Students are prohibited from obtaining these expenses during non -immersive clinical experiences . If a student or preceptor has any questions pertaining to supplementation to ATS, please contact the USC AT program director and/clinical education coordinator . Violations of Code of Conduct Any violation of the professional behavior code of conduct outlined above in the clinical education policies could be grounds for dismissal from a clinical education site and/or the AT program. Preceptors reserve the right to dismiss any athletic training student from their clinical assignment for any violation of clinical site rules and regulations. Students on academic probation are not eligible for a clinical assignment/rotation. All cases 34 will be handled on an individual ba sis by an AT Program committee made of at least 3 faculty and may include preceptors, other stakeholder s, Director of Athletic Training Programs, Professional AT Program Director, Clinical Education Coordinator, AT Program Faculty, and Chair of the EXSC De partment. Graduate Student Assistance & Appeal Process The policies and regulations of the University of South Carolina serve as purposeful guidelines and standards for students as they pursue degree objectives. Occasionally, individual students may feel they have grounds to seek exception from the uniform application of such regulation and policies. Graduate students may file written grievances, appeals or petitions to the Office of Faculty Affairs and Curriculum seeking to reverse or modify decisions mad e at a lower level of authority. Resolution of any written grievance must follow the procedures outlined in policies maintained by the USC Division of Student Affairs and Academic Support.

Any accidental injury or occupational disease sustained by the athletic training student outside of AT Program sanctioned clinical education experiences WILL NOT be covered. Receiving Medical Treatment The athletic training student must receive medical treatment for work related injuries at the medical 37 facility designated for your campus. At USC Columbia, this is the Thomson Student Health Center located behind the Russell House on Greene Street. If the injury occurs when the designated facility is closed, or if the injury is serious, athletic training students in Columbia should go to the Palmetto Health Richland Emergency Room. Athletic training students that are outside of Columbia should go to emergency room nearest their location. Active Communicable and Infectious Disease Policy The University of South Carolina Athletic Training Program has determined 4 distinct parts to the Active Communicable and Infectious Disease Policy: 1. Immunization Policies Athletic training student s must provide immunization documentation to the Athletic Training Program in concordance with the AT Program Immunization Policy . This includes those immunizations/screenings required for attendance at the University of South Carolina and USC AT Program c linical education sites. The costs of immunizations and screenings shall be incurred by the student. Students interested in the Athletic Training Program at the University of South Carolina are encouraged to obtain their own Hepatitis B immunizations prior to the start of their first year in the program. The cost shall be incurred by the student. Students will submit documentation of their Hepatitis B immunizations with their application to the Athletic Training Program. If a student so desires, he/she may decline by signing the appropriate form and submitting it to the Athletic Training Program with their application. Additional information on the Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis B immunizations, as well as the Informed Consent/Refusal Form, is available in the AT Program Hepatitis B Immunization Policy . 2. Annual Bloodborne Pathogen Training Athletic training students must complete annual formal bloodborne pathogen training prior to beginning at their fall clinical education site. Students must complete the Uni versity of South Carolina online training for bloodborne pathogens and submit their completion certificate to the program. 3. Exposure Control Plan The U SC AT Program will also provide athletic training students with an Exposure Control Plan in the event of exposure to bloodborne pathogens. This plan is available to students on Blackboard and will be readily available and immediately accessible at all clinical education sites. A T students will also have access to and will consistently use bloodborne pathogen b arriers and proper sanitation at all clinical education sites. 4. Illness If an athletic training student is ill, the student will report to Student Health Services (803 -777-3175) or a physician of his or her choice. The physician will determine the appropria te treatment and the amount of time the student will be absent from clinical activity. If the student has a communicable disease, the student will notify the Clinical Education Coordinator and Preceptor as soon as possible via phone or e -mail. Any student displaying signs and symptoms of a communicable disease and running a fever above 100 degrees will be asked to leave the clinical site and see a physician. Students are responsible for notifying the Office of Student Affairs and Academic Support (803 -777-4172) if they contract a communicable and/or contagious disease that presents a significant degree of health risk to other members of the University community. 38 Immunization Policy Athletic training students must provide immunization documentation to the Ath letic Training Program in concordance with the AT Program Immunization Policy. This includes those immunizations/screenings required for attendance at the University of South Carolina and USC AT Program clinical education sites. The costs of immunizations and screenings shall be incurred by the student. Students are required to have the immunizations required by the University for admissions into the institution, including: 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and a meningococcal vaccine for student s 21 and under. These requirements can be found at https://www.sa.sc.edu/shs/imm/immunizations/. Students in the Athletic Training Program at the University of South Carolina are also encouraged to obtain their own Hepatitis B immunizations prior to the s tart of their first year in the program. Students must submit documentation stating they have initiated or completed the 3 -part series of the Hepatitis B vaccination, or provide appropriate documentations opting out of the Hepatitis B vaccination to the At hletic Training Program. In addition, students must also submit annual documentation of a negative tuberculosis test. On occasion, some clinical education sites may also require a student to receive an annual influenza vaccination, in which documentation m ust be provided to the clinical education site. Hepatitis B Immunization Policy Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver which may be caused by several viruses, one of which is Hepatitis B. The Hepatitis B virus has been detected in almost all body fluids and secretions including blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, breast milk, tears, and urine of someone infected with Hepatitis B. Although contact with infected blood is the most common way in which the virus is transmitted, it can also pass through cuts, scrapes, or breaks in the skin or mucous membrane. A carrier of Hepatitis B is someone who may or may not show signs of liver disease, but who continues to carry the Hepatitis B virus in the body and, therefore, can transmit it to others. A Hepatitis B vi rus infection may be mild or more severe . Death is uncommon in the early stages of infection. Chronic infection develops in 6 -10 percent of patients who become carriers. This chronic infection may last for years, possibly for life, and it may lead to cirrh osis and liver cancer. There is not a treatment or drug available that can kill the Hepatitis B virus . In most cases the body's own defense mechanism will eliminate the infection . In health care workers, the risk of acquiring Hepatitis B is determined main ly by their degree of exposure to blood. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for persons at high risk of contracting Hepatitis B. It will not prevent Hepatitis caused by other agents such as Hepatitis A virus or Hepatitis non A, non B virus. Hepatitis B Imm unization should be withheld in the presence of: Any serious active infection except when a physician believes withholding the vaccine entails a greater risk. Hypersensitivity (allergy) to yeast or any components of the vaccine (alum, thermasola mercury derivative, aluminum hydroxide, formaldehyde). Pregnancy or breast feeding. Severe heart/lung problems Hepatitis B vaccine is generally well -tolerated . As with any vaccine there is the possibility that broad use of the vaccine could reveal adverse reactions not observed in clinical trials . There may be a local reaction at the injection site such as soreness, pain, tenderness, itchiness, redness, black/blue mark, swelling, and warmth or nodule formation . Other reactions may include low grade fever, fever over 102 degrees (uncommon), general 39 arthralgia or rash neurological disorder. The vaccine consists of three injections . The first dose is at an elected time, the second dose one month later, and the third dose six months after the first dose . Full i mmunization requires three doses of the vaccine over a six-month period to confer immunity . However, the duration of the protective effects of the Hepatitis B Vaccine is presently unknown and the need for boosters is not yet defined. Students enrolled in t he Athletic Training Program at the University of South Carolina are encouraged to obtain their own immunizations prior to the start of their first year in the program . The cost shall be incurred by the student . If a student so desires, they may decline by signing the appropriate form and submitting it to the Athletic Training Program . Post -Exposure Evaluation and Follow -Up This protocol applies to all USC Columbia campus employees, student employees, apprenticeship students, and all other students who have exposure to human blood or body fluids. You may call a Student Health Services nurse on 803.777.3658 for any questions or additional information. Personal action required for needle sticks and other exposures to blood or body fluids: If possible, wash or flush the exposed area with soap and/or water immediately. Seek medical treatment as soon as possible after the incident. Be sure to inform clinical personnel that the injury is exposure to bloodborne pathogens and/or a needle stick. If possible, needles a nd other sharps should be placed in a puncture resistant container and given to the medical provider at the treatment facility . Document the routes of exposure and how the exposure occurred. Identify and document the source individual (unless the Universi ty can establish that identification is infeasible or prohibited by state or local law). During normal working hours: Monday -Friday, 8:00 am - 4:00 pm (excluding holidays) : o The exposed individual should immediately report to USC's Student Health Services for a confidential post -exposure evaluation and for assistance with any necessary referrals and appropriate follow -up care ( notification should be provided to the Student Health Nurse at 803 - 434-2479 ). Student Health Services is only equipped to provide m edical evaluations for low risk and minor exposure incidents. Higher risk and more significant exposure incidents will be referred to the Palmetto Health Emergency Department. After normal working hours and on week -ends and holidays: o Report to the Emergenc y Departme nt at Palmetto Health Richland Hospital. Those working out of town should seek treatment at the nearest hospital's emergency department. Workers' Compensation will cover athletic training students who experience a bloodborne pathogens exposure wh ile working on the job : Report the incident to your Preceptor and Clinical Education Coordinator as soon as possible but do not delay treatment . A USC incident report will need to be completed once treatment is initiated. Standard worker's compensation pap erwork will be completed for all employees experiencing occupational exposure. An exposure report must be competed for each incident. USC Columbia faculty and students should verify that USC's Student Health Services is provided an incident report and any medical evaluation records. 40 This report must include the date of the incident, person involved, and their supervisor, nature and consequences of the incident, root cause, and a description of the material/hazard involved. The entirety of the University o f South Carolina Athletic Training Program Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Plan can be found in Appendix E . Additional General Health and Safety Information is available in Appendix F . X.

Allegiance to these ideals requires each Carolinian to refrain from and discourage behaviors which threaten the freedom and respect every individual. Appen dix D. University of South Carolina Wellness Program: Alcohol, Drugs, and Health Scope Participation in the Wellness Program is required of all University of South Carolina student -athletes, including scholarship and non -scholarship student -athletes, and o ther students directly associated with the Athletics Department, including cheerleaders, athletic training students, and equipment managers (collectively referred to in this policy as \"student -athletes\"). 46 Policy Statement The Athletics Department is concerned about the potential use and abuse of drugs and alcohol by student - athletes at the University of South Carolina. This concern includes the use of illegal drugs, the use of anabolic steroids, the use of drugs that are not medically indicated, the misuse of prescription drugs, the use of alcohol, and the use of diuretics and \" masking agents\" designed to prevent the detection of such drug and alcohol use. The Athletics Department believes that drug and alcohol use and abuse, in addition to being a violation of team rules, poses a significant threat to the health, growth, develop ment and overall physical and mental well -being of its student athletes; results in diminished academic and athletic performance; increases the risk of injury to student -athletes and, in team sports, to their teammates and opponents; may retard the healing of injuries; and may produce dependence and addiction problems that can have devastating societal, financial and career ramifications. Therefore, the Athletics Department has adopted and implemented this Wellness Program, including a mandatory program of drug testing, education, and counseling, in an effort to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of student -athletes associated with the Athletics Department. Purpose The purpose of the Wellness Program is: 1. To educate student -athletes about the dangers an d effects of drug and alcohol use and abuse. 2. To identify through periodic and random testing those student -athletes who may be involved in drug and alcohol use and abuse. 3. To recommend and provide confidential assessment and treatment for those student -athletes identified as having drug or alcohol related problems. 4. To provide corrective actions for those student -athletes found in violation of the Wellness Program. Prohibited Substances The Wellness Program tests for substances identified by the Athletics Dep artment or the National Collegiate Athletics Association (\"NCAA\") as purporting to be performance enhancing or potentially harmful to the health, safety or well -being of student -athletes, or that are illegal under applicable federal or state law . Student - athletes are reminded they are responsible for the presence of any banned or illegal substance in their body, and are to refrain from areas of risk. Student -athletes are therefore prohibited from using the following substances: 1. Illegal drugs, including but not limited to, marijuana, phencyclidine, stimulants (e.g., amphetamines, ecstasy and cocaine), and LSD). 2. Anabolic steroids (e.g., Anavar and Dianabol) and similar growth enhancing or performance enhancing substances. 3. Prescription or o ver-the-counter drugs not medically indicated. 4. Drugs banned by the NCAA. 5. Diuretics and \"masking agents\" designed to prevent the detection of drug and alcohol use, not otherwise medically indicated. 6. Alcohol The Athletics Department reserves the right to mod ify the list of prohibited substances as it deems appropriate to meet the purposes of the Wellness Program. The NCAA's list of banned drugs may change during the academic year. An updated list may be found on the NCAA web site (www.ncaa.org). 47 Procedural Gu idelines 1. General The Athletics Department considers education to be the most important part of its Wellness Program. The Athletics Department will endeavor to educate its student -athletes about the risks inherent in drug and alcohol use and abuse. The Director of Wellness will be responsible for coordinating and making available to student - athletes drug and alcohol related educational programs, services and information throughout the year, including, for example: (a) programs for student -athletes, such as educational and motivational speakers that will provide necessary information to enable student -athletes to make decisions that will enhance and encourage a healthy lifestyle. (b) dissemination of information and materials available from campus and co mmunity resources regarding drugs, alcohol and tobacco, as well as materials related to general health and well -being; and (c) providing opportunities for student -athletes to discuss the health, legal and ethical risks of drug and alcohol use and abuse. 2. Annual Orientation Program At the beginning of each academic year, prior to the commencement of drug testing, all student -athletes will be required to participate in an athletics Department orientation program that will include presentations regarding the Wellness Program. Each student -athlete will receive a copy of the Wellness Program, and the drug testing procedures to be used by the Athletics Department will be explained in detail. All student -athletes will be required to sign a consent form acknowle dging their agreement to abide by the terms and conditions of the Wellness Program and granting the Athletics Department permission to perform drug tests at any time and to disclose test results to certain designated individuals. Student -athletes will be subject to drug testing in accordance with the Wellness Program at any time thereafter. 3. Drug Testing Procedure Drug testing will be conducted throughout the year, and student -athletes may be drug tested in -season, out -of- season, and during summer schoo l, if they are enrolled at the University of South Carolina. Student -athletes selected for testing will be required to provide a urine specimen for purposes of determining the presence or absence of prohibited substances.

University of South Carolina AT Program BBP Exposure Control Plan BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS EXPOSURE CONTROL PLAN Environmental Heal th & Safety The South Carolina Occupational Safety and Health standard on Bloodborne Pathogens, Subarticle 6, Section 1910.1030 requires an annual review of the exposure control plan. In addition, whenever changes in tasks, procedures, or employee positions affect, or create new occupational exposure, the existing plan must be reviewed and updated accordingly. The exposure control plan must be accessible to employees, as well as to OSHA and NIOSH representatives. The location of the plan may be adapt ed to the circumstances of a particular workplace, provided that employees can access a copy at the workplace during the work shift. If the plan is maintained solely on computer, employees must be trained to operate the computer. A hard copy of the exposur e control plan must be provided within 15 working days of the employee's request in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1020. MOST RECENT EXPOSURE CONTROL PLAN REVIEW DATE Name (Print) Signature Date Dr. Jim Mensch James Mensch June 25, 2018 POLICY The Athle tic Training Program is committed to providing a safe and healthful work environment for our entire staff. In pursuit of this goal, the following exposure control plan (ECP) is provided to eliminate or minimize occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.1030, \"Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens.\" 49 This program applies to all work operations in the Athletic Training Program where you may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials under normal working conditions or during an emergency situation . Copies of the program may be obtained from the Infectious Waste Manager, Amy Hand (Athletic Training Program Clinical Education Coordinator, 803) 777 -7175) , and located in Blatt 101A . This Exposure Control Plan will be reviewed and updated at least annually by Dr. Jim Mensch, Athletic Training Program Director, and whenever necessary to reflect new or modified tasks, and/or new or revised employee positions which affect occupational exposure . This ECP includes: Determination of employee exposure Implementation of various methods of exposure control, including: Universal precautions Engineering and work practice controls Personal protective equipment Housekeeping Hepatitis B vaccination Post-exposure evaluation and follow -up Communication of hazards to employees and training Recordkeeping Procedures for evaluating circumstances surrounding exposure incidents Implementation methods for these elements of the standard are discussed in the subsequent pages of this ECP. The purpose of this exposure control plan is to: Eliminate or minimize employee occupational exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials Comply with the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1030 SCOPE The plan applies to all employees who have or may have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM). Blood is defined as human blood, human blood components, and products made from human blood. Bloodborne Pathogens include any pathogenic microorganism that is present in human blood or OPIM and can infect and cause disease in persons who are exposed to blood containing that pathogen . Pathogenic microorganisms can also cause diseases such as hepatitis C, malaria, syphili s, babesiosis, brucellosis, leptospirosis, and viral hemorrhagic fever . Contaminated means the presence or the reasonably anticipated presence of blood or other potentially infectious materials on an item or surface. Contaminated Laundry means laundry which has been soiled with blood or potentially infectious materials or may contain sharps Contaminated Sharps means any contaminated object that can penetrate the skin including, but not limited to, needles, scalpels, and broken glass. 50 Decontamination means the use of physical or chemical means to remove, inactivate, or destroy blo odborne pathogens on a surface or item to the point where they are no longer capable of transmitting infectious particles and the surface or item is rendered safe for handling, use, or disposal. Engineering Controls are controls that isolate or remove the bloodborne pathogens hazard from the workplace. Exposure Incident is a specific eye, mouth, or other mucous membrane, non -intact skin, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that results from the performance of an employ ee's duties. HBV means hepatitis B virus HIV means human immunodeficiency virus Occupational exposure is defined as reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may resu lt from the performance of an employee's duties. Other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) is defined as the following: saliva fluids visibly contaminated with blood; along with all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids; unfixed human tissues or organs (other than intact skin); HIV -containing cell or tissue cult ures, organ cultures, and HIV - or HBV -containing culture media or other solutions; and blood, organs, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV. Parenteral is the piercing mucous membranes or the skin barrier through such events a s needlesticks, human bites, cuts, and abrasions. Personal Protective Equipment is specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee for protection against a hazard. Regulated Waste means liquid or semi -liquid blood or other potentially infectious ma terials; contaminated items that would release blood or other potentially infectious materials in a liquid or semi -liquid state if compressed; items that are caked with dried blood or other potentially infectious materials and are capable of releasing thes e materials during handling; contaminated sharps; and pathological and microbiological wastes containing blood or other potentially infectious materials. Research Laboratory is a laboratory that produces or uses research -laboratory -scale amounts of HIV or HBV. Source Individual is any individual, living or dead, whose blood or other potentially infectious materials may be a source of occupational exposure to the employee. Sterilize means the use of a physical or chemical procedure to destroy all microbia l life including highly resistant bacterial endospores. Universal Precautions is an approach to infection control . The concept of Universal Precautions, all human blood and certain human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, a nd other bloodborne pathogens. Work Practice Controls means controls that reduce the likelihood of exposure by altering the manner in which a task is performed. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION The Athletic Training Program Director, Dr. Jim Mensch (Blatt Physical Education Center 102, (803) 777 -3846), is responsible for implementation of this Exposure Control Plan (ECP). This ECP will be reviewed and updated at least annually by Dr. Jim Mensch and whenever necessary to reflect new or modified tasks, and/or new or revised employee positions which affect occupational exposure. Those employees who are determined to have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) must comply with the procedures and work practices outlined in this EC P. 51 The Athletic Training Program and all affiliated clinical education sites will provide and maintain all necessary personal protective equipment (PPE), engineering controls (e.g., sharps containers), labels, and red bags as required by the standard. The Supervisor of employees with occupational exposure to blood or OPIM will ensure that adequate supplies of the aforementioned equipment are available in the appropriate sizes. The Athletic Training Program will be responsible for ensuring that all medical actions required by the standard are performed and that appropriate employee health and OSHA records are maintained. Contact location/phone number: Blatt Physical Education Center 102, (803) 777 -3846 The Athletic Training Program Director, Dr. Jim Mensch, will be responsible for defining all personnel under their supervision with occupational exposure to blood or OPIM and ensuring training, documentation of training, and making the written ECP available to employees, OSHA, and NIOSH representatives. EMPLOY EE EXPOSURE DETERMINATION The following is a list of all job classifications within the department of Environmental Health and Safety in which employees may have occupational exposure: JOB FUNCTION TASK/PROCEDURE Athletic Trainer / Athletic Training Stude nt Administering first aid and/or responding to injuries UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS All employees will utilize Universal Precautions . Universal Precautions is OSHA's required method of control to protect employees from exposure to all human blood and OPIM. The term, \"Universal Precautions,\" refers to a concept of bloodborne disease control which requires that all human blood and certain human body fluids be treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV or other bloodborne pathogens. EXPOSURE CONTROL PLA N Employees covered by the bloodborne pathogens' standard receive an explanation of this ECP during their initial training session. It will also be reviewed in their annual refresher training. All employees may review this plan at any time during their wo rk shifts by obtaining a copy located in Blatt 102, in the Athletic Training Student Handbook on the University of South Carolina Athletic Training website, or on the USC Athletic Training Blackboard page. ENGINEERING CONTROLS Engineering controls and work practice controls will be used to prevent or minimize exposure to bloodborne pathogens. The supervisor for the department must annually consider and implement appropriate, commercially -available and effective engineering controls designed to eliminate or minimize exposure. The supervisor must solicit and document for this process input from non -managerial employees who are potentially exposed to injuries from contaminated sharps, materials from infectious waste or spill clean -up materials. Where occupatio nal exposure remains after institution of these controls, personal protective equipment shall be utilized . The specific engineering controls and work practice controls used are listed below: Athletic training faculty and students do not utilize contaminat ed sharps directly when performing their job duties . Sharps containers are kept in the Athletic Training Research Lab and affiliated clinical education sites in the event that a sharps device is needed. The above controls will be examined and maintained on a regular basis. The schedule for reviewing the effectiveness of the controls is as follows: 52 An infectious waste spill drill is conducted annually by Dr Jim Mensch . The drill involves an infectious waste spill scenario and provides an opportunity for d iscussion and input into how to handle the scenario best . The spill drill is attended by Athletic Training Program personnel who might be affected by a bloodborne pathogen spill . Action items identified by the spill drill are documented and resolved as soo n as possible . Spill drills and attendance is documented by the Athletic Training Program Director. The Athletic Training Program Director, Dr. Jim Mensch, is responsible for ensuring that these recommendations are implemented. WORK PRACTICES Facilities f or proper hand washing should be readily available in all areas where occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens is anticipated . Antiseptic hand cleansers in conjunction with clean cloth/paper towels or antiseptic towelettes are examples of acceptable alternatives to running water. However, when these types of alternatives are used, employees must wash their hands with soap and running water as soon as feasible. These alternatives are only acceptable at worksites where it is infeasible to provide soap a nd running water. The standard requires that all equipment that may be contaminated must be examined and decontaminated as necessary before servicing or shipping. If complete decontamination is not feasible, the equipment must be labeled with the required biohazard label which also identifies explicitly which portions of the equipment remain contaminated. In addition, the employer must ensure that this information is conveyed to the affected employees, the servicing representative, and/or the manufacturer, as appropriate, before handling, servicing, or shipping. In work areas where there is a reasonable likelihood of exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM), employees are not to eat, drink, apply cosmetics or lip balm, smoke, or han dle contact lenses. Food and beverages are not to be kept in refrigerators, freezers, shelves, cabinets, or on countertops where blood or OPIM. Mouth pipetting/suctioning of blood or OPIM is prohibited . All procedures shall be conducted in a manner which w ill minimize splashing, spraying, splattering, and generation of droplets of blood or OPIM. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) The responsibility for providing laundering, cleaning, repairing, replacing, and disposing of PPE at no cost to employees' rests with the Athletic Training Program. PPE is provided to employees at no charge . Training in the use of the appropriate PPE for specific tasks or procedures is provided by the Athletic Training Program faculty. PPE will be chosen based on the expected exp osure to blood or OPI materials. The PPE will be considered appropriate only if it does not permit blood or other potentially infectious materials to pass through or reach the employees' clothing, skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes under normal c onditions of use and for the duration of time which the PPE will be used. If laboratory jackets or uniforms are used to protect the employee's body or clothing from contamination, they will be provided at no cost by the employer. Long pants and closed toe shoes shall be worn when handling all infectious waste and while cleaning up any OPIM and/or blood spills. The types of PPE available to employees who may be exposed to blood or OPIM are as follows: gloves, eye protection, face protection, laboratory coat s All employees using PPE must observe the following precautions: Remove PPE after it becomes contaminated and before leaving the work area. A \"work area\" is generally considered to be an area where work involving occupational exposure occurs or where cont amination of surfaces may occur. Remove immediately or as soon as feasible any garment contaminated by blood or OPIM, in such a way as to avoid contact with the outer surface. Wash hands immediately or as soon as feasible after removing gloves or other PPE . 53 The use of eye protection would be based on the reasonable anticipation of facial exposure. Masks in combination with eye protection devices, such as glasses with solid side shields, goggles, or chin -length face shields, shall be worn whenever splashes, spray, spatter, or droplets of blood or OPIM may be generated and eye, nose, or mouth contamination can be reasonably anticipated. If disposable eye and/or face protection becomes contaminated, it will be disposed of with all other contaminated materials . If non -disposable eye and/or face protection becomes contaminated, these items will be decontaminated using a disinfectant in the work area. Gloves will be worn to protect hands from exposure to blood or OPIM. Gloves will not be worn outside contaminated areas . Gloves will be changed when contaminated or the integrity has been compromised. Gloves will be removed to wash hands when work with the hazards has been completed and before leaving the area . Only disposable gloves will be used for these duties. Appropriate gloves must be worn by employees while handling infectious waste and while cleaning up any OPIM and/or blood spills. Gloves must also been worn when it is reasonably anticipated that there may be hand contact with blood or OPIM, and when handling or touching contaminated items or surfaces. Replace gloves if torn, punctured or contaminated, or if their ability to function as a barrier is compromised. Utility gloves may be decontaminated for reuse if their integrity is not compromised; discard util ity gloves if they show signs of cracking, peeling, tearing, puncturing, or deterioration. Never wash or decontaminate disposable gloves for reuse. Wash hands immediately or as soon as feasible after removing gloves or other PPE. Used gloves will be dispos ed with other contaminated lab waste. Hypoallergenic gloves, glove liners, powderless gloves, or other similar alternatives will be readily accessible to those employees who are allergic to the gloves normally provided. Additional protective clothing such as lab coats, gowns, aprons, or similar outer garments will be worn in instances when gross contamination can be expected. Contaminated non -disposable lab coats will be deposited in the EHS laboratory to be laundered. These items will not be taken home by any employee . They will be laundered by a contracted facility. Contaminated disposable lab coats will be disposed of with the other contaminated lab waste. PPE may be obtained through the Supervisor . The supervisor will order required PPE and ensure thi s PPE is available to employees with potential occupational exposure to blood or OPIM. The supervisor will also ensure appropriate PPE in the appropriate sizes is readily accessible and issued without cost to employees . PPE supplies such as gloves will be stored in the Storage Room (Blatt 107A) . HOUSEKEEPING OSHA requires contaminated work surfaces to be cleaned with an \"appropriate disinfectant\". Appropriate disinfectants include a diluted bleach solution and EPA -registered tuberculocides (List B), ster ilants registered by EPA (List A), products registered against HIV/HBV (List D) or Sterilants/High Level Disinfectants cleared by the FDA, provided that such surfaces have not become contaminated with agent(s) or volumes of or concentrations of agent(s) fo r which higher level disinfection is recommended. The lists of EPA Registered Products are available from the National Antimicrobial Information Network on its web site at http://nain.orst.edu/ or at (800) 447 -6349 . The sterilant and high level disinfectants cleared by FDA can be found at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/germlab.html . The products listed above must be used by the manufacturer's instructions to be fully affective. If using diluted household bleach for disinfecting, it must be made up daily (every 24 hours). 54 The particular disinfectant used, as well as the frequency with which it is used, will depend upon the circumstances in which a given housekeeping t ask occurs (i.e., location within the facility, type of surface to be cleaned, type of soil present, and tasks and procedures being performed) . Most contaminated work surfaces will be decontaminated using a 10% dilution of household bleach in water (1:10 dilution). Cleaning procedures are listed below. Infectious waste is collected in either 96 gallon red wheeled carts or in lined boxes provided by the infectious waste vendor . The vendor will pick up full red wheeled carts and full lined boxes on a weekly basis. Once the vendor has taken the red wheeled cart back to the vendor's facility the cart will be decontaminated prior to returning to campus . When lined boxes are used for infectious waste, the vendor incinerates the boxes and provides new boxes and l iners as required . The carts and implements, used for picking up boxed infectious waste, do not come into contact with infectious waste. The infectious waste is boxed before it is placed on the cart . If the cart is accidentally contaminated, it will be cle aned with a solution of 10% bleach in water. When bins approach capacity (3/4 full), the Athletic Training Program contacts EHS for removal. REGULATED WASTE The Bloodborne Pathogens standard uses the term, \" regulated waste ,\" to refer to the following cate gories of waste which require special handling: (1) liquid or semi -liquid blood or OPIM; (2) items contaminated with blood or OPIM and which would release these substances in a liquid or semi -liquid state if compressed; (3) items that are caked with dried blood or OPIM and are capable of releasing these materials during handling; (4) contaminated sharps; and (5) pathological and microbiological wastes containing blood or OPIM. Regulated waste containers will be color -coded with the color red or orange to w arn all who may have contact with the containers of the potential hazard posed by its contents. The biological hazard symbol will be used to mark these containers as well . All containers must be labeled with the words \"infectious waste\", \"biological waste\" or \"medical waste\". All waste packages must also include a completed tag, filled out by laboratory personnel, and attached . Regulated waste shall be discarded immediately or as soon as feasible in containers that are: Closable; Constructed to contain all contents and prevent leakage of fluids during handling, storage, transport or shipping; Labeled or color -coded in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of the standard; and Closed prior to removal to prevent spillage or protrusion of contents during handlin g, storage, transport, or shipping. If outside contamination of the regulated waste container occurs, it shall be placed in a second container. The second container shall be: Closable; Constructed to contain all contents and prevent leakage of fluids durin g handling, storage, transport, or shipping; Labeled or color -coded in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of the standard; and Closed prior to removal to prevent spillage or protrusion of contents during handling, storage, transport, or shipping. OSHA doe s not generally consider discarded feminine hygiene products , used to absorb menstrual flow, to fall within the definition of regulated waste. The intended function of products such as sanitary napkins is to absorb and contain blood. The absorbent material of which they are composed would, under most circumstances, prevent the release of liquid or semi -liquid blood or the flaking off of dried blood. OSHA expects these products to be discarded into waste containers which are properly lined with plastic or wa x paper bags. Such bags should protect the employees from physical contact with the contents. 55 Sharps containers shall be maintained upright throughout use, replaced routinely and not be allowed to overfill. When removing sharps containers from the area of use, the containers shall be: Closed immediately before removal or replacement to prevent spillage or protrusion of contents during handling, storage, transport, or shipping; Placed in a secondary container if leakage is possible. The second container shal l be: o Closable; o Constructed to contain all contents and prevent leakage during handling, storage, transport, or shipping; and o Labeled or color -coded according to paragraph (g)(1)(i) of the standard. Reusable containers shall not be opened, emptied, or clea ned manually or in any other manner which would expose employees to the risk of percutaneous injury. Upon closure, duct tape may be used to secure the lid of a sharps container as long as the tape does not serve as the lid itself. Sharps containers must be easily accessible to employees and located as close as feasible to the immediate area where sharps are used (e.g., patient care areas) or can be reasonably anticipated to be found (e.g., laundries). During infectious waste pickups, the Infectious Waste H andlers will pick up sharps containers that have already been securely closed. The containers must be replaced by the laboratory requesting pickup. Regulated Waste Disposal Procedures: Full Sharps disposal containers will be discarded directly into the lar ge biohazard waste boxes with red bag liners for pick -up by Stericycle for incineration. Contaminated sharps are discarded immediately or as soon as possible in containers that are closable, puncture -resistant, leak proof on sides and bottoms, and appropr iately labeled or color -coded. Sharps disposal containers are conveniently accessible to the immediate area where sharps are used . If contaminated sharps are involved in the clean -up of a spill, they will be discarded in a sharps container. Reusable sharps will not be handled by Athletic Training Program students or employees. All other regulated biohazard waste generated in the labs will be autoclaved, by the laboratory personnel, before they are disposed of in the biohazard boxes which are located in the autoclave rooms . For box pickups , the infectious waste officer builds a box, inserts the red biohazard liner, and collects the infectious waste in a box . The box is then closed and taped shut . Each box collected is placed in the infectious waste cooler lo cated off Bull Street next to the second floor of Benson School. Any waste generated during the clean -up of a spill involving blood or OPIM will be discarded in a red biohazard bag and then disposed in the large biohazard boxes with other laboratory infect ious waste. Broken glassware that may be contaminated is only picked up using mechanical means, such as a brush and dustpan. NOTE: Disposal of all regulated wastes will be in accordance with applicable federal, state and local regulations. DHEC is the cont rolling agency in South Carolina. LAUNDRY Contaminated laundry means laundry which has been soiled with blood or other potentially infectious materials or may contain sharps. 56 Contaminated laundry shall be handled as little as possible with a minimum of ag itation. Contaminated laundry shall be bagged or containerized at the location where it was used and shall not be sorted or rinsed in the location of use. Other requirements include: Contaminated laundry shall be placed and transported in bags or container s labeled with the biohazard label or color -coded using red or orange to indicate contaminated material. It is the responsibility of the Infectious Waste Officer to ensure all contaminated laundry is handled properly. Whenever contaminated laundry is wet a nd presents a reasonable likelihood of soak -through or leakage from the bag or container, the laundry shall be placed and transported in secondary bags or containers which prevent soak -through and/or leakage of fluids to the exterior. The secondary bag or container must also be labeled with the above requirements. Employees who have direct contact with contaminated laundry must wear protective gloves and other appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Other appropriate PPE will be determined on a ca se-by-case basis. If contaminated laundry is shipped off -site to a second facility which does not utilize Universal Precautions in the handling of all laundry, contaminated laundry will be placed in bags or containers which are labeled or color - coded in a ccordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of the standard. Contaminated laundry is not generated within the EHS department. If clothing is contaminated with blood or OPIM, it will then be place in with infectious waste and that item will be replaced monetarily to the employee by the Environmental Health and Safety department. Contaminated laundry from other departments will also be included with infectious waste. Those items will be replaced by that department for the employee . Employees are not permitted to take their protective equipment home to launder, it is the responsibility of the EHS department to provide, launder, clean, repair, replace, and dispose of personal protective equipment. LABELS A warning label that includes the universal biohazard symbol (see 29 CFR 1910.1030(g)(1)(i)(B) followed by the term \"biohazard,\" must be included on bags/containers of contaminated laundry; on bags/containers of regulated waste; on refrigerators and freezers that are used to store blood or OPIM; and on bags/containers u sed to store, dispose of, transport, or ship blood or OPIM (e.g., specimen containers). In addition, contaminated equipment which is to be serviced or shipped must have a readily observable label attached which contains the biohazard symbol and the word \"b iohazard\" along with a statement relating which portions of the equipment remain contaminated. The labels must be fluorescent orange or orange -red or predominantly so, with symbols and lettering in a contrasting color. The label must be an integral part of the container or affixed as close as feasible to the container by a string, wire, adhesive, or other method to prevent its loss or unintentional removal. Red bags or red containers may be substituted for the biohazard labels; however, regulated wastes mus t be handled according to DHEC rules and regulations. Labeling is not required for: Containers of blood, blood components, and blood products bearing an FDA -required label that have been released for transfusion or other clinical uses; Individual containe rs of blood or OPIM that are placed in secondary labeled containers during storage, transport, shipment, or disposal; and Specimen containers, if the facility uses Universal Precautions when handling all specimens, the containers are recognizable as contai ning specimens, and the containers remain within the facility; and Regulated waste that has been decontaminated 57 The labeling requirements do not preempt either the U.S. Postal Service labeling requirements (39 CFR Part III) or the Department of Transportat ion's Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR Parts 171 -181). DOT labeling is required on some transport containers (i.e., those containing \"known infectious substances\"). It is not required on all containers for which 29 CFR 1910.1030 requires the biohaza rd label. Where there is an overlap between the OSHA -mandated label and the DOT -required label, the DOT label will be considered acceptable on the outside of the transport container provided that the OSHA -mandated label appears on any internal containers w hich may be present. Containers serving as collection receptacles within a facility must bear the OSHA label since these are outside the DOT requirements. The Infectious Waste Officer is responsible for ensuring that warning labels are affixed or red bags are used as required if regulated waste or contaminated equipment is brought into the facility. Employees are to notify Environmental Health and Safety if they discover regulated waste containers, refrigerators containing blood or OPIM, contaminated equip ment, etc., without proper labels. HIV AND HBV RESEARCH LABORATORIES AND PRODUCTION FACILITIES Academic HIV and HBV research laboratories are regarded as research laboratories under the standard. A research laboratory produces or uses research laboratory -scale amounts of HIV and HBV. Although research laboratories may not have the volume found in production facilities, they deal with solutions containing higher viral titers than those typically found in patients' blood. The standard covers animal blood only for those experimental animals purposely infected with HIV or HBV. Although the standard does not apply to animal blood unless it comes from an experimental animal infected with HIV or HBV, persons handling animals or animal blood should follow general pr ecautions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control/National Institutes of Health Publication, Biosafety in Microbiological a nd Biomedical Laboratories . EHS employees will not come into direct contact with any substance associated within these laboratories during their normal job duties. If out of scope work is needed within these laboratories, further steps will be taken for p rotection of EHS employees. Prior to any out of scope work is conducted the Biological Safety Officer and Safety Manager must be contacted. HEPATITIS B VACCINATION The hepatitis B vaccination series is available at no cost after initial employee training and within 10 days of initial assignment to all employees identified in the exposure determination section of this plan. Thus, arranging the first dose of the series be administered at a time which will enable this schedule to be met. Vaccination is encour aged unless: 1) documentation exists showing the employee has previously received the series; 2) antibody testing reveals the employee is immune; 3) medical evaluation shows that vaccination is contraindicated; or 4) the employee declines to have the vacci nation. Vaccination will be provided by the Student Health Services Immunization Clinic . If an employee declines the hepatitis B vaccination , EHS will ensure the employee signs a hepatitis B vaccine declination. The declination's wording is found in Appen dix A of the standard. Documentation of refusal of the vaccination is kept with the Infectious Waste Officer. Employees have the right to refuse the hepatitis B vaccine and/or any post -exposure evaluation and follow - up. Note, however, the employee will be properly informed of the benefits of the vaccination and post -exposure evaluation through training. The employee also has the right to decide to take the vaccination at a later date if they so choose . EHS must make the vaccination available at that time. EHS may not require an employee to take a pre -screening or post -vaccination serological test prior to receiving hepatitis B vaccination; however, it may be decided by the Safety Make to make pre -screening available at no cost to the employee. 58 All medical evaluations and procedures , including the hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination series, are to be provided according to the current recommendations of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS). According to the current guidelines, employees who have ongoing co ntact with patients or blood and are at ongoing risk for percutaneous injuries should be tested for anti -HBs one to two months after the completion of the three -dose vaccination series. Non - responders must receive a second three -dose series and be retested after the second series. Non -responders must be medically evaluated http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5011a1.htm . The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) does not recommend routine booster doses of hepatitis B vaccine, so they are not required at this time. However, if a regular booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine is recommended by the USPHS at a future date, such booster doses must be made available at no cost to those eligible employees with occupational exposure. Environmental Health & Safety and/or Student Health Services will provide training to employees on hepatitis B vaccinations, addressing safety, benefits, effic acy, methods of administration, and availability. POST -EXPOSURE EVALUATION AND FOLLOW -UP All exposure incidents must be reported, investigated, and documented. Should an exposure incident occur, contact Buddy Harley at the following number: office: 803-777-5255 or cell: 803-528-8191 . Personnel must also immediately report all exposure incidents to their immediate supervisor . Step-by-step instructions for how to handle post -exposure events are listed below and are also available in the Student Health Service s (SHS) General Medicine Clinic nurse's station . Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that staff are offered immediate medical care, appropriate diagnostics and treatment . An immediately available confidential medical evaluation and follow -up will be conducted. The exposed employee should immediately report to Student Health Services for a confidential post -exposure evaluation and for assistance with the referrals and appropriate follow -up care . If during business hours, and prior to sending the patien t, notification should be provided to the Student Health Nurse at 803 -434-2479 . For some lower risk incidents, provider consultation by phone may be sufficient with subsequent follow up at a later time. After business hours , the exposed employee should be sent to the Prisma Health Richland Emergency Department for evaluation, care and treatment . The General Medicine Center provider will call 803 -434-1663 and provide a full verbal report to a provider in the Emergency Department. Following initial first aid (clean the wound, flush eyes or other mucous membrane, etc.), the following activities will be performed: Document the routes of exposure and how the exposure occurred. Identify and document the source individual (unless the University can establish tha t identification is infeasible or prohibited by state or local law). Obtain consent and make arrangements to have the source individual tested as soon as possible to determine HIV, HCV, and HBV infectivity. Ensure two \"tiger -top\" blood tube specimens are drawn from the potential host patient . Each tube should be labeled with the date of the draw, host's name, date of birth and medical record number. Document the source individual's test results were conveyed to the employee's health care provider. If cons ent cannot be obtained and is required by state law, the employer must document in writing that consent cannot be obtained. Exposures from an unknown source will be managed based on specifics of the injury and the events surrounding the injury . These cases should still be considered worker's compensation cases and handled accordingly. If the source individual is already known to be HIV, HCV and/or HBV positive, new testing need not be performed. Assure the exposed employee is provided with the source indiv idual's test results and with information about applicable disclosure laws and regulations concerning the identity and infectious status of the source individual (e.g., laws protecting confidentiality). After obtaining consent, collect exposed employee's blood as soon as feasible after exposure incident, and test blood for HBV and HIV serological status 59 If the employee does not give consent for HIV serological testing during collection of blood for baseline testing, preserve the baseline blood sample for at least 90 days; if the exposed employee elects to have the baseline sample tested during this waiting period, perform testing as soon as feasible. Standard worker's compensation paperwork will be completed for all employees experiencing an occupational exposure. An exposure report must be completed for each incident. ADMINISTRATION OF POST -EXPOSURE EVALUATION AND FOLLOW -UP Student Health Services will ensure the health care professional(s) responsible for employee's hepatitis B vaccination, post-exposur e evaluation and follow -up are given a copy of OSHA's bloodborne pathogens standard. Student Health Services clinical staff and the exposed employee will ensure the health care professional who is evaluating the employee after an exposure incident receives the following: a description of the employee's job duties relevant to the exposure incident route(s) of exposure circumstances of exposure if possible, results of the source individual's blood test relevant employee medical records, including vaccina tion status The Employee Safety Manager must obtain and provide the employee a copy of the evaluating healthcare professional's written opinion within 15 days of completion of the evaluation. The healthcare professional's written opinion for hepatitis B is limited to whether hepatitis B vaccination is indicated and if the employee received the vaccination. The written opinion for post -exposure evaluation must include information that the employee has been informed of, the results of the evaluation and told about any medical conditions resulting from exposure that may require further evaluation and treatment. All other findings or diagnoses must be kept confidential and not included in the written report. The institution that provides medical services ( e.g., Student Health Services and/or the Palmetto Richland Memorial Hospital's Emergency Department) will provide the employee with a copy of the evaluating health care professional's written opinion within 15 days after completion of the evaluation. Post -expos ure counseling will be given to employees following an exposure incident. Counseling concerning infection status, test results and interpretation of all tests will assist the employee in understanding the potential risk of infection and in making decisions regarding the protection of personal contacts. For example, counseling should include USPHS recommendations about the transmission and prevention of HIV. These recommendations include refraining from blood, semen, or organ donation; abstaining from sexual intercourse or using measures to prevent HIV transmission during sexual intercourse; and refraining from breast feeding infants during the follow -up period. Counseling based on the USPHS recommendations must also be provided for HBV and HCV and other bloo dborne pathogens, as appropriate. Counseling will be made available regardless of the employee's decision to accept serological testing. PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING AN EXPOSURE INCIDENT EHS Safety Manager will review the circums tances of all exposure incidents to determine: if engineering controls were in use at the time work practices followed a description of the device being used (including type and brand) protective equipment or clothing used at the time of the exposure i ncident (gloves, eye shields, etc.) Location of the incident (O.R., E.R., patient room, etc.) procedure being performed when the incident occurred employee's training 60 All percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps will be recorded by the Employee S afety Manager in a Sharps Injury Log. EMPLOYEE TRAINING All employees who have occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens receive initial and annual training conducted by the Biological Safety Officer or Employee Safety Manager. NOTE: The Biological Sa fety Officer is responsible for providing training for research lab personnel handling human -derived research samples . The Safety Manager is responsible for providing training to personnel in non- laboratory work areas with occupational exposure to blood or OPIM. Academic programs that place students in work environments where the student may have an occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens are responsible for providing training to these students (see the \"Scope\" section of the ECP for additional traini ng guidance for academic programs). The supervisor is responsible for ensuring all personnel with occupational exposure that work under their supervision have completed required training. Training will be given at the time of initial assignment to tasks wh ere occupational exposure may occur, and it will be repeated within 12 months of the previous training. In addition, training must be provided when changes (e.g., modified/new tasks or procedures) affect a worker's occupational exposure. Part -time and temp orary employees are covered and are also to be trained on University time. The person conducting the training is required to be knowledgeable in the subject matter covered by the elements in the training program and be familiar with how the course topics a pply to the workplace that the training will address. The trainer must demonstrate expertise in the area of occupational hazards of bloodborne pathogens. All employees who have occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens receive training on the epidemiol ogy, symptoms, and transmission of bloodborne pathogen diseases. In addition, the training program covers, at a minimum, the following elements: a copy and explanation of the OSHA bloodborne pathogen standard an explanation of our ECP and how to obtain a copy an explanation of methods to recognize tasks and other activities that may involve exposure to blood and OPIM, including what constitutes an exposure incident an explanation of the use and limitations of engineering controls, work practices, and PP E an explanation of the types, uses, location, removal, handling, decontamination, and disposal of PPE an explanation of the basis for PPE selection information on the hepatitis B vaccine, including information on its efficacy, safety, method of adminis tration, the benefits of being vaccinated, and that the vaccine will be offered free of charge information on the appropriate actions to take and persons to contact in an emergency involving blood or OPIM an explanation of the procedure to follow if an e xposure incident occurs, including the method of reporting the incident and the medical follow -up that will be made available information on the post -exposure evaluation and follow -up that the employer is required to provide for the employee following an exposure incident an explanation of the signs and labels and/or color coding required by the standard and used at this facility an opportunity for interactive questions and answers with the person conducting the training session. RECORDKEEPING Training records are completed for each employee upon completion of training. These documents will be kept for at least three years . The Employee Safety Manager will maintain copies of the training roster for each Bloodborne Pathogens Training they provide. 61 The tr aining records include: -the dates of the training sessions -the contents or a summary of the training sessions -the names and qualifications of persons conducting the training -the names and job titles of all persons attending the training sessions Medic al records are maintained for each employee with occupational exposure in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1020, \"Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records.\" The medical record includes the name and social security number of the employee; a copy of the em ployee's hepatitis B vaccination status including the dates of all the hepatitis B vaccinations and any medical records relative to the employee's ability to receive the vaccination; copies of all results of examinations, medical testing and follow -up procedures; copies of the healthcare professional's written opinion; and copies of the information provided to the healthcare professional. Medical records will be kept confidential and are not reported or disclosed without the expressed written consent of the worker, except as required by the standard or as may be required by law. Student Health Services is responsible for maintenance of the required medical records. Student Health Services is also responsible for obtaining copies of these records for EHS empl oyees that are referred to other institutions for medical services. These confidential records are kept in the Student Health Services medical records for at least the duration of employment plus 30 years . If this department is closed or there is no succes sor employer to receive and retain the records for the prescribed period, the Director of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) will be contacted for final disposition. Employee medical records are provided upon request of the emp loyee or to anyone having written consent of the employee within 15 working days . Such requests should be sent to Student Health Services . Any employer who is required to maintain a log of occupational injuries and illnesses under OSHA's Recordkeeping regulation (29 CFR Part 1904) is also required to establish and maintain a sharps injury log for the recording of percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps. All work -related needlestick injuries and cuts from sharp objects that are contaminated with anoth er person's blood or other potentially infectious material (as defined by 29 CFR 1910.1030) will be recorded on the OSHA 300 Log . If an employee is splashed or exposed to blood or OPIM without being cut or punctured, the incident must be recorded on the O SHA 300 Log if it results in the diagnosis of a bloodborne illness or if it meets one or more of the recording criteria in 29 CFR 1904.7. An exposure incident is evaluated to determine if the case meets OSHA's Recordkeeping Requirements (29 CFR 1904). This determination and the recording activities are done by the Employee Safety Manager in Environmental Health and Safety. All percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps are also recorded in a Sharps Injury Log and must include at least: date of the inju ry type and brand of the device involved (syringe, suture needle) department or work area where the incident occurred explanation of how the incident occurred. This log is reviewed as part of the annual program evaluation and maintained for at least fi ve years following the end of the calendar year covered. If a copy is requested by anyone, it must have any personal identifiers removed from the report. All employee records will be made available to the employee or his representative in accordance with O SHA standard 1910.1020. All employee records will be made available to OSHA and the NIOSH under 1910.1020. 62 HEPATITIS B VACCINE DECLINATION (MANDATORY) I understand that due to my occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious mater ials I may be at risk of acquiring hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. I have been given the opportunity to be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, at no charge to myself. However, I decline hepatitis B vaccination at this time. I understand that by declini ng this vaccine, I continue to be at risk of acquiring hepatitis B, a serious disease. If in the future I continue to have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials and I want to be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, I can receive the vaccination series at no charge to me. Signed: (Employee Name ) Date: ________________ Appendix F . General Health and Safety Information Blood Borne Pathogens 2010 -2011 NCAA Sports Medicine Handbook, Eighteenth edition, July 2010, page 66 -72. Blood -borne pathogens are disease -causing microorganisms that can be potentially transmitted through blood contact. The blood -borne pathogens of concern include (but are not limited to) the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Infections with these (HBV, HIV) viruses have increased throughout the last decade among all portions of the general population. These diseases have potential for catastrophic health consequences. Knowledge and awareness of appropriate preventive st rategies are essential for all members of society, including student -athletes. The particular blood -borne pathogens HBV and HIV are transmitted through sexual contact, direct contact with infected blood or blood components, and perinatally from mother to b aby. In addition, behaviors such as body piercing and tattoos may place student -athletes at some increased risk for contracting HBV, HIV, or Hepatitis C. The emphasis for the student -athlete and the athletics health -care team should be placed predominately on education and concern about these traditional routes of transmission from behaviors off the athletics field. Experts have concurred that the risk of transmission on the athletics field is minimal. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) HBV is a blood -borne pathogen t hat can cause infection of the liver. Many of those infected will have no symptoms or a mild flu -like illness. One -third will have severe hepatitis, which will cause the death of one percent of that group. Approximately 300,000 cases of acute HBV infection occur in the United States every year, mostly in adults. Five to 10 percent of acutely infected adults become chronically infected with the virus (HBV carriers). Currently in the United States, there are approximately one million chronic carriers. Chronic complications of HBV infection include cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Individuals at the greatest risk for becoming infected include those practicing risky behaviors of having unprotected sexual intercourse or sharing intravenous (IV) needles in any form. There is also evidence that household contacts with chronic HBV carriers can lead to infection without having had sexual intercourse or sharing of IV needles. These rare instances probably occur when the virus is transmitted through 63 unrecognized -wound or mucous -membrane exposure. The incidence of HBV in student -athletes is presumably low, but those participating in risky behavior off the athletics field have an increased likelihood of infection (just as in the case of HIV). An effective vaccine t o prevent HBV is available and recommended for all college students by the American College Health Association. Numerous other groups have recognized the potential benefits of universal vaccination of the entire adolescent and young -adult population. HIV ( AIDS Virus) The Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which infects cells of the immune system and other tissues, such as the brain. Some of those infected with HIV will remain asymptomatic for many years. Others will more rapidly develop manifestations of HIV disease (i.e., AIDS). Some experts believe that virtually all persons infected with HIV eventually will develop AIDS and that AIDS is uniformly fatal. In the United States, adolescents are at sp ecial risk for HIV infection. This age group is one of the fastest growing groups of new HIV infections. Approximately 14 percent of all new HIV infections occur in persons aged between 12 to 24 years. The risk of infection is increased by having unprotect ed sexual intercourse and the sharing of IV needles in any form. Like HBV, there is evidence that suggests that HIV has been transmitted in household -contact settings without sexual contact or IV needle sharing among those household contacts. Similar to HB V, these rare instances probably occurred through unrecognized wound or mucous membrane exposure. Comparison of HBV/HIV Hepatitis B is a much more \"sturdy/ durable\" virus than HIV and is much more concentrated in blood. HBV has a much more likely transmiss ion with exposure to infected blood, particularly parenteral (needle -stick) exposure, but also exposure to open wounds and mucous membranes. There has been one well -documented case of transmission of HBV in the athletics setting among sumo wrestlers in Jap an. There are no validated cases of HIV transmission in the athletics setting. The risk of transmission for either HBV or HIV on the field is considered minimal; however, most experts agree that the specific epidemiologic and biologic characteristics of the HBV virus make it a realistic concern for transmission in sports with sustained close physical contact, such as wrestling. HBV is considered to have a potentially higher risk of transmission than HIV. Participation by the Student -Athlete with Hepatitis B (HBV) Infection Individual's Health --In general, acute HBV should be viewed just as other viral infections. Decisions regarding ability to play are made according to clinical signs and symptoms, such as fatigue or fever. There is no evidence that intense, highly competitive training is a problem for the asymptomatic HBV carrier (acute or chronic) without evidence of organ impairment. Therefore, the simple presence of HBV infection does not mandate removal from play. Disease Transmission \u2014The student -athlete with either acute or chronic HBV infection presents limited risk of disease transmission in most sports. However, the HBV carrier presents a more distinct transmission risk than the HIV carrier (see previous discussion of comparison of HBV to HIV) in spor ts with higher potential for blood exposure and sustained close body contact. Within the NCAA, wrestling is the sport that best fits this description. The specific epidemiologic and biologic characteristics of hepatitis B virus form the basis for the following recommendation: If a student -athlete develops acute HBV illness, it is prudent to consider removal of the individual from combative, sustained close -contact sports (e.g., wrestling) until loss of infectivity is known. (The best marker for infectivity is the HBV antigen, which may persist up to 20 weeks in the acute stage). Student -athletes in such sports who develop chronic HBV infections (especially those who are e -antigen 64 positive) should probably be removed from competition indefinitely, due to the small but realistic risk of transmitting HBV to other student -athletes. Participation of the Student -Athlete with HIV Individual's Health \u2014In general, the decision to allow an HIV positive student -athlete to participate in intercollegiate athletics should be made on the basis of the individual's health status. If the student -athlete is asymptomatic and without evidence of deficiencies in immunologic function, the presence of HIV infection in and of itself does not mandate removal from play. The team physici an must be knowledgeable in the issues surrounding the management of HIV -infected student -athletes. HIV must be recognized as a potentially chronic disease, frequently affording the affected individual many years of excellent health and productive life dur ing its natural history. During this period of preserved health, the team physician may be involved in a series of complex issues surrounding the advisability of continued exercise and athletics competition. The decision to advise continued athletics compe tition should involve the student -athlete, the student -athlete's personal physician, and the team physician. Variables to be considered in reaching the decision include the student -athlete's current state of health and the status of his/ her HIV infection, the nature and intensity of his/her training, and potential contribution of stress from athletics competition to deterioration of his/her health status. There is no evidence that exercise and training of moderate intensity is harmful to the health of HIV -infected individuals. What little data that exists on the effects of intense training on the HIV -infected individual demonstrates no evidence of health risk. However, there is no data looking at the effects of long -term intense training and competition at an elite, highly competitive level on the health of the HIV -infected student -athlete. Disease Transmission \u2014Concerns of transmission in athletics revolve around exposure to contaminated blood through open wounds or mucous membranes. Precise risk of such tra nsmission is impossible to calculate but epidemiologic and biologic evidence suggests that it is extremely low (see section on comparison of HBV/HIV). There have been no validated reports of transmission of HIV in the athletics setting. Therefore, there is no recommended restriction of student -athletes merely because they are infected with HIV, although one court has upheld the exclusion of an HIV -positive athlete from the contact sport of karate. Athletic Training Health -Care Responsibilities The following recommendations are designed to further minimize risk of blood -borne pathogens and other potentially infectious organisms' transmission in the context of athletics events and to provide treatment guidelines for caregivers. In the past, these guidelines we re referred to as \"Universal (blood and body fluid) Precautions.\" Over time, the recognition of \"Body Substance Isolation,\" or that infectious diseases may also be transmitted from moist body substances, has led to a blending of terms now referred to as \"S tandard Precautions.\" Standard precautions apply to blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions, except sweat, regardless of whether or not they contain visible blood. These guidelines, originally developed for health -care, have additions or modification s relevant to athletics. They are divided into two sections \u2014 the care of the student -athlete, and cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces. Care of the Athlete/Patient: 1. All personnel involved in sports who care for injured or bleeding student -athletes should be trained in first aid and standard precautions. 65 2. Assemble and maintain equipment and/or supplies for treating injured/ bleeding athletes. Items may include: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) [minimal protection includes gloves, goggles, mask, fluid -resistant gown if chance of splash or splatter]; antiseptics; antimicrobial wipes; bandages or dressings; medical equipment needed for treatment; appropriately labeled \"sharps\" container for disposal of needles, syringes and scalpels; and wast e receptacles appropriate for soiled equipment, uniforms, towels and other waste. 3. Pre-event preparation includes proper care for wounds, abrasions or cuts that may serve as a source of bleeding or as a port of entry for blood -borne pathogens or other poten tially infectious organisms. These wounds should be covered with an occlusive dressing that will withstand the demands of competition. Likewise, care providers with healing wounds or dermatitis should have these areas adequately covered to prevent transmis sion to or from a participant. Student -athletes may be advised to wear more protective equipment on high -risk areas, such as elbows and hands. 4. The necessary equipment and/or supplies important for compliance with standard precautions should be available t o caregivers. These supplies include appropriate gloves, disinfectant bleach, antiseptics, designated receptacles for soiled equipment and uniforms, bandages and/or dressings, and a container for appropriate disposal of needles, syringes, or scalpels. 5. When a student -athlete is bleeding, the bleeding must be stopped and the open wound covered with a dressing sturdy enough to withstand the demands of activity before the student -athlete may continue participation in practice or competition. Current NCAA polic y mandates the immediate, aggressive treatment of open wounds or skin lesions that are deemed potential risks for transmission of disease. Participants with active bleeding should be removed from the event as soon as is practical. Return to play is determi ned by appropriate medical staff personnel and/or sport officials. Any participant whose uniform is saturated with blood must change their uniform before return to participation. 6. During an event, early recognition of uncontrolled bleeding is the responsib ility of officials, student -athletes, coaches and medical personnel. In particular, student -athletes should be aware of their responsibility to report a bleeding wound to the proper medical personnel. 7. Personnel managing an acute blood exposure must follow the guidelines for standard precaution. Gloves and other PPE, if necessary, should be worn for direct contact with blood or other body fluids. Gloves should be changed after treating each individual participant. After removing gloves, hands should be wash ed. 8. If blood or body fluids are transferred from an injured or bleeding student -athlete to the intact skin of another athlete, the event must be stopped, the skin cleaned with antimicrobial wipes to remove gross contaminate, and the athlete instructed to wash with soap and water as soon as possible. NOTE: Chemical germicides intended for use on environmental surfaces should never be used on student -athletes. 9. Any needles, syringes or scalpels should be carefully disposed of in an appropriately labeled \"sha rps\" container. Medical equipment, bandages, dressings and other waste should be disposed of according to facility protocol. During events, uniforms or other contaminated linens should be disposed of in a designated container to prevent contamination of ot her items or personnel. At the end of competition, the linen should be laundered and dried according to facility protocol; hot water at temperatures of 71\u00b0C (160\u00b0F) for 25minute cycles may be used. 66 Care of Environmental Surfaces: 1. All individuals responsibl e for cleaning and disinfection of blood spills or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) should be properly trained on procedures and the use of standard precautions. 2. Assemble and maintain supplies for cleaning and disinfection of hard surfaces co ntaminated by blood or OPIM. Items include: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) [gloves, goggles, mask, fluid -resistant gown if chance of splash or splatter]; supply of absorbent paper towels or disposable cloths; red plastic bag with the biohazard symbol on it or other waste receptacle according to facility protocol; and properly diluted tuberculocidal disinfectant or freshly prepared bleach solution diluted (1:100 bleach/water ratio). 3. Put on disposable gloves. 4. Remove visible organic material by coverin g with paper towels or disposable cloths. Place soiled towels or cloths in red bag or other waste receptacle according to facility protocol. (Use additional towels or cloths to remove as much organic material as possible from the surface and place in the w aste receptacle.) 5. Spray the surface with a properly diluted chemical germicide used according to manufacturer's label recommendations for disinfection, and wipe clean. Place soiled towels in waste receptacle. 6. Spray the surface with either a properly dilu ted tuberculocidal chemical germicide or a freshly prepared bleach solution diluted 1:100, and follow manufacturer's label directions for disinfection; wipe clean. Place towels in waste receptacle. 7. Remove gloves and wash hands. 8. Dispose of waste according to facility protocol. Final Notes: 1.

Member institutions should ensure that policies exist for orientation and education of all health -care workers on the prevention and transmission of blood -borne pathogens.
