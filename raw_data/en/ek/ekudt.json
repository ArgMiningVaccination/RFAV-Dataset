Counsel for Defendant. Of Counsel: James H. Wallace, Jr., Esquire, Mark A. Pacella , Matthew J. Esqui re of Wiley Rein LLP. OPINION Dated: May 1, 2012 Wilmington, Delaw are~N I. INTRODUCTION This action arises out of the filing of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (\"ANDAs\") by Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (\"Mylan\") and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (\"Teva\") seeking to market generic versions of Tarceva\u00ae (erlotinib tablets), used to treat certain indications of non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. Plaintiff OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"OSI\") is the holder of approved New Drug Application (\"NDA'') No. 021743 for Tarceva\u00ae. OSI and plaintiff Pfizer, Inc. (\"Pfizer\") are owners of is a \"co- exclusive licensee\" of these patents, which are listed in the Food and Drug Administration's (\"FDA's\") publication titled \"Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations\" (known as the \"Orange Book\")1 for Tarceva\u00ae. (D.I. 54 at 1111 14, 19, 21) In December 2009, the '498 patent was reissued as U.S. Reissue Patent No. RE 41 ,065 (\"the RE '065 patent\"), which has been added to the Orange Book for Tarceva\u00ae. In February 2009, OSI and Pfizer received a letter from Teva notifying them that Teva had filed ANDA No. 91-059 with a Paragraph IV certification2 alleging that the '498, '221 and '613 patents are invalid, unenforceable, and/or not infringed by Teva's generic erlotinib hydrochloride tablets. (/d. at 1126) Shortly thereafter, also in February 2009, Mylan sent notice to OSI and Genentech that Mylan filed ANDA No. 91-002 with a 1The Orange Book must list \"each drug which has been approved for safety and effectiveness through an NDA.\" See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 the '498, '221 and '613 patents are invalid, unenforceable, and/or not infringed by Mylan's generic erlotini b hydrochloride tablets. (Id. at \u00b6 31) On March 19, 2009, plaintiffs filed Civ. Nos. 09-185 and 09-186, alle ging infringement of '613 by Teva and Mylan, respectively. The3 cases were consolida ted. In January 2010, after the issuance of t he RE '065 patent, plaintiffs filed an amended and supp lemental consoli dated complaint in Civ. No. 09-185, infringement of the RE by Teva and Mylan. ( Id.) Teva and Mylan brought counterclaims for noninfringement and for invalidity. (D.I. 56, 57) After the close of f act discovery, Teva moved to amend its pleadin gs to add the defenses of invalidi ty based on obviousness-type double -patenting; the court denied the motion. (D.I . 172, 213) A pr etrial conference was held March 3, 2011. Teva and Mylan conceded infringement of claims 1, 2, 4, 8, 34 and 35 of the RE '065 patent and claim 53 of the '221 patent. ( D.I. 198 at 2) On M arch 11, 2011, the court denied Teva' s motion for reconsideration of the court 's denial of its motion to amend. ( D.I. 218) A settlement was reached between plaintiffs and Teva on the eve of trial. (D.I . 222, 223) Mylan presented its invalidi ty defenses during a five-day bench trial commencing March 14, 2011. On June 30, 2011, t he court entered an order enj oining Mylan from launching its generic product until the court's decision issued. (D.I. 231) The validi ty issues have been fully briefed post-trial. (D.I. 232, 233, 234) The parties r epresent that the 30- See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)( A) (\"(2) It shall be an act of infringement to submit -3 (A) an application under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or described in section 505(b)(2) of such Act for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is clai med in a patent[.]\" ). 2month statutory stay expires \"on or 232 at 1; D.I . 233 at \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1338(a) and 1400(b). Having consi dered the documentary evidence and testimony, the court makes the followin g findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). II. FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONC LUSIONS OF LAW A. The Technology at Issue 1. EGFR and NSCL C 1. A discussion of the technology at issue is best framed by an overview of epidermal growth factor receptor ( \"EGFR\") and its role vis-a-vis cancer cells. EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in transmitting signals from the outside of a cell to the inside of a cell. In norm al cells, epidermal growth factor (or \" EGF\") binds to EGFR, which wil l cause a second EGFR or one of its family members together to bind to it, r esulting in the transfer of a phosphate to t he EGFR. This phosphorylation \"initiates a cascade of signalli ng events within the cell, leadi ng to increased survival and increased cell at 466:14-467:2) A EGFR tor is a small molecule that penetrates a cell, binds to t he catalytic portion of the kinase, and inhib its its enzymatic activity in tr ansferring a phosphate. ( Id. at 467:5-8) There are antib odies that bind to EGFR, that are not the subject of the patents in suit. (Id. at 467:18-23) 2. Receptor tyr osine kinease s are cancers,\" and \"[i]t been shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which possesses tyrosine kinase activity is mutated and/or overexpressed in many human cancers[.]\" (RE '065, col. 1:24-48) 3. There are t wo general types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (\"NSCLC\"), making up 80-85% of cases, and sm all-cell lu ng cancer (\"SCLC\"), which is about 10-15% of all lung cancers. (D.I. 227 at 806:18-24 (85%/15% r atio); DTX-365 at 365 of lung classified as NSCLC , and 10% have both small-cell and non- small cell elements)) NSCLC is further divided into three types: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. (D.I . 224 at 70:17-24) Doctors' classification of the cancer is important because NSCLC and SCLC have \"distinct morphology, genetics, biology below,5 differentiate m functional segments: the quinalone core (yellow); an anilin group linker substitution at t he 6,7-potisions with dimethox yethoxy tails (green). See gen. PubChem, erlotinib mary, 4(D.I. 233 at the hydrochloride salt. 3. '498 and RE '065 patents 5. The '498 patent was filed May 28, 1996 and issued May 5, 1998; it claims priority (as a continuation-in-part) to a PCT appli cation filed June 6, 1995. The RE '065 patent was issued on December 29, 2009, from a r eissue patent applica tion filed February 27, 2008. The patents, entitled \"Alkynl Azido-substituted 4- Anilinoquinazo lines,\" list Rodney Caug hren Schnur and Lee Danie l Arnold as inventors, and are assigned to OSI and Pfizer. As a r eissue patent, the RE '065 patent has an identical speci fication to the '498 patent. 6. The disclosed invention relates to compounds of t he formula I - and to pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which compounds are useful for 5treating hyperproliferative diseases, such as cancer. The \"R\" groups and \"n\" and \"m\" values are defined in the specificatio n. The invention also relates to processes of making the compounds of formula I and to methods of using them in t he treatment of disease. (RE '065 patent, abstract) The specification recites many preferred compounds according to the invention by chemical nomenclature, which for brevity's sake, will not be reiterated here. Erlotinib is identified as one of the specifically- preferred compounds. ( Id., col. 4:15-16) 7. As background, the patents pr ovide that 4-(substituted phenylamino) quinazol ine derivatives are useful in the treatment of cancers in mammals. ( RE '065 patent, col. 1:13-15) More specifically, it has been recognized that inhibi tors of receptor tyrosine kinases are useful as selective inhibitors of the growth of mammalian cancer cells. For example , erbstatin, a tyrosine kinase inhibi tor[,] selectively attenuates the in athymic nude mice of trans planted human mammary carcinoma which expresses epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase (EGFR) but is without effect on the growth of another carcinoma which does not express the EGF receptor. (Id., col. 1:49-57) The compounds of the invention are the result of the continued search for improved anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. ( Id., col. 2:1-4) 8. While more specific methods are also disclosed, the specification generally provides that the form ula I compounds and pharmaceutically accep table salts thereof can be prepared \"by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically-related compound s,\" and \"m ay be made from the appropriately substituted quinazol ine using the appropriately substituted amine.\" ( Id., col. 8:50-56) Similarly, while speci fic administrative methods are discussed, the \"[ a]dministration of the active compounds [generally] can be effected by any method which enables del ivery of the 6compounds to the site of action (e. g., cancer cells),\" which methods includ e \"oral and others. ( Id., col. 15:39-45) 9. It is disclosed that the active compounds of the invention are potent inhibitors of EGFR and may be used on a \"variety of human tumors (renal, liver, kidney, bladder, breast, gastric, ovarian, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, lung, vulval, thyroid, hepatic carcinomas, sarcomas, glioblastomas, various head and neck tumors),\" as well as for possible activi ty against \"a of col. 13:60-col.14:23) A procedure for determining the \"in vitro activity of the active compounds in inhibiting the receptor tyrosine kinase (and subsequent proliferative response, e.g., cancer)\" is provided. ( Id., col. 14:23-26 et seq.) The inventors state t hat, \"[a] lthough the inhibi tory properties of the compounds of [ f]ormula I vary with structural change as expected, the activity generally ex hibited by these agents, determined in the manner described above, 50 50is in the range of IC = 0.001-30 \u00ecM.\" (Id., col. 14:66-col. 15:2) This IC value is the6 only information that the inventors provide as to t he properties of the disclosed compounds; no in vivo , pharmacokinetic or at 286:19-287:2; D.I. 226, 546:8-14) 10. Claim 1 was consistent from t he '498 to the RE '065 patent, claiming a compound of formula I, further defining m, R , R and n. Claim 8 of t he '498 patent was1 2 originall y a Markush-style claim, listing specific permeations of the compound of claim 1. 50Generally, IC (or the half maximal inh ibitory concentration) is a measure of t he6 effectiveness of a compound in inhibiting a biochemical action. 7As reissued, claim 8 in the RE '065 patent now clai ms only erlotinib. The '498 patent contained clai ms specifically directed to the use of the compound of f ormula I in the treatment of cancer. As r eissued, the RE '065 patent contains clai ms directed to t he treatment of psoriasis. 11. In summ ary, plaintiffs have alleged, and Mylan has stipulated to, infringement of claims 1, 2, 4, 8, 34, and 35 of the RE '065 patent. Claims 1, 2, and 4 genericall y cover erlotinib, and claim 8 is specific for the compound erlotinib. Claims 34 and 35 further specify that erlotinib is in the form of, respectively, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a hydrochloride salt. 4. '221 patent 12. The '221 patent, entitled \"Stable Polymorph on N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7- bis(2methoxyethox y)-4-quinazolinamin e hydrochloride, Methods of Production, and Pharmaceutical Uses Thereof,\" was filed on November 9, 2000 and issued May 31, 2005. Priority is claimed to a provisional appli cation filed November 11, 1999. There are nine listed inventors: Timothy Norris; Jeffr ey W. Raggon; Richard D. D. Michael J. Morin; Barbara A. Foster; Karen J. Ferrante; and Sandra L. Silberman. The assignee is OSI. 13. The '221 patent relates to a st able form of erlotinib hydrochloride \"designated the B polymorph, its production in essentiall y pure form, and its use,\" as well as pharmaceutical compositions containing the stable polymorph B form, and to methods of tr eating hyperproliferative disorders (such as cancer) by administering the compound. ('221 patent, abstract) The specification of the '221 patent incorporates the '498 patent in its entirety for its disclosure of erlotinib hydrochl oride as an inhibi tor of 8EGFR. Also incorporated in its entirety is PCT International Publi cation No. WO 99/55683 for its disclosure of the mesylate for m of erlotinib hydrochloride. ( Id., col. 1:27-62) The novel polymorphs of the '221 patent are described as having X-ray power diffraction patterns having particular characteristic peaks. ( Id., col. 2:27-col.3:3; fig. 3) 14. Plaintiffs have asserted, and Mylan has stipulated to, infringement of claim 53 of the '221 patent. Claim 53 depends from claim 44, which clai ms as follows: 44. A method for the treatment of NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer), pediatric malignanci es, cervical and other tumors caused or promoted by human papill oma virus (HFV), Barrett's esophag us (pre-malignant syndrome), or neoplastic cutaneous diseases in a mammal comprising admin istering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of pharmaceutical composition comprised of at least one of N-(3- ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinamine, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in anhydrous or hydrate forms, and a carrier. Claim 53 depend s from claim 44 and requires that the method be for the treatm ent of NSCLC . The specification provides that, [i]n the method, the therapeutically effective amount may be from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg/day, or from about 25 to about 200 mg/day. In the method, the therapeutically effective amount may also be from about 1 to about 7000 mg/day; from about 5 to about 2500 mg/day; or from about 25 to about 200 mg/day. (Id., col. 4:31-37) B. The RE '065 Patent: O bviousness Insofar as the part ies did not present any claim construction disputes requiring resolution (D.I. 189), t he court proceeds to evaluate Mylan's first argument for invalidi ty: that claims 1, 2, 4, 8, 34, and 35 of the RE '065 patent are invalid as obvi ous in view of the prior art. 1. Obviousness standards 915. \"A patent m ay not be obtained . . . if the differences between the subject matter sought t o be patented and the prior art are such that the subj ect matter as a whole wou ld have been obvio us at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a). O bviousness is a question of law, which depends on underlyi ng factual inquiries. Under \u00a7 103, the scope and content of the pr ior art are t o be determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved. Against this background the obviousne ss or nonobviousness of the subject matt er is determined. Such secondary considerations as commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject m atter sought to be patented. KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , 550 U.S. 398, 406 (2007) ( quoting Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17-18 ( 1966)). 16. \"[A] patent composed of several elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was, independe ntly, known in the prior art.\" KSR, 550 U.S. at 418. Likewise, a defendant asserting obviou sness in view of a combination of references has the burden to show that a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field had a reason to combine the elements in the manner claimed. Id. at 418- 19. The Supreme Court has emphasized the need for courts to value \"common sense\" over \"rigid preventative rules\" in determining whether a motivation to combine existed. Id. at 419-20. \"[A]ny need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the t ime of invention and add ressed by the patent can provide a reason for combining the elements in the manner claimed.\" Id. at 420. In addition to showing that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had reason to attempt to make the composition or device, or carry 10out the claimed process, a defendant must also demonstrate that \"such a person would have had a reasonable ex pectation of success in doing so.\" Pharm aStem ViaCel l, Inc ., 491 F.3d 1342, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 17. A combination of prior art elements may have been \"obvious to try\" where there existed \"a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there [were] a finite number of identified, predictable solutions\" to it, and the pursuit of t he \"known options within [a person of ordinary skill in the art's] technical grasp\" leads to the anticipated success. Id. at 421. I n this circumstance, \"t he fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious under \u00a7 103.\" Id. Federal Circuit precedent has also establishe d that \"[ s]tructural r elationshi ps may provide the requisite motivation or suggestion to modify known compounds to obtain new compounds,\" and that particular types of structural similarity can give rise to a case of prima f acie obviousness. Genetics Institute, LLC v. Novartis Di agnostics, Inc. , 655 F.3d 1291, 1312 (Fed. Deuel , 51 F.3d 1552, 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1995)). 18. A court is r equired to consider secondary conside rations, or objective indicia of nonobviousness, before reaching an obvi ousness determination, as a \"check 2012 WL 1320225 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 16, 2012). \"Such secondary considerations as commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, etc., m ight be utilized to give lig ht to the circum stances surrounding the origin of the subject matt er sought to be patented.\" Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City , 383 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1966). 1119. \"Because patents are presumed t o be valid, see 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282, an alleged infringer seeking to invali date a patent on obviousness grounds must establish its obviousness by facts supported by clear and convincing evidence.\" Kao Corp. v. Unileve r U.S., I nc., 441 F.3d 963, 968 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). In conjunction with this burden, the Federal Circuit has expl ained that, [w]hen no prior art ot her than that which was considered by the PTO examiner is relied on by the attacker, he has t he added burden of overcoming the deference that is due to a qualified government agency presumed to have properly done its job, which includes one or more examiners who are assumed to have some expertise in in terpreting the refer ences and to be familiar from t heir work with the level of skill in the art and whose duty it is to issue only valid patents. PowerOasis, Inc. v. T- Mobile USA , Inc. , 522 F.3d 1299, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ( quoting Am. Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons , 725 F.2d 1350, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). 2. Mylan's evidence a. Overview 20. Mylan has identified a prior art compound differing fr om erlotinib only in that it contains an ethynyl group, rather than erlotinib's methyl group, at t he 3'-position. The disclosure of this compound is at example 51 of Zeneca' s European Patent Appli cation No. 0 566 226 A1, naming Andrew John Barker as inventor, filed January 15, 1993 (hereinafter, salts thereof, which possess anti-cancer activity,\" as well as their methods of manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions containi ng them, and the compounds' use in mammals. (Id. at p.2:1-5) The inventor stated that \"it has been indica ted [in the literature] that receptor t yrosine kinease inhi bitors will prove to be useful in the treatment of a variety of human cancers\" 12and, while \"[m]any quinazolin e detivatives are already known,\" it has now been discovered that certain quinazoli ne derivatives possess anti-cancer properties. ( Id. at p.2:32-49) The invention provides a quinazol ine derivative of the formula - providing speci fic alternatives for the values m, n, R and R . (Id. at p.1, 59 (claim 1)) 1 2 21. Among the invention's non-limiting examples, the followi ng disclosure was provided for example 51. (DTX-286 at 46) There is only one difference between this compound (6,7-di-(2- methoxyethox y)-4-(3'-m ethylanili at the 3' position of the m olecule, whi le the compound of example 51 3has a methyl group (H C-) at the 3' position, as highlighted belo w. 13 (D.I. 232 at 12) 22. Mylan argues that, \"given a medicinal chemist's know ledge of the chemical similarities between methyl and ethynyl, and the specific suggestion in the [prior art] to use a 'small, non-polar group' at that position, clear and convincing evidence establishes that it would have been obvious for a medicinal chemist, working on new EGFR inhibi tors, t o start with t he Barker] '226 appli cation and make erlotinib.\" (D.I. 232 at 30) Mor e specifically, it is Mylan's contention that the ordinary medicinal chemist woul d have: (1) started with the Barker '226 application; (2) identified the gap in the claim coverage as not covering alkynyl (such as ethynyl) and alkenyl; (3) recognized a suggestion in the prior art to use a small, non-polar group, such as ethynyl, at the 3'-position; and (4) f illed the gap by putting an ethynyl group at the 3'- position of the best compounds of the Barker '226 application. \"This approach would have satisfied the medicinal chemist's motivation to make EGFR inhib itors other '226 appli cation.\" ( Id. at 32) b. Selection of example 51 as a starting compound 23. As noted above, the earliest priority date f or the RE '065 patent is June 6, 1995. Mylan argues that, at the time of the invention, the 4-anilinoq uinazoli nes (or \"4- 14AQs\") of the Barker '226 application were the best star ting point for making an EGFR inhibi tor. (D.I. 232 at 32) Mylan's expert, Dr. Clayton Heathcock (\"Heathcock\"), Emeritus Professor of Chemistry from t he University of California at Berkeley, testified regarding several review articles follo wing the publi cation of the Barker '226 application (in 1993) indicating that quinazo lines were idea l in this regard. (D.I . 225 at 298:16- 300:19) A March/April 1993 publication in \"The Current Opinion in Therapeutic Patents,\" for example , discussed the benefits as methoxyanil ino)quinazo line. (DTX-428) Another example is a June 1994 article by David Fry (\"Fry\"), a Parke-Davis scientist, entitled \"Expert Opinion on Investigation (hereinafter, he \"Fry review article\"). (DTX-354; D.I. 303:7-304:1) The Fry review article discussed epide rmal growth factor receptor kinase as a target f or cancer chemotherapy. (DTX-354) According to Heathcock, a person of ordinary skill in the art would have noticed the statements in the Fr y review article that certain 4-AQs were the most potent inhibi tors of t he tyrosine kinase thus far to be r evealed, and that Parke-Davis was currently working in this area. (D.I. 225 at 304:5-21) 24. Fry subsequently published an article entitle d \"A Specific Inhibitor of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase\" in the high-profile journal S cience the \"Fry Science article\"). (PTX-43; D.I. 225 at 301:10-15) The Fry Science article disclosed a molecule called \"PD 153035 ,\" as labeled by Parke- Davis Pharmaceutical Research, having the followin g structure. 15(PTX-43 at fig. 1) Heathcock testified that this compound is the same as t hat in example 2 of the Barker '226 appli cation, and that the Fry Science article indicated that it is both a very potent compound and is highl y selective for EGFR. ( D.I. 225 at 301:2- 303:6) Mylan argues that \" [i]n view of the Fry Science article, [ ] Fry's review article, and other valuable information, there was little, if any, doubt that the 4-AQs were the best place for a medicinal chemist to start making potent, selective EGFR inhibitors.\" (D.I. 232 at 11) 25. To this end, Mylan also argues that t he Barker '226 applica tion suggests compounds that were better EGFR inhibitors than others. Only thirteen specific compounds were claimed in the Barker '226 appl ication; these thirteen compounds were disclosed in the specification among a list of 32 \"specific preferred\" compounds. 7 (D.I. 232 at 11; DTX-286 58-62 (claims 7, 9); D.I. 225 at 311:21-312:5) The compound of example 51 wa s one of three compounds claimed in claim 9. (D.I . 225 at 311:10-14) The Barker '226 application did not disclose biol ogical data for the compound of example 51. ( Id. at 313:1-3) Biolog ical data was only discl osed for five 4- Still addi tional compounds were li sted as \"preferr ed\" rather t han \"specific7 preferred\" compounds according to specification. 16AQ compounds. (DTX-286 at 21) Heathcock exp lained that this disclosure is 8 sufficient to show the reader that this whole class of compounds is good . . . [T]hey've selected exa mples [for which biological data was provided] with a variety of different substituents, and so that [ ] is the import ant message a medicinal chemist woul d take from this set of data. It would not at all be presumed to be all the biological data they had. You would naturally assume that they had tested a lot mor e than just f ive[] compounds. And there was no reason9 to think that t hey had picked out their best five compounds to illustrate with biologi cal data. For one thing, I think none of these five compounds were listed in the claims, and at least three of them were not even called specific preferred compounds of the invention. I would take this, and I think a person of ordinary skill in the art would take this data to be representative of t he family. (D.I. 225 at 409:9-410:5) 26. Heathcock also testified that, of the 105 compounds actually made, between 75 and 80 exampl es had a methyl (alkyl) group at t he 3' position of the molecule, \"and a fairly large number, 15 or so, had a halogen or some other substituent at the 3' position.\" ( Id. at 310:7-18) It is his opinion, therefore, t hat \"medicinal chemists would notice that alkenes and alkynes were omitted after he specification' s] definitions,\" other from the [Barker] '226 [application] to decide, well , if I'm put . . and alkyne in this. . aniline position, what should I use for the quinazoline? \" (Id. at 310:23-311:4) Looking at the Barker '226 applica tion to determine what the inventors regarded as t he best, a medicinal chemist woul d \"swap out whatever [he] had in the aniline ring and put in an \"[B]y way of example,\" IC50 data was 21:23-30) It is unclear why Heathcock refers t o five compounds. As noted previously,9 Mylan asserts in its post-t rial papers that there were only four exemplified; the court has also identified four compounds on the cited page of t he Barker '226 applica tion. 17anilin e that had or the alkenyl.\" ( Id. at 31144-9) 2 27. The debated substituent (on the aniline ring) is the R position. The Barker '226 appli cation provides that the R 4: 46-51) Claim 1 also requires that each R is one of these2 groups. ( Id. at 59:49-51) The specification provid es suitable values for R in various2 combinations, for example, \"[a] suitable value for R or R when it is (1-4C)alkyl is, for1 2 example , the Barker '226 application names alkyl groups for R - the relevant2 radical of an alkane, or a hydrocarbon substituent having only singl e bonds.

Ethynyl (HC /C-), the substituent in , is an alkynyl group. 226 at 405:20-21) 28. Mylan refers to the foregoing as a \"gap\" in t he coverage of the Barker '226 applicatio n. According to Heathcock, \"if you ar e trained as an organic chemist, which a medicinal chemist woul d be, in many cases . . . you're going to do a double-take, because right after alkyl, something could be there that isn't[:] alkenyl and alkynyl [,]\" despite the inclusio n of other m ore complicated substituents. \"[T] hat would be (1-4C) means that you can have one, two, three or four carbon atoms in t he10 functional group.

(Id. at 305:22-306:4) Heathcock explained that, because there are 32 lines of text detailing the possibi lities for the R1 position, but only two lines of definition for R (\"a m uch more manageable group to get2 your arms around\"), \"a medicinal chemist is going to look there [at R ] first to see . . .2 what works there.\" (Id. at 306:12-22) I t is at t his point that a person of ordinary skill in the art ( a medicinal chemist) would notice the absence of alkenyl and alkynyl groups as R examples. ( Id. at 306:23-307:15) 2 29. Mylan also argues that the similarity of the alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups supports an obviousness determination. As noted above, all three are hydrocarbons and have single -bonded, double-bond ed, and triple-bonded carbons, respectively. Heathcock referred to t he these hydrocarbons as the \"three siblings\" of the hydrocarbon family. ( Id. at 308:4-19) Mylan points to two prior art articles classifying \"methyl, ethyl or ethynyl\" and \"hydrogen, as \"sm all,\" and OSI's expert did not this characterization. 6131; DTX-589 at 117; D.I. 227 at 722:4-14, 771:18-772:6) 30. Another similarity is that both et hynyl groups (erlotinib) and methyl groups (a common 3' substituent in 4-AQs modify example 51: the Barker Abstracts 31. As discussed previously, it is Mylan's position that, after star ting with the Barker '226 applica tion and identifying the gap in its clai m coverage at the 3'-position, a 19person of ordinary skill in the art would have been further motivated to fill the gap (with an ethynyl group) in view of: an abstract by A. J. Barker at al. entitled \"Structure Activity Relationsh ips of nes Activity\" (hereinafter, the \" ESMO abstract\") ; and an abstract by t he same authors entitled11 \"Inhibition of 32. The ESMO abstract disclosed a series of quinazo lines havin g a variety of substituted aniline s at the 4-position, and stated t hat \"[t] he most potent inhibitors possess small, relatively non-pola r substituents in the met a-position of small, non-polar group ESMO abstract was a \" chloro group\" (chlorine) at the 3'-position.

(D.I. Heathcock explaine d, the Barker abstr acts provided \"information not confined to necessarily what was presented in the [Barker '226 applicatio n].\" (D.I. 225 at 385:1- 4) 33. With respect to selection of an ethynyl group at the 3'-position, Heathcock states that an et hynyl group is small and non-polar, and \"is certainly not contradicted by [the BJC] abstract. \" (Id. at 328:3-6) Heathcock testified that \"small\" is \"kind of a relative term,\" however, \"[i]n t he context of this matter, small definitely means no more than a few carbons, two or t hree at most, and really there are a very sm all number of lipophil ic substituents that are larger t han that.\" (D.I. 225 at 402:3-9) Mylan also points to testimony by OSI's expert, William L. Jorgensen (\"Jorgensen\") (a professor at Yale University), that ethynyl is \"sm all.\" (D.I. 232 at 26 (citing D.I. 227 at Mylan argues that t edicinal chemist] noticed that t here is this omission in the definitions for the anilin o ring, [he] would then fill that missing definition with the things that were missing, the ethynyl and the vinyl being the two smallest representatives of the multiple-bonded hydrocarbon type groups.\" ( D.I. highli ghts Jorgensen's testimony that a person of ordinary skill in the art would \"use[ ] substituents that one feels are suitable for medicinal chemistry,\" and \" could probe larger substituents\" as \"a norm al medicinal chemistry activity.\" (D.I. 227 at 7801:17-781:6) When asked about probing smaller substituents, Jorgensen stated that \"changing the 21size of the halogen ,\" for example, trying fluorine, chlorine, and bromine, is a \"normal exercise.\" ( Id.) (emphasis ize Mylan's recognizi ng an ethynyl group as a small, non-polar group similar to the methyl group used at R in2 example 51 of the Barker '226 appli cation, and having observed the \"gap\" in coverage at R in contrasting the broader protection for the 6- and 7-positions of the quinazoline2 ring (R ), a m edicinal chemist would have found it easy to modify example 51 in this1 manner in order to avoid the claim coverage of t he Barker '226 applica tion. (D.I. 232 305:22-306:22) 35. According to Mylan, Pfizer followed this exact path to arrive at erlotinib. Pfizer made its first 4-AQ with a 3'ethynyl group on April 12, 1994, \"around the time that [the] Barker Abstr acts suggested that small, non-polar groups are best f or 4-AQs.\" (D.I. 232 at 21; D.I. 226 at 505:14-25) According to Dr. Lee Daniel Arnold (\"Arnold\"), the lead medicina l chemist on Pfizer's EGFR Project Team and co-inventor of the RE '065 patent, Pfizer and Zeneca were in a \"competitive race to identify t he best EGFR inhibi tor\" and had, on several occasions, identified the same lead molecules in their pursuits. (D.I . 226 at 490:11-21, 581:16-20) On June 28, 1994, Arnold relayed an abstract fr om a scientific conference held in Salt Lake City, Utah between June 21-25, 1994 to members of his team at Pfizer. (DTX-93) The abstract discussed the high potency of PD 153035, disclosed in the Fry Science article and as example 2 of the Barker '226 applica tion, which was also know n to Pfizer as \"CP-288865.\" ( Id.) Arnold's handwritten notes state, with r the 3' bromine, t hat \"lipophili c\" substitutions14 The notes were based on information relayed to Arnold by Dr. John Lowe, a14 Pfizer chemist, at t he conference. later,\" in November 1994, Pfizer scientists used an ethynyl group at the 3'-position to make erlotinib. 226 at 464:12-15) 3. Analys is a. Selection of the lead compound 36. It was not genuinel y disputed that the Barker '226 application was \"one of the best pieces of prior art .\" (D.I. 226 at 674:12-14) The parties agree that the compound of example 51 wa s one of thirteen prefer red EGFR inhibitors disclo sed in claims 7 and 9 therein. The fact t hat thirteen 4-AQ compounds were specifically claimed is not dispositive , however, of t he lead compound issue . See Daii chi Sankyo Co., Ltd. v. Matrix Labs., Ltd., 619 F.3d 1346, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Rather, it is the possession of promising useful properties in a lead compound that motivates a chemist to make structurally similar compounds. Yet the attribution of a compound as a lead compound after the fact must avoid hindsigh t bias; [the court] must look at the state of the art at the time the invention was made to find a motivation to select and then modify a lead compound to arrive at the claimed invention. . . Potent and promising activity in the prior art t rumps mere st ructural relationships. Id. (citations omitted) ( emphasis in origina l); see also Eisai Co. Reddy' s f acie case of obviousness for a chemical compound still , in general, begins with the reasoned 23identification of a lead compound .\"). 37. Mylan's proffered explanation for why exampl e 51 would have been selected from t he thirteen compounds identified in cla ims 7 and 9 is that t he Barker '226 applicatio n provides a specific method for preparing the hydrochloride salt of the compound of example 51. (D.I. 232 at 12) Heathcock testified that certain publications, for example, the Fry review article, talked about the benefits of 4-AQs. ( Id. at 32 (citing D.I. 225 at 298:16-300:19)) Similarly, Heathcock testified that a to Zeneca (hereinafter, the Zeneca \"'772 patent\") \"made an impact because it reported about t hree dozen [ ] compounds [ ] with enough in vitro biolog ical data to show that there was very good potency across the board in this family of [4- AQ] compounds.\" ( Id. 294:6-295:6); DTX-772) Mylan appli cation were \"attractive points\" for making novel EGFR inhibitors because 4-AQs can be made by high-speed synthesis. (D.I. 232 at 33) Pfizer was researching 4-AQs and was aware of the Barker '226 application coverage . (Id. at 34; PTX-310; DTX-98) 38. Absent from the foregoing, however, is any indication in the prior art regarding \"useful properties\" or \"[ p]otent and pr omising activity\" for the t hirteen compounds of claims 7 and 9 of the Barker '226 application, let alone ex ample 51 specificall y. See Daii chi, 619 F.3d at 1354. Mylan admits that the '226 applicatio n does not disclose any biol ogical activity for these thirteen compounds. (D.I . 232 at 11; D.I. 225 at 350:13-351:8) Mylan does not point to \" knowledg e in the art of the functional activities and limitation s\" of t he focused-on compounds. See Daii chi, 619 F.3d at 1354. Heathcock admitted that biologi cal data is very important t o medicinal 24chemists. (D.I . 225 at 352:14-16) Mylan's theory boils down to a general assertion that a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that \"there is somet hing really that Zeneca likes abo ut these 13 compounds or [it] wouldn't have taken the time to claim them individual ly by name [in the Barker '226 application].\" ( Id. at 335:19-22) 39. OSI pr esented the testimony of Dr. Alexa nder Bridges (\"Bridges\"), a Parke- Davis scientist who worked on findi ng new EGFR inhi bitors and has a dozen patents in that area. Bridges testified that example 51 of the Barker '226 applica tion would be less of a candidate as a lead compound due to the fact t hat \"you don't know anything about it.\" ( D.I. 226 at 622:13-23) OSI's other expert, Jorgensen, explained that there 50are ten compounds for which IC and phosphorylation data is the Zeneca '772 patent and the Fry Science article. A person of ordinary skill in the art would look at these ten compounds because of the \"well- 50defined IC \" and, particularly, an \"extremely potent\" molecule in the Fry Science article, based on the biologi cal data disclosed. (D.I. 227 at 745:19-747:21) Bridges agreed that the Fry Science article compound disclosed a (3' bromo-anilin oquinazol ine) compound with \"quite d that the '226 50applicatio n itself disclosed a very potent quinazoli ne (IC of 5 nm) having a methyl 3group agreed that \"in vitro potency is what drives medicinal chemistry discovery at the first stage.\" (D.I. 225 at 386:20-387:1) Heathcock \"focus[ed] on the data when [he] talked about the '772 patent\" but, in the absence of data for the t hirteen compounds in the Barker '226 applica tion, asks the court to focus only on the patent claims. (Id. at 351:9- 352:13) 2540. Finally, as OSI points out, t he prior art disclosed other compounds with favorable characteristics that were not 4-AQs. (D.I. 225 at 387:2-396:7) O ne such compound, an indolyl amino quinazoli ne compound, was not considered by Heathcock15 despite having a 1 nm potency. ( Id.; PTX-11 at 15:40-45) I n perspective, this is a higher potency than any of the compounds listed in the Barker '226 applicatio n or Zeneca's '77 2 225 at 390:18-24) 41. In short , a person of or dinary skill in the art had several alternatives to consider and, since potency drives the research, the court is not persuaded by Mylan's argument that t he ease of synthesis (rather t han promising activity) would have le d an ordinary artisian to pursue the 4-AQs of the Barker '226 application or example 51 as16 a lead compound. See Daii chi, 619 F.3d at 1354 (collecting cases). The court found Bridges' testimony more persuasive than Heathcock's in this regard. b. Moti vation to modify 42. Even if the court were to credit the m otivation to select example 51 as the lead compound, \"it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have le d a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner to est ablish prima facie obviousness 225 at embraces all thirteen compounds. ( D.I. 232 at16 32) However, it is the court 's understanding that only the compound of example 51 can be modified at the 3'-position with an ethynyl group to provide erlotinib. ( Id. at 12) Mylan has not specified how the other twelve compounds relate to erlotinib. When addressing the motivation to modify, the court will hereina fter refer only to the compound of example 51. 26Pty., Ltd. , 492 F.3d 1350, , 619 F.3d at 1352. In this regard, Mylan's proffered m otivation to modify the compound of example 51 of the Barker '226 appli cation is twofold: (1) an ordinary art isan would have looked for holes in patent coverage, identifying an alkyn yl \"gap\" in coverage; and (2) filled the gap with ethynyl based on the Barker Abstracts' suggestions to use sm all or non-polar groups at the 3'-position. (D.I. 232 at 32) 43. The Federal Circuit has stated that \"t he requisite motivation [to modify] can come from any number of sources and need not necessarily be expli cit in the prior art. \" Eisai 1293, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2007)). While the obviousne ss inquiry is a flexib le one, Mylan does not provide any caselaw in dicating that the motivation to modify m ay be derived specifical ly from t he desire to avoid the prior art. KSR does not appear to specificall y preclude this scenario so long as it is proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that \"design need or market pressure t o solve a problem\" and \"a finite number of identified, predictable solutio ns\" existed such that species within a gap in patent coverage provided \"known option s\" within the technical grasp of the ordinary artisan. KSR, 550 U.S. at 421. 44. This is not that case, however. In support f or its argument, Mylan emphasizes that Arnold (at Pfizer) comm ented upon and circulated a patent abstract to his colleag ues. (D.I. 232 at 35 (citing D.I. 226 at 578:10-582:19, DTX-93)) But what Arnold did wi th respect to one abstract is not informat ive with respect to motivation of the hypothetical person of ordinary skill in the art. M oreover, the Barker '226 application omits not only alkynes as possible groups for R , but alkenes as well. Halogens are2 27also not mentioned, such as the chloro- group disclosed at the 3'-position in the Barker Abstracts. W hile the precise number of alternatives is not clear, on this record, the court does not find persuasive Mylan's argument that t he absence of teaching the ethynyl substituent in the Barker '226 applicatio n would have sugge sted to an ordinary artisan to select it. 45. The court next evaluates whether a motivation to modify t he compound of example 51 of the Barker '226 appli cation is provided by the Barker Abstracts. As discussed previousl y, the only compound disclosed in either abstract was a compound substituted at the 3'-position with a chlorine - a halogen. As Bridges ex plained , chlorine is a polar substituent; the dipole moments of a halogen-substituted benzene ring is17 approxi mately four times that of a m ring. (D.I. 226 at 631:11- 633:13; PTX-232) Heathcock's description of the bonds between chl orine and bromine (another halogen) with carbon as \"polar bonds\" is consistent with this evidence. (D.I. 225 at 325:16-25, 383:19-384:13) 46. The court also notes that the ESMO abstract is internally incon sistent: it states a preference f or \"small, relatively non-polar substituents\" at the 3'-position, but exempli fies a compound having a chlorine (a polar) substituent. Thus, the motivation to use a \"non-polar\" substituent is diminished, in some capacity, by its concurrent t eaching to use a chloro group. The court does not attempt t o quantify this effect, except to18 A measure of the separation of t he negative and positive charges (polarity). 17 (D.I. 226 at 631:7-8) Jorgensen testified that a person of ordinary skill in the art reading the ESMO18 abstract would have been \"slightly confused\" by the chloro group because the abstract says \"nonpolar;\" it is \"sloppy\" wording. (D.I . 227 at 713:2-14) that it not f ind convinci ng Heathcock's testimony that \"the chlorine itself as it affects the properties of the molecule is a non-polar substituent because addin g the chlorine makes the molecule more lipophilic\" and, thus, chlorine is akin to other lipophi lic groups such as ethynyl. (D.I. 232 at 17; D.I. 225 at 324:6-325:15, 326:1-3) (emphasis added) First, both abstr acts specifically stated that the 3' \"substituent\" must be non-polar. Secondly, neither Barker Abstract discussed lipophil icity. The court19 found persuasive Bridges and Jorgensen's testimony that polarity and lipophil icity are different concepts different measures. 629:13-635:7; D.I . 227 at PTX-232) 47. The agreed that an ethynyl group is a \"small\" substituent, as it has two carbon atoms. Mylan argues that, in view of the Barker Abstracts, \"t he most logical starting point for r eplacing the group at t he 3' position of Barker's 4-AQs with an alkenyl group would have bee n to use the smallest such groups, namely, the ethenyl and ethynyl groups.\" 225 334:6-18) There are two flaws in this logic. Mylan concurrently asserts that the ESMO abstract's use of chlorine should be informative with respect to t he size of the molecule, not with respect to the type of substituent (a halogen). Notwithstanding, Mylan's position presupposes that a skilled artisan would be seekin g to replace the 3' substituent with an alkenyl group. As Jorgensen testified, 80 (lipophilic and non-li pophili c) alkyl substituents having As Jorgensen testified, a is something that is at tached to another19 entity;\" it is not the entire molecule. (D.I. 227 at 712:14-15) 29one to four carbon atoms and that fit t he general description for a \"small\" substituent. 20 (D.I. 227 at 720:15-723:11) Mylan's did not offer any credible evidence regarding why a skilled artisan wou ld hone in on an alken yl group. c. Expectation of success 48. The court notes at this juncture t hat, even had Mylan proven that the et hynyl substituent was one of a \"finite number of identified, predictable solutions,\" its evidence of its \"anticipated success\" is not clear and convincing. KSR, 550 U.S. at 421. Mylan concentrates on two documents in this regard. The first is an internal Pfizer memo ( to the \"EGFR Project Team\" dated October 6, 1995), stating that \" two newer acetylenic anilin o inhibitors were highl y selective as expected .\" (DTX-18) (emphasis added) Similarly, another Pfizer memo regarding \"selectivity studies on CP-358774\" (dated January 5, 1995) stated that the CP-358774 compound is \"a potent and highl y selective EGFR inhibi tor, as expected .\" (DTX-19) (emphasis added) According to Mylan, [t]hese statem ents are not, of course, comparisons of erlotinib with the closest prior art. But the statem ents suggest that even Pfizer's own scientists expected erlotibin a selective bitor. sures in Zeneca's Barker Abstracts, which taught that the most potent 4-AQ inhibitors had small non-polar groups (such as the ethynyl group) at the 3'-position. (D.I. 232 at 40) The court makes no express finding regarding the conflicting testimony on the20 meaning of \"small\" as used in the Barker Abstracts in view of Mylan's lack of evidence indicating a finite universe of alternatives. See In re Cyclobenzaprine , of obviousness, especial ly when that evidence is proffered in support of an 'obvious to try' theory, is insufficient unless it indicates that the possible optio ns skilled artisans woul d have encountered were 'finite,' 'small ,' or 'easily traversed' and that skilled artisans would have had a reason to select the r oute that precluded the claimed inve ntion\") (citation omitted). 3049. As an initial matter, t he views of particular Pfizer researchers may not be indicative of those of the hypothetical person of ordinary skill in the art; Mylan off ers no expert testimony in this regard. ( Id.) Additionally, OSI presented credible eviden ce indicating that the pr ior art taught away fr om using ethynyl compounds because they \"tended to be toxic\" and \"led to inactivation of critical [cytochrome P450] liver enzymes,\" except when used in very low dosages in birth control medications. (D.I. 226 at 506:19- 507:12 (\"at many ot her companies within the pharmaceutical in dustry, this t ype of substituent was forbidden\"), 661:12-662:9; substituent is called at 484) d. Secondary considerations 50. Finally, in formulating its decision, the court considered OSI's proffered evidence of nonobvi ousness. OSI's first that erlotinib has unexpectedl y21 superior potency compared to the closest prior ar t, which is not example 51 of the Barker '226 applica tion, but a 3'-ethyl compound disclosed in 2008 (whi ch, it argues, falls within the claims of requirement that an invention's properties and advantages were fully known The court reads In re Cyclobenzaprine , supra , as requiring a review of such21 evidence even wh ere it is clear that defendants can not meet their burden to pr ove obviousness by clea r and convincing evide nce. Defendants objected to the admission of PTX-230, a document depicting the22 3'ethyl analog as well as its potency, on the basis that it was not prior art t o the RE '065 patent. 31before the patent application was filed.\" Knoll Pharm a. Co., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 367 1381, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2004). However, the court must assess secondary considerations agai nst the background of the differ ences between the prior art and the claims at issue. See Graham , 383 U.S. at 17. OSI does not argue t hat the 3'-ethyl compound was actually di sclosed in the prior art, and its synt hesis and assessment 13 years after t he priority date is not persuasive on this factor. 51. OSI also presented test imony by Dr. Malcom M oore (\"Moore\") , the head of the Division of Medical Onclog y at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto and the University Director of Medical Oncology at the University of Toronto. Moore testified that erlotinib is one of only two FDA-approved drugs to treat pancreatic cancer, which has the poorest 5-year survival rate for all cancers. ( D.I. 227 at 902:22-904:12) Erlotinib is approved to be used in connection with the first drug, gemcitabine, a traditional chemotherapy drug. ( Id.) Moore was the principal inve stigator of the Phase III trials for erlotinib with gemcitabine, which revealed a \"stastically significant ( Id. at 907:3-12, results pected\" because treating pancreatic cancer has been \"littered with failure in Phase III\" and, t hus, \"any positive result in this disease is unex pected.\" (Id. at 909:19-910:5) 23 52. As Mylan points out, M oore is not a medicinal chemist. \"[A] witness not qualified in the pertinent art may not testify as an expert on obviousne ss or any of t he While Mylan emphasizes that the median survival benefit for the study was23 shown to be about 11 to 12 days, Moore em phasized that picking a sing le point on a survival curve was not the proper measure f or evaluating the curve as a whole. (D.I. 227 at 915:24-916:11) 32underlying techni cal questions, such as the nature of the claimed invention, nature and scope of the prior art , the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art, or the motivation of one of ordinary skill in the art to combine [them]. \" Sundance, Inc. v. DeMonte Fabricating Ltd. , 550 F.3d 1356, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Moore's testimony, therefore, m ay not be relied upon for obviousness purposes. 53. OSI also adduced evidence that erlotinib has achieve d commercial success. According to OSI's expert on economics invol ving the pharmaceutical industry, Dr. Robert Maness (\"Maness\") , Tarceva\u00ae has worldwide sal es of about a billion doll ars since its launch and its United States sales have continued to grow. It was the most successful American oncolog y drug launch with respect to the number of new patients and the fourth largest in ter ms of r evenues. (D.I. 228 at 956:13-958:2, 962:8-964:5) Maness Tarceva\u00ae to erlotinib, which gen erates the properties that are in demand. ( Id. at 950:17-23, 951:21-952:5, 978:2-16) While the parties generally agree that Tarceva\u00ae is profitable, as Mylan points out, OSI does not point to24 testimony providing context for these numbers. ( D.I. 233 at 45) See, e.g., m ust exercise care in assessing proffered evidence of objective considerations, givin g such evidence wei ght only where the objective indicia are attr ibutable to the inventive characteristics of the discovery as claimed in the patent.\") (internal quotations and citation omitted) Subject to a disagreement of how the r elevant market is defined. OSI asserted24 that Tarceva\u00ae has a near 100% market share when the relevant market is defined as Tarceva\u00ae and Iressa\u00ae - an EGFR antibody drug with limited FD A approval in the United States. Mylan emphasizes that the mar ket should not be so narrowed, due to the fact t hat OSI listed other \" competitors\" to Tarceva\u00ae on internal documents. The court need not define the relevant market as its opinion does not rest on this fact. 33(emphasis added). 4. Conclusion 54. In view of t he foregoing, the court finds that the RE '065 patent is valid. While the \"motivation to select and modify a lead compound need not be expli cit in the art\" under t he flexib le rubric of KSR, Mylan has not met its burden to demonstrat e that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to select example 51 of the Barker '226 applica tion as a lead compound and modify the 3'-position with an ethynyl group to arrive at er 1356-57). In reaching its conclusion, the court is in agreement with the PTO, which issued the RE '065 patent over the Barker '226 applicatio n on (PTX-15; D.I. 227 at 708:5-13) C. The '221 Patent 55. The court t urns next to Mylan's arguments that t he '221 patent is invali d as anticipated or as obvious in view of the prior art. As noted above, claim 53 of the '221 patent is directed to the t reatment of NSCLC with \"a therapeutically effective amount of pharmaceutical composition comprised of at least one of N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2- methoxyethox y)-4-quinazolinamin e, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrate forms, and a carrier.\" Mylan argues that every element of claim 53 of the '221 patent is disclosed in both the '498 patent and an abstract entitled \"Development of a Potent, Specific Inhibitor of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (CP-358,774) as an Anti-Cancer Therapeutic Agent\" by Kenneth K. Iwata et. al. ( Cold 232 at 48) 341. Anticipati on a. Standards 56. An anticipation inqui ry involves two steps. First, the court m ust construe the claims of the patent in suit as a m atter of law. See Key Phar. v. Hercon Labs. Corp. , 161 F.3d 709, 714 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Second, the finder of fact must compare t he construed claims against the prior art. See id. Proving a patent invalid by anticip ation \"requires that the f our corners of a single, prior art document describe every element of the claimed invention, either ex pressly or inherently, such that a person of ordinary skill in the art could practice the invention without undue ex perimentation.\" Advanced Display Sys. Inc. v. Kent State Univ ., 212 F.3d 1272, 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). The Federal Circui t has stated t hat \"[t] here must be no difference between the claimed inventio n and the referenced disclosure, as viewed by a person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention.\" Scripps Clin ic & Research Found. v. Genentech, Inc ., 927 F.2d 1565, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The elements of the prior art must be arranged or combined in the same manner as in the claim at issue, but t he reference need not satisfy an ipsissim is verbis test. In re Gleave , 560 F.3d 1331, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citations omitted). \"In determining whether a patented invention is [expli citly] anticipated, the claims are read in the context of the patent specification in which they arise and in which the inven tion is described.\" Glaverbel Societe Anonym Supply, Inc ., 45 F.3d 1550, 1554 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The prosecution history and the prior art may be consulted \"[i]f needed to impart clarity or avoid ambiguity\" in ascertaining whether the invention is novel or was previously known in the art. Id. (internal citations omitted). 3557. A prior art reference may anticipate without explici tly disclosing a feature of the claimed invention if that missing characteristic is inherently present in the single anticipating reference. See Continen tal Can Co. USA v. Monsanto Co. , 948 F.2d 1264, 1268 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The Federal Circuit has explai ned that an inherent limitation is one that is \"necessarily present\" and not one that may be established by \"probabili ties or possibilitie s.\" See id. at 1268-69. That is, \" [t]he mer e fact that a certain thing may result from a given set of circumstances is not suf ficient.\" Id. at 1269 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). b. The '498 patent does not anticipate 58. As discussed above, the '498 patent was reissued as the RE '065 patent. The '498 patent described and cla imed erlotinib, and ex plained that erlotinib is an EGFR inhibi tor. The '498 patent provided that, while the \"inhibi tory properties of the compounds of [f]orm ula I vary with struct ural change as exp ected, the activity generally 50exhibited by these agents is in the range of IC = 0.0001-30 \u00ecm.\" (JTX-3, col. 15:6-11) Claim 14 of the '498 patent was directed to the use of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one of the compounds of claim 1 f or treating \"brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder, gastric, pancreatic, breast, head, neck oesphageal , gynecological or thyroid cancer.\" (Id. at col. 41, ll. 61-63; see also id. at col. 44, ll. 3-8 (claim 23), col. 44, ll. 23-27 (claim 29)) 59. Contrary t o Mylan's contention, however, claims 14, 23 and 29 of the '498 patent do not disclose using erlotini b for the t reatment of \"lung cancer,\" rather, they refer to the thousands of compounds encompassed by formula I in the treatment of various cancers. Even if one were to limit t he universe to the 12 broad categories of cancers 36recited in claim 14, with 105 exempl ified compounds, there would still be at least 1,260 combinations of possible treatments. There is no disclosure or direction in the '49825 patent that one should select erlotinib and NSC LC out of all of the possible combinations. As OSI's expert Dr. Alan Sandler (\"Sandler\") testified, an oncologist26 would not read the '498 patent to teach that every compound disclose d would be a treatment f or every disease disclosed. (D.I 227 at 845:11-847:19) The court found27 Sandler's testimony convinci ng, and concludes that the '498 patent does not disclose all of the elements of claim 53 as ar ranged or combined in the same manner as in the claim - i.e., erlotinib for the t reatment of NSCLC . In re Gleave , 560 F.3d at 1334. c. The 1998 Cold Spring Harbor Abstract 60. The 1998 Cold Spring Ha rbor Abstract is part of a collection of abstracts \"presented at the Special Anniversary Cold Sp ring Harbor Winter Conference on Pathways to Cancer\" between March 11-14, 1998. (DTX-79) It is Mylan's position that, after their er lotinib patent appli cation was filed, the Pfizer and OSI scientists publicly described the use of erlotinib for treating NSCLC in the 1998 Cold Spring Harbor Abstract. M ylan's ex pert, Dr. Mark Ratain ( \"Ratain\"), a renowned oncologist from the University of Chicago Medical Center, testified that the 1998 Cold Spring Harbor Abstract expressly disclose s every element of claim 53 of the '221 patent except for the Mylan points out that OSI advances no eviden ce in support of its calculations,25 however, it does not argue that O SI's calculation s are incorrect. (D.I. 234 at 21, n.17) Professor of Medicine and the Chief of the Division of Hematology Oncology at26 The Oregon Health and Scien ce University. The parties agree that a person of or dinary skill in the art for the '221 patent is a27 medical oncolo gist, unlike the '498 patent, which was directed to a medicinal chemist. 37carrier. ( D.I. 224 at 63:18-24) The abstract discloses the erlotinib compound when referring to \" CP-358774.\" ( Id. at 87:19-88:2) Ratain testified that erlotinib's NSCLC is osed in the followin g statement: The elevated expressio n of EGFR has frequently been associated with breast cancer, gliomas, pancreatic cancers, non-small cell lung cancers and squamous cell tumors of the head and neck. CP-358,774 is a selective and 50potent inhibitor of isolated human EGFR with an IC of 2 nM[ .] (DTX-79 at OSI00941044) Further, t he abstract reaff irms using erlotinib: \"CP-358,774, as a potent, specific the tyr osine kinase activi ty of EGFR has the potential of providing a high ly targeted cancer therapeutic for a wide range of cancers which woul d be well tolerated.\" ( Id.; D.I. 224 at126:19-23) 100:6-17) While the abstract does not expressly disclose a carrier, it is Mylan's position that the use of a carrier is inherent in orally administered drugs. (D.I. 224 at 128:11-18; see also id. at 63:25-64:3 (Ratain has never prescribed a drug not including a carrier), 100:15-17 (\"oral administration of a drug implies a carrier\"), 127:2-4 (Ratain testifying that a carr ier is \"inherent\")) Absent factual foundation, however, the court f inds this generalize d28 testimony falls short of clear and convincin g proof that a carrier is \"necessarily present.\" See Continen tal Can , 948 F.2d at 1268-69. 61. Sandler testified for OSI that the 1998 Cold Spring Harbor Abstract describes preclini cal in vitro and xeno graft model studies on DiFi carcinoma cells (colon cancer) and HN5 (head and neck) tumor cells which do not show treatment of NSCLC For example, data indica ting that a carrier is required for the administration of28 an oral drug of this nature, or other evidence indicating that the authors always or necessarily utili zed carriers in their form ulations. 38with erlotinib. (D.I. 227 at 847:20-849:8) Sandler testified regarding the difference between treatment of an act ual tumor and a xenograft model, which is a human tumor that is changed and modified and transferred to animals lacking immune systems for study. The actual tumor has more genetic variability, often with genetic mutations, than cell line s using a xenog raft m odel, which are more uniform and lack interactions with other bodily systems. ( D.I. 227 at 847:20-850:15) According to Sandler, \"the correlation between activity seen in x enograft models and that ultimately in humans is quite poor.\" ( Id. at 850:16-24) 62. Ratain agreed that the xenograft tests disclosed in this abstract were done on tumor models, not human patients. (D.I. 224 at 142:19-146:11) There was no \"treatment\" of NSCLC in a mammal as recited by claim 53. ( Id. at 146:4-7 (\"[ T]hose are not treatment. Those are experiments\")) For the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that Mylan has not met its burden t o prove anticipation. 2. Obviousness a. Mylan's evidence 63. Mylan asserts t hat, \"by t he time of the purport ed claimed inventio n [November 2000], the idea of tr eating NSCL C with erlotinib was pub licly known through multiple sources, includi ng plaintiffs' own discl osures, and a person of ordinary skill in the art had a r easonable expectation of success in using erlotin ib to treat NSCLC.\" ( D.I. 232 at 54) Mylan does not present its obviousness case in terms of specific proffered combinations, rather, it m akes its argument in broad term s and lists collections of references it argues support each point. In summary: CWhile the '498 patent does not include the term \"NSCLC,\" \"many other 39prior art r eferences made it clear that EGFR inhibitors\u2014and erlotinib in particular\u2014were being made as therapeutic dosi treating NSCLC .\" In addition to the '498 patent and 1998 Cold Spring Harbor Abstract, \"[ n]umerous publications also disclosed the correlation between EGFR TEVAE RLOT0127069 [ C\"[P]laintiffs' own documents the develop ment of erlotinib for treating NSCLC.\" (DTX-8, it inhibits EGFR in a potent and selective manner; it is effective against EGFR-overexpressi ng tumors implanted in mice; and its dose ranges for humans will li kely be between 50 and 500 mg.\" C\"[B]ecause of the known association of EGFR with NSCLC and the lack of any similar association wi th SCLC, a person of ordinary skill in the art would immediatel y think of NSCLC in the context of an EGFR inhibi tor erlotinib.\" 232 at 54-57) 64. Mylan does not specifically address each possibl e combination of the aforementioned evidence. Certain of the references are addressed in Mylan's cited testimony in support of its position, as follows. ( Id.) Ratain testified that DTX-414, a chapter from the book entitled \"Lung Cancer\" (1993), provided that \"EGF r eceptors. . . were found on non-small cell lun g cancer lines, and were absent on small cell li nes.\" The conclusio ns of this work \"r eally was that EGFR was found on squamous carcinoma of the lung, was found in adenocarcinoma of the lung, and was not found on small cell 40carcinoma of the lung.\" ( D.I. 224 at 74:20-77:8) The second (1998) edition of this book (DTX-433) provided that EGFR pathways are overexpressed in NSCLC tumors and not in SCLC tumors. ( Id. at 106:3-108:15) 29 65. Mylan also cites to Ratain's testimony regarding DTX-3, a 1996 publication from t he British Journal of Cancer entitled \"Exp ression of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in Human Lung Tumors.\" This article noted that \"monoclonal antibod ies against the EGFR may be helpful diagno stically in differentiating small cel l from non- small cell lung cancer and may also be important in elucidating biolo gical differences in primary lung cancer . . . because they saw EGFR only in non-small cell lung cancer.\" (D.I. 224 at 78:23-79:25) Another article, published in the British Medical Bul letin in 1991 (DTX-2), also stated that t he EGF receptor is not overexpressed in SCLC. ( Id. at 80:1-81:23) Finally, European patent No. 0 566 226 A1 (DTX-102) taught the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhi bitors for t he treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, a type of SCLC. ( Id. at 81:24-83:14) Karen Ferrante (\"Ferrante\" ), an inventor of the '221 patent, testified (by deposition) that if she \"saw expression of EGFR and lung cancer together, [her] mind [would] leap to non-small cell lung cancer.\" (D.I. 227 at 926:12-18) 66. Also with respect to the disclosures of t he prior art, Mylan cites testimony by Ratain regarding two abstracts by Pfizer and OSI. The first discloses that erlotinib is effective in the HN5 tumor line (\"an overexpressing model\") at the equivalent to a dose of 50 milligrams a day in a human. (D.I . 224 at 88:3-15; DTX-8, Abstract No. 4249) OSI objected to the foregoing testimony as being outside the scope of Ratain's29 expert report. 41The second abstract suggests that a dose as high as 500 milligrams per day could be given, and provides that erlotinib \"has potential for the treatment of tumors that are dependent on the EGFR pathway for proliferation.\" (D.I. 224 at 88:18-89:11; DTX-8, Abstract 4248) \"Inhibitors of Tyrosine Kinase \") \"discusses progress with erlotinib, stating that it was disclosed at the 1997 conference of the AACR [a]nd filing, OSI stat ed that CP358774 (erlotinib)30 targets a variety of cancers, including NSC LC. (D.I. 224 at 110:20-24; DTX-427) b. OSI' s evidence 67. Both Ratain and OSI's expert, Sandler, agreed that there were no prior ar t tests conducted with erlotinib on NSCL C cell line s. (D.I . 227 at 849:13-850:24, 853:21-23; D.I. 224 at 142:19-146:7) The 1998 Cold Spring Harbor Abstract describes preclinical in vitro and xenograft model studies on DiFi carcenoma cells (colon cancer) and HN5 (head and neck) tumor cells. (DTX-79; DI. 227 at 847:20-849:8) As discussed above, Sand ler testified that xenograft models differ f rom actual tumors, and there is \"poor\" cor relation between the two. (D.I. 227 at 847:20-850:24) 68. OSI also points to Sandler's testimony that several other of Mylan's cited references disclose preclini cal in vitro tests and test s in xenograft models. (D.I. 227 at 854:2-24 (regarding DTX-8) (head and neck cancer xenog raft m odels, one NSCL C xenog raft but not with erlotinib); id. at 853:2-853:23 (regarding DTX-34) (head and neck OSI objected to Mylan's use of a 10-K filing as prior art; t he court noted the30 objection. In view of its holding , the court need not resolve the evidentiary issues raised by OSI. 42xenog raft m odels); id. at 855:30-25 (regarding DTX-389) (head and neck cancer in vitro tests with erlotinib)) 69. The '498 patent provides an exempla ry (and broad) r ange of in vitro data 50(IC = 0.001-30 \u00ecM) and generally references treatm ent of a \"var iety of human tumors (renal, liver, kidney, bladder, breast, gastr ic, ovarian, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, lung, vulval, neck tumors).\" (JTX-3 at col. 14, ll. 1-30, col. 15, ll. 3-10) Sandler testified that, while \"lung\" cancer was listed as an applicatio n, a person of ordinary skill in the art would not expect to achieve success in lu ng cancer with erlotinib specifical ly, one of 100 different31 compounds disclose d. (D.I . 227 at 845:17-847:12 (the '498 patent is \" extremely broad\")) 70. With respect to the disclosures that EGFR pathways are overexpressed in NSCLC tumors, OSI argues that t he \"mere fact that NSCLC overexpresses EGFR did not suggest to a person of skill that erlotinib woul d be useful to treat NSCLC .\" (D.I. 233 at 56) Ratain conceded that the notion that a tumor which overexpressed EGFR wou ld respond to EGFR inhibitors was a hypothesis that was in question in 1999. (D.I. 224 at 138:2-9 (\"one skilled in the art did not understand the clinical signi ficance of overexpressio n of (\"the prognostic significance of overexpressio n in lung cancer tissue was unresolved \" and \"poorly understood in normal Even assuming that lung cancer is synonymous with NSC LC. While evidence31 was presented on both sides of the issue, the court's decision does not require expli cit findings in this regard. 43and diseased states\")) Excerpts from several of Mylan's proffered prior art references confirm this testimony, for example: C\"Taken as a whole, the[ ] st udies suggest the overexpression of EFGR and its ligand TGF- \u00e1 is a frequent event, occurring in at least half of all NSC LC but does not clearly correlate with clinical or pathological indicators of aggressive tumor behavior.\" ( DTX-443 at 135) C\"Ultimately, clinical studie s are required to determ ine the prevalence of human tumors that are dependent on EGFR for proliferation, as well as the clinical toleration of an inhibitor of the of in lung cancer tissue is unresolved. Overexpression of EGF receptor has been reported to correlate with poor prognosis [ ] or to have no prognostic significance [ ].\" (DTX-365 at 369) Sandler testified as to these references and concluded that there is no proof t hat overexpressio n of EGFR is the cause of NSCLC and, commensurately, a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have had a reasonable expectation that inhibi ting EGFR would result in the treatment of NSCLC. (D.I . 227 at 837:2-840:11) 71. OSI also points to evidence of secondary considerations of nonobviousness. With respect to t he failure of others, between 1990-2005, only seven of 1,631 drugs studied in Phase II for NSCLC obtained FD A approval. (PTX-124) Almost 90% of Phase III tr ials in oncol ogy failed and only abo ut 5% of new oncology compounds went from human t rial to FDA approval. ( Id.; D.I. 227 at 810:20-813:14) a vast number of small molecule EGFR inhibi tors have been patented, only erlotinib has been fully approved by the FDA. (D.I. 227 at 828:8-11; PTX-56) Similarly, Ratain agreed that there was a need in the art f or an effective second-line therapy (to chemotherapy) for NSCLC ; Tarceva\u00ae is such a treatm ent. (PTX-119; D.I. 228 at 1034:17-1036:11) 44c. Discussion 72. Mylan's two primary r eferences against the '221 patent are the '498 patent and the 1998 Cold Sprin g Harbor Abstract. As discussed above, the '498 patent lists \"lung\" cancer among possible cancers for which 100 disclo sed compounds (includi ng erlotinib) are useful. Mylan does not advance a persuasive rationale for why a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to select erlotinib for the tr eatment of NSCLC, a specific subset of \"lung\" cancer generally. Notwithstanding, the court32 viewed San dler's testimony on the lack of any reasonable expectation of success to be persuasive. (D.I. 227 at 845:17-847:12) See Eisai , 533 F.3d at 1359 (\" To the extent an art is unpredictable, as the chemical arts oft en are, KSR's focus on [ ] 'identified , predictable solutio ns' may present a difficult hurdle because potential solution s are less likely to be genuin ely predictable\") (citation omitted). 73. With respect to the 1998 Cold Spring Harbor Abstract, the court found credible Sand ler's testimony that there is poor correlation between xe nograft models and the treatment of actual human tumors. (D.I. 227 at 847:20-850:24) Notwithstanding , the cells used in this study were not NSCLC cancer cells. 74. The court also agrees with OSI t hat disclosures in the art connecting the overexpressio n of EGFR and NSCLC did not suggest to a person of ordinary skill in the art to use er lotinib, given the absence of proof t hat EGFR causes NSCLC . (D.I . 227 at 837:2-840:11) See Li & Co. v. Teva Pharms. USA , Inc., Civ. No. 02-0512, 2004 It is not incumbent on t he court to f ormulate Mylan's best arguments utilizing32 each of Mylan's cited references in the obviousness section of its brief, absent citation to particular testimony illuminating the disclosures of (and value of) those references. 45WL 1724632, *35 (S.D. Ind. July 29, 2004) (No reasonable ex pectation of success where only \"scant information was known about the etiology of [the disease]. Any new method of tr eatment that pr oved to be effective would have been unex pected[.]\") 75. Finally, the court finds persuasive OSI's evidence on secondary considerations of nonobvi ousness. Despite a need in the art for an effective drug for treating NSCLC, there exists an almost insurmountable fail ure rate for new drug candidates. See gen., Monarch Knitting Mach. Corp. v. Sluzer Morat GmbH , 139 F.3d 877, 885 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (\" [g]eneral skepticism of those in the art - not amounting to teaching away - is also releva nt and persuasive evidence of nonobvi ousness\") (citation and internal quotations omitted). Viewing the record as a whole, the court finds that Mylan did not meet its burden to demonstr ate that the '221 patent is invalid as obvious by clear and convincing evidence. III. CONCLUSION 76. In view of t he foregoing, the court concludes that Mylan has not proven, by clear and convincin g evidence, that claims 1, 2, 4, 8, 34, and 35 of t he RE '065 patent are invalid as obvio us in view of the prior art or that claim 53 of the '221 patent is invalid as anticipated or as obvious in view of the prior art. 46IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE OSI PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., ) PFIZER, INC., and GENENTECH INC., ) ) Defendant. ) JUDGMENT IN A CIVIL CASE For the reasons stated in the opinion issued this same date; IT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that judgment be and is hereby entered in favor of plaintiffs OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pfizer, Inc. and Genentech Inc. and against defendant Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.
