Did you know there are two paths to becoming a physician? Allopathic Medicine Doctors of allopathic medicine (MDs) are medical doctors who treat disease and injury using counteractive methods. For example, they will prescribe antibiotics to kill bacteria that have caused an infection. Allopathic physicians often work in public or private hospitals or clinics and many have private practices. Although many allopathic physicians become internists, generalists, or family practitioners, some specialize in other medical fields. Osteopathic Medicine Doctors of osteopathic medicine (DOs) practice a \"whole person\" approach to health care. Osteopathic physicians understand how all the body's systems are interconnected and how each one affects the others. They focus special attention on the musculoskeletal system, which reflects and influences the condition of all other body systems. Osteopathic physicians often work in public or private hospitals or clinics and many have private practices. Although many osteopathic physicians become internists, generalists, or family practitioners, some specialize in other medical fields. DOs and MDs are Alike in Many Ways yBoth DOs and MDs complete four y ears of basic medical education. yAfter medical school, both DOs and MDs obtain gr aduate medical education through internships, residencies, and fellowships. This training lasts three to eight years and prepares DOs and MDs to practice a specialty. yDOs and MDs can choose t o practice in any specialty of medicine\u2014such as pediatrics, family medicine, psychiatry, surgery or ophthalmology. yDOs and MDs must pass compar able examinations to obtain state licensure. yDOs and MDs both pr actice in accredited and licensed health care facilities. Advisement Pre-medicine is not a major. Due to course sequencing and preparation for the MCAT and application, it is recommended to declare your major as early as possible. Medical schools are interested in students who excel in the sciences and mathematics, but you do not have to major in these disciplines. Choose a major/minor that you enjoy and that plays to your strengths. Students should speak with an MPA counselor before declaring a major. It is strongly recommended that you meet with your MPA Counselor and your major advisor each semester before registering for the following semester. Your major advisor is there to prepare you for graduation, while your MPA Counselor is there to prepare you for application. Students who receive scholarships or participate in specialized ETSU programs (such as athletics or Honors College programs) must also seek advisement from those departments. Serious consequences can occur if students fail to meet with advisors (e.g., failure to graduate on time, missing appropriate courses to prepare for the MCAT, etc.).MPA Counselor contact Medical Professions Advisement Office 423-439-5602summer junior Complete medical school prerequisite requirements Build professional relationships with professors, advisors, counselors, and health care professionals for letters of recommendation Community service / volunteer work / job shadowing / engagement in student organizations; Document experiences Choose a major Gain research experience Campus visits to professional schools of interest MCAT prep and exam Committee Evaluation Request letters of recommendation Application Interviewsfreshman summer summer sophomore senior TimelineEmployment Opportunities 756,800 $227,992 812,000jobs in 2018 for specialists in 2018jobs projected in 2024 Median Salary For more information, see the Bureau of Labor Statistics http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/physicians-and-surgeons.htm$204,135 for primary care in 2018 Application Process Students should start preparing for application approximately 18 months prior to when they desire to enter medical school. This process will include University Evaluation, MCAT preparation, and taking the MCAT, followed by application. Most students apply to medical school the summer after their junior year, but students should consult with their MPA Counselor to determine their application timeline. Applications typically open in May; deadlines vary from August through March. Please research your school choices to determine application due dates. Most allopathic medical schools participate in the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS).Most osteopathic medical schools participate in the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS). Many medical schools require or recommend a university committee letter of evaluation during the application process.

RELATED EXPERIENCEStudents are encouraged to explore the medical field through shadowing, employment, and volunteer work. Medical schools want to know that a student has worked in the field, observed what is involved, and still has the desire to continue in that profession. (It is extremely important that students planning to apply to osteopathic medical schools obtain shadowing experiences with a DO.) Quality of exposure is more important than quantity. VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE Medical schools are looking for candidates who express a commitment to community service. Students should seek volunteer projects that focus on giving back to the community. EXTRACURRICULARSThe admissions committees of medical schools are interested in seeing a range of extracurricular activities, especially those d e m a n d i n g a s i g n i fi c a n t l e a d e r s h i p r o l e . S t udents should demonstrate their ability to balance full academic schedules with extracurricular involvement on and off campus and/or through employment opportunities. ETSU has many organizations that students can join. Students should visit ETSU's Student Activities and Organizations office or webpage (etsu.edu/sorc) for more information regarding extracurricular activities. It is not beneficial to simply join an organization; you must demonstrate leadership qualities! ONLINE ETIQUETTEPlease consider personal email addresses when corresponding with professional schools. First impressions are often based on correspondence and email addresses should be appropriate for professional communication. Messages and images sent electronically are reflections of judgment and potential suitability for professional careers. Inappropriate behaviors shared through an accessible venue can be viewed and shared by anyone and may compromise your admission to medical school.*Calculus-based physics (PHYS 2110 and 2030 is recommended for the MCAT philosophy knowledge requirement; it does not fill a General Education requirement.Core Preparation Courses Different schools may have varying prerequisite requirements. It is up to the student to research and ensure the required courses are completed before application to the preferred school(s) of interest. Students should maintain a minimum of 17-19 credit hours per semester.

Complete all pre-requisite courses before taking the MCAT, and consult with your MPA Counselor to develop your MCAT study plan. The MCAT tests four sections: yBiological and Biochemical F oundations of Living Systems yChemical and Physical F oundations of Biological Systems yPsy chological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior yCritical Analysis and Reasoning SkillsGap Year Some students choose to take one or more gap years before applying to medical school.
