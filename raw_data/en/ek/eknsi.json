The aim of this study was to analyze the anti-pertussis vaccination decision-shaping factors in pregnant women during two epidemiological periods: the measles epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Methods: Two groups of pregnant women were invited to be part of a medical education program, having as the main theme the infectious disease risks and their prevention through vaccination. Before launching the program, participants received a 12-item questionnaire. From a total number of 362 pregnant women enrolled in the study, 182 participated in 2019, and 180 participated in 2022. (3) Results: The socio-demographic data revealed that the age of pregnant women participating in medical education programs increased in 2022 by 1.7 years (p < 0.01). In vitro fertilization was reported in a significantly higher proportion (20% in 2022 vs 9.8% in 2019, p < 0.01). Participation in community-initiated educational programs almost doubled during the pandemic time from 18.7% in 2019 to 33.9% in 2022 (p < 0.01).

Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-11-01207)]. A special category was represented by pregnant women in which stress could negatively influence their attitudes and behavior, thus influencing their decisions regarding vaccination during pregnancy [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-01207), 2017-2018 [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-01207)]; in total, 28% of European children below 5 years old were affected by measles. From the beginning of the measles epidemic in Romania until late 2019, 18,578 measles cases were registered, with 10,152 (54.6%) being diagnosed in children under 4 years old. A total number of 64 deaths among children was recorded during this period (2016-2019), most of these cases being diagnosed in unvaccinated children [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-01207)]. At the European level, during the same time frame (2016-2019), there were 93 deaths recorded attributed to measles infections [ [11](#B11-vaccines-11-01207)]. [12](#B12-vaccines-11-01207)]. [13](#B13-vaccines-11-01207)]. Every year, 1.5 million children die because they do not have access to vaccines. Between 2010 and 2020, it is estimated that vaccines and vaccination saved 25 million lives, representing \"five lives saved per minute\" globally [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-01207)]. Despite the recorded results, in the last two decades, increasing opposition to vaccines and vaccination has been reported. Vaccine hesitancy, defined as \"a state of indecisiveness regarding a vaccination decision\" [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-01207), [16](#B16-vaccines-11-01207)], and vaccine refusal, defined as the \"result of ever-changing experience and continual risk assessment\" [ [17](#B17-vaccines-11-01207)], are among the top 10 threats to global health according to World Health Organization [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01207)]. [19](#B19-vaccines-11-01207), [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01207), [21](#B21-vaccines-11-01207)]. [22](#B22-vaccines-11-01207)]. [23](#B23-vaccines-11-01207)]. Recent publications, which focus on communication and public relations, showed that the fake news phenomenon, described as a new type of \"arms race\" of the 21st century, will change Generation Omega's way of life, their attitude, and their essential decision-making processes during their teenage years and that it will also change the communication and social interaction skills of future adults [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-01207), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01207)]. Approximately 80% of all internet users search for health information. Considering the unregulated environment, misinformation can easily be transmitted. This has the potential to lead, in the end, to negative results, behavior changes, misjudgment, the spread of doubt, and fake news on internet channels, for parents and even for a part of healthcare personnel who are not directly involved in immunization activities [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-01207), [27](#B27-vaccines-11-01207)]. An important step to lower parental vaccine hesitancy resides in the training of the medical human resources involved in prevention, especially in the communication of the protective role of vaccination. Students and residents remain the first groups in need of training for optimal patient-centered communication starting from universities during residency and oriented towards understanding patients' needs and expectations and towards understanding the risk of infectious diseases and the protective role of the vaccination act [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-01207)]. This type of education could help young doctors reduce their possible hesitancy regarding infectious disease prevention through new vaccines or new innovative techniques of vaccine production [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-01207)], a process similar to that which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2. Materials and Methods [Supplementary Files S1 and S2](#app1-vaccines-11-01207)). Participants were informed regarding data protection and Medical Academy Ethics Committee approval. The questions were structured to analyze socio-demographic data (age, living environment, and educational level), pregnancy follow-up (gestational age, number of offspring, and conceiving method), interest in participating in medical education programs during pregnancy (including preferred forms of education), infectious disease risk perception gaps and preferred topics, personal attitudes regarding pertussis vaccine acceptance (VA) during pregnancy, and agreement/disagreement to receive informative materials connected to the main theme of the present medical education program. [27](#B27-vaccines-11-01207)]; evaluation of vaccination coverage for children aged 0-1 year old in Romania, with focus on the specific epidemiological context [ [13](#B13-vaccines-11-01207)]; and the aim of the current study, the shaping factors of the decision-making process of anti-pertussis vaccination in pregnant women during this time frame and changes in vaccine acceptance. 3. Results 3.1. Socio-Demographic Data [Table 1](#vaccines-11-01207-t001)and [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-01207-f001)a summarize the socio-demographic aspects related to the age, environment, and educational level of the pregnant women. The average age of the pregnant women was higher for the 2022 sample, with a mean difference of 1.72 years (CI 95% 0.68-2.75 years, p < 0.01). The main difference, based on age group, was observed for the 25 to 30 year old pregnant women, which, in 2019, represented almost 40%, while, in 2022, they represented approximately 16%. 3.2. Pregnancy Follow-Up [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-01207-f001)b). In 2022, the sample presented a higher proportion of pregnant women with a higher pregnancy age, 90% being in the third trimester, while, for the 2019 sample, most of them were in the second trimester (approximately 81%). [Table 2](#vaccines-11-01207-t002)). 3.3. Educational Objectives [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-01207-f002)a). At the same time, the percentage of pregnant women that previously took part in parenting programs raised during the pandemic time, going up from 18.7% in 2019 to 33.9% in 2022 (p < 0.01) ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-01207-f002)). [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-01207-f002)a depicts the intention to participate in parenting classes, which was significantly higher when compared to the data from [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-01207-f002)b, where the actual previous participation in other educational programs was confirmed by the pregnant women. [Table 3](#vaccines-11-01207-t003)), except for a decrease in the interest of enrolled pregnant women regarding infectious disease prevention (p < 0.01), where a 15% decrease in the interest in this topic was observed. 3.4. Personal Attitudes Regarding Pertussis Vaccine Acceptance during Pregnancy [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-01207-f003)). A five-fold increase was observed in the percentage of pregnant women hesitant towards pertussis vaccination during pregnancy (from 7.1% in 2019 to 35% in 2022) together with an almost three-fold increase in the percentage of pregnant women disagreeing with pertussis vaccination (from 7.7% in 2019 to 20.6% in 2022). [Table 4](#vaccines-11-01207-t004)). The model included the following variables: the year of the cohort, educational level, and environment as nominal independent variables and the pregnant women's age as a continuous independent variable. We considered the \"Agree\" status to be the reference category, and we compared the \"Mostly agree\" category and the \"Disagree\" category to the \"Agree\" category. 4. Discussion [30](#B30-vaccines-11-01207)]. The World Health Organization 2023 global initiative \"Health for All\" promotes, among other aspects, the same solutions [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-01207)]. A recent study, that took place between 2020 and 2022 in Bucharest (a metropolitan South-East area of Romania) and had as one of its main purposes the analysis of protective antibodies' levels against pertussis among a cohort of pregnant women, showed a concerning waning humoral immunity against Bordetella pertussis infections in 91.9% of the pregnant women [ [32](#B32-vaccines-11-01207)]. [6](#B6-vaccines-11-01207), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-01207), [33](#B33-vaccines-11-01207)]. In the United States, during the measles epidemic, public health responses included, among other measures, communication campaigns, the delivery of printed materials, and media releases. All these methods were used as a means of providing information on the disease and prevention through vaccination, which was adapted to the communities under high risk [ [34](#B34-vaccines-11-01207)]. All successful education programs were also based and structured according to the main needs that were identified for pregnant women [ [35](#B35-vaccines-11-01207)]. [36](#B36-vaccines-11-01207)]. After a few months, online education became ubiquitous, and people largely adopted the new teaching and learning methods [ [1](#B1-vaccines-11-01207), [2](#B2-vaccines-11-01207), [3](#B3-vaccines-11-01207), [4](#B4-vaccines-11-01207), [5](#B5-vaccines-11-01207)]. As a result, access to training programs was improved. This was also observed in our present study, which showed that the percentage of pregnant women taking part in parenting programs doubled (compared with 2019) during the COVID-19 pandemic. [37](#B37-vaccines-11-01207)]. Interestingly, despite the higher grade of previous participation in multiple educational programs dedicated to pregnant women, an important decrease in vaccine acceptance was reported in our study, leading to the possibility that, during the later years, other factors were more important in shaping the opinion of pregnant women with respect to vaccine acceptance than the education provided by trained medical staff [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-01207), [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01207), [38](#B38-vaccines-11-01207)]. [39](#B39-vaccines-11-01207), [40](#B40-vaccines-11-01207), [41](#B41-vaccines-11-01207)]. [42](#B42-vaccines-11-01207)]. We conducted multinomial logistic regression to control for these factors (age and level of education), together with the living environment and the cohort they were part of (2019 or 2022), to identify the independent role each of these factors had in shaping their anti-pertussis vaccination decision. We observed that the change from the status of \"Agree\" to \"Mostly agree\" was influenced in a statistically significant way by the year of the cohort (pregnant women in 2022 having the odds of being more reluctant) but also by the level of education (a lower level of education increased the odds of being more reluctant to vaccination). When comparing the difference between vaccine acceptance and vaccine refusal, we observed that the year of the cohort had a statistically significant influence (odds of refusing vaccination were higher for the 2022 cohort) but that the age of the pregnant women also did (older women had higher odds of refusing anti-pertussis vaccination). We thus observed that the epidemic period and the pandemic time had an independent, statistically significant role in lowering the anti-pertussis vaccination acceptance rate during pregnancy, influencing both vaccine hesitancy and vaccine refusal. [32](#B32-vaccines-11-01207)]. [43](#B43-vaccines-11-01207)]. [44](#B44-vaccines-11-01207)], especially anxiety and stress, caused mainly by concern for the well-being of the unborn child. Studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic identified IVF as being positively associated with vaccine hesitancy [ [45](#B45-vaccines-11-01207)]. [46](#B46-vaccines-11-01207)]. A huge quantity of information in various forms was available online during the COVID-19 pandemic [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-01207), [3](#B3-vaccines-11-01207), [4](#B4-vaccines-11-01207), [5](#B5-vaccines-11-01207), [34](#B34-vaccines-11-01207), [47](#B47-vaccines-11-01207), [48](#B48-vaccines-11-01207)]. Romania for both the measles [ [48](#B48-vaccines-11-01207), [49](#B49-vaccines-11-01207)] and the COVID-19 pandemic [ [7](#B7-vaccines-11-01207), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-01207), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01207)]. In the present study we noticed that, despite the increase in interest in participation in educational programs stated by pregnant women from 2019, the actual participation in such programs was lower compared to the 2022 cohort. The most reasonable explanation for this finding is related to the change in the way that the educational programs were conducted. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the educational programs were conducted frontally, while, following the pandemic occurrence, most of the educational programs dedicated to pregnant women used the online environment. This change, together with the restrictions imposed on the population, facilitated online in general, during the measles epidemic was generated by combined factors (an insufficient vaccine supply, vaccine reluctance, and sub-optimal communication addressed to high-risk clusters), vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19 pandemic was mainly caused by the infodemic [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-01207), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01207)] and also by the inconsistency of pandemic preparedness and its management [ [1](#B1-vaccines-11-01207), [3](#B3-vaccines-11-01207), [4](#B4-vaccines-11-01207), [5](#B5-vaccines-11-01207)]. [54](#B54-vaccines-11-01207)], tobacco [ [55](#B55-vaccines-11-01207)], and drug [ [56](#B56-vaccines-11-01207)] addiction among pregnant women. Addictions severely influence the pregnant woman and the future child's health, influencing the pregnant woman's ability to make the right decisions for her and the future child. Each of these products can expose both the pregnant woman and the future child to severe disorders of the immune system, in utero death, premature birth, malformations, and severe immune deficits, generating huge social costs and efforts for mothers' and infants' recovery. Mother-child interdependence remains a great challenge, especially in managing the presented situations. Early preventive medical education for pregnant women could be one of the solutions that could reduce the risks associated with addictions.
