Additionally, as our attention gets divided between our online and offline lives, it's difficult to concentrate on a single task for a lengthy period of time. Even as I write this story, I've checked Instagram twice, replied to a few emails, played with my dog, and taken a couple of phone calls. None of the above needed my immediate attention, but scattered focus is a default setting these days. But even as we call [social media](https://www.vogue.in/wellness/content/how-to-counter-digital-anxiety-truths-about-social-media-instagram-dating-online) digital heroin for its addictive capabilities, the root cause of poor concentration goes much deeper than just screen time. \"Too much thinking takes away concentration,\" says Dr Sharmistha Dattagupta, certified life and leadership coach and founder of [Dna Coaching](https://www.dana-coaching.com/). \"This is expended by certain habits like paying too much attention to our thoughts.\" She compares thoughts to a radio program that is always running in the background. \"Unknowingly we turn up the volume in that radio and start believing what it says,\" Dattagupta explains. Ultimately, focus and concentration come from practice, which includes learning to tune out the constant background noise (aka, your thoughts). And like every other activity that becomes more refined with practice and repetition, the mind too can be trained to become more focused. We got a yoga guru, a life coach and an Ayurvedic expert to spell out how you can do it. Shift your focus Dattagupta likes to think of thoughts as guests in your living room. \"If a guest was negative, would you make them comfortable by feeding them them snacks, or would you rather show them the door?,\" she asks. So every time a thought makes you uncomfortable, ask yourself: Do I really need this? How does it benefit me? \"To get into habit of shifting your focus, begin first by observing how you think, without engaging with every thought that comes your way,\" she advises. [Meditation](https://www.vogue.in/wellness/content/meditation-types-how-to-find-the-right-one-transcendental-meditation) is a handy tool for this, because it trains the mind to observe thoughts from a neutral position and then shift focus to either your breath, a mantra or a visual. Stay connected to your body \"A large part of our lack of focus is because we are never really connected to our bodies,\" says Dattagupta. She explains that even though we are working out in increasing numbers, the aim of exercosomg shouldn't be about getting that ever elusive six-pack. \"Such a goal is rarely calming for the mind,\" she explains. Instead, try to connect to your body during physical activities\u2014be it by feeling the stretch during [yoga](https://www.vogue.in/wellness/content/yoga-poses-asanas-at-home-how-to-start-and-everything-you-should-know), or trying an at-home HIIT sequence, working beyond trying to just hit new personal bests. Count backwards For Delhi-based yoga guru and founder of The Yoga Studio, Seema Sondhi, backward counting serves as one of her favourite meditative tools, and she uses it to help her students (of all levels) too. \"You can do this as a daily practice or as a tool to realign your focus when you're feeling [scattered or anxious](https://www.vogue.in/content/how-to-deal-with-anxiety-when-you-are-feeling-overwhelmed),\" she says. To practice it, count your breath backwards from 50. Every time you feel like your mind has run away, begin again. Just like exercise tones the body, this meditation technique trains the brain to become more focused and attentive. \"You can use counting in many ways,\" she adds. \"You can also count the seconds it takes for every inhale and exhale. Then [inhale and exhale](https://www.vogue.in/content/3-pranayama-breathing-exercises-to-calm-your-body-and-mind-vogue) for an equal amount of time\u2014for instance three seconds each.\" If you're feeling particularly anxious, Sondhi recommends an extended exhale, which works to relax the mind. \"Inhale to the count of three and exhale to the count of six,\" she says. Try flame meditation \"Tratak is a known yogic technique to not only improve concentration, but also enhance the health of your eyes,\" explains Sondhi. In this type of meditation, you need to find a point of focus\u2014it could be a bindi on a wall, a visual, or a flame, which is the preferred object for most yogis. \"The ideal time to practice this is during dawn or dusk. Make sure to keep any source of light (like a window) behind you, as the candle or diya will be in front of you,\" she adds. Keep all the lights in your room switched off so you can focus on the flame. \"Stare at it for as long as you can, going deeper and deeper, observing the outer shape and colours, the wick and then the centre part of the flame.\" Close your eyes only when they begin to water for a few seconds and then open them again. \"Practice this for five to 10 minutes everyday. Eventually you need to go into a short meditation, visualising the flame between your eyebrows,\" she says. Oil your brain \"The brain is oily or unctuous in nature, so it benefits from fats like cow's ghee or butter,\" says Dr Mahesh Patil, a Pune-based Ayurvedic physician. He explains that according to Ayurveda, the main cause of a change in focus or attention is increased [vata dosha](https://www.vogue.in/wellness/content/ayurveda-health-tips-vata-pitta-kapha-dosha-foodhall-arqa-ayurveda-products-mumbai-delhi), which is dry in nature. \"In my practice I have also seen a lack of focus happen due to physical and mental fatigue,\" he says. If the cause is fatigue, Dr Patil recommends several herbs that work on the brain like ashwagandha and jyotishmati, which comes in the medhya or the mind category of herbs. \"You can take five to seven drops of jyotishmati oil with warm water or milk before bedtime, or 10-15 drops of almond oil to energise the brain.\" He also suggests [ashwagandha](https://www.vogue.in/content/health-tips-for-summer-best-ayurvedic-herbs-to-cool-body) ghritam\u2014which is ashwagandha simmered in ghee, taken either early morning or at bedtime. \"Even an oil bath or head massage with bhringraj oil works wonders on the mind,\" he says. We know now that anything applied on the body is directly absorbed within, so applying herbal oils with cooling herbs such as brahmi and ashwagandha is believed to be stimulating for the mind. Practice bhramari pranayam Dr Patil has found bhramari pranayam (also known as the humming bee breath) to be extremely relaxing for the mind. \"The vibrations during bhramari stimulate the brain tissue, reduce stress and create a soothing feeling.\" Sit with your eyes closed to practice bhramari, and close your ears tightly with your thumbs. Then, place your forefingers on your eyelids to keep them shut, and position your middle fingers on the sides of the nose, ring fingers on the corners of the mouth and little fingers underneath the jaw. This symbolically closes out the entire world. Breathe in and then exhale softly humming. You can also create an 'om' sound without opening your mouth. Practice for five to 10 minutes every night before you go to bed. Vasudha Rai has been writing on beauty and wellness for more than 15 years.
