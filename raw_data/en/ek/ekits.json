Just think about it. Your brain uses the nervous system to communicate commands that result in action. One part of your nervous system is the sympathetic nervous system, or the SNS. This is the part of the nervous system responsible for handling your body's instinct on fight or flight when you encounter a significant stressor or danger. Remember those lessons from school (when you encounter a stress your body decides to 'fight the stress, or run from the stress')? Dangerous situations will increase your SNS activity, but so can stress. When activated, SNS will increase your cortisol (a stress handling chemical), heart rate, blood pressure, and total lipids. Meanwhile, things like your digestion, serotonin production, short-term memory, and overall concentration take a nosedive. In other words, the more active the SNS, the more likely you are to have declining health in a number of areas. Whenever you have a subluxation (a misalignment in the spine), one of the many results is that your SNS activity is increased. In other words, the more subluxations you have, the more likely you are to have anxiety. How can chiropractic care help? Chiropractic care provides a natural, safe option in terms of changing the health of the chemistry inside your body. When people have anxiety, we encourage you to give chiropractic care a chance. Chiropractic patients report experience not only reduced anxiety but also pain relief, improved digestion, serotonin levels, and concentration, among other benefits. "}
