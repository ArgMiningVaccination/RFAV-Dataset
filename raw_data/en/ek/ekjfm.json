We believe this is because of our unique approach to total wellness. One of the benefits of an integrated approach to caring for you is that we're able to use the latest developments in technology to provide results that were not possible before. I went through several sessions of Ultrasound, E-Stim, Arm Ergometer, Ice Therapy, and Stretching and Strengthening exercises. My strength in my shoulder increased, my range of motion greatly improved, and the skills needed to go through everyday life that I lost were regained through this excellent program. I sought the help of Chiropractic. After a short time, and a few adjustments later, my allergies had improved drastically! All of my symptoms had diminished, and I do not have to take the medication anymore. Thank you. Chiropractic care was recommended to us, after hearing how much it had helped others we were ready to try it out. Since our first visit with Dr. Dennison Tucker has started sleeping better and seems so much more content throughout the day. It has been truly life-changing for both Tucker and us! At Integrated Health Services, we're renowned for achieving superb results in even the most challenging circumstances. We believe this is because of our unique approach to total wellness.
