Phytochrome exists in two forms, Pr and Pfr and has peak absorptions at 660nm and 730nm red-range light. It's the conversion of the pigment between the two forms that ultimately influences the plant growth, the morphology, flowering, and germination.

The American Africans were entitled to slave since 1619 when the first black slaves were introduced in North America to help with the production of crops such as tobacco. Throughout the American colonies, slavery was practiced, and the black Americans were used to help build the economic foundation of the country. However, after the agricultural decline, the African Americans were seen to have no economic benefit to the farmers. Consequently, they engaged into other economic benefits that shaped the northern economy. For instance, when the geography and climate affected the agricultural activities in the northern colonies, slaves engaged into ... Wind is a major limiting factor in the marine ecosystem. Wind affects waves, dune system, sediment transportation, currents, and weather. Wind has profound effects on the waves. As wind move over the surface of the oceans, the abrasions between the wind and the water surfaces lead to formation of waves. The speed of wind also affects the size of the waves formed. When the speed of the wind is very high, the abrasion between the wind and the surface of the water increases leading to huge waves. In the event that the speed of the wind is low, the waves ...

Intermodal transportation is one of the prime trends of supply chains impacting the contemporary transportation industry. In the recent past, higher demand, greater government oversight, higher fuel costs, and driver shortages have all squeezed capacity in the transportation industry (\"Vielhaber\" n.p.). All of these situations have multiple implications on everything ranging from timing of cargo to pricing. Therefore, executives on the other hand are seeking for a solution to achieve and maintain a supply chain that is cost-effective. One solution that they have found is intermodal transportation (\"Vielhaber\" n.p.). In the modern global community, it has become outdated for carriers to ...

In O'Connor's \"A Good Man is hard to find\" and Lawrence's \"The Rocking Horse Winner,\" both writers look at the destructive nature of the family.

These disagreements often lead to negative reactions to the members of the family. In \"The Rocking Horse Winner,\" the story centers on a young boy's need to experience a positive relationship with his mother. He tries to win her love, but fails in his attempts. Similarly, the grandmother in \" ... America has a poverty problem, but it is a problem that it is reluctant to admit to. As the research that will be cited in this reflection shows, it is a growing problem. Part of the ideals that define America is the idea that anyone who works hard can be prosperous. Barbara Enrenreich's experience working jobs with the working poor suggest that the hard work they must do to survive is so demoralizing, that it will become difficult to see jobs available to the working poor as anything other than poverty traps. Charles Murray in his article \"The New American Divide\" ... Every person has its own concept of a good life. It is individual for everybody. In America, there is a notion 'the American dream'. According to Mark Robert Rank, \"it is a road map for the way we often envision the course of our lives\" (Rank 1). According to this idea, every American has opportunities to achieve success. The essence of the American dream is that each person has the ability and energy to succeed in life in an honest way. In my opinion, the desire to succeed is one of the main drivers of the good life.

A pretty, articulate African-American woman stands before a University of Chicago audience to deliver a lecture on her latest book. She is Michelle Alexander, a highly acclaimed civil rights attorney and Associate Law Professor at Ohio State University. The Stanford Law School graduate is the author of the book, which discusses the modern effects of a viciously racist Jim Crow system on today's society. Significant patterns have continued to emerge regarding racist voting practices in the United States. Is it little wonder, given the historical debauchery that has occurred? Various inconsistencies in prison policy practices (and voting rights discrepancies) have engaged critical ... Human life entirely depends on water for survival. Water has many uses ranging from domestic to commercial. Each state in America has a right to access adequate water that is enough to sustain its populace. However, in the Southeast where swamps, rivers, the heavy thunderstorms, high humidity, and marshes are common, few individuals thought that water scarcity would be a major problem. The urban growth in the three states Georgia, Florida, and Alabama and the recent droughts in the last decades stir fierce battles between the partisan states. The paper describes water wars between the three states, presents a viable solution, and ... ASTRACT Racism is a serious issue that is deeply imbedded in the American Criminal Justice System.

Various authors describe the value of human life by saying; race does not exist, but rather merely human beings (Gordon 1983; Wilson and Moore 2003). All humans are unique despite their social background, ethnic race as well as the language they speak. Therefore, this raises a question as to why is there is a social divide amongst humans, and why it continues to develop over the years.

Growing up in a single-parent family, I learned from an early age to collaborate with my mother and my brother in everything we did. Many times, while organizing the household's choruses, the activities within our family were very well divided. On a higher level, we all knew our functions: while I and my brother were responsible with learning, our mother was the provider of our household. My mother was not quite the prototype of a traditional mother who is dependent on the domestic sphere, taking care of her housewife's activities. Although she made sure to also organize and coordinate the ... Introduction Business cycle refers to economic patterns over time occasioned by repetitive contractions and expansions. The patterns are as a result of growth or increase in economic activities and slow down of the growth rates, or in extreme conditions, negative changes in the size of the Gross Domestic Product, measured year to year. Ideally, the economy would expand rapidly to a point where it peaks the contracts to a low point (the trough) before growing again. Expansion results to a boom while contraction leads to a recession, a period of economic challenges. The different stages of the business cycle have different effects on unemployment. ... Why was the plan proposed? Lack of enough health care facilities offering unique services contributes to the poor state-of-health care practices experienced today.

The rate at which chronic diseases shorten lives of people in Florida is worrying. In order to reduce the number of deaths from chronic diseases in ... Environmental education involves a lifelong experience that is geared towards understanding how the natural environments function. It includes those efforts involved in teaching human beings on how they can manage their ecosystems and behavior if they are to live sustainably.

As cities across the country and all around the world continue to grow and expand their borders, both physical and cultural, a question lands in citizens' minds, although it is hardly a new one: where is the city going? In the essays in which this paper is founded on, there are at least two major points to make regarding the shift in demographics: the first the phenomenon of gentrification (which is to say, when an urban community changes towards wealthier residents or businesses, making the property more valuable in the market); and, secondly, there is Richard Florida's theory regarding ... Immigrants form a very important part of Florida's population and culture. They represent a third of the total workforce in the region and mostly work in the construction industry, the agriculture sector and other informal sectors (Eisenhauer, 5). Many of these immigrants do not possess legal documents and work permits making them vulnerable to exploitation. For many years they have complained of harassment and exploitation, but cannot air their grievances through the legal system for fear of repatriation. This makes their complaint irrelevant and ineffective. For many years the workers have been denied the chance to form labor unions that ...

In the United States, citrus is produced in California, Texas, Arizona and Florida. Of the aforementioned states, Florida is the biggest producer of citrus fruits in America accounting up to 70% of the total U.S production (Halbert, Susan & Manjunath, ... The structures of the cities before the 1920s consisted of unflattering, slum-like structures that casted the cities in a bad light. They were not efficient to live and from the 1920s; changes had to be made. Of all the ways to renovate the cities, the one that stood out the most was building the city structures from the ground up. According to Short, urban renewal needs to start from the ground up (Short, 299). The urbanization of the cities worldwide started to take effect from the 1940s to the 1970s. The main idea behind this urbanization was to transform ... Dr. Smith can be charged with aggravated battery. Aggravated battery, according to s 784.045 of 2014 Florida Statutes, is committed when great bodily harm results, or when deadly weapon is used. Great bodily harm was defined in Coronado v.

Florida Senate bill 7071, would authorise the nurse practitioners to administer, dispense and prescribe medicinal drugs, and authorize to perform the practice, without physician supervision or protocol.

When there are no information asymmetries, taxes or transaction cost involved, hedging will not add any value to a firm because shareholders or companies can diversify their portfolio in such a way that their overall risk will be totally hedged (Lin and Chang 2006). However, the real world is far from the Modigliani and Miller model. In practice, we see imperfections in the financial market. This imperfection may actually create a rationale to reduce the volatility of earnings for a firm through hedging. Many empirical ... Citation McCall v. United States, No. SC11-1148 (Fla.

It may not come as a surprise to say that, as humans reach out in search of food and shelter, it is the environment around them that is being abused. As man's needs grow, so too does the pressure on the environment grow, as a result of which, an ecological imbalance is created unconsciously. And once an ecological imbalance occurs, a series of events are triggered that culminates in large scale loss of life and property. There is no doubt the importance the environment has on life on this planet, but man himself, pressed for space, finds no other option but ... [University]Introduction Perhaps no clause in the U.S. constitution has been so misconstrued and debated as the Second Amendment. In fact, even the Supreme Court could not make up their mind as to the true meaning of \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed\". A decisive interpretation to this clause has been quite elusive. Since its ratification, only a few cases have found its way to the Supreme Court while the court's decision has not helped clarify the matter more than being ... Introduction On 17th to 21st, November, the Miami town of Florida experienced widespread demonstrations during the Free Trade Area of the America's Summit (FTAA) held there.

From a stop and search, to vehicle looks at activity stops, to sentencing and the requisition of capital punishment, African Americans excessively are reached by the criminal equity framework in bunch ways. Outstandingly, discovering a racial difference is not synonymous with discovering racial disparity. African Americans are more prone to live in thick, devastated spots, and neediness and isolation are unmistakably joined to criminal rate and predominance. Recognizing racial enmity inside racial incongruities is exceedingly troublesome with existing datasets that do exclude such key measures as setting and connection. Then again, ...

Because of this, many states created welfare reforms that focused on drug testing to weed out the individuals who may not be using their welfare for legal practices. There are many states that have ... Obesity is a condition characterized by body mass index above 30. Diabetes on the other hand refers to elevated blood glucose levels above the normal range. The four common bioethical principals applicable to treatment of other health conditions also apply to obesity and diabetes. The principle of beneficence requires care givers to consider benefits of a given treatment and risks involved in decision making. Non-maleficence on the other hand refers to avoidance of harm. The two principles are applied together in treatments. Care delivery to children with diabetes and obesity should observe the two principles. Autonomy is also a bioethical principle. ... There are many reasons which have made up the modern day Haiti. The racial caste systems are what have made the mulattos consider themselves superior to the blacks. The Haitian revolution which occurred in 1791 to 1804 help make the republic to be the first to ever be ruled by black people. The settlement done between the French and Haiti is what started to make the country be in debt with other countries. The occupation of US brought about the formation of good roads, housing and health care. During the earthquake the US were the ones who provided more ... 2206 Rayburn H.O.B.Washington, DC 20515-0918 Dear Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen: In line with the continued upward trend that exhibits rising rates of obesity in children, with a strong link to developing tendencies for preponderance to type 2 diabetes, as a promoter and advocate of good health, I would like to propose that the Bill to combat childhood obesity, as proposed by Congresswoman Marcia L.

As it was announced in the first session of the 113th Congress that the month of September was proposed to be designated as the National ... Racism has been embedded in the American culture for the longest time possible. People of color and those deemed not to show the white people facial features, have been marginalized in the society. Looking back at the history of America where the government enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act. This Act meant that the Chinese had to be put in reserves so as to keep them away from becoming US citizens (Fisher and Shane 2). This act of segregation illustrates how the white race have oppressed other races for over 200 years. This paper will look at how institutional racism ...

Successful public policy is very difficult to devise but when the known facts and the perceptions of the citizens and government officials are used with honesty, success is more likely. David Baum wrote a book about the 'war on drugs' titled Smoke and Mirrors which was published in 1996. Examples from his book have been discussed with reference to Deborah A. Stone's categories of causal stories. Causal stories that are used to justify public policy may involve policy actions that have been carefully researched and are targeted towards a specific goal.

Information systems are a key development measure in our current economy. They were initially developed to enhance better decision-making, planning and monitoring.

This is as a result of the notion that it will influence better decisions which are much more effective. Furthermore information systems are believed to hasten execution of the policies implemented in these departments. Despite the fact that information systems are highly appreciated, there lies a great danger when they are used ... Asimina obovata (Willd.) Nash is also called as the big flower pawpaw.

'Instructor's Name' The verdict on Trayvon Martin case was out coincidentally on the year which marks the 50th anniversary of the civil rights March led by Martin Luther King Jr. Given the range of emotions the verdict attracted, the president decided to give an unscheduled speech, six days after the Florida court acquitted George Zimmerman.

It is a condition associated with increased risk for various chronic disorders, such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. According to data from Broward County, 25.4 percent of adults are obese. The adolescent obesity rate is 9 percent, which is significantly lower than the adult obesity rate, but only 24.7 percent of them engage in some form of physical activity, so they are at risk for developing obesity because of their lifestyle choices. Overall, sedentary lifestyle appears to have a significant role in determining obesity rates in Broward County. Appropriate ... It is correctly pointed out that Alabama is an entirely inappropriate venue for the case between Mr. O'Leary and Ms. Johnson. Alabama is the wrong choice of courts because there is no subject-matter jurisdiction (as the controversy occurred in Florida) and neither is there personal jurisdiction over Ms. Johnson because she is a resident of New Jersey. The analysis regarding federal diversity jurisdiction is largely correct as well. Ms. Johnson should have been prevented from filing a claim in the federal courts for want of an appropriate value of the controversy that she presented. However, the analysis regarding the ... The Bush v. Gore case commenced following the November 2000 elections where George W. Bush was declared the winner.

Despite what some may believe, social stratification is still a prevalent force in today's society. Current events stories are full of tales of minorities, women, and the poor being discriminated against on a regular basis and in very extreme ways. In order to address these issues and become more fully aware of their consequences, it is important to understand current events in the context of racial, gender, and class discrimination.

The Speedy Trial Act has reference to the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution that ensures all criminal defendants the right to speedy and public trial (Campbell and Ohm, 2007, p. 146). In most cases, while there are some defendants who are given trials that they feel are altogether too speedy, the constitutional guarantee really serves 2 purposes. The first purpose is that speedy trial shall relieve the defendant of the pervasive consequences involved with being accused. In the event that the accused is subjected to imprisonment, the length of time that is spent in prison is considered as oppressive ...

The most publicized and sensational violent crimes that have been committed recently, such as the attack on the children of Newtown, Connecticut and the shootings at the Batman movie screening in Aurora, Colorado, have been committed by persons who appear to be mentally ill and perhaps additionally suffering from drug addition. The significant overlap between mental illness, drug addiction, and violence is well documented and thus the criminal justice system has put resources behind trying to solve this problem with programs such as drug and mental health courts (Rossman, 2012).

Skip questions are used in questionnaires seeking responses from respondents who have distinct characteristics. For example, questions skipped by females may be referring to those issues that affect or are relevant to males only. 2. Stratified random sampling method would be most appropriate method. The population is very distinct and it can be grouped into homogenous subgroups. The population can be grouped into respondents with income below $50,000, and those with income above $50000. The researcher can then use different sampling fractions to sample the distinction within the strata of population with income above $50000.This will ensure ... Introduction According to Thomas (2005), the crime rate in 2003 was almost the same as it was in 1973, but the number of people in prisons grew sevenfold. This is a real public policy puzzle because if the number of offenders did not change over the period, it would be appropriate to question the cause of the number of inmates to rise from 300,000 to nearly 2.3 million. The increase media attention in the late 1980s and early 1990s of high profile cases, and law and order demagoguery by politicians all played a part, of course. Nevertheless, the main ...

The university is playing monopoly in provision of the service hence the situation. Analyzing an online survey I conducted recently, more than 80 percent of the students surveyed of ERAU live outside the campus ... The search for the truth is pursuit that has occupied people for as long as humankind has existed; some look for it in science or medicine, some try to find it in art or literature, and others seek it in philosophy or religion. The satisfaction a doctor feels when diagnosing and successfully treating a patient, the pride of an artist creating an excellent portrait, and the joy of the faithful when they feel God has answered a prayer are similar feelings. These people feel that the truth has led to a positive outcome for themselves and others. However, the truth is not always ...

Welfare program is aimed at helping that sector of the society that earns nothing or less than the minimum limit specified by the state government.

Until recent times, according to \"Moving from Pedagogy to Andragogy\" (n.d.), it was also used to describe the teaching of adults, but that is nowadays known as andragogy (sometimes spelt androgogy). The reason for this change of terminology, according to the article, is that whereas pedagogy means teacher-directed instruction, whereby those being taught need to learn only what the teacher decides to teach them and are in a fully dependent and submissive role in that environment, which demands obedience from the learners. In contrast, adult learners are ... It is no secret that good teachers are important. However, the meaning of teacher competition has transformed throughout the nation.

Currently, approximately close to 5 million citizens of the United States that represent close to 2 percent of the United States population is denied the right to vote because of felony conviction. Among all democratic nations, the U.S has the most limiting laws in this font amongst all major democracies in the world. Democratic nations such as New Zealand, Denmark Israel, South Africa, Finland among others give right of voting to felons upon completion of the sentence. In my view, denying the vote to ex-offenders is antidemocratic and compromising to the values of freedom and self-determination. Upon completing their ...

The United States could not have won its independence without the assistance of France and Spain, particularly because their combined naval power was always a threat to Britain's trade and colonies around the world. After its defeat in the land phase of the war in North America, the fighting continued for the next two years, and the U.S. peace negotiators used the opportunity presented by Britain's war weariness and desire to retain as much of its overseas empire as possible to extract highly favorable trade and territorial concessions. Although Gen. Cornwallis had surrendered at Yorktown, the British army ... Studies have verified racial and ethnic disparities in health among low-income children. From birth until they reach adulthood, African American and Hispanic children fare far worse than white children on many sociodemographic and health system measures.

Table 1 summarizes a representative sample of health discrepancies across a wide spectrum of ... In 1939, the film \"Gone with the Wind\" was released and became one of the top-grossing films of all times. The producers did not only try their best to satisfy the white Southerners and the Black slaves, but challenged the public point of view on gender roles, which were relatively unchanged since the Civil War. This duality of intentions made the film both interesting and controversial in its nature. The rhetorical question in the article by Naomi Wolf \"A generation on, do women feel free?\" is of particular for this paper (Wolf 487). This question might be a mystery for ...

The industry of food and food processing are two of the most influential factors that could be considered whenever the topic about health and nutrition are being discussed.
