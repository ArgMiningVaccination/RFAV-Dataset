Maxwell our 11 yr old Boston Terrier is being treated by Dr Odette for a Degenerative Disc Disease. He had his first adjustment the second week of October, at that time he could barely walk as the nerves controlling his hindquarters were being compromised. At this time I'm so happy to say Maxwell is getting around so much better. I don't know what we would have done without Dr Odette's expertise and compassion. Thank you for being our Angel with your healing hands!... I started going here many years ago when a coworker on a new job recommended Dr. Odette. Couldn't be happier with the service I have received over the years, very knowledgeable and friendly staff. Dr. Dan is very patient listening to my ramblings when I see him and taking time with making sure I feel that he got all the adjustments needed in the visit. Thank you all.... I drove all the way from Westland to Trenton for adjustments, so that should say it all. I couldn't stand on my feet when I went to Odette Chiropractic to Dr. Pat. She told me she would have me walking in 6 weeks, and she did. She is wonderful. She also took care of my Mom. I would go back to her. Blessings Pat.... Took my daughter here today for her back! Amazing! Very friendly staff from when we walked in till we left! Thank you again! I am sure my daughter will be a full time patient. She feels so much better then when she walked in.
