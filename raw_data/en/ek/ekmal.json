We all go through some psychological problems of brain fog, depression, anxiety, tantrums, anger, etc., but we should not let it become a part of our daily routine. Emotional detox is the release of negative emotions and thoughts. If you have psychological issues, you likely have some sort of gut issue and vice-versa. Unfortunately, the brain and the gut are intimately linked. You must have heard or even used, 'This is my 'gut feeling'. Gut feeling is our body's primal response to subconscious information. Most of us have experienced the sense of knowing things before we know them without any obvious explanation. The ultimate purpose of gut instinct is to protect us. It's important to heal the fatigue, gut and digestive symptoms; constipation, diarrhea, bloating, gas, etc., simply by managing eating habits, exercising, and healthy life style. Together with these important actions, practice yoga and meditation regularly, make a gratitude journal, spend time outside in nature, indulge in activities to deal with negative emotions, avoid depressive situations, and try to stay calm. Toxic emotions which stem from negative beliefs and attitudinal patterns, need to be purged. Sometimes these waves of emotional detox intertwine with one another, that leave us feeling physically drained and exhausted. Emotional detox is hard, but it is important to continue healing our body. In today's fast paced, electronic, toxin filled world, it's safe to say that many of us are not grounded or only partially grounded. Grounding and being grounded is a term in aromatherapy used to mean connecting with the present, being in the now and physically, spiritually, mentally, emotionally and energetically rooted like a tree (The tree stands firmly rooted to the ground, reaches for sun energy, bears flowers-fruits, sways, and changes with the season). Being grounded can also mean having a clear vision of ourselves and keeping our reactive, ego-centric behaviors in check. Essential oils have been the most amazing natural remedy to help mitigate these toxic emotions and begin healing our mental health. Essential oils for grounding obtained from the barks, roots, needles and resin of aromatic plants, eg: Vetiver, Sandalwood, Cedarwood, Frankincense, Myrrh, Patchouli, Root, Roman Chamomile, Ylang ylang, Rosewood Inhaling the scent of certain oils can help to ground and stabilize the energies being detoxed from our emotional body. Essential oil can be inhaled directly from the bottle or place a single drop in palm, rub hands together, cup around nose, and begin breathing deeply for a calming effect, or apply a drop on wrists and neck, or apply to the bottom of the feet, or diffuse, or can wear like perfume. Grounding-Calming Blend: 5 drops Sandalwood Essential Oil 5 drops Cedarwood Essential Oil 5 drops Lavender Essential Oil 5 drops Bergamot Essential Oil 2 drops Vetiver Essential Oil 2 oz Grapeseed or Almond carrier oil Combine Essential oils and Carrier oil into a 2 oz. dark glass dropper bottle, label, and mix well. Massage 3-5drops near tail bone and lower back daily at night before bed time to open up root chakra, which is a powerful tool to get grounded.
