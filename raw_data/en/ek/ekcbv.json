It is not intended to provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment, or legal advice. In the event of any conflict between this guidance document and any orders or directives issued by the Minister o f Health or the Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH), the order or directive prevails.

The MOH has developed this document with contributions from Public Health Ontario (PHO) based on currentl y available scientific evidence and expert opinion. This document is subject to change as the situation with COVID- 19 continues to evolve. This document is intended to provide broad guidelines only and cannot cover every scenario that may be encountered; therefore, local public health unit (PHU) decision -making is required. Nothing in this document is intended to restrict or affect the discretion of local medical officers of health to exercise their statutory powers under the Health Protection and Promotion Act . Guidance provided by the MOH and other relevant Ministries or organizations may provide additional information about outbreaks and preventative measures in different settings (e.g., acute care, long -term care homes/retirement homes, congregate living settings , COVID -19 Provincial Tes ting Guidance ). Surveillance reporting on variants of concern (VOCs) in Ontario, prevention and management of COVID- 19, as well as information on testing, laboratory results , and their interpretation can be found on the Public Health Ontario webpage . 5 | Page 2 COVID -19 Symptoms The symptoms, signs, and clinical features m ost commonly associated with COVID- 19 are summarized by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The common symptoms of COVID -19 may change as new variants and sub -variants /lineages emerge. Some sy mptoms such as runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and headache may also be features of other non -COVID -19 respiratory infections. T o prevent community transmission of all infectious diseases, all individuals with new symptom (s) of any infectious illness should stay home when they are feeling sick . Ind ividuals experiencing s ymptoms listed below may have COVID -19 and should seek assessment from a health care provider if required and/ or immediately seek testing and assessment if eligible for COVID -19 treatmen t. Individuals with severe symptoms requiring emergency care should go to their nearest emergency department. When assessing for the symptoms below , the focus should b e on evaluating if they are new, worsening, or different from an individual's baseline health status (usual state). Symptoms should not be chronic or related to other known causes or conditions (see examples below). One or more of the following most commo n symptoms of COVID-19 is an indication for COVID -19 testing for those eligible for treatment: Fever and/or chills Cough o Not related to other known causes or conditions (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Shortness of breath o Not related to other known causes or conditions (e.g., chronic heart failure, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Decrease or loss of smell or taste o Not related to other known causes or conditions (e.g., nasal polyps, allergies, neurological disorders) Two or more of the following symptoms of COVID -19 is an indication for COVID - 19 testing for those eligible for treatment: 6 | Page Extre me fatigue (general feeling of being unwell, lack of energy, extreme tiredness) o Not related to other known causes or conditions (e.g., depression, insomnia, thyroid dysfunction, anemia, malignancy, receiving a COVID- 19 or flu vaccine in the past 48 hours) Muscle aches or joint pain o Not related to other known causes or conditions (e.g., osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, receiving a COVID -19 or flu vaccine in the past 48 hours) Gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e., nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea) o Not related to other known causes or conditions (e.g. , transient vomiting due to anxiety in children, chronic vestibular dysfunction, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, side effect of medication) Sore throat (painful swallowing or difficulty swallowing) o Not related to other known causes or conditions (e.g., post- nasal drip, gastroesophageal reflux) Runny nose or nasal congestion o Not related to other known causes or conditions (e.g., returning ins ide from the cold, chronic sinusitis unchanged from baseline, seasonal allergies) Headache o Not related to other known causes or conditions (e.g., tension -type headaches, chronic migraines, receiving a COVID -19 or flu vaccine in the last 48 hours) Other symptoms that may be associated with COVID -19 include: Abdominal pain o Not related to other known causes or conditions (e.g., menstrual cramps, gastroesophageal reflux disease) Conjunctivitis (pink eye) o Not related to other known causes or conditions (e.g., blepharitis, recurrent styes) Decreased or lack of appetite 7 | Page o For young children and not related to other known causes or conditions (e.g., anxiety, constipation) 3 Highest Risk Settings 3.1 Highest Risk settings include: Acute care settings s uch as hospitals , including complex continuing care facilities C ongregate living settings w ith medically and socially vulnerable individuals, including but not limited to long -term care homes, retirement homes, First Nation elder care lodges, group homes, shelters, hospices, correctional institutions, and hospital schools E mployer -provided living settings of International Agricultural Workers PHUs are expected to identify cases associated with highest risk settings for outbreak management support. Cases should primarily be identified to the PHU by the highest risk setting when they have a suspect outbreak . PHUs may also use other means to ident ify cases associated with highest risk settings (e.g., regular communications with highest risk settings, Virtual Assistant, phone call s) to support early outbreak identification . At the discretion of the PHU, more extensive case management, such as commu nication of isolation requirements or sharing of local supports , may be provided to vulnerable individuals in their region (e.g., individuals who are homeless/underhoused) to support their isolation . 3.2 First Nations, Inuit , and Metis Communities PHUs should make specific considerations for case and contact management for First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis communities, in dialogue with the communities and/or Indigenous health service providers, and with respect of the principle of self - determination, to support ongoing surveillance and response that allows for Individuals with any of the above symptoms are recommended to self -isolate and stay at home until fever is resolved and their symptoms have been improving for at least 24 hours (48 hours for gastrointestinal symptoms). Longer self -isolation is recommended in certain populations; see Table 1 for more information. 8 | Page differences in community needs, recognizes differential impacts to communities, and changing needs over time. 3.3 Data Entry Requirements PHUs are expected to complete case s urveillance requirements by follow ing data entry requirements for individual cases associated with outbreaks in highest risk settings. For a description of the data entry requirements for case reporting, see section 5.1 of this document as well as PHO's data entry guidance . 3.4 Outbreak Investigation and Management The aforementioned highest risk settings should notify their local PHU when they have a suspect or confirmed outbreak, as defined by relevant MOH guidance for their sector. Highest risk settings that are institutions or public hospitals must report suspect and confirmed outbreaks to their local PHU as per the Health Protection and Promotion Act. PHUs are expected to investigate and manage suspect and confirmed outbreaks of COVID -19 in highest risk settings as defined above. PHUs should work with local highest risk settings to ensure communication pathways are in place so that suspected outbreaks can be rep orted directly to the PHU as soon as possible, including after -hours . As a safeguard for highest risk settings that do not yet have strong or established connections for engaging with the local PHU, PHUs may also use other means to identify cases associated with highest risk settings (e.g., regular communications with highest risk settings, Virtual Assistant, phone calls) to support early outbreak identification. When suspect outbreaks in highest risk settings are reported directly to the PHU by the highest risk setting, initial investigation steps (e.g. , assignment of an outbreak number, initial recommendations) should be taken in a timely manner (e.g., same day if possible) , with additional outbreak management follow -up on the next business day . For institutions with a duty to report as per the Health Protection and Promotion Act but that are not a highest risk setting as listed above, there are no expectations that COVID -19 respiratory outbreaks be entered in the provincial Case and Contact Management (CCM) system. 9 | Page For all institutions and public hospitals, if there is strong evidence of a non -COVID -19 aetiology for a respiratory outbreak, the outbreak should still be managed as per usual by the PHU and in accordance with the Ontario Public Health Standards. PHUs are still expected to investigate and manage reports of gastrointestinal outbreaks in institutions as per usual. 4 Public Health Advice for Symptomatic and COVID -19 Positive Individuals 4.1 Testing Recommendations Accessing laboratory -based or rapid molecular testing: Individuals with COVID -19 symptoms ma y seek molecular testing (laboratory - based or rapid) if eligible. See the COVID -1 9 Provincial Testing Guidance f or information on eligibility. o W here there is a high index of suspicion that an individ ual may be a COVID -19 case with a possible false -negative laboratory -based or rapid molecular test result, re -testing is advised if relevant to clinical management, and initiation of case isolation/ outbreak management may be appropriate based on the PHU 's risk assessment for those in high- risk settings. Use of rapid antigen tests: Individuals with COVID -19 symptoms who use rapi d antigen tests should be aware that they may produce false negative resul ts, particularly early in COVID - 19 infection. Repeat testing at least 24 hours after an initial negative test improves confidence in a negative test result. See the COVID -1 9 Provincial Testing Guidance for information about rapid antigen tests . o Individuals who may be eligible for treatment a nd have an initial negative rapid antigen test result are strongly recommended to seek laboratory - based or rapid molecular testing as soon as possible given the time frame for receiving therapeutics . At this time, a positive rapid antigen test result is sufficient to initiate COVID -19 treatment, for those who are eligible, and does not need to be confirmed. 10 | Page Testing for clearance is not recommended : There is no provincial public health requirement for workers who are test - positive cases or isolated due to COVID- 19 symptoms to provide proof of a negative test result or a positive serological test result to their employers in order to return to work. It is expected that workers who have tested positive or who have symptoms of COVID -19 follow public health isolation recommendations as outlined in T able 1 below , as well as occupational health recommendations where applicable, for when they would be considered clear ed to return to work. 4.2 Isolation Guidelines for Individuals with COVID- 19 Symptoms and/or with a Positive COVID -19 Test Self-isolation means: o The case is to stay home and not attend work, school, child care , or other public places. o The case should o nly leave home if there is a medical emergency or if they need to get a clinical assessment or test. See the COVID -19 Clinical Assessments and Testing page for more information. o If the case must leave the home, they should travel in a private vehicle if possible. If this is not possible, the case should wear a medical mask , keep distance from others in the vehicle (e.g. , sit in the backseat) , and if possible and weather permitting, open the window s to increase air exchange in the vehicle. o At home, the case should stay in a separate room away from other people in the home and use a separate bathroom as much as possible. If in the same room, they should wear a well- fitting mask (medical mask if available) for source control and improve ventilation (e.g. , windows should be open if possible). Household members should also wear a mask when in the same room if possible. Household caregivers should refer to PHO's fact sheet on Guide for caregivers, family members and close contacts . Anyone who is at higher risk of severe complications from COVID -19 (e. g., immunocompromised and/or elderly) should avoid caring for or coming in close contact with a case. 11 | Page o The case may leave their home for independent outdoor exercise (or with a caregiver, as appropriate) , but should maintain physical distance of at least 2 metres (6 feet) from others at all times. The case should not go to outdoor fitness classes or personal training sessions and should wear a mask in building common areas when leaving the property if self -isolating in an apartment, condo, or hotel . The dur ation of self -isolation after the date of specimen collection or symptom onset (whichever is earlier/applicable) depends on relevant clinical factors such as setting, severity of infection, and immune status (see Table 1 ). 4.3 Isolation Guidelines for Individuals with COVID- 19 Symptoms Following Antiviral Treatment There have been reports of \"COVID -19 rebound\" in some individuals who have received Paxlovid for their COVID -19 illness. This refers to recurrence of COVID - 19 symptoms in individuals 2 -8 days following completion of treatment. o Given the limited evidence on this phenomenon thus far, it is recommended that these individuals be re -isolated using the date of rebound symptom onset. This is a precautionary measure under the presumption that the rebound in symptoms is associated with a rebound in infectiousness. 12 | Page Table 1: Isolation Period for Test- Positive Cases and Individuals with COVID -19 symptoms Population Isolation Period Additional Precautions after Self - Isolation Period Individuals with severe illness1 (requiring ICU level of care) At least 20 days (or at discretion of hospital IPAC) after the date of specimen collection or symptom onset (whichever is earlier/applicable) and until symptoms have been improving for 24 hours (or 48 hours if gastrointestinal symptoms) and no fever present. N/A 1 Severe illness is defined as requiring ICU level of care for COVID -19 illness (e.g., respiratory dysfunction, hypoxia, shock and/or multi -system organ dysfunction). 13 | Page Population Isolation Period Additional Precautions after Self - Isolation Period Individuals who : residing in a highest risk setting2 hospitalized for COVID -19 related illness ( not requiring ICU level of care ) immun ocompromise d3 At least 10 days after the date of specimen collection or symptom onset (whichever is earlier/ applicable) and until symptoms have been improving for 24 hours (or 48 hours if gastrointestinal symptoms) and no fever present. Duration of isolation may be modified based on hospital IPAC direction (for inpatients) or health care provider direction (for individuals with immun e compromise) . Setting -specific guidance prevails for case isolation in highest risk settings. N/A 2 Isolation is recommended from others to prevent transmission within the highest risk setting. However, i ndividuals may follow routine guidance on isolation duration when they are in the community. 3 Examples of immune compromise include cancer chemotherapy, untreated HIV infection with CD4 T lymphocyte count <200, combined primary immunodeficiency disorder, taking prednisone >20 mg/day (or equivalent) for more than 14 days , and taking other immune suppressive medications. Factors such as advanced age, diabetes, and end -stage renal disease are generally not considered severe immune compromise impacting non -test based clearance. 14 | Page Population Isolation Period Additional Precautions after Self - Isolation Period All other individuals not listed above who have COVID -19 symptoms OR a positive COVID -19 test (PCR, rapid molecular or rapid antigen test) Until sy mptoms have been improving for 24 hours (or 48 hours if gastrointestinal symptoms) and no fever present. Asymptomatic individuals with a positive test result do not need to self - isolate unless symptoms develop. If symptoms develop, they should self - isolate immediately For a total of 10 days after the date of specimen collection or symptom onset (whichever is earlier/applicable), individuals should: o Continue to wear a well -fitted mask in all public settings (including schools and childcare, unless under 2 years old) and avoid non -essential a ctivities where mask removal is necessary (e.g., dining out, playing a wind instrument, high contact sports where masks cannot be safely worn ) 4 o Not visit anyone who is immunocompromised or at higher risk of illness (e.g., seniors) o Avoid non- essential visits to highest risk settings such as hospitals and long -term care homes 15 | Page 5 Case and Outbreak Management PHUs are not expected to conduct individual level case follow -up for case management purposes , only for surveillance and outbreak identification in highest risk settings (see section 3 ). Case management is at the discretion of the PHU and may be conducted as needed for certain cases in highest risk settings or other vulnerable populations ( e.g., to support isolation) . PHUs should make specific considerations for case and contact management for F irst Nations , Inuit , and M \u00e9tis communities , in dialogue with the communities and/or Indigenous health service providers, and with respect of the principle of self - determination, to support ongoing surveillance and response that allows for differences in community needs, recognizes differential impacts to communities, and changing needs over time. If case and contact management is initiated, the PHU may determine their frequency of communications based on a risk assessment and available staffing resources. 5.1 Case Reporting For data that is not populated directly into the CCM system via the Ontario Laboratory Information System (OLIS) such as receipt of manual faxes , PHUs must enter the minimum set of data elements to create the case in CCM as indicated in the most recent Enhanced Surveillance Directive for each confirmed case (and probable cases where feasible). Data should also be entered in accordance with PHO data entry guidance. PHUs must continue to make an effort to acquire (e.g. , using ConnectingOntario), receive (e.g. , information sent directly from hospitals) , and enter hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and deaths into CCM for the purpose of COVID- 19 surveillance. If received, PHUs may enter other case information (e.g., underlying medical condition, symptoms). In the event of a future VOC , there may be additional time limited requirements for additional data entry into CCM in order to gather pertinent initial surveillance on the emerging VOC, as directed by the MOH . 16 | Page 5.2 Considerations for Case s and Outbreak Management in Highest Risk Settings Relevant sector -specific guidance for highest risk settings ( see Section 3 ) should be followed for those specific settings where conflicting with the below information. Ce rtain groups, such as home and community care staff and residents or paramedic service workers , are considered highest risk groups for the purposes of molecular testing eligibility and guidance on return to work in this document (see below and Appendix A ). However, they are not considered part of highest risk settings for t he purpose of outbreak management (e.g., an ambulance service headquarters is not a highest risk setting). Highest risk settings should notify their local PHU of individuals who test positive on a rapid antigen test and did not receive confirmatory molecular testing if they are associated with a suspect or confirmed outbreak in the setting. Cl ose contacts in highest risk settings that develop symptoms should be managed as probable cases for outbreak management purposes. PHUs should follow PHO data entry guidance and not enter these contacts as probable cases if test results are pending. At the dis cretion of the PHU, case management of vulnerable individuals or as part of outbreaks in highest risk settings may be conducted to support those individuals. This may include: R egular (e.g., daily) calls to cases in highest risk settings and other vulnera ble individuals who may have challenges following public health guidance . Use of clinical assessment centres; Use of isolation facilities , if applicable ; Use of community supports and agencies ; Psychosocial supports; Courier, delivery supports for food and necessities; Emergency financial support s through the provincial government and local regions ; Provincial job -pr otected infectious disease emergency leave and federal government financial supports i ncluding employment insurance ; and /or 17 | Page Additional resources available to support isolation for marginalized populations through the High Priority Communities strategy . Individuals who reside in highest risk settings Please refer to setting -specific documents for guidance on case isolation in highest risk settings (see section 3 ). Individuals who work in highest risk settings If the case works in a highest risk setting , they should speak with their employer and follow their workplace guidance for return to work. For routine oper ations (i.e., in the absence of staff shortages) , COVID -19 positive cases that work in highest risk settings may return to work: o 10 days after symptom onset or date of specimen collection (whichever is earlier) ; AND o Provided they have no fever and other symptoms have been improving for 24 hours (or 48 hours if gastrointestinal symptoms ). Testing for clearance is not recommended. See Appendix A for Staffing Options for Highest Risk Settings experiencing critical staffing shortages . 5.3 Detected ( Low Level) PCR Target Gene Results and Indeterminate Results Some laboratories have added the qualifier \"detected (low level)\" to positive PCR results where the cycle threshold (Ct) value is high (meaning the viral load level is low , e.g. , a Ct value between 35 and 37 ). This result is still a POSITIVE result and should be interpreted in the clinical and epidemiological context of the case. It may represent an early stage of infection, a late stage of infection (e.g. , residual non- infectious gene fragments), or a false positive result. This \"detected (low level)\" result is distinct from \"indeterminate\" results where the result cannot be differentiated between the presence or absence of the target gene. Individuals with a \"detected (low level)\" target gene result should still be managed as a case. However, if the pre -test probability of COVID- 19 is low (e.g., asymptomatic screen testing ) and there are no other target genes reported as detected on the PCR assay report at the time , then repeat molecular testing may be warrante d as for any other situations where there is a concern for a false positive result. Follow up for indeterminate cases is at the discretion of the PHU. 18 | Page 5.4 Management of Previously Cleared Cases with New Positive Results If molecular samples from the previously cleared infection and molecular samples from the new positive result are available and of sufficient viral load to permit additional investigations ( Ct value <30), VOC screening and/or whole genome sequencing may be requested to provide further laboratory evidence supporting a reinfection with a different SARS -CoV -2 variant as opposed to persistent positivity with the same SARS -CoV -2 variant (see Case Definition - Coronavirus Disease [COVID -19] Section C. Laboratory -Based Case of Reinfection) . Persistent positive : If there is evidence that the new positive result is likely to be due to ongoing persistent detection from the previous ly cleared infection (e.g., incidental positive collected within 90 days of prior positive in an asymptomatic individual) , then no further public health case management is required. Re-infection: o Case manage ment Evidence suggests reinfections can occur less than 9 0 days after a previous confirmed infection. Cases where re -infection is suspected (e.g., new onset of COVID -19 symptoms after prior infection) should be managed as currently infectious, regardless of whether they meet case definition as a re -infection case . T his includes rebound of symptoms post treatment. o Data Entry Re infections that meet either the lab-based or time -based Ontario Case of Reinfection Definitions should be entered as confirmed cases into CCM . Suspected reinfections that DO NOT meet either the lab- ba sed or time -based Ontario Case of Reinfection Definition s sh ould follow PHO Data Ent ry Guidance for entry of new positive result in a previously cleared individual. PHO is available for consultation on re-i nfection cases (whether confirmed or suspected) via epir@oahpp.ca . 19 | Page 6 Guidelines for Close Contacts 6.1 Definition of Close Contacts A close contact is defined as an individual who has a high- risk exposure (see Table 2) to a confirmed positive COVID -19 case , an individual with COVID -19 symptoms, or an individual with a positive rapid antigen test result. In general, this refers to individuals who have had a high- risk exposure (see Table 2 ) with the case (or symptomatic person ): o During the case's infectious period - i .e., within the 48 hours prior to the case's symptom onset if symptomatic or 48 hours prior to the specimen collection date (whichever is earlier/applicable) and until the case has completed their self -isolation period ; AND o Were in close proximity (less than 2 meters) for at least 15 minutes or for multiple short periods of time without measures such as masking, distancing , and/or use of personal protective equipment depending on the nature of contact. For acute care settings, it is the responsibility of the acute care setting to identify and notify close contacts of cases within the setting. It is up to the discretion of the acute care setting and/or PHU to notify close contacts who are no longer admitted in the acute care setting. For other highest risk settings, identification and notification of close contacts of cases in the setting is the responsibility of the PHU in collaboration with the setting. It is up to the discretion of the PHU to notify close contacts who are no longer residing in the highest risk setting. In the community, it is the responsibility of the individual with COVID -19 symptoms or COVID- 19 positive test to determine who their close contacts are and to notify them of their potential exposure. Employers must also follow requirements as per the Occupational Health and Safety Act. Note: The public health guidance within this document is intended for close contacts with high -risk exposures as per Table 2 . Contacts with other exposures that would not be considered high risk exposures as per this guidance may still be at some risk of infect ion. For further details see: Focus On: Risk Assessment Approach for COVID -19 Contact Tracing . 20 | Page Table 2 : Examples of High -Risk Exposures Exposure Setting E xamples of High -risk exposures Household (includes other congregate settings) Anyone living in the same household during the infectious period . o This may include members of an extended family, roommates, boarders, etc. o This may include people who provided care for the case (e.g., bathing, toileting, dressing, feeding etc.) o This may include individuals who spent substantial time in the home with the case (e.g., care givers, guests) o This excludes individuals who live in a completely separate area/unit (e.g., self -contained basement apartment) 21 | Page Exposure Setting Examples of High -risk exposures Community (includes workplaces, schools, childcare, camps) Had direct contact with infectious body fluids of the case (e.g., coughed on or sneezed on) Were in close proximity (less than 2 meters) 5 for at least 15 minutes 6 or for multiple short periods of time without consistent and appropriate use of masking 7 5 Close Contact: Maintenance of physical distancing measures (> 2 metres) for the entire duration of exposure decreases the risk of transmission. However, physical distancing of 2 metres does not eliminate the risk of transmission, particularly in confined indoor and poorly ventilated spaces and during exercise, talking loudly, yelling, or singing activities. 6 Prolonged Contact: Prolonged exposure duration may be defined as lasting cumulatively more than 15 minutes ; however, individuals with exposures of <1 5 minutes may still be considered close contacts depending on the context of the contact/exposure. As part of the individual risk assessment, consider the cumulative duration and nature of the contact's exposure (e.g., a longer exposure time/cumulative time of exposures likely increases the risk, an outdoor only exposure likely decreases the risk, whereas exposure in a small, closed, or poorly ventilated space may increase the risk even if individuals are distanced or masked), the case's symptoms (e.g., cou ghing or severe illness likely increases exposure risk), physical interaction (e.g., hugging, kissing), and whether PPE by the contact or source control by the case was used. 7 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) : If PPE is worn consistently and in accordance with organizational recommendations for the nature of the interaction and for the entire duration of exposure, the individual would generally not be considered a close contact; however, it is important to assess the context of the interactions with th e case and other factors that may increase risk of exposure (e.g., physical touching, prolonged duration, confined space with poor ventilation). Note: Workers should follow organizational policies on the use of PPE for patients with suspected and confirmed COVID -19. 22 | Page Exposure Setting Examples of High -risk exposures Health care and other highest risk settings (including long term care homes, retirement homes, First Nation Elder Care Lodges, group homes, shelters, hospices, correctional institutions, hospital schools) See the relevant sector specific guidance documents for m ore information. Patient/resident is the case: Health care worker and/or staff who provided direct care for the case, or who had other similar close physical contact (i.e., less than 2 met res from patient for more than transient duration of time) without consistent use of PPE for the setting and interaction 8 Health care workers and/or staff who had direct contact with infectious body fluids of the case . Other patients/residents in the same semi - private/ward room Other patients/residents who had close 5, prolonged 6 contact with the patient case without consis tent masking 7-8 Health care worker/staff is the case: All patients/residents who had close 5, prolonged 6 contact to the health care worker/staff Note: Patients exposed to the health care worker/staff where contact was neither close nor prolonged, AND the health care worker/staff was masked for the entire duration would generally not be considered high risk exposures. Consideration may also be given if the patient was consistently masked during the int eraction. 7 All co -workers who had unprotected close and/or prolonged contact with the case (e.g., within 2 metres in an enclosed common area) 5-8 Close contacts as identified by workplace occupational health & safety or hospital IPAC (as appropriate) 23 | Page 6.2 Close Contacts Outside of Highest Risk Settings Household and Non -Household Close Co ntacts For a total of 10 days after the last exposure to the COVID- 19 positive case or individual with COVID -19 symptoms, the individual notified by a case should: o Self-monitor for symptoms. They should self -isolate immediately i f they develop any symptom of COVID -19; o Wear a well fitted mask in all public settings : Individuals should maintain masking as much as possible in public settings (including school and child care, unless under 2 years old). Reasonable exceptions would include removal for essential activities like eating, while maintaining as much distancing as possible; Participation in activities where masking can be maintained throughout may be resumed, but individuals should avoid activities where mask removal would be necessary (e.g. , dining out; playing a wind instrument; high contact sports where masks cannot be safely worn); and Individuals who are unable to mask (e.g., children under two years of age, etc.) may return to public settings without masking . o Avoid non- essential visits to anyone who is immunocompromised or at higher risk of illness (e.g., seniors) ; and o Avoid non- essential visits to highest risk settings such as hospitals and long -term care homes. Where essential visit cannot be avoided, close contacts should wear a medical mask , maintain physical distancing, and notify the highest risk setting of their recent exposure . 8 For the purposes of public health follow -up and guidance for close contacts with high- risk exposures, where there has been exposure to an individual who was not previously identified as a suspect or confirmed COVID -19 case, if the exposed worker had consistent medical masking (without the use of eye protection, gowns, and/or gloves) , this would generally not be considered a high -risk exposure. Note: Workers should follow organizational policies on the use of PPE for patients with suspected and confirmed COVID -19. 24 | Page 6.3 Close Contacts in Highest Risk Settings Those who live in the setting: Close contacts who live in a highest risk setting may need to isolate following a high -risk exposure, based on the sector -specific isolation guidance ( see Section 3), direction from local PHU, or d irection from the local hospital IPAC team for hospitalized patients. Tho se who work in the setting: Employees working in highest risk settings who have had a high- risk exposure (see Table 2 ) to a COVID -19 case should speak with their employer to report their exposure and follow their workplace guidance for return to work. Employees working in highest risk settings should self -monitor for symptoms for a total of 10 days after the last exposure to the COVID- 19 positive case or individual with COVID -19 symptoms. All employees should self -isolate immediately if they develop any symptom of COVID -19. Individuals who are required to work in person may attend the highest risk setting right away following the guidance below. Close contacts should self-monitor for 10 days from last exposure 9. Close contacts who develop any symptom(s) of COVID -19 should self -isolate immediately . Where feasible, a dditional workplace measures for individuals who are self - monitoring for 10 days from last exposure may include: o Recommending that close contacts with a household (ongoing) exposure obtain an immediate PCR or rapid molecular test, and re -testing at day 5 from initial exposure if in itial test was negative. 9 \"Last exposure\" refers to the last day the contact was exposed to an individual with COVID - 19 symptoms or a positive test result . Individuals w ho have ongoing exposure to a case (i.e., case is unable to effectively self -isolate ) would have their last exposure on the date the case ended the ir self -isolation period. For example, if a parent was caring for a child with COVID - 19 and the child was to be self- isolating from Monday to Saturday, the 'last exposure' for the parent would be Saturday. 25 | Page o Recommending that close contacts with a discrete (one -time) high -risk exposure obtain PCR or rapid molecular testing at day 5 from initial exposure. o Testing of close contacts with rapid antigen testing for 10 days may be recommend ed (as an alternative to PCR/molecular testing and/or in addition to PCR/molecular testing) based on setting specific IPAC and/or Occupational Health direction. o Where testing is recommended, individuals may continue to attend the highest risk setting even if test results are pending or if testing was not obtained, unless otherwise directed by their IPAC/Occupational health lead. o Active screening for symptoms ahead of each shift . o Individuals should not remove their mask when in the presence of other staff to reduce exposure to co- workers (i.e. , not eating meals/drinking in a shared space such as conference room or lunch room ). o Working in only one facility, where possible . o Ensuring well -fitting source control masking for the staff to reduce the risk of transmission (e.g. , a well -fitting medical mask or fit or non -fit tested N95 respirator or KN95). 7 Risk of COVID -19 Spread Between People and Animals There have been infrequent confirmed reports of the SARS -CoV -2 virus spreading from animal s to individuals (e.g., in mink farms) . Based on available information to date, animal -to-human transmission is likely very uncommon and the risk to most people in Canada for acquiring COVID -19 from animals appears to be very lo w. See the Government of Canada's website f or more information on the risk of COVID -19 spreading from animals to people, for information on how to keep your pets safe when you have COVID -19 or COVID -19 symptoms and guidelines for individuals who have had contact with farm animals or wild life . 26 | Page 8 Travel lers from O utside of Canada PHU follow -up for international fli ghts where travellers are under federal quarantine is not required unless the traveller tests positive for COVID -19 during their quarantine period and the case information is forwarded to the PHU. See the Government of Canada's website fo r testing and quarantine requirements and exemptions for travellers within and outside of Canada. The Government of Canada's website al so provides quarantine requirements for travellers who have an exposure or test positive during the federal quarantine period . All individuals permitted to enter Canada should follow the Federal Emergency Orders and public health and workplace r ules, self -monitor for symptoms , and immediately self -isolate should symptoms develop. Compliance with the orders is managed by the PHAC w ith support from other agencies, including the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), local police, the Ontario Provincial Police ( OPP) , and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). In addition, in some re gions private security have been contracted to assist with in- person follow -up. Local PHUs do not have a direct role in enforcement of the Quarantine Orders but are able to provide support and information (e.g., requirements of self -isolation) and, if required, refer cases to the local police . PHUs may also contact the Compliance and Enforcement office at PHAC ( phac.isolation - isolement.aspc@canada.ca) to request a quarantine breach assessment. Should an individual require essential health care during the 14 -day quarantine period , these individuals may seek service but should be managed as an individual in isolation. Where possible, trave llers should receive healthcare remotely through services such as Health Connect Ontario ( formerly Telehealth Ontario ). 27 9 Appendix A: Management of Staffing in Highest Risk Settings It is the responsibility of the organization implementing this guidance to determine what early return to work option to use under their current circumstances and populations served. In the event of conflicting guidance, specific direc tion on which staffing options can be used for early return to work from other relevant ministries (e.g., Ministry of Long -Term Care) should be followed. If staffing shortages are impacting care, routine return to work options listed below should be exhausted prior to progressing to options for critical staff shortages, which have more risk of COVID -19 transmission with in the setting . The use of options with more risk of COVID- 19 transmission should be commensurate to the risk of insufficient staff ing to patients/residents to provide adequate care. 9.1 Routine Operations Staffing Options Asymptomatic Close Contacts with high- risk exposures See Section 6.3 f or guidance on return to work of staff who are close contacts. COVID- 19 Positive Cases For routine operations, COVID -19 positive cases that work in highest -risk settings may return to work if they have no fever and other symptoms have been improving for 24 hours ( or 48 hours if vomiting/diarrhea) AND meet at least one of the following criteria: 1) 10 days after symptom onset or date of specimen collection (whichever is earlier) OR 2) After a single negative molecular test any time prior to 10 days from the date of specimen collection or symptom onset (whichever is earlier) OR 3) After two consecutive negative rapid antigen tests that are collected at least 24 hours apart any time prior to 10 days from the date of specimen collection or symptom onset (whichever is earlier) . NOTE: Testing for clearance is NOT recommended. For settings that are using testing to support return to work, staff may routinely return to work earlier than day 10 if criteria 2 or 3 are met. 28 9.2 Options For Critical Staffing Shortages COVID- 19 Positive Cases For critical staffing shortages , if routine best practice operation s (see Section 9.1 Routine Operations Staffing Opti ons) cannot be met, COVID -19 positive staff may return to work earlier with adherence to Workplace Measures for Reducing Risk of Exposure (Section 9.3) in place, and making organizational decisions with the following principles for reducing risk of spread: 1) Staff must be afebrile and their symptoms have been improving for 24 hours (48 hours if vomiting/diarrhea). 2) While there is no specific minimum time prior to returning to work, staff who are closer to day 10 from their symptom onset date/specimen collection date should be prioritized for early return to work ahead of staff closer to their symptom onset/specimen collection date (for staff who do not meet test -based criteria in Section 9.1) . 3) Staff who have never had sympt oms should be prioritized ahead of staff who have been symptomatic . 4) Assignment of staff on early r eturn to work should be prioritized to caring for COVID -19 positive/recovered patients/residents, if possible . With appropriate IPAC oversight, staff on ear ly return to work may be assigned to care for all patients /residents (including COVID -19 negative patients /residents), with strict adherence to workplace measures for reducing risk of transmission, and avoiding caring for patients/residents at highest risk of severe COVID -19 infection, where possible. 9.3 Workplace Measures for Reducing Risk of Exposure Ensuring well -fitting source control masking for the staff on early return to work to reduce the risk of transmission (e.g., a well -fitting medical mask or fit or non -fit tested N95 respirator or KN95). o PPE and IPAC practices should be reviewed (including audits) to ensure meticulous attention to measures for staff on early return to work. Providing supports (e.g., separate breakroom) such that individuals on early return to work do not remove their mask in the presence of other staff who are unmasked to reduce the risk of exposing co -workers. 29 | Page Staff cases on early return to work should be prioritized to wor k on a single ward or area of the facility for at least 10 days after date of specimen collection or symptom onset (whichever is earlier) in order to prevent transmission across the setting , as much as possible . Staff should be working only in one facility , as much as possible . 9.4 Administrative Considerations for Selecting Staff for Return to Work Under Critical S taff Shortages The fewest number of staff who are COVID -19 cases should be returned to work early to allow for business continuity and safe operations. 30 | Page 10 Additional Resources Public Health Ontario Public Resources Public Health Agency of Canada's Public Health Management of Cases and Contacts for COVID- 19 Public Health Agency of Canada's COVID -19: For Health Professionals w ebsite Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID -19 website European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's COVID -19 website Ministry of Health's COVID -19 website Provincial Infectious Diseases Advisory Committee's Tools for Preparedness: Triage, Screening and Patient Management of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS -CoV) Infections in Acute Care Settings Government of Canada's COVID- 19 Affected Areas list World Health Organization's Diseas e Outbreak News website , and COVID -1 9 website 31 | Page 11 Document History Revision Date Document Section Description of Revisions January 30 2020 D ocument was created.
