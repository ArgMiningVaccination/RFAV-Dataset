But the emergence of numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants has put the eectiveness of these vaccines, and other intervention measures under threat. So it is important to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 in the presence of its variants of concern (VOC) in controlling the spread of the disease. To address these situations and to nd a way out of this problem, a new mathematical model consisting of a system of non-linear dierential equations considering the original COVID- 19 strain with its two variants of concern (Delta and Omicron) has been proposed and formulated in this paper. We then analyzed the proposed model to study the transmission dynamics of this multi-strain model and to investigate the consequences of the emergence of multiple new SARS- CoV-2 variants which are more transmissible than the previous ones. The control reproduction number, an important threshold parameter, is then calculated using the next-generation matrix method. Further, we presented the discussion about the stability of the model equilibrium. It is shown that the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of the model is locally asymptotic stable when the control reproduction is less than unity. It is also shown that the model has a unique endemic equilibrium (EEP) which is locally asymptotic stable when the control reproduction number is greater than unity. Using the Center Manifold theory it is shown that the model also exhibits the backward bifurcation phenomenon when the control reproduction number is less than unity. Again without considering the re-infection of the recovered individuals, it is proved that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when the reproduction threshold is less than unity. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to verify the analytic results and to show the impact of multiple new SARS-CoV-2 variants in the population which are more contagious than the previous variants. Global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis has been done to identify which parameters have a greater impact on disease dynamics and control disease transmission. Numerical simulation suggests that the emergence of new variants of concern increases COVID-19 infection and related deaths. It also reveals that a combination of non- pharmaceutical interventions with vaccination programs of new more eective vaccines should be continued to control the disease outbreak. This study also suggests that more doses of vaccine should provide to combat new and deadly variants like Delta and Omicron. *Corresponding author.

Introduction The rst reported case of COVID-19 was in December 2019 and since then, it has become a global epidemic [1]. As of February 2023, approximately 6.8 million people have died, and approximately 760 million people have been infected which testies how deadly it is [2]. Before the invention of vaccines, the use of face masks, lock-down, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions and community mitigation strategies (such as: washing and sanitizing hands frequently, and isolation of suspected individuals) were thought to be the eective way to mitigate the disease spread [3,4]. These intervention measures did prove their eectiveness theo- retically and mathematically against the pandemic [5,6]but were sometimes insucient to stop the disease outbreak. So vaccination is thought to be the most eective way to confront this issue and hence vaccinologists worked tirelessly to develop vaccines for preventing COVID-19. At the end of 2020, the rst vaccine was approved by World Health Organization (WHO) [7]a n d it was assumed that vaccination can lead to the end of this pandemic. After that multiple eective vaccines were approved by WHO [7], but the emergence of various new and deadly COVID-19 variants makes it dicult to curtail the disease burden. It is common for the virus to change over time [8]. In most cases, these changes have little or no impact. But as the variants appear with dierent forms of mutations, sometimes these changes may aect the level of infectiousness, the severity of the disease, and the vaccine performance [8]. Variants, those that pose an increased risk to public health and the economy, are specied as Variants of Concern (VOCs) and are called so to promote global monitoring and research [9,10]. This feature of viruses is also visible in the case of COVID-19 and till now we have witnessed many variants of COVID-19. Alpha variant (B.1.1.7), having a 75% higher transmission rate than the wild strain, was one of the variants that were listed for SARS-CoV-2 VOC [11]. Delta variant (B.1.617.2), 60% more transmissible than the alpha variant, was another VOC that was rst identied in December 2020 and became the most common and dominant one by April 2021 [12]. The last variant, which was listed as a VOC and proved its supremacy over all other variants, was the Omicron variant [13]. It is three times more infectious than the Delta variant [14]. So it is a matter of concern for public health workers and general people as it is seen that the mutated ones may vary in the level of infectiousness and response to the existing vaccines [8]. After the approval of the rst vaccine (Pzer/BioNTech) against COVID-19, mass vaccination programs started in the USA [7, 15]. After that many more vaccines have been approved for use against COVID-19 (Moderna, Janssen J & were highly eective against the wild strain but they show varying levels of eectiveness against the new variants like Delta and Omicron [15,16]. Thus the dynamics of COVID-19 in the presence of Delta and Omicron variants will vary signicantly and hence it has become necessary for researchers to study the dynamics of COVID-19 in the presence of Delta and Omicron variants to control the disease spread. In this scenario mathematical model can be used to get insight into the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Mathematical models can also be analyzed numerically to evaluate the consequences of the new SARS-CoV-2 mutants. There are lots of mathematical models to evaluate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 [17,6,18-22,16,23,24]and so on. But there are only a few mathematical models to describe the behavior of the COVID-19 wild strain in the presence of its variants of concern [25-28]. Model in [25] considered multiple strains with optimal control theory and waning of immunity. Again model described in [26], evaluated the impact of a new variant for generating more infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Authors in [27], using a mathematical model, depicted the dynamics of the two strains model under one vaccination regime. They showed the impact of multiple variants and their response to the vaccine and also on developing new infections and deaths. Incorporating vaccination in a two-strain COVID-19 model, authors in [28]s h o w e d that a variant would become dominant if it had a higher reproduction number with respect to the other strain. Motivated by the above-mentioned papers, in this paper we formulated and developed a new mathematical model considering the wild strain and its two other variants, Delta and Omicron, to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. Our goal is to assess the impact of the original strain and its other two variants on developing new infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Our model is novel in the sense we have considered a three-strain model which has not been investigated before. We have also assessed the eect of the Delta variant and Omicron variant using numerical simulation which is also a new feature of this paper. We have included a compartment for the quarantined individuals in our model as it is known that the most eective way to reduce infection is to isolate the infected individuals. Many studies conrm the re-infection of recovered individuals [29,30]and hence we have considered re-infection of recovered individuals. Global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is performed in this paper to detect the top-ranked parameters that control the control reproduction number and hence the dynamics of the model. The entire paper is designed as follows. The formulation of the model is described in section2. Rigorous and qualitative mathemat- ical analysis of the model has been carried out and the control reproduction number has been calculated in section3. Vaccine-derived herd immunity threshold has also been calculated in this section. In section4, numerical results and related discussions are presented. Global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis have also been performed in this section to identify the most influential parameters. Re- sults obtained in theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are summarized in section5. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Model formulation A mathematical model, in the form of a system of non-linear dierential equations, has been developed considering the original strain with its two other variants: Delta and Omicron. It has been considered that the wild strain and the mutants have dierent levels of contagiousness. The compartments: exposed class, pre-symptomatic class, symptomatic class, and asymptomatic class, are Heliyon 9 (2023) e17900 3S.SahaandA.K.Saha Fig. 1.SchematicdiagramoftheCOVID-19model( 5). considered separately for each of the strains. The total human population, (), is divided into the following mutually exclusive compartments (equation (1)): susceptible (), vaccinated individuals (), ()and recovered individuals (), where =1, 2, 3, and so we have ()=()+()+()+()+()+()+()+()+(). (1) Some of the important assumptions in the model formulation are listed below: Assumption-1: Birth rate (natural recruitment) is not considered. Assumption-2: Individuals exposed to COVID-19 are unable to infect others. Assumption-3: Pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals are able to transmit infection. Assumption-4: Recovered individuals may become susceptible again. Assumption-5: Preexisting SARS-CoV-2 variants are less contagious than the new variant. Susceptible individuals acquire infection with the original strain at a rate 1, given by 1=1(1)(11+1+11) , (2) Again, susceptible individuals acquire infection with the Delta variant at a rate 2, given by 2=2(1)(22+2+22) , (3) Similarly, susceptible individuals acquire infection with the Omicron variant at a rate 3, given by 3=3(1)(33+3+33) . (4) Here , =1, 2, 3is the eective contact rate of disease transmission for the original strain, Delta strain, and Omicron strain, respectively. It is assumed that people use face masks at a rate , and represents face mask ecacy. 0 <, <1are modication parameters indicating low infectiousness of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in the andclasses compared to the individuals in the classes, respectively. Graphical representation of the 3-strain COVID-19 model is shown in Fig.1. The model is presented in the form of a system of nonlinear dierential equations (where a dot represents dierentiation with time) as follows: In the model (5), is the recruitment rate of individuals. represents the rate at which susceptible individuals are vaccinated. Vaccinated population further moves to the susceptible class due to the loss of acquired immunity from vaccine at a rate . Individuals exposed to the original strain of COVID-19 move to the pre-symptomatic stage at a rate 1. Pre-symptomatic individuals gain infection at a rate 2. Among the infected individuals who show the symptoms of COVID-19 are generated at a proportion . As we know, individuals infected with COVID-19 may not show the symptoms of the disease but at the same time, they are capable of infecting others. We have considered a class for these asymptomatic individuals as they play an important role in the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Among the infected individuals who do not show the symptoms of COVID-19 are generated at a proportion 1 . is the rate at which infected individuals are sent to quarantine. Symptomatic infected individuals in the 1, 2and3classes are hospitalized at a rate 1, 2and3, respectively. Individuals in the 1, 1, 2, 2, 3and3classes recover from COVID-19 at a rate 1, 1, 2, 2, 3and3, respectively. COVID-19 induced death rates for individuals in the 1, 1, 2, 2, 3and3classes are 1, 1, 2, 2, 3and3, respectively. Recovered individuals become susceptible again at a reduced rate . 2>1>1are modication parameters indicating high infectiousness of the Omicron variant and Delta variant with respect to the original strain. represents the natural death rate. 3. Mathematical analysis of the model 3.1. Local asymptotic stability of the DFE From the COVID-19 model (5), the disease-free equilibrium, 0, is obtained as 0=( ,, , =( 2 The asymptotic stability of the DFE can be established using the next-generation operator method [31,32]o n the system (5). For the system (5), using the notation of [32], the next generation matrices for the new infection terms and remaining transfer terms, denoted by and respectively, are given by = 0 1111111100 0 000 0 0 00 0 000 0 000 0 000 0 000 0 000 0 000 0 000 0 000 0 000 0 00 2222222200 0 0 00 0 000 0 000 0 0 00 0 000 0 000 0 0 00 0 000 0 000 0 000 0 000 0 00 33333333 00 0 000 0 000 0 0 00 0 000 0 000 0 000 0 000 0 000 0 0 ,Heliyon 9 (2023) e17900 5S.SahaandA.K.Saha = 3 0 0 00 0 0 00 0 00 140 0 00 0 0 00 0 0 02500 0 0 00 0 00 0 ( 1 )20600 0 0 00 0 0 000 0 3 00 0 0 00 0 00 0 0 1400 0 0 00 00 0 0 0 2700 0 00 00 0 0 0 ( 1 )20800 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 00 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 1400 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 290 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ( 1 )2010 , described in [33,34], it can be shown that the control reproduction number, denoted by , is given by =(1)=max{ 1,2,3} , (7) where, represents the spectral radius of the next generation matrix 1and 1=1111 34+1121 using Theorem 2 of [32]the following result can be established. Lemma 1. The DFE of the COVID-19 model (5), given by (6), is locally-asymptotically stable (LAS) if <1, and unstable if >1. The threshold quantity , given by (7), represents the average number of secondary infections that one infected case can produce in a completely susceptible population. Lemma1implies that, in general, when is less than one, a small influx of infected individuals into the population would not generate a large epidemic and hence the disease will be eradicated in time. However, in the subsection 3.3we will see that the disease may still exist even when <1. 3.2. Derivation of vaccine-induced herd immunity threshold to reduce the spread of COVID-19 In this subsection, we will compute the minimum number of populations that should be brought under vaccination to achieve herd immunity. To do this, we will follow the procedure as described in [35]. From equations (8), (9), and (10)we get, 1=( 1)[( 1)[( 347+22(1)12 34+312 349+33(1)12 3410)( + . (13) At the DFE, we have =+=(2+) 12. (14) Using expression (14), equations (11), (12), and (13)become 1=( 1)[ 111 34( 11 348( 12 ) +33(1)12 3410( 13 )] . (17) Now using the expressions of , , and, from equations (6)and (14), in equations (15), (17)we get 111 34( 13 To nd an expression for the vaccine-derived herd immunity threshold, we will use the expression for the basic reproduction number which is obtained by setting =0 and=0. Again, suppose that = , (21) where represents the proportion of individuals who are fully vaccinated. Thus, using the expression (21)in equations (18), (19), and (20), we obtain 1=( 1)[ 111 34( 11) +121 345( 11) +11(1)12 . (22) 2=( . (23) (24) 3 Setting 1=1in (22)and solving for , the herd immunity threshold for the model with the original strain only can be obtained as =1 1( 11 01) . (25) Similarly, setting 2=1in (23)and solving for , the herd immunity threshold for the model with the original strain and the Delta variant can be obtained as =1 2( 11 02) . (26) Finally, setting 3=1in (24)and solving for , the herd immunity threshold for the model with the original strain and the Delta and Omicron variants can be obtained as =1 3( 11 03) . (27) In general, equations (25), (26), and (27)can be written as =1 ( 11 0) . (28) It follows from (28)that <1if >1 ( 1 1 0) and hence the disease can be eliminated. Lemma1can be re-stated in terms of the herd immunity threshold as follows. Lemma 2. The DFE of the COVID-19 model (5), is locally-asymptotically stable (LAS) if >1 ( 1 1 0) and unstable if <1 ( 1 1 0) .Heliyon 9 (2023) e17900 7S.SahaandA.K.Saha 3.3. Endemic equilibrium point (EEP) and existence of backward bifurcation Setting the left-hand side of the model (5)equal to zero, we get the following system of equations: 0= + +1231, 0=[ (11)1+(12)2+(13)3] 0=2 1, 0=( 1 )2 16 1, 0=2+(12)23 2, 0=2 24 2, 0=2 27 2, 0=( 1 )2 28 2, 0=3+(13)33 3, 0=1 34 3, 0=2 39 3, 0=( backward bifurcation for the model with the original strain only First, suppose that there is only the original strain. Then we can consider 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, , , )be any arbitrary equilibrium of the model (5)when there is only the original strain and hence equation (2)can be written as 1=1(1)(1 1+ 1+1 1) (30) be the force of infection at steady-state. Therefore, from the system (29)we have, (32) where, 1=1 +1+1+1+1+1+1. After some algebraic calculation, the following polynomial equation in terms of 1can be obtained from equation (32)asHeliyon 9 (2023) e17900 8S.SahaandA.K.Saha Table 1 Numerical values of the parameters for the model (5). Parameter BaselineValues Units References 10000 Day-1Assumed of the three roots, the root 1=0, of (33), corresponds to the DFE 0. Equation (33)s a y s that the non-zero equilibria of the model satisfy ( 1)=21 12+11 1+01=0, (34) so that the quadratic (34)can be analyzed for the possibility of multiple equilibria. If multiple non-zero equilibria exist then backward bifurcation may occur. Endemic equilibria: From the above, we see that the coecient 21is always positive and 01is positive if 1is less than one and 01is negative if 1is greater than one. Hence, we have the following result. Theorem 1. The model (5)with the original strain only has (i) a unique endemic equilibrium if 01<0(i.e., 1>1), (ii) a unique endemic equilibrium if 11<0, and 01=0or 2 114 2101=0, (iii) two endemic 11<0, 01>0(i.e., 1<1) and 114 2101>0, (iv)no endemic equilibrium otherwise. Condition-i of Theorem1says that the model with the original strain only has a unique endemic equilibrium when 1>1. Using the parameter values as given in Table1with =0it can be shown that 1>1which implies there exists a unique endemic equilibrium. Again from the expressions of 1and 1, we get 1<0and 1>0. Thus according to the Center Manifold theory [37,32,38], this unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when 1>1. Hence, we have the following theorem. Theorem 2. The model (5)with the original strain only and with =0has a unique endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable when 1>1. Backward bifurcation analysis:Condition-iii of Theorem1, implies the possibility of having two endemic equilibria (co- existence of locally-asymptotically stable DFE with a locally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium) whenever 1<1and hence implies the occurrence of backward bifurcation phenomenon. Since there exists a stable endemic equilibrium with the stable DFE, the condition 1<1is no longer sucient (although necessary) for disease elimination. The signicance of the existence of backward bifurcation is that COVID-19 will persist in the community even when 1<1. Thus, disease elimination will depend not only on the condition 1<1but also on the initial sizes of the state variables of the model. Now, using the parameter values as given in Table1with =0.002, =0.000004we have 11<0and 01>0indicating the possibility of the existence of backward bifurcation. Now this will be explained using the Center Manifold theory [37,32,38]. The procedure is described inAppendix A. The Heliyon 9 (2023) e17900 9S.SahaandA.K.Saha graphical representation of the backward bifurcation of the model (5)with the original strain only is shown in Fig.2. We claim the following result. Theorem 3. The model (5)with the original strain only exhibits backward bifurcation whenever the coecients 1and 1, given by (A.3), are positive. 3.3.2. Endemic equilibria and backward bifurcation for the model with the original strain and the Delta variant Now we will consider the case when there exists the Delta variant with the original strain. Here, we will consider that the transmission rate of the Delta variant is higher than the existing one. That is, 2>1. In this case, we will not consider any term and equation involving the Omicron variant. Then we have the following theorem. Theorem that 2>1. Then 1= 1= 1= 1=0. Proof.We will prove this by the method of contradiction as described in [26]. So suppose that 2>1and also suppose that 1= 1= 1= 10. Then from the 4thand 8thequations of system (29)we have 2= 1 2 1, (35) Similarly, 2= 1 2 1, (36) And 2= 1 2 1. (37) Thus using equations (35), (36)and the 7thequation of system (29)becomes (1+) 2=2{ +(12)} (38) 2 1{ +(12)}( 1. (40) Hence equation (40)contradicts the the system (29). This implies 1= 1= 1= 1=0holds if 2>1. The detailed calculation of the endemic equilibria and the existence of backward bifurcation for the original model with the Delta variant has been provided in AppendixC. Endemic equilibria: Depending on the sign of the coecients 02, 12, and22given by (C.5)and considering the equation (C.6), we have the following result. Theorem 5. The model (5)with the original strain and the Delta variant has (i) a unique endemic equilibrium if 02<0(i.e., 2>1), (ii) a unique endemic equilibrium if 12<0, and 02=0or 2 124 2202=0, (iii) two endemic equilibria if 12<0, 02>0(i.e., 2<1) and 2 124 2202>0, (iv) no endemic equilibrium otherwise. Using the parameter values as given in Table1with =0it can be shown that 2>1which implies the existence of a unique endemic equilibrium. Also from the expressions of 2and 2, we get 2<0and 2>0. Thus according to the Center Manifold theory [37,32,38], this unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when 2>1. Hence, we have the following theorem. Theorem 6. The model (5)with the original strain and the Delta variant and with =0has a unique endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable when 2>1.Heliyon 9 (2023) e17900 10S.SahaandA.K.Saha Backward bifurcation 02>0. Thus Condition-iii of Theorem5says that the model with the original strain and the Delta variant has two endemic equilibria which indicate the possibility of the occurrence of backward bifurcation. The procedure is described in AppendixC. We claim the following result. Theorem 7. The model (5)with the original strain and the Delta variant exhibits backward bifurcation whenever the coecients 2, and2 given by (C.7)are positive. 3.3.3. Endemic equilibria and backward bifurcation for the model with the original strain and the Delta and Omicron variants Finally, we will consider the case when there exists both the Omicron variant and the Delta variant with the original strain. Theorem 8. Suppose described in Theorem4, itcan be shown that if the endemic equilibria and the existence of backward bifurcation for the original model with the Delta and Omicron variants has been provided in AppendixD. Endemic equilibria: Depending on the sign of the coecients 03, 13, and23given by (D.5)and considering the equation (D.6), we have the following theorem. Theorem 9. The model (5)with the original strain and the Delta and Omicron variants has (i) a unique endemic equilibrium if 03<0(i.e., 3>1), (ii) a unique endemic equilibrium if 13<0, and 03=0or 2 134 2303=0, (iii) two endemic equilibria if 13<0, 03>0(i.e., 3<1) and 2 134 2303>0, (iv) no endemic equilibrium otherwise. Using the parameter values as given in Table1with =0it can be shown that 3>1which implies the existence of a unique endemic equilibrium. Also from the expressions of 3and 3, we get 3<0and 3>0. Thus according to the Center Manifold theory [37,32,38], this unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when 3>1. Hence, we have the following theorem. Theorem 10. The model (5)with the original strain and the Delta and Omicron variants and with =0has a unique endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable when 3>1. Backward bifurcation analysis:Now, using the have 13<0and 03>0. Thus Condition-iii of Theorem9says that the model with the original strain and the Delta and Omicron variants has two endemic equilibria which indicate the possibility of the existence of backward bifurcation. The procedure is described in AppendixD. We claim the following result. Theorem 11. The model (5)with the original strain and the Delta and Omicron variants exhibit backward bifurcation whenever the coe- cients 3, and3given by (D.7)are positive. 3.4.

The region , given by equation (41), is positively-invariant and attracting with respect to the model (5). Proof.Using the same procedure as described in [6]and performing some calculations, it can be easily shown that the region is positively-invariant and attracting. Now, we claim the following theorem.Heliyon 9 (2023) e17900 11S.SahaandA.K.Saha Fig. 2.Backwardbifurcationofthemodel( 5)withtheoriginalstrainonly.ParametervaluesareusedasgiveninTable 1with=0.002,=0.000004.

Results and discussions Numerical simulations of the COVID-19 original strain with the Delta and Omicron variants in the form of model (5)are performed and results have been discussed in this section. To perform numerical simulations we consider that the new variant is more infectious than the previous ones and we use the parameter values as given in Table1. Values of parameters with the same biological meaning are taken from some already-existing articles. Some parameter values are obtained by tting the daily infected cases of the USA with our model solution using the MATLAB fminsearchbnd function. Some values are estimated from available COVID-19 data and sources from published articles. Other parameter values are assumed. 4.1. Model validation In this section, real data of daily infected cases for the entire USA population [2]is shown using bar diagram (blue colored) and in the same gure window we have drawn the infected class of our model to compare our model with the real-time data and hence to verify the reliability of our model.

Eect of the emergence of new Sars-CoV-2 variants Now we will discuss the eect of the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants (Delta and Omicron) on daily infected cases, daily hospitalized cases, and daily death cases. For this, we will consider three cases: Case 1:Existence of the original strain only. Case 2:Existence of the original strain with the Delta variant. Case 3:Existence of the original strain with the Delta and Omicron variants. Fig.4depicts the eect of the emergence of new variants of concern on the daily infected cases. Fig.4(a) shows that when there is no other variant other than the original one, the maximum number of daily infected cases is 240893which occurs on January 2, 2021 After that, the number of daily infected cases starts decreasing. Again from August 9, 2021, the number of daily infected cases starts increasing and we witness a second wave where the peak value (80152) is much smaller than the previous peak. But considering the existence of the Delta variant with the original one (Fig.4(b)), we see that the second wave starts faster (May 20, 2021) than the previous case (Fig.4(a)) and here the peak value is 215331which occurs on August 4, 2021, and is almost close to the rst peak for the original strain. This gure also shows a third wave which starts on January 10, 2022, and here the peak value (72106) is much smaller than the peaks observed in the rst wave and the second wave respectively. Again, considering both the Delta variant and Omicron variant with the original strain (Fig.4(c)), it is seen that the third wave emerges faster (November 29, 2021) than the previous case (Fig.4(b)) and here the peak value is (928719) which occurs on January 12, 2022, and is much much larger than the peak occurred in the third wave of the second case. This gure also exhibits the starting of a fourth wave. These results suggest that during the time period considered in this simulation, total infected cases increase by 14% due to the presence of the Delta variant. Cumulative infected cases almost doubled when both the Delta and Omicron variants are present. Similarly, during this time period cumulative death cases increase by 5.4% due to the emergence of the Delta variant (Fig.6(b)), and death cases increase by 19% if both the Delta and Omicron variants appear (Fig.6(c)). The same pattern is observed for daily hospitalized cases (Fig.5). Thus, from these discussions, it is clear that the number of infected cases, hospitalized cases, and death cases increase due to the presence of Delta and Omicron variants. 4.3. Global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis Now to identify which parameters have a greater impact on the dynamics of our model, we perform global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis [39,40]. For this, we applied the method discussed in [41]t o our model. In this paper, we have sampled 37 parameters of our model using Latin hyperbolic sampling and considering uniform distribution. Parameters with PRCC values greater or equal to 0.5and less or equal to 0.5are considered to be highly correlated with the response function [42]. Performing the global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for the symptomatic infected class (1) of the model with the original strain only and the model parameters (Fig.7(a)), we see that the top-ranked parameters those can aect the dynamics of the model (5)with the original strain only are 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, , , , . Again considering 1as the response function (Fig.7(b)), it is seen that parameters those aect the dynamics of the model (5)w i t h original variant only are 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, , . Again performing the global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for the symptomatic infected class (2) of the model with the original strain and the Delta Heliyon 9 (2023) e17900 13S.SahaandA.K.Saha Fig. 5.Simulation of the model (5)showing the eect of variants of concern (Delta and Omicron) on daily hospitalized cases for the model (5). Fig.5(a) shows the simulation result when there is only the original strain. Fig.5(b) shows the simulation result when there exists the Delta variant with the original strain. Fig.5(c) shows the simulation result when there exist both the Delta and Omicron variants with the original strain.

Fig.6(c) shows the simulation result when there exist both the Delta and Omicron variants with the original strain. variant and the model parameters (Fig.8(a)), it is observed that the top-ranked parameters are 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, , , , those can control the dynamics of the model. Again considering 2as the response function (Fig.8(b)), it is seen that parameters that aect the dynamics of the model (5)w i t h the original strain and the Delta variant are 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, , . Similarly calculating the global sensitivity analysis for the symptomatic infected class (3) of the model with the original strain and the Delta and Omicron variants and the model parameters (Fig.9(a)), it is observed that parameters that can aect the model dynamics are 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, , , , . Parameters 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, , are found as the top-ranked parameters while performing global uncertainty analysis for the response function 3and the model parameters (Fig.9(b)). 4.4. Eect of vaccination The impact of vaccination coverage is assessed by simulating the model (5)with dierent values of vaccination rate (). For this, we have considered BNT162b2 vaccine against the original strain of COVID-19 and its two other variants: Delta and Omicron. As it is observed that due to the change in genetic pattern, new variants of concern are emerging very frequently, and hence vaccine ecacy ()may change over time. The results obtained from the simulation are depicted in Fig.10.From this gure, a signicant decrease in daily infected cases, daily hospitalized cases, and daily deaths are observed when the vaccination rate is increased.

If 25% of the population are vaccinated the peak of the daily infected cases decreases by 41%. The peak value of daily infected cases further decreases by 17% when 50% of the population is vaccinated. The gure further depicts a 12% decrease in the peak value of daily infected cases when 90% of the population is vaccinated. Similar trends are observed in daily hospitalized cases and daily death cases with an increasing rate of vaccine coverage. As a whole Fig.10shows that the peak of daily infected cases, daily hospitalized cases, and daily death cases can be decreased with an increase in the vaccination rate. To assess the combined eect of vaccine coverage and vaccine ecacy, contour plot of the control reproduction number of the model (5)as a function of vaccine ecacy ()and the fraction of the population fully vaccinated ()is presented in Fig.11. Fig.11(a) shows that when there exists only the original Heliyon 9 (2023) e17900 15S.SahaandA.K.Saha Fig. 10.Simulation of the model (5)showing the eect of vaccine coverage ()on daily infected cases, daily hospitalized cases, and daily deaths.

Fig.11(b) shows that when there exists the Delta variant with the original strain, herd immunity can be achieved if 75% population is vaccinated with vaccines having 85% ecacy. Fig.11(c) shows that when there exists both the Delta variant and Omicron variant with the original strain, herd immunity can be achieved if 80% population is vaccinated with vaccines having 90% ecacy. 4.5. Eect of mask coverage The impact of mask coverage ()and mask ecacy ()is also evaluated by simulating the model (5)w i t h dierent values of mask coverage and mask ecacy. Here we have considered three types of masks of dierent ecacy: cloth mask (30% mask (95% ecacy). The results are presented in Fig.12. These results show that the peak of the daily infected cases, daily hospitalized cases, and daily death cases decrease remarkably with the increase in mask coverage particularly if the moderately eective surgical masks and highly eective N95 masks are used even when vaccine coverage is kept Heliyon 9 (2023) e17900 16S.SahaandA.K.Saha Fig. 12.Simulation of the model (5) showing the eect of mask quality ()and mask coverage (). Fig.12(a), (d), and (g) show the daily infected cases, daily hospitalized cases, and daily deaths when cloth mask is used with dierent mask coverage rate. Fig.12(b), (e), and (h) show the daily infected cases, daily hospitalized cases, and daily deaths when surgical mask is used with dierent mask coverage rate. Fig.12(c), (f), and (i) show the daily infected cases, daily hospitalized cases, and daily deaths when N95 mask is used with dierent mask coverage rate. at the baseline value.For instance, Fig.12(b) and (c) show a 20% and 35% decrease in the peak of daily infected cases when 50% of the total population wear surgical masks and N95 masks respectively. The gure also shows that if 70% of the total population uses face masks of the above-mentioned two types, the peak of the daily infected cases again decreases by 30% and 60% respectively. This gure does not show any signicant decrease in the peak of daily infected cases in the case of less eective cloth masks. Thus these gures show that in reducing the peak of daily cases, N95 mask quality is proved to be highly eective which is followed by surgical masks. Our results also show that a 45% increase in the baseline value of surgical mask coverage proves to be more eective than a 25% increase in the baseline value of N95 mask coverage. Similarly, we can say that ensuring maximum number of people in the community wearing a moderate mask is more important than fewer people wearing highly eective face masks. These analyses also suggest that fewer people reluctant to use a highly eective N95 mask are less harmful than more people reluctant to use a moderately eective surgical mask. Simulations are also carried out to assess the combined eect of mask coverage and mask ecacy using contour plot of the control reproduction number of the model (5)as a function of mask coverage and mask ecacy and is presented in Fig.13. Fig.13(a) shows that when there exists only the original strain, COVID-19 can be eliminated if 50% population uses face masks having 3% ecacy. Fig.13(b) shows that when there exists the Delta variant with the original strain, COVID-19 can be eliminated if 65% population uses face masks having 85% ecacy. Fig.13(c) shows that when there exists both the Delta and Omicron variants with the original strain, COVID-19 can be eliminated if 0% population uses face masks having 95% ecacy. 4.6. Combined eect of vaccination and mask coverage Numerical simulation of the model (5)is also carried out to assess the combined eect of mask coverage and vaccine coverage on the peak of daily infected cases, daily hospitalized cases, and daily deaths. The simulation results are presented in Fig.14. Fig.14 (a) shows that when no vaccine is implemented and 25% individuals use face masks, the peak of the daily infected case is 1478910. But when 25% of the individual is vaccinated and 50% individual use face masks the peak of the daily infected cases decreases by 61%. Further, a 40% decrease is observed when 50% of the individual is vaccinated and 70% individual use face masks. Again, a 52% decrease is observed when 90% of the individual is vaccinated and 90% individual use face masks. Similar trends are observed for the daily hospitalized case (Fig.14(b)) and for the daily death cases (Fig.14(c)). This simulation suggests that more reduction in the peak of daily infected cases can be achieved if both the vaccine coverage rate and mask coverage rate are increased simultaneously. 5. Conclusion To understand the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the presence of new variants, a mathematical model considering Delta and Omicron variants with the original strain was proposed and formulated. In this work, our focus was mainly on assessing the impact of introducing new SARS-CoV-2 variants: Delta and Omicron whose contagiousness were assumed to be greater than the Heliyon 9 (2023) e17900 17S.SahaandA.K.Saha Fig. 13.Contour plot of the control reproduction number of the model (5)as a function of mask coverage ()and mask ecacy ().

Fig.14(a), (b), and (c) show the daily infected cases, daily hospitalized cases, and daily deaths respectively. original strain. Mathematical analysis was performed to calculate the control reproduction number and to prove the global stability of the DFE when <1. Vaccine derived herd immunity threshold was then calculated to determine the minimum number of individuals who should be vaccinated to acquire immunity against COVID-19. Then we proved a theorem for the existence of the endemic equilibria. After that, it was shown that there exists a unique endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotic stable when >1, =1, 2, 3. The model also exhibits backward bifurcation phenomena for all the three strains considered separately when <1, =1, 2, 3. Numerical simulations were carried out to support the theoretical results and to show the eect of Delta and Omicron variants on the dynamics of COVID-19. Numerical results show that whenever a new more contagious variant emerges and becomes dominant, the preexisting variant becomes weak and disappears. It was also observed that due to the emergence of more contagious and potential variants, new waves of COVID-19 arrive which might become more dangerous resulting in more infections and more deaths. This implies that vaccination alone will not be sucient to eliminate COVID-19. In numerical simulations, the eect of mask coverage with dierent mask ecacy has also been assessed. But the use of face masks and other non-pharmaceutical interventions can not guarantee the elimination of COVID-19. Again numerical simulations were carried out to assess the impact of vaccines of dierent ecacy. The results showed that new waves appear after a few days despite the highly eective vaccines being administered. This is happening due to the emergence of Delta and Omicron variants. Since most of the vaccines were designed to Heliyon 9 (2023) e17900 18S.SahaandA.K.Saha ght against the wild strain, they work eciently against the original strain but the emergence of new and more dangerous variants weakens their eectiveness. Further numerical simulations were carried out to present the eect of the combination of face masks and vaccines. From the simulation, it was observed that a combination of face masks and vaccines can eliminate the maximum number of daily cases compared to the use of face masks and vaccines alone. Accordingly, the study suggests that a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination programs should be continued to control the disease outbreak. On the whole, the study found that the presence of both the Delta and Omicron variants along with the original strain almost doubled the number of infections and increased the number of deaths by about 19%. Therefore our study suggests that more dosages of vaccines and new more eective vaccines should be provided in the community to control the new variants.

Backward bifurcation for the model with the original strain only We will discuss the backward bifurcation phenomenon using the Center Manifold theory [37,32]. For this let us consider the changes of in vector form the model (5) can be written as =(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), where =(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)and then we have 1 =1= +2+91111, 2 =2=1(11)1222, e17900 19S.SahaandA.K.Saha (0) = 101111100 2012212000 00 313313000 00 1400 000 000 250 000 000 ( 1 )206000 000 0 01100 000 simple zero eigenvalue (with all other eigenvalues having negative real part). Hence, the Center Manifold theory [37,32], can be used to analyze the dynamics of the model (5). Eigenvectors of 1=(0)||||1= 1: When 1=1, the jacobian ( 1) of (A.1)has a right eigenvector given by =[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2,3=3,4=1 43,5=2 54, a left eigenvector =[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1)) [37,38]: After some tedious global stability of the DFE for the model (Theorem 12)) Proof.To prove the global stability of the DFE, =1{ 1(+(11))31} +2(1141)+3(2151)+4{ (1)2161} can be shown that 1(11+1+11)(11). (B.1) following 2=52+62+72+82 =5{ 2(+(12))32} +6(1242)+7(2272)+8{ (1)2282} After some rigorous calculations, it can be shown that 2(22+2+22)(21).

Therefore, is a Lyapunov function on and thus it follows by the LaSalle's invariance principle [43]that, the DFE of the model (5)is globally asymptotic stable whenever 1. Appendix C.

Therefore, from the system (29)we have, After some algebraic calculation, the following polynomial equation in terms of 2can be obtained from equation the root 2=0, of (C.4), corresponds to the DFE 0. Equation (C.4)says that the 22+12 2+02=0.
