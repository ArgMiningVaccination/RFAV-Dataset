Parikh's commentary (June 26 Readers' Forum) repeatedly states that vaccinating our children equals health for our children. We all want healthy children, and some vaccines are very important. But there are serious problems with our current overly aggressive vaccine schedule, current toxic vaccine ingredients, and the blind faith that vaccines can fix all of our health problems. Dr. Parikh gives a few examples of children who have died or have been inconvenienced from illnesses that we have vaccines for. What Dr. Parikh doesn't mention at all in his biased essay is the many thousands of children who have died or have suffered irreparable neurologic injury from the vaccines themselves. Many vaccines today are still loaded with toxic mercury and aluminum \u2014 both serious neurotoxins that have been associated with low IQ, ADHD and behavior problems, and even dementia and autism. Heavy metals are also well-known to suppress and damage the immune system's delicate balance, thereby increasing the incidence of illnesses like asthma, allergies and autoimmune disorders \u2014 all of which are epidemic today. Dr. Parikh also attacks Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the original courageous researcher who discovered serious bowel inflammation and neurologic injury associated with the measles virus from the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. In fact, Dr. Wakefield's results have been confirmed by other independent laboratories, and much of his subsequent persecution has been likened to a hysterical witch hunt, heavily funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the most powerful group that stands to lose from this information. Again, we all want healthy children, but simple measures like maximizing your child's vitamin D levels, optimizing their nutrition, and not poisoning them with heavy metals and chemicals from our environment can go a long way toward preventing disease. Common sense ideas like using vaccines free of Thimerisol (a mercury-containing preservative), not vaccinating a sick child or premature infant, not using Acetominophen (which depletes glutathione) before or after vaccines, and not combining too many vaccines at one visit can go a long way toward protecting our children from serious vaccine consequences. While some vaccines are important, as a society, we need to realize that we can't vaccinate our way to health.
