Publisher Copyright: (CMT1A) is a rare, orphan, hereditary neuromuscular disorder with no cure and for which only symptomatic treatment is currently available. A previous phase 2 trial has shown preliminary evidence of efficacy for PXT3003 in treating CMT1A. This phase 3, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study further investigated the efficacy and safety high- or low-dose PXT3003 (baclofen/naltrexone/D-sorbitol [mg]: 6/0.70/210 or 3/0.35/105) in treating subjects with mild to moderate CMT1A. Methods: In this study, 323 subjects with mild-to-moderate CMT1A were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 5 mL of high- or low-dose PXT3003, or placebo, orally twice daily for up to 15 months. Efficacy was assessed using the change in Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale total score from baseline to months 12 and 15 (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints included the 10-m walk test and other assessments. The high-dose group was discontinued early due to unexpected crystal formation in the high-dose formulation, which resulted in an unanticipated high discontinuation rate, overall and especially in the high-dose group. The statistical analysis plan was adapted to account for the large amount of missing data before database lock, and a modified full analysis set was used in the main analyses. Two sensitivity analyses were performed to check the interpretation based on the use of the modified full analysis set. Results: High-dose PXT3003 demonstrated significant improvement in the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale total score vs placebo (mean difference: 0.37 points; 97.5% CI [ 0.68 to 0.06]; p = 0.008), and consistent treatment effects were shown in the sensitivity analyses. Both PXT3003 doses were safe and well-tolerated. Conclusion: The high-dose group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint and a good safety profile. Overall, high-dose PXT3003 is a promising treatment option for patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A.
