The determination of Prakriti has significant importance in both healthy and unhealthy states which can be applied clinically in diagnos is, treatment (for deciding appropriate drug, dose, duration , diet and life style ) and prognosis of the disease as well as for promotion of health by following daily and seasonal regimens according to Prakriti . Looking at the emerging global popularity of Ayurveda, the Council has undertaken the task to develop and standardize a Prakriti assessment questionnaire which can encompass the minute details of features/ characteristics of a person as described in Ayurvedic Classics with rationale, reliability and validity . The core objective was to develop a comprehensive Scale for Prakriti assessment which should be able to capture the Prakriti of an individual with the help of simple, valid, reliable, user friendly and globally acceptable questionnaire with maximum objectivity. The work done during the reporting period: I. Primary feasibility / inter - rater agreement study (double blind) for validation of the Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire/ Scale has been carried out through multi -centric studies at 10 participating centres which includes II. The Questionnaire/ Scale have been a ssessed on 50 participants by two Investigators separately at each center through the Web based Data capturing form. III. The data of each centre was collected and verified on monthly basis. IV. The data thus generated on 5 00 healthy volunteers at 10 centers has b een analyzed centre -wise and collectively using appropriate statistical method i.e. Kappa & weighted Kappa to see inter rater agreement. V. A consultative meeting of investigators and experts has been held on 16th&17th February 2018 to discuss the results. Based on the inputs of the investigators and experts, certain modifications were made as required to the questionnaire. VI. The modified Questionnaire/Scale was again assessed on 10 healthy volunteers by two investigators at the same 10 participating centers and the inter -rater agreement was again rechecked to see the validity of the modified questionnaire. VII. The final document on SoP's for Prakriti Assessment has been prepared and applied for copy - right. VIII. The online Ayur -Prakriti Portal has been designed in ac cordance with the modified Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire/Scale. 101 5.2.5 Evaluation of Add on Efficacy & Safety of an Ayurvedic coded Formulation in the management of Dengue Fever & Prevention of its complications 1.

Every year, 15 million people die from a NCD between the ages of 30 and 69 years; over 80% of these \"premature\" deaths occur in low - and middle -income countries. Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, followed by Cancers (8.8 millio n), respiratory diseases (3.9million), and Diabetes (1.6 million).These 4 groups of diseases account for over 80% of all premature NCD deaths. It is projected that globally NCDs will account for nearly 44 million deaths in 2020 (Global status re port on non - communicable diseases 2010). Keeping in view the mortality rate due to NCDs the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has launched the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseas es and Stroke (NPCDCS) in 2008, to prevent the projected increase in the burden of Non -Communicable Diseases, on pilot basis and thereafter it was launched in 21 states during the year 2010 -12 with the aim of health promotion; prevention and control of NCD s through early screening. The leading cause of NCDs is lifestyle changes and Ayurveda, the age old indigenous system of health care primarily focuses on prevention of diseases through life style modifications. Therefore it was felt that AYUSH (Ayurveda) i nterventions (based on the fundamental concepts) can play a pivotal role in prevention, control and treatment of NCDs. With this view, several meetings were held under the chairmanship of Secretary, AYUSH, Ministry of AYUSH and officials of Directorate Gen eral of Health Services, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and arrived at a conclusion to initiate the programme \"Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda) with NPCDCS programme\" through CCRAS for in Bhilwara (Rajasthan), Sur endranagar (Gujarat), Gaya (Bihar) to prevent and control the projected increase in the burden of NCDs through early screening. Therefore, in view of the above, Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani & Homoeopathy) for promotion of health and prevent ion of diseases has been made one of the mandates of NPCDCS programme. Therefore the aforesaid programme was launched at 3 districts viz. Surendranagar (Gujarat), Bhilwara (Rajasthan) and Gaya (Bihar) having Dte.GHS would provide support for basic laboratory investigations through its CHCs and requisite support (tran sportation etc.) for organizing camps. The main objectives of this programme are as under: Integration of Ayurveda to the existing healthcare system for promotion, prevention and control of non -communicable diseases through NPCDCS program. Early diagnosis of NCDs for management through food & life style changes through principles of Ayurveda. In chronic cases , to reduce drug dependency through Ayurveda, Yoga practices and Lifestyle changes. As an adjuvant therapy to reduce complications and associated sympt oms. 157 Capacity building of human resources Evaluation, monitoring and Surveillance of NCDs The detail s about identified 03 districts are as under: Table - 58: Districts selected for integrating NPCDCS Sl.

GHS, Nirman Bhawan, an outside expert from Reputed Institution and representatives from District authorities to evaluate the modus operandi of the programme and also to evaluate the work done during particular quarter, so that corrective measures, if any, may be suggested to the implementing authorities . Further, it helps in assessing that how economically resources or inputs (such as funds, expertise and time) are being converted in to results. In view of the above, Quarterly Monitoring visits were condu cted at Bhilwara (Rajasthan), Surendranagar (Gujarat) 2017, 27th- 28th October 2017 , 6th -7th April and 16th and 17th June 2017 respectively. The Quarterly Monitoring Committee in all three districts found that the services provided in AYUSH -NPCDCS Clinics were instrumental in achieving the goals of lowering the burden of NCDs in these areas and also create awareness to protect the health by adopting Ayurvedic intervention, Lifestyle modifications and Yoga practices. The Committee appreciated the work done so far and supposed that this programme will be success with visible improvement, if sufficient basic facilities are provided. 158 Further, an Interim -analysis has revealed that the dosage or components of Conventional medicines/prescription were either reduced or discontinued, in consultation and supervision of Allopathic doctors, after integrating the intervention of Ayur veda, lifestyle modification & Yoga in patients of Diabetes and Hypertension.
