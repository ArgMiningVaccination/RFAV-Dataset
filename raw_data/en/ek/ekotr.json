There aremany who have believed itto consist exclusively inoutward mortification, inother bodily sulferings and chastisements. Others again, and especially women, think that they have reached theclimax ofperfection, when they say many prayers, attend many services andoffices, andareregularly atChurch andatCommunion. Some indeed, (and amongst this class nota few Religious persons who have withdrawn themselves from theworld,) persuade themselvesOFCHRISTIAN PERFECTION that perfection entirely depends onthe regular attendance atthe Hours ofprayer, onsilence, solitude, and exact observance ofRule. And thus, some inthese, and others inthose external actions suppose perfection toconsist. But they arealldeceived. For although these practices are sometimes means ofgaining the spirit ofperfection, and sometimes areitsfruits, yet innosense can itever besaid that true spiritual perfection consists inthese. Unquestionably they are means most effica cious forobtaining spirituality, when they are properly and discreetly ;forbythem wegain strength against ourown sinfulness and frailty, wearefortified and snares ofour common enemies, and, inshort, areprovided with those spiritual helps, which are necessary toallthe servants ofGod, and especially tothose who have but lately entered His service. They arealso oftheSpirit who and silence theleast occasions ofsin,and tohave their conversation inHeaven, and who give them selves entirely tothe Service ofGod and to works ofmercy; who pray, and meditate uponOFCHRISTIAN PERFECTION the Life and Passion ofJesus Christ, not for thesake ofcuriosity and devotional feeling, but that they may gain deeper knowledge oftheir own corruptness and ofGod's Mercy and Good ness, and that they may bemore and more inflamed with and bytaking the Cross shoulders; who frequent the Holy Sacraments with theview ofglorifying the Divine Majesty, that they may bemore closely united with God, and gain fresh strength against their enemies. To others, however, who found perfection entirely onexternal practices, such works may bring greater ruin than open sins; notthat these works arebad ofthem they have this sad result ;because those who practise them are sowrapt upinwhat they do, that they leave their hearts aprey totheir own evil inclinations and tothe devices ofSatan. He sees them wandering from the right path, and notonly does heleave them tothe enjoyment ofthese exercises, butletsthem vainly fancy that they are roaming amidst the delights ofPara dise, and persuade themselves that they are borne upwards even tothe angelic choirs, andOFCHRISTIAN PERFECTION that they feel thePresence ofGod within them. Such persons sometimes are soabsorbed in curious, deep, delightful thoughts, that they become asitwere oblivious oftheworld and of allcreatures, and appear tothemselves rapt even tothethird heaven. But inhow great anerror these persons have entangled themselves, and how far they are distant from that true perfection which weseek, may easily begathered from their lives and conversation. For ineverything, whether itbe great orsmall, they seek their own advantage, and like tobepreferred before others ;they are self-willed and opinionated, blind totheir own faults, sharp-sighted forthefaults ofothers, and severely condemn the sayings and doings of other men. Butifyou touch only with your finger acertain vain reputation inwhich they hold themselves, and arepleased tobeheld byothers ;ifyou bid them discontinue any oftheir regular and formal devotions, they are atonce angry and exceed ingly disturbed. And ifGod Himself visits them with trials and infirmities, (which never come without His appointment orpermission, and which are the tests ofHis servants' faithfulness,) orifHeper mits them tobesorely persecuted inorder and bebrought back totheway oftrue perfec tion, immediately the false foundation isdis covered, and the miserable condition ofthe proud heart isseen. For inallevents, whether adverse orprosperous, they are unwilling tobe resigned and tohumble themselves under the mighty hand ofGod, acquiescing inHis just though hidden judgments ;neither will they, in imitation ofthe most lowly and patient Son of God, abase themselves below allcreatures, and love their persecutors andenemies asdear friends, because they are the instruments ofDivine Goodness, and work together fortheir mortifica tion, perfection and salvation. Itistherefore quite evident, that allsuch persons are ingreat danger. For since the inward eyeisdarkened, bywhich they seethem selves and their outward actions which aregood, they attribute tothemselves ahigh degree of perfection, and so,becoming more and more puffed up, they readily pass judgment upon others; yet they themselves need aspecial miracle ofgrace toconvert them, fornothing short ofthat would have Itismore toconvert and bring back sinner whose sinishidden andmantled with thesemblance ofvirtue. You clearly and distinctly see, then, from what Ihave said, that the essence ofthe spiriOF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION tual else Goodness tothe Pleasure ;moreover, inwilling anddoing allthis with honour ofGod, thefulfilment ofHisWill because itisHis Will, and because He served and loved. This isthelawoflove engraven onthehearts isrequired ofus. This isHis yoke and light burden. This isthat obedience towhich ourRedeemer and Master calls affections. Ingreat matters aswell asinsmall, itisnecessary, then, that you prepare yourself and hold yourself inreadiness forthis conflict, forheonly will becrowned who was brave inthebattle.OFCHRISTIAN Doubtless this isthehardest ofallstruggles, because byfighting against ourselves, weare, at the same time, attacked byourselves, and on that account the victory obtained insuch a conflict will beofallothers the most glorious and most dear toGod. Therefore, ifyou used every endeavour to mortify yourself, and totread down your inordi nate affections, inclinations, and rebellious pas sions, even inthesmallest matters, you would be rendering toGod afargreater and more accept able service, than ifwhilst permitting some of your inclinations toremain unmortified, you scourged yourself until you bled, fasted more rigorously, and practised anausterity greater than that towill andperform that which isinitself more excellent, butthat which God before allelse strictly desires and requires ofyou. For He doubtless seeks anddesires ofyouself-conquest, and thethorough mortification ofyour passions, rather than leaving one ofthem alive inyou, should perform insome other direction some greater and more notable service forHis sake. Now you seewherein thereal perfection ofa8 OFDISTRUST OF OURSELVES Christian lies, and that toobtain ityou must enter upon aconstant and sharp warfare against self; you must provide yourself with four very safe and highly necessary weapons, that youmay win thepalm, and befinally aconqueror inthis Distrust ofself .... I. Trust inGod II. Spiritual Exercises ...III. Prayer IV. Concerning allthese, with God's help, we intend plainly and briefly totreat. CHAPTER II. ffifDistrust ofSDursdoeis. DISTRUST ofyourself issonecessary in thespiritual combat, that without ityou may beassured that you will neither gain the desired victory, nor beable toovercome even the weakest ofyour passions. You must be firmly convinced inyour mind that this isthe case, forweare too prone through our natural corruption tomake afalse estimate ofourselves ; sothat, though weare absolutely nothing, we persuade ourselves that weare something, and presume without theslightest foundation onour own strength.OFDISTRUST This certain truth, that HeAlone istheSource ofallgood, and that all virtue and grace descend from Him tous,and that from ourselves nothing can come, not even agood thought, which would beworthy ofHis approval. Yet, although this most necessary self-distrust isitself the work ofthe Divine Hand, and is wont tobebestowed byGod upon His friends, sometimes bymeans ofholy inspirations, some times bysharp chastisements, sometimes by violent and almost insurmountable temptations, atother times byways not understood byus, nevertheless itisHis will that wealso, asfaras we can, should doour part ;Iwill therefore propose toyou four means, bywhich, relying chiefly onGod's assistance, you may beable to acquire self-distrust. The first is,tomeditate upon and torecognize your own vileness and nothingness, and thefact that ofyourself you candonogood thing, where bytodeserve anentrance into the Heavenly Kingdom. The second is,toseek from the Lord with fervent and humble prayers this self-distrust ; seeing itisHis gift. Inorder toobtain that you arewholly unable of yourself togain it. Inthis way, present yourself again and again before the Divine Majesty, with the assurance that ofHisgoodness Hewill grant your request ; endure the delay, however long, which His providence may appoint, and persevere; and without doubt you shall obtain it. The third is,tolive incontinual fear ofyour self, ofyour own judgment, ofyour great ness tosin;and ofthecountless enemies, against whom you are ofyourself utterly powerless, of their great experience inthis warfare, their wiles, their capability oftransforming themselves into angels oflight, their innumerable snares and traps which they secretly spread inthevery way itself ofholiness. The fourth is,that assoon asyou have had any fall, you should enter atonce more deeply and more consciously into the consideration of your own feebleness. Itwasforthispurpose God permitted you tofall, that, being warned in wardly byinspiration, byaclearer light than before, you might, knowing yourself well, learn todespise yourself, and toregard yourself as something vile and ofnoaccount, and tobe willing that others should view you inthe same light. Otherwise you will never attain toaOFDISTRUST OFOURSELVES virtuous self-distrust, which isbased ongenuine humility asthat wehave spoken of. This self-knowledge isclearly necessary for any one who seeks tohave union with the supreme Light and uncreated Truth, and this theDivine Mercy teaches tothe proud and to thepresumptuous commonly through their falls ; suffering them tofallinto some sin,which they thought there was nochance oftheir doing, sothat, gaining inthis experimental way self- knowledge, hasnotrecourse tosomiserable aremedy asthis, have been tried, and have failed towork allthe good the Divine (asinthecase ofthe Blessed Virgin Mary,) there would benofall. earnestly seek from theLord the-true Light whereby you may know yourself, and entirely distrust yourself, ifyou donotwant tofallagain, and perhaps the next time into deeper sin.OF TRUST INGOD CHAPTER III. 8Dftttust in\u00aeoD. ALTHOUGH, aswehave said, self-distrust isessential for this spiritual nevertheless italone would not beenough, for then weshould trust inGod, inthe and expectation that Alone will vouchsafe to usevery good thing weneed \u2014-His help, and the victory. From ourselves indeed, who are nothing, we can expect nothing butfalls, forwhich cause we ought entirely todistrust ourselves; but, with the help ofour Lord, wemay beassured of success atalltimes; provided that toobtain aid, wearm our hearts with alively con fidence inHim. Four means will help usto First, God togrant ittous. Secondly, bykeeping theeyeoffaith fixed on theimmense Power and infinite Wisdom ofGod, with Whom nothing iseither impossible or difficult ;byconsidering that His Goodness is unbounded, and that His willingness and desire togive, each hour and moment, whatever may beOF TRUST INGOD 13 needful forthe spiritual toHis arms. For ifour Divine Shepherd forthirty-three years followed after His lost sheep, with cries so piercing that His voice grew hoarse, through a road sorough and thorny that Heshed allHis blood upon it,and laid down His life, will He notnow\u2014when thepoor sheep follows Him by obeying His commands, oratleast with the desire ofdoing so(though sometimes feeble), when itcalls upon Him and entreats Him, will Henotnow cast upon itthe life-giving glance ofHis Countenance, hear itscry, layitupon His Divine Shoulders, rejoicing with allHis neighbours and with theAngels ofHeaven spared nopains and dumb sinner, the lost coin oftheGospel, isitpossible that He would turn away from one who, like alostsheep, calls and cries piteously after theshepherd? And canitbeimagined, that God, Who knocks continually atthedoor ofman's heart, that He might enter inand supthere, and communicate His gifts, would, when invited byman toenter into that heart, turn adeaf ear, and refuse to come in? The third way ofgaining this holy confidence insomany places, that noone who trusted inGod has ever been brought toconfusion. The fourth means isthis, (and this will serve both toacquire distrust ofself, aswell astrust inGod,) \u2014when any thing occurs or some struggle with selfhastobemet, and you desire toovercome yourself, before you propose ormake any resolution, consider first your own weakness; then, fullofself-distrust, turn tothe Divine Power, Wisdom and Goodness, and in reliance upon these, commence the action or conflict with fearlessness. Armed with these weapons, and with prayer (ofwhich Ishall speak presently), goforth tobattle and toaction. Unless you observe this order, though you may think you areacting inreliance upon God, you will find generally that you are mistaken. For presumption issonatural and common to man, and withal sosubtle, that itsecretly under animagined self-distrust, wefancy weplace asfaraspossible, from presumption, and towork inthespirit ofself- distrust and trust inGod, the consideration of your own weakness must gobefore the con sideration ofGod's power, and both should hehas gained this spirit of self-distrust and trust inGod, when hehasreally nothing give way and despairingly complain that you can make noprogress, such feelings evidently show that you have been trusting inyourself and notinGod. And ifyour sadness and discouragement is much, then, there can benodoubt, that your trust inselfwasmuch, and your trust inGod but little. For hewho much distrusts himself and trusts inGod, when hefalls, isnot ;because heknows hisfallisowing tohis own weakness, and placed inGod. Ontheother hand, ashegrows inself-distrust, somore and more does hehumbly trust inGod ; and hating intensely hissinand the rebellious passions which caused hisfall, and mourning over itwith adeep, calm, and meek sorrow,16 OFTIMIDITY because oftheoffence against God, heatonce resumes hisefforts, and pursues hisenemies with new resolution and energy even tothedeath. Iwish that some persons \u2014who think them selves spiritual \u2014would well consider these things; who cannot, orwill not, give themselves amoment's peace, when they have committed a fault Such persons rush offtotheir spiritual father chiefly torelieve themselves oftheir anxiety and vexation, which arise from self-love more than from any thing else, although their first concern should betobecleansed from thestain oftheir sins, and tobefortified These consider thefearfulness and restlessness which follow upon sinavirtuous feeling, (for it isaccompanied byacertain dissatisfaction with one's self,) and donot see that itsprings from asecret pride and from presumption, which are based onself-trust and self-reliance. Thinking themselves tobesomething, they have placedOFDISTRUST OFSELF I7 toomuch trust intheir own strength. Their fall has obliged them tomake the discovery that they donotpossess this strength, and thus they are cast down and are full ofwonder, asif something extraordinary had happened ;and they become timid, because that trust inthem selves, upon which they had foolishly leant, had given way. The humble man knows nosuch experience, forhissole trust isinGod. Heplaces noreliance onhis own hefalls the fall principally depends upon distrust ofself and trust inGod, Iwould furnish you with further counsels, that through thehelp ofGod you may attain this grace. Concerning distrust inself, itisabove all important that you should know and befully persuaded that notallgifts, whether natural or18 hastobeconquered, inevery danger which has tobeavoided, Therefore weought tobear this inmind throughout our whole life\u2014every day, every hour, every moment ;and never allow thatthere andtobefullbeyond description ties;letsuch asoul have every means andspiri tual exercise inorder progress ;nay, onthecontrary, haveOFSPIRITUAL EXERCISE 10 been borne more than ever towards evil;yet that soul ought still totrust inGod, and never tolayaside itsspiritual weapons and exercises, but strenuously toface thefoe;for noone loses inthis battle but to fight and totrust inGod. Henever ceases tohelp His soldiers, although He sometimes suffers them tobewounded. Only fight, foralldepends onthis. There are remedies look toGod and toHis help with confidence; and, when they least expect it,they shall find their enemies dead. CHAPTER necessary inthis conflict, yet are they notallthat isrequired, forifwehad only these weapons weshould lose thevictory and fall headlong into many evils. Therefore to these weshould add athird weapon, which isspiritual exercise. Spiritual exercise relates principally totheunderstanding and tothewill. With regard totheunderstanding, wemust beOFSPIRITUAL EXERCISE onourguard against two faults, which very Ignorance isthefirstofthese ;itdarkens the understanding, andobstructs theentrance oftruth Therefore itclear and bright, sothatyoumay andadorning with holy Light may beobtained intwoways. The firstandmost important means isprayer.

We shall learn, that topardon our enemies and tobenefit them isgreatness of mind, and forms inusaclose resemblance to God ;that todespise the world isanobler course tohave obey forthelove ofGod those farbeneath us, generous great princes ;that ahumble conception ofourselves ismore precious than the highest intellectual attainments; and, that the victory over and mortification ofaslight rising ofone ofthe passions ismore glorious than the conquest of many cities, than theoverthrow ofpowerful and armed forces, than the tothe precipitancy ispresented toyou, view itwith your understanding, and give it mature consideration before you conceive a hatred foritandreject it,ifitiscontrary toyour natural inclinations which isveiled byasemblance ofevil. Whereas, ifthewill isfirstinclined tolove or hate any thing, the understanding afterwards cannot exercise asound judgment upon it; because theaffection, intervening between the object andthemind, prevents ajustview ofthe object ;and theunderstanding, representation, DISCERNMENT 23 therulewhich hasbeen inturn misleading theother, dark ness producing thicker darkness, and error deeper error. Guard yourself with thegreatest care against any irregular affection itstrue nature, and especially bythelight ofgrace and prayer, and with theguidance ofyour spiritual father. And Iwould advise youtoobserve oftime, orsome fault ruin the whole, ashasbeen thecase with many whohave incurred great peril through theperformance of actions inthemselves praiseworthy and most holy.24 against which under standing must beonitsguard iscuriosity; because, when wesuffer ittobefilled with hurt ful, idle, and frivolous thoughts, wedestroy its power ofapprehending that which closely relates donot concern you, though they may beharmless inthemselves. Ever restrain your understanding asmuch as possible, and love tokeep itlow. Let thenews orsmall asthough they were not; and, should they come inyour way, reject them and drive them from you. Even inyour desire toknow heavenly things, preserve asober and humble spirit, caring only toknow Christ Crucified, His Life, and His Death, and whatever Herequires ofyou. Keep other things farfrom you, and inthis way become asdear toHim those whoOFEXERCISING ARIGHT JUDGMENT 25 desire and seek from Him only such things as areconducive tothelove ofHis Divine Good ness, andtothefulfilment ofHisWill. springs from self-love, pride, andthedeceit ofthedevil. Ifyoufollow these counsels you will escape sees that their understanding, that hemay thus master both theone and the other. His intotheir up with thepleasure ofinvestigating such subjects, inwhich they falsely imagine that they are delighting inGod, they may neglect tocleanse their hearts, and toacquire self-knowledge and truemortification. Thus, falling intothesnare of pride, they make anidoloftheir own intellect. Hence, gradually and imperceptibly, they come easily cured, forpride JUDGMENT totheunderstanding, may byobedience torightful authority; hisown opinion man's ?and tothe judgment ofothers, when itasinferior tohisown ?

Then resist without loss oftime this malignant form ofpride, before itpenetrates into your and you shall bewiser than Solomon.OF THE EXERCISE OF THE WILL 2\"] which you must apply totheunderstanding, you must also discipline your will, sothat itmay notbeleftto follow itsown desires, butbeinallthings con formed tothegood pleasure ofGod. And remember, that itisnot enough that you should will and dothose things which are most pleasing toGod; but, beyond this, you must will and dothem, asbeing moved byHim, and with themotive ofsimply pleasing more than inthematter wehave been considering intheprevious chapter, liesthe struggle with ournature, which seeks itself and pleasure inallthings, and most gaze longingly upon them, and crave forthem ; not because wearemoved todothe Will of God and wish only toplease Him, but from a desire for that satisfaction and rest which we J28 OFTHE EXERCISE OFTHE WILL experience when wewill those things which God wills. The more excellent the object iswhich we desire, the more liable weare tobedeceived. Thus, even inthedesire after God Himself, into the snares ofself- love, byhaving aneyetoour own interests and tothe advantages which weexpect from God, rather than toHis Will, Whose pleasure itis that we should love, desire, and obey Him simply forthesake ofHis Glory. Iwillnow tellyou how toavoid this delusion, which would hinder your progress inholiness; and how toget into the habit ofwilling and doing allthings according tothe guidance of the Spirit ofGod, and with the pure motive of honouring and serving Him only, Who should bethe Beginning and End ofallourthoughts and actions. When any thing presents itself as inaccordance with the Will ofGod, donot bring yourself towillit,until you have first lifted upyour thoughts toGod, toascertain whether it isHis Will that you should will it,and whether you will itbecause Hedoes, and with theview ofpleasing Him Alone. Then letyour and drawn by His\u2014bebent upon willing it,because it,and with the sole object ofpleasing and glorifying Him.OF THE EXERCISE OF THE WILL 29 The same course must bepursued inrefusing the things which are contrary toGod's Will. Donotrefuse them tillyou have first fixed the eyeoftheunderstanding upon His Divine Will, Who wills that you should refuse them forthe sake ofpleasing Him. Know, however, that welittle suspect how deceitful and crafty our nature is,which isever secretly seeking self, forweareoften ledtoima gine that our motive istoplease thereverse. Thus itcomes topass, that when wechoose orrefuse orrefusing itinthe hope ofpleasing, orfear ofdispleasing forthis delusion ispurity ofheart, which consists inthis (which isreally the aim ofallthis spiritual combat), namely \u2014the putting offthe old man, and the putting onthenew. Inorder tobewell prepared, seeing you are full ofself, beginning ofevery action, lest there beany admixture ofselfish motives, and free yourself asmuch aspossible from them. Neither choose, nordo,norrefuse any thing, unless you feel yourself moved and drawn tothat course bythe pure and simple Will space of thismotive itself, that, losing sight of theDivine Will, heturns aside and becomes attached tothesatisfaction heexperiences in doing it,and totheadvantage orcredit he gains from ifGod hindrance inhisway, andthework isimpeded bysickness,OFTHE and begins tomurmur atthis oratthat, not tosay, sometimes even against God Himself, \u2014tooclear aproof that he was not wholly seeking the Will ofGod, and that the motive was rotten and corrupt atits core. For every soul which moves asGod moves it, and aims atpleasing Him only, does notwish forthis more than forthat; nor tohave any thing unless wills togive it,nortohave except intheway and forthetime Heappoints : such isequally contented, For ineither case itobtains itspurpose, and itswish isfulfilled, which was nothing else butthegood Therefore keep yourself habitually recollected, and bediligent indirecting allyour actions to this may even through these motives look ultimately tothegood pleasure and Will of God, Who delights not atyour departure into Hell, butatyour entrance into His Kingdom. The dignity and power ofthis motive noman canfully comprehend; asingle action \u2014even the least and most insignificant \u2014done with theview2,2 OF THE EXERCISE OF THE WILL ofpleasing God Alone, and ofglorifying Him, isworth infinitely more (sotospeak) than many actions inthemselves ofthe greatest value and worth, butspringing from other motives. Thus, asingle penny given toapoor man, with the sole object ofpleasing His Divine Majesty, is more acceptable inHis Sight than theentire re nunciation ofallourpossessions, however great they may be,from theattainment oftheBliss ofHeaven, \u2014anobject good, butone which isinthehighest degree desirable. This practice ofdoing every thing with the simple intention ofpleasing God Alone, appears difficult atfirst, butbecomes easy and delightful byuse, and byfrequently fixing our desires on God Himself, and bylonging after Him with thewarm affections ofour hearts, asour only and highest Good \u2014theOne Who deserves that allbeings should seek Him for Himself, and should serve and love Him above allthings. The more seriously and constantly wemedi tate upon the Infinite Excellence ofGod, the more fervent and frequent will these acts ofthe will become; and weshall easily acquire inthis way thehabit SGOOD PLEASURE 33 prayer ;and tomeditate often upon thenumber less blessings, which God, outofpure love, and with nobenefit toHimself, has bestowed, ofGod, call that inmany ways Hehasfirsthonoured and loved thecorruptible price ofsilver and gold, butwith His own Precious Blood, and His most painful and ignominious Death. Consider, too, that every hour, and every moment, He defends you from your enemies, fights foryoubyHisgrace, offers you continually intheSacrament oftheAltar His Dear Son to beyour strength and this atoken oftheinestimable love and regard which34 OFTHE MANY WILLS the Infinite God has foryou?Wecannot, on theone hand, conceive how much value sogreat aLord sets onuspoor creatures, inour base ness and misery; and, ontheother, how much weareindebted toHis High Majesty, Who has done somany and sogreat forus. Forifearthly masters, when they arehonoured even bymen ofpoor and lowly condition, feel bound tohonour them inreturn, how should ourvileness behave itself towards theSovereign Ruler ofthe Universe, byWhom weare so dearly prized and loved ! And, inaddition towhat has been already mentioned, keep ever alively remembrance, that the Divine Majesty isinftnitely worthy tobe honoured and served simply forHimself, and forHis and superior will; and thewill ofthesenses, which wecall the sensual and inferior will, and which sometimes bears the names ofappetite, flesh, sense, and passion: yet, asitisthrough liesthewhole spiritual will midway between Divine Willwhich resolve toamend andtheflesh\u2014toyield ofJesus Christ. which thehigher will sustains from the Divine andsensual wills warring onboth sides ofit,issosharp and violent, that itentails much suffering. Those who areexperienced intheways of virtue orvice donotfeel this, butpursue the course they have entered upon with less diffi culty ;thevirtuous yielding readily their will to theDivine Will, yielding without resistance tothewilloftheflesh. But letnoone suppose itpossible toform true Christian virtues, ought, ingood earnest WILLS thepain ofgiving upallthethings which pleased him, both great and small, and towhich hehad clung with earthly affection. Forthisreason fewreach perfection ;forwhen they have overcome their greater faults with much toil, they will notcontinue todoviolence tothemselves, bybearing thevexation and weari ness countless little wishes and little movements ofthe passions involves. Thus these insignificant enemies are permitted tohave their own way, and soobtain complete mastery over their hearts. All those who, ifthey donottake what belongs toothers, yet cling their own, areofthis should, shun them covet them, and even sometimes byvarious seek togain them. Ifthey keep thefasts ofobligation, they donotmortify their appetite astosuperfluities, nor astothe delicacies which they crave for. Ifthey live chaste lives, yetthey donotabstain from some indulgences which hinder much their union with God and their growth inthespiritual life, and which even tothe holiest persons are dangerous, and areespecially sotothose who fear them least, and therefore should beavoided byalltotheutmost oftheir power.OFTHE MANY WILLS 37 allother good works aredone inalukewarm spirit, aremixed areaccompanied byacertain self-esteem, and toadvance way ofsalvation, but, back, stand into their oldsins ;because they have nolove fortrue virtue, and show little gratitude tothe Lord Who rescued them from the bondage oftheDevil. Moreover, they are tooblind and ignorant toseetheir real danger, whilst they delude themselves with theidea that they areinasafe condition. Here wediscover agreat error, and one so much themore injurious asitistheless guarded against. Many who aspire tothe spiritual life, being rather lovers ofthemselves than ofthat which isneedful (although indeed they know it not), select forthemost part those practices which accord with their own taste, and neglect others which touch tothe quick their natural inclina tions and sensual appetites, toovercome which allreason demands that they should put forth their fullstrength. Therefore, beloved, Iadvise and entreat you tocherish alove forthat forsuch things will victory38 OFACQUIRING HABITS OF VIRTUE over self; \u2014onthis alldepends. That victory will bethemore certain and speedy, themore resolutely you give your heart tothose toils which inholiness inwar ifyou love thetoiland hardship ofthestruggle, rather than the victory and the virtue, you shall thesooner gain toexercise ways, inorder that the Divine Will may inallthings prevail within you. First, whenever you areassaulted and buffeted bytheimpulses ofthe lower nature, you must resist them manfully, sothat thehigher will may notconsent. Secondly, when the assaults have ceased, excite them again, soastohave anopportunity ofovercoming them with greater force and energy. Then challenge them again athirdOFACQUIRING HABITS OF VIRTUE 39 time, soastoaccustom yourself torepulse them with scorn and horror. These two challenges tobattle should bemade Suppose, then, youareattacked byfeelings of impatience. Look well into yourself, and you willdiscover that thehigher ;use thehigher will re peatedly inopposing these heperceives thatweresolutely form the habit ofthe opposite virtue.40 OFACQUIRING HABITS OF VIRTUE And besides this, hewould dexterously lead ustobelieve, that wehave asbrave and exciting anew within you those thoughts which ledto the temptation ofimpatience, until you are conscious ofthefeeling again ;then resist with astronger will than before, and with greater force repress thefeelings. And because, unless wethoroughly hate them, wearestillindanger ofbeing overcome byfresh attacks from our enemies \u2014however them from toplease God \u2014you must them athird and drive them farfrom you, notonly with dislike butwith disdain, picturing them of hatred andabhorrence. Lastly, inorder thatthesoul may beadorned and perfected with habits ofvirtue, you must often make inward actswhich shall bedirectly opposed toyour unruly passions. Thus, ifyou want togain perfect when received toexercise IhaveOFACQUIRING VIRTUE 4I already described, youmust learn further todesire and love theslight you have received, wishing for arepetition ofit,and from the same person ; awaiting and disposing yourself tosuffer still greater insults. These contrary acts are neces sary forour perfection inholiness, asthey And therefore (tocontinue thesame instance) although, onreceiving aninsult we may not consent tothefeelings ofimpatience, but fight against them inthethree ways which have been recommended ;yet, unless we accustom our selves bymany and constant acts ofthe will tolove contempt and rejoice init,weshall never ofimpatience, and wholly choked byit;it will keep usincontinual danger ofarelapse upon every occasion. Therefore, without these contrary acts, thetrue habit ofvirtues can never beacquired. And keep inmind also, these must thesinful formed byrepeated acts ofsin, can only be removed byrepeated acts acounter-habit former are not inalliance with our nature, which is corrupt, butthelatter arealways aided byit. Again, Iwould add toallthat has been said, that, ifthe virtue you are striving toacquire need it,you must perform theoutward acts in conformity with the inward ;as,forexample, speaking gently and lovingly, and, ifpossible, rendering services, tothose who have inany way vexed and thwarted you. And although these acts\u2014both inward andout ward \u2014aredone, orseem unwilling service, yetyou must account failtodothem; because, however weak they may be,they willkeep you strong and secure inthebattle, and make easy before you thepath tovictory. Stand onyour and violent, butalso thegentlest movement ; forthese latter open theway fortheformer, and thus habits ofsinareafterwards generated inus.OF ACQUIRING HABITS 43 Itcomes topass, from thelittle caremen take toroot outoftheir hearts lesser desires, that, after having conquered thestronger cravings of thesame passion, many, when they least expect it,have been assaulted andvanquished bytheir oldenemies more completely and fatally than atfirst.

Butinnoother way, orcourse ofdiscipline \u2014 however such may commend itself taste, yea, OFACQUIRING real notcon sistin(asItold renewing ofman practice ofthe virtues oftheGospel, and the uniting Creator. Depend upon it,that ashabits ofsinare produced bymany and repeated acts ofthe higher will, yielding itself tothe sensual ap petite; so,onthe other hand, ofdifferent virtues from time totime. For asourwill can never become vicious or earthly, however fiercely assaulted orallured by the lower nature, unless itinclines towards or consents tothe temptations; so,onthe other hand, our will, however forcibly drawn and assailed byinspirations and Divine grace, will never become virtuous orbeunited toGod, so long asbyinward, and tobebrought into con formity with His Will.OFTHE thehigher should seem to you powerless against thelower, and itsother enemies, because you donotfeel that your will iseffectually setagainst them, yet stand firm and donot leave offfighting; foryou must re gard yourself asvictorious, until you can clearly seethat you have given way. For since the higher will can actwithout the lower, sothehigher can never becompelled by thelower toyield, however hot the assaults of thelatter may be. God has, intruth, given tothe will such liberty and such power, that, ifallthe senses, allevilspirits, and alltheworld were toconspire together, and with their combined strength to assault and oppress it,thewill could stillinspite ofthem will orwill not whatever itliked with perfect freedom, and could assert itself when itliked, and asoften as,foraslong as,inwhat manner, and forwhatever end, best pleased it. And ifthese enemies should ever attack you and press you with such violence asalmost to stifle your will, soastoleave you, asitwere,46 OFTHE leaping upon when heisunable tothrust can donothing. Then, putting your trust inGod Who candoallthings, strike a blow atthepassion which attacks you, and say \u2014\"Help me,OLord; help me,Jesus, Mary's iftheenemy gives you time forit,call inyour understanding toaidyour will, and considerations impart tothewillfresh andspirit against theenemy. Thus, forexample, you will proceed toencourage itbyOF THE HIGHER AND LOWER WILLS 47 considering some points, such asthe follow ing:\u2014 First, consider, that ifyou have brought upon yourself theevil under which you are suffering, you deserve tobear it;for,insuch acase, every rule ofjustice requires you tobear patiently the punishment which you have yourself been the means ofinflicting. Secondly, ifyou arenottoblame inthis par ticular matter, think that there aremany faults which you have committed, forwhich you have received nochastisement from God, norhave you punished yourself forthem asyou ought. And seeing that the Divine mercy has changed the punishment ofthese faults, which should have been eternal, oratleast should last forages in another world, into this light affliction, ought you nottoreceive itwillingly, oreven thankfully ? Thirdly, ifthethought should come that the penance isalong one incomparison with the offence against the Divine Majesty \u2014athought which noone can ever lawfully indulge \u2014you must remember, that itisonly through thestrait gate ofmuch tribulation that any can enter into theKingdom ofHeaven. Fourthly, think that were itpossible toenter by aneasier the lawoflove would not allow todream ofdoing so,seeing that the Son ofGod, with allHis friends and His members, ---f48 OF THE MANNER OFFIGHTING reached that Kingdom bytheroad ofthorns and crosses. Fifthly, the chief thought upon which your mind should dwell inthis, and inallother temptations, istheWill ofyour God, Who, forthe love Hehasforyou, takes unspeakable delight in every actofholiness and mortification which you, asHis faithful and devoted soldier, inreturn forHislove toyou. And convinced ofthis, that themore unreasonable itself thetrouble is,and the more shameful on account oftheperson from whom itcomes and therefore toyou themore vexatious if,inthings disordered inthem selves and especially grievous toyou, you can approve and love His Divine Will and Provi dence, bywhich every event \u2014however irregular itmay seem per fect have seen already, how you must fight ifyou would conquer self, and adorn yourself with virtues.OF THE MANNER OFFIGHTING 49 Know, also, that togain aquicker and easier conquest over your enemies, itisexpedient, nay, necessary, that theconflict should becarried on daily, and especially the conflict with self-love ; learn toreceive, therefore, asdear friends, all theslights and which theworld canheap upon you. From ourwant ofattention tothis strife, and from making itoftoolittle account, itfrequently happens, asIhave said before, that ourvictories arefewand imperfect, are hardly won, and are notlasting. Further, Iwarn you that you must fight with great steadfastness ofpurpose. And this gift you will easily gain, ifyou seek itby prayer ;and if,when ontheone hand you take into account the endless hatred and rage of your enemies, and the vast number oftheir squadrons and armies :you, ontheother hand, consider how infinitely greater isthe Goodness ofGod, and thelove with which He loves you, and how much mightier too aretheAngels of Heaven, and the prayers oftheSaints, who are fighting onourside. Animated bythese reflections, how many, many poor weak women have resisted and over come allthepower and wisdom oftheworld, all theassaults oftheflesh, and allthefury ofHell ! Therefore, you OF THE MANNER OFFIGHTING though attimes theassaults ofyour enemy seem perpetually renewed, and though they threaten tolastallyour lifetime, and though certain falls onevery side menace you;for,remember, \u2014 besides what has been already said\u2014that the whole strength andwisdom tobeovercome, but HeHimself will fight foryou, and give your enemies into your hand, inHis own good time ;and this toyour greater reward, though Hekeep you waiting even tothelastday of your life. Allyou have todoistofight valiantly, and never tothrow down your arms, norflee, how ever many wounds youmay have sustained. Ftnally, tospur yourself ontofight coura geously, you this there isnoescape; fornottofight isall onewith being taken prisoner orslain. Besides, ofourenemies are such, that there isnopossibility ofanytruce mind, inthe ofbattle, hemmed inbyenemies, and under theabsolute necessity offighting, orperishing forever. Within this view represent toyourself, your enemy \u2014the evil inclination which you have sworn torenounce, facing you ontheone side, and armed soastobeable towound and kill you;and, ontheright hand, seeyour victorious Leader, Jesus Christ, with Hismost holy Mother, the Virgin Mary, and her beloved husband, Joseph, and countless hosts ofAngels and Saints, especially St.Michael the Archangel ; onthelefthand, behold theDevil from beneath, with unto you, \"You have to daytofight against thisenemy and against others too. Let not your heart sink, and donot lose courage ;nor yield from fear oronany other account, for our Lord, your Captain, stands52 OF THE SOLDIER OFCHRIST beside you, with allHis glorious hosts with Him ;and He will fight for you against all your enemies, and will not permit them to prevail against you either byforce oroppres sion. Only stand firm, and doviolence toyourself, and donot shrink from the pain which such a discipline will cost you. Cry unceasingly from thedepths ofyour heart, and call upon theLord, asking also and inexperienced inthe strife, and your enemies appear tobe many and powerful, yet much more isthe strength which He, Who made and redeemed you, will give you than that which they possess ; and beyond allmeasure and comparison isyour God mightier than they, and His Will foryour salvation stronger than thewill ofyour enemies foryour destruction. Fight therefore, and donot spare yourself thepain; forfrom the toil inovercoming and doing violence toyour evil inclinations, and from the suffering which thewar against sinful habits necessitates, you shall gain the victory, and win the exceeding great reward, and therewith purchase foryourself the Kingdom of Heaven, and theeverlasting union ofyour soul with God.\"OF THE SOLDIER OFCHRIST taking ofselfand trust inGod, with prayer and spiritual exercises; with these arms challenge this foe,that is,this in clination, whatever itmay be,which, according totheorder down, you have resolved now byopen resistance, deadly blows, inorder toplease your Lord, Who, with His whole Church Triumphant, is looking onand watching thecombat. Itell you again, that you must not grow weary inthe conflict, but must ever bear in mind that itisthebounden duty ofalltoserve and please God; that thenecessity offighting is absolute, and escape impossible without wounds ordeath. Itellyou, also, that if,asadeserter you were toflyfrom God, and give yourself to thedelights oftheworld and ofthe flesh, you would still, inspite ofyourself, beforced to labour inthesweat ofyour brow against many and many acontradiction which would pierce your heart with deadly anguish. Consider, then, what madness itwould beto incur allthis toil and pain \u2014which only lead togreater toil and pain with endless death \u2014 simply toavoid that which will soon beover, and which would bring ustoalifeeternal and54 OF THE CONFLICT WITH OUR PASSIONS infinitely blessed everlasting enjoyment ofourGod. CHAPTER The best order forproceeding inthis battle against your enemies and your evil inclinations isasfollows :\u2014 Having diligently examined your heart, and searched into the different thoughts and affec tions which encompass it,and having discovered bywhat passion itismost and governed; then against thisfirst, direct your attack. Ifithappens that, meanwhile, you are assailed byother enemies, you must turn against theone which atthemoment threatens you and most closely attacks you, and then return at once tothe'chief point ofconflict.OFSUDDEN RISINGS OF toovereome attacks, whether ofinjuries or adverse occurrences ;inorder it,your plan will betoanticipate such attacks, and de siretobear them over and over again, and thus dispose yourself foractually receiving them. The way toforestall them isthis,\u2014having considered the bent ofyour passions, consider also theplaces where, andthepersons with whom, you are likely tobethrown; you may easily thus conjecture what may probably happen. And should any other vexatious circumstance arise, which you had not foreseen, inaddition tothe general help which aprepared mind gives, even tomeet evils beyond those for which itwas prepared, you may with advan tage avail yourself ofthe following mode of meeting it:\u2014 Assoon asyou first feel the blow ofthis unexpected injury ortrial, beonyour guard at once, and make theeffort toliftupyour mind toGod, contemplating His unspeakable good ness and love toyou, insending you this trial in56 OFSUDDEN RISINGS OF THE order that you, bearing itout oflove forHim, may bethemore purified, and may bebrought near and united toHim. And, realising how greatly itpleases Him that you should suffer this, turn toyourself and say, \"Ah, why soreluctant tobear this cross, which islaid upon younotbythisorthat inHeaven?\" Then turn to thecross, embrace itwith thefullest resignation and joy, and say, \"O cross, formed byDivine Providence before Iwas born !Ocross, now tothee, that Imay give myself toHim Who, dying upon thee, hath redeemed me!\" And if,atthe onset, the passion soprevail over you, that you cannot liftupyour heart to God, butremain wounded, strive even then to doasatthe beginning, and tofight asifyou had notreceived awound. The most effectual remedy, however, against these sudden impulses, istocut out without delay thecause from which they spring. Thus, ifyou find out that your affection for any thing issogreat, that, whenever itispre sented toyou, you fall into asudden agitation ofmind, 57 butbyaperson, forwhom you have such an aversion that every little action annoys and irritates you, the remedy then is,toforce your self toincline your will tolove him and to regard him, not only because heisacreature like yourself, formed bythe Almighty Hand, and formed anew bythesame Divine Blood, but also, because heaffords you anopportunity, if you will accept it,ofbecoming like unto your Lord, Who was loving and kind unto all.

Presume notonyour own strength, ifyou are free, and have been forvery many years free, from thetemptations oftheflesh ;forthis thewounds itinflicts. And often there ismore tobefeared \u2014as experience has often shown, and shows every day\u2014where intercourse seems perfectly legi timate, aswith relations, orinthedischarge of duties, orwith persons virtues ought andunguarded intercourse, instilling itself, until itpenetrates into thevery depths of the soul, and darkens the reason more and more, until things which aremost dangerous are regarded asofnoaccount; such asloving looks, words great difficulty overcome.OFRESISTING THE LUSTS OFTHE good purpose, when expect it,will so attack you, that overtaken, made prisoner, and slain.

For ifyou areready tojudge and despise another, God willcorrect youtoyour cost, and will permit you tofallinto thesame fault, that you may beconvinced ofyour pride such ahumiliation, you may findtheremedy forboth these sins. And, even ifyou donotfallinto this sin, remember, that, unless youputaway thissinof rash judgment, your state willstill beonetobe much concerned about. Fifthly and lastly, take heed, lest, when you arefavoured with some spiritual sweetness and delight, youfallinto thesnare ofacertain vain complacency, andimagine yourself tobesome thing, and thatyour enemies arenolonger able toattack you, because you entertain towards them such afeeling ofdisgust, hatred, and loathing. Ifyouareputoffyour guard inthis thetime Imean such things ascuriosity oftheeyes and ears, indulgence infinedress, habits, and conversations which stir upthis vice. The remedies insuch cases aremodesty and decency, guard oftheeyes and ears from whatOFRESISTING THE LUSTS OF THE FLESH 6I may stirupthis evil, and (asIhave said already) flight. The inward causes are, either vigour ofbody, orimaginations ofthemind which proceed hard measures; butthese must beun dertaken with discretion and under obedience. Unholy thoughts, from whatever source they arise, must beremedied asfollows :\u2014 First, byconstant occupation bymeditation. Let prayer bemade inthefollowing way :\u2014 When you are first slightly conscious, Ido not sayoftheevil thoughts themselves, but of those which lead uptothem, atonce flyin spirit toyour Crucified Lord, and say, times, clasping the Cross onwhich your Lord hangs, and kissing again and again theWounds ofHis Sacred Feet, saylovingly, \u2014\"Obeautiful Wounds, chaste Wounds, holy Wounds, wound now my heart, miserable and impure asitis, and free itfrom allthat in Idonotrecommend certain asthevileness ofthis vice, itsinsatiable- ness, theloathing and remorse which follow upon it,theperil and loss ofgoods, life, honour, and allsuch things. For this issofarfrom being a sovereign remedy against such temptations, that itmay prove hurtful rather than otherwise ;for if,onthe one hand, the mind dispels these thoughts, ontheother, itaffords theopportunity and exposes ustothedanger oftaking consenting tothedelight. Therefore thesure remedy isflight inallthese cases, both from the thoughts themselves, and from every thing \u2014however contrary tothem \u2014which may bring them tothemind again. theLife be fore molest you more than ever\u2014asisfrequently thecase \u2014donot therefore despond, nor leave offyour meditation, neither turn your attention tothese thoughts with aview toresisting them, but pursue itwith allpossible ofthese thoughts, which LUSTS OFTHE FLESH 63 belong toyou. There isnobetter plan of resisting them than this, however frequently these assaults may come. You may finish your meditation with this, or some similar request, \u2014\"Deliver me, Omy Creator and Redeemer, from my enemies, to the honour ofThy Passion and ofThy un speakable Goodness;\" and then give nofurther thought tothe sin, forthe bare remembrance ofitisnotwithout danger. Never, atany time, stay todispute with such temptations, whether you have consented or not; forthis isadevice oftheDevil, who seeks, under theguise ofagood and render you distrustful hopes, bykeeping your attention onsuch ques tions, toplunge you into some wrong pleasure. Therefore, inthis temptation (when you are notclear astowhether you have consented or not) itwill besufficient toconfess the whole as briefly aspossible toyour spiritual father, and then torest satisfied with hisopinion upon the matter, without thinking about itmore. Be careful, however, that you laybare before him every thought, and donotlethuman respect or shame hinder you from doing so. For ifinallcases weneed the virtue of humility inorder toovercome our enemies, we must exercise itinthis more than inany other;64 OF OVERCOMING SLOTH this vice being, asarule, the punishment of pride. 3.When thetemptation has gone, you must actinthis way :\u2014However free, and however secure you fancy yourself tobefrom alldanger, yetkeep your mind faraway from those subjects which may have occasioned thetemptation, even should you feel aninducement todootherwise forthe sake ofsome good and virtuous end. For this isadevice ofour corrupt nature, and asnare ofour subtle enemy, who himself into anangel draw usinto thedarkness. CHAPTER XX. SDftlietHap toosereome %lotlj. THAT you may not fall into the miserable bondage ofsloth, which notonly hinders allspiritual progress, butalso delivers you into thehands ofyour enemies, you must avoid all curiosity and earthly attachment, and every occu pation which does notbelong toyour state oflife. You must then exert yourself toobey every good inspiration from above, and every com mand ofthose who are over you; doing every thing atthetime and inthemanner which they approve of.OFOVERCOMING SLOTH Never delay, even foraninstant; forthat first indulgence will bring another initstrain, and then athird, and then others after it;and finally thesenses will yield more easily than at the beginning, being already allured and capti vated bythe pleasure which they have is,that, when itistoo late webegin toact, orneglect altogether habit ofsloth isformed, which intime upon us,and brings us into such astate, that atthevery instant, when wearebound hand and foot with thechains of sloth, wevainly purpose tobemore diligent and more active atanother time, obliged with blushes toown toourselves our present exces sive indolence. vain and unfounded are itspurposes ofdoing diligently and promptly, at some future day, that which should bedone at once, butwhich iseither voluntarily leftundone, ordeferred inorder todoitas perfectly aspossible, doitatthe very time which the and quality ofthe work de66 OF OVERCOMING SLOTH mand, and with allthe diligence which be fitsit. For that isnot diligence, but avery subtle form ofsloth, which leads ustodoour work before itstime, and caring whether well wemay then quietly give ourselves uptothe enjoyment ofasluggish rest, upon which our thoughts were bent, when we were hurrying through ourtask. This great evil proceeds from the want of duly considering the value ofagood work, when done atthe right time, and with ade termination toovercome the toil and difficulty which thesinofsloth puts intheway ofnewly- enlisted soldiers. You must often, therefore, call tomind, that one ejaculation toGod, one single bending ofthe honour, isworth more than allthe treasures ofglorious victory from theHeavenly Kingdom. And consider also, onthe other hand, that from theslothful, God bylittle and little with draws thegraces which Hehad bestowed upon them; whilst tothe diligent He gives more abundant graces, and permits them atlast to enter into His joy.OFOVERCOMING SLOTH 67 Astothetoiland hardship, ifyou feel atfirst unable boldly toface it,hide them from you, that they may not seem soformidable assloth would represent them. The work you have before you, perhaps, isto gain some virtue bymany repeated acts ofit, and with many days' toil; and theenemies you have toencounter seem numerous and powerful. Begin, then, these acts, asifyou had butfewto make, and butashort time toendure the con flict. Fight against one enemy atatime, asif there were nomore toberesisted; and fight than allwho areagainst you. Bythis means will gradually lose ground, and give place bydegrees tothe entrance of theopposite virtue. The same plan Ifone hour isallotted forprayer, and tosloth upon itwith the intention ofspending ten minutes ;then, when that time has passed, take ten minutes more ;and soyou will pass easily through the remainder, until thewhole hour isspent. But if,after tenortwenty when itisyour duty tounder take works which seem tosloth interminable and tedious, and which, therefore, you cannot view without vexation ofmind ;begin, neverthe less, courageously and calmly with one, asifit were the only one you had todo;and when, having confined your attention tothat, you have finished it,then goonwith the next ;and in this way, you will getthrough thewhole ofthem with far less exertion than your slothfulness could have conceived tobepossible. But ifyou donot follow this plan, and face with courage thetoiland hardship which liein your way, the vice ofsloth will sogain the mastery over you, that you will be always harassed and vexed, notonly bythepresent toil and struggle, which ever accompany the first practice ofvirtue, but also bythe sight ofthat which isafar off. You will liveindread ofbeing tried and assailed byenemies, orofseeing some one impose afresh burden onyour shoulders ; sothat, even intimes ofpeace, you will befull ofapprehension. Further, remember, beloved, that this vice of sloth, with itssecret poison, willnotonly gradu ally killtheearly and tender roots which would ultimately have produced habits ofvirtue, but also habits ofvirtue which are already formed. Itwill, like the worm inthe wood, insensiblyOF OVERCOMING SLOTH 69 eataway and destroy the very marrow ofthe spiritual life. Itisbythis means the Devil spreads hisnets and traps inthe way ofallof us,butespecially ofthose who seek tobecome spiritual. Watch, therefore, with prayer, and labour with diligence, and delay not toweave the web of your wedding-garment, foryou should befound clothed initwhen theBridegroom comes. Remember every day, that He Who gives you themorning does notpromise the evening, and when Hegives you the evening, does not promise thenext morning. Spend, then, every moment ofthe passing hour inaway which ispleasing toGod, asifit were your last, and somuch themore carefully, seeing that forevery moment you must give the strictest account. Finally, Iadvise you toconsider that day as lost, inwhich (though you may have transacted much business init)you have neither gained a victory over some sinful inclination, orform of self-will, northanked theLord forallHis bene fits, and above allfor His Sorrowful Passion endured for you, and for His Fatherly and sweet chastisements, when He has made you worthy toreceive from Him the inestimable treasure ofsome trial.JO OF THE GUARD OF THE OUTWARD cessary fortheright control and guard ofouroutward senses. may beregarded asthecaptain ofour corrupt nature, ismadly bent upon seeking pleasures and satisfaction ;and, being incapable ofitself of obtaining them, itmakes useofthesenses asits soldiers, and asnatural instruments forlaying hold oftheir the images ofwhich it takes, appropriates, and impresses onthe mind. From this asensation ofpleasure arises, which, bymeans ofthe close connexion between the soul and the flesh, spreads itself through all the sensual part ofour nature, and thus soul and body arepossessed ;nor toemploy them merely forthe sake ofpleasure, without any outhaving inview either usefulness ornecessity.

This may be thus done :\u2014 When anobject ispresented toany one of your outward senses, separate inthought the spirit and the material substance, and reflect that ofitself itpossesses none ofthose qualities which your senses attribute toit,but that allis the work ofGod, Who byHis Invisible Spirit endows itwith the being, beauty, goodness, or charm whatever itbewhich belongs toit.Then rejoice that your Lord Alone isthe Cause and Principle ofsuch great and varied perfections, and that inHimself they areallcontained in thehighest degree youdiscover yourself tobeabsorbed inthe act ofadmiring some noble object, let your thoughts bring the creature down toits own nothingness, and letyour mind's eye gaze upon thegreat Creator therein present, Who made ittobewhat itis;and, delighting in Him only, say\u2014\"ODivine Essence, above all things tobedesired, what joyitistothink that72 OF THE GUARD OF THE OUTWARD SENSES Thou Alone artthe Infinite Principle ofevery created being.\" you behold thetrees, theplants, and things ofthat kind, you will per ceive that their life does not flow from them selves, but from the Invisible Spirit, Which Alone gives them life.

Many objects, then, will bring particularly these Holy Mysteries before your mind's eye; such asweapons, cords, scourges, pillars, thorns, reeds, nails, hammers, and other instruments of His Passion. The sight ofahovel may recall toourmemory thestable and manger ofour Lord. Rain may remind usofthat rain ofDivine Blood which watered the ground, falling from His Sacred Body inthe Garden. Rocks will represent to usthose which were split asunder atHis Death ; theearth will bring toremembrance theearth quake which then took place; thesun, thedark ness which obscured it,and the sight ofwater will speak tousofthat stream which flowed forth from His most Sacred Side. Other things may beused inasimilar manner. Whenever you taste wine, orother drink, think ofthevinegar and gall which was given toyour Lord.76 OFREGULATING OUR SENSES Ifyou enjoy asweet perfume, think ofthe stench from the dead bodies which He smelt onCalvary. Whilst dressing, have inmind how the Eter nal Word clothed Himself with human flesh, that He might clothe you with His Divinity.

Ileave allthis, how ever, thesenses \u2014bewatchful that, inallthe occurrences of your life, whatever they may be, you are not moved ordrawn, either bylove orhatred ofthem,OFRULING THE TONGUE 83 butonly bythe Will ofGod, embracing what God wills you toembrace, and hating what God wills you tohate. And observe, that these different rules for governing thesenses arenotgiven toyouthat you should bealways thinking about them ;foryour mind should befixed onyour Lord continually, Who wills that, byfrequently making acts of the contrary virtues, and byresistance, you should conquer your enemies and subdue your evil passions. Ihave simply given you these directions tohelp you when you stand inneed ofthem. For you must know that there islittle fruit in the multiplicity ofspiritual practices, however excellent they may beinthemselves. They often because wearealltooin clined toletitrunonand discourse upon things which aremost agreeable tooursenses. Itisusually pride which isattheroot of much speaking. We persuade ourselves that84 OFRULING THE TONGUE weknow agreat inneed ofour instruction. To express inafewwords arise speaking isanimpossibility. Talkativeness continue itsthoughtless utterances.

Beready tospeak ofGod, and especially of His Love and Goodness, butwith guardedness, lestyou fall into some error concerning Him ; and rather delight tohear others speak ofHim, treasuring uptheir words inyour inmost heart. Let the sound ofmSn's words strike only upon your ear, and letyour heart belifted upto God ;and, tothem, still forget nottoraise your eyes thoughtfully towards Heaven, where God dwells, and contemplate His loftiness, asHe deigns toregard your vileness. Whatever comes into your mind foryou to speak, ponder over itwell before you utter it,for youwilldiscover that much which you were going tosayhad better remain unspoken. Indeed Igo further, and assure you, that notafew ofthose things, which youhave after consideration spoken, would have been better ifthey had been con signed tosilence ;and thetruth ofthis you will perceive, if,when the occasion forspeaking is past, you reflect upon what you have said. Silence, beloved, isasafe stronghold inthe spiritual battle, and learn think often upon theevils and dangers oftalk ativeness, and the great advantages ofsilence. Love this virtue ;and from time totime (in order togain thehabit ofit)keep silence even when you might lawfully speak, provided no prejudice arise from ittoyour neighbour orto yourself. And tokeep aloof from conversation will be the more helpful, because instead ofmen, you will have foryour companions the Angels, the Saints, and God Himself. .Finally, give yourself tothe thought ofthe conflict inwhich you are engaged, that, seeing how much lies before you, you may the more easily refrain from overmuch ALL OFMIND 87 thing which ought torob usofit,oreven dis turb it. Wehave just cause togrieve over our sins, but this sorrow should becalm, aswehave already shown inmore than one place. And so oursorrow forthesins ofallothers should bea tranquil sorrow, ofcharity, and lamenting, atleast inwardly, over their offences. Astoother sad and distressing events, as illness, bodily injuries, death ofnearest relatives, pestilences, wars, fires, orsuch like misfortunes, which arepainful tonature and shunned bythe world, but opportunities ofvirtue Himself views them with approbation ;and ifwewould only follow His Will, then weshould pass through allthe troubles and vexations ofthis life with acalm and peaceful spirit. And know, asacertainty, that allanxiety of mind isdispleasing inHis Divine Sight, what ever may bethecause ofit,foritisnever free from imperfection, and always springs from some evil root ofself-love. Keep therefore asentinel always on the watch, who shall give the alarm assoon ashe88 OFLAYING ASIDE ALL evils, andothers arenotreally evils, though outwardly ofmuch oftheHoly Spirit, Who the guise ofafriend, tries todeprive usofit,by stirring upsundry desires within uswhich pre sent themselves theappearance ofgood ; buttheir deceptive nature may ANXIETY OFMIND 89 sire, donotadmit itinto your heart, until you have first, free from allself-seeking and self-will, laid itbefore God ;and, confessing your own ignorance and blindness about it,have earnestly besought Him toshow you, whether thedesire comes from Him, orfrom your adversary. And, ifpossible, obtain also the judgment ofyour spiritual father inthis matter. Moreover, even ifthedesire does come from God, yet be careful, before you follow it, torestrain allimpetuosity; because the work which isentered upon inamortified spirit, will befarmore acceptable toHim, than that which isundertaken with natural eagerness. And often themortification ismore pleasing inHis sight than thework itself. Thus, rejecting alldesires not good, and not acting upon the good ones until you have first curbed your natural impulses, you will beena bled topossess the fortress ofyour heart in peace and safety. Ifyou would keep itinperfect peace, you must take care also toguard and defend itfrom certain stings ofconscience and feelings of remorse, which are sometimes from the Devil, although, asthey accuse usofsome moral failure, they seem tocome from God. Bytheir fruits you shall know their source. Ifthey humble you, ifthey make you diligent ingood90 OFLAYING ASIDE ALL ANXIETY OFMIND works, ifthey donotrobyou ofyour trust in God, then may you thankfully receive them as from God. But ifthey occasion anxiety, and render you fearful, doubtful, slothful, and back ward inwell-doing, beassured that they you com monly from theapproach ofadverse events. In order todefend ourselves against this form of attack, there aretwo things forustodo:\u2014one istoconsider and find out what ischiefly hindered bythese events, our spiritual life, or ourself-love and self-will. For ifthey wound ourself-will and self-love (our first and greatest foe) they must not becalled adverse, but be regarded asspecial favours and aids from the Most High God, and therefore bereceived with ajoyful and athankful heart. And ifthey areadverse tothe spiritual life, you must not even then suffer your peace of mind tobedestroyed, asIwill show inthe following chapter.

Then say:\u2014\"And noteven here, Lord, notheld meback !\" After this, render Him greater thanks and love than ever, wondering atthe greatness ofHis clemency inextending toyou His right Hand tosave you from another fall, when you had just offended Him. Lastly, say, with fullconfidence inHis Infinite Mercy :\u2014\"Forgive me, OLord, according to92 OF WOUNDS Thy Mercy ;letmenever depart from Thee nor beseparated from Thee, andsuffer menever to offend Thee anymore.\" When this hasbeen done, donotsitdown toconsider whether God haspardoned you or not;forthisisOnly pride, anxiety, restlessness, waste oftime, and, colour Butcommit your selffreely into times many leading ustorelinquish it,andisoften successful through ourcarelessness andtoolittle watchful ness over ourselves.

When youhave quieted your mind with these and similar reflections, think once more upon your fault, doing asIhave already bidden you. Again, atthetimes ofsacramental confession (and often toresort tothis) look again atyour falls, andwith renewed sorrow and displeasure forhaving offended God, and with aresolve never tooffend Him more, open them with allsimplicity YOU must know, beloved, that the Devil seeks nothing but ourruin, and that he does notusethesame plan ofassault with all.

The first reason is,asabove \u2014which98 OFFRUITLESS RESOLUTIONS isthe source ofthis delusion and blindness \u2014 hinders usfrom discovering this. The light which discloses theevil and themedicine which cures it,both come from the goodness ustofallthat Hemay lead usfrom trust inself totrust Alone, toself-knowledge. Your resolutions, therefore, tobeeffectual, must befirmly made ;and this they cannot be, unless they arefreed from alltrust inself, and arehumbly based upon trust inGod. second reason is,that when wemake our resolutions, wedwell onthe beauty and value ofvirtue, and these draw outourwill, frail and slack asitis;but when wecome toface the difficulties which must besurmounted before thevirtue can beattained, ourwill, being weak and inexperienced, fails, and shrinks back from theeffort. Accustom yourself, therefore, tolove the difficulties which accompany the attainment of virtues, even more than thevirtues themselves ; and usethese difficulties, now alittle and now much, soastostrengthen your will, ifyou really desire toacquire these virtues. Know also, that the more generously you embrace and value these difficulties, the more speedy and complete shall beyour victory over yourself and your enemies.OFGOING ON TOPERFECTION 99 theDivine Will, butourown interest. This isoften the case with resolutions which weform intimes ofspiritual joy trial, when toavoid this danger, beintimes of spiritual delight very cautious and humble in your resolutions, and especially astopromises and vows. And intrial, letyour resolutions be tobear your patiently, according tothe Will ofGod, and toexalt it,refusing allearthly and sometimes even heavenly consolation. Let your one desire and your one prayer be,that God would enable you tobear alladversity without marring the virtue ofpatience, and without any thing that may displease your Lord. CHAPTER XXX. ffift\\eDelusion ofrhope tolio imagine that r^ep sre going ontoPerfeetion.

And because ourlower tothem, therefore dowepoor creatures flatter ourselves, who endure agonies patiently. Toavoid thissnare, resolve tofight against those enemies who areclose athand, and are really attacking you. You will inthis way discover whether your resolutions aretrue or deceptive, strong orfrail; andyouwilltravel on towards who hence todoso,Ido howOF THE DEVIL'S DECEITS ever, make resolutions beforehand, that you may then befound prepared and strong. Let not your resolutions beestimated by their effects, even though you should have long and rightly exercised yourself invirtue, but be humble astothem, and distrust yourself and your own weakness ;and, putting your trust in God, with frequent prayers, flytoHim forsuc cour andprotection from dangers, and especially from the danger ofthe very least presumption and self-confidence. But inthecase ofslight asIhave mentioned, istoexcite within us, when illness allthewhile with apatient will. Our cunning adversary, knowing that thesick man may thus attain tothehabit ofpatience, suggests atonce tohimhow much good hemight have done under different circumstances, and per suades himthatinhealth hewould have served God, andhave benefited himself andothers, to agreater extent. Having excited these thoughts within him, hegoes onincreasing them by degrees, tillatlasthemakes himrestless the sick toperform greater works, leaving only thebare desire tobecured ofhissickness ;and then, andresist thisOF THE DEVIL'S DECEITS 103 snare. Bevery careful not toallow, when in this state oftrial, any desires orprojects which you cannot atonce carry into effect, and which onthat account arelikely todisturb you. Inthis case resign yourself with allpatience, humility, and resignation totheconviction that your desires may after allnothave theeffect which you supposed, inasmuch asyou areweaker and more unstable than you thought yourself tobe. Orelse think that perhaps God, inHis secret counsels, orforyour unworthiness, does not intend you todothis good work, but rather in tends you topatiently humble and abase yourself under theloving and mighty hand ofHis Will. Inlike manner, when your spiritual father hinders you, orsome other cause, from such fre quent attendance atyour tobevexed and disturbed onthat account, but give upentirely your own mind, and beclothed with thegood pleasure of your Lord, and say\u2014\"If Isee thatmyLord thus makes known tomemy un worthiness, and therefore Iwill praise and bless His Name forever.

And in this liesthat true devotion and service which God requires ofus. Icaution you, further, lestyougrow impatient under trials, from whatsoever source they spring, that, inusing thelawful means which God's servants arewont toresort Divine Majesty bythis means tofreeusfrom ourtroubles. From any ifthething didnotturn outaccording toyour mind and desire, you would easily grow im patient, oryour patience would have some de fect about it,and notbewholly pleasing to God, andwould beoflittle worth.

This isaclear proof that the root of such men's sorrow isnottheir concern forothers, orforany thing else, but their dislike tohave their own will thwarted. Therefore, inorder toescape this and other errors, bear with patience every trouble and sorrow, asIhave told you, from whatever cause itmay spring.

Itis clear, then, that you have noground inthis natural being, viewed byitself alone, either for ofyourself, orforwishing others tothink ofyou.

If,then, you wish that this knowledge ofyour sinfulness and vileness may protect you from your enemies, and make you dear toGod, you must not only strive todespise yourself, as unworthy and stooping, whenever anopportunity offers, to dothat which others regard with contempt. And, lest you should bedeterred from this wholesome exercise, paynoaccount tothejudg ment which others may form ofyou, butgoon with what you aredoing, with thesimple view of your own self-abasement anddiscipline; beware, however, ofthat presumptuous spirit and subtle pride, which oftentimes, under some specious pre text, causes ustodisregard theopinions ofothers.

For when you have gained these virtues, you will have nodifficulty inacquiring the rest, as occasion offers ;and occasions willpresent them selves, inasmuch asallthe virtues are sointer linked onewith another, that you cannot possess one perfectly without having alltherest already, asitwere, onthethreshold ofyour heart. Secondly, never set afixed attainment ofvirtues, nor saythat you will gain116 OFOVERCOMING OUR insomany days, weeks, oryears ;but, as aninfant oranewly-enlisted soldier, fight your way, andpush forward towards thesummit of perfection. Donotever believe thatyouhave perfectly gained thevirtue, andthus that you need pay little attention to theoccasions which may call you tonew acts ofthevirtue, ortoslight failures init. Therefore so asnottomiss theleast opportunity ofexercising avirtue. Embrace every occasion which may lead toit,and especially those which excel indifficulty, because acts which aremost diffi cult tobeperformed arethose which most quickly and thoroughly establish the habit; therefore love those who offer you such oppor tunities. Butfleethose only, andthatwith rapid step, with allhaste anddiligence, which may lead to temptations oftheflesh. Thirdly, beprudent and discreet concerning those exercises which may prove injurious to your bodily health, such asself-chastisement with disciplines, haircloth, fastings, vigils, mediOF OVERCOMING OUR EVIL PASSIONS 117 tations, andthelike;forthese practices must bediscreetly and slowly acquired, asweshall presently show.

Fifthly, bethefoeofallearthly pleasures and gratifications, andinthiswayyouwillweaken the power aparticular indulgence, andontheother attach yourself tosome earthly delight (though it amount only toavenial fault), hard willbethe battle, and bloody, and the victory rare and very uncertain. Therefore bear inmind those divine itwell;soshall certain youareinyour Lord's from allgraces and allvictories ofperfection, limits tohisprogress, still there are some forms ofspiritual fervour which need to bechecked with acertain discretion, lest, being ardently embraced atfirst, they should besoon exhausted, and thus desert usinthe middle of ourcourse. Therefore, besides what has been said about moderation inexternal exercises, we must also learn, that even interior virtues had better beacquired bydegrees, and step bystep; forinthis way that which issmall soon becomes great and abiding. Thus, forexample, weshould notasarule practise patience inthehigh degree, which consists desiring them, before ofvirtue ismore easily OF VIRTUES rooted inthesoul. Ifyouarestriving toacquire one particular virtue, you remember ;your mind too andearnestly inthepursuit of it,than ifitwere occupied with many virtues at once. And with thisuniform exercise, theactswhich concern onesingle virtue areperformed with less they make adeeper impression onus,theseatofthe heart being already prepared and disposed for receiving those which arenewly produced, having already made room forsimilar actsbefore. These reasons have thegreater force, asitis quite certain thatevery one who practises him selfinone virtue atthesame time learns the exercise oftherest;and thus, through thein separable bond which exists between them, when onevirtue grows therestincrease with it, asrays proceeding from one and the same Divine Light.OF THE MEANS OFACQUIRING weneed alarge and generous mind ;awill, neither unstable norre miss, but resolute and strong, with the certain persuasion that many hindrances and trials have tobeovercome. There are, moreover, particular inclinations and affections which wemay gain, byfrequently considering how pleasing they aretoGod, how noble and excellent inthemselves, and how profitable and necessary forus,forfrom them allperfection hasitsorigin and end. Each morning, then, make astedfast resolve toexercise yourself inthem during the day, according tothe events which are likely to happen during theday;and often, asitpasses, examine yourself inorder tosee whether you have kept your resolution ornot;and renew it with fresh earnestness. And thisshould bedone especially with regard tothe theexamples OFACQUIRING VIRTUES tations and prayers onthe Life and Passion of Christ (soneedful inevery spiritual exercise), beallapplied principally topractise. Letthesame bedone onalloccasions (aswe shall presently explain more particularly), how ever different they may befrom one another. Let ustake pains toaccustom ourselves to interior and exterior acts ofvirtue, that wemay beenabled toperform them with the same facility and readiness, aswe did those which accorded with our natural will. And (aswe have said elsewhere) the more these acts are contrary tothe natural will, the more quickly will they produce thegood habit inthesoul. The sacred words ofthe Divine Scriptures, uttered bythe voice, oratleast with themind, and selected according totheoccasion, have a wonderful power toaidusinthis exercise. We ought therefore tokeep such texts in readiness asbear upon thevirtue wearepractis ing, and letthem berepeated during the day, especially whenever theopposite passion begins toassert itself. Thus, forexample, ifweare trying togain patience, wecan use the following words, or others like them :\u2014 \"Mychildren, suffer patiently thewrath that iscome upon you x.25.OF things !\" Weshould usethese short prayers, ejaculations,124 INVIRTUE because they are shot like darts orarrows towards Heaven. They have agreat effect upon us,stirring usto virtue, and penetrate even totheheart ofGod, if they have, sotospeak, these two wings :\u2014one, atrue knowledge that God ispleased with such spiritual exercises ;theother, atrue and ardent desire after holiness with thesole portant and necessary fortheattainment ofvirtues, this holiness; and, besides that, welose many graces and gifts, which, ifwehad continued topress onward, we might have gained from the Lord. Inthis reOFDILIGENT ADVANCE IN VIR TUE ofthe exertion, journey, thelonger the strength ; while thehigher nature, inwhich virtue resides, gets more firm andmore robust. Therefore, asweprogress inholiness, the pain which wefeltlessens, and acertain secret joy, which, bythe Divine working had inter mingled with it,increases more ofthemountain, where theperfected soul can work without weariness, nay, with pleasure and joyfulness ;because, having now conquered and tamed itsunruly passions, and having risen above allcreated things and above itself, it lives happily intheHeart oftheMost High, and there, sweetly inthepath ofholi ness wemust ever press onward without stopping. Therefore weought tobewatchful and expectant, lestweletslipanyopportunity which may present itself forthe increase ofavirtue ; and those who draw back from such contrary things asmight serve tothat purpose, make agreat mistake. For ifyou desire (not todepart from the virtue which has provided anexample hitherto) togrow inthe habit ofpatience, itis from the persons, deeds, orthoughts, tryyour patience. Therefore you have noneed togive upany ofyour associations, because they are tiresome toyou; but whilst you are dealing with and concerned with whatever brings you annoyance, keep your will disposed and ready toendure whatever vexation orunpleasantness may come toyou; else you will never get the habit of patience. Ifany employment beirksome toyou, it.Because ifyouleave it, youwould never learn tosuffer, neither would true peace ever beyour portion, asitdoes not spring except from asoul purified from passion andadorned with holiness. The same holds good ofharassing thoughts, which attimes molest and disturb themind. You need not drive them entirely away, for, together with thepain they cause you, they accustom youtobear contradictions. Whoever gives youdifferent advice, teaches yourather to shun thepain you feel, than togain thevirtue which youdesire. True, indeed, itisthatayoung soldier ought tomanoeuvre and guard himself with watchful ness anddexterity onsuch occasions, now fac ingtheenemy, now retiring, ashegains more orless spiritual strength and power ;yethe must never quite turn away and agreater risk, when exposed totheassaults of impatience, from nothaving armed andstrength128 OFEMBRACING OPPORTUNITIES ened himself beforehand with the practice of thecontrary virtue. This advice, however, must not befollowed when sins ofthe flesh are concerned, ofwhich wehave you should accept the opportunities which present themselves ofacquiring virtue isnot enough, beloved ;you should also sometimes seek them, asthings ofgreat price and value, and ever embrace them joyfully as soon asthey appear ;and themore distasteful they aretonature, themore dear and precious should they beesteemed. This, bytheDivine assistance, you will beenabled todo,ifyou will bear inmind thefollowing considerations. One is,that opportunities aremeans adapted, nay, necessary for acquiring virtues. Hence, when you are seeking virtues from the Lord, you arebyanecessary consequence asking also foropportunities, else your prayer would bevain, and you would becontradicting ownOFEMBRA norhumility without humiliations. there- fore themore acceptable and welcome should they be. For acts ofvirtue, done insuch cases, are more heroic andgenerous, andmore easily and quickly open tousthewaytoholiness. But even the slightest opportunity, though but aword orlook, which crosses ourwill, should beprized andnotallowed topass unused ; forsuch acts, though less intense than those made intheface ofconsiderable difficulties, are more frequent. Another consideration (ofwhich Ihave already spoken) is,that everything which happens touscomes from forourgood, and inorder thatwemay turn ittoaccount. And although (aswehave elsewhere said) some things spring from ourown defects, and those ofothers, and therefore cannot besaid to beofGod, Who wills nothing that issinful, yet arethey from God, inasmuch asHepermits them, and does notprevent them, though He hasitinHispower todoso.130 OPPORTUNITIES orofthemalice of areboth from God, and ofGod ;because He concurs inthem, and that which He would not have usdoasbeing utterly hateful and abominable inHis most pure eyes, Heyet wills that weshould suffer, both forour quicker growth. inholiness, and forother wise reasons unknown tous.

Indeed, Iwill gofurther and say, that, taking allthings into consideration, our Lord ismore pleased with our endurance ofthose sufferings which come tousfrom the misdeeds ofothers, especially from those who areunder anobligation tous,than with our endurance ofthose trials which arise from other distressing accidents. And this because our proud nature ismore humbled intheformer than inthelatter case ;and also because, bycheerfully enduring them, we domost especially please and magnify ourGod,OF THE EXERCISE OFASINGLE VIRTUE 131 working together with Him inthat which renders His unspeakable Goodness and Almightiness most conspicuous, namely, His way ofdrawing outofthedeadly poison ofmalice and wicked ness the sweet and precious fruit ofvirtue and goodness.

Ifitischarity, weshall perform acts oflove towards our neighbour, through whose instru mentality wemay thus progress ;and towards our Lord God, astheFirst and Loving Cause, from Whom our discomforts proceed, orbyWhom they are permitted toarise, forour discipline and spiritual improvement.

When, therefore, wenolonger feel contradiction and rebellion inour lower and sensual nature, and especially insudden and unexpected assaults, wemay look upon this as asign that thevirtue weare seeking has been acquired. And the greater thealacrity and brightness ofspirit with which these acts are done, the greater advantage may wehope toderive from their exercise. Beware, however, nottoassume avirtue, orgained alasting victory over apassion, even though foralong time, and after many battles, we may have ceased tofeel itsmotions within us. For the standard ofperfection towhich God calls us,however great ourprogress may have been inthewayofholiness, weshall hardly persuade ourselves that wehave even crossed itsthreshold. Asayoung soldier, then, and, asitwere, a continually toyour earliest exercises, toexamine have for theLord God, thetrue and only Searcher of ourhearts, gives this knowledge tosome nottoothers, find yourself insome painful position, and bearing itpatiently, be careful lest theDevil, ofself- love, lead you todesire tobefree from great evils might happen toyou. One is,that wish did not altogether destroy thevirtue ofpatience, itwould atleast gradually dispose you toimpatience. The other, that your patience would become defective, and would berewarded byGod only according tothelength oftime itwasexercised ; whereas, ifyou theremoval of the suffering, but had submitted unreservedly tothe Divine Will, your sufferings would have been accepted byGod asequivalent toaservice oflong endurance, though they had lasted but anhour, oreven less. Make this your universal rule inthis and in allthings, tokeep your desires sofarwithdrawn from every other object, that they may tend simply and purely totheir true and only end, \u2014OFGROWING INHOLINESS 137 theWill ofGod. Forthus will you\u2014whatever may happen inacon trary manner \u2014will remain calm and contented ; for,asnothing can take place except itbeap pointed bythe Supreme Will, ifyou will the same, you will come atalltimes both towill and tohave allthat happens and allthat beunderstood ofyour own sins orofthose forthese God wills not, itdoes apply toevery which God issometimes pleased tofavour His nearest and dearest friends. And what Isay ofthe endurance which we must exercise onalloccasions, must beunder stood also ofthose remains ofany trouble which wills ustobear, even after wehave used alllawful means tobefreed from it. And even inusing these means weshould be guided bythe Providence and Will ofGod, Who hasordained them, that wemight usethem according toHis Will, and not toplease our selves. Neither should wedesire norlove relief from trials, beyond that limit which His service requires and His Will appoints.138 OFRESISTING straight forward inthe path ofholiness with lively and well- regulated desires, and that hecannot draw us aside Saints, importunately urges ustoaspire indiscreetly totheheight ofperfection, that he may presently cause ustofallheadlong from it. With this inview heexcites ustochastise the body with great harshness, with scourges, fasts, hair-cloths, and other similar mortifications, that hemay either tempt ustopride, bythinking we aredoing great things (asisespecially the case with women), orthat hemay undermine our health, and sounfit usfordoing good works, or else that spiritual exercises may become irksome and distasteful tousthrough pain and over fatigue ;and thus bydegrees wegrow lukewarm inthe way ofgodliness, and atlast with greater avidity than before tothedelights and pleasures oftheworld.OFRESISTING THE DEVIL 139 With many this has been the case. They, having been led onbyapresumptuous spirit, and bythe impulses ofanindiscreet zeal, have, intheir excessive outward austerities, gone beyond the measure oftheir own strength, and sohave perished intheir own inventions, and have become the sport ofmalicious fiends. This would never have happened ifthey had laid toheart what wehave been saying and considering, which is,that painful acts ofthis sort, however praiseworthy and profitable to those whose bodily strength and lowliness of spirit are equal tothem, must yet ever be limited bythe requirements ofeach man's con stitution and temperament. And ifyou cannot imitate the Saints intheir austerities, you may find other features intheir character which you can copy, bystrong and effectual desires andfervent prayers, aspiring after themost glorious crowns ofChrist's true soldiers ; bydespising, asthey did, thewhole world, also; bygiving and solitude ;byhumility and gentleness towards allmen ;bypatience under wrongs, and kindness tothose who treated them ill;bywatch fulness against even upaltogether because ofexcesses. Igive persuaded that you arenotlikely tofallirrto theerror ofsome, who, though they pass forspiritual persons inthe world, yet are they deluded and ledastray by their deceitful nature into over-carefulness about the preservation oftheir bodily health. So jealous and anxious over itarethey, that forthe most trifling matter they live infear and dread oflosing it. There isnothing they think about more, orare more ready tospeak of,than the management oftheir bodily health. Hence they arealso planning how toprocure food suited rather totheir taste than totheir digestion, which latter has often been impaired bytheir indul gence indelicacies. And, although this isdone able toserve God better, itisbut attempt tounite foes, asarule ;yetitmust beaccompanied bythe discretion ofwhich I have been speaking, and have regard tothe differences ofconstitution and spiritual state, which cannot besubjected toanuniform rule.OFEVIL INCLINATIONS 141 Further than this, Iwould add, that not only inoutward things, but also inthe pursuit of inward holiness, weshould with arises another most hurt ful, namely, the practice ofrashly judging our neighbour, which leads ustodisparage, despise, and lower him. Asthis fault springs from pride and evil inclination, soisitthereby willingly cherished andfomented ;andourpride increases asthefault the more dowe inour opinion depreciate others, and imagine that we arefree from those imperfections which wemake ourselves believe weseeinthem. And thecrafty Devil, who sees this most evil disposition inus,stands ever onthe watch to open our eyes and make usquick-sighted to142 OFEVIL INCLINATIONS detect, examine, ofthisorthat person, bring then, byathousand passions, and but too prone tothink evil of another without justcause.

Know this, too, that when uncharitably you think you seeanevil inyour brother, some root ofthesame evil isinyour own heart, which, in proportion asitisill-disposed, readily sees in another that which isalready initself. When, weare inclined I,wretched being, buried very fault infarmore grievous ones, liftupmyhead toseeand judge thefaults ofothers?\" And thus theweapons which, when aimed at others, would have wounded you yourself, being used against yourself, bring healing toyour wounds. -But ifyou cannot disguise the fact that your brother hascommitted afault, yettake acom passionate view ofit,and believe that hehas hidden virtues, toguard which the Lord has permitted him tofall;or,that this failing is allowed tocling tohim foratime, that despised byothers, hemay learn tohumble him and thus become more pleasing toGod, and sohisgain atlastmay become greater and awful judgments ofGod ;and seehow many, once most wicked, attained atlasttoaneminent degree ofsanctity, whilst, ontheother hand, many who seemed to have reached sublime heights ofperfection, have fallen headlong into misery. Therefore ever fear and tremble foryourself more than foranyother. And beassured, that every good and kindly feeling towards your neighbour isthe work of the Holy Spirit ;and that alldisparagement, rash judgment, and bitterness against him, owe their origin totheevil that isinourselves and to thesuggestions oftheDevil.

This holy confidence isavessel into which Divine Mercy pours thetreasures ofHis grace ; andthelarger andmore capacious itis,themore richly laden will ourprayers return into our bosom. For how shall the Unchanging and Almighty God failtoimpart tousHisgifts, ? Thirdly, you must, when you draw nigh in prayer, seek theaccomplishment oftheDivine Will, and notofyour own, both bytheactof prayer you desire toobtain ; that is,pray, asanactofobedience tothe Divine Will, and desire tobeheard insofar only asGod wills.

And bringing both ofthese things before His Divine Majesty, ask through their virtue the grace which you desire. And this you may do, not only ineach Mystery ofour Lord's Passion, but ineach totheBlessed Virgin Mary. First, turn your thoughts tothe Eternal Father, next address yourself tothe sweet and beloved Jesus, and lastly, contemplate His ever-blessed Mother. Whilst turning toGod the Father, consider two things ;first, His delight inbeholding alleternity ofnothingness ;secondly, thegraces and virtues156 OF THE PRAYERS OF THE VIRGIN MARY she displayed, after God sent her into the world.

Concerning failures, defects, andsins, turn to God, and, grieving over your offences, sayto Him :\"Lord, Ihave done thisfrom what Iam, norshould where Idid,hadnot Thy Right Hand come tomyrescue Thee thanks.

ALTHOUGH hewho lives according to what has been already laid down will abide continually inpeace, Iwill inthis last chapter give two rules, which are also included inwhat hasbeen said, bykeeping which, youwill live and more tokeep thedoor ofyour heart closed against desires, for desire isthe long beam ofthe cross, and of anxiety, which will encumber you according to thegreatness ofthedesire. And ifthe desires beformany things, themore will bethebeams, which are prepared formany crosses. Then, when and obstacles intheway ofthe gratification ofthedesires arise, inthese behold the the arms ofthe cross, towhich isnailed thesoul that yields to desires. Whoever then would not have the cross, let him notdesire, and ifhefinds youarevexed or offended byothers, tosuch cases tothe Strength and Commands ofGod, inorder that youmay know what you ought todo,lestper chance your error may beworse than theirs. Forinthiswayyoushall return into thepath of virtue andpeace. For ifyou cannot deal rightly with yourself, what marvel isitifothers donotdeal rightly with forthis end alone, tobeloved and possessed by Him. And with this love you can make itdo whatever you wish, and every thing, however difficult itmight be,will inthis manner become easy toyou;therefore youmust afixed and established intention inyour heart, sothat outward actions may flow from inward. For, although corporal penances, and allthose exercises which chastise and afflict the flesh, are praiseworthy, when used with discre tion, and when adapted totheparticular circum glory ;and allyour labour will belost, unless these areanimated and guided byright inward itmay continue inpeace and quietness. And ifyou should feel the movement ofsome sensual disturbance within you, you must be careful toquiet itinstantly, stilling your heart, and not permitting ittoturn aside orwander after any ofthese things. Do this asoften as any cause ofdisquietude presents itself, whether inprayer, oratany other time, and know that when you have learnt toactthus, then you will have learnt topray aright ;but remember that allthis must bedone sweetly and gently. In short, thewhole and principal business ofyour life must consist incontinually quieting your heart, and never letting itgoastray. CHAPTER II.

And, ifsometimes you feel inthe Garden, togive you anexample, that prayer might beyour only resource and refuge, and that, however sadand desponding you may feel, you must not leave offpraying, until your will isconformed totheWill ofGod, and there fore hasbecome devout and calm, and also full ofcourage and fortitude, sothat itcan accept and embrace that which atfirst was anobject eonsrruereD. before said, not to permit anything todisturb your heart, and donotmeddle with things which are likely to disquiet it,butlabour ever tokeep itinpeace ; since inthis way, the Lord will build upwithin your soul acity ofpeace, and your heart shall beahouse ofpleasures anddelights.

This isvery evident, from thefact that noone experiences these trials except those persons who desire togive themselves inamore especial way totheservice ofGod, and thing may offend Him ;and tosuch these trials donotcommonly happen conversion, butafter served theLord, and when they areforming resolutions toserve more perfectly, andhave already begun who such trials ;whence itisclearly manifest thatthisisaprecious having consolation, and who, when these areabsent, esteems all other exercises tobebutlossoftime how itisthat temptations aresent usbyGod for our good, we must consider, that man, because oftheevilinclinations ofcorrupt nature, isproud, ambitious, conceited, and always thinks himself tobemore than heis. This self-esteem issodangerous totrue spiritual very scent ofitisenough tohinder the attainment ofperfection. Therefore our most faithful God, inthat loving Providence which Heexercises over each one, and especially over those who have truly given themselves upto His service, takes care theApostle St.Peter, permitting him todeny Him, that thus hemight know himself, and nolonger beself-confident ; and with theApostle St.Paul, who, after hehad been caught uptothethird heaven, and had heard Divine secrets, was visited with atrouble some temptation, tothe end that, knowing his natural weakness, hemight remain humble,OFTEMPTATIONS 299 glorying only inhisinfirmities ;and that the greatness oftherevelations which God made to him, should notlead him topresumption, ashe himself says. God, then, moved bycompassion forour misery and perverse inclinations, permits these temptations tocome upon us,andsometimes to bevery horrible, and tocome under different forms, thatwemay humble ourselves and know ourselves, though they seem toustobeuseless. Itisinthis way Hemanifests His Goodness andWisdom inmaking things which tous most hurtful tobemost helpful, them concludes that they arise from hisown imperfections, and that there cannot beanother soul soimperfect and so lukewarm ashisown;andhebelieves thatsuch thoughts thought himself tobesomething, isnow brought, bythisbitter medicine, sent him from God, toregard isonefavour which God confers onthe soul inthislifewhich hasplaced itself back and given itself upinto His Hands, and that is,to give itwhatever medicine Hepleases, and to offoritshealth andwell-being. which oursouls gain avoiding thing which seems tobeimperfect, may in anywayplace himatadistance from God. inhisjudgment appeared tobesoadverse andhurtful, served foralash to make himruntowards God with greater fervour, andkeep away from every thing which hethinks isnotinconformity with theDivine Will. And lastly, allthese trials, braving temptations andwithdrawals ofspiritual arebutaOFTEMPTATIONS 3OI loving purgatory, if(ashasbeen little ground there isfor thatdiscontent orthatalarm which inexperienced persons entertain, who attribute thistrial tothe devil, ortotheir own sins they perceived tnuiiselves tobetroubled with many temptations and imaginations, and found themselves dryand indevout inprayer and other exercises. On thecontrary, they would with fresh perseverance humble their souls inthesight oftheLord, purposing inalland through tobeserved bythem inthis world ;using diligence tokeep themselves peaceful and tranquil, taking every thing from theHand oftheir Heavenly Father, inWhose Hand alone isthecup from which they have todrink. For whether thetrouble and temptation arise from thedevil, orfrom oronaccount way, itisalways God you through various channels, asitpleases Him ;since itisonly the evil ofthepain which reaches you, and this is always ordered foryour good. Though, however, theevil Hemakes use salvation. Therefore, instead ofgiving way tosadness anddiscontent, youshould give thanks with inward joyand gladness, doing every thing that lies inyour power with perseverance and resolution, without losing time, and with that loss themany andgreat rewards, which God wills that you should gain bythis opportunity which Hepresents ordeed, such asdis happens to you, ormurmuring, has hap pened, norbeconfounded within yourself; atone time, believing that you will never befree from such infirmities ;atanother, that your faults and irresolution are the cause ofthem ;oragain, imagining that you arenotwalking inthe spirit and way oftheLord ;and thus with athousand other fears, pressing down your soul atevery step with discontent andcowardice. Hence itfollows, that you feel ashamed topresent yourself before God, oryou dosoinaspirit ofdistrust, asthough you preserved that which isHis due;and, asaremedy, you waste time inpondering over these things, scrutinizing how much you harboured the thought, and whether304 OFFAULTS and your anxiety toconfess it;and soyougoto confession with atedious fear, and, after having lost much time inmaking your confession, your spirit iseven more uneasy than itwas before it, forfear that you have not told all;thus your lifeisone spent inbitterness and anxiety, with little fruit, and with theloss inagreat measure ofitsreward. And allthis comes from not knowing your own natural weakness, and the way the soul should treat with God. For after having fallen into allthefaults wehave enumerated, orinto any others, wemay more easily treat with God byahumble and loving conversion, than bythe spirit ofgrief and discontent atthe fault itself, inthecase ofthe examination into venial and ordinary sins, towhich alone For itisonly such aspiritual life, and arestriving toadvance init,and are free from mortal sin. For those who live carelessly, and inmortal sin, and arealways more orless offending should betroubled and ought toweep, and to make their examination and confession with much thought, lestthrough their own fault and indifference, they render theremedy which is necessary fortheir salvation unavailing. To return, then, tospeak ofthequiet and peace in which theservant ofGod should ever abide, I will gofurther and say, that this conversion must time the Lord should permit youtofallinto such ;even though they may bemany together, ofweakness and frailty, but ofwilfulness. For thecontrition only the soul filled scruples, lead ittoperfection, unless ismore especially necessary inthecase ofpersons, who degree ofsanctity, and agreat love for,and union with, God. Many spiritual persons, from not wishing tounder stand thisaright, ever bear about with them a heart andaspirit, broken anddistrustful, which306 OFMAKING PROGRESS hinders their spiritual progress and capacity for thehigher graces, which one after another God hasprepared forthem. These often lead asort oflife which isvery wretched, useless, and pitiable, because they will follow only their own imaginations, and will notembrace thetrue and wholesome doctrine which leads bythe royal road tothehigh and solid virtues ofthe Chris tian life, and tothat peace which was left us byChrist Himself. Such persons, whenever they find themselves insome disquietude through doubts ofcon science, should seek thecounsel oftheir tual father, orofsome one whom they think capable ofgiving them the advice they need, and should commit themselves tohim, and rest entirely inhisjudgment. The conclusion of what wehave tosayconcerning thedisquietude which arises from failings, whenever you fall into a fault, beitgreat orsmall, though you may have committed the same four thousandOFMAKING PROGRESS 307 times inaday, andalways voluntarily and with advertency ;never allow yourself tofallinto a state ofmorose bitterness, and be disquieted, nor waste your time byscrutinis ingyourself, butatonce acknowledge what you have done, and, humbly regarding your own weakness, turn lovingly toyour God, andsayto Him with your lips, orwith your mind only : \"Lord, Ihave done this, being what Iam, and nothing else could beexpected from mesave only these andsimilar faults ;and Ishould not have stopped where Idid, had notThy Good ness lifted meup,andcontinued with me.
