Forest cover: Over half of Canada is covered in forests, which are [ located in eight distinct regions](https://treeera.com/canadas-famous-forests/). Some of the most well-known are the [ Great Bear Rainforest](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/great-bear-rainforest) in British Columbia , a temperate region that sprawls across 6.4 million hectares; [ Happy Valley Forest](https://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/where-we-work/ontario/our-work/natural-areas/happy-valley-forest.html) in Ontario, which supports more than 110 bird species and a number of species at risk; and [ Green Mountains Nature Reserve](https://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/where-we-work/quebec/featured-projects/eastern-township/green-mountains-nature-reserve.html) in Quebec, the largest privately held conservation area in the province with 7,001 hectares (17,300 acres) of untouched wilderness. Critical connections: Canadian ecologist [ Suzanne Simard](https://suzannesimard.com/?doing_wp_cron=1683750358.6837399005889892578125) discovered that trees are much more than they seem - they are social creatures that \"speak\" to each other, sharing information that supports the health of entire forests. \"Underground, there is this other world - a world of infinite biological pathways that connect trees and allow them to communicate, and allow the forest to behave as though it's a single organism,\" said Simard in her [ TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/suzanne_simard_how_trees_talk_to_each_other). Good for the body, mind, and spirit: Forests also have cultural and social impact. They are essential to the livelihood of Indigenous Peoples, particularly since most Indigenous communities are [ located in or near forested lands](https://www.ccfm.org/canadians-and-communities/indigenous-peoples-and-forests/). They also [ improve our quality of life](https://www.ccfm.org/canadians-and-communities/forests-an-integral-part-of-our-communities/) by promoting physical and mental wellbeing and providing recreational and ecotourism opportunities. In recent years, forest bathing ( [derived from the Japanese term shinrin-yoku](https://news.globallandscapesforum.org/33878/the-indigenous-wisdom-and-medical-properties-of-forest-bathing/), which means \"taking in the forest atmosphere\") has resurfaced as a way to reap the many health benefits of forests. Available to just about anyone, forest bathing involves mindfully walking in the woods and reaping the [ myriad benefits](https://parks.canada.ca/nature/science/conservation/foret-forest) - a strengthened immune system, reduced blood pressure, increased energy, boosted mood, and improved focus. While the practice enjoyed renewed popularity during the pandemic, its core principle of cultivating a deep connection with nature has been practiced by Indigenous Peoples for millennia.
