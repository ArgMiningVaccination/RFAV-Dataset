Continued economic uncertainty and a growing federal budget decit, greatly threaten NIH funding, clouding the future of biomedical research and academic medicine in general. At the state level, continuing budget reductions have forced the School of Medicine to master the art of doing more with less. Despite these challenges and uncertainties, we have pressed forward in new and exciting directions over the past year, strategically and oppor - tunistically, to grow our biomedical research enterprise. Simultaneously, we are continuing to educate and train new generations of outstanding physicians, scientists, and allied health professionals in order to enhance the health and science workforce. succeeding in the face of external challenges has been a hallmark of the school of Medicine for more than 200 years. one might suggest that this trait is encoded into the soM genome and that selective pressures have rendered our dna dominant or homozygous for the perseverance and determination genes. We are guided and influenced by our 200-year old blueprint for suc - cess, and in many instances, we are re-writing that coding with each passing day. New discoveries in our laboratories, new innovations in our clinical settings, and novel curriculum changes, are responsible for trans - forming the code that shapes our future. Each academic unit, indeed, each individual at the School of Medicine, plays an integral role in the success and evolution of this institution. Like any DNA-based organism, the School of Medicine has not simply survived. Rather, this institution has thrived, and its faculty, sta, trainees, students, and alumni have extended our influence and impact worldwide through clinical care, medical and allied health education, biomedical re - search, and community outreach. to be sure, the very essence of our mission is to change lives world - wide \u2014 through discovery and the introduction of new scientic knowl - edge that enhance the ability to diagnose, treat, and ultimately to cure diseases. As dean of one of America's top tier research institutions, I am both delighted and humbled by the sheer magnitude of the collective achievements of our School of Medicine this past year. Each year, we provide updates and share selected aspects of our mission areas and accomplishments. Thus it is with great pleasure that I present examples of these accomplishments. e. albert reece, Md, Phd, MBa Vice President & Dean 2011 I N T R O D U C T I O N As you know, at the heart of any organism is DNA, which contains the instructions that direct and signal an organism's functions, behaviors, and actions. We can draw an analogy of this scientic paradigm to the SOM, which has its own unique and inherent coding that guides its organizational functions, behaviors, and actions. We believe that the institutional values which help to drive our successes are guratively imprinted into the DNA of our faculty, sta, trainees, and students.

We take great pride in the diversity of our school and our university, because we believe it enriches the learning environment. Just before graduation, Match Day is one of the highlights of medical school. It is the day when graduating medical students learn where and in what specialty they will continue their edu - cation as residents.

There is also a high concentration of alumni in California, Texas, Virginia and North Carolina FIGURE 14. Even if they don't work in Maryland, many of our former students return to their medical school home for the annual alumni reunion. This year, more than 800 alumni attended the 136th Medical Alumni Association (MAA) re - union in May, which featured a number of special activities, including the annual Clinico-Pathological Conference (CPC). The CPC uses contemporary means to determine the cause of death of an historical gure. this year the cPc determined that charles darwin died of cyclic vomiting syndrome, chagas disease, and helicobacter pylori. Dr. Stewart Fine, professor and chair emeritus of the Department of Oph - thalmology at the University of Pennsylvania received the two highest awards from the MAA \u2014 the Honor Award and Alumni Gold key FIGURE 15.

With that vision in mind, our basic science and clinical researchers focus on diseases with high morbid - ity, high mortality, and high disability \u2014 areas where we can actually make an impact and transform lives for the better. These initiatives, including our most heavily funded research endeavors, emphasize collaboration across departments, programs, research centers, schools and universities. We must fuel this enormous and growing research enterprise by competing for external funding, including NIH funding, grants and contracts. Again this year, we reached a new high in research funding, but the total requires some explanation. Last year, we received $25 million in funding through the \"American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\" This one-time stimulus funding was used for construction and equipment costs. With that extra help, our total funding rose from $479 million last year to $486 million this year, a 1.5 percent increase FIGURE 17. When you exclude the one-time stimulus funding, our total research funding actually increased 12.5 percent. That is clearly a tremendous accomplishment in a very chal - lenging economic environment, and I extend congratulations and thanks to our entire faculty. This kind of growth is nothing new. since 2000, we have secured almost $4 billion in extramural funds for the school of Medicine. 2011 University of Maryland school of Medicine state of the school address R E S E A R C H 9INCREASING THE IMPACT OF RESEARCH AND DISCOVERY ON HUMAN HEALTH our goals: create and/or expand research magnet programs and funding increase emphasis on translational research increase emphasis on collaboration and multi-disciplinary groups increase consortia grants and contacts enhance faculty recruitment and retention achieve top-10 ranking MAJOR PROGRAMS BASED ON FUNDING aids/hiv aging Bioterrorism defense cardiovascular disease cancer community Mental health diabetes disparities genomics infectious diseases Metabolic disorders schizophrenia $3.9 BILLION in total grants & contracts and $1.7 BILLION in nih fUnding Recognizing the importance of translational medicine, biotechnology and collaboration, we have created two new major research programs: 1) the Program in Personalized and genomic Medicine is led by alan shuldiner, Md, the John L. Whitehurst Endowed Professor of Medicine and the new associate dean of Personalized and Genomic Medicine. 2) the center for Biomedical technologies at college Park is led by david Weber, Phd, professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Alan Shuldiner, MD David Weber, PhD new reSeArcH prOgrAMS 2011 10 R E S E A R C H fighting schizophrenia researchers at the school of Medicine are making strides in the quest for new treatments for schizophrenia, a debilitating brain disease aecting one percent of the world's population. Under the leadership of director WilliaM carPenter, Md, professor, department of Psychiatry, the Maryland Psychiatric research center (MPrc) is using brain imaging and animal models to better understand neuro circuits and receptors in the brain. for the rst time, Mprc scientists have linked a brain compound called kynurenic acid to cognition; possibly opening doors for new ways to enhance memory function and treat catastrophic brain diseases. When researchers decreased the levels of kynurenic acid in the brains of mice, their cognition was shown to improve markedly. the study, which was published in the journal neuropsychopharmacology, is the result of decades of pioneering research in the lab of roBert schWarcz, Phd, professor, departments of Psychiatry, Pediatrics and Pharmacology and experimental therapeutics. the fUtUre of transplant research school of Medicine researchers are leading the way in transplant research, uncovering the secrets of the immune system in order to prevent rejection following organ transplants. Jonathan s. BroMBerg, Md, Phd, who heads the division of transplanta - tion within the department of surgery, is studying the migration and tracking of lymphocytes and the structure of secondary lymphoid organs. \"We are one of the very few laboratories in the world looking at how struc - ture aects immune response,\" says dr. Bromberg. \"We are the only laboratory in the world looking at that structure in terms of transplant models.\" another area of interest is the microbiota \u2014 the microorganisms that live on and inside of the human body. targeting Malaria Myron levine, Md, dtPh, the simon and Bessie grollman distinguished Professor of Medicine, and director of the University of Maryland school of Medicine's center for vaccine development (cvd), is reporting signicant progress in the search for an eective malaria vaccine. Kirsten lyKe, Md, associate professor, department of Medicine, is on a team of researchers who developed a safe malaria vaccine that uses the entire malaria parasite to produce a strong immune response. The vaccine is unique in that it employs the entire malaria parasite, while most experimental malaria vaccines consist of just one or at most a few proteins found in the parasite. the vaccine \u2014 the rst whole parasite vaccine to be approved by the U.s. food & drug administration for clinical trials \u2014 could provide unprecedented immune responses against malaria when administered intravenously. another important breakthrough came from christoPher PloWe, Md, Phd, professor, department of Medicine. in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine , dr. Plowe and his team demonstrated the importance of matching the vaccine to the particular strain of malaria circulating in the population.

The Association of American Medical Colleges collects data for all medical schools across the nation in order to create objective rankings based on total grants and contracts and direct expenditures. In 2010, we ranked 7th among the 76 public medical schools nationwide, which puts us in the top 10 percent. Of the 134 public and private medical schools across the nation, we re - main in the top 15 percent, ranking 17th. Both rankings are pleasing to us, but our sights are set much higher FIGURE 18. Another important measure we want to look at is technology transfer. In FY10 and FY11, some 40 patents have been issued for innovations and discoveries made by School of Medicine faculty members FIGURE 19. We are making an impact through an increased number of scientic disclo - sures, technology licenses, and start-up companies. Many new therapies are in the phase-two or phase-three clinical trial stage. They're focused on diseases with high morbidity, high mortality, and high disability FIGURE 20.

Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of it. From a positive perspective our lack of space is a sign of productivity. We are securing about $475 of grant funding per square foot, making us the 14th most ecient medical school with regard to the use of research space FIGURE 21. That's good news! The bad news is we don't have enough research space to grow, to recruit faculty, and to expand our research programs as much or as quickly as we would like. The construction of the SOM research building, Health Sciences Facil - ity III (HSF III) will open the doors to the expansion of our research pro - grams, which already comprise the fourth fastest growing research enterprise in the country, according to the AAMC. this year, i am pleased to report that we are well on our way toward making hsf iii a reality. i want to acknowledge and thank the Maryland general assembly for ap - proving $4 million dollars in matching funds to begin the architectural and engineering design of hsf iii. this is a $286 million and over 300 square-foot research building. We have also received tremendous sup - port from the Governor's oce, from University of Maryland President Jay Perman, MD, and from University System of Maryland Chancellor William Kirwan, PhD. They recognize our physical constraints and have been very supportive of our need for a new research building. I can't wait to see this building get started. HSF III will be located on the site of the old Dental School on Baltimore Street FIGURE 22.

We are inextricably linked to each other and as a consequence, we're able to provide the best possible patient-centered care across the state. I am working with UMMS President and CEO Robert Chrencik to assure a symbi - otic organizational alignment. The benets of this partnership are evident throughout this publication and are chronicled by our joint annual report. Our faculty members deliver care through University of Maryland Faculty Physicians, Inc. (FPI -formerly UPI), which generated $227 million in total revenue in FY11, a seven percent increase FIGURE 23. Our faculty practice, which generates clinical dollars to support school salaries and operations, continued to be successful despite the ongoing challenge of reduced reimbursements. Total patient volume, including inpatient and outpatient visits increased 3.5 percent to 1.1 million, while admissions to the University of Maryland Medical Center increased 3.3 percent to 39,500 FIGURE 24. In addition, we had very substantial and very respectable improvements in three key indicators of practice plan performance. The number of days in accounts receivable was reduced to 48 days. The number of accounts greater than 90 days was down to 20 percent and the initial denial rate was down to 6.2 percent FIGURE 25. This is excellent practice plan performance.

I am pleased to congratulate our clinical faculty and the medical center for earning a number of important accolades. credit goes not only to our faculty, but to the leadership and sta of the medical center for their hard work and dedication to excellence in patient care. The University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) has been desig - nated by the Leapfrog Group, as a top hospital of the decade for patient safety and quality of care. Once again, UMMC has been ranked among the top 50 hospitals na - tionwide in nine specialties by U.S. News and World Report. In addition to a great showing in the Best Hospital rankings, more than 40 School of Medicine faculty physicians were named to the U.S. News and World Report's Top Doctors list. UMMC has been designated as a cardiac interventional center by the state of Maryland. The designation means that ambulances transport - ing patients suering from life-threatening, in-progress heart attacks will take patients directly to centers such as UMMC. The American Heart Association recognized UMMc with the Gold Level Award as a Fit-Friendly Company. UMMc received two prestigious environmental excellence awards: The 2010 Trailblazer Award, for its innovative pharmaceutical waste program, and a national environmental excellence award from Practice Greenhealth. Specialists at the UMMc center for diabetes and endocrinology and UniversityCare received the National Committee on Quality Assurance Diabetes Recognition. This is given to top clinicians who have demonstrated a high level of performance in delivering care to patients with diabetes. lisa rowen, dnsc, rn, Chief Nursing Ocer, and Senior Vice President of Patient Care Services, received the nursing excellence award from Nursing Spectrum magazine in the category of \"Advancing and Leading the Profession.\" 2011 University of Maryland school of Medicine state of the school address P A R T N E R S H I P A N D R E C O G N I T I O N 21 A total of 66 School of Medicine physicians, all of whom also practice at the uMMc, were selected to baltimore Magazine's list of \"Top Doc - tors.\" The results are based on a baltimore Magazine survey of more than 5,500 randomly selected physicians in the baltimore area, includ - ing baltimore city and the surrounding ve counties, asking where they would send a member of their family in each of 86 specialties.

Community outreach and service remains a cornerstone of the student experience at the School of Medicine, and this year our student body participated in more than 250 projects. The Student National Medical As - sociation (SNMA) at the School of Medicine was so active in the commu - nity, it was named national chapter of the year. snMa members provided health education and screening in the community, collected coats and blankets for the homeless, and provided school supplies and Christmas gifts for children in need FIGURE 26. for the 21st consecutive year, our medical students organized Project feast to feed hundreds of Baltimore's homeless and needy families on thanksgiving day. Students, faculty, sta, and friends gathered at Booker T. Washington Middle School in Baltimore City to help prepare and serve a hot Thanksgiving meal and accept donations to help the needy FIGURE 27. Other community outreach events included the Student Sight Savers Project, which oered glaucoma screenings at Lexington Market. Mini-Med school \u2014 held annually in the Fall \u2014 featured nine new topics to improve the health and well being of Baltimore area residents. Faculty members generously gave their time and knowledge to help people learn how to prevent and treat illness. More than 300 people attended this year's edition of the popular community outreach initiative FIGURE 28. The School of Medicine also sponsors Mini-Med School programs on the Eastern Shore, in western and southern Maryland, and at Baltimore area high schools. Mini-Med School is not only important for the improve - ment of the health and well- being of the community, but it provides in - spiration and motivation that transforms lives. one of our Mini-Med school students, who attended as a college student, was so inspired that he enrolled in the school of Medicine and will graduate in 2012 .

More than half of our total operating budget (53 percent) is comprised of research grants and contracts. Excluding one-time stimulus funding from the previous year, research funding increased 12.5 percent and 1.5 per - cent overall to $486.3 million in FY11. A large portion of our revenue (40 percent) comes from clinical activities performed by faculty physi - cians, with 24 percent from practice plan fees for service, and 15 percent from contracts with our hospital partners. The remaining income comes from tuition, state appropriations and/or gifts. Even in these times of economic uncertainty, we were pleased to see increases from all revenue sources except direct state support FIGURE 32. the school of Medicine's direct economic impact on the region is nearly $2 billion. The total is even more impressive when you combine the impact of the school and our clinical partners. The University of Maryland Medical Center has an economic impact of $2 billion and the economic impact of the system's other healthcare facilities is $1.4 billion. together, our economic impact on the state of Maryland is more than $5 billion. Because of declining state support and an uncertain economy, private gifts are critical, if we are to sustain our standard of excellence and continue our research growth. Thanks to the eorts of the Oce of Development, I am pleased to report that private gifts and pledges reached $66.1 million dollars in FY11, an eight percent increase over last year and a new record FIGURE 32. 2011 University of Maryland school of Medicine state of the school address F I N A N C E & P H I L A N T H R O P Y 25 F I G U R E 3 2 reVenue in Millions fy10 fy11 change grants & contracts $479.1 $486.3 1.5% tuition o n s 18.7% 6.7% 5.5% 5.0% 8.0% F I G U R E 3 1 26 2011 I want to acknowledge and thank a number of individual donors who made signicant gifts to the School of Medicine.
