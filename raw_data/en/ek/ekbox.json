The veteri- nary team 's role includes providing medical care and support to senior pets to maintain their quality of life, as well as supporting and educating clients on proper senior animal care and addressing any misconceptions about the aging process. These Guide- lines describe a systematic approach to the healthcare of the senior pet that is based on an evidence-guided assessment of both healthy and unhealthy canine and feline patients. By using evidence-guided medicine, which may include conventional and integrative approaches as well as environmental management for the senior pet, the patient 's quality of life can be enhanced and potentially extended during this vulnerable life stage. Developing a senior program for the veterinary practice requires appropriate training of the entire healthcare team and includes a robust client education program that focuses on the wellbeing of the senior pet. Palliative and hospice care should be included in the education and information provided for boththe veterinary team and the families of senior pets. (J Am Anim Hosp Assoc 2023; 59:1 -21.

The senior dog or cat requires a tailored healthcare plan including preventive, diagnos-tic, and treatment protocols that are speci c to the aging animal 's physiologic needs. In addition, families with older pets may have a strong bond of affection and interdependence that may not be mea- s u r e di nm o n e t a r yt e r m sa n ds h o u l db ec o n s i d e r e di nt h eo v e r a l lhealthcare plan. A useful perspective for the veterinary team may include the following considerations: /C15For many clients, their pets 'senior years are as important and mean- ingful as the sum of all the preceding life stages. /C15Managing the health and wellbeing of the aging pet is an important aspect of clinical practice. Healthcare decisions affecting the older pet may be clinically challenging for the veterinarian and may be affected by the physical, psychosocial, emotional, or spiritual needs of the pet 'sf a m i l y .O p t i m a l care of the senior pet involves a multifaceted approach, includingdiagnostics, medical and interventional therapies, pain management,nutrition, dentistry, anesthesia, modifying the environmental setting, managing behavioral problems, and recognizing and managing comorbidities. Senior care also includes educating and planning forend-of-life care for the patient and supporting the caregivers and fam- ily in this process. The Guidelines include a comprehensive table, organized by body system, which presents diagnostic approaches forcommonly encountered diseases of senior dogs and cats. The Guide-lines also include a table of common diagnostic tests and recom- mended frequencies for senior patients and home care tips for clients. These Guidelines represent the recommendations of a task force of experts with decades of collective experience in caring for agingcanine and feline patients. The authors have organized the Guide- lines into three principal sections: /C15Evaluating and managing the healthy senior pet. /C15Evaluating and managing the unhealthy senior pet, which includes an end-of-life section. /C15Developing education for both veterinary teams and clients that emphasizes the care and wellbeing of the senior pet. These Guidelines offer recommendations that can assist practi- ces in developing additional education resources that highlight per- sonalized senior pet care. This approach can promote: /C15Expertise and consistent messaging in senior care among the veteri- nary team. /C15Client education that creates awareness of \"best practices in senior pet care \"for maintaining the health of older dogs and cats. /C15Involvement of the entire veterinary team in educating clients on the health and quality of life (QOL) of senior pets. The Guidelines are not intended to be all-inclusive in their rec- ommendations, but to present an evidence-guided framework forsenior pet healthcare. The text cites various previously published clinical guidelines on speci c topics such as dentistry, pain manage- ment, anesthesia, nutrition, and end-of-life care that practitioners can refer to for in-depth recommendations appropriate for the senior dog or cat. A focus on senior pet care has many bene ts for veterinary practices and their clients. These include strengthening the human- animal bond, enhancing and extending the patient 's quality and duration of life, and deepening the veterinary/client/patient relationship. Defining the Senior Patient The term \"senior \"is used to describe the older, aging pet. Because of the variability in aging based on species and breed, there is no spe- cic age for senior status. Moreover, the criteria for senior age status differ for dogs and cats. The 2019 AAHA Canine Life Stage Guide- lines dene senior as \"the last 25% of estimated lifespan through end of life. \"1The2021 AAHA/AAFP Feline Life Stage Guidelines and the 2021 AAFP Feline Senior Care Guidelines dene senior as cats greater than 10 yr of age.2,3 Additional descriptive terms may be used to describe a senior pet's condition, such as \"frailty, \"\"immunosenescence, \"and \"inflammaging. \"Frailty is a syndrome seen with advancing age ini- tially described in people, in which the patient has a decreased func- tional reserve that leads to a decline in physiological and cognitive performance and a greater vulnerability to adverse medical out- comes.4Scoring systems exist for assessment of frailty in dogs, and increased frailty scores may be a risk factor for death, although more studies are needed.4,5Feline phenotype and index-based frailty scales are also available.3 Aging may have multiple biochemical changes that are notice- able only in the later stages of the age-related change. Earlier identi - cation of age-related changes may improve the quality and quantity of life, but additional research is needed to detect those early bio- chemical changes and be able to use them as screening tests. Immu- nosenescence is the process of immune dysfunction that occurs with age. Immunosenescence involves the remodeling of lymphoid organs, leading to changes in the immune function of the elderly, which is closely related to the development of infections, autoimmune dis-eases, and malignant tumors. 6Evidence for this phenomenon has been reported in human medicine, but there is limited evidence in veterinary medicine. In flammaging is another concept reported in human medicine, which posits that the rate of aging and age-related disease may be due to a chronic progressive proin flammatory pheno- type.7The occurrence of immunosenescence and in flammaging in d o g sa n dc a t sh a sy e tt ob ev a l i d a t e da n ds h o u l db ec o n s i d e r e da s 2 JAAHA | 59:1 Jan/Feb 2023hypothetical concepts in veterinary medicine until further evidence emerges. Evaluating the Healthy Senior Pet The initial intake at an of ce visit is essential for setting a welcoming and senior-friendly tone. Starting with an open-ended question like \"What brings you and Harvey here today? \"is a good way to initiate a conversation about the pet 's health and wellbeing. Eliciting a thor- ough history and gaining an understanding of the senior pet 'se n v i - ronment and background are crucial to establishing a relationship with the client and pet. Often there are issues not mentioned when the appointment was made that are best brought forward early in thevisit. Older animals often come with a substantial list of concerns,which the client and veterinarian can mutually discuss and prioritize. 8 The client may share additional crucial information about their senior pet if they are supported with empathy. A thorough history can provide important information to assess the pet 'sh e a l t ha n d may include exploring the patient 's eating and drinking habits, exer- cise, movement, play behavior, eliminations, attitude, grooming,vision, and hearing. Inquiring about any changes or disruptions in the household may also elicit crucial information. A critical aspect of a patient 's history is establishing what phar- maceuticals, supplements, nutraceuticals, creams, oils, or other ther-apeutics are currently being given to the pet. This is important toevaluate the need for additional therapeutics and minimize drug interactions, and it is part of building a trusted relationship between client and veterinarian. Drug interactions may result in serious tox-icities, negate the effect of medications, or create a physical changethat would be detrimental to the animal (e.g., a nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug given to an animal currently taking steroids, resulting in gastrointestinal bleeding). Practitioners may need toevaluate any nutraceuticals the pet is currently on for potential inter-actions (e.g., turmeric, which is touted as an anti-in flammatory aid, yet has been shown to cause gastrointestinal ulceration in humans and mice). 9,10Additional examples include melatonin products made with xylitol and nutraceuticals like St. John 's Wort, turmeric (major component curcumin), ginseng, s-adenosyl-methionine, mel-atonin, and tryptophan that increase 5-hydroxytryptophan and can contribute to serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome may occur with these nutraceuticals if the animal is also medicated with drugscommonly used in senior patients, including selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine, tricyclic antidepressants such anti-depressants opioids such asfentanyl and tramadol. Clients using cannabis products or other nontraditional therapies for their pets may be reluctant to disclosethis information unless they have built a trusted relationship with the clinician. Clients may believe that some products are safe simplybecause they are labeled as \"natural. \"Veterinarians must educate cli- ents about the challenges and risks of using herbal, nutraceutical, orother therapies that may include lack of purity and potency certi ca- tions as well as potential toxicity, drug interactions, and potentialinjury. A thorough physical examination can elicit more information as the next step in a senior pet appointment. A relaxed animal in acomfortable environment allows for a more accurate examinationincluding detailed attention to the eyes and mouth, as well as palpa-tion of the spine, neck, joints, musculature, digits, abdomen, andthoracic auscultation. When assessing musculoskeletal pain, mobility,and movement, checklists can be used as a screening tool and mayprovide additional information for both client and veterinarian.Chronic pain scales are a useful tool to assess musculoskeletal pain. 11 For additional information on assessing chronic pain, see the 2022 AAHA Pain Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats .12Client vid- eos of their animal moving in their environment are additional use-ful tools to assess musculoskeletal pain, mobility, and movement.Videos of the pet ambulating or jumping can help detect early neu-ropathic or musculoskeletal disease. A senior pet appointment may address issues such as decreased mobility from osteoarthritis, metabolic issues such as kidney or liverdisease, and functional issues such as heart disease or neoplasia. Formobility issues, older animals may bene t from the use of pet- friendly techniques (low-stress handling, softened table examinationsurfaces or examining the pet off the table), as pain and distress maybe more common for senior animals. 13,14Mobility may be reduced owing to arthritic changes, and care must be taken to gently manipu-late limbs, joints, musculature, neck, and spine to explore underlyingdiscomfort. Unlike dogs, cats rarely have crepitus in affected joints.However, studies have indicated that more than 60% of cats haveosteoarthritis in at least one joint despite absence of this physicalexamination nding. 11-13,15 Neoplasia is more commonly found with senior pets and may be indicated from a thorough physical examination. Cutaneousmasses noted on physical examination should be measured in allthree dimensions, aspirated, and cytologically examined. Clinically,neoplasms such as mast cell tumors may be indistinguishable frombenign growths (e.g., ubiquitous lipomas) and they may coexist,making the \"watch and see \"approach risky. A thorough, gentle abdominal and rectal palpation may also provide an early indicationof abnormalities. Special attention should be given to the oral cavity,eye, and digits as sites of potential neoplasia. A medical workup is also recommended for senior pets once or twice a year and may include a complete blood count, chemistry, and2023 AAHA Senior Care Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 3u r i n a l y s i s ,a sw e l la sd i a g r a m so rp h o t o g r a p h st ob e t t e rt r a c kc h a n g e s and screening biomarkers such as symmetric dimethylarginine assay, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein. It may also include other tests listed in Table 1, Diagnostic Tests and Recommended Frequencies for Senior Dogs and Cats. Anesthetic and Surgical Considerations Practitioners will nd the 2020 AAHA Anesthesia and Monitoring Guidelines for Dogs and Cats to be a useful, comprehensive supple- ment to this section of the Senior Care Guidelines.16 Senior pets may require general anesthesia for surgical and non- surgical procedures, such as dental care, to treat ailments and/or improve their QOL. Advanced age alone is not a contraindication to general anesthesia. Senior pets can safely undergo multiple anesthetic events if necessary. Medication choices and other precautions should be considered to minimize the risk for the pet. Because clients may have additional anxiety about anesthesia for their senior pet, the role of the veterinarian and technician includes reassuring the client of the indication for and safety of the procedure. An anesthetic evaluation should include a preoperative physical examination, focusing on diseases that may increase risk. In addition to the physical examination, preoperative laboratory tests should be performed, with a speci c focus on renal (creatinine) and cardiac function (N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide). Imaging, including radiographs and ultrasonography, may also be indicated. Preoperative care may include preprocedural IV fluids in a patient with compromised renal function, where fasting or anxiety associated with hospitalization may decrease normal water consumption. Preox- ygenation may be recommended for patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary illnesses. Induction, maintenance, and monitoring anesthesia are also sig- nicant, and checklists and anesthetic forms may be used to mini- mize risk and complications. A dedicated, trained technician with a checklist can focus on monitoring anesthesia and be prepared for any potential complications associated with either the individual patient or speci c risks associated with the procedure. Checklists can be comprehensive and may include handling of the pet, padding for the animal, monitoring tools, surgical needs such as blood product availability if hemorrhage is a potential complication, preoperativeand postoperative analgesia and other indicated medications, a vali- d a t e dp a i ns c a l et h a ti ss p e c i e ss p e c i c, and a postoperative plan and patient discharge instructions. To lessen mobility complications, senior pets should be kept warm, handled gently, placed in a com- fortable position, and kept on a well-padded surgical or treatment table. To minimize the time of anesthesia for the pet, it is recom- mended that the surgeon be readily available at the time of anesthesiainduction. Other considerations for anesthesia with a senior pet may include titrating doses of anesthetic agents as lower doses may be needed. Postprocedural analgesics should be prescribed as indicated by the procedure; consider that the dose needed for opioids and other analgesics may be different for senior pets. Validated pain scales can be very useful for postoperative analgesia care. 12 From a surgical standpoint, the bene t to quality or quantity of life should be established with the client before surgery is performed. Many surgeries, including dental procedures, can result in substantial improvement in QOL. However, perhaps the biggest predictor of postsurgical QOL is preprocedure function; for example, a healthy, robust 15 yr old terrier would be expected to recover quickly from amass removal, whereas a 13 yr old Labrador mixed-breed dog with geriatric onset laryngeal paralysis polyneuropathy (GOLPP), severe osteoarthritis, and International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage 3 renal disease may require a longer recovery time. 68 The surgeon should be experienced with the procedure and/or have adequate training in similar techniques. All necessary equip- ment should be prepared and potential surgical needs anticipated (e.g., implant, speci c instrument). For senior pets, recovery times are improved with speed of the procedure and meticulous focus by the surgeon. Perioperative antibiotics and pain management should be provided if indicated. Postprocedural return to function is enhanced with appropriate analgesics, and physical therapy/rehabili- t a t i o nm a ya l s ol e a dt oam o r er a p i dr e t u r nt of u n c t i o n . Dentistry The2019 AAHA Dental Care Guidelines for Dogs and Cats provide a comprehensive supplement to this section of the Senior Care Guide- lines.17Senior pets may have an increased risk for oral cavity issues, such as periodontal disease and oral neoplasia. They should be assessed with a good oral examination, especially if the patient has trouble prehending or chewing or swallowing food or shows discom- fort during the process. The oral cavity and pharynx should be thor- oughly examined for the presence of periodontal disease, oral tumors, or dental disease (including broken or resorbing teeth). Examination of the oral cavity should be done at every veterinary visit. Videos taken by the client of unusual eating practices by the petcan help assess the problem. The incidence of periodontal disease is increased in smaller and older dogs. 18Tiny and small senior dogs may have signi cant peri- odontal bone loss, which may result in pathologic fractures. Small senior pets may have a higher incidence of pathologic fracture in the mandibles, due to increased bone loss and less dense bone. The gen- eral systemic health of a senior may also be affected by the presence of a chronic in flammatory process such as periodontitis.19 4 JAAHA | 59:1 Jan/Feb 2023TABLE 1 Diagnostic Tests and Recommended Frequencies for Senior Dogs and Cats Diagnostic Test Recommended Frequency Canine Feline Fecal testing f or par asites 1-4 times/yr, depending on use of preventive products and lifestyle. 1-2 times/yr, depending on health and lifestyle factors.

Because of their advanced age and possible physiologic de cits, senior pets undergoing anesthesia should receive special attention as discussed in the preceding section on anesthesia. Dental radiographs are recommended to assess the extent and pattern of bone loss and con rm appropriate extractions. Radio- graphs may uncover unanticipated dental or periodontal disease requiring additional treatment,20,21but these procedures may need to be staged to avoid excessive length of procedures and time under anesthesia. Periodontal disease incidence is lower in cats than in dogs. Senior cats are less likely to develop conditions such as feline chronicgingivostomatitis, more often seen in younger pets, but the presence of tooth resorption can cause discomfort and may require intervention. 22 Oral tumors are more common in older dogs and cats and may be large at the time of diagnosis because of the occult nature of can- cer. Early detection is key to better outcomes. Diagnosis of the tumor type will help formulate a treatment plan, which may include, but is not limited to, en bloc excision, aggressive resection, radiation ther- apy, and adjuvant cytotoxic or immunotherapy. Cats tend to develop oral squamous cell carcinomas that may be located in the gingiva, tongue, or tonsils. Although locally very aggressive, these tumors tend to be slow to metastasize to the lymph nodes or other loca- tions.23Dogs more commonly develop oral melanocytic tumors that behave aggressively locally and show higher rates of distantmetastasis. 23 For more advanced or complex oral disease, consider a referral to a board-certi ed veterinary dentist. If referring a patient with complex disease is not possible, consider staging procedures to mini- mize anesthetic risk. Often, resolution of oral and dental issues in our senior dogs and cats can greatly improve their QOL, making the risks worth the bene ts. Nutrition Diet and Body Condition The 2021 AAHA Nutrition and Weight Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats provide comprehensive recommendations for canine and feline nutritional management.24Senior pets may have changing energy and nutrition requirements and may experience muscle or overall weight loss due to changes in the senior body such as immu- nosenescence, in flammaging, or a disease process. Evaluation of muscle and body condition scores can help monitor normal aging and age-related disease changes and determine when nutritional adjustment may be needed. Maintenance energy requirements(MER) generally decrease over a dog 's lifetime. MER decrease in cats up to age 10, after which they start to increase.25-27However, pub- lished data on the effects of age on energy requirements are extremely variable in cats. Calorie-restrictive diets have been shown to increase dogs 'longevity,28with an ideal body condition score (BCS) of 4.5 to 5 out of 9. A cat 's ideal BCS, up to 6 out of 9, can be associated with increased longevity, with underweight cats having greater morbidity and mortality risks.29 Senior cats may be less able to digest and utilize nutrients. Decreased food digestibility may contribute to weight and muscle loss. Proteins are less digestible in 20% of cats older than 11 yr, and fats are less digestible in up to 33% of cats.30Food digestibility may be less of an issue with dogs.31,32In a recent study, adding moisture to foods increased the digestibility of nutrients in senior dogs.33 Reduced protein synthesis and increased turnover of proteins may contribute to the loss of lean body mass (LBM) in senior pets.34 Sarcopenia is the anticipated loss of LBM with age, with up to 33%loss in cats from 10 to 15 yr of age. 30Dogs tend to lose LBM and gain fat as seniors and incur overall weight loss with advanced age.35 Senior pets, particularly cats, may need up to 50% more protein toi m p r o v eo rs l o wm u s c l el o s s . 34Cachexia may also be present and refers to weight loss with excessive LBM loss due to severe or chronic disease, such as chronic kidney disease, heart disease, and neoplasia. Senior pets may also develop obesity, which is more common in dogs. Increased BCS and obesity are known to affect mobility and contribute to in flammatory processes and diseases. Poor mobility and decreased activity are assessed in frailty scores and are associatedwith a shorter time to death. 36 Healthy Senior Nutrition The Association of American Feed Control Of cials does not cur- rently have guidelines for senior nutrition. However, senior dogs h a v ed e c r e a s e dM E Ra n dn e e dl e s sc a l o r i cd e n s i t ya n dm o r e ber to optimize BCS. A senior diet may include mild increases in protein content and quality to compensate for LBM loss.37Healthy senior cats may require higher-caloric-density, higher-protein diets with increased digestibility and enhanced palatability fed in smalleramounts more frequently to help them maintain adequate muscle and body weight. 34 Evaluating the Unhealthy Senior Pet Senior pets are at greater risk for illness to occur in their nal years, although the incidence and mortality for all diseases combined have shifted over time primarily due to improved preventive medicine measures, diagnostic advances, better nutrition, and greater access to veterinary health care. 6 JAAHA | 59:1 Jan/Feb 2023Prevention and screening for chronic diseases are discussed in the section \"Evaluating the Healthy Senior Pet \"and can establish a baseline for healthy senior pet care. When disease does occur insenior pets, the history, physical examination, and diagnostic toolscan help establish a diagnosis and determine a course for care. Inter-preting diagnostic tests and reaching a clinical diagnosis should becongruent with clinical presentation, laboratory values, imaging, his-topathology, and epidemiology. Common clinical signs of chronic disease may include malaise, progressive lethargy, behavior changes, hyporexia, anorexia, alteredthirst pattern, weight loss over time, mobility alterations, and nonheal-ing wounds. A suspected chronic disease can often be presumptivelydiagnosed based on the client 's account of the pet 'sh i s t o r ya n dp h y s i c a l examination, although it is recommended to perform appropriate clini-copathological evaluations. The minimum database for a senior petshould include a detailed blood pro le including thyroid panel and uri- nalysis. Additional screening or diagnostic tests may be used dependingon the minimum database and may include thoracic, abdominal, andother imaging. Diagnostic approaches for senior dogs and cats basedon body system are summarized in Table 2, Diagnostic Approaches b yB o d yS y s t e mf o rS e n i o rD o g sa n dC a t s . 38This list is not exhaus- tive and additional diagnostic approaches may be warranted. Unknown Diagnosis or Comorbidities Senior pets may have several concurrent medical issues and associ- ated clinical signs. These complex cases may be referred to an appro-priate specialist. Alternatively, the client may opt for palliative care,and it may be helpful to have a trained palliative care veterinarian toconsult with on the case. There may be clients who do not wish to pursue diagnostics for a number of reasons, including the age of the pet, concern and fearof certain test procedures or outcomes, and nancial constraints. If the client chooses to not pursue diagnostics or treatment, veterinar-ians should discuss the bene t of symptomatic treatment and how it can improve the pet 's QOL. This may encourage the client to access and continue palliative care. If the client chooses to seek additionaldiagnostics, then either performing them or seeking referral to a spe-cialist may be indicated for complex comorbidities. Managing Cognitive Dysfunction and Behavioral Anxiety Canine and feline cognitive dysfunction (CCD/FCD) is an age- related neurodegenerative condition well described in dogs but lessso in cats. Approximately 14 -22.5% of dogs older than 8 yr suffer from age-related cognitive impairment. 39Clinical signs of cognitive dysfunction vary between dogs and cats and may not be recognizedby clients in the earlier stages. Early recognition of this condition is crucial as treatment is more effective in the earlier stages of CCD,and this condition may signi cantly affect the quality of the human- animal bond. 40 The pathophysiology of CCD is similar to Alzheimer disease in people. Beta amyloid plaques are seen in both, most commonly asinsoluble beta amyloid, but there are also soluble forms. In addition,Tau neuro brillary tangles may play a role in FCD but do not appear to play a role in CCD. There are other structural abnormalities, suchas blood vessel substances, including lipofuscinand ubiquitin. Mitochondrial dysfunction also plays a role. 39 The clinical signs for CCD may resemble other intracranial diseases. The acronym DISHAA has been historically used for thecategories of clinical signs seen with cognitive dysfunction: Disorien- tation, alterations in social Interactions, changes in Sleep-wake cycles, loss of House training and other learned behaviors, altered Activity levels, and increased Anxiety. In dogs, the most common clinical signs include daytime sleeping and nighttime restlessness,decreased interaction, disorientation at home, and anxiety. In a morerecent study, it was found that visual impairment, smell disturbance,tremors, and falling down are associated with the diagnosis of CCDand may help clients and veterinarians recognize early CCD. 41Other clinical signs of note include lack of recognition of and interactionwith familiar people and objects, loss of house training, losses inbehavioral training, appetite changes, and compulsion or pacing. 41 Clinical signs in cats are similar, although cats tend to have anincrease in interaction and vocalization compared with dogs. 42Anxi- ety has been recognized as a signi cant component of this disorder that should not be overlooked.43 Cognitive dysfunction may be a diagnosis of exclusion. A thor- ough history, physical examination, neurological examination,biochemical evaluation, and urinalysis are integral to ensure theseanimals do not have other underlying disease causing similar clinicalsigns. Neurological examination may be consistent with forebraindysfunction, with evidence of dementia and compulsion. An MRIof the brain is recommended to rule out structural disease. Otherdifferentials for similar behavior changes may include intracranialneoplasia, pain, and organ dysfunction. 39Certain MRI changes are suggestive of cognitive dysfunction, such as reduction in mass of theinterthalamic adhesion and cerebrocortical atrophy, although nd- ings should be correlated with clinical signs. 44 To mitigate the underdiagnosis of cognitive dysfunction, speci c and directed questions can be used as markers.40,42Multiple ques- tionnaires exist that can be used as both diagnostic and monitoringtools. 45,46These canine cognitive dysfunction/QOL questionnaires2023 AAHA Senior Care Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 7TABLE 2 Diagnostic Approaches by Body System for Senior Dogs and Cats Body System Diagnostic Approach Therapeutic Tip Integument PE focus: Identify, describe, and map skin lesions, i.e., prurit us, alopecia.

Evidence suggests that management and treatment of cogni- tive dysfunction are most effective when started early, highlighting the importance of early recognition of cognitive impairment by the veterinary team. Although many therapies have been studied for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction, selegiline, a selective irre- versible monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, is the only drug labeled for use for canine cognitive dysfunction. Selegiline is dosed at 0.5 -1 mg/kg once a day OR every 24 hr. in the morning for 30 days, at which point the dose can be adjusted up to the next tablet size if there is no improvement at the lower dose. Selegiline is effective in up to 70% of dogs with cognitive dysfunction.48Toxicity can occur if selegiline is used in conjunction with other antidepressants, nar- cotics, phenylpropanolamine, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Newer treatments are being investigated and may be available in the future, such as a butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor.49 Certain diets, especially those high in antioxidants and medium chain triglycerides, have also been posited for the treatment of this condition. These diets showed the most positive effect when com- bined with environmental enrichment (exercise, new toys, cognitive games, tasks, agility). The quality and rigor of the research associated with other various supplements, nutraceuticals, acupuncture, anddiets is limited. 39,50,51 Anxiety is a clinical sign associated with CCD that may be directly treated. Anxiety has been recognized to signi cantly compro- mise the QOL of both the pet and family.43It is a complex syndrome and can also be related to chronic pain. Chronic pain -related anxiety is recognized in human cognitive dysfunction.52The treatment of pain, along with anxiolytics and antidepressants for anxiety, should be considered in the cognitively impaired patient. Various anxiolytics and antidepressants can be considered.53Diazepam has been reported to exacerbate dementia signs in humans.54There are FDA-approved drugs licensed for dogs for noise phobia and separation anxiety (e.g., clomipramine) but not speci cally for anxiety associated with CCD. Shorter-acting drugs such as trazodone and alprazolam are preferred by the task force because of their rapid onset and clearance from the body, as well as their very limited side-effect pro le. Pain Management Identifying, preventing, and minimizing pain are essential in the senior patient. The 2022 AAHA Pain Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats and the 2021 AAFP Feline Senior Care Guidelinesoutline speci c, comprehensive recommendations for pain assess- ment and management.3,12 Clients often perceive changes in their geriatric pets as normal aging when it may be the result of clinical chronic pain. Clients may not perceive that changes in behavior or in vital signs can indicate pain, especially when chronic pain behavior changes may be subtle. Educating clients about how to recognize and monitor acute and chronic pain should be paramount for the veterinary team. Clients can take videos of their animal moving and interacting with their environment. Videos are useful for the client and the practitioner to evaluate changes in movement and can be used to monitor responses to medications and therapies. This may help large-breed dogs withdegenerative joint disease and cats who, owing to subtle changes in behavior, may not have their chronic pain recognized. 55 Treatment options for managing pain and mobility must be integrative and multimodal. Addressing these issues early in the course of the disease improves outcome. Pain management may include the use of pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, herbals, weight management, acupuncture, physical modalities, and environmental modi cations. Senior pets with chronic musculoskeletal disease may also bene t from physical rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is an excellent option for assisting with pain management and increasing mobility and balance. Rehabilitation may use different therapies to reduce pain and increase the QOL, including exercise therapy, hydrother- apy, acupuncture, manual therapy, and modalities such as photobio- modulation therapy, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and pulsedelectromagnetic eld therapy. 55 Counseling clients on home modi cation and pet accessories to increase the mobility and QOL of the pet may include appropriate use of ramps, suitable placement and design of litter boxes, elevation of food and water bowls, use of rugs or yoga mats to provide better footing, tted and padded harnesses to aid with lifting larger pets, toe grips, boots, and socks for foot stability, medical pet shirts for anxiety, and the use of appropriate beds. As senior pets may have limited vision or hearing, identifying potential hazards in the home and yard such as stairs or pools should be included when discussing senior care with clients. Special Disease Consideration: GOLPP Complex Environmental changes may be helpful for dogs who have developedGOLPP complex, which has been increasingly recognized in geriatric large-breed dogs (Labrador retrievers and associated breeds). This condition causes degeneration of long nerves in the body, particu- larly the laryngeal and sciatic nerves, causing laryngeal paralysis and weakness of the pelvic limbs with conscious proprioception de cits. Clinical signs include exercise intolerance, upper airway 12 JAAHA | 59:1 Jan/Feb 2023weakness, and sarcopenia. Comorbidities may include and pain. Treatment may include main-taining QOL with laryngeal tie-back surgery and physical therapy topreserve muscle mass. Pain management should be included in thetreatment plan. 56Clients should be counseled that heat stroke may be a complication in this subgroup of patients.57 Disease Management: Nutritional Changes to nutrition may be useful in the management of disease for the senior dog or cat and have been used for conditions such ashyperthyroidism, chronic kidney disease, osteoarthritis, and diabetesmellitus. Different ingredients in a balanced diet may be used to treator manage a chronic disease; for example, adding antioxidants to thediet of dogs and cats may help manage conditions such as cognitivedysfunction syndrome, immunosenescence, osteoarthritis, and heartdisease. 58-60Long-chain omega-3 flammatory effects in osteoar- thritis,61-64and medium-chain triglycerides have been recommended for cognitive dysfunction syndrome.65For cats with diabetes mellitus, treating for issues such as obesity and inactivity is known to be bene-cial to managing the disease. A dietary change to a high-protein (.45% on dry-weight basis) and low-carbohydrate ( ,15%) diet given in small frequent meals may help minimize postprandial glu-cose in flux. 66 For patients with renal disease, studies have shown that a renal diet with restrictive protein provides longer survival times with feweruremic crises for patients. 67IRIS currently recommends phosphorus control with a reduction in intake and addition of binders.68At IRIS stage 2, the addition of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fattyacids is suggested. Healthy pets and early renal cases should notrequire protein restriction, and quality and quantity should be care-fully managed in later IRIS stages. Protein restriction is to be consid-ered at IRIS stage 2 and recommended at IRIS stage 3. For cats with hyperthyroidism, clinical concerns include weight loss and LBM loss, and a high-protein ( .40%), limited-carbohydrate (,25%) diet while restricting iodine is recommended. 66,69Fish- based diets should be avoided. Dogs that have developed hypothy-roidism may require a diet that has restricted calories. Palliative care patients may be hyporexic or anorexic. Focus may need to be shifted from a balanced diet to just getting the ani- mal to eat something. For palliative patients that are enteralor parenteral feeding (e.g., esophagostomy or percutaneous endo-scopic gastrostomy tubes to reduce food aversion) should be dis-cussed with the client. Feeding tubes can also be bene cial for giving parenteral medication, the amount of which may be substantial inthe end-of-life patient. Appetite stimulants, medication for nauseaand vomiting, and careful fluid administration should be providedfor hyporexic or anorexic patients. 70Resumption of favorite foods, even if not medically balanced, may provide some nutrition with a more positive experience for both the caregiver and patient. End of Life and Euthanasia The 2016 AAHA/IAAHPC End-of-Life Care Guidelines provide detailed recommendations for maximizing patient comfort and mini- mizing suffering while providing a collaborative and supportive part- nership with the caregiver client.71For many clients, as their senior pet develops chronic progressive disease or a terminal illness, the events and veterinary care surrounding their pet 'snal life stage are signicant. Palliative Care or Hospice? T h eo p t i o no fp a l l i a t i v ec a r es h o u l db eo f f e r e dt ot h ec l i e n tw h e nt h e r e is a chronic, progressive, or terminal diagnosis. Palliative care consists of symptom and pain management that can be provided along with curative treatment. Palliative care develops a plan and provides guid- ance for the family in symptom and disease management, pain man- agement, and physical or rehabilitation therapy, which helps minimize the suffering of patients regardless of life stage. If a client is facing an end-of-life decision for their pet, hospice, which is the end stage of palliative care, can be considered.72Hospice provides services in addition to palliative care to later-stage, termi- nally ill patients and their families, such as planning for the decline of the pet with their particular disease, dealing with a crisis that may arise, and how the family would like the animal to die, such as by euthanasia or a palliated death from their disease. Regardless of the disease stage, the clients are empowered to care for their pet, spend quality time with their pet, and deal with anticipatory grief. For palliative or hospice pets and their families, discussing disease trajectories and the clinical signs of approaching and imminent death is important. A daily and crisis plan should be developed with the goals of providing ongoing care for the patient and support for the family. Finally, a discussion of the plan for death, whether it be euthanasia or palliated death, is needed. If a palliated death is chosen, the use of palli- ative sedation should be discussed. If euthanasia is the choice, theoptions could be presented at the initial consultation and further dis- cussed in future follow-up appointments. Clients may opt for a home euthanasia service as these have become more readily available. The Initial Appointment The initial palliative appointment should occur early in the course of the disease. There is research on the human side of palliative care that indicates starting early increases the quality and the quantity of life. 73Palliative care may be basic, such as symptom management, to advanced level care, including multiple comorbidities and more2023 AAHA Senior Care Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 13advanced pain and symptom management. The introductory end-of- life appointments may be longer than the average appointment, with some palliative practitioners using up to 3 hr for a single appoint- ment. Listening to clients about their goals, fears, and worries and then educating them about end-of-life care takes time. It is key to dening the client 's goals of care and maximizing the QOL of the patient. Compassionate, advanced serious disease communication may reduce the likelihood of premature or dif cult euthanasia events. The palliative appointment may begin with an in-depth conver- sation around the client 's understanding of the history, diagnosis, and current medications of their pet and then develop a plan basedon the client 's goals of care. After a thorough discussion regarding history, a complete physical examination with pain assessment would be the next step. After that, the diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical out- comes of chronic disease or end-stage organ dysfunction can be dis- cussed. A plan can then be developed based on the client 's goals of care and may proceed to a discussion of palliative care, hospice, or humane euthanasia options. Veterinarians may explore a client 's fears, beliefs, and physical abilities necessary to be an effective care- giver. The clinician and client may use different tools to determine goals of care, and what the pet will or can tolerate may in fluence end-of-life decisions. Tools for End-of-Life Care Equipping clients with tools to use to evaluate their pet, such as vali- dated pain scales, validated QOL scales, advanced directives, and clinical signs of imminent death, may help the client with their goals of care. QOL is a subjective perception and may be unique to the cli- ent and in fluenced by the bond they share with the pet. However, using a validated QOL scale may help the client have a more objec- tive view of their pet 's condition. As of this writing, there are very few validated QOL scales for the animal patient. Most QOL scales found online are not currently validated. 74Clients may also track good versus bad days on a calendar or journal to get a more objective and accurate view of changes. There are now apps that may also be useful in tracking changes like respiratory rate. Checking In Clients may need additional time to process the initial conversation, and further discussion may need to occur at a different time. If a cli- ent seems overwhelmed with information, schedule another time to continue the discussion. Veterinarians that have an open approach to the conversation, acknowledge the client 's goals or ideas, and bal- ance the discussion with QOL may develop a deeper connection with the client, improving client compliance.Limitations on Palliative Care The veterinarian should also recognize the limitations of the client in providing nursing care for their pet. In addition, having a frank dis-cussion about the nancial, physical, emotional, and time implica- tions of different end-of-life care options may help the client come to a collaborative decision regarding end of life and their choiceregarding euthanasia. Advanced age is not the only criterion formaking medical decisions and does not preclude surgeries or other signicant medical interventions depending on the goals of the client and the condition of the patient. Clinical scenarios that may affectQOL and in fluence decision making for the client may include anorexia, symptom progression, severe or unrelenting chronic pain, deterioration of a condition during active treatment, persistent cougheven at rest, cognitive dysfunction progression, and mobility issues. The Veterinary Team in End-of-Life Care The veterinary team can guide clients to decisions by advocating for both the senior pet and client. The veterinary team includes the veteri- narian, credentialed technicians, veterinary assistants, and client servicerepresentatives. Additional team members that may help with end-of-life care can include mental health professionals and grief counselors, pharmacies, compounding pharmacies, groomers, pet sitters, respite workers, spiritual leaders, and end-of-life care specialists. Although theclient is generally the best advocate for the pet, veterinary teams may help guide them toward the best decision for both the pet and family. Making a decision for a beloved pet is complex, and empathy andunderstanding on the part of the veterinary team to support the client 's psychological, spiritual, and emotional beliefs is optimal. Veterinarians and other clinical staff may experience physical or compassion fatigue when dealing with patients with multiple medicalconcerns or undiagnosed diseases. Maintaining a positive outlook,such as a combination of celebrating senior pets and sharing suc- cesses with clients and team members, may help boost morale for everyone involved in the care of the pet. Clients can also experience fatigue, which can be minimized or prevented with activities such as creating a joy-of-living list, creating a bucket list, setting up pet dates, and maintaining the sacred human-animal bond that emphasizes QOL for the pet and theirfamilies. Making Senior Patients a Practice Priority Senior pets make up 44% of the pet population. This demographicshould encourage veterinary practices to expand their focus on thesenior pet and their family. There are several ways practices can encourage families to bring their senior pets into the clinic and a vast number of tools that can be implemented in the clinic to make sure itis a safe and enjoyable visit for all involved. Creating a senior-friendly 14 JAAHA | 59:1 Jan/Feb 2023hospital may include changing pheromones, developing questionnaires and checklists speci - cally for senior pets, scheduling longer appointment times, developing Senior Care Kits, and expanding end-of-life care tools and practices. Creating a Senior-Friendly Hospital Creating a Senior Pet Champions team that develops senior care standard operating procedures and is proactive in identifying areasf o ri m p r o v i n gt h es e n i o rc a r ee x p e r i e n c ec a nc r e a t eap r a c t i c ec u l t u r ethat emphasizes optimum care for older pets. This approach willnot only inspire more families to bring their senior pets to yourpractice but also ensure these patients are treated with the bestcare possible. Evaluating the Physical Space for Senior Patients When developing a plan for a senior-friendly hospital, consider the physical components of the clinic that may be a challenge to theaging pet. Is the pet able to walk up to and into the building easily?Do the floors support senior pets? Are the senior cats kept in a calm area away from dogs, and are they able to be comfortable during their visit? What is the noise level in the lobby, examination rooms, and treatment area? The exterior of the veterinary practice should be examined, including the parking lot, for obstacles the senior pet may need toovercome. For example, are there a few steps (or a curb) to climb toget to the entrance? Even one step up may be a struggle for an olderdog, and installing appropriate ramps can increase ease of access tothe front door of the practice. Flooring in the lobby, examinationrooms, and treatment area should also be assessed, and, if necessary,bathmats or yoga mats can be used to accommodate the senior pet.Consider covering scales and tables with similar mats so that theolder dog or cat will have better grip and feel more comfortable.Senior pets may have noise and light sensitivities, and adjusting light-ing and installing noise dampening tiles for walls could help. Phero- mone sprays in the examination rooms and the lobby may also help to relax anxious animals. Senior pets who require treatment or hospitalization require good traction in the kennels and cages, additional padding in therecovery areas, decreased stress handling, suf cient warmth, and minimal noise in treatment and surgical recovery areas. Planning for the Senior Pet 's Appointment Providing a senior pet owner a questionnaire to ll out before a visit can help clients focus on behavior and note changes they may be see-ing with their senior pet. When a family schedules an appointment,provide a species-speci c senior pet questionnaire. Instructions on taking video of pets can be included, and clients can be asked to takepictures and videos displaying mobility and any abnormal behaviorseen at home. In addition, images of the pet 's food and water area and sleeping environment may also be helpful. When booking the appointment, enough time must be allocated for the veterinarian to properly give a thorough examination and assessment of the pet. Extra time will be needed to discuss disease conditions, environmental adjustment suggestions, medical therapies, and family goals for the patient. It is helpful to also include a discus- sion about the progression of the ailments and diseases the family is managing. This will help establish expectations early in the senior care process and assist with decision making later. At the conclusion of the appointment, the client should be given handouts with detailed information that may include diagnosed disease(s), details on medications dispensed (or recom-mended), and speci c product recommendations and recommenda- tions for follow-up care. The veterinary team should actively educate the client to avoid dismissing certain age-related changes as merely \"old age, \"a catch-all phrase that inadequately addresses the speci c and often treatable conditions affecting the senior dog or cat. Avoid just discussing the need for biannual diagnostics to uncover hidden diseases with clients. Instead, focus on all the expert care, ideas, and support the hospital will provide to ensure their senior pet 's quality and quantity of life. After each healthcare visit, provide the client with patient-speci c written information and instructions because appointments can sometimes involve informa- tion overload. Senior Care Kits Many clinics have puppy or kitten kits available for new pet families but do not offer a Senior Care Kit for families of the senior patient. A client with a senior pet may have as many issues and questions as someone with a new puppy or kitten. To create a Senior Care Kit forboth dogs and cats, consider the following contents: /C15Customized healthcare and product recommendations /C15Information on common senior pet diseases, such as chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, neoplasia, cognitive dysfunction, mobility changes, and chronic pain /C15Medication information for their pet 's prescriptions, including dis- pensing instructions, pill-giving tips, and side effects to watch for /C15Information on chronic versus acute pain recognition and detection (include visual aid of the practice 's preferred validated chronic and acute pain scales) /C15Speci c nutritional recommendations for their pet, including visual information about body condition score and muscle condition score /C15Cognitive dysfunction questionnaire /C15Tumor/skin maps /C15Changes that clients could make in their home, which may include elevating food bowls, keeping pets safe with barriers and gates, alertsor alarms in areas where they can get into trouble (e.g., pools andstairs), yoga mats and carpet runners, ramps, and bedding in accessi-ble areas2023 AAHA Senior Care Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 15/C15Changes that can help with mobility: toe grips and boots, harnesses for mobility, relocating a dog 's play or resting area closer to the door, and lower litter boxes for cats /C15Changes to decrease stress in the home: use of pheromone sprays, temperature control, access to sunlight, nightlights, sound machines, and front door signs to ask guests not to ring the doorbell /C15Bucket and joys-of-living lists /C15Checklist of local senior-friendly/recommended pet sitters, gentle groomers, daycare and boarding facilities, and local and online sup- port groups /C15Validated QOL assessments and scale /C15Information about caregiver burden and caregiver support resources /C15Anticipatory grief, pet loss, and grief information, including a crisis phone number and website /C15Veterinary palliative care and hospice information A Senior Care Kit will help clients support their senior pet and improve QOL. Other useful tools could include encouraging clients to take pictures and videos of their pets within a speci ed time (i.e., daily, weekly, or monthly) to help the client and the veterinariantrack body condition changes, mobility, joyful activities, and other behaviors associated with the senior life stage. Having clients see these changes over time will help them better assess QOL as the pet 's disease progresses. It is helpful to provide families of older pets with a checklist of what to look for (and what to avoid) regarding appropriate pet sitters, pet loss support groups, gentle groomers, senior hotels, and boardingfacilities (e.g., in-home boarding staff who can administer medicationsto the pet). If the primary caregiver is going to be out of town or unavailable, the client should have a letter given to the pet sitter that includes a phone number for the client; the time zone they will be in;who the pet sitter is and an authorization for them to make decisions;how the client is going to pay for any services rendered in case of emergency; and a designated family member, friend, or other repre- sentative who is authorized to make healthcare decisions for the pet. Keep in mind that not all clients are able to come into the clinic. It may be a good idea to have the essential senior care resour-ces, tools, and information readily available on your website. Promoting Senior Care in the Veterinary Practice Practices with a focus on senior care can promote their expertise through their practice website and social media. Topics can include mobility issues, cognition changes, chronic pain, elimination behav-ior and incontinence, and changes in hearing and vision. Informa-tion on common diseases that clients may see in their senior pet, along with the common clinical signs, could be provided on the web- site or social media. Home tips, product recommendations, videos,and pictures of what the chronic or terminal disease might look likeand when to visit the veterinarian may also be added. The hospital website should promote what the practice does dif- ferently for senior pets. For example, longer appointments, specialflooring, and assistance with getting the pet in and out of the car are all valued services the practice can add to the senior care experience. Videos of the changes the hospital has made to become senior friendly may also be a good addition to the website. An end-of-life care section can be developed that may include a QOL assessment, pain management with validated tools, information about caregiver burden, and pet loss and grief resources. Clinic websites often focus on puppy and kitten pictures \u2014a practice can stand out as senior friendly by ensuring that senior pets make up at least 30% of the visual content of the hospital 'sw e b s i t e . Managing the Caregiver Burden Caring for a senior pet takes time, patience, money, and emotional and often physical stamina. It can take an emotional and physical toll on the caregivers and lead to caregiver burden. Practices can sup- port clients by developing an education program on caregiver bur- den. The hospital may alleviate some of the load by helping the client in several ways \u2014for example, providing a Senior Care Kit with lists of people who may be able to provide pet sitting or respite care, offering options for medications that are easier to administer (e.g., using compounding pharmacies to create palatable medications), providing a veterinary technician or assistant to help with the daily care of the pet, and, in some cases, limiting medical treatment to what is essential. Conflicts in the home regarding the pet 's behavioral changes, nancial constraints, emotional guilt, stress, or disputes with partners or family regarding care of the pet may add to the caregiver burden. Providing information on coping mechanisms to caregivers, includ- ing resources for accessing mental health professionals, social work- ers, counselors, and psychologists, in Senior Care Kits can be helpful. Honesty and openness about the care that may be required for the senior patient currently and in the future is paramount. Developing a plan together with the client that recognizes and works within their limitations is the best course of action for limiting caregiver burden. For example, if the dog is panting and pacing all night, suggesting a dental cleaning may not be the best thing to focus on \u2014even if it is the most medically relevant issue to treat. Alleviating sleep disturban- cesrst may relieve caregiver stress and then allow the client to focus on other medical concerns. Communicating with Families of Senior Pets Families with senior pets may come into the examination visit with differing goals and beliefs. Getting people on the same path may take some work. Interactions with each individual in the family may mean longer appointment times to hear out different perspectives and work on empathizing with and validating their feelings. Senior pets may have a long list of issues that can complicate the visit. 16 JAAHA | 59:1 Jan/Feb 2023Developing tools to start a conversation among the family members that centers the needs of the pet and takes their concerns intoaccount is a good place to start. News of a declining condition or serious illness is common in geriatric medicine, so careful use of communication is essential. Howthe patient 's condition is explained and the goals of care are estab- lished with the client may have a great impact on the animal 'sc a r e and the client 's experience. Listening to the client 's understanding of the condition and eliciting how much detail they prefer can be estab-lished before continuing the conversation. Be aware of unintendedbias in these discussions. Clients may have many questions. For example, they may want to know if there was a cause of the illness, how serious it is, andwhat are the expected outcomes in the short and long term. Studies have shown that truth is important, delivered clearly with compas- sion and without judgment. 75Use a comfortable area in the practice free from distractions to maintain focus on the interaction.Information should be given in bits with pauses to assess the client 's understanding before moving on to the next topic. Visuals or linksto written materials may be offered to the client for them to refer tolater, especially in situations in which emotions may hinder informa-tion processing. Providing them with a plan for follow-up questionsand resources may be necessary. 75 When there is a large amount of information to convey to a cli- ent, grouping it into categories aids recall. For example, \"The four main goals of our therapy are to (1) reduce pain, (2) increase mobil-ity, (3) get to a healthy weight, and (4) help you two enjoy thosewalks on the nature path again. \"Tailoring information to the unique situation of the client and pet is important. 76Work with the client to prioritize medications by importance and anticipate dosing challenges or missed doses. Involve the client in problem solving and developing a mutually acceptable plan. This is another opportunity to identify what medications or nutraceuticals are being given and to call attention to possible adverse effects if administered concurrently with prescribed medications. When dis- pensing medications, make sure the names of the medications are discussed along with the bene ts, expected outcomes, and potential side effects. Repeat and summarize the medical recommendations, and then check to con rm that the caregiver agrees with the plan and questions have been addressed. Finally, schedule a follow-uptime to check in and re-evaluate how the medications are working and how the client and pet are adjusting to the new plan. Using Telehealth and Telemedicine Technologies Veterinary practices are increasingly using online technologies to gather and disseminate patient information. These developments have encouraged innovations that can enhance care, increase ef - ciency, and expand access. Familiarization with the de nitions and types of technological medicine and adherence to state, province, and national practice, licensure, and pharmacy law is essential. Many states require an in-person veterinarian-client-patient relationship to be established rst. The practice should ascertain security issues, pro- tect client privacy, and allow for secure transactions. Notes and record keeping must be maintained as required by law. Check with your liability carrier to ensure coverage on planned activities. The2021 AAHA-AVMA Telehealth Guidelines for Small Animal Practice provide a detailed resource for implementing telehealth serv- ices in a veterinary practice. 77The components of an effective Home Tips for Clients Caring for Senior Pets \u0081Provide regular gentle grooming and nail care \u0081Consider having a mobile groomer for home grooming to minimize stress \u0081Keep pets clean and dry at all times, including fur, skin, and bedding \u0081Provide good bedding that is adequately padded \u0081Cover slippery floors with secure rugs and mats for traction \u0081Pets with decreased mobility need additional nursing care, including being walked or turned every few hours \u0081Monitor skin for redness, rashes, swelling \u0081Keep flies, fleas, and ticks off the senior pet \u0081For pets with incontinence issues: /H17034Minimize use of diapers to avoid secondary infections /H17034Use disposable or washable waterproof covers for bedding (fleece or mesh) /H17034Keep patient groomed and/or fur trimmed, particularly on the back legs, tail, and around the vulva, penis, and anus /H17034Use baby wipes or medicated wipes to keep patient clean in between bathing2023 AAHA Senior Care Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 17telehealth component in companion animal practice are shown in Figure 1, Components of Telehealth in Small-Animal Practice. Telehealth can be especially helpful for the senior patient by increasing access to care in situations where caregivers may have dis-abilities, challenges with transportation or time off from work, orhome care obligations or need consultations with specialists. Thes e n i o rp e tt h a ti sd i f cult to transport, anxious, painful, or fragile may be examined in less time and for less risk using telehealthresources. For the practice, telemedicine care can save time andexpense, decrease appointment congestion, and improve work flow and ultimately work-life balance. Some practices allow clinicians touse a work-from-home option, which may expand hours and use afee-for-service arrangement. Having high-quality rechecks more frequently can improve patient outcomes by assessing response to therapy, progression ofsigns, healing of lesions, and any barriers to adherence. Access tocurrent electronic patient data can facilitate better discussion, com-munication, and cooperation between those involved in the care. 78 Video appointments may be used to gather background infor- mation before a clinical procedure or for a follow-up visit, especiallywith palliative or hospice care. The patient can be featured on cam-era to allow assessment of progress in pain control, movement, orwound healing. Often home environments allow a truer picture ofthe animal 'sb e h a v i o r . Telemedicine examinations require planning to ensure compli- ance with state practice acts and optimal capture of accuratediagnostic information. Clinicians should always be mindful of the limits of telemedicine and provide informed consent for pet owners.Challenges may arise with the quality of images, the accuracy of thedescription of the concern, missed symptoms or physical cues, anddiagnosis without diagnostic testing. Breaches of privacy, ransom-ware, or malfunctions are additional concerns. 79Clarity on the scope of care should be addressed with the caregiver during the visit, alongwith advice to follow up in person as needed. Teleconsultation with specialists can aid patient care when spe- cialty practices are hard to access. Check with your practice actregarding advice obtained from a veterinarian from out of state.Reports and information also may be transmitted by photo, audio,or recorded video methods. Clients may become more engaged incare with this real-time information and be more attuned to signi - cant changes. Pet wearable technology is rapidly expanding and may allow real-time monitoring of the senior pet. Smartphone apps that moni-tor pet health and activity are being developed and may furthertransform practice. Frequent inputs of blood glucose, weight, or car-diac abnormalities may enhance understanding of the patient 's condition and allow for improved treatment outcomes. Pain man-agement may be improved with future arti cial intelligence apps that can assess pain expressions and other aspects of movement. How-ever, it is important to note that telehealth and telemedicine innova-tions are intended to augment, but not replace, in-person care. Educating the Veterinary Team Education of the veterinary team is vital if the practice wishes to pro- v i d et h eb e s tp o s s i b l es e n i o rc a r e .A g i n gp e t so f t e nr e q u i r es p e c i a lnursing care because of changes in both physical and mental abilities.If the healthcare team can recognize and address health issues thatcan in fluence the course of treatment, disease management, patient care, and outcomes will improve. Formal training for the veterinary team should involve educa- tion on the process of aging, senior pet -friendly techniques, and modi cation of the clinic environment to suit the needs of the pet. If the staff understands that senior pets may be frail, both physicallyand mentally, simple actions such as prolonging appointment timesfor senior pets or offering gentle holding techniques can be bene cial for the pet and the client. If the team understands the aging process, then they are better able to counsel the client on how to managetheir pets. Every team member should be familiar with the commonsymptoms of aging and invest time in learning how these changeswill affect their patients. Low-stress handling and providing morecomfort measures for the senior pet are important in relieving anxi-ety and making senior visits safe and rewarding for the caregiver andpatient alike. 80,81 FIGURE 1 Components of Practice 18 JAAHA | 59:1 Jan/Feb 2023The veterinary team should be aware of other methods for opti- mum senior pet care, including: /C15Examination rooms can be repurposed into senior care rooms with the addition of yoga mats to prevent slippage; cushions and low beds for physical comfort; and natural light, soft music, and appro- priate pheromone scents for the patients to relieve anxiety, soothe the patient and the caregiver, and help to relieve pain. /C15The use of a senior pet questionnaire can help to prioritize the goals of the caregiver as well as the veterinary focus for the examination. /C15The senior care room should contain materials about caring for senior pets that can be quickly and easily shared with the caregiver. /C15Treating larger patients on the floor and performing most tasks and sample collections in the room in the presence of the caregiver canease anxiety and increase comfort. /C15If the patient requires hospitalization, ensure comfort and safety for the duration of the hospital stay. Mesh beds can be used to keep incontinent pets dry, and warm blankets and items from home can comfort hospitalized seniors. /C15Updating the caregiver regularly on the status of the patient helps build trust and reduce anxiety for the client. 80 The caregiver-pet bond is unique to all animals, and veterinary teams should recognize that this bond means different things to differ- ent people. Practitioners should work with clients to make sure the animal is not suffering, as sometimes families have dif culty letting go of a pet at the end of life. Teams should be educated on how to recog- nize and anticipate bereavement and grief. Support should be provided for team members who work in emotionally charged situations andmay feel overtaxed or take on the pain clients are feeling. Veterinary team members should be encouraged to seek help when needed. 80 Summary All companion animal practices should ascribe special status to the senior patient because these clients usually have a very strong, long- term relationship with their pets. Many families of senior pets place an intrinsic value on their animals as personal companions and fam-ily members. Senior pet care presents an opportunity for a practice to implement optimum and individualized healthcare for its geriatric patient population. The onset of the senior life stage differs somewhat for dogs and cats and within breeds for both species. A thorough diagnostic assessment as described in the Guidelines will help the practitioner determine the speci c needs of the senior pet. The senior pet 's healthcare plan can then be differentiated into evidence-guided pro- tocols for the healthy and unhealthy patient. Using this approach, senior pet care becomes a carefully staged healthcare plan designedto preserve and extend the patient 's QOL and maintain a strong, active relationship between the pet and family. Practices that adopt a proactive senior pet health care philosophy can educate clients thatthe aging process is not an inevitable physical, mental, and behav- ioral decline that warrants minimal medical intervention.Practices that successfully emphasize senior pet wellness should focus on two aspects of the practice 'sc u l t u r e \u2014team training to pro- mote senior pet care and client education to explain the practice 's healthcare recommendations for the senior pet. When both the prac-tice team and the practice 's clients understand the goals for senior pet care, successfully implementing an effective healthcare programfor older pets is all but ensured.
