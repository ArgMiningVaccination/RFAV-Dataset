Having come from very humble beginnings, Vivian was aware of health disparities and socioeconomic-related issues early on. Her early experiences inspired and motivated her to go into medicine to help serve others in unfortunate positions. She graduated from St. John's University with both a bachelor's and master's degrees in Chemistry. In 2014, she became involved with a non-profit organization called Mentoring in Medicine (MIM), which provides many opportunities for underrepresented students who are interested in pursuing a career in the health professions. Vivian started off as a volunteer in their Emergency Department Clinical Exposure and Mentorship Program. Her time volunteering at Montefiore Medical Center gave her the chance to engage with patients and witness the daily practice of ER physicians in an overcrowded ED. She was able to interact with patients who were struggling with chronic ailments and/or language barriers. Having worked through a disadvantaged background with immigrant parents herself, she empathized and developed a strong desire to help those in need. She then got involved with MIM in another capacity, community outreach and raising awareness of health disparities in the Bronx. She assisted with organizing fitness festivals in the community and other events that promoted preventive medicine through daily lifestyle changes. Most recently, she taught Biology to Bronx high school students as part of an in-school program, introducing various health professions, and performing relevant demonstrations in academic settings. Vivian is passionate about community outreach and has goals of creating a life-long mentorship program targeted at minority youth. A self-described fitness junkie, Vivian is always looking for healthy ways to take her body to the next level. Lifting weights, or riding her bike through each of the five boroughs are some of the things she enjoys doing in her spare time. Vivian is excited to become a part of the Urban Health Scholars and is confident that she will be able to integrate her training at Geisel, her passion for teaching and mentoring, and her communication skills to maximize health care delivery and raise awareness in urban, underserved populations. Cynthia Chan - 2021 After being a satellite baby in China for her first four years of life, Cynthia rejoined her parents in her birthplace (NYC), where she eventually also lived with her maternal grandparents and younger sister. Together, they moved from Section 8 housing into a home more of their own. Having spent over 5.5 formative years in Asia, Cynthia identifies as a 1.5th generation immigrant. In high school, she served as a local politician's constituent aid and helped other immigrants with various concerns. She continued her social work during college, primarily by working with underserved adults in New Haven and China to address their social determinants of health, including socioeconomic class, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, employment history, and (dis)ability status. While majoring in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, Cynthia engaged with more macro-level public and global health classes and experiences, both locally and internationally. Between Yale and Geisel, Cynthia served as a Fulbright researcher and cultural ambassador to China, where she interviewed hundreds of metal miners for an occupational health cohort. These and other experiences have informed her goal to serve indigent people and populations through medicine, and her desire both to do good and to do well. Cynthia joined UHS (and Global Health Fellows) to share and support that goal and desire. At Dartmouth, she hopes to gain the skills, experiences, and relationships necessary to become--What kind of doctor?--a good doctor (and scholar). Cynthia also enjoys traveling, eating, trying new things, oil painting, bowling, listening to some podcasts, and watching certain films. Most of all, she enjoys spending time with people she cares about. Laura J. Cheng - 2021 Laura grew up in Troy, Michigan. As a second-generation Chinese-American, she learned to speak English and Mandarin starting from a young age. For high school, she attended the International Academy in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan before moving to Cambridge, Massachusetts to attend Harvard University. Laura graduated from Harvard in 2015, majoring in Neurobiology and minoring in Global Health & Health Policy. During college, she completed an honors thesis at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the Shanghai Mental Health Center, which examined differences in the default mode network between healthy controls and youth at risk for schizophrenia in a Chinese population. Outside of research, Laura has been involved in multiple volunteer activities in the Boston area. Throughout college, she tutored GED/HiSet test preparation weekly at the South Bay House of Corrections, a medium-security prison, and volunteered with Health Leads, where she helped connect low-income patients with social resources in the community in attempt to address the social determinants of health. Following graduation, Laura worked for two years as a Research Coordinator at the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Women's Mental Health while continuing to work with incarcerated populations as a tutor and health educator. As a physician, she plans to work with urban underserved communities, including incarcerated and immigrant communities, to help reduce existing health disparities. Diana Funk - 2021 Diana hails from the small town of Perkasie, Pennsylvania. Born at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, she returned to Penn for college, receiving a degree from Wharton in Economics with a concentration in Healthcare Policy in 2010. At Penn she was involved in community service throughout West Philadelphia and taught business essentials to high school students. After graduation she moved to the golden state of California to work for Google in People Operations and communications. While in San Francisco she worked with the WATCH Clinic, teaching nutrition to at-risk children and their families. She also worked with the city of San Francisco to design an application for affordable housing using user-centered design. After completing a post-bacc program at UC Berkeley, she came to Geisel where she hopes to learn more about the challenges that urban populations face -- be it healthcare, nutrition, education, access, or inequality, and discover new ways to address those problems through service and policy. J Gresham - 2021 Chad Lewis - 2021 Chad originally hails from San Francisco, CA. Shortly after graduating from high school, he enlisted in the Marine Corps a few weeks after the attacks on Sept. 11th, 2001 and eventually earned the rank of Sergeant. While serving, Chad completed a combat tour with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) in Iraq's infamous \"Triangle of Death\" from 2004 to 2005, and was also awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal by the Department of Defense for providing relief to the victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, LA. After returning home, Chad completed his B.S. at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and left the Marines in 2007 to work as a field engineer in the homeland security and telecommunications industries for a number of years. Most recently before matriculating at Geisel, he worked under the 17th Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. Richard H. Carmona while conducting public health research and managing multiple health promotion programs in low-income communities across the country. While there, he concurrently completed his Master of Public Health at The George Washington University in the spring of 2016, and was a recipient of the Andrew F. Pleasant Scholarship for Advanced Studies in Health Literacy and Prevention. Chad is currently a member of the Student National Medical Association (SNMA)'s National Board of Directors and is a Co-Chair of SNMA's External Affairs Committee. His long-term career goals are to practice medicine in urban underserved communities while being a leader in the fields of public health, veterans' health, and youth development. Sandra G. Mastrangelo - 2021 Sand was raised in White Plains, New York and graduated from Brown University with a degree in Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences. In 2010, Sand received an Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award in the Department of Public Health to study recruitment approaches for under-resourced, marginalized populations and the role of social networks in healthcare decisions and patient psychology. A four-year student-athlete, she partnered with Pat Griffin and the Gay and Lesbian Sports Education Network to mandate diversity training for National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) athletes and coaches to increase awareness of issues affecting sexual and gender minorities. Following graduation, she taught 9th grade English and bilingual education as a Teach For America corps member in Denver, Colorado. While teaching, Sand participated in the Teaching as Leadership and Education 4 Justice Fellowships where she coached incoming cohorts of TFA corps members to build their pedagogies upon critical race theories and cultivate student-centered, multicultural classrooms. This experience led her to San Francisco to work in educational technology and social justice pedagogy. Sand is a certified Emergency Medical Technician and worked as an Emergency Department Medical Scribe at Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center in New York City prior to completing the postbaccalaureate premedical program at Bryn Mawr College. Sand is excited to be a member of Urban Health Scholars because she is committed to understanding the sociocultural factors that impact health outcomes of urban medically underserved populations and aspires to pursue clinical opportunities in urban health and trauma-informed care. Jacob Perlson - 2021 Jacob is a Chicago native and graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He graduated in 2015 with a degree in Biology and minor in Global Health. During his junior year at UW, Jacob organized a semester of fieldwork in the cone of South America where he found himself in such settings as a volunteer in a Patagonian national park to a community health worker in Buenos Aires. This latter experience, combined with his senior year involvement with an LGBTQ healthcare advocacy organization, piqued his interest in HIV/AIDS services and healthcare in medically underserved communities. Jacob then served as an AmeriCorps member in the HIV program of a Federally Qualified Health Center in Chicago in the year following his graduation. The experience of providing health education, program support, and HIV testing services all helped solidify Jacob's commitment to joining the fight for health equity, especially for people living with or vulnerable to HIV. Through his time at Erie Family Health Center, Jacob came to understand that HIV does not exist in a vacuum, but rather at the intersection of many other co-occurring social and medical issues ranging from substance misuse to unequal access to healthcare. This desire to understand \"epidemics\" in all in their interdisciplinary nuance helped motivate Jacob's decision to focus on urban health while at Geisel. As an Urban Health Scholar, Jacob hopes to better understand the forces that shape health disparities through direct service and learning alongside a group of peers equally committed to positive change in urban underserved areas. Kenneth Williams - 2021 My name is Kenny Williams and I'm from Albany, NY. After graduating High School I attended Union College in Schenectady, NY where I majored in Neuroscience. During my time in college I became increasingly interested in education and education policy so upon graduation I joined Teach for America. I began teaching middle school math and science on the west side of Chicago and quickly fell in love with the students and community. I also pursued a graduate degree in education at Dominican University in IL. After several years, I decided to leave the classroom and pursue my interest in medicine. I completed a Post-Baccalaureate program at Loyola University in Chicago which helped me to re-engage with my science courses and prepare for medical school. I am excited to be a part of the Urban Health Scholars program as I plan to work in communities similar to those I taught in. I am also deeply interested in and passionate about the interplay between health and education. Trenika Williams - 2021 Luke Mayer grew up in rural Hartland Vermont, just 10 miles south of Hanover along the Connecticut River. Luke went to Hartford High School before shipping off to Los Angeles to play baseball at Claremont McKenna College. After graduating, Luke spent a year in a cancer immunology lab at the University of Connecticut before transitioning to research the clinical implications of baseball pitcher biomechanics for the orthopedics department at Massachusetts General Hospital. During this time, Luke also developed and directed an academic biotechnology-focused summer camp for the National Student Leadership Conference. This experience, as well as growing up in a family full of teachers, has helped Luke understand the extent to which mentorship can alter the trajectory of a student's path. With that in mind, Luke hopes to create an academic mentorship program that provides students from undereducated communities with the vision of a path to a STEM career. With his own career plans ultimately taking him to an urban environment, Luke seeks to prepare himself to serve that community through working to better understand the challenges unique to the urban context. Spencer was raised in Queens, New York and then Baton Rouge, Louisiana, going on to graduate from The Ohio State University with a degree in Biology. He has been interested in urban health since his family opened up a medical practice (primary care) in Gonzales, Louisiana, an underserved city. From childhood to the present day, he came across many instances of disparity between where his family lived as opposed to the less socioeconomically advantaged community the clinic served. With the rationale that, through law and policy, he could address these and other societal components of health, and also to explore other interests, he attended and graduated from Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, concentrating on the human rights and health policy side of the law. He spent time volunteering on an HIV/AIDS health education project in Thailand and Vietnam at a Southeast Asian human rights NGO and subsequently worked as an associate at a bioethics public affairs organization. After realizing that practicing medicine was a career that would be the most fulfilling for him, he decided that he would do both -- practice medicine and serve as an advocate. As an Urban Health Scholar, I would like to create a space where I can work with my colleagues toward my goal of combining these two disciplines. Ultimately, I would like to continue exploring some of the ever-present socioeconomic disparities in America's urban society and also investigate the ways that law and policy may raise the quality of health and life of underserved populations. Sima grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from UCLA in 2005 with degrees in neuroscience and physiological science. Her two passions in life are helping improve therapeutic options available to patients and helping underserved populations access better health care. To realize these goals, she has volunteered as a research assistant at UCLA's Brain Mapping Center since 2002. In her studies of neurophysiology and pathology, she employed the non-invasive neurostimulation technique transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). She utilized TMS to study novel treatments for a variety of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and dystonia, with promising results. She also enjoyed volunteering at a local Emergency Room where she provided patient support and advocacy. In addition to her volunteer work, she worked full-time managing a business in downtown Los Angeles selling ladies fashion footwear since 2006. She also founded and managed the business's online presence, which more than doubled yearly revenues. She hopes to bring the values of teamwork and innovation to her medical career. As an Urban Health Scholar, she aspires to learn how to best use available resources to mitigate the socioeconomic and environmental pressures that affect the health of urban populations. Growing up as an immigrant from a humble background, Sima saw first-hand the healthcare difficulties underprivileged people face. Her experience with limited resources allows her to appreciate the unique hardships endured by low-income and minority communities. Sima's ultimate goal as a physician is to use her experiences and insight to help provide better access to care to underserved communities in Los Angeles. Cristina Alcorta, MD - 2019 Cristina grew up in northern New Jersey, right across the Hudson River from New York City. She graduated from Harvard University in 2012 with a degree in Human Evolutionary Biology. As an undergraduate, Cristina was involved in multiple community building and advising programs. She was a member of Latinos in Health Careers, a group that supported student professional interests with multiple resources, and served as a Peer Advising Fellow for Harvard freshmen. She volunteered as a Student Researcher at Harvard Medical School's Crimson Care Collaborative, where she gathered demographic and quality improvement data for a poor, refugee/post-incarcerated population in Chelsea, MA. After graduating college, she worked for Boston Children's Hospital as a Research Coordinator in the Neonatal Pulmonary Department, focusing primarily on respiratory issues in premature infants. Cristina wishes to stay active in urban communities as a pediatrician. She believes the Urban Health Scholars Program will fortify her values of service and give her ample opportunity to stay involved in resource-deficient populations. Brendin grew up in Vernon, Connecticut. He graduated from Dartmouth College, with a degree in Biology (Genetics) and a minor in Applied Ethics. As an undergraduate, he worked in a computational genetics lab and completed a senior thesis investigating the associations between diet, genetics and metabolic syndrome in a cohort of Alaskan Natives. This work underscored the importance of considering lifestyle factors and the role of environment in investigating disease-related outcomes. After graduation, he completed a Health Policy Fellowship at The Dartmouth Institute, where he supported the implementation and analysis of the National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), as well as the evaluation of patient reported outcomes measurement. Brendin is interested in examining how innovate payment systems (e.g., global payment) will impact the care of vulnerable populations in urban communities, and how support for other contributors of health is integrated into the traditional spheres of healthcare. He is also passionate about learning how to achieve better population health through community-based initiatives (e.g., smoking cessation programs, substance abuse support services, HIV education and screening, healthy eating and exercise programs, etc.). Outside of the classroom, Brendin is a volunteer assistant coach for the Dartmouth Track and Field team, and he also enjoys skiing, hiking and exploring the Upper Valley. Aaron hails from the sandy, windswept shores of San Diego, California. While Aaron was privileged enough to grow up in a quiet suburb much of his extended family lives in poverty in Northern Philadelphia. Seeing his family struggle beneath the crippling disparities that permeate underserved urban communities inspired Aaron to use his privileged, educated upbringing to help those who were not as fortunate as himself. Throughout high school and his undergraduate study at Dartmouth Aaron worked extensively with underserved populations - focusing specifically on supporting the homeless, as well as victims of domestic violence and abuse. Aaron graduated from Dartmouth College in 2015 with a degree in Biology and began his first year at Geisel shortly after. While Aaron entered medical school with the intention of practicing within underserved urban areas he was unsure of the capacity in which he may best serve these communities. Aaron joined the Urban Health Scholars to gain an understanding of the unique medical challenges facing underserved communities in order to better prepare himself for a career in which he might work to meet them. Chinwe was born and raised in Chicago, IL. Growing up on the south side of Chicago, Chinwe saw first had many of the challenges and disparities faced by its residents everyday. She also worked as a Pharmacy Technician for CVS Pharmacy in various locations throughout the city, and saw the vast gap between the privileged, the poor, and those in between when it came to health care access, quality, and delivery. These experiences amplified Chinwe's pursuit of not only becoming a physician, but also an advocate for those in need. She graduated from University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign in 2012 where she obtained her bachelors degree in Community Health, specializing in Health Planning and Administration. After graduating, she moved further south in Illinois to Southern Illinois University in Carbondale where she completed the MEDPREP program and obtained her Master in Public Health specializing in Health Education. Here, Chinwe was deeply involved in efforts on campus to decrease unwanted pregnancies and STI contraction among high risk students. She also traveled to Naranjito, Honduras during January 2013 to participate in a medical brigade that brought medical services to a small town that would otherwise completely lack access to health care. Chinwe is very passionate about the promotion of healthy behaviors, both mental and physical, and is confident in the experiences, knowledge, and networking that she will gain from the Urban Health Scholars. Alec was born and raised in Los Angeles and almost became a professional surfer - decided to study physics at Johns Hopkins instead. At Hopkins I became interested in Neuroscience, majored in it and changed life trajectory to go to medical school. Before applying to medical school I wanted to get real life experiences and work with helping others so I went into Teach for America in Los Angeles specifically teaching in Watts at Locke High School. I taught physics for two years and raised engagement in sciences with hands on labs and after school science discovery clubs. Teaching at Locke exposed me to the disparities across socioeconomic boundaries which has led me to want to work with underserved populations. What excited me to go to Dartmouth Medical School so I could be part of the Urban Health Scholars group and get access to underserved populations while in a rural environment. The pipeline dream is to become a neurosurgeon and work to care for underserved populations in my hometown of Los Angeles, providing opportunities to care on a volunteer basis and work with local schools to increase interest in medical sciences and build mentorship programs for underprivileged high school students interested in medical sciences. Sarah was born and raised in Arlington, MA, a Boston suburb. She graduated from Boston University in 2015 with a major in health science and minor in business administration. During her time at BU, she got involved with Health Leads, a non-profit that helps connect patients and families to local non-medical recourses that impact their health and well-being. It was through Health Leads that Sarah volunteered at both Boston Medical Center and Dimock Community Health Center in Roxbury but it was though the community health center that she really saw how a community integrated approach could combat the social determinants of health. Afterwards she interned at the Brigham and Women's Southern Jamaica Plain Health Center where she had two roles: coordinating care on an interdisciplinary team for high-risk patients and helping out with the center's NCQA application to get certified as a patient centered medical home. As an Urban Health Scholar, Sarah hopes to continue to stay involved in and learn more about the needs of urban communities, so that she can ultimately advocate for and implement changes that will better her patients' overall health and wellness. Outside of Geisel, she enjoys skating on Dartmouth's figure skating team, playing soccer, and spending time with family. Courtney was raised in Fullerton, California. She graduated from Amherst College in 2011 with a degree in English. After her undergraduate work, she lived in Salzburg, Austria where she played for the city's professional team within the Elite Women's Hockey League. She then spent two years in Boston, working to coordinate clinical trials for patients with multiple myeloma. Her most rewarding work in Boston was in helping to improve access to care by securing oncology therapies for patients who could not otherwise afford treatment. She received her Masters in Pharmaceutical Development with an emphasis in biologics manufacture and in-vitro diagnostics from the Keck Graduate Institute in Claremont, CA. There she worked as a peer health advocate, providing health and wellness counseling for undergraduate students within Los Angeles County. Through her work she learned the importance of educational programs in forming students' health behaviors; she co-developed risk mitigation programming for students to promote positive mental, physical, and sexual health behaviors. Through the Urban Health Scholars program, Courtney aims to learn new strategies and care models to best serve urban populations--after graduation she hopes to return to Los Angeles to address challenges of care access and health literacy through community-based initiatives. Outside the classroom, Courtney is a volunteer assistant coach for the Hanover High School girls hockey team and enjoys exploring the greater NH/VT area. Tim was born and raised in Portland, OR, Tim studied social science at the University of Washington. Making the most of his time there, yet having no clue on a career path, Tim joined Teach For America, and taught chemistry and AP Chemistry in inner city Detroit. It was there where Tim found his passion for critical consciousness and social justice. What started out as a two-year stint evolved into 5 years, where Tim took on leadership and administrative roles in Detroit's education, fostering the development of more than 5,000 students city-wide. While in the classroom, Tim saw gross inequalities, rooted in two concepts. First, there were a lack of resources that severely impeded access to an education, to healthcare, proper nutrition and many other basic human rights. Second, this inequality was systemic, running along lines of race, class and privilege. This committed Tim to seeking an opportunity to not only provide resources and treatment, but also help the most disadvantaged populations advocate for themselves. That is how Tim found medicine, a profession beyond simply providing treatment, but helping patients and the most disadvantaged populations advocate for their own health. So he took classes, volunteered in emergency rooms and is now reflecting on opportunities to serve inner-city populations after medical school. T.J. Meehan - 2019 T.J. was born and raised in central Connecticut in a suburb of Hartford. He graduated from Colby College in 2012 where he majored in Science, Technology & Society. During each summer of his undergraduate years, T.J. worked as a Research Assistant at Qualidigm, a consulting and research firm focused on quality improvement and cost-effectiveness of health care. It was through this organization that he learned that the care received by minority patients in his home-state is suboptimal and that disparities exist in access, use, and patient experience of care. Following college, T.J. continued working for Qualidigm on two research projects: one that measured the impact of EHRs on quality of care, and another focused on reducing hospital readmission rates. After a year with Qualidigm, T.J. joined the Community HealthCorps, a Connecticut-based AmeriCorps program that allowed him to serve as a Health Navigator and Quality Improvement Project Manager at Community Health Center Inc., a multi-site FQHC. Some of the most rewarding experiences that he had as an AmeriCorps member included: spending time at a veteran's home talking to patients about affordable oral care services; going door-to-door in low-income neighborhoods talking to residents about the Affordable Care Act and what it meant to them; meeting with low English proficiency immigrants to assist them in enrolling in health insurance plans; and providing free HIV/AIDs screening tests at a homeless shelter. At Geisel, T.J. hopes to find his niche at the intersection of urban health and community development. T.J. enjoys playing and coaching basketball and spending time with friends and family. Dwan was born in Bogota, Colombia and immigrated to the United States with his family when he was 8 years old. He graduated from Boston College where he majored in economics. Dwan then worked for a technology consulting firm on merger integration projects for clients in the biotechnology and technology services sectors. Although he enjoyed many aspects of consulting work, it was lacking in one key respect. Dwan longed for work that satisfied his humanitarian impulses. After he resigned from his position, he spent a summer volunteering at the inpatient pediatric unit at the Boston Medical Center. It was during this volunteer experience that he was inspired to pursue a career in medicine and, in particular, to work with immigrant and urban underserved populations. He completed the medical school prerequisites at the Harvard Extension School and concurrently volunteered with The Family Van, a mobile health unit that provides free health screenings and health counseling to members of the inner city communities of Boston. Dwan also worked as a research assistant at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Brigham and Women's Hospital on basic science and clinical research projects. His interests in medicine mirror his pre-medical experiences. He is interested in pediatrics, primary care, and addressing healthcare disparities. As an Urban Health Scholar, Dwan hopes to continue to cultivate his interest for urban health and to share his knowledge and passion for urban health with his fellow scholars as well as the greater Dartmouth community. In his spare time, Dwan enjoys outdoor activities and spending time with friends and family. David Whitehead, MD - 2019 Dave grew up in Downingtown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in Chemical Engineering.

In her spare time, she enjoys traveling, playing music, snowboarding, and trying new foods. Tina Jaramillo - 2017 Tina was born in upstate New York and raised in Bethlehem, PA. From there, she went on to graduate in 2012 from Cornell University with a B.A. in Biological Sciences and Psychology. Her time spent working at the Cayuga Medical Center sparked her interest in medicine as well as caring for the underserved. After graduation, she spent the year working in the Americorps program, City Year Boston, where she tutored and mentored 10th graders at an inner-city public high school. From this experience, she gained perspective on the challenges low-income populations face, both inside and outside of the classroom. These challenges included many health related issues, and she saw her students struggle to gain access to the high quality care they deserved. Her time at the English High School confirmed that she wants to eventually work to close the disparity gap in health care, as well as work with youth populations who are the most at risk. As an Urban Health Scholar, she is excited to gain insight and knowledge on the struggles of at-risk inner-city populations, as well as strategies on how to spend her career advocating for health equity. After Geisel, she isn't sure exactly what branch of medicine she would like to pursue, but is strongly considering looking for a specialty within the pediatric realm. Hayley Jones - 2017 Evelyn Bae - 2016 Evelyn Bae was born and raised in Blue Bell, PA, outside of Philadelphia. She graduated from Cornell University in 2010, having majored in Human Development Studies. She first became interested in public health issues while at Cornell, volunteering with several local health organizations including a syringe exchange program at an AIDS clinic and pregnancy center. These experiences spurred her interest in local health programs targeting community specific needs. After graduating from college, she worked for two years in aging research at the Columbia University Medical Center. Living and working in New York City, while continuing to volunteer with programs serving predominantly immigrant populations, she recognized the importance of cultural and socioeconomic diversity, and access in issues relevant to urban medicine.
