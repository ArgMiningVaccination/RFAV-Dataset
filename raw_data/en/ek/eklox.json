Due to the nature of essential oils and safe dilution guidelines, the aroma is more subtle than synthetic perfumes and do not have the stabilizers for long lasting aroma. As the skin absorbs the oils the aroma will become more faint but the therapeutic properties are still at work within your system. Tip...
