Our industry-leading antibody technologies and scientific teams enable us to identify and study dozens of potential drug candidates simultaneously and with great efficiency. The best of these candidates then progress into thorough preclinical and clinical research phases, building our completely homegrown portfolio of over 30 investigational medicines. A bird's eye view into our approach to preclinical and clinical research Check out our key publications in these areas of study and beyond.

Putting patients first At every stage of research, from early genetic research through bringing potential medicines through clinical development, we work closely with patient advocacy groups and the specific disease communities to listen, understand and apply their experiences to our work. These insights help us learn from those most intimately impacted by certain diseases, ensuring that we help meet their needs. This guidance especially helps to inform our clinical trial designs, clinical trial recruitment processes and therapeutic delivery systems. We celebrate and appreciate our relationships with each unique disease community and are proud to support the efforts of advocacy organizations.

Cardiovascular and metabolic disorders encompass a large number of diseases, including coronary artery disease and diabetes. Our clinical programs focus on treating cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and other developed countries, and on muscle-growth disorders. We approach early-stage research for cardiovascular and metabolic disease interventions in multiple ways: - The complement cascade is a component of the immune system effective at clearing pathogens from the body. When dysregulated, however, complement can damage cells and organs. We are developing complement inhibitorsfor diseases like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. - We are also researching both forms of hypercholesterolemia through different mechanisms, including using fully-human monoclonal antibodies to target proteins that contribute to lipoprotein metabolism. - Using agonist antibodies that target the leptin receptor, we aim to help correct the metabolic consequences of abnormalities in leptin signaling. - More than two decades of our research has helped us understand the biology and natural history of the ultra-rare disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), an ultra-rare and debilitating genetic disease that starting at a young age, progressively replaces muscle, tendons, ligaments and fascia with bone (heterotopic ossification or HO). We are investigating a fully-human monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes Activin A, which we have discovered plays a key role in FOP by driving HO. "}
