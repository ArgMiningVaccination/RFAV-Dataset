Four infants in Tiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu died soon after the vaccine was administered to them at a primary health centre on Wednesday. Health ministry records show that besides Tamil Nadu, the vaccine was also nine-month-old children. According to health minister A Ramadoss, use of 45 lakh doses of the measles vaccine made by HBI has been suspended till an inquiry into its efficacy and safety is completed. A stockpile of the vaccine, supplied to the ministry by Serum Institute, will be used across the country till then. Pawan Murti of the National Polio Surveillance Project, who was sent to Tamil Nadu on Wednesday for initial investigations, told The Times of India from Chennai, \"It could have been because of a human error in case nurses at the PHC by mistake mixed the vaccine with chemical vials of antibiotic, adrenalin or muscle relaxants, as all the vials look the same. It could also have been because the vaccine, after being reconstituted, was kept out in the open causing bacterial growth and contamination. The post-morten reports of the four children will come tomorrow and we will get an idea then.\" The ministry purchases 350 lakh doses of the vaccine annually for its immunisation programme. While 80% of its requirement was to be met by Serum this year, the rest was to come from HBI. Meanwhile, a team of experts comprising the director general of health services Dr R K Srivastava, National Institute of Communicable Diseases director Dr Shiv Lal and officials from the Indian Council of Medical Research and Drug Controller General of India left for Chennai on Thursday evening to investigate the deaths. They have been asked to give their preliminary assessment report within a week. Ramadoss told TOI that if the vaccines, which are being tested at CRI Kasauli, are found to be contaminated and unsafe, the ministry will immediately blacklist HBI. Ramadoss, who held an emergency meeting on Thursday which was attended by officials from the health ministry, DGHS, DCGI, NICD and ICMR, said, \"The vaccines were tested before they were released to states. So we aren't sure if the vaccine caused the deaths because the same batch was administered to other children. However, if found contaminated, we will waste no time in suspending further orders. We allowed HBI to supply us with the vaccine because it was a PSU.\" Ramadoss, who was confident that the national measles programme would not suffer due to the deaths, added, \"I have asked a high-level team to visit the area and enquire about the incident including testing the quality of vaccine, status of the cold chain, quality of dilutants, distribution and administration of the vaccine including any human error that could have led to this adverse event following immunisation.\" The minister said experts of the polio programme had already been deputed to Tamil Nadu to assist the state in investigating the deaths. The polio programme has been undertaking detailed surveillance for measles since last year. Alongside polio, surveillance for measles was underway in Tamil "}
