Add More Soup to Your Diet The temperature can have an impact on both your health and your immune system function. When it's cold outside, a warm, comforting bowl of soup can bring your body temperature up and keep your immune system strong. Soups are often packed with nutritious, immune system-boosting ingredients, like carrots, turmeric, and garlic. Warm, nourishing foods like soup can also help to balance the doshas. Each dosha is connected to specific physical functions, and keeping your doshas balanced can help you to maintain your health. Whether your dominant dosha is vata, kapha, or pitta, you can really benefit from eating more soup.

Start Drinking Warm Water It's important to remove toxins from your body so that it will be capable of fighting off illnesses. [While an Ayurvedic cleanse is one of the best ways to detoxify](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/why-you-should-try-an-ayurvedic-cleansing-program), you can also remove toxins from your body by sipping on warm water throughout the day. The water you drink will be absorbed into your circulatory system, clearing away toxins that are blocking your cellular channels and tissue. When these toxins are washed away, it's likely that you'll feel lighter and more refreshed. You'll also be able to absorb more nutrients from the foods that you eat. 4. Use the Right Spices and Herbs to Boost Immunity Ayurveda's [healing trifecta](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/blog) is: herbs, food as medicine, and Ayurveda lifestyle practices, such as breathwork and meditation. The suitability of any of these tools is highly dependent on the individual. What is correct for one person may be incorrect for another. \"Taking the incorrect herb can create imbalances, so we want to act with knowledge and clarity.

An [Ayurvedic consultation ](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/)provides a clear picture of what herbs, foods as medicine, and Ayurveda lifestyle tools will serve you optimally.\" - Veena, Saumya Ayurveda Spices and herbs play an important role in Ayurvedic medicine. While these herbs can be used medicinally, including them in your meals can also help to keep your immune system strong and your body in good health. Spices that you'll want to use more of include cumin, turmeric, and cardamom. Beneficial herbs include dill, basil, and fennel. Not only can these seasonings improve the flavor of your food, but they can also help to correct dosha imbalances. For example, black pepper or mustard seed can help to correct a kapha imbalance.
