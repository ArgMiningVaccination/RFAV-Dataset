ISBN: 978-0-9722522-2-5CIP data in processPrinted in the United States of America by RR World Cancer Research Fund International ivI am very grateful to the special group of distinguished scientists who made up the Panel and Secretariat for this major review of the evidence on food, nutrition, physical activityand cancer. The vision of WCRF International in convening this Panel and confidence inletting a strong-willed group of scientists have their way is to be highly commended. In our view, the evidence reviewed here that led to our recommendations provides a wonderful opportunity to prevent cancer and improve global health. Individuals andpopulations have in their hands the means to lead fuller, healthier lives. Achieving thatwill take action, globally, nationally, and locally, by communities, families, andindividuals. It is worth pausing to put this Report in context. Public perception is often that experts disagree. Why should the public or policy-makers heed advice if experts differ in theirviews? Experts do disagree. That is the nature of science and a source of its strength.Should we throw up our hands and say one opinion is as good as another? Of course not.Evidence matters. But not evidence unguided by human thought. Hence the process thatwas set up for this review: use a systematic approach to examine all the relevant evidenceusing predetermined criteria, and assemble an international group of experts who, havingbrought their own knowledge to bear and having debated their disagreements, arrive atjudgements as to what this evidence means. Both parts of the exercise were crucial: thesystematic review and, dare I say it, the wisdom of the experts. The elegance of the process was one of the many attractions to me of assuming the role of chair of the Panel. I could pretend that it was the major reason, and in a way it was, butthe first reason was enjoyment. What a pleasure and a privilege to spend three years inthe company of a remarkable group of scientists, including world leaders in research onthe epidemiology of cancer, as well as leaders in nutrition and public health and thebiology of cancer, to use a relatively new methodology (systematic literature reviews),supported by a vigorous and highly effective Secretariat, on an issue of profoundimportance to global public health: the prevention of cancer by means of healthy patternsof eating and physical activity. It was quite as enjoyable as anticipated. Given this heady mix, the reasons why I might have wanted to take on the role of Panel chair were obvious. I did question the wisdom of WCRF International in inviting me to doit. Much of my research has been on cardiovascular disease, not cancer. What I describedas my ignorance, WCRF International kindly labelled impartiality. WCRF also appreciated the parallels between dietary causes of cardiovascular disease and cancer. There is a great deal of concordance. In general, recommendations in thisReport to prevent cancer will also be of great relevance to cardiovascular disease. The onlysignificant contradiction is with alcohol. From the point of view of cancer prevention, thebest level of alcohol consumption is zero. This is not the case for cardiovascular disease,where the evidence suggests that one to two drinks a day are protective. The Paneltherefore framed its recommendation to take this into account. The fact that the conclusions and recommendations in this Report are the unanimous view of the Panel does not imply that, miraculously, experts have stopped disagreeing. ThePanel debated the fine detail of every aspect of its conclusions and recommendations withremarkable vigour and astonishing stamina. In my view, this was deliberation at its best. Ifconclusions could simply fall out of systematic literature reviews, we would not haveneeded experts to deliberate. Human judgement was vital; and if human, it cannot beinfallible. But I venture to suggest this process has led to as good an example of evidence-based public health recommendations as one can find. Throughout the Panel's deliberations, it had in mind the global reach of this Report. Most of the research on diet and cancer comes from high-income countries. But PPrreeffaacceevnoncommunicable diseases, including cancer, are now major public health burdens in every region of the world. An important part of our deliberations was to ensure theglobal applicability of our recommendations. One last point about disagreement among experts: its relevance to the link between science and policy. A caricature would be to describe science as precise and policy-makersas indecisive. In a way, the opposite is the case. Science can say: could be, might be,some of us think this, and some think that. Policy-makers have either to do it or not do it \u2014 more often, not. Our effort here was to increase the precision of scientificjudgements. As the Report makes clear, many of our conclusions are in the 'could be'category. None of our recommendations is based on these 'could be' conclusions. All arebased on judgements that evidence was definite or probable. Our recommendations, wetrust, will serve as guides to the population, to scientists, and to opinion-formers. But what should policy-makers do with our judgements? A year after publication of this Report, we will publish a second report on policy for diet, nutrition, physical activity,and the prevention of cancer. As an exercise developing out of this one, we decided toapply, as far as possible, the same principles of synthesis of evidence to policy-making.We enhanced the scientific panel that was responsible for this Report with experts innutrition and food policy. This policy panel will oversee systematic literature reviews onfood policy, deliberate, and make recommendations. The current Report and next year's Policy Report have one overriding aim: to reduce the global burden of cancer by means of healthier living.

CANCER: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE Introduction This summary provides an abbreviated version of the full Report. It highlights the wealth of information and datastudied by the Panel and is designed to give readers anoverview of the key issues contained within the Report,notably the process, the synthesis of the scientific evidence,and the resulting judgements and recommendations. TThhee ffiirrsstt aanndd sseeccoonndd RReeppoorrttss Food, Nutrition and the Prevention of Cancer: a global per- spective, produced by the World Cancer Research Fund together with the American Institute for Cancer Research,has been the most authoritative source on food, nutrition,and cancer prevention for 10 years. On publication in 1997,it immediately became recognised as the most authoritativeand influential report in its field and helped to highlight theimportance of research in this crucial area. It became thestandard text worldwide for policy-makers in governmentat all levels, for civil society and health professional organ-isations, and in teaching and research centres of academicexcellence. Since the mid-1990s the amount of scientific literature on this subject has dramatically increased. New methods ofanalysing and assessing evidence have been developed,facilitated by advances in electronic technology. There ismore evidence, in particular on overweight and obesity andon physical activity; food, nutrition, physical activity, andcancer survivors is a new field. The need for a new reportwas obvious; and in 2001 WCRF International in collabora-tion with AICR began to put in place a global process inorder to produce and publish the Report in November 2007. HHooww tthhiiss RReeppoorrtt hhaass bbeeeenn aacchhiieevveedd The goal of this Report is to review all the relevant research, using the most meticulous methods, in order to generate acomprehensive series of recommendations on food, nutri-tion, and physical activity, designed to reduce the risk ofcancer and suitable for all societies. This process is also thebasis for a continuous review of the evidence. Organised into overlapping stages, the process has been designed to maximise objectivity and transparency, separat-ing the collection of evidence from its assessment andjudgement. First, an expert task force developed a methodfor systematic review of the voluminous scientific literature.Second, research teams collected and reviewed the litera-ture based upon this methodology. Third, an expert Panelhas assessed and judged this evidence and agreed recom-mendations. The results are published in this Report andsummarised here. A more detailed explanation of this process is given in Chapter 3 and the research teams andinvestigators involved are listed on pages viii-xi. This Report is a guide to future scientific research, cancer prevention education programmes, and health policyaround the world. It provides a solid evidence base forpolicy-makers, health professionals, and informed andinterested people to draw on and work with. Overview of the second expert Report This Report has a number of inter-related general purposes.One is to explore the extent to which food, nutrition, phys-ical activity, and body composition modify the risk of can-cer, and to specify which factors are most important. To theextent that environmental factors such as food, nutrition,and physical activity influence the risk of cancer, it is a pre-ventable disease. The Report specifies recommendationsbased on solid evidence which, when followed, will beexpected to reduce the incidence of cancer. PPaarrtt 11 \u2014\u2014 BBaacckkggrroouunndd Chapter 1 shows that patterns of production and con- sumption of food and drink, of physical activity, and of bodycomposition have changed greatly throughout humanhistory. Remarkable changes have taken place as a result of urbanisation and industrialisation, at first in Europe,North America, and other economically advanced coun-tries, and increasingly in most countries in the world.Notable variations have been identified in patterns of can-cer throughout the world. Significantly, studies consistentlyshow that patterns of cancer change as populations migratefrom one part of the world to another and as countriesbecome increasingly urbanised and industrialised. Pro-jections indicate that rates of cancer in general are liable to increase. Chapter 2 outlines current understanding of the biology of the cancer process, with special attention to the ways inwhich food and nutrition, physical activity, and body com-position may modify the risk of cancer. Cancer is a diseaseof genes, which are vulnerable to mutation, especially overthe long human lifespan. However, evidence shows thatonly a small proportion of cancers are inherited.Environmental factors are most important and can be mod-ified. These include smoking and other use of tobacco;infectious agents; radiation; industrial chemicals and pollu-tion; medication; and also many aspects of food, nutrition,physical activity, and body composition. SummaryxvSUMMARY Chapter 3 summarises the types of evidence that the Panel has agreed are relevant to its work. No single study or study type can prove that any factor definitely is a causeof, or is protective against, any disease. In this chapter,building on the work of the first report, the Panel showsthat reliable judgements on causation of disease are basedon assessment of a variety of well-designed epidemiologi-cal and experimental studies. The prevention of cancer worldwide is one of the most pressing challenges facing scientists and public healthpolicy-makers, among others. These introductory chaptersshow that the challenge can be effectively addressed andsuggest that food, nutrition, physical activity, and bodycomposition play a central part in the prevention of cancer. PPaarrtt 22 \u2014\u2014 EEvviiddeennccee aanndd JJuuddggeemmeennttss The judgements made by the Panel in Part 2 are based on independently conducted systematic reviews of the litera-ture commissioned from academic institutions in the USA,UK, and continental Europe. The evidence has been metic-ulously assembled and, crucially, the display of the evi-dence was separated from assessments derived from thatevidence. Seven chapters present the findings of thesereviews. The Panel's judgements are displayed in the formof matrices that introduce five of these chapters, and in thesummary matrix on the fold-out page inside the back cover. Chapter 4, the first and longest chapter in Part 2, is con- cerned with types of food and drink. The judgements of thePanel are, whenever possible, food- and drink-based,reflecting the most impressive evidence. Findings ondietary constituents and micronutrients (for example foodscontaining dietary fibre) are identified where appropriate.Evidence on dietary supplements, and on patterns of diet,is included in the two final sections of this chapter. Chapters 5 and 6 are concerned with physical activity and with body composition, growth, and development.Evidence in these areas is more impressive than was thecase up to the mid-1990s; the evidence on growth anddevelopment indicates the importance of an approach tothe prevention of cancer that includes the whole lifecourse. Chapter 7 summarises and judges the evidence as applied to 17 cancer sites, with additional briefer sum-maries based on narrative reviews of five further body sys-tems and cancer sites. The judgements shown in thematrices in this chapter correspond with the judgementsshown in the matrices in the previous chapters. Obesity is or may be a cause of a number of cancers. Chapter 8 identifies what aspects of food, nutrition, andphysical activity themselves affect the risk of obesity and associated factors. The judgements, which concern the bio-logical and associated determinants of weight gain, over-weight, and obesity, are based on a further systematicliterature review, amplified by knowledge of physiologicalprocesses. The relevance of food, nutrition, physical activity, and body composition to people living with cancer, and to theprevention of recurrent cancer, is summarised in Chapter 9.Improved cancer screening, diagnosis, and medical servicesare, in many countries, improving survival rates. So thenumber of cancer survivors \u2014 people living after diagnosisof cancer \u2014 is increasing. The Panel agreed that its recommendations should also take into account findings on the prevention of other chron-ic diseases, and of nutritional deficiencies and nutrition-related infectious diseases, especially of childhood. Chapter10, also based on a systematic literature review, is a sum-mary of the findings of expert reports in these areas. The research issues identified in Chapter 11 are, in the view of the Panel, the most promising avenues to explore inorder to refine understanding of the links between food,nutrition, physical activity, and cancer, and so improve theprevention of cancer, worldwide. PPaarrtt 33 \u2014\u2014 RReeccoommmmeennddaattiioonnss Chapter 12, the culmination of the five-year process, pre- sents the Panel's public health goals and personal recom-mendations. These are preceded by a statement of theprinciples that have guided the Panel in its thinking. The goals and recommendations are based on 'convinc- ing' or 'probable' judgements made by the Panel in the chap-ters in Part 2. These are proposed as the basis for publicpolicies and for personal choices that, if effectively imple-mented, will be expected to reduce the incidence of cancerfor people, families, and communities. Eight general and two special goals and recommenda- tions are detailed. In each case a general recommendationis followed by public health goals and/or personal recom-mendations, together with further explanation or clarifica-tion as required. Chapter 12 also includes a summary of theevidence, justification of the goals and recommendations,and guidance on how to achieve them. The process of moving from evidence to judgements and to recommendations has been one of the Panel's mainresponsibilities, and has involved discussion and debateuntil final agreement has been reached. The goals and rec-ommendations here have been unanimously agreed. The goals and recommendations are followed by thexviFOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND THE PREVENTION OF CANCER: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE Panel's conclusions on the dietary patterns most likely to protect against cancer. In order to discern the 'big picture' ofhealthy and protective diets, it is necessary to integrate avast amount of detailed information. The Panel used abroad, integrative approach that, while largely derived fromconventional 'reductionist' research, has sought to find pat-terns of food and drink consumption, of physical activity,and of body fatness, that enable recommendations designedto prevent cancer at personal and population levels. The goals and recommendations are designed to be gen- erally relevant worldwide and the Panel recognises that in national settings, the recommendations of this Report willbe best used in combination with recommendations, issuedby governments or on behalf of nations, designed to preventchronic and other diseases. In addition, the Panel citedthree specific cases where the evidence is strong enough tobe the basis for goals and recommendations, but which cur-rently are relevant only in discrete geographical regions:mat\u00e9 in Latin America, Cantonese-style salted fish in thePearl River Delta in Southern China, and arsenic contami-nating water supplies in several locations. Further details onnutritional patterns and regional and special circumstancescan be found in section 12.3. The main focus of this Report is on nutritional and other biological and associated factors that modify the risk of can-cer. The Panel is aware that as with other diseases, the risk of cancer is also modified by social, cultural, economic, andecological factors. Thus the foods and drinks that peopleconsume are not purely because of personal choice; likewiseopportunities for physical activity can be constrained.Identifying the deeper factors that affect cancer risk enablesa wider range of policy recommendations and options to beidentified. This is the subject of a separate report to be pub-lished in late 2008. The public health goals and personal recommendations of the Panel that follow are offered as a significant contribu-tion towards the prevention and control of cancer through-out the world. The Panel's recommendations The Panel's goals and recommendations that follow areguided by several principles, the details of which can befound in Chapter 12. The public health goals are forpopulations, and therefore for health professionals; therecommendations are for people, as communities, families,and individuals. The Panel also emphasises the importance of not smoking and avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke. Format The goals and recommendations begin with a general state-ment. This is followed by the population goal and the per-sonal recommendation, together with any necessaryfootnotes. These footnotes are an integral part of therecommendations. The full recommendations, includingfurther clarification and qualification, can be found inChapter 12.xviiSUMMARY JJuussttiiffiiccaattiioonn Most populations, and people living in industrialised and urban settings, have habitual levels of activity below levelsto which humans are adapted. With industrialisation, urbanisation, and mechanisation, populations and people become more sedentary. As withoverweight and obesity, sedentary ways of life have beenusual in high-income countries since the second half of the20th century. They are now common if not usual in mostcountries. All forms of physical activity protect against some can- cers, as well as against weight gain, overweight, and obesi-ty; correspondingly, sedentary ways of life are a cause ofthese cancers and of weight gain, overweight, and obesity.Weight gain, overweight, and obesity are also causes ofsome cancers independently of the level of physical activity.Further details of evidence and judgements can be found inChapters 5, 6, and 8. The evidence summarised in Chapter 10 also shows that physical activity protects against other diseases and thatsedentary ways of life are causes of Median adult body mass index (BMI) to be between 21 and 23, depending on the normal range for different populations2 The proportion of the population that is overweight or obese to be no more than the current level, or preferably lower, in 10 years PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Ensure that body weight through childhood and adolescent growth projects3towards the lower end of the normal BMI range at age 21 Maintain body weight within the normal range from age 21 Avoid weight gain and increases in waist circumference throughout adulthood 1'Normal range' refers to appropriate ranges issued by national governments or the World Health Organization 2To minimise the proportion of the population outside the normal range 3'Projects' in this context means following a pattern of growth (weight and height) throughout childhood that leads to adult BMI at the lower end of thenormal range. Such patterns of growth are specified in International ObesityTask Force and WHO growth The proportion of the population that is sedentary1 to be halved every 10 years Average physical activity levels (PALs)1to be above 1.6 PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Be moderately physically active, equivalent to brisk walking,2for at least 30 minutes every day As fitness improves, aim for 60 minutes or more of moderate, or for 30 minutes or more of vigorous, physical activity every day2 3 Limit sedentary habits such as watching television 1The term 'sedentary' refers to a PAL of 1.4 or less. PAL is a way of representing the average intensity of daily physical activity. PAL is calculated as total energyexpenditure as a multiple of basal metabolic rate 2Can be incorporated in occupational, transport, household, or leisure activities 3This is because physical activity of longer duration or greater intensity is more beneficial JJuussttiiffiiccaattiioonn Maintenance of a healthy weight throughout life may be one of the most important ways to protect against cancer.This will also protect against a number of other commonchronic diseases. Weight gain, overweight, and obesity are now generally much more common than in the 1980s and 1990s. Rates ofoverweight and obesity doubled in many high-income coun-tries between 1990 and 2005. In most countries in Asia andLatin America, and some in Africa, chronic diseases includ-ing obesity are now more prevalent than nutritional defi-ciencies and infectious diseases. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of some can- cers. Overweight and obesity also increase the risk of condi-tions including dyslipidaemia, hypertension and stroke, type2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease. Overweight in child-hood and early life is liable to be followed by overweightand obesity in adulthood. Further details of evidence andjudgements can be found in Chapters 6 and 8. Maintenanceof a healthy weight throughout life may be one of the mostimportant ways to protect against cancer.xviiiFOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND THE PREVENTION OF CANCER: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE JJuussttiiffiiccaattiioonn Consumption of energy-dense foods and sugary drinks is increasing worldwide and is probably contributing to theglobal increase in obesity. This overall recommendation is mainly designed to prevent and to control weight gain, overweight, and obesity. Further details of evidence and judgements can be found inChapter 8. 'Energy density' measures the amount of energy (in kcal or kJ) per weight (usually 100 g) of food. Food supplies thatare mainly made up of processed foods, which often containsubstantial amounts of fat or sugar, tend to be more energy-dense than food supplies that include substantial amountsof fresh foods. Taken together, the evidence shows that it isnot specific dietary constituents that are problematic, somuch as the contribution these make to the energy densityof diets. Because of their water content, drinks are less energy- dense than foods. However, sugary drinks provide energybut do not seem to induce satiety or compensatory reduc-tion in subsequent energy intake, and so promote overcon-sumption of energy and thus weight gain.JJuussttiiffiiccaattiioonn An integrated approach to the evidence shows that most diets that are protective against cancer are mainly made upfrom foods of plant origin. Higher consumption of several plant foods probably protects against cancers of various sites. What is meant by 'plant-based' is diets that give more emphasis to those plant foodsthat are high in nutrients, high in dietary fibre (and so in non-starch polysaccharides), and low in energy density. Non-starchy vegetables, and fruits, probably protect against somecancers. Being typically low in energy density, they probablyalso protect against weight gain. Further details of evidenceand judgements can be found in Chapters 4 and 8. Non-starchy vegetables include green, leafy vegetables, broccoli, okra, aubergine (eggplant), and bok choy, but not,for instance, potato, yam, sweet potato, or cassava. Non-starchy roots and tubers include carrots, Jerusalem energy density of diets3to be lowered towards 125 kcal per 100 g Population average consumption of sugary drinks2 to be halved every 10 years PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Consume energy-dense foods1 4 sparingly Avoid sugary drinks2 Consume 'fast foods'5sparingly, if at all 1Energy-dense foods are here defined as those with an energy content of more than about 225-275 kcal per 100 g 2This principally refers to drinks with added sugars. Fruit juices should also be limited 3This does not include drinks 4Limit processed energy-dense foods (also see recommendation 4). Relatively unprocessed energy-dense foods, such as nuts and seeds, have not been shownto contribute to weight gain when consumed as part of typical diets, and theseand many vegetable oils are valuable sources of nutrients 5The term 'fast foods' refers to readily available convenience foods that tend to be energy-dense and consumed frequently and in Population average consumption of non-starchy1 vegetables and of fruits to be at least 600 g (21 oz) daily2 Relatively unprocessed cereals (grains) and/or pulses (legumes), and other foods that are a natural source of dietary fibre, to contribute to a population average of at least 25 g non-starch polysaccharide daily PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Eat at least five portions/servings (at least 400 g or 14 oz) of a variety2of non-starchy vegetables and of fruits every day Eat relatively unprocessed cereals (grains) and/or pulses (legumes) with every meal3 Limit refined starchy foods People who consume starchy roots or tubers4 as staples also to ensure intake of sufficient non-starchy vegetables, fruits, and pulses (legumes) 1This is best made up from a range of various amounts of non-starchy vegetables and fruits of different colours including red, green, yellow, white, purple, andorange, including tomato-based products and allium vegetables such as garlic 2Relatively unprocessed cereals (grains) and/or pulses (legumes) to contribute to an average of at least 25 g non-starch polysaccharide daily 3These foods are low in energy density and so promote healthy weight 4For example, populations in Africa, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region Continued on next pagexixSUMMARY JJuussttiiffiiccaattiioonn An integrated approach to the evidence also shows that many foods of animal origin are nourishing and healthy ifconsumed in modest amounts. People who eat various forms of vegetarian diets are at low risk of some diseases including some cancers, although it isnot easy to separate out these benefits of the diets fromother aspects of their ways of life, such as not smoking,drinking little if any alcohol, and so forth. In addition, meatcan be a valuable source of nutrients, in particular protein,iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. The Panel emphasises that this overall recommendation is not for diets containing no meat\u2014 or diets containing no foods of animal origin. Theamounts are for weight of meat as eaten. As a rough con-version, 300 g of cooked red meat is equivalent to about400-450 g raw weight, and 500 g cooked red meat to about700-750 g raw weight. The exact conversion will dependon the cut of meat, the proportions of lean and fat, and themethod and degree of cooking, so more specific guidance isnot possible. Red or processed meats are convincing orprobable causes of some cancers. Diets with high levels ofanimal fats are often relatively high in energy, increasingthe risk of weight gain. Further details of evidence andjudgements can be found in Chapters 4 and 8.JJuussttiiffiiccaattiioonn The evidence on cancer justifies a recommendation not to drink alcoholic drinks. Other evidence shows that modestamounts of alcoholic drinks are likely to reduce the risk ofcoronary heart disease. The evidence does not show a clear level of consumption of alcoholic drinks below which there is no increase in risk ofthe cancers it causes. This means that, based solely on theevidence on cancer, even small amounts of alcoholic drinksshould be avoided. Further details of evidence and judge-ments can be found in Chapter 4. In framing the recom-mendation here, the Panel has also taken into account theevidence that modest amounts of alcoholic drinks are likelyto protect against coronary heart disease, as described inChapter 10. The evidence shows that all alcoholic drinks have the same effect. Data do not suggest any significant differencedepending on the type of drink. This recommendationtherefore covers all alcoholic drinks, whether beers, wines,spirits (liquors), or other alcoholic drinks. The importantfactor is the amount of ethanol consumed. The Panel emphasises that children and pregnant women should not consume GOAL Population average consumption of red meat to be no more than 300 g (11 oz) a week, very little if any of which to be processed PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION People who eat red meat1 to consume less than 500 g (18 oz) a week, very little if any to be processed2 1'Red meat' refers to beef, pork, lamb, and goat from domesticated animals including that contained in processed foods 2'Processed meat' refers to meat preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or addition of chemical preservatives, including that contained in processed foodsRECOMMENDATION 6 AALLCCOOHHOOLLIICC DDRRIINNKKSS LLiimmiitt aallccoohhoolliicc ddrriinnkkss11 PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL Proportion of the population drinking more than the recommended limits to be reduced by one third every 10 years1 2 PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION If alcoholic drinks are consumed, limit consumption to no more than two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women1 2 3 1This recommendation takes into account that there is a likely protective effect for coronary heart disease 2Children and pregnant women not to consume alcoholic drinks 3One 'drink' contains about 10-15 grams of ethanol Recommendation 4, continued from page xviii The goals and recommendations here are broadly similar to those that have been issued by other international andnational authoritative organisations (see Chapter 10). Theyderive from the evidence on cancer and are supported byevidence on other diseases. They emphasise the importanceof relatively unprocessed (grains), non-starchy veg- fruits, and pulses (legumes), all of which containsubstantial amounts of dietary fibre and a variety ofmicronutrients, and are low or relatively low in energy den-sity. These, and not foods of animal origin, are the recom-mended centre for everyday meals.xxFOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND THE PREVENTION OF CANCER: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE JJuussttiiffiiccaattiioonn The strongest evidence on methods of food preservation, pro- cessing, and preparation shows that salt and salt-preservedfoods are probably a cause of stomach cancer, and that foodscontaminated with aflatoxins are a cause of liver cancer. Salt is necessary for human health and life itself, but at lev- els very much lower than those typically consumed in mostparts of the world. At the levels found not only in high-income countries but also in those where traditional dietsare high in salt, consumption of salty foods, salted foods,and salt itself is too high. The critical factor is the overallamount of salt. Microbial contamination of foods and drinksand of water supplies remains a major public health prob-lem worldwide. Specifically, the contamination of cereals(grains) and pulses (legumes) with aflatoxins, produced bysome moulds when such foods are stored for too long inwarm temperatures, is an important public health problem,and not only in tropical countries. Salt and salt-preserved foods are a probable cause of some cancers. Aflatoxins are a convincing cause of liver can-cer. Further details of evidence and judgements can befound in Chapter 4.JJuussttiiffiiccaattiioonn The evidence shows that high-dose nutrient supplements can be protective or can cause cancer. The studies thatdemonstrate such effects do not relate to widespread useamong the general population, in whom the balance ofrisks and benefits cannot confidently be predicted. A gen-eral recommendation to consume supplements for cancerprevention might have unexpected adverse effects.Increasing the consumption of the relevant nutrientsthrough the usual diet is preferred. The recommendations of this Report, in common with its general approach, are food based. Vitamins, minerals, andother nutrients are assessed in the context of the foods anddrinks that contain them. The Panel judges that the best source of nourishment is foods and drinks, not dietary sup-plements. There is evidence that high-dose dietary supple-ments can modify the risk of some cancers. Although somestudies in specific, usually high-risk, groups have shown evi-dence of cancer prevention from some supplements, thisfinding may not apply to the general population. Their levelof benefit may be different, and there may be unexpectedand uncommon adverse effects. Therefore it is unwise torecommend widespread supplement use as a means of can-cer prevention. Further details of evidence and judgementscan be found in Chapter 4. In general, for otherwise healthy people, inadequacy of intake of nutrients is best resolved by nutrient-dense dietsand not by supplements, as these do not increase consump-tion of other potentially beneficial food constituents. The Panel recognises that there are situations when supplements are advisable. See GOALS Population average consumption of salt from all sources to be less than 5 g (2 g of sodium) a day Proportion of the population consuming more than 6 g of salt (2.4 g of sodium) a day to be halved every 10 years Minimise exposure to aflatoxins from mouldy cereals (grains) or pulses (legumes) PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Avoid salt-preserved, salted, or salty foods; preserve foods without using salt1 Limit consumption of processed foods with added salt to ensure an intake of less than 6 g (2.4 g sodium) a day Do not eat mouldy cereals (grains) or pulses (legumes) 1Methods of preservation that do not or need not use salt include refrigeration, freezing, drying, bottling, canning, and fermentation RECOMMENDATION Maximise the proportion of the population achieving nutritional adequacy without dietary supplements PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION Dietary supplements are not recommended for cancer prevention 1This may not always be feasible. In some situations of illness or dietary inadequacy, supplements may be valuablexxiSUMMARY JJuussttiiffiiccaattiioonn The evidence on cancer as well as other diseases shows that sustained, exclusive breastfeeding is protective for themother as well as the child. This is the first major report concerned with the prevention of cancer to make a recommendation specifically on breast-feeding, to prevent breast cancer in mothers and to preventoverweight and obesity in children. Further details of evi-dence and judgements can be found in Chapters 6 and 8. Other benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and their children are well known. Breastfeeding protects againstinfections in infancy, protects the development of theimmature immune system, protects against other childhooddiseases, and is vital for the development of the bondbetween mother and child. It has many other benefits.Breastfeeding is especially vital in parts of the world wherewater supplies are not safe and where impoverished fami-lies do not readily have the money to buy infant formulaand other infant and young child foods. This recommenda-tion has a special significance. While derived from the evi-dence on being breastfed, it also indicates that policies andactions designed to prevent cancer need to be directedthroughout the whole life course, from the beginning oflife.JJuussttiiffiiccaattiioonn Subject to the qualifications made here, the Panel has agreed that its recommendations apply also to cancer sur- vivors. There may be specific situations where this advicemay not apply, for instance, where treatment has compro-mised gastrointestinal function. If possible, when appropriate, and unless advised otherwise by a qualified professional, the recommendations of thisReport also apply to cancer survivors. The Panel has madethis judgement based on its examination of the evidence,including that specifically on cancer survivors, and also onits collective knowledge of the pathology of cancer and itsinteractions with food, nutrition, physical activity, and bodycomposition. In no case is the evidence specifically on can-cer survivors clear enough to make any firm judgements orrecommendations to cancer survivors. Further details ofevidence and judgements can be found in Chapter 9. Treatment for many cancers is increasingly successful, and so cancer survivors increasingly are living long enoughto develop new primary cancers or other chronic diseases.The recommendations in this Report would also be expect-ed to reduce the risk of those conditions, and so can also berecommended on that account.

Throughout recorded history, wise choices offood and drink, and of habitual behaviour, have beenrecommended to protect against cancer, as well as otherdiseases, and to improve well-being. Reports such as this, which incorporate systematic examination of all relevant types of research, differ fromancient, historical, and even relatively recent accounts, anddescriptive studies of the type detailed in Chapter 1, notonly in the quantity and quality of evidence, but also in thereliability of the judgements and recommendations thatderive from it. TThhee ppuurrppoossee ooff tthhiiss RReeppoorrtt This Report has been commissioned and resourced by the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) International and itssister organisation the American Institute for CancerResearch (AICR), who provided the Secretariat that hassupported the Panel responsible for the Report. Panelmembers, observers, review centres, and other contributorsare listed on the preceding pages. The five-year project thathas resulted in this Report follows a previous five-yearproject that resulted in the first WCRF/AICR reportpublished in 1997, which was the responsibility of theformer distinguished international multidisciplinary panelchaired by Professor John Potter. This Report has two overall general purposes. The first is to summarise, assess, and judge the most comprehensivebody of evidence yet collected and displayed on the subjectof food, nutrition, physical activity, body composition, andthe risk of cancer, throughout the life-course. The secondpurpose is to transform the evidence-derived judgementsinto goals and personal recommendations that are areliable basis for sound policies and effective actions atpopulation, community, family, and individual level, inorder to prevent cancer, worldwide. WWhhaatt iiss aallrreeaaddyy kknnoowwnn The Panel is aware of the general consensus shared by scientists, health professionals, and policy-makers on therelationships between food, nutrition, physical activity,body composition, and the risk of cancer. This consensus, based on the findings of a rapidly growing mass of increasingly well-designedepidemiological and experimental studies and otherrelevant evidence, emerged in the early 1980s. Thus: 'It isabundantly clear that the incidence of all the common cancers in humans is determined by various potentiallycontrollable external factors. This is surely the mostcomforting fact to come out of cancer research, for itmeans that cancer is, in large part, a preventable disease'. 1 This is the conclusion of a report on diet and theprevention of cancer published a quarter of a centurybefore this Report. Since the early 1980s, relevant United Nations agencies, national governments, authoritative non-governmentalorganisations, and researchers and other experts in thefield have agreed that food and nutrition, physical activity,and body composition are individually and collectivelyimportant modifiers of the risk of cancer, and takentogether may be at least as important as tobacco. By the mid-1990s the general consensus became more solidly based on methodical assessment of the totality ofthe relevant literature. Thus: 'It is now established thatcancer is principally caused by environmental factors, ofwhich the most important are tobacco; diet and factorsrelated to diet, including body mass and physical activity;and exposures in the workplace and elsewhere.' Thisstatement introduces the recommendations made in thefirst WCRF/AICR report. Expert reports may be accompanied by guidebooks written for general readers. Thus: 'A healthy eatingstrategy... is an important part of protecting yourselfagainst a long list of diseases. These include heart disease,stroke, several common cancers, cataract formation, otherage-related diseases, and even some types of birth defects.When combined with not smoking and regular exercise, thiskind of healthy diet can reduce heart disease by 80 percent, and stroke and some cancers by 70 percent, comparedwith average rates'. 2This is a conclusion of a book written by a member of the Panel responsible for this Report. Some general judgements are now well known and not a matter for serious debate. Cancer in general, and cancersof different types and sites, are agreed to have variouscauses, among which are inherited genetic predispositionand the increasing likelihood that cells will accumulategenetic defects as people age. This is discussed in moredetail in Chapter 2. Also, people die less frequently fromnutritional deficiencies, infectious diseases, predation, andaccidents, whereas chronic diseases including cancer \u2014which are more common in older people \u2014 become morecommon. However, cancer is not an inevitable consequence of ageing, and people's susceptibility to it varies. There isabundant evidence that the main causes of patterns ofIInnttrroodduuccttiioonnxxiiiINTRODUCTION cancer around the world are environmental. This does indeed mean that at least in principle, most cancer ispreventable, though there is still discussion about therelative importance of various environmental factors. But what are these environmental factors, what is their relative importance, and how may they vary in differenttimes in the life-course and in different parts of the world,and how might they interact with each other? Manythousand epidemiological and experimental studies havelooked for answers. Some answers are now agreed to beunequivocal. Thus, smoking is the chief cause of lungcancer. Alcohol is also an established carcinogen inhumans, as are types of radiation such as those used inmedical treatments and as released by nuclear weaponsand accidents. Certain infectious agents are undoubtedly acause of some cancers. TThhee nneeeedd ffoorr aa nneeww iinniittiiaattiivvee Many questions, particularly in the field of food, nutrition, and associated factors, remain. Some are fundamental. Dostatements such as those quoted above remain valid? Dothey apply worldwide? Have the reviews and reports so farpublished overlooked key findings? How do the largeprospective studies, meta-analyses, pooling projects, andrandomised controlled trials undertaken and publishedsince the mid-1990s impact on earlier conclusions andrecommendations? Are there areas in this field that havebeen neglected? Is entirely new evidence coming to light? Questions such as these led to the commissioning of this Report by WCRF/AICR in 2001. The Panel responsible forthe Report first convened in 2003, and has met twice ayear until 2007. The terms of reference accepted by thePanel at its first meeting were to: Judge the reviews of the scientific and other literature prepared for the Panel by the assigned review teams Devise a series of dietary, associated, and other recommendations suitable for all societies, designed toreduce the risk of cancer Evaluate the consistency between such recommendations and those designed to prevent otherfood-related diseases. The Panel believes that these terms of reference have been fulfilled. The public policy implications of therecommendations made in this Report are the subject of afurther report, to be published in late 2008. SSppeecciiaall ffeeaattuurreess ooff tthhiiss RReeppoorrtt This Report in part adapts and builds on the work of the previous WCRF/AICR report. It also has central featuresthat are new. It is not simply an 'update' of the previousreport. Since the mid-1990s a substantial body of relevantliterature has been published in peer-reviewed journals.Further, the executive officers of WCRF/AICR, itsSecretariat, and the Panel responsible, decided at theoutset that developments in scientific method since themid-1990s, notably in systematic approaches tosynthesising evidence, and as enabled by the electronicrevolution, have been so remarkable that a whole newprocess was justified. Systematic literature reviews This process (described in Appendix A) has involvedsystematic literature reviews (SLRs), which have been usedas the main basis for the Panel's judgements in this Report.These are described in more detail in Chapter 3. They wereundertaken by independent centres of research and reviewexcellence in North America and Europe, to a commonagreed protocol, itself the product of an expertMethodology Task Force. As a result, the judgements of thePanel now are as firmly based as the evidence and the stateof the science allow. Some are new. Some are differentfrom those previously published. Findings that may at firstreading seem to repeat those of the first report are in factthe result of an entirely new process. Rigorous criteria to assess evidence The criteria used in this Report to assess the evidencepresented in the SLRs and from other sources are moreprecise and explicit than, and in some respects differentfrom and more stringent than, those used in the previousreport. During its initial meetings, the Panel reviewed andagreed these criteria before embarking on the formalevidence review. More details are given in Chapter 3. Nevertheless, readers and users of this Report should be able to see how and why the development of scientificmethod and research since the mid-1990s has resulted inconclusions and recommendations here that sometimesvary from, sometimes are much the same as, andsometimes reinforce those of the previous Report. Graphic display of Panel judgements The Panel has retained the matrix technique of displayingits judgements, which introduce the chapters and chaptersections throughout Part 2 of this Report. This technique,pioneered in the first report, has been adapted by thexxivFOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND THE PREVENTION OF CANCER: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE World Health Organization in its 2003 report on diet, nutrition, and the prevention of chronic diseases. Somemembers of the expert consultation responsible for theWHO report, including its chair and vice-chair, have servedas members of the Panel responsible for this Report. In further adapting the format of the matrices used in the first report, the Panel was careful to distinguishbetween evidence strong enough to justify judgements ofconvincing or probable causal relationships, on whichrecommendations designed to prevent cancer can bebased, and evidence that is too limited in amount,consistency, or quality to be a basis for public and personalhealth recommendations, but which may nevertheless insome cases be suggestive of causal relationships. Food-based approach Since the 1990s a broad food- and drink-based approach tointerpreting the evidence on food, nutrition, and the risk ofcancer has increasingly been used, in contrast to theoverwhelming research emphasis on individual foodconstituents. The previous report included three chaptersshowing the findings on dietary constituents (including'energy and related factors', notably physical activity),foods and drinks, and food processing (meaningproduction, preservation, processing, and preparation), inthat order. This Report has taken a food-based approach, as shown throughout Chapter 4, more closely reflecting the nature ofthe evidence. Thus many findings on dietary constituentsand micronutrients, when their dietary sources are fromfoods rather than supplements, are here identified as, forexample, findings on 'foods containing dietary fibre' or'foods containing folate'. Findings on methods of foodprocessing are, wherever possible, shown as part of theevidence on the associated foods, so that, for example,meat processing is integrated with the evidence on meat.The evidence and judgements focused on cancer aresummarised and displayed in Chapter 7. Physical activity The scope of the work of this Panel is wider than that ofthe previous panel. The previous report judged that theevidence that physical activity protects against cancer ofthe colon was convincing. Since then evidence on physicalactivity (and physical inactivity, especially when thisamounts to generally sedentary ways of life) has becomemore impressive. Correspondingly, the review centres wererequested specifically to examine the literature on physicalactivity (and inactivity) as well as on foods and drinks. Theresults of this work, and the Panel's judgements, are shownin Chapter 5. Body fatness As with physical inactivity, the evidence that body fatness\u2014 including degrees of fatness throughout the range ofbody weight, from underweight and normal to overweightand obesity, as well as any specific effect of weight gain \u2014directly influences risk of some cancers has also becomemore impressive. The previous report judged that theevidence that greater body fatness (there termed 'high body mass') is a convincing or probable cause of cancers ofthe endometrium, breast (postmenopausal), and kidney.For this Report, the commissioned SLRs not only includedthe evidence linking body fatness directly with cancer, buta separate review was also commissioned specifically onthe biological and associated determinants of body fatnessitself. The evidence and the Panel's judgements, whichinclude assessment of the physiology of energymetabolism, are summarised in Chapters 6 and 8. The Panel is aware that weight gain, overweight, and obesity, and their antecedent behaviours, are criticallydetermined by social, cultural, and other environmentalfactors. This is one topic for the separate report on policyimplications to be published in late 2008. Cancer survivors There are increasing numbers of cancer survivors \u2014 peoplewho have at some time been diagnosed with cancer. Whatshould those people living with cancer do? Particularlysince the 1990s, this question is being asked increasingly,as more and more people are diagnosed with and treatedfor cancer, and are seeking ways in which they can add totheir medical or surgical management to help themselvesto remain healthy. Are the circumstances of people whohave recovered from cancer any different from those ofpeople who are free from cancer? Questions such as theseare addressed in Chapter 9. Life-course approach Unlike this Report, the reviews conducted for the firstreport did not consider the literature on food and nutritionin the first two years of life. Increasingly, evidence isaccumulating on the importance of early life-events onlater health. Evidence and judgements on the impact ofbirth weight and adult attained height on cancer risk arepresented in Chapter 6, though the detailed processesunderpinning these associations with cancer risk are notyet clear. Findings on the relationship between not beingbreastfed and later overweight and obesity in children arereported in Chapter 8, and on lactation and lower breastcancer risk in the mother are reported in Chapter 7. Thesefindings form part of a general 'life-course' approachsummarised in Chapter 2, reflecting an appreciation of theimportance of the accumulation of nutritional and otherexperiences throughout life, as well as genetic endowment,in influencing susceptibility to disease. Goals and recommendations The Panel's recommendations are set out in Chapter 12and in abbreviated form in the Summary, on the precedingpages. The previous report agreed 14 recommendations. This Report makes eight general and two specialrecommendations for specific target groups. These are setout in more detail than in the previous report. As before,principles that guide the goals and recommendations areset out. The recommendations themselves are displayed inboxes and are accompanied by text that justifies them, andxxvINTRODUCTION by practical guidance. The recommendations are addressed to people, as members of communities and families andalso as individuals. Recommendations and options addressed to UN and other international organisations, national governments,industry, health professional and civil society organisations,and the media are set out in the separate report on policyimplications, to be published in late 2008. AA nnoottee ooff ccaauuttiioonn The Panel is confident that its findings are soundly based, and that its recommendations, when translated intoeffective public policy programmes and personal choices,will reduce the risk of cancer. That said, the availableevident is imperfect. The Panel's conclusions derive fromthe best evidence now available, which reflects past andrecent research priorities mostly in high-income countries,though synthesised and judged in as meticulous andrigorous way as possible. What is here is therefore anincomplete picture. The tendency of reports such as this is to consider diseases in isolation. In the case of this Report, therelationship of weight gain, overweight, and obesity on therisk of some cancers is so clear that determinants of thesefactors have also been considered. But the Panel agrees , as evident in Chapters 10 and 12, that many chronic diseases,including type 2 diabetes and its precursors, cardiovasculardiseases and their precursors, and also perhaps otherdiseases of the digestive, musculoskeletal, and nervoussystems, are to a large extent caused by environmentalfactors, including inappropriate food and nutrition,physical inactivity, overweight and obesity, and associatedfactors. Following from this, future reports should considerthe promotion of health and the prevention of disease as awhole. HHooww mmuucchh ccaanncceerr iiss pprreevveennttaabbllee?? As shown in its title, the purpose of this Report is to prevent cancer. The term 'prevention' needs definition. Itdoes not mean the elimination of cancer. It meansreduction in its occurrence, such that at any age fewerpeople have cancer than otherwise would be the case. If all factors are taken into account, cancer is mostly a preventable disease. The authors of a landmark studypublished in the early 1980s concluded: 'It is highly likelythat the United States will eventually have the option ofadopting a diet that reduces its incidence of cancer byapproximately one third, and it is absolutely certain thatanother one third could be prevented by abolishingsmoking.' 3Cancers of some sites, notably of the colon, are generally agreed to be greatly or mostly affected by foodand nutrition. Since then, authoritative estimates of the preventability of cancer by means of food and nutrition and associatedfactors have been in broad agreement with the 'around onethird' figure. The estimate of the previous WCRF/AICRReport was that cancer is 30 to 40 per cent preventableover time, by appropriate food and nutrition, regularphysical activity, and avoidance of obesity. On a globalscale this represents over 3 to 4 million cases of cancer that can be prevented in these ways, every year. In many of its forms, cancer is a disease that can cause great suffering and claims many lives. The overallcommitment of scientists and other professionalscommitted to disease prevention, as exemplified by thisReport, is to reduce the rates not just of cancer, but of alldiseases, so that more people enjoy good health until theyeventually die in old age.

One is to explore the extent to which food, nutrition, physical activity, and body compositionmodify the risk of cancer, and to specify as far as possible the importance ofspecific factors. To the extent that environmental factors such as food, nutrition, and physical activity influence risk of cancer, it is a preventable disease. The Report specifies recommendations based on solid evidencewhich, when followed, will be expected to r educe the incidence of cancer . Part 1 of the Repor t begins with two chapters summarising the first lines of evidence from observations of human populations, and from experimental and basic science, pointing to the conclusion that cancer is preventable. Thethird chapter summarises the types of evidence that are relevant inidentifying the causes of cancer, and explains the process used by the Panelto assess the strength of this evidence and to come to judgement. Chapter 1 shows that patter ns of pr oduction and consumption of food and drink, of physical activity, and of body composition have changed greatly throughout dif ferent periods of human histor y. Remarkable changes have taken place as a result of urbanisation and industrialisation, at first in Europe, North America, and other economically advanced countries, andincreasingly in most countries in the world. With the establishment of reliable records in the second half of the 20th century, notable variations have been identified in patterns of cancerthroughout the world. Some cancers, such as those of the upperaerodigestive tract, stomach, liver, and cervix, are more common in lower income countries; others, such as those of the color ectum, br east, ovary, endometrium, pr ostate, and lung, ar e more common in higher income countries. More significant, as shown in Chapter 1, are studies consistently showing that patterns of cancer change as populations migrate from one part of the world to another and as countries become incr easingly urbanised and industrialised. Pr ojections indicate that rates of cancer in general ar e liable to increase. Chapter 2 outlines cur rent understanding of the biology of the cancer process, with special attention given to the ways in which food and nutrition, physical activity, and body composition may modify it. Cancer is a disease of genes, which are vulnerable to beneficial or harmful mutation, especially over the long human lifespan. Nutritional factors ar e impor tant in deter mining the likelihood of some mutations, as well as in changing the functions of genes even without mutation. However, both epidemiological and experimental evidence shows that only a smallpropor tion of cancers ar e inherited. Environmental factors are mostPART 1BACKGROUND Introduction to Part 13important and can be modified. These include smoking and other use of tobacco; infectious agents; radiation; industrial chemicals and pollution;medication \u2014 and also many aspects of food, nutrition, physical activity, andbody composition. Essentially this is good news. It means that healthy environments can stop cancer before it starts. The evidence also indicates that such environments, including the factors that are the subject of this Report,may be able to check the cancer pr ocess after it has star ted. The thir d chapter summarises the types of evidence that the Panel has agr eed are relevant to its work. No one study can prove that any factor definitely is a cause of or is protective against any disease. Also while some study designsare more reliable than others, they often cannot be used to answer many typesof question; so no one kind of study, however careful its methods, can everproduce definitive results. In this chapter, building on the work of the firstreport, the Panel shows that all study designs have strengths and weaknesses, and that r eliable judgements on causation of disease ar e based on assessment of a variety of well designed epidemiological and experimental studies. The judgements made by the Panel in Part 2 of this Report are based on independently commissioned and conducted systematic reviews of theliteratur e. This has ensur ed that the evidence has been assembled using methods that are as meticulous as possible, and that the display of theevidence is separated from assessments derived from this evidence, which aremade in Part 2. The pr evention of cancer worldwide is one of the most pressing challenges facing scientists and public health policy-makers, among others. Theseintroductor y chapters show that the challenge can be effectively addressed. They also suggest that food and nutrition, physical activity, and body composition all play a central part in the prevention of cancer. 4PART I BACKGROUND International variations and trends The first lines of evidence suggesting that cancer is a largely preventable disease have come fromstudies noting variations in cancer incidence acrosstime and place. The most impressive initial evidence showing that patterns of cancer are altered by environmental factors, and are not mainlygenetically deter mined, comes fr om studies describing changes in the rates of different cancers in genetically identical populations that migratefrom their native countries to other countries. Suchstudies consistently show that changes in the ratesof some of the most common cancers, includingthose of the stomach, colorectum, breast, andprostate, can be remarkable, even over one or twogenerations. This first intr oductor y chapter summarises current knowledge of the variations in food, nutrition, physical activity , body composition, and cancer in different parts of the world. This assessmentprovides strong circumstantial evidence thatcontinues to pr ompt systematic studies including interventions of various types, and also reports suchas this, which collect and judge the availableevidence. Such systematic work has already led theUnited Nations and other international bodies,national gover nments, and authoritative independent or ganisations to be confident that most cancers ar e lar gely preventable. Patterns of food and drink, of physical activity, and of body composition have changed remarkablythroughout human history. With industrialisation and urbanisation, food supplies usually become more secur e, and more food is available for consumption. In general, diets become mor e ener gy dense, containing fewer starchy foods, more fats and oils, sugars, and additives, and often more alcoholic drinks. At the same time, patter ns of physical activity change: populations become increasingly sedentary, their need for energy from food drops, and rates of overweight and obesityincrease. These changes cor relate with changes in the patter ns of cancer thr oughout the world. Middle- and low-income regions and countries within Africa, Asia, and Latin America have generally experiencedcomparatively high rates of cancers of the upperCHAPTER 1 aerodigestive tract (of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, nasopharynx, and oesophagus), and of the stomach,liver (primary), and cervix. Rates of some cancers,especially stomach cancer, are now generally decreasing. In contrast, high-income countries, and urbanised and industrialised ar eas of middle- and low-income regions and countries, have higher rates ofcolor ectal cancer and of hor mone-r elated cancers (of the breast, ovary, endometrium, and prostate). Lung cancer is now the most common type in the worldbecause of the increase in tobacco smoking andexposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Rates ofthese cancers, some of which may have beenhistorically rar e, are increasing. Globally , the number of people with cancer is projected to double by the year 2030, with most ofthis incr ease likely to occur in middle- and low- income countries. Such an increase would onlypartly be accounted for by the projected rise in thesize and average age of the global population. Thismakes the task of cancer prevention all the moreurgent and important.5CHAPTER 1 INTERNATIONAL VARIATIONS AND TRENDS This chapter outlines the historic, recent, and current varia- tions and trends in food, nutrition, physical activity, over-weight and obesity, and in patterns of cancer. People's diets reflect the times and situations in which they live. It is only relatively recently in history that urban-indus- trial ways of life have evolved, with many or most peopleliving in towns and cities rather than in the countr yside. In much of Africa and Asia, most people still live in rural com- munities, and peasant-agricultural and urban-industrial ways of life still coexist in most countries. Such patterns change very rapidly as countries become increasinglyurbanised and industrialised. The different food systems and diets that are part of these diverse ways of life affect people's levels of physical activity,their body composition and statur e, their life expectancy, and patterns of disease, including cancer . With the move to urban-industrial ways of life, populations have become taller and heavier , their life expectancy has incr eased, and they ar e usually adequately nourished (although poverty, and even destitution, remains a major problem in most big cities). Onthe other hand, urban populations ar e at incr eased risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and also some cancers. This chapter also summarises some available information on eight common cancers, irrespective of any recognised linksto food, nutrition , and physical activity; these factors are dealt with later in the R eport. F our are endemic in middle- and low- income countries: cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, liver , and cervix. Four are endemic in high-income countries, and are in general increasing in middle- and low-income countries:cancers of the lung, colon and r ectum, breast, and prostate. Information on the trends and projections of levels of physi- cal activity , and over weight and obesity, is summarised. Descriptive epidemiology , including studies of changing dis - ease patterns in migrant populations, is covered. These stud- ies can generate hypotheses about relationships between food,nutrition , physical activity , and the risk of cancer . However , they serve mainly as a foundation for studies that provide stronger evidence. The 12 national examples provided throughout this chap- ter summarise some of the trends in foods and drinks, obesi- ty, physical activity, and cancer in countries around the world. These ar e Egypt and South Africa (Africa); China, India, and Japan (Asia); the UK, Poland, and Spain (Europe); the USA, Brazil, and Mexico (the Americas); and Australia (Asia-Pacific). 1-471.1 Food systems and diets: historical and current Throughout history, food systems, and thus human diets, have been and are shaped by climate, terrain, seasons, loca- tion, culture, and technology. They can be grouped into threebroad types: gather er-hunter , peasant-agricultural, and urban-industrial. These food systems (for exam- ple, pastoralist, the semi-mobile farming of her ds of lar ge animals such as sheep and cattle) have their roots in histo- ry. All have coexisted in recent millennia with the exceptionof industrial food systems, which are the consequence of theindustrial revolution that began in Europe in the late 18thcentury. These systems still exist in the world today. 1.1.1 Gather er-hunter Since the emergence of Homo sapiens around 250000 years ago, gather er-hunter food systems have tak en differ ent forms, depending on the environments in which people lived. These systems still exist in parts of the world that are remotefrom cities and r oads. They supply diets that usually include moderate amounts of starchy foods, and which are high in dietary fibre and low in sugar, mostly from fruits andhoney. 48Methods of food preparation include pulverising, drying, and roasting. These diets are usually high in foodsof animal origin (ranging fr om large animals to insects, and also fish and other seafood, depending on location), and thus in animal pr otein . It is sometimes thought that gatherer-hunter diets are high in fat, which is not the case because wild animals are lean. Recent analyses suggest thatgather ed food generally provides rather more dietary bulk and energy than hunted food. 49 People in gather er-hunter societies are necessarily physi- cally active, and ar e often tall and usually lean (only chiefs, or old or incapacitated people might be overweight or obese). The diets of food-secure gatherer-hunter societiesmay be diverse and high in micr onutrients. 50 51Diets ar e liable to become monotonous and deficient in various nutri- ents, as well as in energy, when food supplies are chronicallyinsecure, or at times of acute food shortage. It is sometimes claimed that gatherer-hunter food systems generate diets to which the human species is best adapted. 48However , life expectancy in gather er-hunter societies is and has been usu - ally relatively low. Evidence of cancer has occasionally been found in human and other fossil and ancient r emains.52Historically , cancer 6PART I BACKGROUND In 2004 Egypt had a population of just over 74 million. Nearly the whole population lives within the Nile Valley and the NileDelta, less than 4 per cent of the country'stotal area. Egypt has a lower-middle-income economy, with a gross domestic product of 4274 international dollars per person (figure1.3). Life expectancy at birth is 66 years formen and 70 for women (figure 1.1). 46 Chronic diseases account for 83.6 per cent of deaths, while infectious diseases,maternal, perinatal, and nutritional condi-Egypt of any type seems to have been uncommon among gather - er-hunter peoples, if only because their average life expectancy was low. In modern gatherer-hunter societies,the incidence of cancer rises after contact with industrialisedand urbanised ways of life, which usually involve shifts inpatterns of diet and physical activity. 53These points gener- ally also apply to pastoralist societies. 1.1.2 Peasant-agricultural In recent millennia, and until ver y recently in history, almost all human populations have been rural and mostly peas - ant-agricultural, and the majority still are in most regions of Asia, many regions of Africa, and some parts of LatinAmerica. P easant-agricultural food systems involving the cul- tivation of wheat may have first developed around 9000 years ago in the 'F ertile Cr escent' of the Middle East, includ- ing the r egion between the T igris and Euphrates rivers (with - in modern Iraq). These systems also developed independently in Asia, with rice as the staple food, and inthe Americas, with corn (maize) as the staple. 54The k ey fac - tor in these systems is land settlement, itself determined by the cultivation and breeding of crops and also animals, birds,and fish for human consumption and use. 55In and around Egypt, people began to make bread from wheat about 6000 years ago .56 Typically , diets derived fr om these systems ar e plant-based: they are high or very high in cereals (grains), complement- ed with animal sources of protein. These diets are thereforehigh in star chy foods and usually in dietar y fibr e (unless thecereals ar e refined). They include var ying amounts of foods of animal origin, and of vegetables and fruits, depending on relative food security. Surplus food is stored for consump-tion in winter and during har d times, and methods of food preparation also include fermentation, used for foods as well as for the production of alcoholic drinks (see chapters 4.8and 4.9). The dominant indigenous cereal crop varies in different parts of the world: wheat is gr own in the Middle East; bar- ley, rye, and oats in colder, northern climates; millet and rice in Asia; maize (corn) in the Americas; and sor ghum and teff in Africa. Indigenous staple crops also include roots and tubers such as cassava (manioc), yams, potatoes, and alsoplantains. Pulses (legumes) ar e also farmed to ensure agri- cultural and nutritional balance; and other crops such as vegetables and fruits ar e also cultivated. Bir ds and animals are domesticated and br ed for food, and fish and seafood contribute to the diets of communities living beside water. 57 As with gatherer-hunters, the diets of peasant-agricul- tural societies may be diverse and high in micr onutrients. Again, when food supplies are chronically insecure, or at times of acute food shortage (including times of war), dietsare liable to become monotonous and deficient in various nutrients, as well as in energy. Peasant-agricultural societies are necessarily physically active, although not constantly so : the main times of inten - sive physical work include building field systems, sowing, harvesting, and storing. The level of energy balance and ofphysical activity varies gr eatly, depending in part on how dif - Age-standardised rates of common cancers Egypt Age-standardised rate per 100 000 Data from International Agency for Research on Cancer20LungBladder Liver Breast Bladder010203040 CervixMen Women Non-communicable causes of death Egypt Data from World Health Organization46Cardiovascular disease Cancer Respiratory disease Diabetes OtherPer cent of deaths 58 972247CHAPTER 1 INTERNATIONAL VARIATIONS AND TRENDS tions account for 12.2 per cent; 4.2 per cent of deaths are due to injuries. The first fig- ure gives a breakdown of deaths caused bychronic diseases. 46 Bladder cancer is the most common type of cancer in men, followed by cancers of thelung and liver. 20In women, the dominant cancers include those of the breast, cervix, and bladder (for age-standardised rates ofthese cancers, see the second figure). 20The high incidence of bladder cancer is likely to be related to bilharzia, a parasitic infectionof the bladder. 20There is also a high inci- dence of hepatitis C virus, a cause of liver cancer.20Also see box 7.8.1 It is predicted that there will be a 3.5-fold increase in liver cancer by 2030.12 For the period 1991-1994, 46 per cent of men and 48 per cent of women between the ages of 20 and 44 wer e classified as sedentary.46In 2003, women aged 15-49 had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 28.6.In teenagers (13-19 year olds), average BMI was 23.9; women in their 30s had a mean BMI of 29.0, while those over 45 had a BMIof 31.3. In total, 77.3 per cent of women aged 15-49 had a BMI of over 25. In 1992,23.5 per cent of all women had a BMI of over 30. By 2000, this figure had risen to 41 per cent. 46Fewer data are available for men, but in 1994, the mean BMI for men aged 20-44 was 26.6, rising to 28.4 for men over 45. In 2002, among all men, 45 per cent had a BMI of between 25 and 29.99 and 20 per cent had a BMI of over 30. 15See figure 1.4 for projections of the proportions of men and women pre- dicted to have a BMI of 30 or more in 2015.46 The average amount of available food energy rose between 1964 and 2004, from around 2240 to 3290 kcal/person per day (9400 to 13 800 kJ/person per day).1Early dietary studies in Egypt demonstrated that corn bread was the staple food and that protein intake was about 100 g/day.15 People fr om higher-income households consumed more dairy products and those from urban households consumed a wider variety of foods. Between 1950 and 1990,there was a shift towards a dependence on wheat rather than other cereals (grains),and a sustained rise in the consumption of meat, fish, and dairy products. 15Consumption of sugars and oils increased substantially and pulses (legumes) decreased in importance.15Since the 1970s, consumption of all major food groups has increased. However, between 1990 and 1994 there was a 20 per cent decrease intotal household food consumption, because subsidies were removed and food prices rose sharply. 15A national study in 1981 found that only 24 per cent of urban and 15 per cent of rural households ate ready- made foods, and meat was eaten more fre-quently in urban households compared with rural households. 15A repeat survey in 1998 found that poultry had become the main source of animal protein and that wheat bread was the most popular type, although homemade wheat-maize bread was common in rural areas. Another study highlighted dif ferences in dietary fat intake: in urban women, 27.5 per cent of dietar y ener gy came from fat (mainly as vegetable oil) compared with 22.5 per centin rural women. 15Between 1981 and 1998, people increasingly ate meals away fromhome (20.4 per cent of all meals in 1981 compared with 45.8 per cent in 1998). 15 ficult it is to cultivate the land. The degr ee of physical activ - ity and so of body mass in peasant-agricultural communi- ties depends mostly on relative food security.58 People in these societies who ar e prosper ous, especially those who own land farmed by others, may quite often become overweight or obese. But in general, and largelybecause of the nature of their dietary staples, peasant-agri-culturalists are usually short and lean. This is still evident inrural peasant communities whose food systems r emain tra- ditional: for instance, in Africa, Latin America, and in Asia,notably India and China. 58 Agriculture enabled the development of towns and then cities: throughout the world, walled, urban settlementsbecame surr ounded by fields cultivated by peasants. These people subsisted on the food they produced, and the surplus fed the community living within the walls. In times of war , the fortified settlement became a r efuge for the farmers. This crowding of populations into towns and cities caused a sharp rise in the rates of infectious diseases, mostly notably amonginfants and young childr en, pregnant and lactating women , and infirm and old people. 59 The average life expectancy of peasant-agriculturists in general is probably a little longer than that of gatherer-hunters, with a greater percentage of people surviving into what would be regarded as late-middle and old age. The prevalence and incidence of various cancers in tradi- tional rural societies is often uncertain, even following theestablishment of cancer r egisters in many countries: r ecordsare less r eliable than those k ept in urbanised societies. But there is reasonable evidence that relatively common cancers in peasant-agricultural societies include those causallyassociated with chr onic infections, such as cancers of the stomach, liver, and cervix. 60 1.1.3 Urban-industrial Indigenous or traditional peasant-agricultural systems have coexisted with urban-industrial food systems in most coun - tries since the cr eation and gr owth of cities, and the begin- ning of the 'industrial r evolution '. This movement started in Europe in the 18th century, and then spread to North America and elsewhere. Britain is one exception to this coex-istence: it was the first countr y to become mostly urban, with hired workers replacing peasants on increasingly large and relatively mechanised farms. The Americas ar e another exception: settlers, mostly fr om Eur ope, displaced native populations and developed mechanised agricultural sys- tems. 61In continental Europe, some balance between rural and urban ways of life has been pr eserved. Thr oughout the Mediterranean coastal regions, and in the Middle East, mod- ern food systems have deep, historical roots.62In most of Africa and Asia, including countries with large cities, the basic economies and cultures have remained predominantly rural, but this is changing.63 Urban-industrial food systems have characteristics distinct from peasant-agricultural and gatherer-hunter systems. Their original purpose was to ensure reliable and adequatesupplies of food of an agr eed minimum nutritional quality8PART I BACKGROUND to entir e populations. T echnology has been the main driving force behind these systems. For instance, various food-preser- vation techniques were developed as part of the industrialrevolution, and there has been further innovation since thattime. These include bottling, canning, refrigeration, andpackaging; the extensive use of sugar and salt; and tech - nologies that suppr ess, convert, or eliminate perishable qual - ities in fr esh foods (see chapters 4.6 and 4.9). The clearing of land to rear cattle and sheep, and the development of rail- ways, refrigeration, and other technologies, have made meat,milk, and their pr oducts cheap and plentiful all year round. Sugar derived from cane is the most profitable edible cash crop, and sugars and syrups made fr om cane, beet, and now also corn ar e used to sweeten and pr eserve br eakfast foods, baked foods, desserts, soft drinks, and a vast array of other manufactured products. 64 65Steel roller mills, invented in the 1870s, separate the components of wheat and enable pr o- duction of uniform quality white bread, which has become a staple food.66Hydrogenation, which converts oils to hard fats (see chapter 4.5), has made margarine a basic item of food, and provides ingredients used in the manufacturing of many pr ocessed foods.67Perhaps the most remarkable change following the industrialisation of food systems hasbeen the precipitate drop in breastfeeding. 68At various times, urban-industrial food systems have been adjusted inresponse to the then curr ent knowledge of nutrition and pub -lic health r ecommendations, notably when food security has been threatened by wars. 69 Urban-industrial food systems generate relatively energy- dense diets. These are fairly high in meat, and milk and theirproducts, and in total fats, hardened fats, processed starch-es and sugars, salt, bak ed goods, soft drinks, and often also alcoholic drinks. These diets ar e relatively low in both dietar y fibr e and starchy staple foods, other than products made from wheat, which has become the dominant cereal in most countries outside Asia and Africa. Recent advancesin food technology have further alter ed patterns of food pro- duction and consumption, particularly in high-income countries. P atterns of pr oduction and consumption of vegetables and fruits and fish var y between differ ent urban-industrial food systems, depending on factors such as climate and geographical location. 70 Efficient urban-industrial food systems can ensur e the constant supply of food to all sections of the population, even to the lowest-income and marginalised groups. In high-er-income countries and regions, this, together with basic public health initiatives, has helped to greatly reduce rates of nutritional deficiencies and other diseases, which peopleare mor e vulnerable to if they have inadequate food supplies. As a result of these food systems, people have become gen- erally taller and heavier. Since the industrial r evolution , as populations have moved In 2001 South Africa had a population of nearly 47.5 million.3The country has a mid- dle-income economy, with a gross domesticproduct of 8506 international dollars per person (figure 1.3), which masks extreme socioeconomic inequalities. 46Life expectan- cy at birth is 47 years for men and 49 forwomen (figure 1.1).46 Chronic diseases account for 53.9 per cent of deaths, while infectious diseases, maternal,perinatal, and nutritional conditions account for 40.2 per cent; 5.9 per cent of deaths are due to injuries. The figure below gives a break-down of deaths caused by chronic diseases. 46The most common cancers in men are those of the prostate, lung, oesophagus, colorectum, and bladder.20Since HIV and AIDS became epidemic, Kaposi's sarcoma has become more common in both men and women. For women, the most common cancers are those of the cervix, breast,South Africa Non-communicable causes of death South Africa Data from World Health Organization46Cardiovascular disease Cancer Respiratory disease Diabetes OtherPer cent of deaths 51 2010713 Age-standardised rates of South Africa common cancers Age-standardised rate per 100 000 Data from International Agency for Research on 1 INTERNATIONAL VARIATIONS AND TRENDS from rural to urban ar eas, ther e have been rapid and pr o- found changes in both the nature and quality of their foods and drinks, and the patterns of diseases they suffer.71 Urban-industrial food systems have evidently improved peo- ple's strength and health in early life. They are also a factorin the doubling of average life expectancy since 1800, andthe incr ease in global population fr om around 1 billion in 1800 to 6.5 billion in 2006. 72The range of curr ent life expectancy in selected countries is illustrated in figure 1.1. In the second half of the 20th century, attention focused on the appar ent ill-effects of these food systems on people, mostly in later life. By the 1980s, it was generally agreed that these industrialised diets incr ease the risk of some chr onic diseases, usually of later life, which had become common orepidemic in higher-income industrialised countries. These included obesity, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease.At the same time, in examining patterns of both diet and can - cer across the world, and among migrants, it was increas- ingly thought that these diets were partly responsible forsome cancers, notably those of the colon and rectum, breast, ovary, endometrium, and prostate. 73-75 In the last decades of the 20th centur y, the demographic, nutritional, and epidemiological transitions that had, untilthen, largely been apparent only in higher-income countries became global. Since the 1990s, and outside Europe, NorthAmerica, and other high-income countries, economic glob - colorectum, lung, and oesophagus (for age- standardised rates of these cancers, see the second figure).20Diseases of poverty and chronic diseases coexist, but it is predicted that by 2010, deaths from AIDS will account for twice as many deaths as those from allother causes combined. 5 41 For the period 2002-2003, 44 per cent of men and 49 per cent of women aged 18-69were classified as sedentary (figure 1.6). 46 Some regional studies suggest that young women who did not finish school have lowlevels of physical activity. 24There is a lack of physical education in schools, and poor environment and high crime rates prevent leisure activity outside school.24 In 1998 men aged 15-24 had an average body mass index (BMI) of 21.1; for those aged 35-65, average BMI remained con- stant at ar ound 25. Just 7.8 per cent of men aged 25-34 had a BMI of over 30 compared with 17.3 per cent of men aged 45-54. Inthe same year, women aged 15-24 had an average BMI of 23.7; for those aged 35-64, average BMI remained constant at around29. In women aged 25-34, 27 per cent had a BMI of over 30 compared with 45 per cent of women aged 45-64. 46Although under- nutrition remains a problem among rural children, obesity and associated diseases arealso prevalent. There has been a miscon- ception of 'benign obesity': being thin is associated with HIV and AIDS, and moder-ately overweight women are thought of as attractive and affluent. 24Overall, in 1998, 21.1 per cent of men and 25.9 per cent ofwomen had a BMI of at least 25; 10.1 per cent of men and 27.9 per cent of women had a BMI of at least 30. See figure 1.4 forprojections of the proportions of men and women who will have a BMI of 30 or more in 2015. The average amount of available food energy rose between 1964 and 2004, from around 2700 to 3000 kcal/person per day (11 400 to 12600 kJ/person per day). In the same period, sugar consumption dropped from 420 to 370 kcal/person per day (1800 to 1500 kJ/person per day). 1The National Food Consumption sur vey of 1999 found that stunting was the most common nutri- tional disor der, affecting almost one fifth of children aged 1-9, with the lowest levels inurban areas. There was a similar pattern for underweight, where 10 per cent of childrenaged 1-3 consumed less than half of their suggested daily dietary needs, and 26 per cent consumed less than two thirds. 25In rural areas, adults from lower-income households were shorter and had a lowerBMI, and commonly consumed foods were maize, sugar, tea, milk, and brown bread. Urban households ate less maize porridgebut more vegetables and fruits, animal- based products, and fats and oils. It was only in urban areas that fruits and milkappeared in the top 10 list of foods and drinks consumed by more than 85 per cent of people. In men, alcoholic drinks made asignificant contribution to dietary energy (10-14 per cent). People living in rural areas obtained a higher proportion of totaldietary energy from carbohydrates, where- as the most urbanised populations derived one third of their energy from animal foods high in protein. Urbanisation is generally accompanied by an improvement in micronutrient intakes, but this way of life is also associat- ed with incr eases in overweight and obesi- ty. 44Other studies have suggested shifts towar ds a W estern dietary pattern in peo- ple living in both urban and rural areas, typ-ified by a decrease in starchy foods and dietary fibre consumption, and an increasein fat. They have also shown that half of the population does not eat the locally recommended four portions of fruits and vegetables each day, while a quarter eats none. 10 Life expectancy at birth AfricaAsia-Pacific North AmericaFigure 1.1 Women MenEgypt South Africa Japan China India Australia Spain UK Poland USA Mexico Brazil0102030405060708090Asia Europe Latin America Data from World Health Organization46Years10PART I BACKGROUND alisation is thought to be the single main force shifting populations from the countryside into cities, changing thedominant food systems from peasant-agricultural tourban-industrial, and transforming patterns of disease. Thisphenomenon includes the unpr ecedented and accelerating movement of money , goods, and ideas. All this has been made possible by new international, political, and econom - ic policies, by the creation of supranational regulatory bod- ies such as the World Trade Organization, and by theelectr onic revolution. 76-78 People's levels of physical activity have also changed dra- matically as a r esult of the move fr om peasant-agricultural to urban-industrial ways of life. In 1950, the UN 'r eference man' weighing 65 kg (143 lbs) was estimated to be in ener- gy balance at an average [kJ]/day); the 'r eference woman' weighing 55 kg (121 lbs) was estimated to be in energy balance at 2300 kcal/day (9630 kJ/day). Today in the USA, average weightsare much higher, yet the figure for the 'reference person' (men and women combined) is taken to be 2000 kcal/day (8374 kJ/day) for the purposes of nutrition food labelling. The r ea- son for this dr op in human ener gy requir ements is because three of the four settings for physical activity \u2014 occupation- al, household, and transport \u2014 (see Chapter 5) have becomeincreasingly mechanised. Ener gy-dense food systems, essen -tial to sustain young populations that walk or cycle to work that is physically demanding, are unsuitable for ageing pop-ulations who sit for most of the day, even if they engage insome recreational physical activity. There is some evidence that these very recently introduced urban-industrial food systems have lower ed the rates of nutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases of early lifein middle- to low-income countries and regions. But the apparent impact on the rates of chronic diseases in theseareas is of increasing public health concern. In most of these regions, with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa, childhood overweight, obesity , and type 2 diabetes have become com- mon and, in some countries, epidemic. 70 The Panel emphasises that there is no reason to think that urban-industrial food systems are intrinsically harmful. Theywere first developed using r elatively crude technologies, and at a time when something was known of their positive impact on growth and strength, but little of their long-termimpact on health. Since then, many new technologies have been developed, and there is a clearer understanding that some methods of pr eserving and processing food are bene- ficial, wher eas others ar e a factor in incr easing the risk of disease. Future developments can ensure universal food security, avoid earlier mistakes, and reduce the risk of chron-ic diseases, including cancer . In 2004 China had a population of over 1.3 billion. The one-child policy introduced in 1979 has reduced annual populationgrowth to 1.07 per cent. The United Nations estimates that the population will have increased to nearly 1.5 billion by 2025. 46The country has a lower-middle-income econo- my, with a gross domestic product of 5581international dollars per person (figure1.3). Life expectancy at birth is 70 years for men and 74 for women (figure 1.1). 46 Chronic diseases account for 78.9 per cent of deaths, while infectious diseases, mater- nal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions account for 11.7 per cent; 9.3 per cent of deaths are due to injuries.46The figure below gives a breakdown of deaths causedby chronic diseases. 46A study published in2004 found that there has been a shift towards nutrition-related chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardio-vascular disease. 14 Stomach cancer is the most common type of cancer in men, although it has declined slightly since 1980.20Lung cancer has risen steadily over the same period.20Liver cancer has risen since 1990, although levels are nowChina Age-standardised rates of common cancers China Age-standardised rate per 100 000 Data from International Agency for Research on Cancer20ColorectumLiver BreastLungStomachMen WomenOesophagus Lung01020304045 5152535 Stomach Liver Oesophagus Non-communicable causes of death China Data from World Health Organization46Cardiovascular disease Cancer Respiratory disease Diabetes OtherPer cent of deaths 4422 2221011CHAPTER 1 INTERNATIONAL VARIATIONS AND TRENDS 1.2 Foods and drinks, physical activity, body composition 1.2.1 Foods and drinks Substantial changes have occurr ed in the patterns of foods and drinks supplied and consumed thr oughout the world, and these changes ar e becoming incr easingly rapid. Also see Chapter 4. Economic development is generally accompanied by quantitative and qualitative changes in food supplies and therefore in diets. This 'nutrition transition' may reduce the risk of some dietar y deficiencies and impr ove overall nutri- tion. But it can also be accompanied by adverse shifts in the composition of diets, for instance, with a greater proportion of energy coming from fats and oils, and added sugars. Overrecent years, such dietar y changes have been rapid in the middle- and low-income countries of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. 63 79 80 The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN records global differences in the availability of food crops and commodities (bo x 1.1). These data provide information on the average amounts of food available for consumption , rather than actual food consumption. Animal products have traditionally made up a small proportion of food availabili-ty in low-income countries; most dietar y ener omplant sources such as roots and tubers, cereals (grains), and fruits. However, this pattern is changing, with proportionally more dietary energy available for consumption now comingfrom animal sources. Since the 1960s, estimates for animal sources for low-income countries have risen fr om around 160 to 340 kcal/day (670 to 1400 kJ/day). During the sameperiod, estimates of the energy available for consumption from plant sources have also risen, from 1900 to 2340kcal/day (7900 to 9800 kJ/day) (figur e 1.2). There have been similar changes in the availability of both animal and plant sour ces of ener gy in high-income countries. However, in these cases, the pr oportion of ener gy from animal sour ces is much greater: around one third or 940 kcal/day (3900 kJ/day). 81The proportion of dietary energy available from cereals (grains) has r emained constant at ar ound 50 per cent, though dietary energy available from cereals (grains), in particular rice and wheat, have decreased slightly in low-income countries. This trend is likely to continue until the 2030s in middle- and low-income countries. 81 Large variations exist across the world in the amounts of fat available for consumption . The highest availability is in Europe and North America; the lowest is in Africa. The quan- tity of available fat in diets has increased globally since the1960s, with the ex ception of sub-Saharan Africa. 81These stabilising.20The incidence of cancer of the oesophagus has remained stable since the 1980s and cancers of the colorectum are alsorelatively common. 20For women, the most common cancers are those of the lung, stomach, and breast, which have risensteadily since the 1980s; of the liver, which has risen since 1990; and of the oesophagus. For age-standardised rates of these cancers,see the second figure. 20 For the period 2002-2003, 10 per cent of men and 12 per cent of women aged 18-69 were classified as sedentary (figure 1.6).46 These figures are likely to increase, with fur- ther urbanisation and greater use of vehi- cles for transport. Between 1980 and 2003, the number of cars produced in China quadrupled to more than 2 million.84 In 1997 men aged 24-64 had an average body mass index (BMI) of ar ound 25; just 2.1 per cent of men aged 20-74 had a BMI of over 30. In the same year , women aged 25-29 had an average BMI of 22.2, andthose aged 35-64 had a BMI of around 25. Just 3.7 per cent of women had a BMI ofover 30. 46In 2002, 18.9 per cent of men and women aged 18 and above had a BMI of over 25, and 2.9 per cent of them had a BMIof over 30. See figure 1.4 for projections of the proportions of men and women who will have a BMI of 30 or mor e in 2015. The average amount of available foodenergy rose between 1964 and 2004, from around 1850 to 2940 kcal/person per day (7760 to 12 290 kJ/person per day). This islargely due to an increase in the availabili- ty of fats and oils, meat, and sugar. 1The 1957-1962 famine was followed by a liber-alisation of food production. Economic growth has reduced poverty and Chinese diets now are influenced by the Westernpattern: cereals (grains) and lower-fat mixed dishes are being replaced with animal foods and edible fats. 14Recent national nutrition- al surveys show that energy intake from ani- mal sources increased from 8 per cent in 1982 to 25 per cent in 2002, and that ener- gy from fat, particularly among people liv- ing in urban areas, increased from 25 to 35 per cent over the same period.84Intake of cereals (grains) has also decreased substan- tially since the mid-1980s among urban and rural populations, with a larger decrease inthe consumption of coarse grains compar ed with refined varieties. The biggest drop incereal intake has been among people in the lowest-income groups. Vegetable and fruitintakes have decr eased since 1989, although they are highest in urban populations. Fat intake is also increasing and many adultsobtain 30 per cent or more of their overall energy intake from fat. 14Regional varia- tions also exist: for example, the dietary pat-tern around the city of Hangzhou is ver yvaried, resulting in a diet low in saturated fatty acids and high in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; people there eat green, leafyvegetables with almost every meal. 26The incidence of nutrition-related diseases and deaths from these diseases are lower in thisregion than in other parts of China. Snacking contributes minimal energy intake to Chinese diets (0.9 per cent).However, snacking and eating food away from home are increasing among children from middle- and high-income groups.Foods commonly eaten away from home include cereals (grains), vegetables and fruits, meat, eggs, and fish. Between 1991 and 1997, the proportion of children from low-income households eating foods away from home did not change, but there was an increase among children from higher- income gr oups, with a 10 per cent increase in the consumption of foods from animal sources eaten away fr om home. Eating food prepared away from home accounted for 15per cent of total energy intake for all Chinese children during this period. 27 Despite these statistics, only 10 per cent of Chinese children and young people con- sumed any snacks during the study period,and there was little evidence then that they consumed significant amounts of soft drinks, although this is now changingrapidly .12PART I BACKGROUND changes are accounted for by an increase in the availability and consumption of plant oils in lower-income countries.82 Palm oil intak e is incr easing in South-East Asia, and olive oil is now consumed widely in Europe and not just in Mediterranean countries. Analysis of food balance sheet data suggests that available energy for consumption has increased steadily on a world-wide basis. Since the 1960s, this has incr eased globally by approximately 450 kcal/person per day (1900 kJ/person per day), and by mor e than 600 kcal/person per day (2500 kJ/person per day) in low-income countries. 81Regional dif- ferences exist. For example, there has been little change insub-Saharan Africa, and in Asia the amount of available ener - gy has risen dramatically: in China by almost 1000 kcal/per- son per day (4200 kJ/person per day). These data need tobe interpr eted with caution , as they do not r elate dir ectly to energy consumption (box 1.1). Global average available energy is predicted to rise from around 2800 kcal/person perday (1 1700 kJ/person per day) (1997-1999 average) to 2940 (12 300 kJ) in 2015, and to 3050 (12 800 kJ) in 2030. Again, see box 1.1. With increasing socioeconomic status, the proportion of energy in diets from staples such as cereals (grains) and roots and tubers declines, wher eas the proportion of energy from fats and oil, and animal pr otein (including fr om meat, milk, and eggs) increases. For example, in China, energy intake from foods of animal origin has increased significantly: theaverage Chinese adult now consumes mor e than 1300 kcal/day (5400 kJ/day) from these foods.83In low-income countries between the 1960s and 1990s, consumption ofmeat r ose by 150 per cent, and of milk and dair y products by 60 per cent. By 2030, it is predicted that consumption of animal products could rise by a further 44 per cent, with thebiggest contribution coming from poultry. If stocks of fish canbe maintained, fish consumption is likely to rise by 19-20kg/person in the same period. Owing to decr eases in the cost of these foods in r eal terms, low-income countries have high - er levels of meat and fat consumption at much lower levelsof gross domestic product (GDP) than was the case in coun- tries that underwent socioeconomic transition in the 1960sand 1970s. F igure 1.3 shows the GDP of selected countries. According to food consumption surveys, only a minority of the world's adult population consumes the commonly r ec- ommended minimum daily amount of vegetables and fruitsof 400 g/person. Low-income countries have the lowest intakes of vegetables and fruits, and vegetables are general-ly mor e readily available than fruits. 43In India, for example, levels of vegetable and fruit intake have remained static at 120-140 g/day. Australia, Japan, and North America havehigh levels of intake, for example 300 g/day in Australia. In Europe, average consumption is between 250 and 350 g/day \u2014 often much higher in Mediterranean countries, forinstance 550 g/day in Spain \u2014 and Scandinavian countries have particularly high fruit intakes. 43Countries in Europe, Latin America, North America, and South-East Asia have seenan incr ease in the availability of vegetables and fruits for con - Gross domestic product per capita, North AmericaSouth Africa Egypt Japan China India Australia UK Spain Poland USA Mexico BrazilFigure 1.3 Data from World Health Organization46 Food energy from animal and plant food sources in selected low-, middle-, and high-income countries, 1967-1999Current gross domestic product per capita for selected countries in international dollars Changes in available energy from animal and plant food sourcesFigure 1.2 low income transitionTotal Plant Animal0500100015002000250030003500 Total Plant Animal Total Plant Animal 1967-1969 1977-79 1987-89 1997-99 Data from Food and Agriculture Organization1Low income High income Middle income kcal13CHAPTER 1 INTERNATIONAL VARIATIONS AND TRENDS sumption since the 1960s. In contrast, in eastern and cen- tral Africa, availability has decr eased since the mid-1980s. Studies in children suggest that their eating patterns vary around the world. For instance, children living in the USAand the Philippines consume one thir d of their daily ener gy away from home, and snacks provide one fifth of their daily energy. In contrast, children living in Russia and China eatvery little food away from the home. Snacks provide about16 per cent of dietary energy for Russian children, butaccount for only 1 per cent in Chinese childr en. 2 A US study showed that between 1977 and 2001, con - sumption of sweetened drinks incr eased by 135 per cent. During the same period, milk consumption decreased by 38 per cent, resulting in an overall daily increase of 278 kcal(1164 kJ) fr om drinks. 31 1.2.2 Over weight and obesity There have been rapid changes in rates of over weight and obesity throughout the world since the 1980s, at the same time as the urbanisation and industrialisation of middle- andlow-income countries. Such countries often experience the dual burden of nutritional deficiencies and chronic diseases. Also see Chapters 6 and 8. The most recent estimates suggest that in 2002 there were 1 billion overweight or obese people worldwide, with Chinese people accounting for appr oximately one fifth. The example of China is r emarkable. Historically , China, which is classed as a lower-middle-income economy by the World Bank, had a lean population. But the prevalence of under-weight adults has decr eased and the numbers of people whoare either overweight or obese have risen considerably. In 2002, ther e wer e 184 million over weight and 31 million obese people in China, out of a population of 1.3 billion. 14 The prevalence of overweight and obesity among 7-18 year olds incr eased substantially between 1985 and 2000.84 Between 1989 and 1997, one study estimated that the pro- portion of overweight and obese men in China rose from 6.4to 14.5 per cent, and in women from 11.5 to 16.2 per cent. 85 Another study, in nine Chinese provinces, found that between 1989 and 2000 ther e was a 13.7 per cent increase in the pr oportion of men , and a 7.9 per cent increase in the proportion of women , who were overweight or obese. During the same period, there was an average 2 per cent decrease in the number of men and women who were clas-sified as under weight. 86 The World Health Organization MONICA Project moni- tored 10 million adults in 21 countries over a 10-year peri - od in the 1980s and 1990s. During this time, the mean bodymass index (BMI) increased in most populations, with the largest increases in regions of Australia and the USA. Overthe course of the pr oject, the overall average BMI incr eased by 1.5. 87However, average BMI decreased in Russia and Central Europe, and in certain regions of Italy andSwitzerland. The UK has one of the highest rates of excess weight in Europe. This has increased threefold since 1980; in 2003, 65 per cent of men and 56 per cent of women wer e overweight, with 22 per cent of men and 23 per cent of women classified as obese. 88 Historically, food insecurity, undernutrition, and under- weight, and their lik ely contribution to infection , have been The data here on energy, foods, and drinks are taken from food balance sheets com- piled by the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations. These are statistical data on the production, trade, and use of agricultural commoditiesfor all countries. Food balance sheets are the most common and widely used data sets for food supply estimates. A food bal-ance sheet provides estimates of the food available for human consumption, and an overall picture of a country's food supply during a specified period of time, which can be compared between countries. It follows that these estimates of avail- ability are not measures of consumption. They record information about the supply of food (production, imports, stock changes, and exports) and about how it is used (as feed and seed, in processing, andwastage, as well as food). The amounts of foods and drinks recorded on these bal- ance sheets are expressed 'per person' (inkg/person per year or kcal/person per day). The estimates in food balance sheets that need to be tr eated with most cautionare those of energy. Balance sheets over- estimate food consumption in high-income countries, where substantial amounts offood are wasted or fed to pets. They underestimate consumption in countries that are not dominated by urban-industri-al food systems, and where many people grow their own food, raise animals, or gather wild food such as fungi and berries.It follows that balance sheet data showing increases in food energy over time tend to reflect economic development and greater use of money, rather than actual increases in availability. The accuracy of a food balance sheet also depends on the reliability of the underlying statistics of supply, use, and population. Also, the data do not take into account regional differences, so the infor- mation may not be representative of theentir e countr y. In countries wher e ther e is wide variation in income and food access, for example, the overall supply picture pro-vided by the balance sheet is of limited use. In such cases, food balance sheets can be complemented with national nutritionsurveys or household income/expenditure surveys. Household income/expenditure surveys, such as the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study, look at multiple aspects of household welfare and behav-iour, and collect data on the quantities of food purchased by a representative sample of households. These surveys providedetailed information about foods con- sumed in and away from the home over a limited time period, and can be used to document differences in regional, geo- graphical, or household socioeconomiccharacteristics. While these surveys are generally more useful than food balance sheets for assessing household consump- tion, they are less readily available. Balance sheets are often available for a large num- ber of countries and for most years. Food balance sheets, household income/ expenditure surveys, and methods of assess- ing individual dietary intakes (see Chapter3) all provide information on food supply and consumption, and they have different purposes, uses, and limitations.Box 1.1 Measurement of food supply and consumption 14PART I BACKGROUND the main nutrition-r elated public health issues in middle- and low-income countries. This is no longer the case. Thus, surveys of women between 1992 and 2000 found that overweight exceeds underweight in most middle- and low- income countries, including those in North Africa and theMiddle East, Central Asia, China, and Latin America. Indeed,there has been a disproportionate increase in, and prevalenceof, obesity among the lowest-income groups in most coun-tries. It is more likely that people will be overweight if theylive in urban areas compared with rural areas, and countrieswith a higher GDP have a gr eater ratio of overweight to under weight women . 89North Africa and the Middle East ar e two ar eas of the world with middle- and low-income coun - tries that are experiencing very high rates of overweight and obesity, often higher in women than in men.82 The rise of over weight and obesity since the mid-1970s has been much faster in lower-income countries.63In Europe and the US A, the prevalence has risen relatively slowly, by 0.3-0.5 per cent each year ; but the figur es are two- to four - fold higher in many low-income countries.90Projections from existing data suggest that by 2015, levels of obesity couldbe as high as 50 per cent in the US A, between 30 and 40 per cent in the UK and Australia, and more than 20 per cent in Brazil. 46See figure 1.4. It is estimated that more than 12 million adults in England will be obese by 2010, while 25 per cent of children who live in households with obese par- ents will become obese themselves.88 1.2.3 Physical activity Changes in degrees of physical activity throughout the world have also been rapid since the 1970s, as paid and household In 2004 India had a population of over 1.1 billion, growing at a rate of about 1.2 per cent a year; it was the next country afterChina to reach the 1-billion mark.46India has a low-income economy, with a grossdomestic product of 1830 internationaldollars per person (figure 1.3). Life expectancy at birth is 61 years for men and 63 for women (figure 1.1). 46India Projected increases in obesity Figure 1.4 2002 men 2015 men 2002 women 2015 womenEgypt South Africa China India Japan UK Spain Poland USA Brazil Mexico Australia010203040506070Projections based on adults aged 30 -100 Data from World Health Organization46Per cent of adults with BMI 30 Projected incr eases in obesity (BMI of above 30 kg/m2) in selected countries, 2002-2015 Age-standardised rates of common cancers India Age-standardised rate per 100 000 Data from International Agency for Research on Cancer20LungOral Pharynx Oesophagus0102030 5152535 Cervix OralBreast OesophagusMen Women Non-communicable causes of death India Data from World Health Organization46Cardiovascular disease Cancer Respiratory disease Diabetes OtherPer cent of deaths 5712 1531315CHAPTER 1 INTERNATIONAL VARIATIONS AND TRENDS work has become incr easingly mechanised, and vehicles ar e used more often for transport. Occupational and household physical activity has r educed dramatically in high-income countries. Also see Chapters 5, 6 and 8. There is as yet no globally accepted, quantified definition of physical inactivity , or of the extent to which populations or people should be physically active. In 2002, the WHO recommended a minimum of 30 minutes moderate-intensi-ty physical activity most days; it found that at least 60 percent of the world's population fails to achieve this level ofphysical activity . 91 The pr oportion of people employed in agricultur e can reflect the level of work-r elated activity undertaken in a country, and there may be a linear relationship between the two.91Thus, it is likely that, compared with high-income countries, transport-r elated and occupational and household physical activity is higher in low-income countries. Transport-r elated physical activity (cycling, walking) is high- er in those countries with the lowest gr oss domestic pr od- uct and low car ownership, and this differs little between men and women. Data on physical activity in Africa ar e limited. Several stud - ies are available for South Africa, but these cannot be used to predict or generalise about activity levels across the entirecontinent. Some small regional studies have been performed, in Ethiopia, for example, which provide useful local infor- mation , but they are not nationally representative. Data fr om Eur ope, wher e recreational physical activity accounts for a greater proportion of total activity, suggest that approximately half of all walking and cycling trips areless than 3 km. Ther efore, almost half of Eur opean adults donot do enough physical activity getting fr om one place to another. 91In Europe, people living in more northerly regions such as Scandinavia have higher levels of activity than those living further south, for example, in Mediterranean coun- tries. Women tend to exercise less than men and this differ-ence is gr eatest in southern Eur opean countries. 42 A study conducted in 1953 demonstrated that more than half of US school children failed a minimum standard of Chronic diseases account for 58.1 per cent of all deaths, while infectious diseases,maternal, perinatal, and nutritional condi- tions account for 32.9 per cent; 9 per cent of deaths are due to injuries. 46The first fig- ure gives a breakdown of deaths caused by chronic disease.46 Common cancers in men include those of the oral cavity and pharynx.20Although these cancers have declined since the late 1970s, the incidence remains high.20Cancers of the oesophagus and lung have also decreased slightly in the same period.20In women, cancer of the cervix is the most com-mon type, and has been since the 1970s; breast cancer has increased steadily during this time. 20Cancers of the oral cavity and oesophagus have declined slightly since the late 1970s (for age-standardised rates of these cancers, see the second figure).20 For the period 2002-2003, 10 per cent of men and 16 per cent of women aged 18-69 were classified as sedentary (figure 1.6).46 In 2000 men aged 20-24 had an average body mass index (BMI) of 20.7, while thoseaged 40-54 had an average BMI of 23.6.46 For men aged 20-70, 25.4 per cent had a BMI of over 25.46Women aged 20-24 had an average BMI of 20.9, rising to an aver- age of 24 at age 30; and women aged 30-69 also had a BMI of around 24.46In total, 35.8 per cent of women aged 20-70 had a BMI of over 25.46A review from 2002 established that the prevalence ofpreschool obesity was about 1 per cent, but stunting remained a problem in over half of all children. 39Obesity has been uncom- mon in India and varies with socioeconomic status, being more common in high-income households. In the 1970s, 2.1 per cent ofmen and 2.9 per cent of women had a BMI of 25 or more, while less than 0.5 per cent of men and women had a BMI of 30 ormore. 46By 1998 these figures had risen: 4.4 per cent of men and 4.3 per cent of womenhad a BMI of 25 or more. 46See figure 1.4 for projections of the proportions of menand women who will have a BMI of 30 ormore in 2015. 46 The average amount of available foodenergy rose between 1964 and 2004, from around 2050 to 2470 kcal/person per day(8580 to 10 360 kJ/person per day). 1 Recently, though, there have been large increases in the consumption of animalproducts, fats, and sugars. The proportion of energy from fat has increased each year, although within India there are differences:for higher-income groups, 32 per cent of energy comes from fat, compared with 17 per cent in lower-income groups. 39 Since 1975 there has been a reduction in cereal (grains) consumption, particularly coarse grains, although this has not affect-ed overall energy consumption. This is probably due to large increases in intakes of fats and animal protein, and also of milkand milk products. In lower-income house- holds, fat comes mainly from vegetable foods, with very little consumption of ani- mal fats, whereas in the highest-incomehouseholds, the majority of fat is fr om ani - mal sources. India is a major producer of vegetables and fruits, much of which areexported.

Similartrends exist for men and women and for socioeconomic sta- tus in A ustralia. 42 A number of factors will affect levels of physical activity in future. Economic development has the effect of reducing lev- els of occupational, household, and transport physical activ-ity. It reduces the amount of physical activity in the workplace, often because of a shift from agriculture to man- ufacturing and ser vice industries. Impr oved public transport in middle- and low-income countries r educes transport- related activity. Similarly, as people gain more disposable income, they are more likely to own a car, which means thatthey will mak e fewer journeys by bicycle or foot. R ecreational activity is the only area in which physical activity may increase as economies develop and countries become increas-ingly urbanised and mechanised, although people may not necessarily use their leisure time for active pursuits. 91 Other factors constrain physical activity in cities, such as personal safety : crime rates ar e often high and it may be unsafe to walk, jog, or cycle in the streets. Furthermore, city and town planning may not encourage people to be active\u2014 for example, people can only walk, run , ride, and play ifthere are sidewalks/pavements, parks, or other areas where they can move ar ound fr eely and safely . Cultural and r eli- gious customs may also limit activity levels, particularly for women. By 2020 it is pr edicted that mor e adults will be physically In 2004 Japan's population was just over 128 million, with 79 per cent living in urban areas.46The country has a high-income economy, with a gross domestic product of30 039 international dollars per person (fig- ure 1.3). Life expectancy at birth is 79 years for men and 86 for women (figure 1.1).46 Chronic diseases account for 78.7 percent of all deaths, while infectious diseases, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional condi- tions account for 10.5 per cent; 10.8 per cent of deaths are due to injuries. The firstJapan Sedentary behaviour is defined as less than 30 minutes of moderate physical activity (equivalent to brisk walking) on fewerthan 5 days/week, or less than 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity (equivalent to r unning) on fewer than 3 days/week.

In Europe, for example, the former Soviet Union states and countries ineastern Eur ope ar e at the lower end of the estimates, with western European countries at the higher end. Indeed, these figures are expected to rise further in western Europe and itis estimated that 50-60 per cent of adults will not be suffi-ciently physically active by 2020. Also see figure 1.5. The per-centage of adults curr ently classified as sedentary in selected national examples is shown in figur e 1.6. Using differ ent def- initions, the amount of adults (aged over 16 years) classi - fied as sedentary for the UK are 60 per cent of men and 66 per cent of women. For the USA 52 per cent of men and 65per cent of women (aged over 18 years) ar e classified as sedentary. 46 1.2.4 Cancer Patterns of cancer and trends, incidence, and projections vary greatly in different parts of the world. Also see Chapter 7. In 2002 ther e wer e mor e than 10 million new cases of can - cer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) recorded world- wide, and nearly 7 million cancer deaths. By 2020 thesefigures are estimated to rise to over 16 million new cases, with 10 million deaths. There may be more than 20 million new cases of cancer in 2030. 93Indications suggest that, at that time, 70 per cent of cancer deaths will be in low-income countries. This projected increase is accounted for by a combination of factors: the pr ojected incr treatment, which increases the number of people living with a diagnosis of cancer (see Chapter 9); the projected increas-es in tobacco smoking in many countries; and the incr ease in the number of people with HIV/AIDS in some countries. The global age-adjusted incidence of cancer is also likely toincrease. Also see box 1.2. Globally, the most commonly diagnosed cancers (exclud- ing all types of skin cancer) ar e those of the lung, colon and rectum, and br east, with lung cancer being the leading cause of cancer death. 94 95Geographical and socioeconomic dif - ferences exist for the most common cancers. In low-income countries, the most prevalent cancers include those of whichinfectious agents ar e a major cause, while in high-income countries, they include hormone-related cancers. In high- income countries, and among men , prostate cancer is the most common type, followed by cancers of the lung, stom - ach, and colon and rectum. In low-income countries, and among men, lung cancer is the most common type, followedby cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, and liver . Breast can - cer is the most common type among women living in high- income countries, followed by cancers of the lung, colon andrectum, and endometrium. Breast cancer is also the most fre- quent type among women living in low-income countries, followed by cancers of the lung, stomach, and cer vix. 94 96 1.2.4.1 Oesophagus Oesophageal cancer is the seventh most common type of cancer worldwide, with mor e than 46 0000 new cases record- figure gives a breakdown of deaths caused by chronic diseases.46 In men, cancer of the stomach is the most common type of cancer. This is followed bycolorectal, lung, liver, and prostate cancers,which have increased since the 1960s. Cancer of the oesophagus has remained steady since the 1960s, although the inci-dence of cancer of the pancreas has increased since then. 20In women, breast cancer is the most common type and its inci- dence has risen since the 1970s.20Colorectal cancer is the next most common type, andthis has also increased. Stomach cancer inci- dence has decreased since the 1960s, but the rate remains high; lung cancer has risen steadily since the 1960s. 20The incidence of cancer of the cervix increased during the1960s and remained high in the 1970s, but has since declined (for age-standardisedrates of these cancers, see the second fig - ure). 20However , the total numbers of new cancer cases and cancer deaths are set to rise because Japan has an ageing popula-tion. Cancer has been the leading cause ofdeath in Japan since 1981 and projectionsindicate that in 2015 almost 900 000 people will develop cancer and 450 000 will die from cancer. 47 Regional studies suggest that 68-70 per cent of men and 70-82 per cent of women,aged 20-70, are physically inactive. In men there has been a steady increase in body mass index (BMI) since the mid-1970s. In 2002, 17.5 per cent of men aged 20-29 and around 30 per cent of those aged 30-60 had a BMI of over 25. Only 7 per cent of women aged 20-29, 19 per cent of those aged 40-49, and 25.6 per cent ofthose aged 50-59 had a BMI of over 25. See figure 1.4 for projections of the proportions of men and women who will have a BMI of 30 or more in 2015. The average amount of available food energy rose between 1964 and 2004, from around 2570 to 2760 kcal/person per day(10 780 to 11 540 kJ/person per day). Meat consumption also incr eased during this time. 1Steamed rice was the staple food until 1950, and accounted for 80 per cent ofener gy intake befor e 1935. Dietar y intake of cereals (grains), almost all rice, hasdecreased, from 75 per cent of energy in the 1940s to 41.3 per cent in 2000. Energy from fat increased from 6.9 per cent in 1949 to 25 per cent in 1988, and to 26.5 per centin 2002. Total fat intake has increased sig-nificantly following the country's econom- ic growth, from 15 g/person per day in the 1940s to 59 g in 1983, remaining at aroundthis level in 2002. The percentage of ener- gy in diets from protein has risen from 12.4 per cent in the 1940s to 15.9 per cent in 2000. However, there has been a larger increase in the percentage of protein fromanimal sources: from 18.6 per cent in the 1940s to more than 50 per cent in 2000. In 2002, people were continuing to eat more green and yellow vegetables, with people over 50 tending to eat the most vegetables.Fruit intake peaked in 1975 and has since decreased and stabilised. In 2002, Japanesediets did not pr ovide the recommended intake of calcium: although consumption ofmilk and dairy products had increased, con-sumption of fish and shellfish had declinedslightly . Salt intake r emained high, at over 12 g/person per day. 2318PART I BACKGROUND ed in 2002. Because it has a poor survival rate, it is the fifth most common cause of cancer death, r esponsible for nearly 390000 deaths in 2002. Incidence rates var y widely between countries. Studies suggest that cancer of the oesophagus is 100 times more common in parts of China than in Europe and North America.94 97Other ar eas of high risk include southern and eastern Africa, south-central Asia, and some countriesin South America. Geographical variability of exposure to established car- In 2001 the UK population was nearly 60 million.30The UK is a high-income economy, with a gross domestic product of 31300international dollars per person (figure 1.3). Life expectancy at birth is 76 years for men and 81 for women (figure 1.1). Chronic diseases account for 84 per cent of all deaths, while infectious diseases,maternal, perinatal, and nutritional condi- tions account for 11 per cent; 4.9 per centof deaths are due to injuries. The first fig- ure below gives a breakdown of deaths caused by chronic diseases. 46 Prostate cancer is the most common can- cer type in men and has increased steadily since the 1970s.20Lung cancer incidence peaked in the 1960s, remained high until the mid-1980s, and is now declining.20 Colorectal cancer has risen steadily since 1960.20Bladder cancer, which had been ris-ing steadily since the 1960s, is now decreas- ing, and stomach cancer incidence has declined since the 1960s.20In women, breast cancer is the most common type, and although rates were fairly constant during the 1960s and 1970s, they have risen steadi- ly since then.20The incidence of colorectal cancer has remained steady since the1960s. 20Lung cancer rose from the 1960s to 1980s, and has remained steady sinceUK After cancer registers were established in various countries in the second half of the20th century, descriptive studies showedreliably for the first time that rates andtrends of dif ferent cancers var y, sometimes substantially acr oss dif ferent countries. This variation suggested that cancer is not just genetically inherited and that different cancers have different causes. Many countries publish annual incidence and mor tality rates for cancer . The inci- dence rate refers to the number of new cancer cases reported; the mortality rate refers to the number of deaths fr om can -cer. These rates are usually expressed as the number of new cases (or deaths) each yearfor every 100000 people. Cancers are not usually diagnosed until they pr oduce symptoms, so ther e is a peri - od of time between the first stages of can - cer development and its identification. This length of time can vary greatly, and there are also considerable differences in survivaltimes and how types of cancer respond to treatment. Many countries and international agen- cies track mortality statistics with causes of death, and national or r egional cancerregistries prepare cancer-incidence statis- tics. W ith types of cancer wher e sur vival is high, cancer mortality statistics will not reflect occurrence rates. But globally, it is easier to obtain statistics for mor tality than for incidence, so these ar e often used for comparisons between population groups. It can also be difficult to compare can- cer incidence globally: not all countries and regions ar e covered by cancer registries, and these organisations may use different definitions and collect different data, both geographically and over time.

In high- income countries, alcohol and smoking tobacco ar e the main carcinogenic agents, wher eas chewing tobacco is more com- mon in India. P ockets of high incidence occurring in parts of China and in the Caspian littoral of Iran may be due to general nutritional deficiencies. Incidence of adenocarcino-ma of the lower thir d of the oesophagus is steadily increas- ing in the USA and Europe, which is likely to be linked to an incr easing incidence of acid r eflux from the stomach due to obesity . 94 95Also see chapter 7.3. 1.2.4.2 Lung Lung (pulmonar y) cancer has been the most common type of cancer in the world since 1985, with around 1.35 million new cases recorded in 2002. It is also the most commoncause of cancer death. In 2002, 1.2 million people died from lung cancer. Between 1985 and 2002, the estimated number of lung cancer cases worldwide r ose by 51 per cent, and the num - ber of cases in middle- and low-income countries has increased steadily over recent years. Previous estimates indi-cated that the majority of lung cancer cases occurr ed in high-income countries (almost 70 per cent in 1980); almost half wer e predicted to occur in middle- and low-income countries in 2005. 94 95The US A and Eur ope have the high- est numbers of lung cancer cases for both men and women , but the incidence appears to have peaked, and may now be declining in the USA and in parts of northern Europe. Itis, however , still increasing in southern and eastern Europe. Men are more likely to develop lung cancer than women, almost certainly because, on average, they smok e mor e than women . Worldwide, 1 billion men and 250 million women currently smoke tobacco. It is estimated that throughout the 20th century, 100 million people died from tobacco use. 93 Also see chapter 7.4. 1.2.4.3 Stomach Stomach (gastric) cancer is now the fourth most common type of cancer worldwide, with around 925000 new cases recorded in 2002. It is the second most common cause of death fr om cancer , with ar ound 70 0000 deaths annually . Until about the mid-1980s, stomach cancer was the most common type in the world. Since then, rates have fallen sub-stantially in all high-income countries, and overall rates ar e then.20Cancer of the ovary has increased slightly since the 1960s, and rates of cancer of the endometrium have remained thesame since the 1960s (for age-standardised rates of these cancers, see the second fig- ure). 20The incidence of childhood cancer has been rising at an average rate of 1.1 per cent each year and, between 1978 and 1997, the age-standardised incidenceincreased from 120 to 141 cases/million chil- dren. 22Children in the British Isles have the highest rates of skin cancer in Europe.11 In 2003, 64 per cent of men and 76 per cent of women aged 16-69 were classifiedas sedentary. 46A study to examine exercise patterns in adults in 1991 and again in 1999 found that only 4 in 10 adults had man- aged to meet and maintain the current rec-ommended level of activity, or to increase their level. During the study period, themajority either reduced their activity level or maintained it below the r ecommended level, and 15 per cent of the sample wasinactive, both in 1991 and 1999. 33 In the UK, body mass index (BMI) has risen steadily since the mid-1970s. For the proportions of men and women in 1980 and in 2003 with a BMI of between 25 and29.9, or of over 30, see the figure on this page. Also see figure 1.4 for projections of the pr oportions of men and women who will have a BMI of 30 or mor e in 2015. The average amount of available food energy rose between 1964 and 2004,from around 3280 to 3480 kcal/person per day (13 730 570 kJ/person per day). 1Consump- tion of pasta, rice,cereals (grains), yogurt, soft drinks, savoury snacks, andnuts has increased since the mid-1980s. Over the same peri-od, intakes of fish and fish dishes and eggs and egg dishes have decreased. 19 Large studies sug- gest that fat intake has decreased be- cause people now consume less wholemilk, butter , and r ed meat, and more veg- etables and fruits. 35Men surveyed between 2000 and 2001 were more likely to eat foods containing fats, oils, and sugars, aswell as meat and meat pr oducts, and soft and alcoholic drinks. In the same survey, and compared with older men and all women, young men were more likely to eat savoury snacks and soft drinks, and less likely to eat eggs, fish, andfruit. 19Women ate mor e fruit, although only 13 per cent of men and 15 per cent of women ate the recommended five dailyportions of vegetables and fruits. Instead, men ate an average of 2.7 por tions while women had 2.9.19The survey also showed that vegetable and fruit consumption wasparticularly low in young adults, and that people from low-income households were less likely to eat fruit and yogurt. 19It appears that more-educated adults putdietar y guidelines into practice, reducing the amount of fat in their diets and increas- ing the amount of vegetables and fr uits they eat. 3 Increases in BMI UK Data from Department of Health48 and Rosenbaum et al49Non-communicable causes of death UK Data from World Health Organization46Cardiovascular disease Cancer Respiratory disease Diabetes OtherPer cent of deaths 42 8 33116 Per cent adults with BMI 25-29.9 1980 (UK)2003 (England)02040 103050 1980 (UK)2003 (England) Women MenAge-standardised rates of common cancers UK Age-standardised rate per 100 000 Data from International Agency for Research on Cancer20LungProstate BladderColorectum OvaryBreast EndometriumMen Women 0102030405090 cent adults with BMI 3020PART I BACKGROUND now about 15 per cent lower than in 1985.94-96 Stomach cancer is now much more common in Asia than in the US A or Eur ope. Indeed, 42 per cent of cases occur in China alone.94 97High-risk areas are China, Japan, eastern Europe, and Central and South America. Low-risk areas areSouth-East Asia, northern and eastern Africa, the USA, andAustralia and New Zealand. In most countries, incidence hasdropped by about 15 per cent compared with 1985. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori is an established cause of stomach cancer . Reduction in stomach cancer rates can be explained partly by reduced exposure to H pylori and part- ly by increased use of refrigeration to preserve foods.94 97Also see chapter 7.5. 1.2.4.4 Liver Liver (hepatic) cancer is the sixth most common type of can - cer worldwide, with around 625000 new cases recorded in 2002. The poor prognosis makes it the third most commoncause of cancer death, with ar ound 60 0000 deaths in 2002. In most countries, the incidence of liver cancer is stable and there is little difference in survival rates between high-and low-income countries. More than 80 per cent of cases occur in middle- and low-income countries. Areas with a high incidence ar e China (55 per cent of all new cases), sub- Saharan Africa, and eastern and south-eastern Asia.Incidence is lower in high-income countries and in Latin America, although Japan and areas of southern Europe haveintermediate incidence levels. 94 96Exposures to the hepatitis B and C viruses are known to increase the risk of developing liver cancer; 85 per cent ofcases in low-income countries ar e attributed to exposur es to these two viruses. Also see chapter 7.8. 1.2.4.5 Colon and rectum Colorectal cancer (of the colon or rectum) is the third most common type of cancer worldwide, with just over 1 millionnew cases r ecorded in 2002. Mortality is approximately half that of the incidence, and nearly 53 0000 deaths were recorded in 2002, making it the fourth most common cause of death from cancer. There is a large geographical difference in the global dis- tribution of colorectal cancers. Incidence varies up to 25-fold between countries with the highest rates (the US A, Australia and New Zealand, and in parts of Eur ope) and those with the lowest rates (in Africa and Asia). Intermediate levels occur in South America. Incidence of color ectal cancer may be stabilising in parts of northern and western Europe, and possibly declining gradually in the USA. Elsewhere, however, the incidence isincreasing rapidly, particularly in Japan and in middle- and low-income countries. 94 96 As shown in 1.3, the incidence of color ectal cancer increas- es quickly when people migrate fr om low- to high-risk ar eas of the world. Indeed, the incidence rate is higher in Japanese people born in the USA than in white people born in theUSA. Also see chapter 7.9. In 2004 Poland had a population of around 38.5 million. The country has an upper-mid- dle-income economy, with a gross domesticproduct of 12647 international dollars per person (figure 1.3). 46Life expectancy atbirth is 71 years for men and 79 for women (figure 1.1).46 Chronic diseases account for 88.2 per cent of all deaths, while infectious diseases, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional condi-tions account for 3.9 per cent; 7.9 per cent of deaths are due to injuries.

Incidence rates are increasing in most countries, with an estimated 1.15 mil- lion new cases recorded in 2002. Breast cancer is the sixthmost common cause of death from cancer overall. However,it is the second most common cause of cancer death inwomen , with just over 410000 deaths recorded in 2002. The incidence of br east cancer is highest in high-income countries (although not in Japan) and mor e than half of all cases occur in these countries. Although breast cancer has been less common in women living in low-income countries,age-adjusted incidence is incr easing, and the rates of increase are often greater in these countries. Globally , estimates indicate that br east cancer incidence has incr eased by 0.5 per cent annually since 1990. However , certain cancer registries, such as those in China and other parts of Asia, are recording annual increases in incidence ofup to 4 per cent. Rates ar e low in Africa, with the lowest inci - dence in central Africa. 94 96 Migrant studies show that breast cancer rates change when women move to a new country. See 1.3. Also see chapter 7.10. 1.2.4.7 Cer vix Cancer of the cervix is the second most common type of can- cer among women, and the eighth most common canceroverall, with ar ound 50 0000 new cases recorded in 2002.Cervical cancer is the seventh most common cause of death from cancer overall, and the third most common in women,and was r esponsible for nearly 27 5000 deaths in 2002. Over 80 per cent of cases occur in low-income countries. Areas with the highest incidence rates are sub-Saharan Africa,the Caribbean, Central and South America, and south-cen-tral and South-East Asia. Incidence rates are lowest in Europe,the US A, Japan, China, and Australia and New Zealand. The incidence has dr opped substantially in high-income countries following the intr oduction of cer vical screening programmes. The major established cause of cervical cancer is infection with certain subtypes of human papilloma viruses (HPV). Other cofactors (parity , contraception, HIV infection, and smoking) can also modify the risk of this cancer in women infected with HPV . 94 96 97Also see chapter 7.13. 1.2.4.8 Prostate Prostate cancer is the thir d most common type of cancer in men, and the sixth most common cancer overall, with near- ly 680 000 new cases recorded in 2002. The majority of casesare diagnosed in men over the age of 65, and this cancer accounted for just over 220000 cancer deaths in 2002. This made it the eighth most common cause of death fr om can- cer overall, and the sixth most common in men . Prostate cancer is more common in high-income countries, but the incidence remains low in Japan. Incidence rates havebeen influenced by scr eening pr ogrammes, which incr ease cancer in men and age-adjusted incidence has remained stable since the 1970s.20The incidence of colorectal cancer has increasedsince 1990, and both prostate and bladder cancers have increased slightly since the 1970s. 20Stomach cancer incidence peaked in the late 1970s and has declined steadily since. Breast and colorectal cancers are the most common types in women and their rateshave risen steadily since the 1970s. 20Cancer of the cervix has remained steady since the mid-1970s, whereas cancers of the lung,ovary, and endometrium have increased in this period (for age-standardised rates of these cancers, see the second figure). 20 In 1996, 31 per cent of men and 32 per cent of women aged 15-75 were classified as sedentary.46 In 1996 men aged 15-29 had an average body mass index (BMI) of 23.1.46This rose to 25.9 for men aged 30-44, while those aged 45-75 had a BMI of between 26 and 27.46 Only 2.4 per cent of men aged 15-29 had a BMI of over 30, rising to 10.8 per cent of those aged 30-44, and 17.5 per cent of 45-59year olds. 46In the same year , women aged 15-29 had an average BMI of 21.2.46Womenaged 30-44 had a BMI of 24.1, while those aged 45-59 had a BMI of 26.7.46Only 1.5 per cent of women aged 15-29 had a BMI ofover 30, rising to 22.5 per cent of those aged 45-59, and 23.7 per cent of women aged 60-74. 46In a study of adults in Warsaw, the average adult BMI remained stable between 1983 and 1993 at approximately 27.46Overall in 1996, 10.3 per cent of men and 12.4 percent of women had a BMI of 30 or more. 46 See figure 1.4 for projections of the propor- tions of men and women who will have aBMI of 30 or more in 2015. 46 The average amount of available food energy rose between 1964 and 2004, from around 3310 to 3520 kcal/person per day (13850 to 14 730 kJ/person per day). The amount of energy available from sugars and meat increased during this period, while the ener gy available from animal fats fell substantially.1In 1989 Poland began the transition fr om a centrally planned to a market economy. This resulted in dramaticincreases in food prices, and although the transition gave people a better choice offoods, ther e was a decline in food demand and alterations in dietary patterns. 37Tobacco smoking and alcoholic drink con- sumption are underlying factors in overall mortality trends in eastern Europe. Ananalysis of national household budget and individual dietary surveys carried out in the 1990s found that, each day, the averageperson ate around 300 g of dairy products and the same amount of cereals (grains) and roots and tubers, although consump-tion of pulses (legumes) was very low. 38A study of students found that women ate meat and drank beer less frequently thanmen, and they ate more fruit and drank more milk. 8Another local study, in Warsaw, reported decreases in intakes of total ener- gy, dietary cholesterol, and dietary animal fats, and an increase in vegetable oil intake between 1984 and 2001.45Another study found that between 1990 and 2000, the proportion of men eating fruit each day increased from 36 to 42 per cent. Levels of intake wer e stable in women, with ar ound 60 per cent eating fruit every day. In con-trast, over the same decade, only 22-23 per cent of men limited their fat intake,although mor e women did during this peri - od (an increase from 23 to 45 per cent). 4022PART I BACKGROUND diagnosis rates. This has r esulted in a huge incr ease in the number of recorded cases in the USA in recent years, although the incidence in several high-income countries hasdeclined since the 1990s. Pr ostate cancer incidence is increasing rapidly in low-income countries, particularly in Latin American countries (such as Costa Rica, Colombia,and Ecuador) and in China. Again, this may partly be dueto increased awareness and screening. Mortality fr om prostate cancer is lower (5.8 per cent of cancer deaths in men), 94and may give a better indication of actual disease patterns.97Even so , mortality is appr ox- imately 10 times more common in the USA and Europe than in Asia. Also see chapter 7.14. 1.3 Migrant and other ecological studies Ecological studies (also called correlation studies) exam- ine the relationships between environmental factors anddisease outcomes, often in differ ent countries, at an aggr e- gate level (see chapter 3.1.2). These provided the first sys- tematically gathered evidence suggesting that the principalcauses of cancer are environmental, and that food, nutri- tion, and physical activity are among these factors. Early studies showed str ong correlations among countries between , for instance, dietar y fat intak e and br east can - cer rates. 98 While not providing strong evidence for causation, such studies generated hypotheses for possible links betweenspecific nutritional factors and cancers at particular sites, and for the general proposition that patterns of cancer might be altered as a result of changing patterns of eating andother ways of life. P art 2 of this R eport explor es the degree In 2004 Spain had a population of over 43 million. The country has a high-incomeeconomy, with a gross domestic product of 24 325 international dollars per person (fig-ure 1.3). 46Life expectancy at birth is 77 years for men and 83 for women (figure 1.1).46 Chronic diseases account for 87.4 per cent of all deaths, while infectious diseases,maternal, perinatal, and nutritional condi- tions account for 5.5 per cent; 6.9 per centof deaths are due to injuries.

The most compelling evidence, suggesting that the main causes of cancers of most sites ar e envir onmental (due to fac - tors that people are exposed to) rather than genetically inherited comes from studies of migrant populations. There are many migrant populations. Examples includepeople who have migrated from eastern Asia to the Americas; from the Indian subcontinent to Africa and the UK; from Europe to Australia; and from Africa to the Caribbean , and then to the UK. All of these population move- ments ar e accompanied by mark ed changes in patterns of diet, physical activity, and disease. Migrations from Japan to the USA, from the Caribbean to the UK, and fr om Eur opean countries to A ustralia have been to chronic diseases.46 Lung cancer is the most common cancer type in men and incidence rates haveincreased dramatically since the 1970s. 20 Rates of colorectal, prostate, bladder, and oral cancers have risen since records beganin the 1970s. 20Breast cancer is the most common type in women and the rate has doubled since the 1970s.20Colorectal cancer is the next most common type, which has seen a steady rise during this period.20 Cancers of the endometrium and cervix have remained steady since the 1970s, but cancer of the ovary has risen (for age-stan-dardised rates of these cancers, see the sec- ond figure). 20 A survey in 1997 found that 76 per cent of adults aged 16 and over did no regularexercise during their leisure time 29; 46 per cent of adults wer e classified as sedentar y, with only 7 per cent of adults recording any physical activity each week.29 Between 1994 and 1997, men aged 25-34 had an average body mass index (BMI) of 25, while those aged 35-44 had aBMI of 26, and 45-75 year olds had a BMI of 27.46In total, 35 per cent of men aged 25-64 had a BMI of over 27, and 12.2 percent had a BMI of over 30. 46Women aged 25-34 had an average BMI of 23, while those aged 35-44 had a BMI of 25, and45-74 year olds had a BMI of between 27 and 28. 46Overall, 25.7 per cent of women aged 25-64 had a BMI of over 27, and 12.1per cent had a BMI of over 30. 46 Over the period 1977-1993, the propor- tion of people with energy-intensive jobshalved. In children aged 6-7, there has been a marked increase in obesity and over- weight, higher even than in US children of the same age. Obesity in adolescents is also among the highest in the world. 29Between 1990 and 2000, 45 per cent of men and 32.2 per cent of women had a BMI of 25 or more, and 13.4 per cent of men and 15.8 per cent of women had a BMI of 30 or more. See figur e 1.4 for projections of the proportions of men and women who willhave a BMI of 30 or more in 2015. 46 The average amount of available foodenergy rose between 1964 and 2004, from around 2700 to 3480 kcal/person per day (11 330 to 14 590 kJ/person per day), duelargely to an increase in the availability of sugars and meat. 1The Mediterranean-style diet is often seen as the healthiest inEurope, but Spanish diets have recently shifted towards being high in fat and dairy products, with only moderate amounts ofvegetables. Dairy and fruit intakes are the highest in Europe, but so is the proportion of energy in diets from fat. 29Between 1964 and 1990, consumption of plant-based foods decreased from 1289 to 995 g/person per day. In the same period, intakes of cere- als (grains), pulses (legumes), and potatoes all halved. While consumption of other veg- etables remained stable, fruit intake dou- bled to 327 g/person per day. Consumption of animal pr oducts increased from 407 to 743 g/person per day due to a large increase in the amounts of meat, poultr y, milk, and dairy products in people's diets, although intakes of animal fats decreased. 29 Age-standardised incidence of breast and colorectal cancer is increased in Asian migrants to Canada compared with source population Figure 1.9 Incidence of colorectal cancer in Asian migrants to USA and their descendants Data from Flood et al106Men Women White USA 89.9 64.3Chinese USA 66.9 40.9 China 87.8 44.7 Japanese USA 142.5 90.1 Japan 69.3 63.5 Filipino USA 57.2 14.2 Philippines 44.4 25.7Ethnicity Birth place Incidence rate per 100 000 people Age-standardised incidence of colorectal cancer is increased in the descendants of Japanese migrants to the USA Figure 1.8 Cancer among female Iranian migrants to British Columbia, Canada Data from Yavari et al104Age-standardised incidence in women per 100 000 Cancer Ardabil Kerman Iranian British province province migrants to Columbia (Iran) (Iran) British general Columbia Breast 7.6 16.9 68.5 81.4 Colorectal Not done 5.9 11.6 26.624PART I BACKGROUND studied in some detail, as have movements of populations from rural to urban areas within countries. Both types ofmigration r esult in dietary changes, which are followed, within one or two generations, by changes in disease pat- terns. P atterns of cancer among migrant gr oups often change faster than they do among people who r emain in their home country or among people native to the host country. In the 1980s, one study demonstrated that breast cancer incidence incr eased almost thr eefold in first-generation Japanese women who migrated to Hawaii, and up to five- fold in the second generation. Colorectal cancer incidenceincreased almost fourfold in the first generation but did not increase further with subsequent generations. 99In this same population , the incidence of stomach cancer dropped by almost half in the first generation , and dr opped further in the second generation.99 Another study, published in 1980, of European migrants to Australia demonstrated a r eduction in the death rate fr omstomach cancer, which corresponded to the length of time the migrants stayed in Australia. However, their risk of col-orectal cancer increased proportionally to the length of their stay. 100See figure 1.7. A later study demonstrated that deaths fr om br east cancer among Italian migrants to Australia wer e half that of A ustralian-born women during the first five years after emigrating. However, after 17 years, Italian migrants had similar death rates (due to breast can-cer) to women born in A ustralia. 101 Following migration, the incidence of certain cancers may increase, whereas the incidence of other cancers maydecrease. Thus among Iranian immigrants to Canada, in women, breast cancer incidence rate increased fourfold, and color ectal cancer incidence rate doubled; but there was a dramatic decr ease in cancers of the stomach and oesopha - gus in both sexes. 102See figure 1.8. Another study showed that breast cancer incidence increased thr eefold within one generation in P olish migrants In 2004 the USA had a population of almost 300 million. The country has a high-income economy, with a gross domestic product of39 901 international dollars per person (fig- ure 1.3), which masks socioeconomic inequalities. 46Life expectancy at birth is 75 years for men and 80 for women (figure 1.1).46 Chronic diseases account for 84.7 per cent of all deaths, while infectious diseases, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional condi-tions account for 6.7 per cent; 8.6 per cent of deaths are due to injuries. The first fig- ure below gives a breakdown of deathscaused by chronic diseases. 46Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men and the incidence rate has more than doubled since the 1970s.20Lung cancer peaked in the early 1980s and has since declined slightly.20Rates of colorectal and bladder cancer have remained stable, although melanoma has increased steadi- ly.20Breast cancer is the most common type in women, followed by lung cancer, and both have increased since the 1970s.20Over the same period, the incidence of cancers ofthe colon and rectum and of the ovary have remained stable, while cancer of the endometrium has decreased slightly (forage-standardised rates of these cancers, seethe second figure below). 20 In 2003, 22 per cent of men and 27 per cent of women aged 20-65 were classi-fied as sedentary; physical inactivity was more prevalent among people with a low income. 91 In 2002 men aged 20-24 had an average body mass index (BMI) of 26.2, while those aged 25-29 had a BMI of 27, and men aged30-65 had a BMI of between 27 and 29. 46 While 19.7 per cent of men aged 20-24 had a BMI of over 30, this rose to 23.6 per centof those aged 30-34, and 30 per cent of 40-44 year olds. 46Women aged 20-24 had an average BMI of 26.2, while those agedUSA Increases in BMI USA Data from World Health Organization46 Non-communicable causes of death USA Data from World Health Organization46Cardiovascular disease Cancer Respiratory disease Diabetes OtherPer cent of deaths 41 298418 Age-standardised rates of common cancers USA Age-standardised rate per 100 000 Data from International Agency for Research on Cancer20Lung ColorectumProstate Bladder Melanoma AND TRENDS to the USA.103Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino people who migrate to the USA have a higher risk of colorectal cancerthan their counterparts who do not migrate. One study of US-born Japanese men demonstrated incidence rates of col- orectal cancer twice as high as Japanese men born in coun - tries other than the US A or Japan and 60 per cent higher than in white people born in the USA (figure 1.9). 104 Data from more recent migrant studies show that cancer incidence rates generally become similar to those of the adopted country in second-generation immigrants.17 105This is illustrated in first-generation immigrants to Sweden,where the incidence of all cancers was 5 and 8 per cent lower for men and women, respectively, compared with native Swedes. 17By the second generation , however, the incidence was only mar ginally below the figur es for people native to Sweden.105 Correlation studies, and migrant studies in particular, prove that the main determinants of patterns of cancer ar eenvironmental and suggest that patterns of food, nutrition, and physical activity are important among these causes.Migrants shar e a common genetic background, as do their parents and children: the genetic pool of any population does not change within a generation or two . But as shown in Chapter 2, differ ent patterns of envir onmental exposur e can and do alter patterns of DNA damage and gene expression, and so cancer, in a relatively short time. 1.4 Conclusions Between the early 2000s and 2030, the global absolute num- ber of cancer cases is pr ojected by UN agencies to double, most of all in the middle- and low-income countries of Africaand Asia. Some of this increase can be attributed to the 25-29 had a BMI of 27.4, and 30-65 year olds had a BMI of between 28 and 30.46 While 23.1 per cent of women aged 20-24 had a BMI of over 30, this rose to 30.9 per cent of women aged 25-29, and to more than 40 per cent of those aged 55-64.46The obesity epidemic began earlier in the USA than in other high-income countries. Between 1906 and 1962, 10.4 per cent ofmen and 15 per cent of women had a BMI of 30 or more. 46By 1999/2000, these figures had increased to 27.7 per cent of men and34 per cent of women (see figure). 46In 2002 a US health survey found that almost 75 per cent of people were trying to prevent weight gain.106See figure 1.4 for projec- tions of the proportions of men and women who will have a BMI of 30 or more in 2015.46 The average amount of available food energy rose between 1964 and 2004, fromaround 2930 to 3750 kcal/person per day (12 250 to 15 690 kJ/person per day). 1 Between 1977 and 1996, the average pro- portion of meals eaten in restaurants orfast-food outlets r ose fr om 9.6 to 23.5 per cent, and fast food now accounts for 20 per cent of dietary energy. 2 Vegetable and fruit intakes have increased since the 1980s across all income levels, and people now eat more fresh andfrozen vegetables and fr uits than canned. Potatoes are commonly eaten. Bananas are the most popular fruit. 34More than 80 per cent of men and 70 per cent ofwomen aged 20-64 fail to eat the r ecom - mended five daily portions of vegetablesand fruits. Between 1970 and 2000, average populationconsumption of meat and poultry per person increas-ed by 11 per cent: people ate less beef but more poultry. 16 Analysis of national food surveys de- monstrated thatbetween 1977 and 2001, people con- sumed more sweet- ened drinks and less milk. The portion sizes of sweetened drinks increased and they contributed more energy todiets: an incr ease from 50 to 140kcal/person per day (210 to 600 kJ/per-son per day). During the same period, fruit drinks increas-ed from 20 to 45 kcal/person per day (80 to 190 kJ/personper day); ener gy intake fr om milk dr opped from 140 to 100 kcal/person per day (600 to 410 kJ/person per day), with the largestdrop in milk consumption among those aged 2-18. 31Another study r evealed that 93 per cent of young people ate snack foodsand they consumed one third of their total energy away from home.2Energy from soft drinks, fast foods, and salty snacks doubled between 1977 and 1996, and soft drinks now pr ovide 8.5 per cent of total energy in young people' s diets.2 Increases in BMI USA Data from World Health Organization46Non-communicable causes of death USA Data from World Health Organization46Cardiovascular disease Cancer Respiratory disease Diabetes OtherPer cent of deaths 41 298418Age-standardised rates of common cancers USA Age-standardised rate per 100 000 Data from International Agency for Research on Cancer20Lung Colorectu mProstate Bladder page 2926PART I BACKGROUND In 2004 Mexico had a population of over 107 million. The country has an upper-mid- dle-income economy, with a gross domes- tic product of 10158 international dollars per person (figure 1.3). Life expectancy at birth is 72 years for men and 77 for women(figure 1.1). 46 Chronic diseases account for 72.4 per cent of all deaths, while infectious diseases, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional condi- tions account for 16.5 per cent; 16.49 per cent of deaths are due to injuries. The first figure below gives a breakdown of the deaths caused by chronic diseases.46 Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men, followed by lung, stom- ach, and colorectal cancers. Cancer of the cervix is the most common type in women, followed by cancers of the breast, stomach, and ovar y (for age-standar dised rates of these cancers, see the second figur e below).20Women living in rural areas have a higher risk of cancer of the cervix com- pared with those living in urban areas.32 Stomach cancer incidence has risen since 1980, and this increase is more evident in men.20 In 2002-2003, 17 per cent of men and 18 per cent of women aged 18-69 wer e clas - sified as sedentar y (figur e 1.6).46 Between 1995 and 1999, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children rosefrom 13.6 per cent to 19.5 per cent. 18 Geographically, the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity is in Mexico City and in the northern region. Across thecountry as a whole, girls are more likely tobe overweight or obese. 18One fifth of school-age children are overweight or obese, and the risk of body fatness rises if their mother has a school education andhigher socioeconomic status. 18Men aged 20-29 had an average body mass index (BMI) of 25.2, while those aged 30-39 hada BMI of 26.9, and men aged 40-59 had a BMI of 27.5. While 11.8 per cent of men aged 20-29 had a BMI of over 30, 46this rose to 20.9 per cent of 30-39 year olds.46 Around 25 per cent of men aged between 40 and 69 had a BMI of over 30. Womenaged 20-29 had an average BMI of 25.6. 46 This rose to 27.9 for those aged 30-39, and to 29 for women aged 40-69. While 16.7per cent of women aged 20-29 had a BMI of over 30, this rose to 29.6 per cent of those aged 30-39. Around 40 per cent of women aged 40-59 had a BMI of over 30. 46 See figure 1.4 for projections of the pro- portions of men and women who will havea BMI of 30 or mor e in 2015. 46 The average amount of available food ener gy rose between 1964 and 2004, from around 2470 to 3150 kcal/person per day(10350 to 131780 kJ/person per day). 1 In 1999, micronutrient deficiencies re- mained a pr oblem.36Under nutrition was more prevalent in the indigenous popula- tion, in people of lower socioeconomicstatus, and in rural areas and the south. One in five children under the age of 5 years was stunted, and 2 per cent wereclassified as suf fering fr om wasting. Rates of stunting and wasting were three times higher in rural than urban areas, and werehigher in the south of the country than the north. Folate intakes were lower in urban areas, in the north of the country, and in Mexico City, compared with the south and in rural areas. 7This demonstrates regional differences in diets, particularly in the amounts of green, leafy vegetables people eat. Preschool children in the north and in Mexico City had the highest intakes of fat and the lowest intakes of dietary fibre. Children in the south, those indigenous to the country, and those of lower socioeco- nomic status had higher intakes of dietary fibre and starchy foods, the lowest fat intakes, and the highest risk of inadequate micronutrient intakes for vitamin A, vita- min C, folate, calcium, iron, and zinc.7In women, there was a risk of inadequate vit- amin A, vitamin C, and folate intake. Consumption of star chy staple foods and intakes of folate, calcium, and iron weresignificantly higher in rural women com- pared with those living in urban areas. Saturated fatty acid consumption waslower in the south, reflecting the greater contribution of beans and cereals (grains) in diets. 6Women in urban areas, and those of higher socioeconomic status, consumedmore cholester ol, saturated fatty acids, and total fat. 6Across the country as a whole, dietary fibre consumption was found to beinadequate, but intakes wer e higher in central and south Mexico, mainly because people' s diets contained beans and cer eals (grains), although their intake of vegeta-bles and fruits was low.Mexico Age-standardised rates of common cancers Mexico Age-standardised rate per 100 000 Data from International Agency for Research on Cancer20Lung ColorectumProstate Stomach Breast Ovary051015202530 StomachCervixMen Women Non-communicable causes of death Mexico Data from World Health Organization46Cardiovascular disease Cancer Respiratory disease Diabetes OtherPer cent of deaths 31 18 8162827CHAPTER 1 INTERNATIONAL VARIATIONS AND TRENDS In 2004 the population of Australia was over 20 million. The country has a high- income economy, with a GDP of 31 454 international dollars per person (figure 1.3).46Life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 83 for women (figure 1.1).46 Chronic diseases account for 86.9 per cent of all deaths, while infectious diseases, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional condi- tions account for 4.7 per cent; 8.4 per cent of deaths are due to injuries. The first fig- ure below gives a breakdown of the deaths due to chronic diseases.46 In men, prostate cancer is the most com- mon type and rates have doubled since the 1970s. Colorectal cancer has increased and lung cancer has declined slightly. There has been a large increase in the incidence of melanoma and a slight increase in bladder cancer . In women, br east cancer is the most common type and the rate has incr eased since the 1970s. Colorectal cancer is thenext most common type, although this has remained stable. There has been a large increase in melanoma, and lung cancer has doubled since the late 1970s, although can-cer of the endometrium has remained sta- ble (for age-standardised rates of thesecancers, see the second figur e below). 20 In 2001, 30 per cent of men and 32 per cent of women aged 15-75 were classified as sedentary.46 In the same year , men aged 18-24 had an average body mass index (BMI) of 24.3, while those aged 25-29 had a BMI of 25.3,and men aged 30-75 had a BMI of between 26 and 27.5. 46Of men aged 18-24, 34.3 per cent had a BMI of over 25.46This rose to 43.8 per cent of those aged 25-29, and to between 50 and 70 per cent of men aged 30-75.46Between 17 and 20 per cent of men aged 35-69 had a BMI of over 30.46The average BMI of women aged 18-24 was 22.8.46This rose to 24.9 for women aged 30-34, and those aged 40-75 had a BMI of between 25 and 27.1.46The proportion of women with a BMI of over 25 increased with age: 19.9 per cent of women aged 18-24, and 34-55 per cent of those aged 30-75. Overall, between 15 and 20 per cent of women aged 30-75 had a BMI of over 30.46There has been a steady increase in BMI since 1980, when 40.6 per cent of men and 20.2 per cent of women had a BMI of 25 or more, and 9.3 per cent of men and 8 per cent of women had a BMI of 30 or more.46In 2000, 48.2 per cent of men and 29.9 per cent of women had a BMI of 25 or more, and 19.3 per cent of men and 22.2 per cent of women had a BMI of 30 ormore. 46See figure 1.4 for projections of the proportions of men and women who will have a BMI of 30 or mor e in 2015.46 The average amount of available food energy remained stable between 1964 and 2004: around 3130 and 3120 kcal/person perday respectively . 1The most r ecent National Nutritional Survey in 1995 found that 90 per cent of the people surveyed ate cereals(grains) or cer eal pr oducts, and milk or milk products, the day before the interview. However , half of the men and one thir d of the children had not eaten fruit, and 20 percent of children had not eaten vegetables the day befor e the interview. Fruit con-sumption was decreasing in adolescents, although the intake of milk products was declining only among girls. Fewer adoles- cents ate cereals (grains) compared with other age groups, although cereals and cereal products contributed 34-37 per centof their total dietary energy. Cereal products contributed the greatest amount of food by weight to adults' diets, followed by milk and milk products, then pulses (legumes). Fruit consumption increased with age, whereas intakes of cereals (grains), milk, meat, and poultry decreased. Adults in the Northern Territory consumed more meat, poultry, game, and alcoholic drinks, and less veg- etables and fruits, than people living in other areas. Men were slightly more likely to eat food away from home (64 per cent) compared with women (57 per cent). Almost one thir d of adults thought that they should be eating mor e fruit, and 25 per cent thought they should eat fewer high-fatfoods. 4Fruit and vegetable consumption was highest in 18-39 year-olds, with 40-50 per cent consuming a combination of atleast one portion of fruit and three portions of vegetables each day, although this amount then declined steadily with age.Only 37.6 per cent of childr en (12-17 year olds) ate this quantity of vegetables andfruits and, in total, 37.2 per cent of people over the age of 12 failed to eat this amount.A study of people aged 20-75 living in Queensland found that 63 per cent of par- ticipants drank too much alcohol, 40 percent were not sufficiently physically active, and less than half ate the recommended lev- els of fr uits and vegetables. 13Australia Age-standardised rates of common cancers Australia Age-standardised rate per 100 000 Data from International Agency for Research on Cancer20LungColorectumProstate of death Australia Data from World Health Organization46Cardiovascular disease Cancer Respiratory disease Diabetes OtherPer cent of deaths 397 3531728PART I BACKGROUND In 2004 Brazil had a population of over 185 million. The country has a middle-income economy, with a gross domestic product of 8140 international dollars per person (fig- ure 1.3), which masks extreme socioeco- nomic inequalities.46Life expectancy at birth is 67 years for men and 74 for women (figure 1.1).46 Chronic diseases account for 75.3 per cent of all deaths, with infectious diseases, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional con- ditions accounting for 16.2 per cent; 8.5 per cent of deaths are due to injuries. The first figure below gives a breakdown of deaths caused by chronic diseases.46 Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men. This is followed by lung, stom- ach, colorectal, and bladder cancers. Breast cancer is the most common type in women,followed by cancers of the cervix, colorectum, stomach, and lung (for age-standardised ratesof these cancers, see the second figur e below). 20Age-standar dised mor tality rates for childhood cancers have declined since 1980 and there has been a decrease in mortalityfrom oral and phar yngeal cancers since the early 1980s. 9These figures may representimproved provision of healthcare rather than changes in incidence. In 1997, 28 per cent of men and 31 per cent of women aged 18-69 were classified as sedentary (figure 1.6).46 In 1997 men aged 20-65 had an average body mass index (BMI) of between 23 and 25.46Just 2.1 per cent of men aged 20-24 had a BMI of over 30, rising to 9.1 per cent of 30-34 year olds, 11.4 per cent of 40-44 year olds, and 12.3 per cent of men aged 50-54.46Women aged 20-39 had an average BMI of between 22.5 and 24.9, while from age 40 onwards, average BMI remained between 25 and 27.46Just 5.2 per cent of women aged 20-24 had a BMIof over 25, rising to 17.4 per cent of those aged 40-44, and 25.5 per cent of women aged 60-64. 46The proportion of men and women with a BMI of 30 or more has increased steadily since the mid-1970s.46In 1975, just 2.1 per cent of men and 6 percent of women had a BMI of 30 or mor e; this rose to 6.4 per cent and 12.4 per cent in 1996/7. 46See figure 1.4 for projections of the pr opor tions of men and women who will have a BMI of 30 or more in2015.46In 1975, for every obese woman, approximately another two were under- weight. Between 1975 and 1989, theprevalence of underweight almost halved, while the prevalence of obesity doubled; so by 1997 there were two obese womenfor every underweight woman. 28 The average amount of available food energy rose between 1964 and 2004, from2313 to 3157 kcal/person per day (9684 to 13 218 kJ/person per day), largely due to an increase in the availability of meat andoils. 1In one study, people living in urban areas ate more vegetables and fruits than those living in rural areas; intake increasedwith age, schooling, and income. However, only 41 per cent of adults reported eating fruit every day and 30 per cent reported daily vegetable intake. 21Wasting and stunting in children due to undernutrition have decreased rapidly since 1975, although it r emains a major pr oblem in the north-eastern region of the country. Obesity among children is low, but thosefrom higher income households in the eco- nomically developed south-eastern region are mor e likely to be overweight. 28Brazil Non-communicable causes of death Brazil Data from World Health Organization46Cardiovascular disease Cancer Respiratory disease Diabetes OtherPer cent of deaths 48 2011615 Age-standardised rates of common cancers Brazil Age-standardised rate per 100 000 Data from International Agency for Research on Cancer20Lung ColorectumProstate BladderStomach Breast Colorectum Lung0102030405060 StomachCervixMen Women29CHAPTER 1 INTERNATIONAL VARIATIONS AND TRENDS general projected increase in global population; to ageing populations; and to improved surveillance, detection and, inthe case of prostate cancer, screening and diagnosis. Nevertheless, at the global level, a real, age-adjusted, popu- lation-adjusted increase in cancer rates is projected. These projections show that any global 'war on cancer' is not being won. It follows that soundly based policies and effective pro-grammes to prevent cancer \u2014 which is to say, to decrease the risk of cancer \u2014 need not be accompanied by a decrease in the overall numbers of people suffering and dying from cancer. This ominous prospect should be put in context. First, both actual numbers and also age-adjusted rates of some cancersare decreasing in high-income countries, and rates of stom-ach cancer are generally decreasing worldwide. Second, the remarkable differences in the numbers of different cancers, and in their incidence over time, show that most cancer is,at least in principle, pr eventable. Thir d, the theme of this Report, correlations between changes in patterns of diet, physical activity , body composition , and changes in patterns of cancer provide evidence that these factors are important modifiers of cancer risk. Furthermore, as shown in Part 2 of this Report, overall the evidence is a reliable basis for recommendations designed toprevent cancer. The evidence shows that, together with expo-sure to tobacco smoke, key aspects of food and nutrition, physical activity , and body composition ar e or may be caus- es of important cancers of some sites. Unlike tobacco, the evi- dence also shows that other aspects pr otect against a number of common cancers. This indicates that many cancers are preventable not only in principle, but potentially also inpractice.Continued from page 2530PART I BACKGROUND The cancer process Food and nutrition modify the risk of cancers at a large number of sites. This means that some foodsand drinks, dietary constituents (or their balance indiets), and methods of food production, processing, preservation, and preparation influence the development of some cancers. More recently,evidence has accumulated about the ef fects of physical activity and body composition on the risk ofanumber of cancers, suggesting that bioener getics is another factor determining cancer risk and tumourbehaviour. Since the mid-1990s, great progress has been made in understanding the cancer process, and whichinternal and external factors modify cancer risk.Mapping of the human genome has enabled theestablishment and development of new disciplinesdevoted to understanding biological processes atthe most basic level, including those that pr event cancer, those that cause cancer, and those thatmodify its behaviour. Evolution in living or ganisms depends on the accumulation of adaptations as a result of changesin the expression of the genetic information carriedin DNA. Even with no changes in the DNA,alterations in how the message in the genetic code istranslated can lead to functional changes. Mor e impor tantly ,the DNA itself is susceptible to mutation \u2014 changes in the genetic code itself \u2014 as a result of damage from external causes such asradiation or simply due to the process ofmetabolism. Such mutations ar ethe essential basis for human evolution, by producing adaptations that arebeneficial in par ticular environmental circumstances. At the same time, some mutations can contribute to the harmful changes in cells that eventually lead to cancer. The integrity of the genetic infor mation is protected by many systems that prevent DNA damage, or remove or repair damaged DNA if it occurs. Imperfections in these systems limit theability to block all damage and allow both helpfuland har mful mutations to occur. Cancers result when sufficient mutations have accumulated, most presenting at an age that was rarely reached in the evolutionary past of human beings. Thedevelopment of cancer may be seen as a cor ollar yofCHAPTER 2 the ability of humans to evolve and adapt. Ultimately it is both the genetic information (genotype) and its expression that control thecharacteristics (or phenotype) of an individual. Any exposure during the life course that affects the genotype or its expression may also have an effecton the phenotype. At any point in time, thephenotype is related not only to the genotype butalso to a host of envir onmental factors, including nutritional exposures. This accumulated metabolicexperience may begin during maternal and early life,and proceed throughout a person's lifetime. The purpose of this second introductory chapter is to summarise current knowledge and thinking on thebiology of the cancer pr ocess, with special reference to food and nutrition, physical activity ,and body composition. In Part 2 of this Report, epidemiologicaland mechanistic evidence is summarised, and thePanel's assessments and judgements are made,based on a balance of all relevant evidence.31CHAPTER 2 THE CANCER PROCESS This chapter summarises the wealth of biological evidence that documents the ability of food and nutrition, physicalactivity, and body composition to influence several stages ofthe process of the development of cancer. Nutrients and food constituents have effects that can either inhibit several events that lead to cancer, or contribute tocancer development, by altering DNA itself ,or by altering how the genetic message in DNA is translated. Physical activity and variations in body composition also appear to influence cancer risk. Indeed, overall dietary patterns can indirectly influence cell growth by way of changes in gen-eral metabolic, regulatory, and endocrine effects. The normal functioning of all biological processes, includ- ing those of the human body, depends on the availability ofsubstrate and nutrients. Good nutrition \u2014 defined as appr o- priate pr ovision of food and nutrients fr om the level of the whole organism to the cellular and intracellular level \u2014 is needed for normal structur eand function .When a person is not suitably nourished, either through under- or overnutri- tion, this impacts on the tissue microenvironment, compro-mising both structur eand function . Understanding the mechanisms underlying cancer devel- opment is central to improving its prevention and treatment.The main body of this Report comprises the Panel's judge-ments on a series of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) onevidence linking food, nutrition ,and physical activity to can- cer.All evidence on the mechanisms of the cancer pr ocess is also based on rigor ous review criteria. However, the evidence presented in this chapter is a summary of this literature, and the references cited are illustrative examples only. Full detailsof the methods used for the r eviews are contained in the SLR specification manual. The full SLRs and this manual are con- tained on the CD included with this R eport. 2.1 Basic concepts and principles 2.1.1 Cancer Cancer is a group of more than 100 diseases characterised by uncontrolled cellular growth as a result of changes in the genetic information of cells. Cells and tissues are complex sys- tems with critical stages and checkpoints to ensur enormal growth, development, and function .Normally the division ,dif- ferentiation, and death of cells are carefully regulated. All can- cers start as a single cell that has lost control of its normalgrowth and r eplication pr ocesses.Human adults are made up of around 10 13(or 10 000 000 000 000) cells, which are renewed and replacedconstantly. About 5-10 per cent of cancers result directlyfrom inheriting genes associated with cancer, but the major- ity involve alterations or damage accumulated over time to the genetic material within cells. The causes of damage areboth endogenous (internal) and ex ogenous (envir onmental). Food, nutrition, and physical activity are important envi- ronmental factors in the development of cancer . Cancer can also be seen as a group of diseases that affects many different tissues and types of cell, and can be definedby their tissue of origin. Approximately 85 per cent of adultcancers develop from the epithelial cells of the inner andouter linings of the body and are called carcinomas. Cancersof glandular tissue such as the br east are called adenocarci- nomas; cancers fr om bone and muscle derived fr om meso- derm cells (embryonic cells that grow to form muscle, blood, bone, and connective tissue), ar ecalled sar comas. Each type of cancer has different characteristics, but one feature of all these diseases is unregulated cell growth and/orcell death. Apart fr om haematological cancers such as leukaemias, this results in a tumour or mass, and cancerous cells often invade the surrounding tissue. Spread of cancercells from the primary site to other parts of the body is calledmetastasis. Benign tumours do not invade or metastasise.Malignant tumours do not r emain localised but can invade and/or metastasise. 2.1.2 Genetic material The genetic material of mammalian cells is composed of dou- ble-stranded DNA made fr om four organic bases \u2014 cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine \u2014 within a helical spine comprising deo xyribose (a sugar) and phosphate. The com - bination of a base with phosphate and deo xyribose is called anucleotide. Humans have 3 billion base pairs in the DNA code that encode approximately 30 000 different genes. The nucleus of a cell contains DNA ,and the information in the code is 'read' to generate proteins in the cytoplasm of the cell. This is achieved by transcribing the DNA into RNA,and then translating the information in RNA to synthesise protein. For transcription, the two DNA strands separate and an intermediar y, complementary copy of the DNA is made from mRNA (which differs slightly in structur efrom DNA and is single stranded). For translation, the RNA leaves the nucleus and binds to an organelle in the cytoplasm called theribosome. The RNA nucleotides encode for 21 differ ent 32PART I BACKGROUND amino acids, with the ribosome moving along the RNA mol- ecule and translating the genetic code into a sequence ofamino acids that build into a pr otein . The normal metabolic processes in cells are controlled by proteins, each of which is a pr oduct of a single gene fr om the DNA in the nucleus. Although each cell in the body contains exactly the same genes, cells from different organs have dif-ferent structur es and functions because ther eis a pr ocess of regulation that determines which genes are expressed; that is, which genes are turned on and which are not (see 2.2.2).This differential gene expression varies not only from tissueto tissue but also from time to time over the course of a per-son's life, from embryonic and fetal stages onwards (box 2.1). Gene expr ession is r egulated by promoter regions of genes in the DNA ,aswell as by epigenetic factors \u2014 those that alter gene expression without changing the nucleotide sequence (see 2.2.3). The availability of nutrients within the immedi-ate envir onment influences these processes (figure 2.1). 2.1.3 Nutrigenomics and cancer Unravelling links between diet and cancer is complex, as thousands of dietary components are consumed each day; a typical diet may provide more than 25000 bioactive foodconstituents. 1Assessing intak es of some constituents is dif - ficult due to wide variations in the amounts of bioactive com- ponents within a particular food.23Dietary constituents modify a multitude of processes in both normal and cancer cells.45 The response is further complicated since a single, bio- active food constituent can modify multiple steps in thecancer process. Likewise, many of these processes can be influenced by several food components. Normal and cancercells also differ in their r esponses to bioactive foodcomponents in terms of the dose (quantity), timing, and duration of exposure required to bring about effects. To unrav-el the contribution of nutrition to cancer, the biological processes underpinning cancer development need to be under- stood. Extensive evidence existsfor nutritional factors in sever- alprocesses related to cancer development (figure 2.2). However, because of the com- plexity of the process, it is notpossible to conclude that mod-ifying any one, or more, ofthese processes influences cancer risk. The recent expansion of knowledge in molecular biolo - gy has allowed new techniques to be developed to explain these mechanisms. Nutri- genomics is a new field withprofound implications in cancerprevention and therapy, since it seeks to clarify the impact of nutrition in the maintenanceof genome stability ,and to dissect out the influence of geno- type in determining our r esponse to diet. Nutrigenomics is the study of nutritional influences on the phenotypic vari- ability of individuals based on genomic diversity (figur e2.1). This determines the sequence and functions of genes, and studies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and ampli-fications and deletions within the DNA sequence as modi - fiers of the response to foods and beverages and their constituents. Nutritional epigenomics is another key deter-minant of gene expression patterns. It includes non-codingmodification of genes (such as methylation, changes in his-tone homeostasis, miRNA ,and DNA stability) in response to nutrition .Nutritional transcriptomics is the study of gene expression patterns at the RNA level, and it can identify common nutritional response elements in gene promoters that can be modulated by diet. Proteomics studies the pro-teins that can be expr essed by a cell, many of which can be influenced by nutrition. Metabolomics studies the range of metabolic pr ocesses in a cell and metabolic r egulation in cells or tissues, which again ar eheavily influenced by food, nutrition, and physical activity. 2.2 Cellular processes The role of nutrition in cancer depends on how it impacts on fundamental cellular processes including the cell cycle (figur e2.3; also see 2.5.1). To understand cancer biology, it is important first to understand normal cellular pr ocesses. The integrity of tissues and organs depends on a regulated balance between cell proliferation and death, and appro-priate cell differ entiation .This r egulation is controlled by The genetic message in the DNA code is translated into RNA, and then into protein synthesis, and so deter mines metabolic pr ocesses. Resear ch methods called '-omics' addr ess these different stages.33CHAPTER 2 THE CANCER PROCESS several types of genes including oncogenes and tumour sup- pressor genes (box 2.2), and factors in the cellular environ- ment that influence their expression. Maintenance of the DNA sequence and structure as cells divide is essential: sev-eral cellular mechanisms exist to ensure this is achieved. 2.2.1 Cell signalling Cells detect and respond to external stimuli and send mess- ages to other cells through a molecular mechanism knownas cell signalling. Cells within a tissue normally communicate with each other through a network of locally produced chemicals called cytokines (including some growth factors). Cell proliferation is a tightly controlled and coordinated process, and is stim-ulated by growth factors. These soluble proteins can be pro-duced locally, either from the same cell (autocrine), or fromdifferent cells (paracrine), or as hormones (endocrine) pro- duced by a distant tissue and transported in the blood. Growth factors bind to specific receptors on the cell surfaceand transmit a signal into the cell, which is r elayed to the nucleus. In the nucleus, genes are switched on to produce the pr oteins necessar yfor cell division . Getting the growth signal from the outside of the cell to the nucleus requires a series of steps. The shape of the recep-tor changes when the growth factor binds to it, which caus-es part of the receptor to become activated, usually by aprocess called phosphorylation. A regulated process of phos- phorylation and dephosphorylation is necessary for the appropriate initiation, transmission, and cessation of signals. 2.2.2 Gene expression Gene expression is the process by which the information within a gene is 'turned on' or 'turned off'. The information is used to create the associated proteins and modify the amounts produced. Also see figure 2.1. Transcription factors are proteins involved in the regula- tion of gene expression and carry the signal from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. They bind to the promoter regions of genes and have the effect of either switching gene expression on or off. There are also nuclear receptors, suchas retinoic acid receptors, that function as transcriptionfactors by binding directly to specific DNA sequences. Some so-called 'housekeeping' genes are expressed by almost all cell types. These genes generally encode proteins that participate in basic cell functions such as metabolicpathways and synthesis, and pr ocessing of DNA ,RNA,or pro- teins. Other genes have more restricted expression, and areexpressed only in specific cell types, and/or stages of development. Gene expression can also be influenced by changes outside the DNA of genes. DNA is closely organised and tightly pack-aged in the nucleus of cells. To achieve this, DNA is spooled around proteins called his- tones. Histone structur ecan be either methylation, morecommonly by acetyla - of an acetyl group). Acetylation anddeacetylation (r emoval) ar e transferase(HAT) histone deacety-lase (HDAC), e, is asso - ciated with enhanced tran - scription, whereas HDACs stabilise the structure withhigher levels of packaging, and so suppress transcrip- tion.Butyrate, pr oduced in (dietaryfibre), disulphide and sulphora-phane, a glucosinolate from cruciferous vegetables, can behave as histone deacety - lase inhibitors, 16and act to maintain DNA stability or enhance transcription. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) ar e Food, nutrition, obesity, and physical activity can influence fundamental processes shown here, which may promote or inhibit cancer development and progression.34PART I BACKGROUND RNA molecules that do not encode proteins; instead they function as negative regulators of gene expression. Somemutations in miRNAs have been associated with human can - cers, and they can function as oncogenes or tumour sup - pressor genes (box 2.2). miRNAs are short, single-stranded RNA molecules of appr oximately 22 nucleotides. F or instance, to silence (turn off) genes, they may bind to com- plementary mRNA sequences and degrade them before theyhave been translated. Pr ofiling miRNA signatur es within can - cer cells may aid the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of cancer. For example, a certain miRNA that is downregu-lated in lung cancer is associated with decreased survival. 17 Research on the interactions between nutrition and non-cod- ing RNA molecules is at an early stage but is potentially r el- evant to cancer . 2.2.3 Epigenetic regulation Gene expression can also be altered without changing the DNA sequence. This is called epigenetic modulation . Methylation of DNA \u2014 the addition of a methyl group (CH3)\u2014plays a r ole in gene silencing. Methylation occurs only to cytosine r esidues located next to guanine bases in the DNA sequence. These CpG dinucleotide sequences are found throughout the genome; in about half of all genes, clustersof CpG sequences, so-called 'CpG islands', ar elocated in the promoter region that normally functions to promote expres- sion of the gene. Transcription factors cannot bind to thesesites when methylated and so the gene is silenced. For active genes, the CpG islands in the promoter regions are general- ly not methylated. Contr olled DNA methylation also pr ovides a mechanism for cell differentiation. In normal cells, genes may be per- manently silenced so that they can no longer be expressed,in a way that is transmitted into daughter cells during celldivision (see 2.5.1), so maintaining the particular structur- al and functional characteristics of the cells of specific tissues. Dietar yconstituents contribute to epigenetic modulation of promoter regions in both normal and malignant cells. For example, dietar yfolate and other methyl-donors such as choline, methionine, and betaine are essential for DNA synthesis and epigenetic regulation of DNA. Appropriategene expr ession is maintained by opriate patterns folate is an important determinant of normal methylation. In addition, dietary constituents such as genis-tein, which do not provide methyl groups, have also beenreported to modify DNA methylation. Imbalances or lack of specific dietar yconstituents may potentially incr ease the risk of cancer by inducing an imbal - ance in DNA pr ecursors, leading to alter ed DNA synthesis and repair, and may impair appropriate patterns of DNA methylation, with consequences for gene expression. Forexample, inadequate folate availability means cells tend to incorporate uracil into DNA in place of thymine. Global hypomethylation of DNA is an early epigenetic event in cer - vical car cinogenesis, and the degr ee of hypomethylation increases with the grade of cervical cancer. 1819Global hypomethylation of DNA and site-specific hypermethylationmay also be r elevant in color ectal cancer . 20Ahost of bio - active food constituents from alcohol to zinc has been reported to influence DNA methylation patterns.Nevertheless, it remains to be determined how important these changes are in the overall cancer process. The poten- tial cancer -protective effects of green, leafy vegetables (see chapter 4.2) ar eoften attributed to their folate content. Folates function as a coenzyme in the metabolism of single- carbon compounds for nucleic acid synthesis and amino acidmetabolism.The best understanding of the impact of endogenous and exogenous factors on the cancer process will come from studies of the whole life course, and particularly ofcritical periods within it. Early nutritional exposure is an impor- tant determinant of phenotypic expressionduring later life and is likely to affect vul- nerability to chronic diseases, including cancer. 6During pregnancy, the nutrient demands of the fetus have to be satisfied. Although the mother's dietary intake is important in maintaining her own nutrientreserves, it is her nutrition status on enter- ing pregnancy that determines her capac- ity to deliver appropriate nutrients to thefetus. Any stress that modifies her nutri- tional state, either by changing appetite or altering nutrient demand, can impact on the availability of nutrients to the fetus. 7In experimental models, pregnant rats fed a low-protein diet resulted in overexposureof the fetus to maternal glucocorticoids. This led to a permanent alteration in hormonal status and metabolic responses in the offspring.89These effects were attrib- uted to differential methylation of certain glucocorticoid genes and could be mitigat- ed by maternal folic acid supplementation.4 Lower birth weight, followed by expo- sure to periods of rapid rates of growth, possibly due to energy-dense diets, is asso-ciated with development of metabolic syndrome during adult life. 6This is the clus- tering of several cardiovascular risk factorsincluding hypertension, abdominal obesi- ty, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes has been associated withincreased prevalence of some cancers, and risk of cancer shows a graded relationship with glycated haemoglobin (a measure of blood glucose control) throughout the nor-mal range. 10Metabolic syndrome may also increase cancer risk,11suggesting that themetabolic disturbances associated with this syndrome promote genetic instability. Growth and development are dependent on the supply of adequate energy andnutrients to match a person's needs. Famine exposure in women affects breast dysplasia later in life: girls exposed to famine beforethe age of 10 years have less dysplasia in later life, whereas those exposed after 18 years of age have more dysplasia than non-exposed women. This illustrates the impor- tance of timing of nutrition during key stages of development. 12 Greater body fatness later in life is linked to development of metabolic syn- drome and related health problems,including insulin resistance. The inflam- matory state associated with obesity also promotes cancer. 13In contrast, energy restriction (box 2.5) delays the onset of many age-related diseases, including cancer. Box 2.1 Nutrition over the life course35CHAPTER 2 THE CANCER PROCESS 2.2.4 Differentiation Cells become specialised to perform their particular function through a process known as differentiation. Although each cell within the body contains the entire genome with the same genes, only some genes are active in any one cell at any one time. Gene expression controls the subset of genes expressed and the timing of expression, and this distinguishes one cell type from another by determin- ing their particular structure and function. Hundreds of different cell types arise from one fertilised egg during development; this is achieved by proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. Stem cells are unspecialised but can give rise to different specialised cell types. A small population of cells within the tumour mass of several formsof human cancer, which have both the properties of stemcells and also the characteristics of transformed cells, maybe important for the development of these tumours. As yet, our understanding of cancer stem cells is basic, although the concept was proposed as early as 1875. 22Several groups have now isolated and identified cancer stem cells in both haematopoietic and epithelial cancers, including cancers of thebreast, 23brain ,2425ovary,26prostate,27colon ,28and stomach.29 It is clear that subtle changes in exposure to bioactive food constituents can have a profound effect on the differentiationof these cells. In early embryos, proliferation of embryonic stem cells increases the total number of cells. As the organism devel-ops, cells differ entiate and become specialised to their par- ticular function .Transcription factors specific to that cell type turn on genes for that particular lineage of cells, so deter- mining its structur eand function . At various stages of differentiation, cells become sensitiveto different growth factors. In the cancer process, one char- acteristic of cells that are accumulating DNA damage is that they become de-differentiated and undergo epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT), characterised by loss of cell adhesion and increased cell mobility. In addition, dur- ing differentiation, other genes can be silenced by chromatin modification, including DNA methylation and histone mod- ifications such as methylation and acetylation (see 2.2.2). Stem cells are found among differentiated cells in almost all adult tissues, where they maintain and regenerate tissues. Examples include haemopoietic stem cells for continuous generation of red and white blood cells, and stem cells in the basal layer of the epidermis and at the base of hair fol- licles in the skin, which can give rise to keratinocytes andhair follicles. Cellular differentiation also continues in solidtissues such as mammary tissue, which during pregnancy dif-ferentiates for later milk production. A systematic review has shown that long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in fish oils promote differentiation of colonic epithe-lial cells. 3031Vitamin D and r etinoic acid may also pr omote differentiation of cells. 2.2.5 DNA damage and repair Each time a cell divides into two new daughter cells, there is potential for an error in replication of the DNA (see 2.5.1).These mutations result in non-functioning genes or in pro-teins with altered amino acid sequences that can change cellfunction . DNA is continuously exposed to damage fr om pr oducts of normal intracellular metabolism, including reactive species, hydr oxyl radicals, and hydr ogen per oxide; and also to damage from external factors such as ultra-violet (UV) Oncogenes and tumour suppr essor genes arepresent in all cells, and in their normal, non-mutated for mcontribute to the regu- lation of cell division and death. In cancer , both types of gene are often mutated, andthese alterations contribute to the cancer process. The combined ef fect of activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes is an important driver of cancer progression. Oncogenes increase the rate of transfor- mation from a normal to a cancerous cell. Oncogene function is changed by mutation so that the protein product is produced either in greater quantities or has increasedactivity .The nor mal, non-mutated for mof an oncogene is called a pr oto-oncogene. More than 100 oncogenes have been identified, including ERBB2 in breast and ovarian cancers, members of the Ras familyin cancers of the lung, colorectum, and pan- creas, in lymphomas. Ampli - fication of the ERBB2 gene occurs in around 30 per cent of breast cancers, and RAS muta-tions occur in appr oximately 30 per cent of all human cancers (and in 75-90 per cent ofpancr eatic cancers). Tumour suppressor genes prevent exces- sive growth of a cell, either by controllingcell proliferation or by controlling DNA repair and genomic stability .Mutation of a tumour suppr essor gene r esults in the loss of function of the protein product. Common tumour suppressor genes inc- lude p53 and the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene.The p53 gene was the first tumour sup- pressor gene to be identified, and is con - sidered to be the guardian of the genome. 14 Under normal circumstances, p53 is involved in several pr ocesses such as cell pr olifera - tion, DNA r epair ,apoptosis, and angiogen - esis. p53 is activated by cellular stresses that could facilitate tumour development such as hypoxia, lack of nucleotides, and in partic-ular, DNA damage. In response, p53 can either halt the cell cycle to allow DNA repair, or induce apop-tosis. It can bind to the promoter regions ofappr oximately 300 dif ferent genes, ther eby having tant regulatory role in var- ious molecular pathways. The p53 pathway is alter ed in most cancers ,and the mutated protein product cannot protect the genome, allowing mutations to accumulate. In the absence of a functional Rb gene, the r etinoblastoma pr otein pRb is not made and its inhibitory role of inactivating cell cycle transcription factors is absent. This leads to increased, uncontrolled prolifera-tion, and thereby increased risk of further mutations. Mor ethan 2000 inactivating mutations of p53 have been identified in human tumours. Both p53 and pRb can alsobe inactivated by the human papillomavirus. Development of lung cancer is associ - ated with loss of function of both genes. Li- Fraumeni syndrome, a result of a germ line mutation in p53, leads to inherited susceptibility to a wide range of cancers. Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndr ome have a25-fold increased risk of developing cancer compared with the general population. 15Box 2.2 Oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes36PART I BACKGROUND light, as well as other environmental factors including food, nutrition, and physical activity (see 2.4). There are several mechanisms for DNA repair (box 2.3), a vital defence in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing a cell beingtransformed from normal to cancerous. Various studies suggest that nutritional status and/or cer- tain food constituents may influence DNA repair. Data from observational studies suggest that severe malnutrition can impair DNA repair. 34Nucleotide excision repair has been found to be lower in adults with the lowest intakes of folate.35Studies of healthy adults consuming kiwi coenzyme Q10(an impor- tant in vitro. Selenium induces base-excision repairin vitro via p53 activation in cultured fibroblasts. 39 Evidence exists that some dietary components can modify DNA damage and gene expression in exfoliated colonocytes. For example, the amount of single-strand breaks in exfoli- ated colorectal mucosal cells was significantly lower inhealthy individuals consuming a vegetarian diet compar ed with a diet high in meat. 40Similarly, DNA damage in exfo- liated lung epithelial cells can be influenced by dietar ycom- ponents. Consumption of a lycopene-rich vegetable juice was associated with significantly decreased damage to the DNAof lung epithelial cells in healthy volunteers. 41 Defects in any of the DNA repair mechanisms can predis- pose to cancer. Several inherited conditions link such defectsto cancer incidence. F or example, patients with hereditary non-polyposis color ectal cancer have defective mismatch repair (see chapter 7.9.2). Although the pr ocesses of cell development, signalling, and DNA repair are tightly controlled, errors will occur dur- ing the trillions of cell divisions that occur over a lifetime.This may r esult in inappr opriate pr oliferation or failur eof damaged cells to die. These changes could provide the altered cell with a growth advantage over the normal cellsin the tissue. If additional alterations occur, this can resultin a cell with the potential to become cancerous. 2.3 Car cinogen metabolism The chance of carcinogenesis occurring and then progress- ing is modified by many factors, including food and nutri - ion. Dietary constituents that modify carcinogenesis oduce intermediates that bind to and damage DNA. Phase Iand phase II metabolising enzymes in the liver and in other tissues ar einvolved in this pr ocess. These ar eenzymes that catalyse the metabolic detoxification of xenobiotics, drugs, and carcinogens produced through aerobic metabolism, andthus protect cells against oxidative stress and reactive elec- trophilic metabolites. Metabolic catalysed by the cytochr ome P450 (C YP) family of phase I enzymes through oxidation, which usually makes the molecule more water soluble. Some of the intermediates formed during thisprocess may be car cinogenic, and can bind to DNA ,formingDNA adducts. These adducts distort the structure of DNA and disrupt its replication, potentially causing mistranslation. They can also break the DNA strand, which can result in mutations or deletions of genetic material. In addition to P450 enzymes, other systems such as per- oxidases (including the cyclooxygenases) and certain trans- ferases, such as N-acetyltransferase and sulphotransferase, can influence carcinogen bioactivation.42-44 Competing with this metabolic activation of carcinogens is the detoxification process catalysed by a second group of enzymes, known as phase II enzymes.45They catalyse con- jugation reactions, producing molecules that can be excret- ed in bile or II enzymes is mediatedby the antioxidant response element, which is located in the promoter region of specific genes. 46 Each of these enzymes represents a potential target for dietar ycomponents to influence car cinogen activation . Specificity in response is evident since isothiocyanates from crucifer ous vegetables have been shown to induce expr ession of phase II detoxification enzymes without affecting expres- sion of phase I enzymes. The carcinogenic properties of polycyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic amines, N-nitroso compounds, and aflatoxins result from metabolism of these compounds, whichproduces carcinogenic by-products. Metabolising enzyme yfactors. The enzyme CYP3A4 participates in the metabolism of over half of all pharmaceutical agents, and is especially sensitive to dietary effects. For example, interactions have been report- ed between grapefruit juice, red wine, garlic, and variousdrugs. 47Food-drug interactions involving C YP1A2, C YP2E1, glucuronysyltransferases, and GSTs have also been documented.48 The activity of phase I and II enzymes, and thus carcino- gen metabolism and cancer development, varies betweenindividuals. SNP sin several phase I and phase II enzymes have been shown to modulate cancer risk. 49 50Thereis some difficulty in synthesising this evidence and some studies maygive false positive results. Nevertheless, the literature shows tantalising evidence that relates genetic diversity to theseenzymes in various pr ocesses linked to cancer development. Some specific examples of SNPs in cancer are listed below. GSTsareinvolved in the metabolism of environmental car- cinogens and r eactive o xygen species. P eople who lack these enzymes may be at higher risk for cancer because of a reduced capacity to dispose of activated carcinogens. 51As shown in chapter 4.1, aflato xins \u2014 pr oduced by moulds that contaminate certain types of foods such as cereals (grains) and peanuts \u2014 are carcinogens that are activated by phaseIenzymes in the liver into reactive DNA metabolites that cause DNA adducts. However, the number of adducts and therefore the potency of aflatoxin B are influenced by other enzymes such as GST s, which eliminate car cinogens befor e they can bind to DNA. Individuals with low expression of GSTs are also at higher risk for colorectal cancer; however,adiet high in isothiocyanates (derived fr om glucosinolates CANCER PROCESS in cruciferous vegetables) can ameliorate this.52 Epidemiological evidence supports the idea that individ - uals possessing these genotypes are predisposed to a num- ber of cancers, including those of the breast, prostate, liver,and colon 53;it also shows that nutrition influences cancer risk. Thus, an SNP in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reduc-tase (MTHFR) gene appears to influence folate metabolismby reducing MTHFR activity, and is associated with a reduc- tion in the risk of developing color ectal cancer . 54Certain SNPs in the N-acetyltransferase gene alter the activity of the enzyme (involved in the metabolic activation of heter ocyclic amines from meat cooked at high temperatures), and may also increase the risk of colon cancer. Again ,asdescribed in chapter 4.3, people whose diets ar e high in red and processed meat and who also carry an insert variant in CYP2E1, a key activating enzyme of many nitro-samines, have a greater risk of rectal cancer. 55Consumption of cruciferous vegetables protects against lung cancer in indi-viduals lacking the GSTM1 gene. 56In addition ,genes that predispose to obesity may pr omote obesity-related cancers (box2.4). Dietary components can either be, or be activated into, potential carcinogens through metabolism, or act to preventcarcinogen damage. For instance, as summarised in chapter 4.3, high intake of red meat may result in more absorption of haem ir on,greater oxidative stress, and potential for DNA damage. 57 58In addition ,iron overload can also activate oxidative responsive transcription factors and inflammation in the colon.59Red meat consumption is also associated with the formation of N-nitroso compounds. This incr eases the level of nitrogenous residues in the colon and is associated with the formation of DNA adducts in colon cells.60 Cruciferous vegetables contain glucosinolates, which are transformed by food preparation into isothiocyanates (ITCs), which alter the metabolism of car cinogens. Indoles ITCs, two major glucosinolate br P450isoenzymes, r espectively .Human intervention studies with cruciferous vegetables have demonstrated induction of GSTs by consumption of Brussels sprouts and red cabbage varieties, but not with white cabbage and broccoli. The particular isoform of theenzyme induced may protect against bladder cancer. Cruciferous vegetables also affect drug metabolism in humans, and red cabbage leads to specific changes in the patterns of meat-derived urinary mutagens. ITCs may also protect against mutations formed by tobacco carcinogens. 61 In a variety of animal studies, certain dietary components have shown a reduction in experimentally induced cancers. Rats fed ITCs developed significantly fewer oesophageal cancers due, in part, to inhibition of cytochrome P450- mediated bioactivation of the carcinogen. Dietary indole-3-carbinol inhibited spontaneous occurrence of endometrialadenocarcinoma and preneoplastic lesions in rats. 62 Flavonoids (polyphenolic compounds found in plant foods) may also alter carcinogen metabolism. Quercetin has been shown to inhibit the expression of cytochrome P450and phase I enzymes, and may r educe tobacco car cinogen activation. 63 Exposur eof vulnerable populations to ex cess amounts of dietary constituents, irrespective of whether they are nutri- ents or not, may actually increase the risk of cancer. In one example, consumption of beta-carotene supplements in smokers was associated with increased incidence of lungcancer. 64For most dietary components, there will be an upper thr eshold beyond which people may be exposed to adverse effects. Ther earealso concerns regarding excessive supplementation with folic acid, iron, copper, iodide, and selenium.65 2.4 Causes of cancer Anumber of different types of exogenous (environmental) factors are known causes of cancer. These include someaspects of food and nutrition that are established as car-cinogenic by the International Agency for R esearch on Cancer ,although it is difficult to estimate the pr oportion of cancers dir ectly attributable to these. 74Known causes of can - cer include tobacco smoking and its use, infectious agents, medication, radiation, and industrial chemicals, and alsosome factors within the scope of this r eport \u2014 carcinogenic agents in food and drink. Sometimes the extent to which cancer in general, or spe - cific cancers, may be modified by any factor ,arecalculated, and some of these figures are given here. However, these esti- mates should be treated with some caution. First, they are esti-mates, and cannot be exact, and so ar ebest given as ranges. Second, individual causes of cancer often interact with one another to increase or decrease risk, or are modifiers or pre-cursors of others; and some act together to produce a multi- plicative effect. This point is particularly important with food and nutrition ,which may have a substantial effect on the risk of a cancer with envir onmental causes other than food, nutri - tion, and physical activity. Third, it is sometimes assumed that once all factors that decrease (or increase) risk are addedtogether ,with allowance for unknown factors, such estimates Mammals have five types of DNA repair system32 33: Direct reversal corrects rather than removes damaged DNA bases. Base-excision repair corrects DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species, deamination, and hydroxylation arising from cellular metabolism and spontaneous depurination. Nucleotide-excision repair removes lesions that distort the structure of the DNA helix, such as pyrimidine dimers andDNA adducts. Homologous recombination and non-homologous end- joining repair double-strand breaks. Homologousrecombination is used when a second identical DNA copy is available, for example after replication; non-homologous end-joining re-links the 'broken' ends of a double-strandbreak. DNA mismatch repair detects and repairs copying errors made during replication.Box 2.3 Mechanisms for DNA repair38PART I BACKGROUND should add up to 100 per cent. This is not so. Reasonable esti- mates for a number of separate or interactive factors may add up to well over 100 per cent because of the interactions. 2.4.1 Endogenous causes 2.4.1.1 Inherited germ line mutations Asmentioned, only a minority (5-10 per cent) of cancers are linked to single inherited genes. Such inherited alterations are termed germ line mutations, and are passed on from eggor sperm DNA. Individuals with inherited germ line muta- tions will not definitely get cancer but have an increased risk of developing cancer compared with the general population. Often mutations in tumour suppressor genes (box 2.2) increase the chance of developing cancer at a young age.These include retinoblastoma (a rare cancer of the eye), Li-Fraumeni syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1,and kidney cancer in Von Hippel-Lindau disease. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility) genes cause 5-10 per cent of all breast cancer cases. These genesnormally pr oduce DNA r epair pr oteins. P atients with the syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis coli have a pre- disposition to color ectal cancer due to mutations in the ade - nomatosis polyposis coli tumour suppressor gene. 75Other common cancers, including those of the ovary, prostate, pan-creas, and endometrium, may be related to inherited muta-tions, but only in a small percentage of cases. The other type of genetic mutation \u2014 somatic gene changes \u2014 develops during the life course. Such somaticmutations ar enot passed on to offspring. This DNA damage is caused by exposure to external factors such as radiation or car cinogens, or harmful pr oducts of normal aer obic metabolism. 2.4.1.2 Oxidative str ess Reactive oxygen species generated through normal oxidative metabolism have the potential to cause extensive DNA dam-age. The body has several mechanisms, which can scavengereactive oxygen species to prevent such damage occurring,or block the effects. Reactive o xygen species cause oxidative damage to DNA. During r epair (see 2.2.5), the damaged, o xidised bases are excreted in the urine. Levels of urinary 8-hydroxy-2'- deoxyguanosine, an oxidative DNA damage adduct, can beused as an indicator of o xidative DNA damage in humans and rodents. Antioxidants can scavenge reactive oxygen species. Vitamins C and E can donate electr ons to fr ee rad- icals and block their damaging activity .Dietar yconstituents such as ITCs and polyphenols can also activate the signalling pathways that lead to activation of the antioxidant responseelement (see 2.3), and upr egulation of the expr of detoxifying enzymes. 2.4.1.3 Inflammation Inflammation is a physiological response to infection, foreign bodies, trauma, or chemical or other irritation ,and in the acute phase can be helpful. However ,chronic inflammation can result in DNA damage and cancer promotion. Chronically inflamed tissue is infiltrated with a variety of inflammator ycells that pr oduce a wide variety of bioactivechemicals. These include cytokines, growth factors, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, cyclooxygenase, and lipoxyge- nase products. A chronic inflammatory environment can increase proliferation and differentiation, inhibit apoptosis(programmed cell death), and induce angiogenesis (gener- ation of new blood vessels). Chronic inflammatory condi- tions, such as Barrett's oesophagus and ulcerative colitis, predispose to cancer. In Barrett's oesophagus, reflux of acid can cause the cells lining the gullet to undergo EMT , andsome areas can develop dysplasia and ultimately cancer. Around 1 per cent of people with Barrett's oesophagus will develop oesophageal cancer (this is between 30 and 125 times higher than the general population). Also see chapter 7.3.2. Approximately 5 per cent of patients with ulcerativecolitis, a form of irritable bowel disease, will develop coloncancer. Also see chapter 7.9.2. Epidemiological and experi-mental evidence has demonstrated that long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can inhibit cancer development in a number of tissues including colon,oesophagus, and br east. 76 Cancer induced by inflammation may be susceptible to nutritional influences. Thus, dietar yconstituents could be involved in generation of reactive oxygen species, could influence antioxidant defences, or could suppress the inflam-matory process. For example, the glucocorticoid receptorpathway and the vitamin D receptor are capable of sup-pressing inflammation. The immune system can be divided into innate and adap - tive r esponses. Innate immunity pr ovides initial defences. Adaptive immunity develops later and involves activation of lymphocytes and their differ entiation into effector and mem - ory cells. The 'immune surveillance' hypothesis proposes that both the innate and adaptive immune systems constantlysurvey for and eliminate newly formed cancer cells, and that onset and progression of cancer are kept under control by the immune system. 77Immunosurveillance requires that the immune system recognises something different about cancercells compared with normal cells within the same tissue -often differ ent proteins (termed tumour antigens) that are expressed on the surface of a cancer cell. This r ecognition of 'alter ed self' allows the immune sys- tem to generate a response to these tumour antigens. They can be proteins that are only expressed by cancer cells, andnewly expr essed during cancer development; or proteins that have become mutated during the cancer process and so are differ ent fr om the non-mutated protein; or proteins expressed due to differ entiation of cancer cells (termed dif - ferentiation antigens); or proteins that are normally expressed by cells but that are expressed at much higher lev-els by cancer cells. Evasion of immunosur veillance is some - times referred to as a further hallmark of cancer 78(see 2.5), although the evidence remains speculative. Specialised mucosal cells form the interface between the inside and outside of the body.79These are normally an effi- cient barrier against pathogens. The gut barrier consists ofgut-associated lymphoid cells that can sense pathogens, and participate in innate and adaptive responses. 80The function of these cells is dependent on nutrition.81 82For example, n- 3PUFAs can enhance immunity ,whereas high concentrations 39CHAPTER 2 THE CANCER PROCESS of n-6 unsaturated fatty acids can have a suppr essive effect.83 Various factors have been shown to modulate both inflam - mation and immunity, including vitamins A and E, copper, selenium, zinc, P UFAs, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from green tea.84Zinc deficiency can lead to abnor- malities in adaptive immune responses.85 Immune status and chr onic inflammation may explain pat - terns of cancer in different parts of the world. Cancers caused by infectious agents, such as those of the liver and cervix (seechapter 7.8 and 7.13) are more common in low-incomecountries, where undernutrition may impair acid, vitamin C, ir on,selenium, and zinc, sup- presses most immune functions and may fail to control chronic inflammation. 86 87By contrast, hormone-related cancers such as those of the br east and prostate are more common in developed countries. The cytokine IL -6 can act as a pr o- or anti-inflammatory cytokine. In cancer ,IL-6 can either stimulate pr oliferation or exert anti-tumour effects by enhancing both innate and adaptive immunity.88Dietary phytoestrogens, such as soy isoflavones, downr egulate IL -6 gene expr ession and thus potentially influence the development of hormone-related cancers.89 Circulating levels of IL-6 increase (up to 100-fold) following exercise; this reduces chronic by reducing pro-inflammatory mediators and elevating anti- inflammator ymediators.90Regular moderate and occasional vigorous physical activity has been associated with enhanced immunity,91but prolonged and intense physical activity can cause immune suppr ession that cannot be counteracted by nutritional supplements or antio xidants.83Physical activity does not incr ease pr o-inflam- matory cytokines, but instead increases anti-inflammatory mediators. Chronic consumption of alcohol alters both innate and adaptive immunity. Heavy drinkers are more vulnerable toinfections and, as shown in chapter 4.8, to liver cancer . 92One possible mechanism is alteration in hepatic metabolismresulting in functional iron deficiency that Hormones Lifetime exposur eto oestr ogen \u2014 increased by early menar- che, late menopause, not bearing childr en,and late (over 30) first pregnancy \u2014 raises the risk of, and may be seen as acause of, breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers in women .The reverse also applies: a reduction in lifetime exposure to oestrogen due to late menarche, early meno- pause, bearing childr en,and early pregnancy may reduce the risk of hormone-r elated cancers. Age at menar che and menopause are influenced by nutrition, with high-energy diets leading to early puberty and late menopause, and low-energy diets delaying puberty and advancing menopause. The oral combined contraceptive pill (containing both oestrogen and progesterone) has been estimated to halve therisk of ovarian cancer, if taken for 5 years or more. 96This protective effect can last for up to 15 years after women stop taking these oral contraceptives.97Using any type of oral contraceptive may also have a slight pr otective effect against bowel cancer.98In contrast, combined oral contraceptives can cause a slight and transient increase in breast cancer risk,but only for the duration of use. 99Theremay also be an As shown in Chapter 6, the overall evidence that body fatness is a cause of a number ofcancers is convincing. Some of the mecha- nisms by which body fatness increases the risk of cancer are well understood. Obesity influences the levels of a num- ber of hormones and growth factors. 66 Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin, and leptin are all elevated in obese people, and can promote the growth of cancer cells. In addition, insulin resistance isincreased, in particular by abdominal fat- ness, and the pancreas compensates by increasing insulin production. This hyper-insulinaemia increases the risk of cancers of the colon and endometrium, and possibly of the pancreas and kidney. 13Increased circulating leptin levels in obese individ- uals are associated hormones, including oestro- gens, andr ogens, and progesterone, are likely to play a r ole in obesity and cancer . Adipose tissue is the main site of oestrogensynthesis in men and postmenopausal women,13.The increased insulin and IGF-1 levels that accompany body fatness result in increased oestradiol in men and women,13and may also result in higher testosterone levels in women (extreme obesity can lead to polycystic ovary dis- ease). Increased levels of sex steroids arestrongly associated with risk of endome- trial and postmenopausal breast cancers, 69 70and may impact on colon and other can- cers. As shown in Chapter 6, body fatness probably protects against premenopausal breast cancer; this may be because obesewomen tend to have anovulatory men- strual cycles and thus reduced levels of oestrogen. Obesity is characterised by a low-grade chronic inflammatory state, with up to 40per cent of fat tissue comprising macro- phages. The adipocyte (fat cell) produces pro-inflammatory (IL)-6, and C-reactive protein, compared with lean people,71 as well as of leptin, which also functions asan inflammatory cytokine.72Such chronic inflammation can promote cancer development. Also as shown in Chapter 6, factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences, are a cause of a num-ber of cancers. Adult height is related to the rate of growth during fetal life and childhood. The number of cell divisions in fetal life and childhood, health and nutrition status in childhood, and age of sexual maturity can alter the hormonal microenvironment, and affect circulating levels of growth factors, insulin, and oestrogens. Taller people have undergone more cell divisions stimulated by IGF-1 and pituitary- derived growth hormone, 73and there is therefore more potential for error during DNA r eplication, which may r esult in cancer development.Box 2.4 Body fatness and attained height40PART I BACKGROUND increase in the risk of cervical cancer, although this is part- ly related to sexual behaviour.100 Studies of women taking oestrogen-only hormone replace- ment therapy have suggested that the risk of endometrialcancer is doubled after 5 years of use, 101and the risk of ovari- an cancer rises by 25 per cent after the same length of use.97 102 However, use of hormone replacement therapy that combines oestrogen and progesterone does not increase ovar- ian cancer risk and may even protect against endometrialcancer. 102 97 101 2.4.2 Exogenous causes 2.4.2.1 Tobacco use Tobacco causes an estimated 20 per cent of all cancer deaths, and an estimated total of 1.2 million in 2002.75Smokers have increased risk of a number of different cancers (seeChapter 7). Worldwide, around 80 per cent of lung cancer cases in men and 50 per cent in women are caused by tobacco smoking. 103 104In 2002, out of all new cases of cancer in low-income countries, over 1 in 5 in men and almost 4 per cent in women were attributable to tobacco. In high-income countries, one thir dof all new cancer cases in men and just over 1 in 8 in women were attributed to tobacco smoking. Cigarette smoke contains at least 80 known mutagenic carcinogens, including arsenic, cadmium, ammonia,formaldehyde, and benzopyrene. Each will have a separatemechanism for causing cancer .For example, following meta- bolic activation ,the activated derivative of benzopyr ene, benzo(a)pyrenediol epoxide, can form DNA adducts in lung epithelial cells. 105 Cigarette smoke is a powerful carcinogen and also a source of oxidative stress. Compared with non-smokers, activesmok ers have lower cir micronutrients including alpha-carotene, beta- carotene, cryptoxanthin, and ascorbic acid. 106 2.4.2.2 Infectious agents Infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites, can induce DNA damage and pr omote cancer development. Some infectious agents, including hepatitis viruses, the bac - terium Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) ,and parasites, also pro- mote cancer by causing chronic inflammation (see 2.4.1.3). Both DNA and RNA viruses can cause cancer ,although the mechanisms differ.75DNA viruses encode viral proteins that block tumour suppr essor genes, wher eas RNA viruses or retroviruses encode oncogenes (bo x2.2). Human papilloma virus is an established cause of cervical cancer, Epstein-Barr virus of nasopharyngeal cancer and lymphoma, and hepati-tis B and C infection of liver cancer . As summarised in Chapter 7, Hpylori is associated with stomach cancer, liver flukes (from eating raw or undercookedfreshwater fish) with liver cancer, and Schistosoma haema- tobium infection with bladder cancer. In most cases, infection with these agents by itself does not lead to cancer but is a contributor yor necessar yfactor in the cancer process. Multiple factors are thought to be important in determining why cancer is the result in onlysome cases. Approximately 1 in 4 cancers in low-income countries are estimated to be attributable to infection. In 2002, this rep- resented some 1.9 million cancers or close to 1 in 5 of all cancers worldwide 104.Inadequate nutrition or dietary imbal- ances can lead to immunodeficiencies and increased sus- ceptibility to infections. Dietary factors may influence host susceptibility to the viral infection or persistence of the infection. For example, high folate intake is thought to reduce the susceptibility toand the persistence of human papilloma virus. 107 2.4.2.3 Radiation Both ionising radiation and UV radiation damage DNA and act as carcinogens. This includes radiation used in X-rayradiographs and in the treatment of cancer. In 1982, thevarious forms of radiation were calculated to account for 3per cent of all cancer deaths. 74 Ionising radiation can cause DNA damage, both directly by causing breaks in the DNA strands, and indirectly by inter-acting with water molecules and generating r eactive o xygen species that damage DNA. Although sunlight causes DNA damage, it also induces production of vitamin D. One of its metabolites, 1-25-hydroxy- vitamin D, has antiproliferative and pro-differentiation effects in some cells mediated through the vitamin D receptor. Exposure to ionising radiation comes from cosmic radia- tion (air travel incr eases exposure), natural radioactivity present in r ocks and soil, medical exposure through X-rays, or atomic radiation from weapons and nuclear accidents. Ionising radiation incr eases the risk of various cancers, in particular leukaemias, and breast and thyroid cancers. UV light from sunlight or sunlamps is divided into three bands of wavelengths: UV A,UVB, and UVC. UVB is the most effective carcinogen and is absorbed by bases in the DNA, causing characteristic patterns of DNA damage. UVA dam-ages DNA through generation of reactive oxygen species.UVC in sunlight is absorbed by ozone in the atmosphere and does not r each the surface of the earth. UV radiation causes both malignant melanoma and non-melanoma skincancer . It has been difficult to separate the effects of nutrients on DNA damage from those on repair, at least in animal orhuman studies. Ther eis some evidence that vitamin C and carotenoids can protect DNA against oxidative damage in some experimental settings. 108 2.4.2.4 Industrial chemicals Certain industrial chemicals and pesticides persist in the envir onment and become concentrated in the food chain. Some of these are within the scope of this Report and are summarised in Part 2. In 1982, industrial chemicals werecalculated to account for less than 1 per cent of cancer deaths. 74 Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organic compounds pre- viously used in plasticisers, adhesives, paints, and variousoils, do not readily degrade. They are soluble in fat rather than water and thus accumulate in carnivorous fish such assalmon ,and can be absorbed by people who eat these types 41CHAPTER 2 THE CANCER PROCESS of fish.109They also accumulate in human milk, and can be passed to the infant during breastfeeding. There is limited experimental evidence suggesting that PCBs have sex steroid activity and alter oestrogen levels, which may con-tribute to breast cancer risk. 109 Arsenic is genotoxic, causes gene mutations, and is car- cinogenic to humans; arsenic in drinking water is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.75The Panel's judgements on arsenic can modifythe urinary excretion of porphyrins in animals and humans. Italso interferes with the activities of several enzymes of the haem biosynthetic pathway. There is clear evidence that sele- nium binds heavy metals such as arsenic and thus modifies their absorption. 75 2.4.2.5 Medication Anumber of medical treatments modify the risk of some can- cers. As indicated in 2.4.2.3, X-rays are carcinogenic, as is radiation used as cancer treatment. Themost notorious example has been diethylstilboestr ol, once prescribed in pregnancy and now withdrawn, which caused cancers of the vagina and cer vix of female childr en born to mothers who received this drug. Treatments that affect hormonal status have been studied extensively and aredescribed in 2.4.1.4. Chemotherapy as cancer treatment dur-ing childhood is followed by an increased risk of lymphomain adulthood. 110 2.4.2.6 Carcinogenic agents in food Food may be contaminated with natural or man-made carcinogenic to xicants. These ar ewithin the scope of this Report, and are assessed and judged in Part 2. Moulds and the toxins produced by some moulds cause DNA adducts and ar ecarcinogenic. Aflato xin B, a pr oduct of the Aspergillus fungus and a common contaminant of cere- als (grains) and peanuts, is an established cause of livercancer (see chapter 4.1). Fumonisin B, a toxin produced bythe fungus Fusarium verticillioides ,may be found on maize and may be car cinogenic, although epidemiological studies arelacking. Some car cinogenic compounds ar eformed during food preparation (see chapter 4.3 and 4.9). Heterocyclic amines are formed by cooking meat at high temperatures, and poly-cyclic ar omatic hydrocarbons can be produced in meat and fish that has been grilled (broiled) or barbecued (charbroiled) over a dir ect flame. Also see bo x4.3.4. High environmental concentrations of polycyclic ar omatic hydr ocarbons, which also come from pollution caused by traffic and industry, can contaminate other foods such as cereals, vegetables, and fruits. Some N-nitroso compounds are carcinogens, and are formed in foods containing added nitrates or nitrites; exam-ples include fish and meat preserved with salting or preser- vatives, and smoking or drying. These carcinogens can also be generated fr om ingested foods containing or ealso pr oduced endoge - nously in the stomach and colon of people who eat large amounts of red meat or take nitrite supplements. Also seebox4.3.2.2.5 Nutrition and cancer The majority of cancers are not inherited. Cancer is, how- ever, a disease of altered gene expression that originates inchanges to DNA, the carrier of genetic information. For a cell to be transformed from normal to cancerous, it has to acquire different phenotypic characteristics that result from alter- ations to the genotype. Most cancers develop to the stage of being clinically identifiable only years or decades after theinitial DNA damage. Cancer development, or carcinogenesis, requires a series of cellular changes. No single gene causes cancer. It is a multi- step process caused by accumulated errors in the genes that control cellular processes. One genetic mutation may allowasingle trait (such as increased survival) to be acquired by alineage of cells, and descendants of these cells may then acquire additional genetic mutations. However, cancer only develops when several genes are altered that confer growth and survival advantages over neighbouring normal cells. The capacity of a cell to achieve effective cancer pr even- tion or repair is dependent on the extracellular microenvi- ronment, including the availability of ener gy and the presence of appropriate macro- and micronutrients. Tumours are not simply masses of cancer cells. Rather, they are het-erogeneous collections of cancer cells with many other celltypes \u2014 so-called stromal cells; cancer the tumour. The tumour microen-vironment comprises many cell types including infiltrating immune cells such as lymphocytes and macr ophages, endothelial cells, nerve cells, and fibroblasts. All these cell types can pr oduce gr owth factors, inflammator ymediators, and cytokines, which can support malignant transformation and tumour growth, and attenuate host responses. In addi-tion,factors pr oduced by the cancer cells themselves mod - ulate the activity and behaviour of the tumour stroma. Initiation is the exposure of a cell or tissue to an agent that results in the first genetic mutation. This can be an inherit-ed mutation or an exogenous or endogenous (producedthrough oxidative metabolism) factor. Even without exter- nal o xidative str ess, hundreds of sites within DNA are dam- aged each day but ar enormally r epaired or eliminated. Exposure to the carcinogen initiates DNA damage, usually via the formation of DNA adducts. If left uncorrected, theseadducts can be transferr ed to daughter cells during division and confer the potential for neoplastic (new and abnormal) growth. Initiation alone is insufficient for cancer to develop. An ini - tiated cell must go through a process of clonal expansion during promotion to become neoplastic; the larger the num-ber of initiated cells, the gr eater the risk of pr ogressing to cancer. Promotion involves exposure of the initiated cell to apromoting agent. This may allow alterations in the rate of proliferation or additional DNA damage to occur, leading to further mutations within the same cell, which alter gene expression and cellular proliferation. Finally, these initiated and pr omoted cells gr ow and expand to form a tumour mass. DNA damage continues at this stage and cancer cells often contain multiple copies of chromosomes. This clear, sequen-tial pr ocess is typical of experimentally induced cancers but 42PART I BACKGROUND may be less clear in sporadic cancers in humans. At the end of the multistage process of carcinogenesis, the cell will bear some or all of the hallmarks of cancer111(figure 2.4). Several genes can contribute to each hallmark and onegene (for example p53) can contribute to several of the hall- marks. These hallmarks or traits are shared by most, if not all, cancer cells. The six hallmarks of cancer cells are self- sufficiency in growth signals; angiogenesis; and tissue evasion and metastasis. 111 Food, nutrition, and physical activity-related factors influ- ence cellular processes and lead to cells accumulating these traits (figure 2.5). 2.5.1 Cell proliferation Three hallmarks of cancer, namely growth signal autonomy, evasion of growth inhibitory signals, and unlimited replication, promote enhanced cell proliferation. Over a normal human lifetime, approximately 1016(10000000 000000000) cell divisions will tak eplace. The sequence of stages of a cell dividing into two daughter cells is called the cell cycle (figure 2.3). Normal cells r equir eexternal signals fr om gr owth fac - tors, which stimulate them to divide. Proliferation of normal cells depends, in part, on the presence in the cellular envi-ronment of signals that both promote and inhibit growth, andthe balance between them. Most cells in adults are not in the process of actively divid- ing, but ar ein an inactive or quiescent state termed G. To re-enter the cell cycle, cells must be stimulated with gr owth factors and have sufficient space and nutrients for division. During the G 1phase, the cell incr eases in size, and syn - thesises RNA and proteins. At the end of the G1phase, cells must pass through the G1checkpoint, which arrests the cycle if damaged DNA is detected, ensuring that it is not r eplicat - ed. During the S phase, DNA is replicated. The S phase ends when the DNA content of the nucleus has doubled and thechromosomes have been replicated. When DNA synthesis is complete, the cell enters the G 2 phase, during which the cell continues to incr ease in size and produce new pr oteins. The G2checkpoint leads to arr est of the cell cycle in r esponse to damaged or unr eplicated DNA; otherwise the cell divides into two daughter cells during the M(mitosis) phase, and the M checkpoint ensures each daughter cell r eceives the correct DNA. The cell cycle is con- trolled by a set of proteins called cyclins and their specific cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). These join to formcyclin-CDK complex es, which activate transcription factors. This in turn activates transcription of the genes required for the next stage of the cell cycle, including the cyclin genes. In this section ,examples ar egiven to illustrate the known interactions between nutritional factors and these physio- logical processes. Among the modulators of cell-cycle progression are specific nutrients, which can either function as energy sources or regulate the production and/or function of pro- teins needed to advance cells thr ough the r eplicative cycle. Vitamin A, vitamin B12, folic acid, vitamin D, iron, zinc, and glucose all contribute to the control of cell cycle progression(figur e2.3).2.5.1.1 Growth signal autonomy Unlike normal cells, cancer cells are not dependent on exter- nal growth factors to stimulate their division. Instead, they can generate their own signals or respond to lower concen-trations of external signals. This frees cancer cells from the growth constraints of normal cells. 2.5.1.2 Insensitivity to antigrowth signals Normal cells also receive growth inhibitory signals. Indeed, most cells of the body are quiescent and not actively divid- ing. Cells respond to negative environmental signals such as contact with other cells. Cancer cells have acquired muta- tions that interfere with these pathways and so do not respond to growth inhibitory signals. 2.5.1.3 Limitless replicative potential Normal cells can divide a finite number of times. Once they have replicated 60 or 70 times they stop \u2014 a process termed senescence, which is thought to constitute a protective mech-anism against unlimited pr oliferation .This pr eordained num- ber of cell doublings is controlled by telomeres. Telomeres aresegments of DNA on the ends of chr omosomes, which are shortened during each round of DNA replication. Eventually when the telomeres are too short, the cell can nolonger divide and it undergoes apoptosis. By contrast, cancer cells have acquired the ability to main- tain the length of their telomeres, which means they canreplicate endlessly. Recent work has suggested that senes- cence can be induced pr ematur ely, particularly in premalig- nant cells, by activation of the normal, non-mutated forms of genes such as p53 and Rb. 111This senescence is a normal active process involving genetic and phenotypic changes that may protect against cancer development; for example, it maybe one mechanism pr eventing benign moles fr om pr ogress- ing to malignant melanoma. However, in malignant melanoma, cell markers of senescence are lost. 112 In experimental conditions, many constituents of food such as retinol, calcium, allyl sulphide, n-3 fatty acids, andgenistein ar eknown to influence progression of cells through the cell cycle. These studies, when conducted in cells in cultur e, need to be assessed cautiously because they may not always adequately reflect events in vivo. However, they can and do provide evidence additional to that gained fromepidemiological studies. Also see chapter 3.1 and 3.2. Specific dietary components have effects on cell cycle pro- gression and pr oliferation in experimental settings. Some known or hypothesised benefits of some dietar yconstituents are summarised here. Vitamin A (in the form of retinol) can lead to cell cycle arrest. 113Retinoids and car otenoids inhibit pr oliferation by binding retinoid receptors on the cell surface. Reduced expression of retinoid receptors occurs during developmentof lung cancer 114;retinoic acid receptor silencing is also com- mon in other malignancies. Retinoic acid, a metabolite of vit- amin A ,has been used as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent in cer vical cancer .115Retinoids can inhibit pr oliferation of initiated cells by inducing apoptosis or inducing differen- tiation of abnormal cells back to normal.116Retinoids may also cause r egression of pr ecancerous lesions in the cervix.117 43CHAPTER 2 THE CANCER PROCESS as histone the cell cycle. Folate is a necessar ycofactor for DNA synthesis, and deficiency can reduce cell pr oliferation due to decreased DNA synthesis. Phenolic compounds, including genistein and EGCG, can inhibit some cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases.118 Specifically, in people with oral leukoplakia, green tea (which contains EGCG) has been associated with significant decr eas- es in the size of cancers and of micronuclei formation in exfo- liated oral cells.119 Phytoestr ogens ar efound in high concentrations in soya beans, and have been shown in vitro to exhibit a plethora of different anti-cancer effects, including inhibiting prolifera-tion. 120 121Glucosinolates fr om crucifer ous vegetables ar econ- verted in the liver to ITCs, which can arrest cell cycle progression, as well as induce phase 2 enzymes, which canpromote carcinogen excretion (see 2.3). Only about one third of people have the types of microbial flora in their gut that arecapable of metabolising the dietary isoflavone daidzein to equol. with W estern populations, Asian popu - lations are more likely to produce equol, and this affects the expression of genes involved in cell signalling and differen-tiation ,and cell division .Equol can also modulate oestr ogen-responsive genes. 122 Calcium has a growth inhibiting action on normal and tumour gastrointestinalcells. 123However, certain dietary compounds can also stimulate proliferation in experimental cell lines, for example, colonic cells can beinduced to hyperproliferate bydietary haem iron. 124 In a variety of animal studies, certain dietary com- ponents have shown reduc-tions in experimentallyinduced cancers. Allyl sul-phides in garlic inhibit experimentally induced colon tumour formation.Although this is not com - pletely understood, experi- ments with diallyl disulphide suggest a block in the G 2/M phase in the progression ofthe cell cycle, and inductionof apoptosis. 125 Fish oil supplements decrease the number of tumours in experimental models of colorectal can- cer.126Long-chain n-3 P UFAs in fish oils can tumour cell proliferation30 31by modifying signalling path - ways,127 128 129 for example, by decreasing signalling of activated oncogenes.130Animals that receive a diet supple- mented with n-3 fatty acids have fewer colonic tumours thanthose fed a diet y pr otein expression in colonocytes during tumour development. Various growth factors and hormones involved in normal cell processes can be used or produced by cancer cells tomaintain or augment uncontr olled cell proliferation. The receptor for IGF-1 is overexpressed on many cancer cells. IGF-1 can enhance the gr owth of a variety of cancer cell lines 132by stimulating pr ogression of the cell cycle fr om G1 to S phase.13 Insulin itself can also act as a growth factor for tumour cell proliferation ,both by binding to the insulin r eceptor on can - cer cells and by stimulating increased IGF-1 production by the liver.13 133Insulin resistance increases with body fatness, in particular abdominal fatness, and the pancreas compensates by increasing insulin production. This hyperinsulinaemia is associated with a risk of cancers of the colon and endometri - um, and possibly of the pancr eas and kidney .13Leptin ,ahor- mone produced by fat cells, can also stimulate proliferation of many premalignant and malignant cell types,134as can a number of sex ster oid hormones (see Chapter 6, and bo x2.4). Nutrition may influence the r egulation of the nor mal cell cycle, which ensur es cor rect DNA replication. G0represents resting phase, G1the growth and preparation of the chromosomes for replication, S phase the synthesis of DNA, G2the preparation of the cell for division, and M represents mitosis. 44PART I BACKGROUND Physical activity impr oves insulin sensitivity and decr eas- es levels of insulin.135However, exercise has little or no long- term effects on cir culating IGF-1 levels.136-138IGF binding activity may increase with physical activity, and thus over- all IGF-1 bioavailability and activity ogen and andr ogens - menopausal women. In premenopausal women, it decreas- es circulating oestrogens, increases cycle length, anddecreases ovulation, all of which provide a protective effectfor breast and endometrial cancers. Also see Chapter 5. In experimental animals, ener gy restriction leads to a reduction in cell pr oliferation 66(box2.5). A tthe molecular level, dietar yenergy restriction affects levels of cell cycle con- trol proteins (decreased cyclins, increased levels of cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitors, and decreased cyclin-dependentkinases), leading to r educed Rb phosphorylation and inhib- ited cell cycle progression. 139This, in turn, may directly inhibit tumour gr owth and/or indir ectly reduce cancer devel- opment by r educing the number of cell divisions, thus r educ- ing the chances for incorrect DNA replication or preventing damaged DNA from being replicated. 2.5.2 Evasion of apoptosis Apoptosis is the tightly regulated process of cell death that controls cell numbers, removes damaged cells, and prevents damaged cells being replicated, thereby maintaining tissue integrity and pr otecting against cancer. Ultimately, cells br eak into small membrane-surr ounded fragments (apoptotic bodies) that are phagocytosed without inducing inflammation. Triggers for apoptosis in normal cells include DNA dam -age, disruption of the cell cycle, hypoxia, reactive oxy- gen species, and physical or chemical insult. Two non-exclusive pathways, the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway or the extrinsic (death-receptor) pathway, can be activated. Bothinvolve activation of caspas- es, a family of protease enzymes that cleave intra- cellular proteins. 143In functions as can also exert adirect apoptotic effect by damaging mitochondria. 144 Cancer cells have acquir ed mutations in genes regulat- ing apoptosis and ther efore can evade apoptotic signals. in apoptosis areoften in establishedcancers. In cancer cells,many signals that normallyinduce apoptosis, such as damaged DNA or expr ession of activated oncogenes, ar epre- sent but apoptosis is not induced. This avoidance of apop- tosis allows further opportunity for additional mutations to develop. In cancer cells with mutations in p53 or other members of this family, apoptosis may not occur.Additionally ,mutations in genes that would normally activate p53 or regulate its activity, or in genes that should be switched on as a result of p53 activation, can have thesame effect. Cancer cells with upregulated expression ofIGF-1R and increased responses to IGF-1 have decreasedapoptosis. 133 In experimental settings, ener gy restriction creates a pro- apoptotic envir onment, adjacent to pr emalignant and malignant breast pathologies.145Long-chain n-3 PUFAs in fish oils limit tumour cell proliferation, increasing apoptot-ic potential along the cr ypt axis, promoting differentiation and limiting angiogenesis. 30 31 126 Reactive o xygen species can induce apoptosis, but it is also possible that scavenging of r eactive o xygen species by dietary antioxidants can delay or inhibit apoptosis, and thus favour survival of premalignant cells. Indeed, this couldexplain why dietar yantio xidant inter vention trials have pr o- duced mixed results. 146 147 Many dietary components have been shown to induce apoptosis in cultured cancer cells and in experimental mod- Cancer cells have dif ferent characteristics fr om nor mal cells. The six 'hallmarks' shown her earethe phenotypic changes that need to be accumulated over time as a result of genetic changes (mutations and epigenetic factors) in order for a cell to become cancerous. Maintenance of healthy cells depends on regulated processes, which can be influenced by factors related to food, nutrition, and physical activity ,either to pr otect the cell fr om or to promote cancer. The evidence for what is shown here comes from a variety of experimental studies. 45CHAPTER 2 THE CANCER PROCESS 46PART I BACKGROUND els of cancer .148These apoptosis.150 Alpha-tocopherol (a form of vitamin E) has been shown both to induce151and to protect against apoptosis.152 2.5.3 Sustained angiogenesis Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essen- tial for the supply of nutrients and o xygen to any gr owing tissue, including tumours. Most cells within tissues reside within 100 mm of a capillary blood vessel. The generationof blood vessels in adults is fairly constant and tightlycontrolled by a balance of angiogenesis inducers andinhibitors. For a cancer to progress to a larger size, it mustacquire the ability to induce angiogenesis. Currently about35 proteins have been identified as angiogenesis activatorsor inhibitors. 153 In experimental settings, one of the first dietar ycompo - nents for which a beneficial anti-angiogenic effect wasclearly demonstrated was EGCG from green tea. 154Now some 20 different compounds consisting mainly of flavonoidsand isoflavones (including genistein) ar edocumented as being able to modulate the angiogenic process. Diets high in n-6 fatty acids ar eassociated with poor pr ognosis in breast cancer patients, wher eas those high in n-3 fatty acids appear to suppress angiogenesis. 155Long-chain n-3 PUFAs in fish oils limit angiogenesis in other experimental cancers.3031 Curcumin ,quercetin ,and resveratrol have all been shown to inhibit the angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in cultured cancer cells. Garlic extract mayinhibit experimentally induced angiogenesis, as it can sup- press endothelial motility, proliferation, and tube for- mation . 156Phytoestr ogens found in high concentrations in soya beans have also been shown to inhibit angiogenesis.120 Energy restriction reduces blood vessel density in pre- malignant and malignant breast pathologies.145Exercise increases the levels of a cir culating endogenous VEGF-inhibitor in healthy people, which could decr ease plasma levels of VEGF .157 2.5.4 Tissue invasion and metastasis Normal cells in solid tissues maintain their position in the body and generally do not migrate. As a cancer increases, iteventually r eaches the membrane encapsulating the organ. Tumour cells secr ete enzymes such as matrix metallopro- teases (MMPs), which digest the membrane and allow the cancer to invade adjacent tissue. Once thr ough the mem - brane, cancer cells can access other sites via the blood and lymphatic systems. This migration of cancer cells, or metas-tasis, is a common characteristic of most cancer deaths. There is limited evidence for dietary components to influ- ence these late stages of cancer, although in vitro, EGCG,resveratrol, quercetin, curcumin, and genistein can inhibitone or C can inhibit MMP productionby a number of human cancer cell lines and pr event inva- sion of these lines in vitr o .158Vitamin E can inhibit metas - tasis of pr e-established tumours in mouse models of br east cancer.159 2.6 Conclusions Great pr ogress has been made since the mid-1990s in the understanding of the cancer process. Evidence is accum- ulating that shows or suggests that food and nutrition, andphysical activity and associated factors, ar eimportant in modification of the cancer process. Moreover, there is increased evidence that specific dietary patterns, foods anddrinks, and dietary constituents can and do protect against cancer, not only before the process starts, but also after- wards. Understanding the mechanisms that contr ol cell structur e and function, and so influence the cancer process, will aid not only understanding of cancer as a whole, but also thedevelopment of pr eventive strategies. Restriction of energy intake from food is the most effective single intervention for preventing cancer in experimental animals.It increases the lifespan of rodents, and suppresses tumour development in mice. In addition, energy restriction can suppressthe pro-cancer effects of many carcinogens in experimental animal models. 66 Energy restriction leads to a reduction in cell proliferation.66This may directly inhib- ittumour growth, and also indirectly reduce cancer development by reducing overall proliferation, thus reducing the chances for incorrect DNA replication, or bypreventing damaged DNA from being replicated. Reduced metabolism results in reduced generation of reactive oxygenspecies, and therefore less exposure of DNA todamaging oxygen radicals. Dietary energy restriction reduces levels of circulating IGF-166 140and insulin, which are growth factors for many cells, includ- ing breast cancer.141IGF-1 stimulates pro- gression through the cell cycle from G1to Sphase, and high levels of insulin increase production of IGF-1.13Energy restriction also decreases expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and increases levels and inhib- ited progression.139Energy restric- tion also decreases other inflammatory markers.66Conversely, increased glucose levels associated with increased energyintake are associated with increased DNA synthesis and levels of some cyclins and CDKs.113Energy restriction may also create apro-apoptotic environment and reduce blood vessel density, as shown in pre- malignant and malignant breast path-ologies. 139It may also activate other protective pathways, such as the activation of protein deacetylases.142 The data on energy restriction must be interpreted with caution, as all studies have been performed in experimental ani- mals and there is an absence of epidemio- logical and mechanistic data in humans. Therefore the relevance of these findings inexperimental animals to the human condition is not yet clear.Box 2.5 Energy restriction48PART I BACKGROUND Judging the evidence The task of expert committees responsible for reports such as this is to collect, discuss, and judgescientific evidence, as a basis for recommendationsmade in the public interest. The purpose of this third introductory chapter is to summarise the process the Panel has used in the five years of its work, in orderto ensur ethat its assessments, judgements, and recommendations made in the chapters that followarereliable. As shown in the previous chapters, while cancer is adisease of cells and tissues, the main determinants of many cancers are environmental, which meansthat most cancers are, at least in theory,preventable. Environmental factors that modify therisk of cancer include food and nutrition, physicalactivity ,and body composition. One purpose of scientific research in this field is to determine whichaspects of these factors pr otect against, and which are causes of, cancers of various sites. Such researchis also concerned with which aspects are mostimpor tant \u2014 that is, which have the most power ful or general effects. Some of the methods used by the Panel responsible for this Report are new. Others aredeveloped from those used elsewhere, including inthe pr evious report. The best evidence that aspects of food, nutrition, physical activity ,and body fatness can modify the risk of cancer does not come fr om any one type of scientific investigation. It comes from a combination of different types ofepidemiological and other studies, suppor ted by evidence of plausible biological mechanisms. Such compr ehensive evidence has been collected in the formof 20 systematic literatur ereviews specially commissioned as the basis for this Report, compiled by nine independent centres of scientific excellence, covering 20 cancer sites, the deter minants of obesity, and recommendations made by other authoritative reports. These reviews amount to a comprehensive examination of the relevant types ofepidemiological and experimental evidence,organised using a common methodology. Their findings, as summarised for and then assessed andjudged by the Panel, are shown in Part 2 of thisReport. The full systematic literature reviews arecontained on the CD included with this Repor t. CHAPTER 3 Judgements of the Panel are shown in the form of matrices at the beginning of the chapters of Part 2 ofthis Report. Two key judgements in these matrices,and in the text, are those of 'convincing' and 'probable'. These denote the Panel's judgements that the evidence of causality \u2014 that a factor eitherdecreases or incr eases the risk of cancer \u2014 is str ong enough to justify population goals and personal recommendations, which ar emade in Par t3. The criteria agreed by the Panel for grading the evidence 'convincing', 'probable', or 'limited', or else showingthat any substantial effect on the risk of cancer isunlikely, are also specified in this chapter. 49CHAPTER 3 JUDGING THE EVIDENCE Since the mid-1990s, the discipline of epidemiology has placed increasing emphasis on the use of meta-analyses andsystematic reviews, both of which have informed the Panelresponsible for this Report. Taken together with lines of evi- dence from other types of study, these provide a reliable basis for judgements and recommendations designed to improvepublic health. Thetask of the Panel, with the supporting Secretariat, has been to commission ,summarise, and display a compr ehensive range of evidence; to assess and judge this evidence; and to draw conclusions and make recommendations based on thissystematic and transparent process. Also see Appendix A. This chapter details the nature of the science relevant to the work of the Panel. It also summarises the processes devel-oped fr om initial work done by a Methodology Task Force. Its findings have been a foundation for the work of the P anel. The two most important parts of this process are the sys- tematic literatur ereviews (SLRs), explained in bo x3.4, and the criteria the Panel has agreed for grading the evidence, described in box 3.8. These and other methods have deter-mined the P anel's appr oach to gathering, summarising, assessing, and judging evidence, and agreeing on population goals and personal recommendations as a basis for the pre-vention of cancer. 3.1 Epidemiological evidence Epidemiological research describes and seeks to explain the distribution of health and disease within human populations.The methods used ar ebased mainly on comparative obser- vations made at the level of whole populations, special groups (such as migrants), or individuals within populations. This type of investigation is known as obser vational. By r elat- ing differences in circumstances and behaviour to differences in the incidence of disease, associations are identified thatmay be causal. In epidemiological studies, an 'exposur e' is a factor or condition that may increase or decrease the risk of disease. In this Report, food, nutrition, physical activity, andbody composition are the 'exposures' investigated. The meth- ods summarised here and applied to cancer are also used to study and understand other diseases. 3.1.1 Descriptive studies The most basic information about cancer comes from sta- tistics on cancer incidence and mortality .See chapter 1.2.4,the introductory passages of the sections of Chapter 7, and box 7.1.1. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), abranch of the World Health Organization, compiles inter- national cancer statistics using data from national and regional cancer registries around the world.1Cancer inci- dence rates ar eusually specified by gender and age. Cancer mortality rates, generally derived from data collected rou- tinely on causes of death, ar emorewidely available than cancer incidence rates. Descriptive epidemiology informs cancer surveillance programmes, and is a basic tool for determining patterns of cancer, relative rates of cancer and other diseases, andchanges in patterns and trends over time. Remarkablechanges in the incidence of cancers (for example, the general dr op in rates of stomach cancer or the incr ease in rates of lung cancer in many middle- and low-income countries) pr ovide first lines of evidence pointing to causa - tion due to corresponding changes in environmental circumstances. Likeall types of study ,descriptive epidemiology has limi - tations. Apparent trends in cancer incidence and mortality may be due in part to changes and developments in screen-ing, diagnosis, or treatment. For example, the rapid rise inthe recorded incidence of prostate cancer in the USA, the UK,and other higher -income countries is largely due to wide- spread use of diagnostic techniques that identify early evidence of this cancer . 3.1.2 Ecological studies Ecological studies ar edesigned to explore relationships between environmental factors and disease amongst popu- lations rather than individuals. Within the scope of this R eport, ecological studies compar e relationships between estimated levels of consumption of foods and drinks, levels of physical activity, and degrees ofbody fatness with rates of cancer for populations. F or exam - ple, as already mentioned, early observations found impres- sive correlations between national per capita intake of totaldietary fat and rates of breast cancer mortality, mapped across many countries, 2leading to the hypothesis that rela- tively high consumption of total fat was an important causeof breast cancer . The findings of ecological studies, together with those from migrant and laboratory studies (see 3.1.3 and 3.2), wereimportant factors leading to judgements and r ecom -50PART I BACKGROUND mendations made in reports on diet and cancer published in the 1980s.3-5 While ecological studies, lik eother observational studies, may suggest a r elationship between a specific envir onmen- tal factor (such as an aspect of food and nutrition) anddisease, the actual causal relationship may be with a differ- ent 'confounding' factor, which may or may not be associat-ed with the envir onmental factor being investigated. 6The example of total fat consumption and breast cancer is a case in point: total fat consumption ,disposable income, and con - sumption of alcoholic drinks might all corr elate with one another, and also with breast cancer. See box 3.1. Ecological studies are often used to identify associations or trends that warrant further investigation .They have spe - cial strengths, particularly when conducted between popu- lations, either internationally, or cross-culturally amongdifferent populations within a country. Thus, the contrast in dietary intake between countries is often much larger than the contrast within countries. In addition ,average national diets ar elikely to be mor estable over time than the diets of communities, families, or individual people. For most coun- tries, the changes in overall national dietary intakes over adecade or two ar erelatively small.3.1.3 Migrant studies Migrant studies compare cancer rates for migrants, and for their offspring, in their curr ent country of residence, with rates in their countr yof origin .16These studies show that populations migrating between ar eas with differ ent cancer incidence rates acquire the rates characteristic of their new location for some cancers, often after only one or two gen-erations. This shows that envir onmental, rather than inher- ited, factors are primarily responsible for the large differences in cancer rates in differ ent regions and countries (see chap- ter 1.3). 17Those diseases for which incidence shifts with migration, such as cancer, are diseases with evidently impor- tant environmental causes. 3.1.4 Case-control studies In case-control studies, individuals diagnosed with a specif- ic type of cancer ('cases') are compared with otherwise sim- ilar individuals who have not been diagnosed with cancer ('contr ols'). The control group is a sample of the population from which the cases ar ose, and pr ovides an estimate of how the exposures being studied are distributed in that popula- tion. Identifying and enrolling appropriate controls is a majorchallenge in case-contr ol studies. 18-20Interpretation of epidemiological evidence onany and all aspects of foods and drinks, physical activity, body composition, and associated factors, with the risk of cancer, is never simple. General considerations include the following, which need to be taken into account when evidence is assem-bled and assessed. This emphasises that expert judgement is essential. Patterns and ranges of intakes. Most stud- ies are carried out in high-income countries. Their findings may have limited applicationin countries where dietary and physical activity patterns are different. They may also be unrevealing in their own countriesif the ranges examined are relatively nar- row. Some foods that are important dietary constituents outside high-income countries areoften not examined. Classification. Following from the above, studies usually classify foods and drinks,and physical activity in ways that cor re- spond to the patterns of high-income coun- tries. Their findings may over-emphasisethe significance (or insignificance) of foods and drinks commonly consumed in high- income countries, and they may overlookother foods and drinks consumed in other parts of the world. The same points apply to types of physical activity. This may impede understanding, not only inmiddle- and low-income countries, but also globally. Measurement .Many study exposures are difficult to determine and are thus mea- sured imprecisely. It is easier to measure food intakes than intakes of dietary con-stituents of foods. This can lead to an undue degree of importance being given to studies of aspects of food and nutritionthat happen to be more easily measured. Terminology. For some foods and drinks, and dietary constituents, there are no gen- erally agreed definitions. Examples include 'dietary fibre' and 'processed meat'. Also,some common definitions may disguise real differences: different types of 'dietary fibre' have different biological effects. Study design .The r elative merits of dif fer- ent types of epidemiological study design, and the relative value of epidemiologicalevidence compar ed with experimental evi - dence, are likely to remain to some extent amatter of opinion. The special power of randomised controlled trials (see 3.1.6), most often used to test the effects of dietar yconstituents as opposed to whole diets, could lead to over -emphasis of the importance of isolated constituents which, within the context of food and diets, mayhave other ef fects. Confounding .Aconfounder is a factor associated with both the outcome (in thiscase, cancer) and the exposure being stud- ied, but is not an effect of the exposure. It is never possible from observational studies to eliminate completely the possibility that an evident effect of a constituent, or aspectof a food or drink, is at least in part caused by another factor. Reporting bias. Studies reliant on self- reporting of dietary intake are prone to sys- tematic bias. People tend to over-reportconsumption of foods and drinks they believe to be healthy, and under-report foods and drinks they believe to beunhealthy. Under-reporting of energy intake has been shown to be associated with factors such as age, overweight and obesity ,perceived body size, and other per - sonal characteristics. 7-14Allowance for this is an inexact science. Also see 3.3. Production, pr eservation, pr ocessing, preparation. Studies of foods and drinks, and of food groups, may neglect theeffects of methods of production, preser- vation, processing, and preparation (includ- ing cooking). They ar ealso inclined to under estimate the significance of foods and drinks combined in dishes or meals, and as components of whole dietarypatter ns.Box 3.1 Issues concerning interpretation of the evidence51CHAPTER 3 JUDGING THE EVIDENCE Case-control studies are subject to recall bias, which can occur when participants' reporting of various exposures (dietary intake, medication, physical activity, and so on) is differentially affected by whether they are cases or controlsin the study. Selection bias is an increasing problem in high- income countries, where participation rates among both case and control groups may be substantially less than 100 per cent, and where participation may be related (in different ways) to various exposures. However, case-control studiesare usually less expensive than cohort studies, and can be completed over shorter periods of time. A'nested' case-control study is carried out within an exist- ing cohort study (see 3.1.5). In this type of study, all of the cases in the cohort are compared with a sample of the non-cases. A nested case-control study has the strengths of acohort study \u2014 notably that diet is assessed among studyparticipants prior to the diagnosis of cancer, so avoiding recall bias \u2014 but is less expensive to conduct, since only a sample of the non-cases are included in the analysis. 3.1.5 Cohort studies In pr ospective cohort studies (usually simply called cohort studies), the diets, body compositions, and/or physical activ- ity levels of a large group (cohort) of people who areassumed to be healthy are assessed, and the group is fol-lowed over a period of time. During the follow-up period,some members of the cohort will develop and be diagnosedwith cancer ,while others will not, and comparisons are then made between these two gr oups. Because measur e- ments are made before any cancer diagnosis, cohort studies arenot subject to r ecall bias. A single cohort study allows examination of the effects of diet and physical activity on multiple types of cancer and other diseases. Also, in cohortstudies, blood and tissue samples ar eoften collected and stored for future analysis. Finally, cohort studies provide the opportunity to obtain repeated assessments of participants'diets at regular intervals, which may improve the dietaryassessment. Cohort studies may need to be ver ylarge (up to tens or even hundr eds of thousands of participants) to have sufficient statistical power to identify factors that mayincrease cancer risk by as little as 20 or 30 per cent. Also, meaningful comparisons between cases and non-cases canbemade only for factors that var ysufficiently within the cohort. Cohort studies ar eexpensive, so they have been conduct - ed mostly in high-income countries. The Eur opean Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), started in 1992, is a cohort of more than 520000 men andwomen in 10 Eur opean countries. 21 22In the US, lar ge cohorts include the Nurses' Health Study, established in 1976, and the Nurses' Health Study II, established in 1989, each with acohort of more than 100000 women. 23-25Increasing numbers of cohort studies are now being conducted in middle- and low-income countries. 3.1.6 Randomised controlled trials Arandomised controlled trial (RCT) is an experiment in which participants ar erandomly assigned to gr oups, oftencalled intervention and control groups, to receive or not receive an experimental intervention. The main use of RCTs has generally been to test the efficacy of drugs and other medical treatments. In a 'double blind' RCT , neither the participants nor the investigators know to which group (intervention or control) the participant has been assigned. Blinding is used because the knowledge of group assignment might influence study results, but it is usually impossible to achieve with trialsinvolving physical activity, or those investigating foods and drinks in their usual form. An effective use of RCTs is to test the effects of supple- mentation with specified doses of dietary micronutrients (as pills or by other means). However, pharmacological dosesof supplements are often studied \u2014 doses much higher than can be derived from diets \u2014 and results may not bedirectly relevant to dietary intakes of that micronutrient. Such trials may yield powerful evidence of the effect of a specific dietary constituent. However, they are often con-ducted as a r esult of pr omising epidemiological studies that have shown protective effects of a particular group of foods, and ther eis always a possibility that the actual active agent or combination of agents in the foods has not been used in the trial. Dietary constituents that are or may beprotective when contained within foods may have unex-pected effects in isolation, especially at doses higher thanthose found in normal diets. For example, in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Trial (ATBC Trial) of male smok ers in Finland, high dose beta-carotene supplementation was associated with increased incidence of lung cancer . 26 RCTs are also used to test interventions designed to change behaviour, including dietary intakes and physical activity.Such trials r equir eahigh level of commitment by partici - pants, and learning how to conduct them well is a topic of active investigation. Aunique and important strength of sufficiently large RCTs is that confounding variables, both known and unknown,will on average be distributed equally between the tr eatment and contr ol gr oups, and will therefore not bias the study results. 3.1.7 Meta-analysis Meta-analysis is a method used to combine the r esults of sev- eral studies addressing similar questions. Unless an epi- demiological study is sufficiently lar ge, modest but potentially important associations can be missed, simplybecause of the inadequate statistical power of the individual study. Meta-analysis is used to provide summaries of select-ed collections of studies. Study-level meta-analysis provides single estimates of effect using information from multiple studies of the samedesign. These summary estimates can provide evidence regarding the presence or absence of an association, as well as examining possible dose-r esponse relationships (box 3.2). Meta-analysis, often displayed graphically on a for est plot (box 3.3), can also identify heterogeneity between studies. This heterogeneity can be quantified using a measure calledI 2,which ranges fr om 0 to 100 per cent, and indicates the52PART I BACKGROUND percentage of total variation across studies that is not due to chance. In general, an I2of 25 per cent or less indicates low heter ogeneity ;around 50 per cent indicates moderate heterogeneity; and 75 per cent or more indicates high heter ogeneity .27 For this Report, RCTs and ecological, cohort, and case-con- trol studies have been the subjects of systematic review, and,when possible (and separately) of study-level meta-analysis.Studies were included in a meta-analysis only when suffi-cient data were included in the publication. In addition toeffect measures and their standard errors (or confidenceintervals, see box 3.3), key elements of adequate reportingincluded the number of people with and without disease for each exposur ecategor y, and boundaries of exposure categories. The SLRs on which the conclusions of this Report are based include original study-level meta-analysesundertak en by the independent centres of scientific excel- lence. The Panel considered all studies identified in the SLR, not just the r esults of the meta-analyses. F ull details of the methods used for the meta-analyses ar econtained in the SLR specification manual. The full SLRs and the manu- al are contained on the CD included with this Report. Alsosee bo x3.4. Pooled analysis is a type of meta-analysis where original individual-level data from various published epidemiologi-cal studies of the same type \u2014 usually prospective cohort studies \u2014 are combined and reanalysed. The combination of data fr om multiple studies creates a larger data set and increased statistical power .Published studies fr om pooling projects, in addition to the SLR study-level results generat- ed specifically for this Report, were taken into account by thePanel in making its assessments and judgements.3.2 Experimental evidence Epidemiological studies all have str engths and limitations. So do laboratory and mechanistic studies; their main strength is contr ol. The envir onment of these r esear ch studies is defined by chosen experimental conditions: precise manipulations can be made and relatively exact measures taken. Occasionallythe test participant is a human volunteer ,but usually these studies are conducted in animals (in vivo) or using human or animal cells grown in the laboratory (in vitro). Rodents (usually rats or mice) are the most commonly used animals in laboratory experiments. Their relatively short life-span pr ovides comparatively fast results in cancer studies, and they offer a ' whole body system' suited to a wide variety of tests. R odent studies can show how nutrients and other com - pounds might affect the cancer process. But it is known that some interventions that affect rodents do not affect humans,or do not affect them in the same ways or to the same degr ees, and vice versa. Also, experiments on animals may be highly artificial, using special br eeds of r odents initially given mas- sive doses of car cinogenic agents, and then fed nutrients or other substances at levels far higher than humans would nor- mally consume, or could ethically be given. Human or animal cells, sometimes derived fr om particu - lar cancers, can be grown in vitro in the laboratory and used in experiments to help researchers understand mechanismsthat may lead to the development of cancer. The Panel's deci- sion on what types of experimental studies were admissible as evidence for this R eport is summarised in box 3.5. 3.2.1 Human feeding studies Human volunteers can be studied in a controlled environ- ment, such as within a metabolic unit, wher etheir diets and'Dose response' is from pharmacology, where it denotes a changein the effect of a drug according to the dose used. This concept can be applied to any exposure, including food, nutrition, and physical activity. For example, different amounts of food and drink consumed, orof physical activity taken, may lead to a dif- ferent likelihood of any particular out- come, such as cancer. Such a gradedresponse, or biological gradient, may show that higher exposure leads to increased risk, or to reduced risk, and vice versa. Dose responses take different forms. The effect may be linear, shown in graphic form as a straight line. Ther emay be a 'thresh- old' below which there is no effect, but above which there is an effect. This is shown as a horizontal line that inclines once the thr eshold is r eached. Or the ef fect may be to influence risk one way at bothlow and high levels of exposure, but the other way at intermediate levels of expo-sure, shown as 'J'- or 'U'-shaped curves. In such cases, the exposure is evidently beneficial or harmful only within certain ranges. Throughout Chapters 4-6, this Report uses two forms of dose-response graph as ameans of displaying graded responses. These show the direction and shape of theassociation, and allow estimates to be made of levels of exposure that may influ- ence risk. In order to combine and quanti-fy study results, the dose-response curves are also presented with the exposure vari- able displayed per standar dunit of increase. The demonstration of a biologi- cal gradient adds weight to evidence that an exposure may be causal. Diet and phys- ical activity exposur esarecontinuous vari - ables, but ar eoften reported in discretecategories. Although this is done for sta- tistical reasons and can make effects easi-er to detect, the number and location of category boundaries may obscure the true relationship between exposure and the outcome, and non-linear effects of expo- sure may be missed if insufficient cate-gories are used. Evidence of dose response is important when framing recommendations. Forexample, if the evidence for cancer showed no threshold of effect for alcoholic drinks, such that the risk of cancer increased fromhaving any amount of alcoholic drink, however modest, then a recommendation based on the evidence for cancer would beto avoid alcoholic drinks. However, if there is clear evidence of no effect below a cer- tain level of consumption, then the rec- ommendation would dif fer accor dingly . Also see chapter 4.8. Box 3.2 Dose response53CHAPTER 3 JUDGING THE EVIDENCE activity levels can be highly regulated and measured. In some studies, subjects live at the metabolic unit for short periods oftime, eating only foods and meals provided as part of the study .Since the nutrient composition of such diets can be contr olled and manipulated, investigators can study the effects of various changes in nutrient intakes on factors such as hormone levels or cell proliferation assays, which may beimportant pr edictors of cancer or other diseases. These ar e intermediate markers, however, and relating the results to cancer occurrence may be problematic. 3.2.2 Live animal models Laborator yanimals can be used to test the effects of food, nutrition ,and physical activity on the development of can - cer. Human genes can be added to animals' DNA (creating transgenic animal models) or key genes can be removed (cre-ating 'knock out' animal models) to addr ess specific r esearchquestions. Often the animals have tumours produced by irra- diation ,viruses, chemicals, or other carcinogens, or they may be genetically prone to develop cancer. The effect of dietary or other inter ventions on the pr evention or progression of such tumours is then investigated. As indicated in 3.2, the strength of these studies is the tight control of experimental conditions. Their limitations aretheir artificiality and the fact that no effect on r odents, how - ever unequivocal, can be assumed to apply to humans. Rather like the results of population ecological studies,results from animal studies provide first lines of evidence that may prompt more persuasive research; they can also cor- roborate such findings. 3.2.3 In vitro studies In vitro studies are conducted using cells or other test sys- tems. Human cells, animal cells, mechanistic test systems,The graphic device known as a 'forest plot' is the usual method of presenting the results of meta-analysis of a num- ber of studies. In the forest plot below,studies are presented that examine the relationship between alcoholic drinksand oesophageal cancer. This plot is also shown as figure 4.8.5. This plot shows 1 cohort study and 23 estimates from 20 case-control stud- ies. The horizontal axis of the plotshows the relative risk (RR) and is bisected by the vertical axis, which rep- resents 'no difference in effect on risk'between the exposure categories that are compared (the RR is 1.00). Also see 3.4.3. The squares represent the results of each individual study. Each square is centred on the point estimate of the RR for that study .The point estimate is the extent to which any exposur e(in this case, alcoholic drinks) is associated with the risk of cancer (in this case, ofthe oesophagus). The line r unning through the squares represents the 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) of theestimate. Where no line is apparent,the CI falls within the square. The CI isan indication of how much randomerror underlies the point estimate; it does not take into account confound- ing and other forms of systematic bias. 15A confidence level of 95 per cent indicates a 95 per cent probability that the true pop- ulation value falls within the CI.28 When the CI does not cross the vertical axis representing 'no difference', the esti- mate is considered statistically significant.Looking at the example above, the valueof meta-analysis is demonstrated: of the 20 case-contr ol studies, 6 ar enon-signifi - cant or only marginally so, of which 1 sug- gests a protective effect (that is, it has anRR of less than 1.00). But taken together , as shown by the summary diamond, an overall significant effect, consistent with ajudgement that alcoholic drinks are acause of oesophageal cancer ,is shown.There is only one cohort study shown onthe forest plot, and it has a wide CI, but the estimate is statistically signifi- cant and consistent with results fromthe case-control studies. The size of each square on the plot represents each study's calculated weight (influence) on the combined(summary) estimate (the diamond). The size of the square is calculated taking anumber of factors into account, such as the number of people in the study, and the event rate (here, the rate of oesophageal cancer occurrence). Thediamond summarises the meta-analysis. The width of the diamond represents the 95 per cent CI of the overallestimate. Unless indicated otherwise, random effects models, which do not assume that the links between exposure and outcome ar ethe same in dif ferent studies, wer eused to generate the forest plots presented in this Report. The Panel's judgement for this particu-lar example is given in chapter 4.8.5. The forest plots presented in this Reportdo not contain all of the studies identi-fied in the SLRs. Sometimes, more stud-ies could be included in a comparisonbetween those at the highest levelscompar ed with the lowest levels of exposure in different studies. This can give an indication as to whether or notthereis an association between exposur e and outcome. However, because the actu- al levels of exposur evarybetween studies, this cannot give a quantified summaryestimate of effect. The Panel discussed all studies identified, not just those includedin a meta-analysis.

Cell cultures can be primary, where tissue (such as a tumour biopsy) is taken directly from humans or animals andthen or tured a number of times. Such cell lines are commonly used in laboratory research, and can become immortal \u2014 culturedagain and again. The cells or tissues are subjected to poten- tial carcinogens, and then markers of damage are measured. Conducting studies in vitro has two main advantages. First, specific, well defined inter ventions can be tested; and second, intracellular mechanisms can be examined. However, these studies do not allow the study of integrated systems,such as how or gans or the whole body r esponds to theinterventions. Ther eforeextrapolation of r esults to humans is limited. 3.2.4 Biological pathways Epidemiological and experimental evidence indicating a causal association between an aspect of diet and cancer isstrengthened when there is evidence of a plausible biologi- cal pathway or mechanism by which the cancer process may be modified. The P anel agreed that simply identifying such plausible mechanisms is not sufficient evidence for a causal relationship; but it also agreed that the case for a causal rela- tionship is strengthened when there is evidence of biologi-cal plausibility .The main basis for the Panel's work in com- ing to judgement on the causal relation- ships between food, nutrition, physical activity, and cancer is a series of 20 speciallycommissioned systematic literature reviews (SLRs). These have all been conductedaccording to a common, detailed specifi- cation, following recommendations madeby the Methodology Task Force, which completed its work before the Panel's first meeting. The SLRs form the main evidencebasis for the assessments and judgements made by the Panel in Part 2 of this Report, onwhich the Panel's population goals and personal recommendations in Part 3 are based. This approach differs from that used to prepare most other expert reports. Previously, expert reports concerned with the prevention of disease, and other top- ics, have r elied on less for mal methods to collect and assess r elevant literatur e. Until the 1980s, most such reports were assem- bled by members of panels of scientistswho, assisted by secr etariats, wr ote drafts of chapters themselves using their own knowledge, either with or without addi-tional research. The panel then reviewedthe draft report until consensus wasachieved. In some cases, r eport authors took total r esponsibility for assembling and judging the evidence. In the 1990s, more ambitious reports placed greater emphasison secr etariats, which tended to take mor e responsibility for drafting the report, and for some original r esear ch, as dir ected by the panel. More recently, panels havesometimes been informed by 'narrative reviews' commissioned from specialists andprepared independently from the panel process. Such reviews are usually written from the specialists' existing knowledge, and for mbackground 'substrate' for the reports. Narrative reviews may be pub-lished separately. 29Current practice, when resources allow, isto separate the process of collecting and displaying evidence from that of discussing and judging evidence. Evidence is collect-edsystematically, after agreeing criteria for inclusion or exclusion for review. As well asreducing possible bias, this is a more com- prehensive and transparent approach. Thisprocess was used by the previous report, which at the time of its publication was the most comprehensive in its and allied fields.This current Report has made a step- change in this process, by commissioning independent SLRs, and making full use ofelectronic resources. The Panel, in commissioning the SLRs and supplementary work, decided torequire evidence from all relevant epi- demiological and experimental studies, together with biological findings. The alter native appr oach would have been to agree a hierar chy of epidemiological evi - dence, perhaps with one study type given pre-eminent importance. Instead, whileallowing for some types of epidemiologi - cal study being more or less prone to bias than others, the Panel has based its con-clusions and judgements on evidence accu-mulated from different types of study. Forthe Panel to be convinced that a r elation- ship between an exposur eand cancer is causal, or that it is probably causal, consis- tent evidence from different types of studywas r equir ed, with the exception of ran- domised controlled trials. The teams r esponsible for pr oducing the SLRs gathered relevant studies in a com-mon, systematic fashion, using a protocol designed to limit the potential for bias indeciding which evidence should be includ- ed or excluded from analysis. The first stage of the SLRs was a com - prehensive search of the scientific literature and other sources catalogued on electron-ic databases, using all relevant keywordsand terms. The papers identified were assessed for relevance using reproducible criteria. Study characteristics and results were extracted and recorded. Data fromdifferent studies were combined and analysed, using meta-analysis when appro-priate. Key features of selected studies are presented in graphic form in Chapters 4-6and 8, to aid comparison and quality assess- ment. Existing SLRs were also identified to ensure, as far as possible, that all relevantpapers were included. An important aspect of an SLR is that all stages of searching, selection, assessment,and analysis are prespecified, objective, reproducible, openly documented, and subject to peer review at critical stages. Asstated, full details of the approach taken can be found in the SLR specification man- ual contained on the CD included with this Repor t(together with the SLRs). The SLRs included evidence published up to the end of 2005, and the Panel's con-clusions are based on these SLRs. To ensurethat the Panel' srecommendations, which are derived from their conclusions and judgements, take into account developingevidence, a further review of studies pub-lished during 2006 was conducted. Thisreview was more limited than the full SLRs: it was confined to exposur es that had been judged 'convincing', 'probable', 'sub- stantial effect on risk unlikely', and 'limit-ed-suggestive', based on the SLRs. (See box 3.8 for an explanation of these terms.) At this second r eview stage, no fur ther meta- analyses were performed and a review ofstudy quality was not included. For these reasons, the results of this 2006 reviewhave been noted but have not been used to alter the Panel's judgements based on the full SLRs. A fur ther pr ocess has been established for a continuous r eview of evidence published since 2006, after pub-lication of this Report.Box 3.4 Systematic literature reviews55CHAPTER 3 JUDGING THE EVIDENCE Narrative reviews of experimental studies and of evidence of plausible biological mechanisms were included in the SLRs that inform this Report. Summaries of these SLRs are pre- sented in Part 2, Chapters 4-10. Also see box 3.4. 3.3 Methods of assessment Some exposures are easier to measure than others. Thus, it is relatively easy to assess the impact of tobacco smoking and exposure to tobacco on cancer risk. Although tobacco smoke is a mixture of many chemicals, and its interactions with the body are complex, tobacco can be considered a single exposure. By contrast, diets are multidimensional exposures and in free-living populations cannot be measured with completeaccuracy. Moreover, the foods and drinks people consume every day contain thousands of constituents, some well known, others unknown and unmeasured. The relationshipsbetween food, nutrition ,physical activity ,and health and dis - ease are complex and difficult to untangle. The presence or absence of effect modification (bo x3.6) can cr eate additional challenges. 3.3.1 Foods, drinks, and nutrients People's dietary intake varies from day to day and over the course of their lives. There are interrelationships betweenfood components, between foods in whole diets, andbetween diets and other behavioural characteristics such asphysical activity or smoking. There are several methods forassessing food and drink consumption ,all with their own weaknesses and strengths. 3.3.1.1 Dietar yassessment methods Food intakes can be measured for populations, groups, or individuals. The most commonly used techniques for assess-ing food and drink consumption are diet histories, 24-hourdietary recalls, food frequency questionnaires, and food diary or food record methods. Most of the studies included in this Report used dietary assessment data from individuals, recorded using food frequency questionnaires. Diet histories take the form of unstructured enquiries, more useful in clinical settings than in research studies. Dietary recalls may use structured or unstructured methods, and are often administered many times over the course of a study. In a 24-hour dietary recall, a record is made of every-thing a person can recall eating or drinking over the previ- ous24 hours. Automated systems for collecting and analysing dietary recalls have been developed, which facil- itate the use of this method of assessment in large studies. 32 Food frequency questionnaires collect information on food consumption patterns, typically over the past year. A recordis made of the frequency of consumption of perhaps 100 to150 items, and often includes information on serving sizes. Food frequency questionnaires may be designed to gain detailed information about specific aspects of diets, such asintak es of fats or dietar yfibre, leaving other components less well characterised. A questionnaire for whole diets cannot adequately captur ethe full variety and composition of indi - vidual diets without becoming unwieldy. Food frequency questionnaires are inexpensive, however, and are practicalfor use in large-scale epidemiological studies. Food diary or food record methods rely on the participants in the study recording everything they eat and drink over thecourse of one or mor edays. Participants may be asked to estimate portion sizes, or weigh foods and drinks. All dietary assessment methods that rely on self-reporting aresubject to measur ement err or.Further errors are intro- duced by the conversion of food data to nutrient data, using tables of the chemical composition of foods, which give aver-age nutrient contents for defined foods. This implicitlyassumes that all participants eat foods that have the samestandard composition and portion size. But in reality, foodcomposition varies widely, depending on soil quality, The Panel agr eed a'hierar chy of robust- ness' recommended by the Methodology Task For ce, which completed its work befor ethe Panel' sfirst meeting. 'hier - archy of robustness' was designed to deter- mine which types of human and animalexperimental study are likely to be most applicable to human cancer. This was done for practical and scientific r easons. The body of experimental literature is verymuch larger than the body of epidemio- logical literatur e, and an exhaustive sys - tematic r eview of this literatur ewould have been impractical. Also, most experi- mental work, such as that conducted as a guide to toxicological regulations, eitherhas no evident relevance to the work of the Panel, or else would be unlikely to sig -nificantly influence judgements derived from consideration of the collective weightof evidence fr om all other types of study . For these r easons, eight types of exper - imental evidence were identified and split into three classes: Class 1 In vivo data fr om studies in human volunteers (controlled human feeding studies). In vivo data fr om studies using genetically modified animal models related to human cancer (such as gene knockout or transgenic mouse models). In vivo data from studies using rodentcancer models designed to investigate modifiers of the cancer pr ocess. Class 2 In vitro data from studies using human cells validated with an in vivo model;for example, a transgenic model. In vitro data from studies using primaryhuman cells. In vitro data from studies using human cell lines. Class 3 In vitro data from studies on animal cells. Data fr om mechanistic test systems; for example, isolated enzymes or genes. For the systematic literature reviews in this Report, only class 1 evidence was reviewed.Illustrative evidence from in vitro studies is included only in Chapter 2.Box 3.5 Experimental findings56PART I BACKGROUND harvesting conditions, animal feed, storage, and food pro- cessing, for example. Furthermore, food tables can be incom-plete: for instance, they may not include information onphytochemical or fatty acid levels in foods. In many coun- tries, there may be no records of the composition of tradi- tional and indigenous foods. Multiple-day food r ecords or 24-hour dietar yrecalls have been used as reference instruments to check the validity of food fr equency questionnair es. 3334However ,studies using biomarkers (see 3.3.1.2) have shown that food record and recall methods are also liable to measurement error, and thatthese errors are correlated with errors from food frequencydata. This means that the use of food record or recall meth-ods to validate food frequency data results in an overesti-mation of the validity of the food fr equency data. 35-38 Often ,estimated intak es of macro- and micronutrients are adjusted for energy intake (box 3.7). 3.3.1.2 Biomarkers 'Recovery' biomarkers, such as doubly labelled water or 24- hour urinar ynitrogen ex cretion ,can be used to assess the accuracy of various dietary assessment methods. The dou- bly labelled water test accurately measures a person's totalenergy expenditure, which equals energy intake when a per-son is in energy balance. 39Urinary nitrogen excretion is used asabiomark er of protein consumption.40Studies using these recover ybiomarkers suggest that measurement errors from all types of dietar yassessment instruments ar elarger than previously appreciated.35 38 41 'Concentration' biomarkers, such as blood levels of fatty acids or vitamins, can be used to indir ectly estimate dietary intake of these compounds. However, blood levels are deter- mined not only by a person 's intak eof the compound, but also by factors such as the compound's bioavailability andexcretion, intakes of other dietary components, personal characteristics such as smoking, and individual variation inmetabolism. These determinants \u2014 and ther eforethe rela- tions between true intakes and the biomarkers \u2014 vary among people, and this can bias observed diet-cancerassociations. 9 For some compounds, such as selenium, biomarkers are a moreaccurate indicator of dietary from food fr equency questionnair es.42 43Many studies examine concentration biomarkers as indirect proxies for intake, and there is growing interest in combining these data with resultsfrom self -report dietary assessment instruments. 3.3.2 Nutrition status Nutrition status is not simply a function of dietary intake. It includes energy and nutrient intakes, and also body nutri- ent stores and body composition, all of which can be stud-ied at various levels of complexity. Nutrition status cannot be completely measured by any one method, and judging which methods are most useful is an important aspect of the science in this field. Some aspects of nutrition status can be assessed relatively accurately. These include body fatness and measurements of weight and height at birth, during growth, and in adulthood. Nutrition status is affected by other biological and behavioural factors, and also by social and environmental fac- tors. Social factors include economic and political drivers offood supplies, availability of food, and tradition and culture. 3.3.3 Physical activity Study of the effects of physical activity on health requires reli- able and valid measurements of physical activity in whatev-er setting it occurs \u2014 occupational, household, transport, and recreational \u2014 and also of frequency, duration, andintensity .Effects of physical activity ar enot just a function of total overall energy expenditure. A person may expend the same amount of energy during a short period of intenseexercise or in a longer period of moderate activity, but the physiological effects may be different. Also see Chapter 5. Assessments of physical activity may use objective bio - chemical, physiological, or other methods, but these ar e expensive and not commonly used in large studies. Epidemiological studies usually r ely on self -completed ques - tionnaires. These vary in the duration and type of physical activity, the length and detail of the questionnaire, and howthe physical activity measur es arecalculated. As with food questionnaires, physical activity question- naires have limitations. Activities may be over-reported whenparticipants overestimate their recreational activity, forexample, or under-reported, such as when participants donot tak eaccount of everyday activities, such as walking around their home or office. Many questionnair es ask only about occupational activity or r ecreational activity, and there- fore do not provide a comprehensive account of people's total physical activity. Results from questionnaires are commonly reported in terms of energy expenditure. This is usually done by assign- ing an 'ener gy cost' (derived fr om published guides) to the energyvalue of various activities, and multiplying this by the duration and frequency of the activity. But there are large variations in the energy values of different activities depend-ing on age, gender ,body mass, skill, and level of fitness; these can lead to significant errors in estimates. 3.3.4 Cancer outcomes In studies of food, nutrition, physical activity, and cancer, accurate identification of cancer occurr ence is as important as making accurate measur es of food and drink consumption , and of physical activity. In most epidemiological studies, data from cancer registries are used, or else participantsreport whether they have been diagnosed as having cancer .Effect modification (or effect-measure modification) occurs when a measure of effect for an exposure changes over levels ofanother variable (the modifier).30Effect modifiers can some- times even change the direction of an effect. For example, a pooled analysis of seven cohort studies found an association between body fatness and decreased risk of breast cancer in pre-menopausal women, but with increased risk in postmenopausal women. 31In this case, menopausal status modifies the effect of body fatness on breast cancer risk.Box 3.6 Effect modification57CHAPTER 3 JUDGING THE EVIDENCE Studies may also require participants to undergo clinical examination, or provide tissue biopsy samples. The duration of a study can also affect whether the full effects of exposures are identified. Relatively short-termprospective studies may miss any late effects on cancers. This is one reason why results from studies with long-term fol- low-up periods are particularly valuable. Population-based cancer registries collect cancer incidence and mortality data for the areas they serve, and produce can-cer registers. Inthe US, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programme collects population-based data on newly diagnosed cancers from registries that cover approximately 23 per cent of the US population. 49The European Network of Cancer Registries represents population-based cancer reg-istries in Europe. 50Population-based registries are becoming increasingly available in middle- and low-income countries. In total, 57 countries and 186 cancer registries are repre- sented in Volume VIII of the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents series published by IAR C.1Also see bo x1.2. Cancer incidence data are coded in a standardised way, using International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes that have been established for oncology.51These 10-digit codes specify the site of origin of the tumour (topography), thetumour or cell type (morphology), the behaviour of thetumour (malignant, benign, or in situ), and the tumourgrade or degree of differentiation. In addition to pr oviding cancer incidence and mortality statistics, cancer r egistries ar eused by researchers to identi- fy people who are eligible to enrol in a case-control study, or to collect information on cancer diagnosis r elating to peo - ple who are enrolled in a cohort study.3.4 Causation and risk One of the Panel's tasks has been to devise a transparent and objective method that enables evidence of relationshipsbetween diet, physical activity, body fatness, and associated factors, and cancer of one or more sites, to be judged as causal, with varying degrees of confidence. 3.4.1 Inferring causation The Panel endorses the view of the panel responsible for the previous report, that causal relationships between food and nutrition, and physical activity can be confidently inferred when epidemiological evidence, and experimental and other biological findings, are consistent, unbiased, strong, graded,coherent, repeated, and plausible. Individually, none of thesefactors is likely to be sufficient to infer a causal relationshipwith confidence. Also, individual relationships may be defi- cient in various respects, but collectively can still be judged as causal because of their cumulative weight. Many types of evidence can contribute to causal infer ence. However strong the evidence from any single study, it will rarely justify a conclusion of causality .Increasing 'sur viv- ability' of an observed relationship, when supported by fur- ther studies, or which produces corroborative evidence inother categories, as listed above, strengthens the evidencefor a causal relationship. 525 3 With regard to food and nutrition, and physical activity, single exposur es are unlikely to act alone to cause or pre- vent cancer .In general, many factors act together as con - tributory or component causes, forming a complete causal process. Component causes can interact biologically ,even when exerting their effects at different times.30 One of the basic principles in controlled human and animal feeding experiments toevaluate the effect of a specific dietary fac- tor is that the diets should be isocaloric(i.e., total energy intake is the same in both groups). This is because differences in energy intake between two groups would cause one gr oup to gain or lose mor e weight than the other .The ef fects of the dietary factor being investigated could not then be distinguished from the effects ofchanges in weight. This is important,because differences in weight themselvesmay have dif ferent physiological effects. In epidemiological studies, there are sim- ilar reasons to conduct isocaloric analyses. These use statistical methods to 'adjust' intakes of the dietar yfactor under study for total ener gy intake. The rationale for energy-adjusted intakes is that theabsolute intake of a nutrient is a functionof two factors: first, the total amount of food consumed, r epresented by total ener- gy intake; and second, the composition ofdiets. The total amount of food consumed is deter mined primarily by body size and physical activity. Body size and physical activity are of interest in their own right, but their effects need to be disentangled from the effects of a specific nutrient. This can be done by using ener gy-adjusted nutrient intakes. Expressed another way ,studies designed to change the intake of a specific nutrient usually should do so by changing the com-position of diets rather than total energyintake. Epidemiological studies thereforeshould adjust for ener gy and not r ely on absolute intakes, which reflect both dietary composition and variation in total energy intake due to dif ferences in body size and physical activity . The best method to adjust for total energy intake has been a matter of con- siderable discussion. 44-48The two basic approaches are to use the nutrient densi- ty (for example, expr essing intake per unit of energy or, for macronutrients, as a per-centage of total energy) or regression analysis to calculate nutrient r esiduals. In an epidemiological analysis, the nutrientdensity does not adequately adjust fortotal energy intake if energy intake itself is associated with disease risk. In this case, total energy intake must be added as a separate ter mto the model. Another method, that of 'ener gy par tition', has been used in some studies, but this is not an 'isocaloric' analysis and thus does notcontrol for total energy intake. An additional advantage of energy- adjusted nutrient intakes is that they ar e often measured with less error thanabsolute nutrient intakes. This is because over-or under -repor ting specific nutri - ents tends to be str ongly cor related with over-or under-reporting of total energy intake, especially for macronutrients, beingcalculated from the same foods. Theseerrors are highly correlated, so tend to can- cel each other when calculating nutrient densities or energy-adjusted intakes. Box 3.7 Ener gy adjustment58PART I BACKGROUND 3.4.2 The 'portfolio' approach Many different types of study, all of which have strengths and weaknesses, investigate links between food, nutrition, phys- ical activity, and cancer. Persuasive evidence comes from dif-ferent types of epidemiological study, supported by experimental findings that indicate a relevant biological mechanism. The Panel's judgements, presented in Part 2 of this Report, are based on its assessment of the evidence available in thescientific literature, with due consideration given to the advantages and disadvantages of each type of study design, and to the quality of individual studies. An inclusive or 'port- folio' approach has been taken, recognising the relative strengths and weaknesses of different types of study, but inwhich no single type of study design is given pre-eminence.In general, the strongest evidence comes from consistentfindings from different types of studies, preferably also in diverse populations. 3.4.3 Quantification of risk Quantification of the risk of any disease is an essential basis for public health policy planning. It also guides people in making their own decisions about how they lead their lives. It is not enough to know that the risk of cancer is affectedby diet. It is also important to know by how much. For exam-ple, if consumption of alcohol increases the risk of breast can-cer, and diets high in vegetables decrease the risk of variouscancers, to what extent may the incidence of cancer on apopulation basis be affected by these factors? And on a per - sonal level, how can people best judge how their current diets and ways of life, and any changes they might want to make, are likely to affect their own risk of cancer? Quantifying risk helps to answer such questions. The str ength of a r elationship between any risk factor and the occurrence of disease is commonly expressed in terms of relative risk (RR). In cohort studies, this is the ratio of risk(or incidence) of a disease among people with a particularcharacteristic (say, high consumption of red meat) to thatamong people without that characteristic (in this example,low or no consumption of r ed meat). In case-contr ol stud- ies, the odds ratio is used, which is the ratio of the odds ofexposure among cases to the odds of exposure among con- trols. Relative risks below 1.0 imply a protective effect: so arelative risk of 0.5 for high compared with low vegetable con- sumption implies a halving of risk. Relative risks above 1.0 indicate an incr eased risk. Absolute risk is also important. Small RR values, when consistent, are important when the number of people affect- ed is large. A large RR of a rare type of cancer amounts toonly a small absolute risk, which may r easonably be con - sidered not significant, either by public health planners or by individuals assessing their own choices. By contrast, asmall RR may amount to a large number of cases for a com- mon type of cancer. For example, an increased risk of 10 per cent implied by a RR of 1.10 amounts to many extra casesofcolor ectal and br east cancer in Eur ope and North America, where these cancers are common. Assessment of small RRs depends on the size and quality of the studies in which such risks ar eidentified. Small RRs mayamount to strong evidence if consistently found in large, well designed studies. 3.5 Coming to judgement Acrucial part of the process that has informed this Report is the methods used by the Panel in judging whether the evi- dence that a relationship between aspects of food, nutrition,physical activity, and body fatness, and cancers of the sites specified, is or may be causal. The need for evidence from different types of study and the characteristics looked for in such studies have been outlined already. Here, the precise methods used by the Panel are explained. The previous report broke new ground in a number of respects. One was to display panel judgements in the formof matrices within which panel judgements on causal rela- tionships, of different degrees of confidence, were shown, and repeated in the text of the report. This method has beenadapted in other r eports. 29Another was the specification of criteria guiding these judgements. The previous report alsoused explicit statements explaining why ,on occasion ,the panel had made judgements that did not obviously derive from the evidence as presented. One general principle wasthat of transparency. Readers and users of the previous reporthave been able to follow its reasoning, to challenge anyjudgements that might seem questionable, and to modify or reinforce judgements in the light of further and better evidence. The Panel responsible for this Report decided to adapt those innovative appr oaches, and use them as the basis for its work. Some of the judgements made in this Report are different from those based on the evidence available adecade pr eviously ,while others confirm or str engthen pr e- vious judgements. 3.5.1 The matrix approach An example of a matrix used in this Report is shown in fig- ure3.1. This particular matrix displays the Panel's judge- ments on the lik elihood that physical activity modifies the risk of cancers of specified sites. This matrix is used her eas an example, to explain the nature of the matrices displayed in all chapters in Part 2 of this Report. This matrix and itsjudgements ar ediscussed fully in Chapter 5. The title of the matrix is self-explanatory. In this and other cases, the intr oductor ywords are important: here, the footnote specifies that the physical activity r eferred to is of all types. The matrices display the Panel's judgements on whether particular aspects of food and nutrition ,physical activity ,and body composition do or may modify (or not modify) the risk of cancers of specific sites. The matrices are of course short-hand, and the entries cannot convey all nuances. Necessary clarifications and qualifications are stated in footnotes to the matrices. Matrix entries themselves need to be explained. F or exam - ple, an entry 'fruits' or 'foods containing dietary fibre' in a matrix column headed 'decreases risk' means that the Panelhas judged that these foods ar eor may be pr otective against59CHAPTER 3 JUDGING THE EVIDENCE the cancer specified. The judgements ar ederived fr om analysis of studies in which relatively high intakes of (in this example) fruits and foods containing dietary fibre are com-pared with r elatively low intak es. The same point applies to matrix entries 'physical activity' and 'body 'increases risk', respec-tively, which are derived from analysis of studies of peoplewhose physical activity levels or degree of body fatness isrelatively high compared with people whose physical activ- ity levels or degr ee of body fatness is r elatively low. In some cases, analysis may show that any effect begins or ends, or is less apparent, below or above evident 'thresh- olds'. For example, it has been thought that alcoholic drinksincrease the risk of some cancers only above certain levels of consumption. Such amounts would be specified in a foot- note to the r elevant matrices, and could be r eflected in Panel recommendations. When matrices include no such foot - notes, this is because no lower or upper threshold of effect has been identified. In such cases, matrix entries showingor suggesting a causal association should be tak en to mean that the effect is across the whole range of dietary intake, amounts of physical activity, or degrees of body fatnessfound in the studies analysed. The implications of the nature of the dose-response relationships for recommendations are further discussed in Chapter 12, in P art 3 of this Report. 3.5.2 Levels and types of judgement The top half of the matrix in figure 3.1 shows that the evidence of causality ,either of decr eased risk or incr eased risk, is judged to be convincing, or else probably causal. A judgement of 'convincing' in turn generally justifies a recom- mendation designed to inform policies and programmes designed to prevent cancer. A judgement of 'probable' alsonormally justifies a recommendation. So in the case of the matrix shown, it follows that the Panel would make a rec- ommendation on physical activity designed to reduce the risk of cancer. The top two rows of the matrix are separated from the row below, which shows judgements that the evidence is too lim- ited, for a variety of reasons (see 3.5.5), to conclude that a relationship is causal, but that there are enough data to suggest that such a relationship might exist. Normally, a judgement of 'limited \u2014 suggestive' does not justify any rec-ommendation. The matrices used in Chapter 7 also includearow showing judgements where the evidence is so limited (again for a variety of reasons) that no judgement can be made whether any association exists or not. For this reason, such judgements of 'limited \u2014 no conclusion' do not indi-cate whether the evidence is in the dir ection of decr easing or increasing risk. The final, bottom row of the matrix, 'sub- stantial effect on risk unlik ely', shows judgements for which the evidence, equivalent to a judgement of 'convincing' or 'probable', shows that no causal relationship is likely to exist. Terms used in the text and matrices to refer to foods and drinks, physical activity, body fatness, and other factors arenecessarily shorthand. Thus, in chapter 4.2, the matrix dis-plays judgements that 'non-star chy vegetables' probably pro- tect against a number of cancers. The matrix in chapter 4.8 displays judgements that the evidence that 'alcoholic drinks'cause a number of cancers is convincing. What is meant by 'non-starchy vegetables' and by 'alcoholic drinks' is defined in the text of these sections. Further ,when 'non-star chy vegetables' is used as a matrix entry and contained in Panel judgements, it means 'relatively high consumption of non-starchy vegetables and/or foodscontaining them'. The same point applies to many othermatrix entries and also to the accompanying text. Within all matrix cells, exposures are listed in the order of the contents of the R eport. Ther eare a number of cancer sites wher easubstantial number of r elated exposures meet the criteria for matrix entry. The Panel has judged that it is often appropriate to aggregate such exposures. For example, ifboth 'alcoholic drinks' and ' wine' are judged as exposures that probably increase the risk of a type of cancer, then only 'alcoholic drinks' will appear in the matrix for thatcancer site. The matrices used in this Report differ from those used in the previous report in a number of respects. The previousreport used categories of 'possible' and 'insufficient' defined differently from the categories of 'limited \u2014 suggestive' and 'limited \u2014 no conclusion' used here. Also, the previous reportallowed for different weights of evidence for no causal rela- tionship, whereas this Report includes just the one judge- ment of 'substantial effect on risk unlik ely'. The judgements of'convincing' and 'pr obable', both agr eed to be a sufficient basis for recommendations, are common to both reports, although the criteria allowing such judgements have beenrefined for this R eport (see 3.5.5). Figur e3.1 Example of a matrixPHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND THE RISK OF CANCER Inthe judgement of the Panel, physical activity1modifies the risk of the following cancers. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence. DECREASES RISK INCREASES RISK Convincing Colon2 Probable Breast (postmenopause) Endometrium Limited \u2014 Lung suggestivePancreas Breast (premenopause) Substantial effect on risk None identified unlikely 1Physical activity of all types: occupational, household, transport, and recreational. 2 Much of the evidence reviewed grouped colon cancer and rectal cancer together as 'colorectal' cancer. The Panel judges that the evidence is stronger for colon than for rectum. For an explanation of the ter ms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this chapter, and the glossary. 60PART I BACKGROUND 3.5.3 The food-based approach Terms used in the text of this Report and in the matrices reflect the Panel's decision that the Report, and its judge- ments and r ecommendations, should whenever possible be based on foods and drinks rather than on nutrients. Thisfood- (and drink-) based approach is also apparent in the overall structure of the Report. Chapter 4, the first chapterin Part 2, on foods and drinks, is the longest chapter .This is in part because dietary constituents associated with foods are grouped with these foods. Thus, matrix entries in chapter 4.1identify 'foods containing dietary fibre' (rather than dietary fibre), and in 4.8 identify 'alcoholic drinks' (rather than alco- hol or ethanol). Chapters 4, 5, and 6 also include materialpresented graphically ,such as the for est plots described in box 3.3. The food-based approach is also justified because of the uncertainty that any food constituent is a true causal factor ,rather than simply a marker for the particular foods in which it is found; or for other dietar yconstituents found in the same foods; or other associated health-related factors. In chapter 4.10, some micr onutrients appear in matrices grad - ed as 'convincing' or 'pr obable'. These judgements ar e derived from the findings of good quality, randomised, con- trolled trials, sometimes also supported by observationalstudies, clearly showing that supplements of these micr onu- trients, rather than the foods containing them, affect the risk of cancer. Sometimes the studies that are the basis for the Panel's work have used markers of exposure. Thus, many epidemiological studies use body mass index as a mark er of body fatness. When ther eis clear evidence of an underlying mechanism for body fatness, the Panel has agreed that the term 'body fatness' best represents the causal factor. Usually, anthropometricindices \u2014 other examples being waist to hip ratio and waistThis box lists the criteria finally agreed by the Panel that were necessary to support the judgements shown in the matrices and text of the Part 2 chapters. The gradesshown here are 'convincing', 'probable', 'limited \u2014 suggestive', con-clusion', and 'substantial effect on risk unlikely'. In effect, the criteria define theseterms. Convincing These criteria are for evidence strong enough to support a judgement of a con- vincing causal relationship, which justifiesgoals and recommendations designed to reduce the incidence of cancer. Aconvincing relationship should be robust enough to be highly unlikely to be modified in the foreseeable future as new evidence accumulates. All of the following weregenerally r equired: Evidence fr ommorethan one study type. Evidence from at least two independent cohort studies. No substantial unexplained heterogeneity within or between study types or in different populationsrelating to the presence or absence ofan association, or direction of effect. Good quality studies to exclude with confidence the possibility that theobserved association results from random or systematic error, includingconfounding, measur ement er ror, and selection bias. Presence of a plausible biological gradient ('dose response') in theassociation. Such a gradient need not be linear or even in the same directionacross the different levels of exposure,solong as this can be explained plausibly. Strong and plausible experimental evidence, either from human studies orrelevant animal models, that typical human exposures can lead to relevantcancer outcomes. Probable These criteria are for evidence strong enough to support a judgement of a prob-able causal relationship, which would gen- erally justify goals and recommendations designed to reduce the incidence of cancer. All the following were generally required: Evidence from at least two independentcohort studies, or at least five case- control studies. No substantial unexplained heter ogeneity between or within study types in the pr esence or absence of an association, or direction of effect. Good quality studies to exclude withconfidence the possibility that theobserved association results fromrandom or systematic error, includingconfounding, measurement error, andselection bias. Evidence for biological plausibility. Limited \u2014 suggestive These criteria are for evidence that is too limited to per mit a pr obable or convincing causal judgement, but where there is evi- dence suggestive of a dir ection of ef fect. The evidence may have methodologicalflaws, or be limited in amount, but shows agenerally consistent direction of effect. This almost always does not justify recom-mendations designed to reduce the inci- dence of cancer. Any exceptions to this require special explicit justification. All the following were generally required: Evidence from at least two independentcohort studies or at least five case- control studies. The direction of effect is generally consistent though some unexplained heterogeneity may be present. Evidence for biological plausibility. Limited \u2014 no conclusion Evidence is so limited that no firm conclu- sion can be made. This category represents an entry level, and is intended to allow any exposure for which there are sufficient data to warrant Panel consideration, but where insufficient evidence exists to per mit a mor edefinitive grading. This does not necessarily mean a limited quantity of evidence. A body of evi-dence for a particular exposure might begraded 'limited \u2014 no conclusion' for anumber of reasons. The evidence might belimited by the amount of evidence in termsof the number of studies available, byinconsistency of direction of effect, by poor quality of studies (for example, lackof adjustment for known confounders), or by any combination of these factors. Exposures that are graded 'limited \u2014 noconclusion' do not appear in the matrices presented in Chapters 4-6, but do appear in Chapters 7 and 8. When an exposure is graded 'limited \u2014 no conclusion', this does not necessarily indicate that the Panel has judged thatthere is evidence of no relationship. WithBox 3.8 Criteria for grading evidence61CHAPTER 3 JUDGING THE EVIDENCE circumference \u2014 do not appear in the matrices. As ex ceptions to this approach, the Panel has made judge- ments on 'adult attained height' and 'greater birth shown in the matrices. Many epidemiological studies havereported on height and birth weight. It is thought that asso - ciations between height, birth weight, and cancer risk reflect some causal association with a combination of genetic, hor-monal, nutritional, and other factors. Uncertainty as to the mechanisms underlying the observations with 'adult attained height' and 'birth weight' mean that the Panel was not ableto determine the appropriate causal factors to be shown in the matrices. Instead, the anthropometric markers have been included, with appr opriate footnotes. 3.5.4 The basis for robust judgements The Panel has been particularly careful in deciding the cri- teria for judgement on causal r elationships (or lack of suchrelationships). Its decisions here have been enlightened by the rapid development since the mid-1990s of the technique of systematic review, using search techniques enabled by the electr onic r evolution. Since the mid-1990s, about as many studies in the field of this Report have been published as were published in the previous 35 years. This development has not just been oneof quantity but also of design and quality .Inparticular ,many cohort studies have been published in the period analysed by the SLRs, and some of these have also been pooled. ThePanel agreed that in general, cohort studies provide more impressive evidence than case-control and other epidemio- logical study designs, and this decision affected the criteriafor judgement. F or this r eason ,while the best evidence comes from a number of different study designs, the Panel agreed that reasonably strong and consistent evidence wasneeded fr om studies wher ebiases could r easonably befurther good quality research, any expo- sure graded in this way might in the future beshown to increase or decrease the risk ofcancer. Where there is sufficient evi- dence to give confidence that an exposure is unlikely to have an effect on cancer risk,this exposure will be judged 'substantial effect on risk unlikely'. There are also many exposures for which there is such limited evidence that no judgement is possible. In these cases, evi-dence is recorded in the full SLR reports contained on the CD included with this Report. However, such evidence is usuallynot included in the summaries and is not included in the matrices in this printed Report. Substantial effect on risk unlikely Evidence is str ong enough to suppor ta judgement that a particular food, nutri- tion, or physical activity exposure is unlike-ly to have a substantial causal r elation to a cancer outcome. The evidence should be robust enough to be unlikely to be modi-fied in the foreseeable future as new evi-dence accumulates. All of the following were generally requir ed: Evidence from more than one study type. Evidence fr om at least two independent cohort studies. Summar yestimate of ef fect close to 1.0 for comparison of high versus lowexposure categories. No substantial unexplainedheter ogeneity within or between study types or in different populations. Good quality studies to exclude, withconfidence, the possibility that the absence of an observed association results from random or systematic error, including inadequate power, imprecision or error in exposure measurement, inadequate range ofexposure, confounding, and selection bias. Absence of a demonstrable biological gradient ('dose response'). Absence of strong and plausibleexperimental evidence, either from human studies or relevant animal models, that typical human exposureslead to relevant cancer outcomes. Factors that might misleadingly imply an absence of effect include imprecision ofthe exposure assessment, an insufficient range of exposur ein the study population, and inadequate statistical power. Defects in these and other study design attributesmight lead to a false conclusion of noeffect. The presence of a plausible, relevant biological mechanism does not necessarilyrule out a judgement of 'substantial effecton risk unlikely'. But the presence ofrobust evidence fr om appr opriate animal models or in humans that a specific mech- anism exists, or that typical exposures canlead to cancer outcomes, ar gues against such a judgement. Because of the uncer tainty inher ent in concluding that an exposure has no effecton risk, the criteria used to judge an expo- sure 'substantial effect on risk unlikely' areroughly equivalent to the criteria used with at least a 'probable' level of confi- dence. Conclusions of 'substantial effect onrisk unlikely' with a lower confidence than this would not be helpful, and could overlap with judgements of 'limited \u2014 sug- gestive' or 'limited \u2014 no conclusion'. Special upgrading factors These are factors that form part of the assessment of the evidence that, when pre-sent, can upgrade the judgement reached. So an exposure that might be deemed a 'limited \u2014 suggestive' causal factor in theabsence, say, of a biological gradient, might be upgraded to 'probable' in its presence. The application of these factors(listed below) requires judgement, and the way in which these judgements affect the final conclusion in the matrix are stated.Presence of a plausible biologicalgradient ('dose response') in the association. Such a gradient need not be linear or even in the same direction across the different levels of exposure,so long as this can be explainedplausibly. Aparticularly large summary effect size (an odds ratio or relative risk of 2.0 ormore, depending on the unit ofexposure) after appropriate control forconfounders. Evidence from randomised trials inhumans. Evidence fr om appropriately controlled experiments demonstrating one or moreplausible and specific mechanisms actually operating in humans. Robust and reproducible evidence from experimental studies in appropriateanimal models showing that typical human exposures can lead to relevant cancer outcomes. 62PART I BACKGROUND excluded. Usually this evidence came from cohort studies with a prospective design or, where available and appropri- ate, from randomised controlled trials, to allow a judgement of 'convincing' or 'probable'. This was not a requirement spec-ified for the previous report. See box 3.8. Aconsequence is that the same amount of evidence for any particular association has sometimes led to a different judge- ment and level of matrix entry from the previous report. Sometimes, in cases where there is a greater quantity of evi-dence, this might not lead to a 'higher' classification, and could even possibly lead to a 'lower' one. These refinements are intended to give as robust an assessment as possible, given current understanding. In these respects, the criteria used by the Panel are more stringent than those pioneeredby the previous panel. The Panel agreed that the criteria for their judgements should be detailed and precise. But such criteria do not lead to automatic judgements. However meticulous, they cannot replace expert judgement. If a reviewer or a Panelmember felt that important considerations had been over - looked by the overall agreed process, this was discussed, and the P anel's final judgement specified, with r easons provided. 3.5.5 The grading criteria Specification of criteria for the grading of judgements enables a common, transparent approach. But as indicated,any such criteria cannot fully captur ethe sophistication and nuances of all the studies consider ed, or the natur eand qual- ity of different studies. In using the criteria specified her e, the P anel has tak en into account additional factors including, but not confined to, the type, number, and size of studies; their design and execu-tion; the natur eofany inter vention; the definition of cases and non-cases; the selection of any comparison group; meth- ods of characterising exposure and outcome; length andcompleteness of follow-up; and the methods used to ascer-tain cases. Other factors might lead to one or another grading. F ailure to achieve a higher grade might r esult fr om several small deficits against a number of standar ds, or fr om a major short- fall in one particular aspect of evidence. Panel expertise was essential in judging whether criteria were met, or 'upgrad-ing factors' (bo x3.8) were applicable, as well as deciding what constituted substantial heterogeneity, high-quality study design ,and so on .The criteria provide a consistent basis for judgement, not a 'set of bo xes to be tick ed'. As well as these 'upgrading factors', particular reasons why any spe- cific judgement was reached are presented under the rele-vant exposur eand cancer site in Chapters 4-7. The following grading criteria specify the quantity, quali- ty, and nature of evidence that can lead to associations beinggraded differently. Convincing, pr obable In considering the criteria allowing a judgement that the evi - dence of a causal relationship was convincing, or that the evidence showed a probable causal relationship, the Panelwas conscious that both judgements wer eliable to generatepublic health goals and personal recommendations. Limited and 'below' For the two types of 'limited' judgement, the evidence falls short of a 'higher' judgement for a variety of reasons. There are also many exposures for which evidence was so limited that it did not warrant detailed consideration. In these cases, evidence is recorded in the full SLR reports contained on the CD included with this Report. However, this evidence is notincluded in the summaries or matrices in this printed Report. Absence of a causal relation The strength of this judgement corresponds to that for 'con- vincing' or 'probable' (and replaces the previous report's 'norelationship' category). This judgement does not reflect theabsence of evidence, which in itself is not evidence ofabsence of effect. As with judgements of 'convincing' or 'probable', evidence from both observational studies and ran- domised trials contribute to such an inference. 3.6 Conclusions Reports such as this address issues of public importance. They are informed by a process of collection, display, dis-cussion, and judgement of evidence as the basis for recom-mendations made in the public interest. We, the members of the Panel responsible for this Report, have had the r esponsibility to ensur ethat the judgements we have made in Part 2, and the public health goals and per- sonal r ecommendations we have specified in P art 3, ar e clearly and reliably based on current evidence. In the five years of our work, we have built on the work of the pr evious r eport, and have been supported by the findings of a preliminary Methodology Task Force; by the evidence gathered and presented by independent SLR centres; byobservers from United Nations and other international organ-isations; and by the Report's Secretariat. As far as we know,the whole pr ocess, which has also included eight face-to-face Panel meetings, each lasting up to four days, is the most com - prehensive and rigor ous of its kind yet undertaken. As this chapter shows, no method used to ascertain causal relationships between food, nutrition, physical activity, andcancer is perfect. But we believe that the integrated and sometimes innovative approaches we have taken, sum- marised her e, have enabled us to mak esound judgements and r eliable r ecommendations. W ehave also done our best to make sure that the methods we have used are explained and displayed transparently, so they can be readily accessedand challenged as science develops, or fr om differ ent points of view.

In this central part of the Report, seven chapters display the findings of the independently assembled systematic literatur e reviews, and the judgements of the Panel derived from these reviews and other evidence as needed. The Panel's judgements are displayed in the form of matrices that introduce five of thesechapters. Judgements of 'convincing' and 'probable' causal relationships,shown in the top part of these matrices, are the basis for recommendationsmade in Part 3 of the Report. Chapter 4, the first and longest chapter that follows, is concer ned with types of food and drink. The judgements of the Panel are generally food- and drink-based, r eflecting the evidence. Findings on dietar y constituents and micronutrients are identified as, for example, on 'foods containing dietary fibre' or 'foods containing folate'. For consistency, findings on methods of foodprocessing ar e, wher e possible, shown as par t of the whole evidence on the associated foods so that, for example, the processing and preparation of meat is integrated with the evidence on meat. Evidence specifically on dietarysupplements and on patterns of diet is included in the two final sections of thischapter. Chapters 5 and 6 ar e concer ned with physical activity, and with body composition, gr owth, and development. Evidence in these ar eas is more impressive than was the case up to the mid-1990s; the evidence on growth and development indicates the importance of a whole life-course approach to theprevention of cancer. As with the chapter on foods and drinks, these chapters include detailed summaries of the evidence collected in the systematic literatur e reviews together with graphic representations of the most significant evidence. Chapter 7 summarises and judges the evidence as applied to 17 cancer sites, with briefer summaries based on nar rative r eviews on cancers of five other body systems and sites. The judgements as shown in the matrices in this chapter correspond with the judgements shown in the matrices in the previous chapters. Chapter 8, in which judgements ar e also based on the evidence from the systematic literatur e reviews amplified by knowledge of physiological processes, concerns the biological and associated determinants of weight gain, overweight, and obesity. Before work on this chapter began, the Panel agreedthat a compr ehensive r eview of the evidence would be likely to show thatPART 2EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTSIntroduction to Part 265obesity is or may be a cause of a number of cancers. It was therefore important to identify what aspects of food, nutrition, and physical activity themselvesaffect the risk of obesity and associated factors. Improved screening, diagnosis, and medical services, including therapy and surgery, are in many countries improving the rates of survival for people withcancer . The number of cancer sur vivors \u2014 people living after diagnosis of cancer \u2014 is therefore increasing. The relevance of food, nutrition, physical activity, and body composition to people living with cancer , and to the pr evention of recurrent cancer, is summarised in Chapter 9. The Panel agreed that its final recommendations should be principally based on the evidence concerning cancer, and also should take into account findings onfood, nutrition, physical activity, and the prevention of other chronic diseases,and of nutritional deficiencies and nutrition-r elated infectious diseases, especially of childhood. Chapter 10, which is also based on a systematicliterature review, is a summary of the findings of expert reports in these areas. The proposals for further research contained in Chapter 11 are, in the view of the Panel, the most promising avenues to explore in order to refineunderstanding of the links between food, nutrition, physical activity , and cancer, and so improve the prevention of cancer, worldwide. As expected, a comprehensive assessment of all relevant types of evidence relating to food, nutrition, physical activity, body composition, and the risk ofcancer has pr oved to be a massive task. The Panel was impressed not only by the quantity but also the quality of much of the evidence, and the degr ee to which a gr eat deal of the evidence was consistent. As a r esult, recommendations designed to prevent cancer in general can be made with confidence. These are contained in Part 3. 66PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS This chapter, with the following chapters in Part Two, forms the basis for the population goals andpersonal recommendations in Part Three. The Panel decided that the evidence on food, nutrition, and cancer is generally most persuasive for foods rather than for specific nutrients or otherfood constituents; and that the evidence fr om epidemiological and experimental studies in thisfield, usually under taken to addr ess questions about cancers of specific or related sites, is most usefully synthesised in terms of foods and drinks. The detailed evidence on foods and drinks is presented in this chapter, and that on physicalactivity and on body composition in the followingtwo chapters. These thr ee chapters include summaries of the evidence, including meta-analysespresented in graphic form, as well as the Panel'sjudgements. Chapter 7 pr esents the evidence on cancer sites in more summarised form. In this chapter, whenever possible and appr opriate, the evidence on dietar y constituents, and on food production, preservation, processing,and preparation (including cooking), is integratedwith the evidence on foods and drinks. So here, forexample, the evidence on carotenoids is consideredtogether with the evidence on vegetables andfruits; the evidence on methods of cooking meats is consider ed with the evidence on r ed meat and on processed meats; and the evidence on ethanol is considered with alcoholic drinks. The r esult is not perfect. There is no single, ideal way of categorising the evidence on food and nutrition. But an appr oach emphasising foods and drinks is consistent with the generally acceptedview that food-based dietary guidelines andrecommendations are particularly valuable as a foundation for policies designed to impr ove public health. The first two sections of this chapter summarise and judge the evidence on plant foods; the nexttwo sections that on animal foods; and thefollowing two sections that on fats and oils, andsugars and salt. The next two sections concer n drinks, the second of which covers alcoholic drinks. These are followed by sections concerned withthose aspects of dietar y constituents, and with foodproduction, preservation, processing, and preparation (including cooking), that have not beenincorporated in previous sections. The final sectionsummarises evidence on dietary patterns, including being breastfed. The pattern that emerges, though different in some impor tant r espects, is lar gely similar to that based on the evidence gathered in the mid-1990s, although the confidence with which variousexposures are judged to cause or protect fromcancer has sometimes changed. Foods and drinksCHAPTER 467CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS These star chy plant foods have been the staple sources of dietary ener gy and bulk for humans since the development of settled communities and agricultur e. They have to be prepared in some way to make them edible. In whole or relatively unprocessed forms, they are alsosources of dietary fibre and various micronutrients. Cereals in whole form contain essential fats. When the outer layers of these foods ar e removed and they are refined, most of what r emains is star ch and pr otein. In general, with industrialisation and urbanisation, consumption of these foods decreases, and more is consumed in the form of cer eal pr oducts, which ar e typically more energy-dense and which may contain substantial amounts of fat, sugar, or salt. Pure starch from these foods is also used as an ingredient in manyprocessed foods. Wheat, rice, maize (corn), and potatoesand their pr oducts are now the main cereals and roots/tubers pr oduced and consumed globally . Overall, the Panel judges that evidence indicating that cereals (grains), roots, tubers, or plantains affect the riskof any cancer , remains insubstantial. The P anel judges as follows: Foods containing dietary fibr e probably protect against color ectal cancer ; and there is limited evidence suggesting that such foods protect against oesophageal cancer. Dietary fibre is found in plant foods: vegetables,fruits, and pulses (legumes) (see chapter 4.2), as well asin cereals, roots, tubers, and plantains. All these foods arehighest in dietary fibr e when in whole or minimally processed form. Foods high in dietary fibre may have a protective effect because of being bulky and relatively low in energy density . See chapters 6.1, 7.3, 7.9, and Chapter 8 for discussion of the role of energy density in weight gain, overweight, and obesity, and of weight gain, overweight, and obesity in the risk of some cancers, including those ofthe oesophagus and colorectum. The P anel also judges that the evidence that foods contaminated with aflato xins ar e a cause of liver cancer is convincing. Cereals (grains) and peanuts (see chapter 4.2) are the foods most commonly infested by thesefungal to xins. Contamination is most widespr ead in CEREALS (GRAINS), STARCHY ROOTS AND TUBERS, PLANTAINS, AND THE RISK OF CANCER In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence. DECREASES RISK INCREASES RISK Exposure Cancer site Exposure Cancer site Convincing Aflatoxins1Liver Probable Foods containing Colorectum dietary fibre2 Limited \u2014 Foods containing Oesophagus suggestive dietary fibre2 Substantial effect on risk None identified unlikely 1Foods that may be contaminated with aflatoxins include cereals (grains), and also pulses (legumes), seeds, nuts, and some vegetables and fruits (see chapter 4.2). 2 Includes both foods naturally containing the constituent and foods which have the constituent added (see chapter 3.5.3). Dietary fibre is contained in plant foods (see chapter 4.2 and box 4.1.2). For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. 4.1 Cereals (grains), roots, tubers, and plantains68PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS countries with hot, damp climates and poor storage facilities. Within the remit of this Report, the strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of 'convincing' and'probable', shows that foods containing dietary fibreprobably protect against colorectal cancer; and that foodscontaminated with aflatoxins are a convincing cause of liver cancer. Also see chapter 4.2 for judgements ofprobable protective effects of foods containing variousmicronutrients also found in cereals, roots, and tubers,particularly when relatively unprocessed. Cereals (grains) are the staple foods in large parts of the world, supplying most of the energy and bulk in diets. In some regions,roots, tubers, or plantains are staple foods as well as or insteadof cereals (grains). These generalisations apply to practically all settled rural and most urban populations. Monotonous 'poverty diets' containing very high levels of these foods, par-ticularly if r efined, ar e low and sometimes inadequate in pr o- tein and other nutrients. Gatherer-hunter and pastoral communities usually consume less of these star chy foods. Their nutrient content is variable, largely depending on the degree to which they are refined. Consumption of cereals, roots, and tubers in general gradu- ally drops with industrialisation and urbanisation, and anincreasing amount of wheat in particular is grown for animalfeed. These foods ar e increasingly used as a basis for or ingre- dients in pr ocessed pr oducts that are often energy-dense, high in fats or sugars, and sometimes salt. In lower-income countries, total population consumption of these foods may amount to 60-80 per cent of total energy, and in high- income countries, usually to less than 30 per cent. Also seeChapter 1. Early reports concerned with nutritional deficiencies gen- erally did not pay much attention to these foods and insteadgave priority to energy- and nutrient-dense foods of animalorigin, such as milk, eggs, and meat. Beginning in the 1970s,interest in dietary fibre increased, following informal epi- demiological findings that diets high in dietar y fibr e were associated with a lower risk of a number of chr onic diseases. 1 2By the 1990s, it was generally agreed that diets relatively high in cereals (grains) and other starchy staple foods, prefer-ably r elatively unrefined, protect against obesity, type 2 dia- betes, coronary heart disease, and perhaps also digestive disor ders. 3 4Evidence that such diets pr otect against cancer of any site has been less impr essive, but epidemiological studies tend not to distinguish between degrees of refine- ment of cereals, roots, and tubers. This section (4.1) includes cer eal pr oducts and dietar y fibre. It also includes contamination by aflatoxins, though this may also affect other plant foods (also see chapter 4.2).Non-starchy root vegetables such as carrots are included in chapter 4.2. Micronutrients found in plant foods are includ- ed in chapter 4.2, though most of these ar e also found in cereals (grains), r oots, tubers, and plantains.4.1.1 Definitions, sources Cereals (grains) Cereals (grains) are the seeds and energy stores of cultivat- ed grasses. The main types are wheat, rice, maize (corn), millet, sorghum, barley, oats, and rye. In some countries, 'cereal' is also a term for dry foods made from grains and other ingredients, often eaten with milk for breakfast. Roots, tubers, plantains Roots and tubers are energy stores of plants. Names and def- initions can vary around the world \u2014 potatoes are tubers, which are the tips of underground stems that swell with starch (a polysaccharide) and water. While potatoes areoften classed as vegetables (in the USA, for instance), theyare grouped separately from non-starchy vegetables in thisReport. Sweet potatoes, sometimes called 'yams' in North America, are a type of storage root rather than a tuber, but true yams are starchy tubers. Cassava (manioc) and yuccaare elongated r oots, and sago is a star chy food made fr om the pith of some types of palm tree. Taro is cultivated for its edible leaves, as well as its star chy corm, which is similar to a tuber. Plantains are one of several fruits used as vegeta- bles: they grow on trees and look like bananas, but only asmall proportion of the starch is converted to sugar duringthe ripening process, which makes them similar to potatoesto cook with. Many of the cereals (grains) that we consume are refined. Grains are first br oken into pieces and then r efined, sifting away the bran, germ and, usually, the aleurone layer. This removes most of the fibr e, oil, and B vitamins, as well as appr oximately 25 per cent of the protein. Polishing, as often performed on rice,removes additional nutrients. Many high-income countries therefore fortify refined cereals, including flour, with B vitaminsand iron. Wholegrain products generally contain the con- stituents of the grain but, given the absence of an internation- ally accepted definition, intact grains are present to a variable extent. The extent to which the grain remains intact influencesphysiological processes in the bowel and hence health. Cereal foods may be eaten in wholegrain for m, although con - sumption in r efined forms, such as white rice, bread, or pasta, is generally much more common, particularly in high-income countries. Refined grains ar e consider ed easier than wholegrains to cook and to chew; are light in colour \u2014 which is attractive to many consumers; and also have a longer shelf-life than wholegrain products, as the oil in bran goes rancid relatively quickly. Breakfast cereals, particularly in the United States and parts of Eur ope, also account for a significant pr opor tion of grain eaten. Many breakfast cereals, although based on grains (whole or refined), may contain substantial amounts of added sugars. Grains ar e fur ther pr ocessed to pr ovide ingr edients such as corn syrup, starch, or alcohol. They also form the basis of many animal feeds. Processed grains have a higher glycaemic index than unprocessed grains and, generally, the greater the degree ofprocessing, the greater the glycaemic index (box 4.1.3).Box 4.1.1 Wholegrain and refined cereals and their products69CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS The concept of dietary fibre arose from observations of the low prevalence of colon cancer, diabetes, and coronary heart disease in parts of Africa amongst people whose diets were high in unrefined carbohydrates and whose stools were typically bulky, and often or sometimes semisolid. Considerable efforts have been dedicated to characterising the dietary components of what has come to be called dietary fibre that might confer health benefit. Naturally occurring dietary fibre is only derived from plant foods. Pulses (legumes) and minimally processed cereals are particularly concentrated sources, but vegetables and fruits also contain significant amounts. Dietary fibre isolated from plant cell walls and in synthetic forms are increasingly entering the food supply. High intakes of dietary fibre, variously defined, have been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease as well as of some cancers. Definitions of dietary fibre vary. Some arebased on chemical analyses of the components of plant cell walls, such as non-starch polysaccharide, others on physiologi- cal effects \u2014 the carbohydrates that enter the large bowel hav- ing escaped digestion in the small intestine being defined as dietar y fibr e. The latter definition includes oligosaccharides and resistant starch. The World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have recently proposed that only poly-saccharides which form part of plant cell walls should be regard-ed as dietar y fibr e and that the health benefits of r esistant starch and oligosaccharides are more appropriately considered separately.Box 4.1.2 Foods containing dietary fibre The degree to which different foods and meals raise blood glu- cose depends not only on the nature of the carbohydrate, but also on the characteristics of the foods consumed. Glycaemic index (GI) is a measure of the degree to which a food raises blood glucose compared with a standard food (usually glucose or white bread) under standard conditions. The test food must contain the same amount of available carbohydrate (usually 50 grams) as the standard. GI was originally used as an aid to food choice in diabetes and has more recently been applied to peo- ple without diabetes. The rise in blood glucose after consuming a food depends not only on the GI but also on the amount of food eaten. A related measure, glycaemic load (GL), takes into account both the GI of a food as well as the actual amount of carbohydrate consumed. The GL of a food may be measureddirectly or calculated by multiplying the GI of a food by the num- ber of carbohydrate grams in a serving of the food. Factors that influence the GI of a food include the type of car- bohydrate, how the food is processed or cooked, and the other components present in the food (for example, fat, protein, fibre). There is some relationship (inverse) between GI and fibre content, although some foods high in fibr e have a high GI and vice versa. Factors can af fect GI by influencing speed of absorp- tion, for instance higher fat foods tend to have a low GI. Thecalculated GI of a mixed meal or whole diet has been shown insome studies to cor relate with the actual GI obtained by feed - ing a mixed meal. Although the concept of GI has been contr o- versial, the GI and GL of diets have predicted risks of type 2 diabetes and cor onar y heart disease and related biomarkers, independent of dietary fibre, in prospective epidemiological studies, suggesting that GI and GL may be useful markers. The r elevance to cancer might lie in the fact that the rise in blood glucose after a meal is closely linked to that of insulin, which apart from its crucial role in carbohydrate and lipidmetabolism, is also one of a family of impor tant gr owth factors (also see Chapter 2).Box 4.1.3 Glycaemic index and load This section r efers to star chy r oots, tubers, and plantains. Carrots, beets, parsnips, turnips, and swedes are non-starchy roots, and are classified as non-starchy vegetables in thisReport. Also see chapter 4.2. 4.1.2 Composition Cereals (grains) The r elative amounts of dietar y constituents in cereals and cereal foods depend lar gely on the degree of refinement and other forms of processing (box 4.1.1). Starch makes up about 70 per cent of the raw weight of the storage tissues(endosperm) of unpr ocessed cereal grains. The outer parts of the grain (the bran and the aleurone layer) contain non- starch polysaccharide, a type of carbohydrate that charac - terises dietar y fibr e (bo x 4.1.2). Cereals also contain variable amounts of protein, oils, B vitamins, vitamin E and tocotrienols, iron, and various traceelements, as well as phytochemicals, some of which, such as the antioxidants, are bioactive (box 4.1.2). The germ is the embryonic part of cereal plants and contains oils, pro-teins, and fibre. Various cereals contain other specific com- ponents. Wheat contains gluten (a mixture of proteins). Rye has high levels of pentosans and oats contain beta-glucans,both of which ar e non-star ch polysaccharides, a character - ising feature of dietary Cereals (grains) and pulses (legumes) may be contami- 4.1.4. Roots, tubers, and plantains Roots and tubers ar e less concentrated stores of starch, although this accounts for almost all of their raw weight apart from water. Starch content varies from around 15-20per cent in sweet potatoes to 25-30 per cent in cassava and yams, which translates into around 80-95 per cent of the dietar y ener gy of these roots and tubers. Cooking sweet potatoes mak es them taste sweet because an enzyme con - verts as much as 75 per cent of the starch into maltose (a disaccharide). Roots and tubers eaten with the skin on arehigh in dietar y fibr e. These foods ar e generally poor sour ces of protein, so although protein deficiency is uncommon, populations that subsist on these foods, and do not eat pro-tein-rich pulses (legumes), are at risk of deficiency, especially children weaned on thin gruels made with these low-protein foods. They contain variable amounts of other nutrients.Potatoes contain vitamin C, for example, and the orange varieties of sweet potatoes contain carotenoids. Yams con- tain many bioactive compounds and taro corms are high invitamin B6, fibr e, and manganese.70PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 4.1.3 Consumption patterns Cereals and grains As societies moved to more settled, agricultural ways of life 10-15 000 years ago, cereals became the main staple foods;the types of cer eal crops grown depended largely on climate and terrain . Wheat, barley , oats, and rye are traditionally sta- ple foods for people living in the Middle East and Europe; and with rice in Asia; maize (corn) in the Americas; and sorghum and millet in Africa. But the market for cereals and their products is now global, although some, such assorghum, r emain lar gely r egional. The importance of starchy staples in food systems and diets is broadly connected to economic and industrial devel-opment. Both in higher-income countries and across theworld, there has been a long-term decline in their con-sumption . With increasing urbanisation in lower-income countries, wheat and maize ar e replacing traditional staple foods. An important ex ception is Asia, wher e rice remains the staple grain. Cereal cultivation and consumption tends to be highest in most of Asia and lowest in Oceania, parts ofEurope, and North America. Globally, cereal foods provide more than 45 per cent of dietar y ener gy; diets based on these foods tend to be bulky with a low ener gy density (see chapter 8.8.4). Cer eals pr o- vide more than 50 per cent of dietary energy in low-income countries, but only around 30 per cent in high-income coun-tries. While grains contribute r oughly 20 per cent of dietar y energy in Australia, North America, and central Europe, they can provide as much as 70 per cent in parts of Asia (main-ly from rice). Although more wheat is grown than rice on a global basis, much of it is used for animal feed. Rice is the principal food for half of the world's population . Cereals ar e ver y versatile once they have been pr ocessed from the raw grain. Wheat is mainly milled to make flour for bread, pastries, cakes, and pasta. Maize (corn) is a sta-ple food in Latin America and parts of Asia and Africa, wher eit is used to make grits, cornmeal (used for polenta as well as corn breads), corn flour, tortillas, tamales, and corn chips.It is also the basis of corn starch (a thickener), corn syrup(a sweetner), and corn oils. Sweetcorn is also eaten as a veg-etable, either on or off the cob. Rice is usually processed toremove the bran and aleurone layers, turning 'brown rice' into ' white'. It is also used to mak e flour (the basis for gluten- free breads), rice powder, noodles, rice paper, rice milk, Japanese mochi, and lao-chao (Chinese fermented rice). Barley is used primarily in Asia (tsampa and miso soya paste) and in North Africa (soups, porridges, and flat breads).Whole r ye grains ar e milled and used to mak e bread in some north and east European countries. Whole oats are made into porridges and used in muesli and baked goods, such as biscuits. Fonio, millet, sorghum, teff, and triticale aretraditional crops and staples in parts of Africa and Asia.Many grains ar e also fermented to make alcoholic drinks (see chapter 4.8.1). Roots, tubers, and plantains Roots, tubers, and plantains are staple foods in some parts of the world. F or instance, populations in some regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Oceania base their diets on these foods. Globally , star chy roots provide around 5 per cent of dietar y ener gy. Consumption is high - est in the Pacific islands and parts of Africa, with cassava and yams providing more than 40 per cent of dietary energy inGhana. P otatoes can pr ovide as much as 10 per cent of dietary energy in North America and Europe. Globally, plan- tains provide less than 0.5 per cent of dietary energy, butthey are locally important in some African, Latin American, and Caribbean countries, where they can provide more than 15 per cent of dietar y energy. Some populations do not rely on any of these foods \u2014 for instance, pastoralist societiessuch as the Maasai hunters in East Africa, and the Inuit and other Arctic populations, maintain their traditional ways oflife and diets. Mycotoxins are toxins produced by certain moulds or fungi. Although moulds thatcontaminate foods are usually destroyed by cooking temperatures, the toxins they produce may remain. Aflatoxins are onetype of mycotoxin. All naturally occurring aflatoxins are classified as human carcino- gens (group 1) by the International Agencyfor Research on Cancer; other mycotoxins, such as fumonisins, are carcino- gens. 5It is common to find co-contamina- tion by more than one species of myco- toxin-producing fungus. In Europe, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on FoodAdditives and Contaminants recommends that aflatoxin concentrations in foods be kept as low as possible. 6 The main foods that may be contami- nated by aflatoxins are all types of cereal(grain), including wheat, rice, maize (corn), barley, and oats; and pulses (legumes) \u2014notably peanuts. Nuts and seeds may also be contaminated. Feedstuffs for farm ani- mals may also be contaminated with afla-toxins, which can then be secreted in milk or accumulated in tissues. Aflatoxins, which are produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus , are most problematic in countries with hot, damp climates and poor storage facilities.Under these conditions, foods may become contaminated with fungi and then accu- mulate such toxins. Such foods are mar-keted and consumed in the countries in which they are produced; they are also exported to neighbouring countries andintercontinentally. Aflatoxin contamina- tion is therefore a international issue. Levels of aflatoxin contamination tend to be highest in countries where rates ofliver cancer are high, such as some African countries and South-East Asia, including China. In general, rates are low in Europe,but relatively high rates of contamination have on occasion been found in the USA. Aflatoxin exposure levels are low in Europe and Australia, higher in the USA, and high in many low-income countries. This is particularly the case in tropical andsubtropical regions where grains and nuts are stored for long periods under non-ideal conditions. Rates are reduced by inspection, use of fungicides, and screening of imported foods. However, monitoring of levels ofaflatoxin contamination in low-income countries is generally lacking. Box 4.1.4 Aflatoxins71CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS Dietary fibre Dietary fibre intake, measured as non-starch polysaccharides, varies from 10-13 grams (g)/day in Japan and the UK to 15-20 g/day or more in Africa and India. Intake among indi-viduals in a population may vary between 7 and 25 g/day. 7 4.1.4 Interpretation of the evidence Interpretation of the evidence on any and all foods and drinks, their constituents, their methods of production, preservation, processing and preparation, and other factors, with the risk of cancer, is never simple, for general and spe- cific reasons. 4.1.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6, and 3.7. 'Relative risk' (RR) is used in this R eport to denote ratio measures of effect, considerations specific to cereals (grains), roots, tubers, and plantains are as follows. Classification . 'Cer eals' is a broad classification. Different cereals have differ ent nutritional composition and biological effects, as do different types of dietary fibre. Any effects of specific cer eals or their constituents may not become apparent. Patter ns and ranges of intake . Little evidence r elates to r oots, or tubers other than potatoes, or plantains, some of which, such as cassava (manioc) or yams, are staple foods in someparts of the world. Terminology . Potatoes are usually (as here) defined as tubers, but ar e sometimes (in the USA especially) included with veg- etables. Bananas, a significant item in many diets, may be(as her e) defined as a fruit, or else with plantains as a star chy food. There is no internationally agreed definition for dietary fibre (box 4.1.1). Measurement . Non-starch ch polysaccharides specifically than for dietary fibre. The various analytical techniques used to assess the fibre content of foods give widely different results. Confounding . In high-income countries, high intakes of wholegrain cereal products tend to go together with otherhealth-conscious dietary and other habits. Also there is pos- sible confounding between dietary fibre and other dietary constituents and in general with 'healthier ' dietary patterns and ways of life. Data on dietar y fibr e come pr edominantly from dietary sources, that is, plant-based foods (also see box 4.1.1 and chapter 4.2); therefore, no effect can be attributedto differ ent types and sour ces of dietar y fibre. Production, preservation, processing, preparation . Few stud- ies distinguish between unrefined and refined cereals and their products. Many processed foods grouped as cereal products, such as ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, are high inadded sugars and sometimes salt. The ways in which cere- als are processed, prepared, and consumed varies greatly in different cultures. 4.1.5 Evidence and judgements The full systematic literature review (SLR) is contained on the CD included with this Report. 4.1.5.1 Cereals (grains) The evidence was too limited in amount, consistency, or quality to draw any conclusions. 4.1.5.2 Roots, tubers, and plantains The evidence was too limited in amount, consistency , or quality to draw any conclusions. 4.1.5.3 Foods containing dietary fibre Colorectum Sixteen cohort studies and colorectal cancer. The Harvard pool-ing project also analysed original data from 13 separatecohort studies. 38 An association was appar ent fr om many, though not all, cohort studies. Ten studies showed decreased risk when com- paring high with low intak e groups,14 19 21 25-29 33 34which was statistically significant in one (figure 4.1.1).28Two reported non-significant increased risk,36 39one showed no effect on risk,30and one r eported no association .18One study r eport - ed non-significant decreased risk in women and non- significant increased risk in men23; one study reported non-significant increased risk in women and non-significantdecreased risk in men. 37Meta-analysis was possible on eight studies, giving a summar y effect estimate of 0.90 (95% con- fidence inter val (CI) moderate heter ogeneity (figur e 4.1.2). A dose-response relationship was apparent from cohort data. Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-contr ol studies were not summarised. The Harvard pooled analysis from 13 prospective cohort studies (725 628 participants, followed up for 6 to 20 years,8081 color ectal cancer cases) gave a significant inverse asso - ciation in the age-adjusted model (0.84, 95% CI 0.77-0.92). 38However, the association was attenuated and no longer statistically significant after adjusting for other risk factors (0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.03). One compari- son group was statistically significant when maximallyadjusted, others were not. Compared with dietary fibre intake of 10 to < 15 g/day, the pooled effect estimate was 1.18 (95% CI 1.05-1.31) for less than 10 g/day (low com - pared with moderate intak e). All other measur es wer e not associated with risk of colorectal cancer. The pooled analy- sis therefore found that, after accounting for other dietaryrisk factors, high dietar y fibr e intak e was not associated 72PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS with a r educed risk of colorectal cancer. Fibre exerts several effects in the gastrointestinal tract but the precise mechanisms for its probable protective role are not clearly understood. F ibre dilutes faecal contents, decr eas- es weight.40Fermentation products, especially short-chain fatty acids, are produced bythe gut flora fr om a wide range of dietar y carbohydrates that reach the colon. Short-chain fatty acids, particularly butyrate, can induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and pro-mote differentiation. Fibre intake is also strongly correlatedwith intake of folate. A clear dose-r esponse r elationship is apparent from generally consistent cohort studies, supported by evidence for plausible mechanisms, but residualconfounding could not be excluded. Foods containingdietary fibr e probably protect against colorectal cancer. The P anel is awar e that since the conclusion of the SLR, six cohort studies41-46and one case-contr ol study47have been pub - lished. This new information does not change the Panel judge- ment (see box 3.8). Oesophagus One cohort study,48nine case-control studies,49-58and two ecological studies59 60investigated dietary fibre and cancer of the oesophagus. There was some evidence of an association between dietary fibre and r educed oesophageal cancer risk. The single cohort study reported decreased risk when comparing high with low intakes, with an effect estimate of 0.50, though no assess-ment of statistical significance was included. 48The nine case-contr ol studies produced 13 independent effect estimates. Of these, 11 estimates wer e of decr eased risk,50-53 55 56 58 61which were statistically significant in eight. One estimate indicated no effect on risk54and one other gave non-significant increased risk.62The data were most consistent when stratified for adenocarcinomas; of sixstudies, five r eported significant decr eased risk; r esults wer e less consistent for squamous cell carcinoma. All studies were adjusted for alcohol and smoking except one, whichwas adjusted for alcohol but not smoking. 50 The ecological studies were inconclusive. Neither was sta- tistically significant, with one in the dir ection of increased and the other of decr eased risk. There is no evidence of a plausible biological mechanism through which dietary fibre reduces the risk of oesophageal cancer. It is not possible to conclude whether an as yetunknown mechanism is r esponsible for an apparent reduc- tion in risk, or whether it is due to other components found in the vegetables and fruits that contain dietar y fibr e. There is limited evidence from sparse and inconsistent case-control studies only, suggesting that foods containing dietary fibr e protect against oesophageal cancer. 4.1.5.4 Aflatoxins (Also see box 4.1.4; chapter 4.9; and chapter 7.8). There are two appr oaches to measuring aflatoxin intake. The first uses local food tables to estimate exposur e to aflato xins fr om diet. The second approach uses biomarkers of exposure. These are derived from knowledge of aflatoxin metabolism. In humans,metabolised pr oducts of aflato xins can be detected in blood, Figure 4.1.2 Dietary fibre and colorectal cancer; cohort 0.88 1999 Women 2001 Women 1.08 Men 1.02 (0.88-1.18) Men 5 1 0.2 0.5 2Relative risk (95% CI) Relative risk, per 10 g/day Figure 4.1.1 Dietary fibre and colorectal cancer; cohort studies Wu 1987 Men 1.19 (0.60-2.11) Wu 1987 Women 0.64 (0.37-1.11) Heilbrun 1989 Men Baron 1997 Women 0.79 (0.45-1.38) 5 1 0.2 0.5 2 Relative risk (95% CI) Relative risk, highest vs lowest exposure category73CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS urine, or breastmilk. Biomarkers of exposure are more accu- rate and precise. Liver Five cohort studies63-70and seven case-control studies71-79 assessed associations between biomarkers of exposure to aflatoxin and hepatocellular carcinoma. The cohort studies used a variety of different biomarkers for exposure to aflatoxin, some in blood and some in urine.Despite this variety, all five studies reported increased risk for the highest levels when compared to the lowest, and all of these reported at least one measure that resulted in a sta- tistically significant increased risk (figure 4.1.3). Studies that adjusted for hepatitis virus infection tended to show thegreater effects. 65 66There is some evidence of an interaction whereby the risk is increased by a multiplicative effect if afla-toxin exposure is combined with hepatitis infection. One study showed that people with hepatitis virus antibodies and biomarkers of aflatoxin exposure had a higher risk than thosewith hepatitis virus antibodies alone, with an effect estimate of 10.0 (95% CI 1.6-60.9). 65 There is evidence fr om some of the cohort studies for inter - action with glutathione- S-transferase (GST) genotype.63 64 GST is an enzyme involved in the metabolic pathway that 'detoxifies' aflatoxins. Different genotypes show varying effi-ciencies at this task. Two genes (GSTT1 and GSTM1) wereassessed separately. For each, it is possible to have a posi-tive or negative genotype. In each case, a negative genotypeincreases risk of hepatocellular car cinoma when exposed to aflatoxins. There is clear, consistent evidence that GSTM1/GST T1 positive genotypes pr otect against the increased risk of liver cancer from hepatitis infection com- bined with aflatoxin exposure, which supports a causal rolefor aflato xins in hepatocellular car cinoma. Four case-control studies showed statistically significant increased risk for the highest levels of biomarkers when com-pared to the lowest. 71 74 78 79Two studies showed no effect on risk.73 77One study showed a non-significant decreased risk.72Heter ogeneity may be explained by the diversity in methods of exposur e assessment. A dose-r esponse r elationship is apparent from most cohortstudies and some of the case-control studies. The areas in the world where there is considerable afla- toxin contamination of foods coincide with the areas where primary liver cancer rates are high. The epoxide product ofaflatoxin AFB 1is known to be genotoxic and is formed in the liver.80It damages DNA, causing G:C base pairs to become T:A. GST enzymes can repair this damage with varying effi- ciency between genotypes. Recent studies have shown that aflatoxins can damage the p53 gene, which is an importantregulator of normal growth. 67Damage to p53 DNA can lead to increased proliferation of abnormal cells and formation of cancers. The synergistic effect of hepatitis virus infection and afla- toxin exposure might be explained by hepatitis virus increas-ing the production of the enzyme (CYP1A2) that producesthe genotoxic metabolite of aflatoxin. 81It is also possible that the hepatitis virus increases the number of G:C to T:A trans- versions, or that it inhibits nucleotide repair, or that it acts as a tumour promoter. The evidence is ample and consistent and is supported by str ong evidence for mechanisms operating in humans. A dose response is apparent from both cohortand case-control studies. The evidence that aflatoxinsand aflatoxin-contaminated foods are a cause of livercancer is convincing. 4.1.6 Comparison with pr evious r eport The pr eport concluded that dietar y fibr e/non-starch protect against cancers of the pan- creas, colorectum, and breast. The previous report also con-cluded that wholegrain cer eals possibly decr ease the risk of stomach cancer and that refined cereals possibly increase the risk of oesophageal cancer. Since the mid-1990s, evidence for a protective effect of dietary fibre against colorectal and oesophageal cancer riskhas become somewhat str onger. The finding of the previous report, suggesting that the degr ee of refinement (other than relative amounts of dietar y fibre) may be a factor in modi- fication of the risk of some cancers, was not found. The previous report classified bananas as plantains. Here they ar e classified as fruits. The previous report considered dietary fibre separately from cereals (grains) and other plant foods. Her e, dietar y fibre is considered in the context of cere- als (grains) and other plant foods. 4.1.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The direct evidence that cereals (grains), roots, tubers, or plantains affect the risk of any cancer remains unimpressive. However , foods containing dietary fibre probably protect against color ectal cancer ; and ther e is limited evidence sug - gesting that such foods protect against oesophageal cancer. Dietary fibre is mostly found in cereals, roots and tubers, andalso in vegetables, fruits, and pulses (legumes) (see chapter Figure 4.1.3 Aflatoxins and liver cancer; cohort studies Qian 1994 Men 5.00 (2.11-11.85) Wang 1996 3.80 (1.11-12.96) Yu 1997 Men 6.00 (1.22-29.49) Sun 1999 Men 4.52 (1.57-13.01) 5 1 2 5 2 6 Relative risk (95% CI) Relative risk, highest vs lowest exposure category74PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 4.2). All of these are highest in dietary fibre when in whole or minimally processed forms. Foods high in dietary fibre may also have a protective effect indirectly because they are relatively low in energydensity. See chapters 6.1, 7.3, 7.9, and 8 for discussion of the role of energy density in weight gain, overweight, and obesity, and of weight gain, overweight, and obesity in the risk of some cancers, including those of the oesophagus and colorectum. The evidence that foods contaminated with aflatoxins are a cause of liver cancer is convincing. Cereals (grains) and peanuts (see chapter 4.2) are the foods most commonly infested by these fungal toxins. Contamination is most wide- spread in countries with hot, damp climates and poor stor-age facilities. 75CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS Vegetables and fruits are generally low in energy density (with a few exceptions) and, when consumed in variety,are sources of many vitamins, minerals, and other bioactive compounds (phytochemicals). Many non-starchy vegetables, including salad vegetables and fruits, may beeaten raw and may also be cooked. Pulses (legumes) arehigh in protein. Traditional diets all over the worldcombine cereals (grains) with pulses (legumes) and, inthis way, ensure sufficient protein of adequate quality, usually with small amounts of animal foods. Nuts and seeds are concentrated sources of numerousmicronutrients and of essential fatty acids. All these foods are sources of dietary fibre. Many herbs and spices havepotent pharmacological as well as culinary pr operties. Consumption of vegetables and fruits is very variable: high around the Mediterranean littoral and some tropicalcountries; low in many low-income countries, includingsome in which fruits are abundant. Consumption of pulses(legumes) is also very variable: beans and chickpeas andtheir pr oducts are basic foods in a number of Latin American, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries, but pulsesare insignificant in typical North American and mostEuropean diets. Consumption of nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices also varies. Traditional Middle Eastern and Indiancuisines use a great variety of herbs and spices; garlic,usually classified as a herb, is consumed in r emarkable quantities in some countries. In general, the Panel judges that findings from cohort studies conducted since the mid-1990s have made theoverall evidence, that vegetables or fruits protect againstcancers, somewhat less impr essive. In no case now is the evidence of pr otection judged to be convincing. However , in a substantial number of cases, a judgement of pr obable is justified. Evidence on legumes (pulses), nuts, seeds, and (with two exceptions) herbs and spices remainsinsubstantial. The P anel judges as follows: Non-star chy vegetables pr obably pr otect against cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx, and those of the oesophagus and stomach. There is limited evidence suggesting that they also pr otect against cancers of the nasopharynx, lung, colorectum, ovary, and endometrium. Allium vegetables probably protect against stomach cancer. Garlic (an allium vegetable, commonly classed as aherb) probably protects against colorectal cancer. There islimited evidence suggesting that carr ots protect against cervical cancer ; and that pulses (legumes), including soya and soya products, protect against stomach and prostate cancers. Fruits in general probably protect against cancersof the mouth, pharynx, and larynx, and those of theoesophagus, lung, and stomach. There is limited evidence suggesting that fruits also protect against cancers of thenasopharynx, pancreas, liver, and colorectum. There is limited evidence suggesting that chilli is a cause of stomach cancer. Fruits and non-starchy vegetables are generally low energy-dense foods. For a discussion of the effect of suchfoods and drinks on weight gain, overweight, and obesity,and the role of weight gain, overweight, and obesity in the risk of some cancers, see Chapters 6, 7, and 8. Evidence that vegetables and fruits protect against some cancers is supported by evidence on foods containingvarious micronutrients, found especially in vegetables,fruits, and pulses (legumes), and nuts and seeds, as wellas in cereals, roots, tubers, and other plant foods. Foodscontaining folate probably protect against pancreaticcancer, and there is limited evidence suggesting that thesefoods also protect against oesophageal and colorectalcancers. Foods containing carotenoids probably protectagainst cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx, lung cancer . Foods beta- probably protect against cancer; and foods containing lycopene pr obably pr otect against prostate cancer. Foods containing vitamin C probably protect against oesophageal cancer. There is limitedevidence suggesting that foods containing quer cetin protect against lung cancer. Evidence also relevant to chapter 4.1 is grouped here. Foods containing selenium (also found in animal foods)probably protect against prostate cancer; and there islimited evidence suggesting that they pr otect against stomach and color ectal cancers. Ther e is limited evidence suggesting that foods containing pyrido xine pr otect against oesophageal and prostate cancers; and that foods containing vitamin E protect against oesophageal andprostate cancers. The strongest evidence, here corresponding to judgements of 'pr obable', shows that non-star chy vegetables and also fruits pr obably pr otect against cancers of the mouth, larynx, pharynx, oesophagus, and stomach, and that fruits also probably protect against lung cancer; and that allium vegetables, and garlic specifically , probably protect against stomach cancer. The case that vegetables, fruits, and pulses (legumes) may be protective against cancers of some sites is supported by evidence onfoods containing micronutrients found in these and otherplant foods. Thus, foods containing car otenoids probably protect against cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and lung; foods containing beta-carotene and also vitamin C probably protect against oesophageal cancer; foodscontaining selenium and also Vegetables, fruits, pulses (legumes), nuts, seeds, herbs, spices76PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS VEGETABLES,1FRUITS,1PULSES (LEGUMES), NUTS, SEEDS, HERBS, SPICES, AND THE RISK OF CANCER In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer.

Also seechapter 4.1 for the evidence that foods containing dietaryfibre, found in plant foods (particularly when in whole orrelatively unprocessed forms), probably protect againstcolorectal cancer. Vegetables and fruits (including berries), nuts and seeds, and herbs and spices, where they grow and can be cultivated, have always been part of human diets. Gatherer-hunters and pastoral peoples probably consumed more than relatively impoverished urban dwellers: for them, vegetables were the main sources of many vitamins, and fruits were a mainsource of energy, from sugar (also found in wild honey).They are consumed abundantly as part of many long-estab-lished traditional cuisines, around the Mediterranean littoral, the Middle East, in many Asian countries, and the Pacific islands, where substantial amounts of meat, dairy products,and other animal foods ar e traditionally consumed only occa - sionally. In contrast, monotonous 'poverty' diets include few of these foods. Globally, consumption of these foods is lower than now generally recommended. Vegetables and fruits are sometimesseen as relatively expensive. Well stocked supermarkets usu-ally now display a variety of local and imported fresh veg-etables and fruits, although supplies in smaller stores aremore variable. Consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits in many tr opical countries in Africa and Latin America is low : on average people in Brazil, for example, consume roughly the same as people in Britain . The explanation may be that in Africa, many rural communities are obliged to grow cash crops that displace gardens, and that in Latin America knowl-edge of the value \u2014 and pleasur e \u2014 of many indigenous vegetables and fruits has been lost. Many programmes in tropical countries are now dedicated to regaining this knowl-edge. 1 Even before the discovery of vitamins as essential nutri- ents beginning in the early 20th centur y, vegetables and fruits have been r ecommended as 'pr otective foods'. Early reports concerned with nutritional deficiencies paid less attention to pulses (legumes), nuts, and seeds, even though these plant foods contain protein, and nuts and seeds arenutrient- and also ener gy-dense, perhaps because they are not much consumed in the countries where most such reports wer e compiled. Instead, as already mentioned, pri- ority was given to ener gy- and nutrient-dense foods of ani - mal origin. By the 1980s, most reports concerned with prevention of chronic diseases recommended relatively highintak es of vegetables and fruits and sometimes also pulses (legumes), either because these foods were seen as nour- ishing substitutes for energy-dense fatty or sugary foods, orelse because they were identified as positively protective against cardiovascular disease. 2Evidence that vegetables and fruits might be pr otective against some cancers emerged in the 1990s.3A common r ecommendation has been for at least five portions (or at least 400 g) of vegetables and fruits a day.4 Non-star chy r oot vegetables such as carr ots are includedhere. Chapter 4.1 includes dietary fibre, only found naturally in plant foods. Chapter 4.1 also includes aflatoxins, which also contaminate pulses (legumes), notably peanuts, nuts and seeds, and other plant foods. The micronutrients includ-ed here, as contained in vegetables, fruits, pulses (legumes), nuts and seeds, are also found in other plant foods, and some also in animal foods. 4.2.1 Definitions, sources Vegetables and fruits are defined in this Report by their culi- nary use, and are grouped for discussion below as vegeta- bles and fruits, pulses (legumes), nuts and seeds, and herbs,spices, and condiments. Vegetables and fruits Vegetables are the edible parts of plants, usually including fungi. Typical examples include cultivated or gatheredleaves, r oots, stalks, bulbs, and flowers. Some foods ar e culi - nary vegetables but are classified botanically as fruits; these include cucumbers, peppers, squash, and tomatoes. Non- starchy vegetables are included here, while starchy root veg- etables are considered in chapter 4.1. Non-starchy vegetablescan be further divided into green, leafy vegetables, such asspinach and lettuce; cruciferous vegetables (the cabbagefamily), for example, bok choy, broccoli, cabbage, and water-cress; and allium vegetables, such as onions, garlic, and leeks. A fruit is the seed-containing part of the plant; but only those that ar e eaten as fruits ar e included in the culinar y def- inition, for example, apples, bananas, berries, figs, grapes, mangoes, and melons. This also includes citrus fruits suchas oranges, grapefruits, lemons, and limes; and also driedfruits, such as apricots, figs, and raisins. Pulses (legumes) Leguminous plants produce their fruits as pods and are con- sidered here separately. The dried, edible seeds of this fam- ily ar e often called pulses, although this term is used interchangeably with legumes. They include beans, lentils, peas, and peanuts (groundnuts). The dried forms, which have matured and dried on the plant, are eaten most wide-ly. But some varieties are eaten as a green vegetable, such as peas; the pods are sometimes eaten like this too, for exam- ple, gr een beans and runner beans. Some legumes can also be spr outed (germinated) and eaten , such as beanspouts. Nuts and seeds Nuts ar e edible seeds surr ounded by a tough, dr y shell. This definition includes true nuts (such as hazelnuts and chest- nuts), as well as seeds that most people think of as nuts(including Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, and cashews). Other seeds commonly eaten include sunflower, sesame, pumpkin, and poppy seeds. Nuts and seeds ar e processed for their oil, ground into pastes, used as ingr edients, or eaten raw or roasted as snack foods. Cereals (grains) are also the seeds of plants, but these are discussed separately in this Report(see chapter 4.1). Seeds, lik e nuts, have a r elatively high oil 78PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS content, and the oils produced from them are considered in chapter 4.4. Herbs, spices, and condiments Herbs and spices, which are generally used to flavour or pre- serve foods, are of plant origin, although a very small num- ber of animal pr oducts are classed as spices (such as amber gris). Definitions of herbs and spices var y, but herbs are usually the fresh or dry leaves or whole plant, while spices are produced from other parts of the plant, such asthe seeds, and ar e usually dried. 5Many differ ent parts ofplants are used as herbs or spices, such as the leaves (sage, bay, or basil), stems (ginger , lemongrass), bark (cinnamon), rhizomes (ginger), roots (horseradish), flower buds (cloves), stamens (saffron), seeds (mustard, cumin), kernels (nut-meg), and fruits (peppers). A condiment is a substance that adds taste to other foods; the term is often used for sauces added at the table, whichare usually of plant origin . Examples include vinegars, ketchups, chutneys, harissa, mustard, and soy sauce. Salt is neither a herb nor a spice, although it is used as a condiment(see chapter 4.5). Vegetables, fruits, pulses (legumes), nuts, and seeds are sources of a wide variety ofmicronutrients and other bioactive com- pounds. Foods containing several of these constituents have been identified in the sys- tematic literature reviews, on which this chapter is based, as being associated withcancer risk. These are carotenoids (includ- ing beta-carotene and lycopene), folate, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, quercetin,pyridoxine, and selenium. Mechanisms by which they might affect cancer risk are dis- cussed in chapter 4.2.5. However, it is notpossible to ascribe the association between these foods and lower cancer risk to a causal effect of specific compounds withconfidence, as each food contains a com- plex mixture of different constituents, all of which might also contribute to any effect. Carotenoids are found in varying con- centrations in all vegetables, particularly those that are red or orange. They are afamily of mor e than 600 fat-soluble red/orange pigments that xan- be conver ted by the body to retinol and are sometimes called pro-vitamin A carotenoids. Thesecompounds tend to be the main dietarysource of vitamin A in low-income coun - tries. Only about half of the 50 or so carotenoids in human diets can be absorb-ed. They have antioxidant and other bioac - tivities that ar e discussed in chapter 4.10. Sources of carotenoids include spinach, kale, butter nut squash, pumpkin, red (bell) peppers, car rots, tomatoes, cantaloupe melon, and sweet potatoes. Beta-carotene is found in yellow, orange, and green fruits and green, leafy vegeta-bles including carrots, spinach, lettuce,tomatoes, sweet potatoes, broccoli, can- taloupe melon, oranges, and winter squash (pumpkin). As a rule of thumb, the greater the inten- sity of the colour of the fruit or vegetable,the more beta-carotene it contains. The most concentrated source of lycopene is tomatoes, but it is also present in watermelon, red (bell) peppers, pink or red grapefruit, pink-fleshed guava, andpersimmons. The B-vitamin folate is a family of com- pounds essential for human health. Folicacid, the synthetic form, is used to fortify manufactured cereal products, spreads, and, in some countries, flour or grains.Folates are involved in a number of meta- bolic pathways, especially in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, which areimportant for DNA synthesis and cell repli- cation (also see chapter 4.2.5.4). Sources of dietary folate include liver, beans, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, chicory, oranges, and papaya. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-solu- ble vitamin. Humans, like a small number ofother animals, cannot synthesise vitamin C,so it is an essential part of diets. Vitamin Cis essential for collagen synthesis and alsohas antioxidant activity. Severe deficiencycauses scur vy. It is added to many foods, including bread and soft drinks, in small amounts as an antioxidant preservative.Natural dietary sources are vegetables,tubers, and fr ed/yellow (bell) peppers, kiwi fruits, broccoli, papaya, citrus fruits, strawberries, and potatoes, butit is destroyed by heat or contact with theair (for instance, when vegetables ar e chopped), or lost into cooking water . Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin and a potent antioxidant that occurs as eight dif - ferent forms: alpha- and gamma-toco- pher ol are the most common. The most important dietary sources of vitamin E arevegetable oils such as palm, sunflower,corn, soya bean, and olive oils. Nuts, sun-flower seeds, and wheatgerm are also sources. Wholegrains, fish, peanut butter , green, leafy vegetables, and fortifiedbreakfast cereals also contain this vitamin. Pyridoxine is one of a group of water- soluble compounds collectively known as vitamin B6. This vitamin is involved in neu- rotransmitter synthesis, red blood cell for- mation and function, niacin (vitamin B3) formation, steroid hormone function, andnucleic acid synthesis (also see chapter 4.2.5.5). 15Food sources include bananas, fish, poultry, liver, potatoes eaten with theskin, green, leafy vegetables, beans, pulses (legumes), nuts, wholegrains, and fortified breakfast cereals. Selenium is a mineral element that occurs in different chemical forms. It is toxic in large amounts, but is essential inthe diet at trace levels. It is present at vary- ing concentrations in different soils; and since plants take up selenium from the soil, these levels determine the amount present in vegetables. Thus selenium deficiency is more prevalent in regions where the soilselenium content is low . Selenium is a com - ponent of the amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine, which are inte-grated into pr oteins to selenopro- which is importantfor DNA synthesis, and iodothyronine deio-dinase, which is important for the synthe-sis of thyr oid hor mones. 16Dietar y sour ces of selenium include brazil nuts, fish, whole- grains, wheatgerm, and sunflower seeds. Quercetin is a flavonoid, which is a type of polyphenol; it is not an essential dietar y component. Many studies in cultur ed cells and animals suggest that quercetin has antioxidant activity , which could give rise to a range of biological activities, including reducing inflammation (also see chapter 4.2.5.9). Quercetin is found in apples,green and black tea, onions, raspberries,red wine, red grapes, citrus fruits, leafy,green vegetables, cherries, blueber other bioactive compounds and cancer risk 79CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS 4.2.2 Composition Vegetables and fruits The composition of fruits and vegetables depends both on species and on subtype, as well as on the envir onmental, farming, production, and storage conditions. These include factors such as sun exposure, soil quality, agricultural prac-tices, harvesting time, ripeness, length of time between har-vest and consumption, and preservation and preparationmethods. For instance, the outer leaves of lettuces can have higher levels of some micronutrients than the inner leaves; and harvested, unripe fruit that ripens in transit may have lower levels of nutrients than fruits ripened on the plant (box 4.2.1). 6 Vegetables and fruits contain vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre, and other bioactive compounds, such as phytochemi- cals (box 4.2.2). This is a collective term for a variety of plant components that often perform important functions in theplant, such as providing colour, flavour, or protection, but are not essential in the human diet. They include salicylates, flavonoids, glucosinolates, terpenes, lignans, and isoflavones. All of these groups of compounds have been shown either in humans or in laboratory experiments to havepotentially beneficial health effects when they are includedin diets. However, the bioavailability of these compounds is variable (box 4.2.3) and their ultimate heath effects uncertain. Plant cell walls are the main source of dietary fibre, and all whole fruits and vegetables (but not their juices) contain varying amounts of fibre (box 4.2.4). Most vegetables andfruits ar e low ener gy-dense foods, although ther e are excep- tions, for example, avocados, nuts, and seeds. Some families of fruits and vegetables have characteristic components that may confer a particular health benefit (orrisk) to the whole family. For instance, cruciferous vegeta-bles are sources of glucosinolates and their products isoth-iocyanates and indoles. Allium vegetables and others, suchas chicor y and Jerusalem artichok es, store energy as inulin (chains of fructose sugars) rather than starch (chains of glu- cose sugars). The body cannot digest inulin , which is called a prebiotic \u2014 a substance that is claimed to have health ben- efits by promoting the growth of certain types of gut bacte-ria. Allyl sulphides and allicin in garlic ar e distinctive flavour molecules that give vegetables of the onion family their 'sting' (box 4.2.3). Green, leafy vegetables are sources offolate, and tomatoes have high levels of lycopene. All ofthese components, as well as other phytochemicals (box Plants contain a wide range of biologically active compounds, some of which are known as phytochemicals. There may be as many as 100 000 different compounds, which determine par- ticular properties in plants, and in the fruits and vegetables they produce, such as flavour and colour. Phytochemicals are classi-fied according to their chemical structure and functional acteristics, is widely believed that the health benefits of diets high in fruits and vegetables are likely to be due partly to the presenceof phytochemicals. For instance, several act as antioxidants, pre- venting oxidative damage to cells, proteins, and DNA. It is like- ly that other bioactive phytochemicals have yet to be identified,and those that are known may have additional properties in the body that are not yet understood. But it is thought that nutri- ents, phytochemicals, and other, as yet unknown, bioactive com-ponents act together to influence physiological responses. Although many phytochemicals are bioactive, they are not essential in the diet and there is no daily requirement, so they are not classed as nutrients. Humans have developed tastes forsome phytochemicals, such as the hot flavours of mustar d oil, bitter alkaloids, and irritating capsaicins. There is genetically inherited variation in sensitivity to some tastes, for example, thebitter taste of isothiocyanates in cruciferous vegetables such ascabbage.Box 4.2.2 Phytochemicals While some vegetables, often termed 'salad vegetables', are commonly eaten raw, many ar e cooked before they are eaten. In most cases, whether a vegetable is eaten raw depends on personal choice. Most forms of cooking reduce the total nutrient content of vegetables, although the degree to which this happens varies between nutrients and with cooking meth-ods. However, cooking also increases the bioavailability of some nutrients. 12 Ther efore, although raw vegetables have higher amounts of nutrients overall, the body may absorb mor e of a nutrient fr om the cooked vegetable. For instance, carotenoid absorption in the small intestine is relatively inefficient (5-50 per cent); the bioavailability ofcarotenes is increased by cooking and pureeing vegetables, particularly by adding oil, because these compounds ar e fat soluble.13Similarly, processing tomatoes increases the bioavailability of lycopene, another carotenoid: it is four times more bioavailable from tomato paste than from fresh tomatoes. Thus processed tomato products such as pasteurised tomato juice,soup, sauce, and ketchup provide the most bioavailable lycopene. Cooking and cr ush- ing tomatoes (as in the canning pr ocess) and including them in oil-rich dishes (such as pasta sauce or pizza) gr eatly incr eases lycopene absorption fr om the digestive tract. The biological response to garlic can also be influenced by the way that it isprocessed. Peeling and chopping garlic releases an enzyme, alliinase, which is known to pr omote the for mation of some sulphur compounds that are not only odor- iferous but may provide some health ben- efits. Heating garlic without peeling inactivates this enzyme and has been found to substantially reduce or eliminate the active properties. If garlic is peeled orchopped and allowed to stand for 15-20 minutes, the active agents that ar e for med are not destroyed by normal cooking pro- cedures. 14 The ways in which vegetables and fr uits are produced and stor ed may af fect nutri - ent levels as much as cooking, or more. For example, nutrient levels tend to fall rapid- ly after harvest. Box 4.2.3 Preparation of vegetables and nutrient bioavailability80PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 4.2.2), have been shown to have potentially beneficial effects in laborator y experiments, as detailed in the evidence in chapter 4.2.5 (also see Chapter 2).7-9 Pulses (legumes) Dry pulses are seeds and are higher in protein than most other plant foods. Soya beans and peanuts contain 37 g per100 g and 26 g per 100 g pr otein dr y weight respectively, although, on average, pulses contain ar ound 20 g per 100 g protein dry weight. 10These foods are typically high in car- bohydrates and non-starch polysaccharides (dietary fibre),and ar e generally low in fat. Soya beans and peanuts are exceptions, being relatively high in fat with 8 g per 100 g and 47 g per 100 g fat, r espectively (mostly mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids). They also contain oligosac - charides that are not digested in the gut but are fermented by bacteria in the colon. Soya beans are distinct from otherlegumes in that they have a high content of bioactive isoflavones, or phytoestrogens, which have hormone-like effects in the body. They are also good sources of saponinsand phytosterols, which decrease cholesterol absorption. Many legumes contain deguelin, which has been shown to have anti-tumour effects in laborator y experiments. 11Most pulses ar e virtually indigestible and inedible befor e cooking; immature legumes that are eaten green have higher levels of sugar and lower levels of non-digestible polysaccharidesthan dried pulses.Nuts and seeds Other seeds and nuts are also relatively high in protein and fat; some contain as much as 60 g fat per 100 g. They are therefore energy-dense foods (see Chapter 8), as well asbeing nutrient-dense. Weight-for-weight, nuts provide more calories than either meat or cereals (grains), although chest- nuts are the exception as they are relatively low in fat. Most nuts contain mainly monounsaturated fatty acids, although the exceptions are coconuts, which contain a high propor-tion of saturated fatty acids, and walnuts and pecans, which contain mostly polyunsaturated fatty acids (see chapter 4.5.2). Nuts and seeds are high in dietary fibre (box 4.2.4), especially when they are eaten with their skins or hulls; the fibre content is typically 5-11 g per 100 g. Nuts and seedsare also high in vitamins and minerals, particularly the B vit-amins, vitamin E, and folate; and the seed coats contain phe-nolic compounds. Herbs and spices Nearly all herbs and spices contain ar omatic compounds, which are volatile molecules that are usually fat- rather than water -soluble. The flavour compounds may mak e up as much as 15 g per 100 g of a spice by weight, although herbs con- tain much lower levels \u2014 typically around 1 g per 100 g.Many plants have evolved to contain these compoundsbecause they act as deterrents to herbivores. Some of thesearomatic compounds may be bioactive, although possibly notat the levels found in most diets. Isothiocyanates ar e respon- sible for the spicy/hot flavour mustar d and horseradish, produced from glucosinolates in cruciferous plants. Chives and garlic (allium vegetables) contain the distinctive sul - phides discussed above. Terpenoids are common components in herbs and spices, providing distinctive flavours. Examplesinclude monoterpenes, such as geranial in lycopene. 4.2.3 Consumption patter ns Fruits and vegetables The global average for vegetable consumption (based on availability and not including vegetable oils) is 2.6 per cent of total daily ener gy intak e.17It is generally highest in North Africa, the Middle East, parts of Asia, the US A and Cuba, and in southern Europe. Although consumption levels are similar in countries of high and low economic status, vegetables rep-resent a gr eater pr oportion of daily ener gy intake in the low- income countries. Intakes range from 5.3 per cent in parts of Asia to as little as 0.2 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. On aver-age, the availability of vegetables is increasing globally. The global average for fruit consumption (based on avail- ability) is 2.7 per cent of total daily ener gy intake. Fruit con- sumption is generally higher than vegetable consumption , but it shows a greater degree of variability. Fruit consump- tion is higher in high-income countries, although it repre-sents a similar per centage of total available dietar y ener gy The concept of dietary fibre arose from observations of the low prevalence of colon cancer, diabetes, and coronary heart disease in parts of Africa amongst people whose diets were high in unrefined carbohydrates and whose stools were typically bulky, and often or sometimes semisolid. Considerable efforts have been dedicated to characterising the dietary components of what has come to be called dietary fibre that might confer health benefit. Naturally occurring dietary fibre is only derived from plant foods. Pulses (legumes) and minimally processed cereals are particularly concentrated sources, but vegetables and fruits also contain significant amounts. Dietary fibre isolated from plant cell walls and synthetic forms are increasingly enter- ing the food supply. High intakes of dietary fibre, variously defined, have been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease as well as of some cancers. Definitions of dietary fibre vary. Some arebased on chemical analyses of the components of plant cell walls, such as non-starch polysaccharide, others on physiologi- cal effects \u2014 the carbohydrates that enter the large bowel hav- ing escaped digestion in the small intestine being defined as dietar y fibr e. The latter definition includes oligosaccharides and resistant starch. The World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have recently proposed that only poly-saccharides which form part of plant cell walls should be regard-ed as dietar y fibr e and that the health benefits of r esistant starch and oligosaccharides are more appropriately considered separately.Box 4.2.4 Foods containing dietary fibre This box also appears as box 4.1.2 in the previous section81CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS to that seen in low-income countries. Intakes are highest in some parts of Africa, the Middle East, southern Europe, and Oceania, and lowest in other parts of Africa and Asia. Fruit consumption also tends to be low in north-eastern Europe.Intakes range from as much as 20 per cent of daily energy in parts of Africa to as little as 0.5 per cent in parts of Asia. The availability of fruit has increased globally in recent decades, although there was a slight decrease in the 1990s. Most countries have national recommendations for the daily amount of vegetables and fruits that need to be eaten to maintain optimal health (Chapter 10). These vary, but they tend to recommend three or more servings per day of vegetables and two or more servings per day of fruits; a serv- ing is about 80 g (or half a US cup). In most high-incomecountries for which data were available, daily consumptionof vegetables fell short of this target, although this is not dueto lack of availability; indeed, availability is high due to the wide use of refrigeration. Fruit consumption tended to be closer to national targets. Seasonal availability influencesoverall availability , although less so in high-income countries where vegetables and fruits are more likely to be imported. Pulses (legumes) Globally, pulses supply 2 per cent of total energy intake (based on availability) and 3.5 per cent of daily proteinintake. 17The highest availability is in parts of Africa, South America, Asia, and the Middle East. In these areas, pulsesare a dietary staple, and can account for as much as 20 per cent of daily ener gy intak e and 50 per cent of protein intake. In societies with high intakes of meat and other foods of ani- mal origin , pulses ar e less important in diets, and ar e usu - ally consumed infrequently or in small amounts. Peanuts and soya beans account for most of the legume products eatenaround the world. Soya bean availability per person represents 0.5 per cent of daily energy intake globally, but it is notably high in partsof Asia, and higher than average in parts of Africa andCentral America. In parts of Asia, soya beans account for upto 4.9 per cent of daily ener gy availability and 15 per cent of protein . Pulses ar e eaten in a variety of ways ar ound the world; for instance, Japanese and Chinese bean curd (tofu), Chinese mung bean sprouts, Mexican chilli and refried beans, Indiandahl, falafel hummus, Indonesian cul - tured soya bean cakes (tempeh), Cuban black beans and rice, Boston bak ed beans, F rench cassoulet, Brazilian feijoada, Swedish pea soup, and US peanut butter . Soya beans ar e par - ticularly versatile and their products are a common feature in manufactured foods, although they are not commonlyeaten whole. Soya foods include soya drinks and flour , tofu, tempeh, textured vegetable protein, and the many products that can be prepared from these foods. Fermented soya beansproduce soy sauce and miso. Soya bean oil is also used wide- ly (see chapter 4.5.3). Nuts and seeds Nuts and seeds were an important part of human diets before the advent of agriculture and they remain locally importantin a few ar eas. Globally , tree nuts supply 0.4 per cent of dailyenergy availability. The highest availability is in the Middle East and parts of Europe, and the lowest is in South America and parts of Africa; intakes range from 3 per cent of total energy in parts of the Middle East to virtually zero in manylow-income countries. Coconuts represent 0.5 per cent of daily energy availabil- ity globally, although coconuts can be locally important in tropical islands, for instance in parts of Oceania, Asia (Sri Lanka and Indonesia), the Caribbean, and in the Africanislands. In parts of Oceania, for example, coconuts provide as much as 20 per cent of energy in the diet. Sunflower, rape, mustard, and sesame seeds together sup- ply 0.2 per cent of daily energy intake globally. There are fewer data available for seeds than for many other foods,although sesame seed intake is relatively high in parts ofAfrica and Asia, providing a maximum of 3.9 per cent ofenergy in parts of central Africa. Oils from seed crops are widely used (see chapter 4.5.3). Herbs, spices, and condiments Although spices are consumed in small amounts to flavour food, they ar e such a r egular featur e of some diets that they account for a measurable quantity of daily energy intake. Worldwide, spices provide 0.3 per cent of available dietaryenergy and in parts of Asia they constitute as much as 1.8per cent. Herbs and spices tend to be part of the tradition-al diet in the areas from which they originate, and many tra-ditional cuisines ar e characterised by the use of herbs, spices, and condiments. Most ar e now available worldwide, although their use still varies greatly in different parts of the world. Many herbs and spices ar e believed to have medici - nal or tonic value and have been used in this way at least since the times of the earliest medical records. Many mod-ern pharmaceuticals ar e derived fr om herbs and other plants. Many herbs and some spices are biologically very potent: the modern pharmacopoeia lists drugs, many of which havebeen isolated from herbs, sometimes known as 'plants withhealing powers'. There are some in vivo experimental datafor potentially beneficial effects in the cases of turmeric, saf - fron, ginger, pepper, garam masala (a herb and spice mix), and also eugenol and myristin , constituents of a number of herbs and spices. Conversely, it is at least theoretically possible that some condiments have adverse effects. T wo examples are hot chilli juices and harissa, a fiery condiment; both are consumed in substantial quantities in Mexico and the Mahgr eb countries of North Africa, r espectively , and both irritate the mouth and throat. 4.2.4 Interpretation of the evidence 4.2.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapter 3.3 and 3.5, and bo xes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' (RR) is used in this Report to denote ratio measures of effect, 4.2.4.2 Specific Considerations specific to vegetables, fruits, pulses (legumes), nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices include: Patterns and ranges of intake . Most studies of consumption of vegetables, fruits, and pulses (legumes) have been con- ducted in populations that have relatively homogeneous diets. The limited data on nuts, seeds, herbs, spices, and condiments come mainly from a few human case-controlstudies and some experimental animal studies. Classification . There is no general agreement on classifica- tion. Some studies have included cereals such as corn, and tubers such as potatoes, as vegetables, and plantains as fruit.Broccoli and green peppers are included as 'green vegetables'in some studies, while only leafy greens are included in thiscategory in others; tomatoes are considered 'yellow-orange vegetables' in some but not in others. Some studies report results only for broad categories (for example, 'all vegetables'or 'all fruits'), wher eas others have r eported r esults for mor e narrowly defined categories (for example, 'raw vegetables', 'green vegetables', 'citrus fruits') example, 'spinach', 'carrots', 'tomatoes'). In some stud- ies, vegetables and fruits have been categorised according tobotanical classification; in others, categorisation has beenaccording to culinary usage. In this report, the terms 'veg-etables' and 'fruits' are used according to their culinary def-inition . Some studies have included pulses as vegetables wher eas others have classified these as a separate entity or not at all. Many older studies have not differentiated between r etinol and car otenoids. Vitamin E intak es are dif- ficult to quantify since much comes from the vegetable oils used in food preparation, and intakes within populations areusually homogenous because of the widespr ead occurr ence of vitamin E in commonly consumed foods. Measurement . Assessment of selenium intake is problemat- ic because the content of selenium in foods depends to alarge extent on the soil selenium content of the area in which the foods wer e grown. Blood and toenail levels of selenium are thought to be fairly accurate indicators of intak e and have been used in several studies. Confounding . Smok ers consume fewer vegetables and fruits than non-smokers.18 19Fat intake inversely correlates with vegetable and, particularly , fruit intak e in the USA.20Recent studies of the effects of fruits and vegetables in cancersthought to be caused by smoking have controlled for the effect of smoking. Folate intake is correlated with intake ofnon-star chy polysaccharide (dietar y fibr e). Reporting bias . Studies using self-reporting tend to over- report vegetable and fruit consumption. Where an effect exists, results from such studies are liable to underestimate the extent to which vegetables and fruits modify the risk ofcancer . 4.2.5 Evidence and judgements The full systematic literature review (SLR) is contained on the CD included with this Report. 4.2.5.1 Non-starchy vegetables Mouth, fruits; case-control studies investigated raw vegetables24 27 28 33 36-43 45 47 50 58-65; 1 cohort study,6614 case-control studies,24 26-29 39 61 67 69investigated cohort studies66 70 71and 18 case-control studies23 24 39 41-43 46 49 50 63 65 72-75investigated carrots; and 1 cohort study66 and 12 case-control studies26-29 39-43 46 50 58 62 65investigated tomatoes. Non-star chy vegetables Most studies showed decreased risk with increased intake of non-starchy vegetables. Twenty-two studies reported com-parisons of high against low intake (figure 4.2.1). 22 23 25 26 29- 31 33 35-46 49 50Of these, 19 showed decreased risk for the highest intake group,22 25 26 30 31 33 35-44 46 49 50which was sta- tistically significant in 13.22 25 30 31 35 37 38 40 42 43 46 49 50The other 3 studies showed non-significant incr eased risk.23 29 45 Figure Stefani 2005 0.60 (0.33-1.10)Relative risk (95% CI) Relative risk, highest vs lowest exposure category15 0.2 0.5 283CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS The remaining studies showed no consistent association, probably due to varying exposure definitions and study design.21 24 27 28 32 34 47 48Meta-analysis was possible on 4 case- contr ol studies, giving a summar y effect estimate of 0.72 (95% confidence inter val (CI) 0.63-0.82) per 50 g/day , with moderate heterogeneity (figure 4.2.2). All studies adjusted for sex, smoking, and alcohol consumption. A dose-r esponse r elationship is appar ent fr om the four case-control studies that could be meta-analysed (figure 4.2.3). There is some suggestion that the greatest effectappears to be with the first increment. That is, any increase above the lowest levels of vegetable consumption confers a protective effect. However, it is not clear that the effect con- tinues in a linear fashion with incr eased dose. Of the three ecological studies, one (Hong Kong) study found a significant negative association between vegetableconsumption and cancer incidence 51; the other two(international) found no significant association with cancer mortality.52 53 Non-starchy vegetables and fruits A cohort study that reported results for non-starchy vegeta- bles and fruits in combination reported a statistically signif- icant protective effect in the highest consumers (0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.95).54All six case-control studies looking at the same exposure group reported reduced risk estimates in sim-ilar comparisons, 33 39 45 55-57which were statistically signifi- cant in four.33 39 55 57All of these studies adjusted for smoking and alcohol consumption. Raw vegetables Twenty-three case-control studies reported separate risk esti- mates for raw vegetable consumption.24 27 28 33 36-43 45 47 50 58- 65All of these reported comparisons of risk between high and low intake groups, which produced reduced risk estimates in 2224 27 28 33 36-43 45 47 50 58 60-65; 16 of these were statistical- ly significant.24 33 36-40 42 43 47 50 60-63 65No studies r eported sta - tistically significant increased risk estimates. Meta-analysis of 7 case-contr ol studies gave an effect estimate of 0.71 (95% CI 0.59-0.86) per 50 g/day, with moderate heterogeneity.37 39 42 45 59 62 65These studies also provided evidence of a dose- response relationship. The heterogeneity could be partiallyexplained by variable exposure definitions. These results areconsistent with data for non-starchy vegetables. Crucifer ous vegetables One cohort study,6614 case-control studies,24 26-29 39 41 43 45- 47 50 63 67and 1 ecological study68reported separate risk esti - mates for cruciferous vegetable consumption. The single cohort study showed a non-significant increased risk for incr eased intak e of cauliflower and a non-significant decreased risk for cabbage.66Four case-control studies showed statistically significant decreased risk with increasedintake, either overall or in specific subgroups. 24 29 43 47One study showed statistically significant increased risk associ-ated with eating kimchi or pickled cabbage. 67The other nine studies showed inconsistent and non-significant associa - tions.26-28 39 41 45 46 50 63The ecological study showed a sta - tistically significant decreased risk.68 Green, leafy vegetables One cohort study66and 10 case-control studies24 26-29 39 47 61 67 69reported separate risk estimates for gr een, leafy veg- etable consumption . The single cohort study showed no effect for the highest intake group of lettuce when compared to the lowest.66Nine case-contr ol studies showed decr eased risk with incr eased intake,24 26 27 29 39 47 61 67 69which was statistically significant in four.24 39 61 69One study showed non-significant increased risk.28 Carrots Three cohort studies66 71and 18 case-contr ol studies23 24 There wasvariation in the exposur e classification in studies.

Tomatoes One cohort study66and 12 case-contr ol studies26-29 39-43 46 50 58 62 65investigated tomatoes and mouth, larynx, or pharynx cancers. The cohort study reported a non-significant increased risk when comparing the highest intake group against the low-est, with a wide confidence interval (1.7, 95% CI 0.8-3.7). 66 Of the 12 case-contr ol studies,26-29 39-43 46 50 58 62 6510 report- ed reduced risk estimates,26 29 39-43 46 50 58 62 655 of which wer e statistically significant.26 29 39 40 62Only 2 reported an increased risk, which was non-significant.27 28These studies were also the only studies not to adjust for both smoking and alcohol intake. The general mechanisms thr ough which vegetables could plausibly protect against cancers of the mouth, larynx, and pharynx are outlined below. Although all of the studies mentioned here adjust for smoking behaviour and nearly all adjust for alcohol, the rel-ative risk of smoking is lar ge (particularly when combined with alcoholic drinks). It is ther efore difficult to eliminate confidently the possibility of r esidual confounding with ways of life associated with smoking: for instance, smokers con- sume fewer vegetables than non-smokers. A substantial amount of consistent evidence on non- starchy vegetables, including specific subtypes, mostly from case-contr ol studies, shows a dose-r esponse relationship. There is evidence for plausible mechanisms. Non-starchy vegetables probably protect against mouth, pharynx, and larynx cancers.

This exposure category could be less disparate than other vegetable groupings, as it is clear that preserved vegetables are not included and variation in cooking methods is removed. This may account for the lack of heterogeneity in direction of effect in this subcategory of vegetables.

There is more evidence, including on vegetable subtypes, from case-control studies than from cohortstudies, but both are moderately consistent and there is some evidence for a dose-response relationship.There is evidence for plausible mechanisms. Non-starchy vegetables probably protect againstoesophageal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort140and two case-control studies78 143have been pub- lished.

A substantial amount of evidence is available, including on specific subtypes, particularly green-yellow vegetables, with a dose-r esponse r elationship in case-control, but not cohort data. There is evidence for plausible mechanisms. V egetables pr obably pr otect against stomach studies272-276and two ecological studies51 277investigated non-starchy vegetables and nasopharyngeal cancer ; a further four case-control studies investigated green vegetables.278-281Preserved vegetables were excluded from all categories. Eight of the case-contr ol studies r eported r educed risk when comparing high against low intake groups,272 273 275 276 278-281which was statistically significant in three of the non- starchy vegetable studies272 275 276and in two of the gr een vegetable studies.279 280One other study stated that there was no significant association.274All studies were based in China. The ecological studies produced mixed results. One showed significant correlations between the consumption of fresh vegetables and reduced risk of nasopharyngeal car- cinoma after adjusting for age (r 2= -0.77, p = 0.009 among men and r2= -0.75, p = 0.013 among women).51The second study showed an increasing risk with increases in local consumption of non-starchy vegetables (r2= 2.36).277 This study did not r eport any adjustments for potential confounding variables or whether the finding was signifi- cant. The general mechanisms thr ough which vegetables could plausibly protect against nasopharyngeal cancer are outlined below. The evidence for non-starchy vegetables is sparse but generally consistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that non-starchy vegetables protect againstnasopharyngeal cancer. Lung Seventeen cohort studies,282-30027 case-control and 6 ecological studies52 116 332-335investigated total veg- etables and lung cancer (some studies did not separate non-starchy vegetables from this grouping); in addition, there was 1 relevant pooling project publication.336Three cohort studies337-339and 1 case-control study321investigated non- starchy vegetables 292 340 341and 17 case-control studies65 301 307 312 320-322 326 330 342-350 investigated green, leafy vegetables (excluding cruciferous); 2 cohort studies investigated non-starchy root vegetables and tubers289 299 control 313 320-322 325-327 342 344 346-348 351-358 and 1 ecological study333investigated carrots specifically.

Carrots All six cohort studies reported reduced risk,285 289 293 299 339 341 which was statistically significant in one (0.4, p value for trend 0.003).341The other , non-significant, risk estimates ranged from 0.61 to 0.82.285 289 293 299 339 Twenty of the 21 case-control studies showed decreased risk when comparing high against low intake groups,65 261 304 307 313 321 322 325-327 342 344 346-348 351-358which was statistically significant in 8.261 304 321 325 327 346 347 351 353 356-358One study reported no effect.320Meta-analysis on studies that adjusted for smoking was possible on 11 studies, giving a summar y effect estimate of 0.81 (95% CI 0.73-0.89), per serving/day increment, with high heterogeneity.65 307 313 322 325-327 347 348 351 352 354-357 There was some evidence of publication bias for both cohort and case-contr ol studies.

A substantial amount of evidence is available but some studies were not adjusted for smoking. A dose-response relationship is apparent from both cohort andcase-contr ol studies. There is limited evidence suggesting that non-star chy vegetables pr otect against lung cancer.Colorectum Seventeen cohort studies81 359-379and 71 case-control studies investigated non-starchy vegetables and colorectal cancer. Of 20 effect estimates from 17 cohort studies that report- ed comparisons of the highest and lowest intake groups, 11 were in the direction of reduced risk,81 362 364 366 371-374 376-378 3 of which were statistically significant.81 366 371 377One study showed non-significant decreased risk in women and non-significant increased risk in men. 360The other 8 reported non-significant increased risk.359 361 363 365 367-370 375One study stated that there was no significant association.379Meta- analysis was possible on 9 independent estimates from 6 studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.00 (95% CI0.90-1.11) per 2 servings/day increment, with moderate tohigh heterogeneity. 360 362-364 366 370 Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. The general mechanisms through which vegetables could plausibly pr otect against color ectal cancer ar e outlined below. A substantial amount of evidence is available but it is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting thatnon-starchy vegetables protect against colorectalcancer. The P anel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, three case-contr ol studies78 261 380have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box3.8). Ovary Five cohort studies,381-385eight cohort studies381-383and two case- control studies395 396investigated green, leafy vegetables. Non-star chy vegetables All of the cohort studies r eported decr eased risk with increased vegetable consumption .381-385Meta-analysis was possible on four cohort studies, giving a summary effect esti- mate of 0.64 (95% CI 0.33-0.97) for an increase of one serv-ing/day , with no heterogeneity. 381 383-385The study that could not be included reported an effect estimate of 0.76 (95% CI 0.42-1.37) for the highest intak e group when compared with the lowest.382 Pooled analysis from 12 cohort studies (over 560 000 par- ticipants, followed up for 7 to 22 years, more than 2100 lungcancer cases) showed a non-significant r educed risk when comparing high against low intake groups (0.90, 95% CI 0.78-1.04), with a p value for trend of 0.06. 397 All of the case-control studies reported reduced risk,89 386-392which was statistically significant in five.89 386 387 391 392 One ecological study r eported a non-significant positive regression/corr elation between continents393and the other reported a negative regression/correlation between countries.394 92PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Green, leafy vegetables All three cohort studies reported decreased risk with increased green, leafy vegetable consumption.381-383Meta- analysis was possible on two cohort studies, giving a sum-mary effect estimate of 0.96 (95% CI 0.88-1.03) per two servings/day, with no heterogeneity. 381 383The third cohort study reported a statistically significant reduced risk (0.44, 95% CI 0.25-0.79) when comparing the highest and lowest intake groups.382 Both case-control studies reported reduced risk from increased consumption of green, leafy vegetables,395 396one of which was statistically significant.396 The general mechanisms through which vegetables could plausibly protect against ovarian cancer are outlined below. Evidence from cohort and case-control studies is sparse. There is limited evidence suggesting that non- starchy vegetables protect against ovarian cancer. The P anel is awar e that since the conclusion of the SLR one case-control study78has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement (see bo x 3.8). Endometrium Ten case-control studies investigated non-starchy vegetable consumption.398-407Seven cruciferous vegetables and endometrial cancer.398-400 405 407-410 Of the 10 studies that r eported on non-starchy vegetables, 7 showed decr eased risk when comparing the highest with the lowest intake groups,400-405 407which was statistically other showed no effect on risk.399 Meta-analysis was possible on 8 studies, giving a summary estimate of 0.90 (95% CI 0.86-0.95) per 100 g of vegetableintake/day, with low heterogeneity. 399 401-407A dose-response relationship was apparent from these data. Five out of the seven case-control studies that investigat- ed cruciferous vegetables reported reduced risk when com-paring high to low intak e groups, 399 405 407-410which was statistically significant in one.405The other two studies reported non-significant incr eased risk.398 400Meta-analysis was possible on five studies, giving a summary effect esti- mate of 0.79 (95% CI 0.69-0.90) per 100 g/day, with no het-erogeneity. 399 405 407 409 410The two studies that could not be included suggested increased risk, though not statistically significant.398 400 A dose-r esponse r elationship is appar ent fr om case-contr ol data. The general mechanisms through which vegetables could plausibly pr otect against endometrial cancer ar e outlined below. Cruciferous vegetables contain glucosinolates. Certain hydrolysis products of glucosinolates, including indoles andisothiocyanates, have shown anti-carcinogenic properties in laboratory experiments and in diets in live experiments in animals. 411The human genotype of glutathione S-transferase has been shown to have a significant r ole in the metabolism of these phytochemicals and may therefore influence poten- tial anti-cancer properties.412Evidence comes from case-control studies only. There is limited evidence suggesting that non-starchyvegetables protect against endometrial cancer. General mechanisms \u2014 non-starchy vegetables Also see Chapter 2. Non-starchy vegetables provide a pletho- ra of potentially cancer-preventive substances, including sev- eral antioxidant nutrients (such as carotenoids and vitamin C), dietary fibre, as well as phytochemicals flavonoids, allylsulphides, cancer risk through their antioxidant activities, modulation of detoxification enzymes, stimulation of the immune system, antiproliferative activities, and/or modula-tion of steroid hormone concentration and hormone metab-olism, to name a few possible mechanisms. Non-starchyvegetables are also a source of folate, which plays an impor- tant role in synthesis and methylation of DNA. Abnormal DNA methylation has been linked to aberrant gene expres-sion and also to cancers at several sites, and may be partic - ularly important in rapidly dividing tissues. It is difficult to unravel the r elative importance of each constituent and lik e- ly that a protective effect may result from a combination of influences on several pathways involved in carcinogenesis. Carrots are a source of carotenoids, particularly alpha- carotene and beta-carotene, as well as other vitamins andphytochemicals with potentially protective effects. Tomatoesare a source of vitamin C and carotenoids, particularly lycopene. P otential mechanisms of inhibition include ligand-dependent ough r etinoid r eceptors (see chapter 4.2.5.3). There is a complex mixture of phytochemicals present in whole vegetables and these may have additive and syner-gistic effects r esponsible for anti-cancer activities. vegetables Stomach Two cohort studies,413 41427 case-control studies,109 129 152 162 164 171 178 182 185 187 191 194 195 232 243-245 247 248 251 266 270 415-419and 2 ecological studies202 208investigated allium vegetables and stomach cancer ; 1 cohort study ,41316 case-contr ol studies,109 129 182 184 195 232 246 247 251 262 418 420-422and 2 ecological studies203 208investigated garlic and stomach cancer. There was also 1 relevant intervention study that combined allitridium and selenium supplements.423 424 Allium vegetables Both cohort studies reported decreased risk,413 414which was statistically significant in one.413Meta-analysis was possible on both, giving a summar y effect estimate of 0.55 (95% CI 0.35-0.87) per 100 g/day, with no heterogeneity (figure 4.2.14).413 414 Twenty of the case-control studies showed reduced risk when comparing high with low intake groups,129 152 162 164 171 178 182 185 187 191 194 195 232 243 247 248 270 416 418 419which was sta - tistically significant in 12.129 152 162 164 182 187 194 243 248 270 416 418 Four studies showed increased risk,109 245 266 415which was sta- tistically significant in 2,245and the remaining 3 reported no significant effect on risk.244 251 417Meta-analysis was possible 93CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS on 14 studies, giving a summar y effect estimate of 0.59 (95% CI 0.47-0.74) per 100 g/day, with high heterogeneity (figure 4.2.14).109 129 152 162 171 178 182 187 191 194 232 247 270 416 Both ecological studies r eported statistically significant decreased risk with increased consumption.202 208 A statistically significant dose-response relationship is apparent from cohort and case-control data. Garlic The single cohort study , which was specific to supplemen - tary garlic, showed a non-significant incr eased risk when comparing garlic supplement use versus no supplement use (1.29, 95% CI 0.62-2.67).413 Fifteen of the case-control studies showed decreased risk when comparing highest to lowest intake groups,109 129 182 184 195 232 246 247 251 418 420-422which was statistically significant in seven .129 182 232 246 247 418 420 422One study showed a non- significant increased risk.262Meta-analysis was possible on five studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 0.41 (95% CI 0.23-0.73) per ser ving/day . 109 129 182 232 421 One ecological study showed statistically significant decreased risk with increased intake208; the other showed no significant association.203 Inter vention study The double-blind, randomised trial had an inter vention dura - tion of 3 years, and a 5- and 10-year follow-up, and more than 5000 participants, all of whom had been identified asbeing at incr eased risk of stomach cancer . The inter ventionwas a combined selenium/allitridium supplement. 423 424The 5-year follow-up suggested that the intervention was effective in reducing stomach cancer incidence in men (0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.92) but not in women (1.14, 95% CI0.22-5.76). 423The statistically significant protective effect for men had dissipated at the 10-year follow-up.424(Also see chapter 4.2.5.8.) Allium vegetables are high in flavonols and organosulphur compounds. They also, particularly garlic, have antibioticproperties. Although this may act directly against H pylori (a known cause of stomach cancers), a study in humans has not shown this effect.425It is also possible that antibacteri- al effects of garlic might inhibit the secondary colonisation of the stomach after H pylori -induced atrophy. At present, there is no evidence to support or refute this mechanism. Ananimal study provides evidence that dietary garlic can reducethe severity of H pylori -associated gastritis.426 The evidence, though not copious and mostly from case-contr ol studies, is consistent, with a dose- response relationship. There is evidence for plausiblemechanisms. Allium vegetables pr obably pr otect against stomach Garlic Two cohort studies361 362and six case-control studies427-435 investigated consumption . Both cohort studies r eported non-significant decr eased risk when comparing the highest with the lowest intake groups, with effect estimates of 0.77 (95% CI 0.51-1.16)361and 0.68 (95% CI 0.46-1.01) (figure 4.2.15).362 All six case-control studies showed decreased risk for the highest consumers of garlic,427-435which was statistically sig - nificant in three (figure 4.2.16).431 432 There is considerable preclinical evidence with model car- cinogens and transplantable tumours that supports an anti-cancer effect of garlic and some of its allyl sulphurcomponents. Animal studies demonstrate that allyl sulphideseffectively inhibit colon tumour formation and also caninhibit cell owth in the laborator y. 436-439 Figure 4.2.14 Allium vegetables and stomach and Dorant 1996 (0.71-1.16) Summary estimate 0.59 (0.47-0.74)Relative risk (95% CI) Relative risk, per 100 g/day120.5 Figure 4.2.15 Garlic and colon cancer; cohort studies (0.51-1.16) Steinmetz 1994 Women 0.68 (0.46-1.01)Relative risk (95% CI) Relative risk, highest vs lowest exposure category15 0.2 0.5 294PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS The evidence, though not copious and mostly from case-contr ol studies, is consistent, with a dose- response relationship. There is evidence for plausiblemechanisms. Garlic probably protects againstcolorectal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-contr ol study78has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement (see bo x 3.8). In addition to this judgement, data on garlic have contributed to the evidence base for allium vegetables and stomach cancer (also see chapter 7.5). 4.2.5.1.2 Carrots Cervix Five case-control studies440-444and one ecological study445 investigated carrots and cervical cancer. Case-contr ol studies were consistent in showing reduced risk for the highest levels of consumption , which was sta - tistically significant in thr ee.440-442All studies used hospital- based controls and none adjusted for human papilloma virus status. The single ecological study showed non-significantincreased risk with high intake of carrots. 445 Some carotenoids, including beta-carotene and alpha- carotene, which ar e found at high levels in carrots, are pre- cursors of vitamin A . They also have pr operties independent of their pro-vitamin A activity. Carotenoids are recognised antioxidants and low blood levels of dietary antioxidants areassociated with human papilloma virus persistence. 446 The evidence, from case-control studies only, is sparse but consistent. There is limited evidence suggestingthat carrots protect against cervical cancer. Data on carr ots have contributed to the evidence base for non-starchy vegetables and mouth, pharynx, and larynx can- cers (chapter 7.1) and lung cancer (chapter 7.4). Also seechapter 4.2.5.1.4.2.5.2 Fruits Mouth, pharynx, and 30-33 35 36 39-50 59-61 63 64 67 69 72 74 448-450and 2 ecological studies52 68 investigated fruits and mouth, pharynx, larynx cancers; and 1 cohort 63 65 75 451 452and 1 ecological study52investigated citrus fruits. In addition, 1 cohort study54and 6 case-control studies33 39 45 55-57investigated non-starchy vegetables and fruits in combination (also see evidence on non-starchy vegetables, chapter 4.2.5.1). General fruits The single cohort study, which adjusted for smoking, showed a non-significant decreased risk for the highest whencompared to the lowest intake groups, with an effect esti-mate of 0.82 (95% CI 0.64-1.04) (figure 4.2.17). 447 Most (32) of the case-control studies reported decreased risk associated with higher intake of fruits,24-26 28 30-33 35 36 39- 48 50 59-61 63 64 69 72 74 448 450which was statistically significant in 17.26 31 32 35 39-43 46-48 50 63 64 69 72 448No study reported sta- tistically significant incr eased risk. Meta-analysis was possi - ble on 7 studies (all of which adjusted for smoking), giving a summary effect estimate of 0.72 (95% CI 0.59-0.87) per100 g/day, with high heterogeneity (figure 4.2.17). 30 39 42 44 45 69 72Heterogeneity came from the varying size, not direc- tion, of effect. One ecological study showed a weak inverse corr elation between fruits and oral cancer .68The other obser ved inverse correlations among women for fruit and both oral and laryn- geal cancers and positive corr elations among men for the same two sites.52 Figure 4.2.17 Fruits and mouth, pharynx, and larynx and Summary estimate (0.59-0.87)Relative risk (95% CI) Relative risk, per 100 g/day1 0.75 0.1 0.5 1.5 Figure 4.2.16 Garlic consumption and colorectal cancer; case-control studies (0.04-0.98) 0.83 (0.44-1.55)Relative risk (95% CI) Relative risk, highest vs lowest exposure category15 0.2 0.5 295CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS Citrus fruits The single cohort study , which was specific to oranges and was adjusted for smoking, showed a non-significantdecreased risk for the highest when compared to the lowest intake groups, with an effect estimate of 0.50 (95% CI0.30-1.00), with a p value for tr end of 0.03. 66This risk esti - mate was for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract. Twenty-two of the case-control studies showed decreased risk associated with higher intake of fruits,23 27-29 31 33 34 37-39 41-43 45-47 50 63 75 451 452which was statistically significant in 13.23 27-29 31 33 37 39 42 43 47 50 75The 23rdstudy showed no effect on risk.26Meta-analysis was possible on 7 studies (all of which adjusted for smoking), giving a summary effect esti- mate of 0.76 (95% CI 0.66-0.87) per 50 g/day, with highheter ogeneity (figur e 4.2.18). 23 29 37 39 42 45 65Heter ogeneitycame from the varying size, not direction, of effect. A dose-response relationship was apparent from case- contr ol but not cohort data for both general and citrus fruits (figur es 4.2.19 and 4.2.20). Ther e is some suggestion that the greatest effect appears to be with the first increment. That is, some fruit consumption confers a pr otective effect compared to none. However, it is not clear that the effect continues in a linear fashion with increased doses. One ecological study found no significant association between citrus fruit consumption and cancer mortality inmen or women. 52 Studies that reported on combined intake of non-starchy vegetables and fruits showed evidence of an association withdecreased risk (see chapter 4.2.5.1). The general mechanisms thr ough which fruits could plau - sibly pr otect against mouth, pharynx, and larynx cancer are outlined below. The evidence, including on fruit subtypes, though mostly from case-control studies, is consistent, with adose-r esponse r elationship. There is evidence for plausible mechanisms.

In addition, flavonoids found in fruit directly inhibit expression of CYP1A1 (a cytochrome P450 enzyme that helps to metabolise toxins), resulting in decreased DNA damage.475 Elevated CYP1A1 activity has been associated with increased risk of lung cancer, primarily in smokers.476The protective association of flavonoids is associated with specific CYP1A1 genotypes, which supports the importance of flavonoids and potentially explains heterogeneous results.476 477 The evidence is ample and consistent. A dose-response relationship is apparent from both cohort and case- control studies and there is evidence for plausible mechanisms operating in humans. The evidence thatfruits pr otect against lung cancer is convincing. The P anel is awar e that since the conclusion of the SLR , one case-control study478has been published.

The evidence is ample and more consistent with a dose-response relationship for case-control studiesthan for cohorts. There is evidence for plausiblemechanisms.

Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. The mechanism for this sex difference is unknown. There is speculation the mechanism could be related to the (part- ly understood) explanation for protective effects observed in postmenopausal women provided with hormone replace-ment therapy. Another possibility is that the result could be artifactual if men are poorer at reporting their diets than women. The general mechanisms through which fruits could plau- sibly protect against colorectal cancer are outlined below. There is a substantial amount of evidence but it is inconsistent.

General mechanisms \u2014 fruits Fruits, in particular citrus fruits, are sources of vitamin C and other antioxidants, such as phenols and flavonoids, as wellas potentially bioactive phytochemicals. Vitamin C traps fr ee radicals and r eactive o xygen molecules, protecting against oxidation damage. It also regenerates other antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin E. 534Vitamin C also inhibits the formation of carcinogens and protects DNA from mutagenic attack.535 Beta-car otene and other car otenoid antio xidants ar e also found in fruits. Some fruits contain high levels of flavonoids, including apples (quercetin) and grapefruit (naringin).Flavonoids have antioxidant effects and can also inhibitcarcinogen-activating enzymes. Flavonoids can also alter themetabolism of other dietar y agents. For instance, quercetin expr ession CYP1A1 in decreased DNA damage. 475The phytochemical antioxidants contained in fruit could reduce free-radical damage gener-ated by inflammation . A single study reported that apples given in physiological quantities inhibited carcinogen- induced mammar y cancer in r odents in a dose-response manner . 536 There is a complex mixture of phytochemicals present in whole vegetables and these may have additive and syner-gistic effects r esponsible for anti-cancer activities. 4.2.5.3 Foods containing carotenoids Mouth, larynx dietar y carotenoids and mouth, phar ynx, and lar ynx cancers.

Both case-control studies of serum or plasma lycopene showed a statistically significant reduced risk for the high-est intake groups when compared to the lowest. 596 619 Lycopene is most bioavailable from cooked and pureed tomatoes. The best measur es of systemic exposure are there- fore studies on tomato sauce, particularly of cumulative con - sumption, or on serum or plasma lycopene. The Panel also gave emphasis to studies on advanced or aggr essive cancers, which may be better linked to prognosis than studies that include early stage or latent disease, or screening-detecteddisease. The general mechanisms through which foods containing carotenoids, including lycopene, could plausibly protectagainst prostate cancer are outlined below. In addition,amongst the common carotenoids, lycopene is thought to bethe most efficient antio xidant in the body. 631 There is a substantial amount of consistent evidence, in particular on tomato products, from both cohort and case-control studies. There is evidence for plausiblemechanisms. F oods containing lycopene probably protect against prostate cancer.

General mechanisms \u2014 foods containing car otenoids Carotenoids are antio xidants, which can pr event lipid o xi- dation and related oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induced by free radicals causes DNA damage. Base mutation, single-and double-strand br eaks, DNA cr oss-linking, and chr omo- 106PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS somal breakage and rearrangement can all occur if this ini- tial damage is left unrepaired. This damage could plausibly be prevented or limited by dietary antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables.675 Many of the carotenoids, including beta-carotene, are also retinoid (vitamin A) precursors. The pro-vitamin A carotenoids may be converted to retinol where they function in cellular differentiation, immunoenhancement, and acti- vation of an antiproliferative effect, reduces plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, improves immune function, and reduces inflammation. 4.2.5.4 Foods containing folate Foods naturally containing folates are vegetables, fruits, and liver, but increasingly foods such as breakfast cereals are for- tified with folic acid. Pancr eas Three om foods and/or supplements, and pancreatic cancer. One cohort study reported a statistically significant reduced risk for the highest intake groups (without specify-ing the source of folate) when compared to the lowest 677; one reported no effect on risk in men678and the other reported a non-significant incr eased risk in women.678Meta-analysis was possible on all thr ee cohort studies, giving a summar y effect estimate of 0.94 (95% CI 0.80-1.11) per 100 \u00b5g/day, with high heter ogeneity .677 678 When these results were stratified according to dietary or supplemental folate, this heterogeneity was removed. Twocohort studies r eported non-significant decreased risk; meta-analysis waspossible on both, giving a summary effect estimate of 0.86(95% CI 0.73-1.00) per 100 \u00b5g/day, with no heterogeneity(figure 4.2.33). All three cohort studies reported separatelyon supplemental folate, 677 678 In addition , one of the cohort studies included a nested case-control study investigating blood folate levels. This reported a statistically significant decreased risk for the high-est levels when compared to the lowest, with an effect esti- mate of 0.45 (95% CI 0.24-0.82).680 The Panel is aware of an additional cohort study, published after the conclusion of the literature review, which showeda statistically significant decreased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the lowest. 681The effect estimate was 0.25 (95% CI 0.11-0.59) for dietary folate and 0.33 (95% CI 0.15-0.72) for total folate (combining dietary and supplemental sources). No association was observed withfolate supplements only. One of the case-control studies reported a statistically sig- nificant reduced risk for the highest intake groups when com- pared to the lowest. 679The other reported a non-significant decreased risk in women and no effect on risk in men.509 The ecological study showed a statistically significant decreased risk in areas of high folate intake.515 The possible differential effect between folate from foods and from supplements could be explained by folate serving as a marker for fruit and vegetable intake, by a differentmetabolic effect of the folic acid in supplements, or by con - founders associated with supplement use. The general mechanisms thr ough which foods containing folate could plausibly protect against pancreatic cancer are outlined below. The evidence available is sparse but a dose-response relationship was apparent from cohort studies. There islimited evidence suggesting that foods containingfolate pr otect against pancr eatic cancer. The P anel is awar e that since the conclusion of the SLR , one cohort study681has been published.

A published meta-analysis of seven cohort studies and nine case-contr ol studies r eported a statistically significant decreased risk of colorectal cancer for the highest dietary folate intake when compared to the lowest (0.75, 95% CI0.64-0.89). 697 The general mechanisms through which foods containing folate could plausibly protect against colorectal cancer areoutlined below . In addition, folate intake is also strongly cor- related with intak e of dietary fibre, which probably prevents colorectal cancer (also see chapter 7.1). The evidence from cohort studies is plentiful, with a dose-response relationship, but there is unexplainedinconsistency . Residual confounding fr om dietary fibr e is possible. There is limited evidence suggesting that foods containing folate protect against colorectal cancer.

This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). General mechanisms \u2014 foods containing folate Also see Chapter 2. Folate plays an important role in the syn- thesis and methylation of DNA.703Abnormal DNA methyl- ation leading to aberrant gene expression has been demonstrated in several types of cancer. Folate deficiency may produce misincorporation of uracil instead of thymineinto DNA. The effects of folate deficiency and supplemen- tation on DNA methylation are gene- and site-specific, and appear to depend on cell type, target organ, stage of trans- formation, and degree and duration of folate depletion. Animal studies have shown that dose and timing of folate intervention are critical in determining its effect: excep-tionally high folate doses, and intervention after the forma-tion of microscopic neoplastic foci, may promote rather than suppress colorectal carcinogenesis, at least in the animal models studied. 704 There is a known interaction between folate and alcohol and the risk of some cancers. 4.2.5.5 Foods containing pyridoxine (vitamin B6) Oesophagus Six doxine and oesophageal cancer.88 125 548 583 585 587 All six studies showed decreased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the lowest,88 125 548 583 585 587which was statistically significant in four .88 125 583 585All studies adjusted for alcohol and five adjusted for smoking. Together with folate and cobalamin (B12), vitamin B6 is involved in one-carbon metabolism and thus is important for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation. The evidence, from case-control studies only, was sparse. There is limited evidence suggesting thatpyridoxine protects against oesophageal cancer.

It traps free radicals and reactive oxygen mol- ecules, pr otecting against lipid per reducing nitrates, and stimulating the immune system.586 709Moreover, it can recycle other antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin E.534 Vitamin C has also been shown to inhibit formation of car - cinogens and protect DNA from mutagenic attack.535 However, evidence supporting a specific mechanism in the oesophagus is limited.586 A substantial amount of consistent evidence is available, fr om both cohort and case-contr ol studies.

Vitamin E has also been shown to inhibit the growth of human prostate tumours induced inmice. 726 The evidence, mostly from case-control studies, was inconsistent. Ther e is limited evidence suggesting that foods containing vitamin E pr otect against pr ostate cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies632 633have been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement (see bo x 3.8). General mechanisms \u2014 foods containing vitamin E Vitamin E is an antioxidant that has been reported to pre- vent DNA damage, enhance DNA repair, prevent lipid per-oxidation, and prevent activation of carcinogens such as nitrosamines. Vitamin E pr otects vitamin A and selenium in the body . In addition to acting as a fr ee-radical scavenger, vitamin E enhances the body's immune response, which may play a role in cancer defences. 727 4.2.5.8 Foods containing selenium Data fr om selenium levels in serum or nails can be inter - preted mor e robustly than dietar y data because they ar e less prone to certain sources of error; serum data are a short-term reflection of intake; levels in nails are cumulative and reflectlong-term intak e. It is not possible to rule out residual confounding between selenium levels and healthy lifestyles. Individuals with high-er selenium levels may be more likely to be following sev- eral strategies to improve their health, including taking supplements. It is plausible that an effect attributed to selenium could only be apparent in areas of selenium deficiency. Lung Two cohort studies,288 ecological stud- ies,570 serum selenium; three cohort studies747-749 investigated selenium levels in nails. Dietary selenium One cohort study showed non-significant decreased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest.464 One cohort study showed non-significant increased risk in non-smokers and non-significant decreased risk insmokers. 288Both case-control studies showed a non-signifi- cant increased risk for the highest intake group when com-pared to the lowest. 469 557One ecological study showed statistically significant decreased risk in high-intake areas,728 the other showed no consistent association.729 Plasma or serum selenium Seven cohort studies showed decr eased risk for the highest selenium levels when compared to the lowest,463 575 731-734 736-738which was statistically significant in two.733 737Four showed increased risk,577 730 735 738which was statis- tically significant in two.735 738Meta-analysis was possible on four cohort studies, giving a summary effect estimate of0.969 (95% CI 0.940-0.999) per 10 577 731 733 736 Six case-control studies showed decreased risk for the highest levels when compar ed to the lowest,570 739-743which was statistically significant in four.739 740 742 743One study showed non-significant increased risk.571 One ecological study showed statistically significant decreased risk in areas of high plasma selenium729; the oth- ers showed no consistent effect.729 744-746 Nails Two cohort studies showed decreased risk for the highest selenium levels when compar ed to the lowest,748 749which was statistically significant in one.749One study showed non- significant increased risk.747 The general mechanisms through which selenium could plausibly pr otect against lung cancer are outlined below. The evidence available is sparse. Ther e is limited evidence to suggest that foods containing seleniumprotect against lung cancer.

The effect estimate was 0.66 (95% CI 0.44-0.98) per 50 \u00b5g/day.713This study did not adjust for confounders. Two case-control studies showed non-significant decreased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the low- est751 752; five showed increased risk,599 601 639 715 716one of which was statistically significant.715Meta-analysis was pos- sible on three studies, giving a summary effect estimate of1.07 (95% CI 0.92-1.25) per increase in 50 \u00b5g/day, with no heterogeneity. 599 601 639 The two ecological studies reported that increasing selenium intake was associated with decreasing prostate cancer levels.729 753 754 Serum or plasma selenium Eight cohort studies that investigated serum or plasma sele- nium showed decreased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the lowest,652 732 755-759 761 763 764which was statistically significant in two . Four r eported non-significant increased risk.730 760 762 765Meta-analysis was possible on nine of these studies, giving a summar y effect estimate of 0.95 (95% CI 0.89-1.00) per 10 \u00b5g/l, with moderate hetero- geneity (figure 4.2.36).732 755 757 758 761 762 764 765 Two of these 12 cohort studies reported separately on advanced/aggressive cancer.730 755 758Both showed decreased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the low-est, which was statistically significant in one. 758Meta-analy - sis was possible on both, giving a summar y effect estimate of 0.87 (95% CI 0.79-0.97) per 10 \u00b5g/l, with no hetero- geneity (figur e 4.2.37).755 758 A dose-response relationship is apparent from the studies on advanced or aggressive disease (figure 4.2.38). All four of the case-contr ol studies showed decr eased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the low- est,716 741 752 766 767which was statistically significant in three.741 752 767Nails Two cohort studies investigated selenium levels in nails for all prostate cancer. Both showed non-significant decreased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the low-est. Meta-analysis was possible on both studies, giving a sum- mary effect estimate of 0.91 (95% 0.81-1.02) per 100 ng/g, with moderate heterogeneity. 724 768 Two cohort studies investigated selenium levels in nails for advanced or aggressive prostate cancer. Both showed statis-tically significant decreased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the lowest. Meta-analysis was possible on both studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 0.80 (95% 0.69-0.91) per 100 ng/g, with no heterogeneity. 615 768 One case-control study showed non-significant decreased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the low-est, 770one showed no effect on risk717and the other showed a non-significant increased risk.769 The single ecological study reported a non-significant asso- ciation.771 These data ar e supported by data on supplements, which have been shown to decrease prostate cancer risk (see chap- ter 4.10.6.4.5).

The low to moder- ate heterogeneity observed for other outcomes and different study types may be explained by the variable inclusion of latent cancers in the outcome and by variations in studyquality. The general mechanisms through which foods containing selenium could plausibly protect against prostate cancer are outlined below. In addition, selenoproteins are involved in testosterone production, which is an important regulator ofboth normal and abnormal prostate growth. 774 775 The evidence from cohort and case-control studies is consistent, with a dose-response relationship. There isevidence for plausible mechanisms. Foods containingselenium probably protect against prostate cancer. Stomach One case-control study776and five ecological studies238 729 777- 779investigated dietary study787and one case-contr ol study788 investigated selenium in toenails or hair. In addition, one randomised controlled trial and one combined trial investi-gated selenium supplements. 423 424 Dietary selenium The single case-contr ol study showed that dietary selenium was not significantly associated with risk of stomach cancer.776 Most ecological studies showed that low selenium levels were associated with increased stomach cancer risk,238 777-779 one of which was statistically significant.779 Blood selenium All three cohort studies that investigated blood selenium lev- els showed decreased risk for the highest levels when com-pared to the lowest, 731 732 736which was statistically significant in men in one study .732Meta-analysis was possi - ble on all thr ee, giving a summar y effect estimate of 0.89 (95% CI 0.78-1.00) per 0.1 \u00b5mol/l, with moderate hetero- geneity.731 732 736 All nine case-control studies showed statistically significant decreased risk for the highest levels when compared to the low- est.738 741 754 780-785Meta-analysis was possible on six of these, giving a summar y effect estimate of 0.44 (95% CI 754 782-785 This heterogeneity was caused by varying size, not direction, of effect. All thr ee ecological studies r eported inverse associations between blood or plasma selenium and stomach cancer mortality,236 729 786which were statistically significant in two.236 786 A dose-response relationship is apparent from case-control but not cohort data. Two additional cohort studies, both fr om China, stratified results according to tumour location.789 790The apparent pro- tective effect was strengthened for cardia cancers, but dis-appear ed for pr oximal. Nails and hair The single cohort study that investigated selenium in nails showed statistically significant decreased risk for the high- est levels when compared to the lowest in men, but notwomen. The effect estimates were 0.4 in men (95% CI 0.17-0.96; 72 cases) and 1.68 in women (95% CI 0.43-6.54; 20 cases). 787 The single case-control study found that mean hair selenium levels were significantly lower in the 15 stomachcancer cases than in controls. 788 The general mechanisms through which foods containing selenium could plausibly protect against stomach cancer are outlined below. In addition, selenoproteins with powerful antioxidant activity may provide protection against theinflammatory effect of H pylori , which can lead to gastric cancer in infected individuals.791 A substantial amount of evidence was available on selenium, from dietary questionnaires, as well asblood, nails, and hair , mostly fr om case-contr ol studies. There is limited evidence suggesting that foods containing selenium pr otect against stomach cancer . Colorectum Fifteen y, serum or plasma, toenail selenium Meta-analysis was possible on six independent effect esti - mates from five case-control studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 0.86 (95% CI 0.78-0.95) per 10 \u00b5g/dl serum, with high heterogeneity.785 792-795All of these studies report- ed decreased risk, which was statistically significant in fourof the five studies. 792-795The heter ogeneity is ther efore derived from varying size, but not direction of effect. The remaining 10 studies reported non-significant decreasedrisk. 738These data are supported by limited evidence sug- gesting that there is also a protective effect from seleniumsupplements (see chapter 4.10.6.4.5). The general mechanisms thr ough which foods containing selenium could plausibly pr otect against color ectal cancer are outlined below. A substantial amount of data was available, fr om case- control studies only. There is limited evidence suggesting that foods containing selenium pr otect against color ectal cancer . General mechanisms \u2014 foods containing selenium Dietar y selenium deficiency has been shown to cause a lack of selenoprotein expression. Twenty-five selenoproteins have been identified in animals and a number of these haveimportant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. 796 Four are glutathione peroxidises, which protect against oxidative damage to lipids, lipoproteins, and DNA. These enzymes ar e rapidly degraded during selenium deprivation . Three are thioredoxin reductases and, amongst other func- tions, these regenerate oxidised ascorbic acid to its activeantio xidant form. 112PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Selenoproteins appear to reach their maximal levels relatively easily at normal dietary selenium intake and not to increase with selenium supplementation. It is, how- ever, plausible that supraphysiological amounts of seleniummight affect programmed cell death, DNA repair, carcinogen metabolism, immune system, and anti-angiogenic effects. 797 4.2.5.9 Foods containing quercetin case-control studies327 477 799investigated foods containing quercetin and lung cancer. Both cohort studies showed statistically significant decreased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the lowest.147 798The effect estimates were 0.63 (95% CI 0.52-0.78)147and 0.42 (95% CI 0.25-0.72).798Both studies adjusted for smoking. Two case-control studies showed decreased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the lowest,327 477 which was statistically significant in one.327One study reported non-significant incr eased risk.799The have been over-adjusted. Quercetin is a flavonoid. It is an antioxidant and also directly inhibits expression of CYP1A1 (a cytochrome P450enzyme that helps to formation of DNA adducts. 475Elevated CYP1A1 activity has been associated with incr eased risk of lung can- cer, primarily in smok ers.476The evidence for C YP1A1/ flavonoid interactions is supported by the observation that protective associations of flavonoids ar e associated with specific CYP1A1 genotypes.476 477 The evidence available is sparse and inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that foodscontaining quercetin protect against lung cancer. 4.2.5.10 Pulses (legumes) Studies conducted in W estern countries, as most cohorts have been , are likely to have limited power to detect an asso- ciation between pulses, and particularly soya intak e, and cancer risk because consumption tends to be low. Stomach Three cohort studies,144 146 24122 case-control studies,109 157 161 162 165 175 179 180 185-187 190 219 224 243 244 247 249-251 270 271 482 2 cross-sectional studies,196 800and 16 ecological studies116- 119 197 236 238 239 801investigated pulses (legumes) and cancer. Two cohort studies,802 803 9 case-contr ol studies,109 129 159 178 184 194 226 229 262and 2 eco - logical studies208 804investigated soya and soya products. Pulses (legumes) All three cohort studies reported decreased risk with increased intak e of pulses (legumes),144 146 241which was statistically significant in one.146Meta-analysis was possible on two studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 0.93 (95% CI 0.82-1.05) per 20 g/day, with moderate heterogeneity.144 146 Twelve case-contr ol studies showed decr eased risk for thehighest intake groups when compared to the lowest,109 157 161 165 179 185-187 190 219 247 249 250 271which was statistically signifi- cant in six.109 161 165 179 190 249Six studies reported increased risk,162 224 243 251 270 482which was statistically significant in two.224 243 270The remaining four studies reported no effect on risk,180 244or stated that there was no significant effect on risk.175Meta-analysis was possible on eight studies, giv- ing a summary effect estimate of 0.93 (95% CI 0.87-0.99) per 20 g/day, with moderate to high heterogeneity.157 162 179 180 186 187 247 249 A dose-response relationship is apparent from case-control but not cohort data. One ecological study reported a statistically significant association, so that higher soya consumption was associatedwith lower stomach cancer risk. 208The other 15 reported no significant association.116-119 197 198 200-203 209 236 238 239 801 Soya and soya products Both cohort studies showed decreased risk for the highest intak e groups when compar ed to the lowest,802 803which was statistically significant in one.803The effect estimates were 0.60 (44 cases, 95% CI 0.40-1.10)802and 0.86 (121 cases, 95% CI 0.77-0.96) per 20 g/day.803The smaller study was not adjusted for any confounders. All nine case-control studies showed decreased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the lowest,109 129 159 178 184 194 226 229 262which was statistically significant in five.129 159 178 184 226Meta-analysis was possible on seven studies, giv - ing a summar y effect estimate of 0.82 (95% CI 0.72-0.94) per 20 g/day, with high heterogeneity.109 129 159 178 194 226 229 Heter ogeneity is derived fr om the size, and not the dir ection , of the effect. A dose-response relationship is apparent from case-control data, as well as fr om one of the two cohort studies. Both ecological studies reported statistically significant inverse relationships, with stomach cancer risk decreasing inareas of increased soya consumption. 208 804 The general mechanisms through which pulses (legumes), soya and soya pr oducts could plausibly protect against stom- ach cancer ar e outlined below . In addition, laboratory exper- iments have shown that genistein slows down thedevelopment of stomach cancers promoted by sodium chlo- ride by increasing apoptosis, and lowering cell proliferationand blood vessel gr owth. 805Additionally , in a rodent model, a diet containing miso inhibited N-nitrosamine-induced stomach tumours.806 The evidence, mostly from case-control studies, is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that pulses (legumes), including soya and soya pr oducts, protect cohort studies,589 592-59411 studies,595 597 113CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS Pulses (legumes) Two cohort studies reported statistically significant decreased risk with increased intake589 592; the third study reported that there was no significant association.594The reported effect estimates were 0.93 (95% CI CI 0.714-0.934)592per serving/week. The latter was specif- ic to beans and lentils. Eight of the case-control studies showed decreased risk with increased intake,595 597 599 608 617 620 624 715which was sta- tistically significant in two.597 624One study showed a non- significant increased risk604and the other reported no effect on risk.600One study showed a non-significant increased risk for dried beans and lentils and a non-significant decreased risk with fresh beans and lentils.601Meta analysis was pos- sible on four relatively good quality case-control studies, giv-ing a summary effect estimate of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.98)per serving/week, with no heterogeneity. 595 597 599 601 A dose-response relationship is apparent from two of the cohort studies, as well as case-control data. The five ecological studies generally fail to show a clear relationship between consumption of pulses and prostatecancer risk; corr elations range 118 609 807-809 Soya and soya products The cohort studies reported a wide range of results based on different specific exposures.810-813One study, which report- ed on soya and soya pr oducts, showed a non-significant decreased risk for the highest intak e groups when compared to the lowest, with an effect estimate of 0.79 (95% CI 0.53-1.18).810One study r eported a statistically significant decreased risk with increased intake of soya milk (0.93, 95% CI 0.87-0.99) per serving/week and a risk between soya bean paste soup intakeand prostate cancer. 811The final study reported non-signif- icant harmful effects for miso soup and foods cooked in soysauce, with effect estimates of 1.05 (95% CI 0.94-1.18) and1.06 (0.474, 2.39) r espectively per 812 All four case-contr ol studies showed non-significant decreased risk with increased intake.597 603 715 814-816Meta analysis was possible on two case-control studies, giving asummar y effect estimate of 0.98 (95% CI 0.95-1.00). 597 715 The two ecological studies reported no clear relationship between soya consumption and pr ostate cancer .804 808 Heter ogeneity is lik ely to be derived fr om the wide vari - ety in specific foods being investigated. The general mechanisms through which pulses (legumes), soya and soya pr oducts could plausibly pr otect against prostate cancer are outlined below. In addition, phytoestro- gens in pulses and soya can have an androgenic effect, poten-tially inhibiting testosterone-induced growth of the prostate. The evidence, mostly fr om case-control studies, is inconsistent. Ther e is limited evidence suggesting that pulses (legumes), including soya and soya products, \u2014 pulses (legumes) Pulses (legumes), particularly soya foods, contain various compounds that may have anti-cancer effects, including pro- tease inhibitors, saponins, and phytoestrogens, such as genis-tein and daidzein, which are found in high concentrations in soya. 817These compounds could plausibly influence oestrogen metabolism. They have also been shown to have antioxidant effects, inhibit the growth of blood vessels to a tumour, and may influence apoptosis and cell growth.818 4.2.5.11 Nuts and seeds The evidence was too limited in amount, consistency, or quality to draw any conclusions 4.2.5.12 Herbs and spices Garlic can be classified as a herb or as an allium vegetable. Data on garlic have contributed to the evidence base for alli- um vegetables and stomach cancer (see chapter 4.2.5.1.1) and garlic also probably protects against colorectal cancer(see chapter 4.2.5.1.1). 4.2.5.12.1 Chilli Stomach Fourteen case-control studies investigated chilli use and stomach cancer.171 175 176 180 182 187 189 219 246 247 259 415 819-821 Nine studies showed increased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the lowest,175 176 180 187 189 219 259 415 820 821which was statistically significant in four ,175 180 259 821statistically significant in men but not women in a fifth study,219and statistically significant in non-drinkers of alco- hol, but not alcohol drink ers, in a sixth.176Four studies showed decreased risk,171 182 246 247which was statistically sig- nificant in three.182 246 247One study reported no significant effect on risk.819 Chilli may be used to disguise 'off' flavours in foods, there- fore these data may be confounded by socioeconomic sta-tus, the availability of refrigeration, and H pylori infection. Some constituents of chilli are irritants which could there- fore plausibly increase inflammation in the stomach. The evidence, fr om case-contr ol studies only, is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that chilli is associated with an increased risk of stomachcancer . 4.2.4 Comparison with pr evious r eport The previous report concluded that the evidence that diets high in vegetables and fruits pr otect against cancers of the mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, lung, and stomach was con- vincing; and that the evidence that diets high in vegetablesprotect against colorectal cancer was also convincing. The previous report also judged that diets high in vegetables and fruits pr obably protected against cancers of the larynx, pan- creas, br east, and bladder . The panel also noted a pattern whereby diets high in vegetables and fruits possibly pro- tected against cancers of the cervix, ovary, endometrium,and thyr oid; and that diets high in vegetables possibly pr o- 114PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS tected against cancers of the liver, prostate, and kidney. Since the mid-1990s, a number of cohort studies have somewhat weakened the overall evidence for the protective effects of vegetables and fruits. A number of judgements ofprobable protective effects are made for non-starchy veg- etables and for fruits (mouth, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, stomach, and (fruits only) lung). In general, the reason for this is that the more recent cohort studies failed to show the effect seen in case-control studies. The previous report also made judgements on types of veg- etables and fruits in a footnote, while choosing not to enter these into the matrix. The evidence that green vegetables protected against lung and stomach cancer was judged con- vincing; and probable for mouth and oesophageal cancer.The evidence that cruciferous vegetables protected againstcolorectal and thyroid cancer was judged probable. The evi-dence that allium vegetables protected against stomach can- cer was judged probable. The evidence that raw vegetables and citrus fruits protected against stomach cancer wasjudged convincing. These classifications ar e somewhat dif - ferent from those made in this Report, but mostly also gen- erated mor e confident judgements than ar e made her e. Vitamins, minerals, and other bioactive constituents of foods and drinks were assessed as such in the previousreport, whereas here they are assessed either as containedin foods and drinks or (see chapter 4.10) as supplements.The previous report judged that carotenoids (in food) prob-ably pr otected against lung cancer; that vitamin C (in food) probably pr otected against stomach cancer; and that these vitamins and vitamin E possibly protected against cancers of a number of sites. The previous panel regretted the lack of evidence on puls- es (legumes), nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices, and made nosignificant judgements. Since then , evidence on soya and its products, and on garlic (as well as allium vegetables in gen- eral) and chilli, has increased and allowed some judgements. The previous report judged that aflatoxin contamination was a probable cause of liver cancer. Since then, the overallevidence, particularly on the underlying mechanisms, hasstrengthened. The pr evious r eport emphasised evidence on vegetables and on fruits as a whole, while noting evidence on categories of vegetables and fruits. This Report has not made any sep-arate judgement on raw vegetables and fruits. The pr evious report classified bananas as plantains. Here they are classi- fied as fruits. The pr evious r eport considered micronutrients and phytochemicals contained in foods of plant origin in sep - arate chapters. Here, the evidence has been characterised in terms of foods containing specified micronutrients, and theyare consider ed together with vegetables and fruits, pulses (legumes), nuts and seeds, and other plant foods. Similarly, the previous report considered dietary fibre separately fromcereals (grains) and other plant foods. Here, dietary fibre is considered in the context of cereals (grains) and other plant foods, including those assessed in this section . 4.2.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : Findings from cohort studies conducted since the mid-1990shave made the overall evidence that vegetables, or fruits, protect against cancers, somewhat less impressive. In no case now is evidence of protection judged to be convincing. However, there is evidence that some types of vegetables, and fruits in general, probably protect against a number ofcancers. The few judgements on legumes (pulses), nuts, seeds, and (with two exceptions) herbs and spices, reflect the small amount of epidemiological evidence. Non-starchy vegetables probably protect against cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx, and those of the oesopha-gus and stomach. There is limited evidence suggesting thatthey also protect against cancers of the nasopharynx, lung,colorectum, ovary, and endometrium. Allium vegetables cancer. Garlic (an allium veg- etable, commonly classed as a herb) probably protects againstcolor ectal cancer . Fruits in general probably protect against cancers of the mouth, phar ynx, and lar ynx, and of the oesophagus, lung, and stomach. There is limited evidence suggesting that fruits also protect against cancers of the nasopharynx, pancreas,liver, and colorectum. There is limited evidence suggesting that carrots protect against cervical cancer; and that pulses (legumes), includingsoya and soya pr oducts, protect against stomach and prostate cancers. Ther e is limited evidence suggesting that chilli is a cause of stomach cancer. Fruits and non-star chy vegetables ar e low ener gy-dense foods. For a discussion of the effect of such foods and drinks on weight gain, overweight, and obesity, and the role ofweight gain , over weight, and obesity in the risk of some can - cers, see Chapters 6, 7, and 8. Evidence that vegetables, fruits, and pulses protect against some cancers is supported by evidence on various micronu-trients, which act as markers for consumption of vegetables,fruits, and pulses (legumes), and other plant foods. F oods containing folate pr obably pr otect against pancreatic cancer, and ther e is limited evidence suggesting that these also pr o- tect against oesophageal and colorectal cancers. Foods con- taining carotenoids probably protect against cancers of themouth, phar ynx, and larynx, and also lung cancer. Foods con- taining the carotenoid beta-carotene probably protect against oesophageal cancer ; and foods containing lycopene, found in tomatoes and also fruits such as watermelon , guavas, and apricots, probably protect against prostate cancer. Foods con- taining vitamin C, found in some vegetables, citrus and otherfruits, and potatoes, pr obably pr otect against oesophageal cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that foods con- taining quercetin, such as apples, tea, and onions, protectagainst lung cancer. Evidence on foods containing other micronutrients is gr ouped here, for ease of reference. Foods containing 115CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS selenium probably protect against prostate cancer; there is limited evidence suggesting that they protect against stomach and colorectal cancers. There is limited evidence suggesting that foods containing the B vitamin pyridoxineprotect against oesophageal and prostate cancers; and that foods containing vitamin E protect against oesophageal and prostate cancers. 116PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS These animal foods are sources of protein and micronutrients. The amount and nature of the fat content of meat, poultry, and fish depends on methods of rearing, processing, and pr eparation, as well as the type of animal. Production and consumption of r ed meat and pr ocessed meat generally rise with increases in available income. Consumption of beef and products made with beef is still increasing, notably in China and other middle- and low- income countries. In many countries, poultry is now also intensively reared and consumption has increased greatly. Much fish is now farmed. In general, the Panel judges that the evidence on red meat and pr ocessed meat is stronger than it was in the mid-1990s. Epidemiological evidence on other methods of pr eserving and preparing meats and other animal foods is sparse; the overall evidence remains suggestive, at most. The evidenceon poultry , fish, and eggs is generally insubstantial.The Panel judges as follows: The evidence that r ed meats and processed meats are a cause of colorectal cancer is convincing. Cantonese-style salted fish is a pr obable cause of nasopharyngeal cancer . This finding does not apply to any other type of fish product. Cantonese-style salted fish is also subject tofermentation. There is limited evidence suggesting that fish, and also foods containing vitamin D, protect against colorectal cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that red meat is a cause of cancers of the oesophagus, lung, pancreasand endometrium; that processed meat is a cause ofcancers of the oesophagus, lung, stomach and pr ostate; and that foods containing ir on ar e a cause of color ectal cancer. There is also limited evidence that animal foods that are grilled (broiled), barbecued (charbroiled), or smok ed, ar e a cause of stomach cancer . 4.3 Meat, poultry, fish, and eggs MEAT, POULTRY, FISH, EGGS, AND THE RISK OF CANCER In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence.

This conclusion does not apply to fish prepared (or salted) by other means. 4Includes both foods naturally containing the constituent and foods which have the constituent added (see chapter 3.5.3). 5 Although red and processed meats contain iron, the general category of 'foods containing iron' comprises many other foods, including those of plant origin.6 The evidence is mostly from meats preserved or cooked in these ways. 7Found mostly in for tified foods and animal foods. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. 117CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS Red meat can be relatively high in animal fats. For a discussion of the role of animal fats on cancer, see chapter4.4 and Chapter 7. Meat can also be energy dense. Fordiscussion on the role of energy-dense foods on weightgain, overweight, and obesity, and the role of weight gain,overweight, and obesity in the risk of some cancers, seeChapters 6 and 8. The strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of 'convincing' and 'probable', shows that red meat andprocessed meat are causes of colorectal cancer, and thatCantonese-style salted fish is probably a cause of nasopharyngeal cancer. The Panel also notes limited evidence suggesting that red meat and processed meat arecauses of other cancers. It is generally, though not universally, agreed that humans evolved as omnivores, and that healthy diets usually include foods of plant and of animal origin \u2014 including meat, poul-try, fish, and eggs, as well as milk and other dair y products. Most people who do not eat meat, flesh, or any food of ani- mal origin do so for r eligious or ethical r easons. Impoverished communities eat little flesh and meat is reserved for feasts. Partly because meat-eating is a sign of prosperity and partlybecause many people enjoy eating meat, poultry, and fish,production and consumption generally rise as availableincome increases. Consumption of beef is, for example, nowincreasing very rapidly in China, and consumption of 'burg- ers' made fr om beef is incr easing worldwide. Early reports concerned with nutritional deficiencies iden- tified meat, poultr y, and fish as good sour ces of pr otein, iron, and other nutrients, and eggs as a 'complete food', especially for children. By contrast, in the second half of the 20th cen-tury, reports on meat, poultr y, fish, and eggs tended to focus on red meat as a source of fat and saturated fatty acids and on eggs as a source of dietary cholesterol in the causationof coronary heart disease. These reports promoted poultryand fish as better choices than red meat, either because theycontain less fat and saturated fatty acids or , in the case of oily fish, they contain unsaturated fats identified as pr otec- tive. Little attention has been given to flesh fr om wild ani - mals and birds, despite this being known to have a different nutritional profile \u2014 lower in total fat and higher in unsat-urated fatty acids. On the other hand, since the mid-1990s more attention has been given in epidemiological studies to processed meat as a cause or possible cause of cancers of some sites. For discussion of the role of red meat and processed meat in energy-dense foods and drinks, the effect of energy-densefoods and drinks on weight gain , over weight, and obesity , and the role of weight gain, overweight, and obesity in the risk of some cancers, see Chapters 6 and 8. In this Report, methods of production, preservation, pro- cessing, and preparation (including cooking), that are sole- ly or mainly to do with meat and other animal foods, ar e included her e. Processed meat as a categor y is included her e. The mineral iron is also covered here, although it is also found in plant foods. 4.3.1 Definitions and sources Meat and poultry In this Report, meat includes all animal flesh apart from fish and seafood. Meat can be further classed as either red meat, which generally refers to flesh from animals that have more red than white muscle fibres (in this Report, beef, goat, lamb, and pork), or poultry, which usually has more white than red muscle fibres (from birds such as chickens, guinea fowl, andturkeys). Meat can also be categorised by dividing it into meats from skeletal muscles or the internal organs (offal, such as the brain, liver, heart, intestines, and tongue). Meat can also be divided according to whether the animal was domesticated or wild. Most meats consumed around theworld today are from domesticated animals. 'Wild' meats,that is from non-domesticated or free-ranging species, are asignificant source of protein and energy among some popu- lations. Some non-domesticated animals, such as deer or buf- falo, are also farmed. However, the evidence presented inthis chapter applies only to meat fr om domesticated animals. Some meats are processed in various ways (box 4.3.1). Fish This Report uses the culinary definition of fish, which includes shellfish. There are more than 27 000 species of saltand freshwater fish; many more crustaceans, bivalves, andcephalopods can also be eaten. Fish and shellfish are the onlyfoods that, globally , are still obtained in significant quanti- ties fr om the wild. But many species ar e on the verge of com- mercial extinction and aquaculture is increasing worldwide. For instance, mor e than a thir d of the salmon eaten world - wide is farmed. Like meat, fish is also processed, for instance by drying, salting, and smoking. Eggs Eggs are the ova of animals and in this Report mean only What is 'processed meat'? The question is important because, as shown her e, the evidence that processed meat is a cause of colorectal cancer is convincing. In the br oad sense of the wor d, most meat is pr ocessed \u2014 cook - ing is a process. But as commonly used, the term 'processed meat' refers to meats (usually red meats) preserved by smoking, curing, or salting, or by the addition of preservatives. Meats preserved only by refrigeration, however they are cooked, are usually notclassified as 'processed meat'. There is no generally agreed definition of 'processed meat'. The term is used inconsistently in epidemiological studies. Judgementsand recommendations are therefore less clear than they could be. Ham, bacon, pastrami, and salami ar e processed meats. So ar e bratwursts, ters, and other preservatives are added (box 4.3.2). Mincedmeats sometimes fall inside this definition, often if they are pre-served chemically, but not always. The same point applies to 'ham- burgers'. Given the impor tance of this issue, transnational burger caterers should specify the methods they use to process their products.Box 4.3.1 Processed meat118PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS those of birds; because they are generally eaten before they have been fertilised, they do not contain an embryo. Eggs are eaten both on their own and as an ingredient in a vari- ety of baked goods, sauces, and other composite foods.Chicken eggs are most commonly eaten, although people also eat duck, ostrich, and quail eggs. Fish eggs (roe) and turtle eggs are not included here. 4.3.2 Composition Meat and poultry Meat contains around 20-35 per cent protein by weight. The fat content by weight ranges from less than 4 per cent in leanpoultry to 30-40 per cent in fatty meat from domesticated,farmed animals. About 50 per cent of the fatty acids in leanmeat are monounsaturated fatty acids, while saturated fatty acids make up around 40-50 per cent (see chapter 4.4.2). Poultry contains a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids(30-35 per cent) and a higher pr oportion of polyunsaturat - ed fatty acids (15-30 per cent compared with 4-10 per cent). 1 There are differ ences between meats fr om domesticated ani - mals and wild meats. Wild animals are typically more mature, leaner, and contain a greater variety of aromatic compoundsthan farmed animals. They will have received no medicationand their diets will have been uncontrolled. Wild animals arenot only lower in fat, but also have a higher proportion ofpolyunsaturated fatty acids than farmed varieties and a lowerproportion of saturated fatty acids. Two iron-containing components of muscle tissue, myo- globin and cytochr omes, give meat its r ed colour . It also con - tains relatively high levels of B vitamins, particularly B6 (pyridoxine) and B12, as well as vitamin D, and providesreadily absorbable iron, zinc, and selenium. Eating red meat increases levels of N-nitroso compounds in the body (bo x 4.3.2), which may be partially due to its high haem content (box 4.3.3). If meat is cook ed over an open flame, at high temperatures, and charred or 'well done', heterocyclic amines or polycyclic aromatic 4.3.4). Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a critical role in calcium and bone metabolism and in controlling cell dif-ferentiation. Low levels may lead to osteomalacia or, in chil-dren, rickets and possibly osteoporosis, with increasedfractur e risk. Most vitamin D is derived from the action of sunlight on the skin . Foods such as milk or fat spreads (see chapter 4.9) may be fortified, and then become the majordietary source of vitamin D; natural sources include sardines and other oily fish, meat, and eggs. Fish Fish has similar levels of pr otein to meat. It has a fat by weight content of between 0.5 per cent in low-fat fish suchas cod or skate to as much as 20 per cent in oily fish such as Atlantic salmon or eels. Fat from fish contains lower lev-els of saturated fatty acids (ar ound 20-25 per cent) than meat. Fish oils from saltwater fish contain long-chain n-3 fatty acids (see chapter 4.4.2). Wild fish have a lower fat content than farmed fish, with a higher proportion of n-3 fatty acids. Only marine algae and phytoplankton pr oduce these fatty acids, so the fish that feed on them ar e the primar y dietar y sources. These fatty acids are essential to the development and function of the brain and retina; they also reduce inflam-mation , blood clotting, and cholester ol production. The bodyIron deficiency is the most common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world. It is most common among children andpremenopausal women, and results in iron deficiency anaemia. Haem iron is found only in foods of animal origin, such as meat and meat products, fish, and blood products. Non-haemiron is found in plant foods, such as lentils, beans, leafy veg- etables, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, figs, and apricots. The amount of dietary iron needed to meet the body's requirementsdepends on its bioavailability from the diet. This varies with the diet, as well as factors related to the consumer such as their iron status. Iron from animal sources is better absorbed than ironfrom plant sources, but non-haem iron absorption is enhanced when the body's iron status is low, or when iron-rich foods are eaten together with vitamin-C rich foods or with meat. Iron has a central role in metabolism. It is involved in oxida- tive metabolism within cells and is a component of a number of enzymes. Free iron can also catalyse the generation of freeradicals, which cause oxidative damage to specific cell compo- nents including DNA, protein, and membrane lipids. Iron metab- olism and transport are strictly regulated to reduce the likelihood of cells being exposed to free iron and so to oxida- tive damage; most iron in living tissues is bound to proteins, such as transferrin and ferritin, which prevent its involvement in free-radical generation. Also see chapter 4.10.Box 4.3.3 Foods containing iron Nitrate occurs naturally in plants; levels var y between species and with dif ferent soil conditions and the amount of fertiliser used. In high-income countries, vegetables account for 70-97per cent of dietary nitrate intake. 2Between 5 and 20 per cent of the nitrate in diets is conver ted by the body into nitrite, a sub- stance that is also found in some vegetables (notably potatoes).Nitrite is used to preserve processed meats (it is extremely toxic to bacteria) and gives cur ed meats their r ecognisable colour and flavours. The addition of nitrite and nitrate to food is r egulat - ed and monitored in most countries. Nitrite can react with the degradation products of amino acids to form N-nitroso compounds (nitrosamines or nitrosamides). These may be formed in meat during the curing process or in the body (particularly in the stomach) from dietary nitrite (or nitrate). Several N-nitroso compounds are known human or animal carcinogens.3There is concer n that nitrite, fr om pr ocessed meats for example, nitrates in vegetables, and pr eformed nitrosamines may be involved in carcinogenesis, particularly in the stomach (see Chapter 2). Dietary nitrates and nitrites are probable human carcinogens because they are converted in the body to N-nitroso compounds.3Box 4.3.2 Nitrates, nitrites, and N-nitroso compounds119CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS can convert alpha-linolenic acid (found in plant foods and essential in the diet) to eicosapentaenoic acid and docoso - hexanoic acid, which ar e found in fish oils, but the rates of conversion ar e low . Fish contain lower levels of B vitamins, iron, and zinc than meat and poultry, but oily fish are a source of retinol and vit-amin D. F ish are also a source of calcium if the bones are eaten with the flesh, for example, when canned. Fish and shellfish have the potential to accumulate pollu - tants that ar e washed into rivers and oceans, and these tend to accumulate in their fat. These pollutants can include heavy metals and organic compounds, some of which areknown car cinogens. F armed fish ar e exposed to veterinar y medicines, and some environmental toxins may reach high concentrations in their food. But farmed fish are less likelythan wild fish to become contaminated with environmental pollutants. The balance of risks and benefits of eating fish at various stages of the life course needs to be determined.Also see chapter 4.9. Eggs Eggs, lik e meat, poultr y, and fish, contain all the essentialamino acids needed by humans. A typical large hen's egg has roughly equal weights of protein and fat, with 60 per cent of the energy coming from fat. A typical large shelled egg contains 6 g protein; 1 g carbohydrate; 4.5 g fat (2.0 gmonounsaturated, 0.5 g polyunsaturated, and 1.5 g satu- rated fatty acids); and about 200 mg cholesterol. con- tains retinol, folate, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and iron. The yolk's colour comes from carotenoids, and contains all of the fat and cholesterol andmost of the iron, thiamin, and retinol. The white is 90 per cent water and is virtually fat free, containing mainly pro- tein, with some vitamins, and traces of glucose. In Asia, eggs containing 2-3 week old chick fetuses may occasionally be included in diets. There is no nutritional dif-ference between these and unfertilised eggs, except that fer-tilised eggs contain additional calcium absorbed from theshell. 4.3.3 Consumption patter ns Meat and poultr y Globally, meat accounts for about 8 per cent of total energy availability, 18 per cent of dietary protein, and 23 per centof dietary fat. Meat consumption is considerably higher inhigh-income countries (10 per cent of total energy intakecompared with 7 per cent in low-income countries), and isparticularly high in the US A, parts of South America, some parts of Asia, northern Eur ope, and most of Oceania. Consumption is particularly low in most of Africa and other parts of Asia wher e vegetarian ways of life ar e commonplace. Bangladesh has the lowest level of intake (0.6 per cent) and Mongolia the highest (28 per cent). 7 As a general rule, meat consumption incr eases with eco - nomic development. Worldwide, between 1961 and 2002, meat consumption per person doubled, with pork and poul-try showing the greatest increases; in Japan it increasednearly six-fold. Globally, overall energy availability increas-ed in the same period by just 12 per cent. Consumption ofmeat and other animal foods fr om wild and undomesticat - ed animals is low on a global basis, but these foods ar e important parts of diets within many middle- and low- income countries, as well as being delicacies in high-incomecountries. Fish Worldwide, fish (including shellfish) account for 1 per cent of available dietary energy; these foods are particularly important in island and coastal communities. For instance,in the Maldives, marine fish account for 15 per cent of dietary energy, but in some landlocked, low-income coun- tries, this figure is practically zero. In general, fish con-sumption is highest in Asia and Oceania. Freshwater fish provide a relatively small proportion of dietary energy (0.3 per cent), but they ar e a more important source of dietary energy in low-income countries, and ar e particularly impor - tant in regions with large lakes and rivers. Salting is a tra- ditional method of preserving raw fish throughout much ofthe world (bo x 4.3.5).Heterocyclic amines are formed when muscle meats such as beef, pork, fowl, and fish are cooked. High cooking tempera- tures cause amino acids and creatine (a chemical found in mus- cles) to react together to form these chemicals. So far, 17different heterocyclic amines have been identified as being formed by cooking muscle meats and which may pose a cancer risk (also see Chapter 2). Temperature is the most important factor in the formation of these chemicals. Frying, grilling (broiling), and barbecuing (char- broiling) produce the largest amounts because these cookingmethods use very high temperatures. Oven roasting and bak- ing involve lower temperatures, so meats cooked in this way are lower in heterocyclic amines, but gravy made from meat drip-pings contains substantial amounts. Meats that are partially cooked in a microwave oven before being cooked by other higher-temperature methods also have lower levels of thesechemicals. 4 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of over 100 different chemicals formed when organic substances like tobacco or meat ar e bur nt incompletely . Grilling (br oiling) and barbecuing (charbroiling) meat, fish, or other foods with intense heat over a direct flame results in fat dropping on the hot fire;this produces PAHs that stick to the surface of food. The moreintense the heat, the higher the level of contamination; usingwood creates more PAHs than charcoal. Cereals contaminatedwith PAHs are also a common source of these chemicals in thediet. Levels in cer eals are considerably lower than in grilled meats, but their overall contribution to diets is larger. 5Taken together , cereals and meat and meat products account for more than 50 per cent of dietar y levels of these chemicals. Intakes ar e thought to be relatively high in Europe, particularly in north- ern Europe, although measures are only available from a high-income, hydrocarbons120PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Eggs Worldwide, eggs provide 1.2 per cent of available food ener- gy. Egg consumption is highest in the Far East, NorthAmerica, and Europe, ranging from nearly 3 per cent in theseareas to virtually zero in many African countries; it is sig- nificantly higher in high-income countries. Pr eserved eggs (pickled, salted, or cured) are traditional in some cultures. 4.3.4 Interpretation of the evidence 4.3.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2,3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' (RR) is used in this Report to denote ratio measur es of effect, including Specific Some considerations specific to meat, poultr y, fish, and eggs include: Classification . 'Fish' is a br oad classification . Differ ent fish have different nutritional profiles and biological effects, one obvious example being white fish and oily fish. These areoften not distinguished in epidemiological studies. Terminology . As yet, there is no agreed definition for 'processed meat'. Some studies count minced meat, or ham, bacon, and sausages as processed meats; others do not. See the footnote to the matrix and bo x 4.3.1. Confounding . People who consume large amounts of meat and processed meats tend to consume less poultry, fish, andvegetables, and vice versa. So an appar ent effect of meat andprocessed meat could possibly be due, at least in part, to low intakes of these other foods. Production, processing, patterns . Practically all the evidence relates to these foods as preserved, processed, or prepared (cooked) in some way. Evidence on meat, poultry, and increasingly on fish, is practically all from these foods as pro- duced industrially. There is very little evidence on wild ani- mals and birds, despite the quantity and nature of their bodyfat, and other aspects of their nutritional profile, being dif- ferent. Epidemiological evidence on specific methods of preservation, processing, and preparation/cooking of meat, poultry, and fish is mostly patchy, despite some of these being known to generate carcinogens established as such in exper-imental studies. Also see chapter 4.9. 4.3.5 Evidence and judgements The full systematic literatur e review (SLR) is contained on the CD included with this Report. 4.3.5.1 Meat 4.3.5.1.1 Red meat Some studies may have included processed meats in their classification of red meat intake. Color ectum Sixteen cohort studies8-24and 71 case-contr ol studies inves - tigated red meat and colorectal cancer. All of the cohort studies that r eported analyses of risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest showed increased risk (figure 4.3.1),8-24which was statisti- cally significant in four (one of these was specific to rapid-acetylator genotypes). 9 10 12 18 23Meta-analysis was possibleSalting is a traditional method of preserving raw fish through- out much of the world. The freshness of the fish and the salt- ing and drying conditions vary considerably between regions, although fish are usually dried outside, in direct sunlight. This results in varying levels of fermentation and/or insect infesta- tion. Salted fish is a component of diets typical of Asia, Africa, and parts of the Mediterranean. Depending on the precise conditions, salt-preserved fish may also undergo fermentation. The degree of fermentation thatoccurs depends on the freshness of the raw fish, the amount of salt used, the outdoor temperature, and the duration of the dry- ing process. In general, excluding the factor of freshness, salt-ed fish is less likely to be fermented in the northern part of China compared with the southern part of China (where nasopharyngeal cancer is more common). Cantonese-style salt-ed fish is characterised by using less salt and a higher degree of fermentation during the drying process, because of the rela- tively high outdoor temperature and moisture levels. Cantonese-style salted fish are a traditional part of the diet in souther n China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore.Box 4.3.5 Cantonese-style salted fish Figure 4.3.1 Red meat cancer; cohort studies Philips 1975 2.70 (1.60-4.55) Slattery 2001 Women 1.04 (0.62-1.75)Kato 1997 Women 1.23 1998 1.41 (0.90-2.21) Pietinen 1999 Men 1.20 (0.80-1.80) Jarvinen 2001 1.50 (0.77-2.93)Tiemersma 2002 Men 2.70 (1.09-6.66)Tiemersma 2002 Women 1.20 (0.51-2.84)Wei 2003 Men 1.35 (0.80-2.27)Wei 2003 Women 1.31 (0.73-2.36) Chen 2003 1.48 (0.85-2.59) English 2004 1.40 (1.02-1.93)Norat 2004 1.17 (0.92-1.49)Relative risk (95% CI) Relative risk, highest vs lowest exposure category15 0.2 0.5 2121CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS on seven studies that measured red meat intake in 'times per week' and three studies that measured grams per day. Thesummary effect estimates were 1.43 (95% confidence inter-val (CI) 1.05-1.94) per times/week and (figures 4.3.2 and4.3.3). Ther e was moderate heterogeneity in the former analysis and low heter ogeneity in the latter . A dose-response relationship is apparent from cohort data (figur e 4.3.4). These data are supported by a recently published meta- analysis of 15 prospective studies, which reported a sum-mary effect estimate of 1.28 (95% CI 1.18-1.39) per 120 g/day. 25 Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised.

In addition, dietar y haem ir on induces colonic cytotoxicity and hyper- proliferation .26 A substantial amount of data from cohort and case- contr ol studies showed a dose-response relationship, supported by evidence for plausible mechanisms operating in humans. R ed meat is a convincing cause of color ectal cancer . The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, six cohort27-32and four case contr ol studies33-36have been pub - lished.

The general mechanisms through which red meat could plausibly cause cancer are outlined below. There is limited evidence, mostly from inconsistent case-control studies, suggesting that red meat is acause of lung cancer. Pancreas Seven cohort studies63-69and four case-control studies46 70-72 investigated r ed meat and pancr eatic cancer . Six cohort studies showed increased risk for the highest intak e group when compar ed to the lowest,63-65 67-69which was statistically significant in one,64and two of the studies also had statistically significant tests for trend.65 67One study reported a non-significant increased risk that was very closeto no effect. 66Meta-analysis was possible on two studies, giv- ing a summary effect estimate of 1.00 (95% CI 20 g/day , with no heterogeneity. 63 66However , the two included studies wer e not typical. The effect estimates for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest in the other five cohort studies wer e 1.45 (95% CI 1.19-1.76),64 1.73 (95% CI 0.99-2.98; with a statistically significant test for trend),652.4 (95% CI 1-6.1; with a statistically signifi- cant test tr end),671.1 (95% CI 0.9-1.2),68and 1.4 (95% CI 0.4-4.8) for men and 2.7 (95% CI 0.8-8.9) for women.69 All of the case-control studies showed increased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest,46 70- 72which was statistically significant in three.46 71 72Meta- analysis was possible on thr ee case-control studies, giving a summar y effect estimate of 1.11 (95% CI 1.08-1.15) per 20 g/day , with no heter ogeneity.46 71 72 The general mechanisms through which red meat could plausibly cause cancer are outlined below. In addition, boththe secr etory function of the pancreas and cell turnover with- in the pancreas are altered by the types of foods eaten. 73 Amino acids and fatty acids stimulate mor e pancr eatic secre- tions than do carbohydrates.74 Evidence from cohort studies is less consistent than that fr om case-contr ol studies. Ther e is limited evidence suggesting that red meat is a cause of pancreatic cancer. Endometrium One cohort study75and seven case-contr ol studies46 76-81 investigated r ed meat and endometrial cancer . The single cohort study showed a non-significant increased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the low-est, with an effect estimate of 1.10 (95% CI 0.70-1.73). 75Five case-control studies showed increased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest,46 76-79 which was statistically significant in two.77 78Two studies showed non-significant reduced risk.80 81Meta-analysis was possible on six studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.20 (95% CI 1.03-1.39) per 50 g red meat/day, with mod- erate heterogeneity.46 76-80 The general mechanisms through which red meat could plausibly cause cancer are outlined below. The evidence, mostly from case-control studies, is sparse. There is limited evidence suggesting that red meat is a cause of endometrial cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-control study82has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). General mechanisms There are several potential underlying mechanisms for an association between red meat consumption and cancer, including the generation by stomach and gut bacteria of potentially carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds. Some red meats are also cooked at high temperatures, resulting in theproduction of heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (box 4.3.4). Haem promotes the formation of N-nitroso compounds and also contains iron. Free iron can lead to pr oduction of free radicals (box 4.3.3).

Colorectum Fourteen cohort studies8-10 14-19 21 27 69 84 85and 44 case-control studies investigated processed meat and colorectal cancer. Twelve cohort studies showed increased risk for the high- est intake group when compared to the lowest (figure 4.3.5),8-10 14-19 21 27 69 85which was statistically significant in three.9 14 15 85One study reported non-significant decreased risk and one study reported that there was no effect on risk.84 Meta-analysis was possible on five studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.21 (95% CI 1.04-1.42) per 50 g/day,with low heterogeneity (figures 4.3.6 and 4.3.7). What het-erogeneity there is could be explained by the disparity in cat- egory definitions between studies, as well as by improved adjustment for confounders in recent studies. A dose-response r elationship was also appar ent fr om cohort studies that measured in times/day (figure 4.3.8). The majority of case-contr ol studies showed incr eased risk with increasing intake of processed meat. Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-controlstudies were not summarised. These data are supported by a recently published meta- analysis of 14 cohort studies, which reported a summaryeffect estimate of 1.09 (95% CI 1.05-1.13) per 30 g/day . 25 The general mechanisms thr ough which pr ocessed meat could plausibly cause cancer are outlined below. There is a substantial amount of evidence, with a dose- response relationship apparent from cohort studies.There is str ong evidence for plausible mechanisms operating in humans. Processed meat is a convincingcause of colorectal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, five cohort28 30 32 86 87and two case-contr ol studies36 88have been published.

Lung Four cohort studies52 69 95 96and 10 case-control studies33 55- 57 59 97-104investigated processed meat and lung cancer. Three cohort studies reported non-significant increased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the low- est.69 95 96One study reported no effect on risk.52 95Meta- analysis was possible on two of the studies, giving asummary effect estimate of 1.03 (95% CI 0.92-1.16) perserving/week, with no heterogeneity. 52All four cohort stud- ies adjusted for smoking.

The general mechanisms through which processed meat could plausibly cause cancer are outlined below. There is limited, inconsistent evidence suggesting that processed meat is a cause of lung cancer. Stomach cancer Eight cohort studies,51 69 105-11021 case-contr ecological study134inves- tigated processed meat and stomach cancer. Five cohort studies showed incr eased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest,51 106-108 110which was statistically significant in one.51Two studies reported non-significant decreased risk105 109; and one showed no effect on risk in men and non-significant decreased risk inwomen . 69Meta-analysis was possible on all eight cohort studies, giving a summar y effect estimate of 1.02 (95% CI 1.00-1.05) per 20 g/day , with no heter ogeneity. Thirteen case-control studies showed increased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest,49 113 117 119-121 124-132which was statistically significant in seven .120 125 128-132Three studies showed decreased risk,118 122 123which was statistically significant in one118; and one showed no effect on risk.116Four other studies r eported no significant difference between mean intakes in cases and controls.111 112 114 115Meta-analysis was possible on nine studies, giving a summar y effect estimate of 1.13 (95% CI 1.01-1.25) per 20 g/day, with high heterogeneity.49 117-119 121 123 128-130 A dose-response relationship is apparent from case-control but not cohort data. The single ecological study reports a statistically significant correlation between increased processed meat and stomach cancer risk.134 The general mechanisms through which processed meat could plausibly cause cancer are outlined below.The evidence is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that processed meat is a cause of stomachcancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort135and two case-control studies136 137have been pub- lished. This new information does not change the Panel judge- ment (see box 3.8). Prostate Four cohort studies138-141and six case-control studies142-147 investigated processed meat and prostate cancer. All four cohort studies showed increased risk for the high- est intake group when compared to the lowest,138-141which was statistically significant in two.139 141Meta-analysis was possible on all four cohort studies, giving a summary effectestimate of 1.11 (95% CI 0.995-1.25) per serving/week, with high heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was caused by vary- ing size, not direction, of effect. Two of these studies r eported separately on advanced or aggressive cancer. Both showed increased risk with increasing intak e of pr ocessed meat, 138 141which was statis - tically significant in one.141Meta-analysis was possible on both studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.09 (95%CI 0.98-1.22) per serving/week, with moderate hetero-geneity. Four case-control studies showed non-significant decreased risk with increasing intake of processed meat 143- 145 147; two showed non-significant incr eased risk.142 146Meta- analysis was possible on five case-control studies, giving asummar y effect estimate of 1.01 (95% CI 0.98-1.04) per serving/week, with low heterogeneity. 143-147The general mechanisms through which processed meat could plausiblycause cancer ar e outlined below . There is limited evidence from sparse and inconsistent studies suggesting that processed meat is a cause ofprostate cancer. The P anel is awar e that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies148 149have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). General mechanisms Nitrates are produced endogenously at the low pH in the stomach and ar e added as pr eservatives to processed meats, both of which may contribute to N-nitroso compound pr o- duction and exposure. N-nitroso compounds are suspected mutagens and carcinogens.150Many processed meats also contain high levels of salt and nitrite. Some pr ocessed meats are also cooked at high temperatures, resulting in the pro- duction of heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons. Red meat contains haem iron. Haem promotes the formation of N-nitroso compounds and also contains iron. Free iron can lead to production of free radicals (box 4.3.3). 125CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS 4.3.5.2 Poultry The evidence was too limited in amount, consistency, or quality to draw any conclusions. 4.3.5.3 Fish, shellfish Colorectum Nineteen cohort studies8-10 14-18 21 23 69 85 151-161and 55 case- control studies investigated fish and colorectal cancer. Nine cohort studies showed decreased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest,8 15-17 21 69 85 154 157 158 160which was statistically significant in two.15 16Eight studies showed non-significant increased risk.9 10 18 23 151-153 155 156 159One study showed no effect on risk14and one study reported that there was no statistically significant associa-tion. 161Meta-analysis was possible on seven cohort studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 0.96 (95% CI 0.92-1.00)per serving/week, with low heterogeneity. 8 9 14 18 21 158 160 Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. Heter ogeneity may be partially explained by var ying def - initions of fish in different studies that included fresh and/or salted or dried fish. It is also possible that high fish intak e is associated with low meat intake, which is a potential con- founder that has not been adjusted for. It is biologically plausible that fish n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) protect against cancer. Fish oils reducetumours in animal studies. 162Likely mechanisms are thought to revolve around their role in reduction of n-6 PUFA-derived eicosanoid biosynthesis (cyclooxygenase-2, an enzyme involved in the pr oduction of pr ostaglandins), which is also implicated in the cancer process (see Chapter 2). This mech- anism, though plausible, is not well supported.163Alternative suggestions include the r elatively high selenium or vitamin D content of fish. A substantial amount of data is available but the results are inconsistent, and residual confounding bymeat could not be ex cluded. There is limited evidence suggesting that eating fish pr otects against color ectal cancer . The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, six cohort28 30 164 165and two case-contr ol studies33 166have been published.

Adult intake The single cohort study showed increased risk for the high- est intak e group when compar ed to the lowest. Intake wasassessed in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The p value for trend for the association between each decade's intake and increased risk was < 0.001, 0.014, and 0.21, respectively. Seventeen of the case-control studies showed increased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the low- est,169-178 182-188which was statistically significant in nine.170 172 173 176 178 182 185-188One study showed a non-significant decreased risk168; three studies reported that there was no association.179-181Meta-analysis was possible on nine stud- ies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.28 (95% CI 1.13-1.44) per serving/ week, with high heterogeneity (fig- ure 4.3.9).

Nine case-contr ol studies that investigated the intak e of salted fish at 3 years of age showed incr eased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest, 171-174 177 188 189 194 195which was statistically significant in five.172 173 177 188 195One study showed no effect on risk.168Meta-analy - sis was possible on five studies,171 173 174 177 189giving a sum- mary effect estimate of 1.42 (95% CI per serving/week, with moderate heter ogeneity . Heter ogeneity was related to size, and not direction, of effect. A dose-response relationship is apparent from case-control data (figur e 4.3.11). Cohort and case-contr ol data suggest a delayed and/or cumulative effect from eating Cantonese- style salted fish. General mechanisms Evidence suggests that high intak e of nitrate and nitrosamine from salted fish accounts for some of this incr eased risk of nasopharyngeal cancer development. Nitrosamines are known mutagens and animal carcinogens that induce genemutation . The N-nitrosamines ar e a lar ge group of com-pounds with a common carcinogenic mechanism.150Salted fish has been shown to contain N-nitrosamines, with the highest levels in salted fish from areas with the highest mor- tality from nasopharyngeal cancer.196 197The variation in nitrosamine content of salted fish may contribute to hetero- geneity in assigning risk to salted fish consumption in dif- ferent geographic locations. There is also some evidence that genotype interacts with the risk associated with salted fish intake, particularly the gene for the cytochrome P450enzyme, CYP2E1. 192 198 Evidence from several case-control studies is consistent and shows a dose-response effect. There isevidence for plausible mechanisms. Cantonese-stylesalted fish is probably associated with increased risk ofnasopharyngeal cancer. 4.3.5.4 Eggs The evidence was too limited in amount, consistency, or quality to draw any conclusions. 4.3.5.5 Foods containing vitamin D Colorectum Eleven cohort studies17 24 154 199-210and 17 case-control stud- ies investigated total vitamin D and/or dietary vitamin D andcolorectal cancer. Four cohort studies investigated plasma orserum vitamin D. 22 210-212 Dietar y vitamin D Twelve estimates from 11 cohort studies reported analyses of the highest intak e groups compar ed to the lowest.17 154 199- of these showed non-significant decreased risk154 199- 202 205; 2 studies reported no effect on risk17 205; and 4 studies show non-significant incr eased risk.203 204 206Meta-analysis was possible on 9 studies that investigated dietary vitaminD, giving a summary effect estimate of 0.99 (95% CI0.97-1.00) per 100 IU/day, with moderate heterogeneity. 17 154 199 202 204-206 209 210 Serum or plasma vitamin D All four cohort studies showed non-significant decr eased risk for the highest intake groups when compared to the lowest.22 210-212Effect estimates were 0.73 CI 0.27-1.04).22 Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-contr ol studies wer e not summarised. The effects of vitamin D and calcium are strongly interre- lated because both are growth restraining, both induce dif-ferentiation and apoptosis in intestinal cells, and calcium- mediated effects are strongly dependent on vitamin D lev- els. Data fr om observational studies are probably hampered by the fact that total levels of the biologically active form ar e not only dependent on diet but also on supplements and UV exposure of the skin.

One cohort study investigated haem iron intake.218 The four cohort studies showed increased risk for the high- est intake group when compared to the lowest,214-216 218 which was statistically significant in two.214 218Effect esti- mates were 1.17 (95% CI study r eported a non-signif - icant higher intake in cancer cases (18.4 mg) than in con- trols (17.4 mg).215The other r eported that mean ir on intak es were similar between male colon cancer cases, rectal cancer cases, and male sub-cohort cases (13.2, 13.3, and 13.2 mgper day, respectively), and between female colon cancercases, rectal cancer cases, and female sub-cohort cases (11.4,11.6, and 11.7 mg/day, respectively). 217 Data suggest that the effect may be limited to pr oximal cancer cases and attenuated in distal cancer . Two studies reported results separately for proximal and distal colon can- cer cases.214-218The effect estimates for the former wer e 1.44 (95% CI 1.23-1.69)214and 2.18 (95% 0.90 (95% CI 0.45-1.81) for the latter .218 Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. It is biologically plausible that iron increases colorectal cancer risk due to its catalytic activity on the formation ofreactive oxygen species. Haem promotes the formation of N- nitroso compounds and also contains ir on. Free iron can lead to production of fr ee radicals (box 4.3.3). However, this role has not been confirmed in animal studies. Another hypoth- esis is that dietary ir on-induced hypo xia signalling.83 The evidence is sparse, of poor quality, and inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that foods containing ir on ar e in general a cause of colorectal cancer. (Also see chapter 4.3.5.1.1 for evidence on red and processed meat, which are classified as convincing causes of colorectal cancer.)

Fourteen case-control studies showed increased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest,118 220 221 224-235which was statistically significant in 11.118 224-234One study reported non-significant decreased risk222and 2 stud- ies reported no effect on risk.116 223More than half of the effect estimates were greater than 1.5. None of the studies adjusted for infection with Helicobacter pylori . One ecological study reported a statistically significant increased risk with higher intake of smoked foods236; the other reported decreased risk, though one constituent ofsmoked food (3,4-benzopyrene) was associated withincreased risk. 237 Heterogeneity may be partly explained by variation between studies in the definition of smoked foods \u2014 some were specific to smoked meats and most included meats. Smok ed foods, particularly meats, may contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, depending on the fuel burned to produce the smok e.238Smok ed meats ar e also often salted or cured, meaning that they are likely to raise endogenous production of N-nitroso compounds in the stomach (box 4.3.4). There is limited evidence from case-control and ecological studies, some of which wer e of poor quality, that smok ed foods ar e causes of stomach cancer. The P anel is awar e that since the conclusion of the SLR , three case-control studies136 137 239have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box3.8). 4.3.5.8 Grilled (broiled) or barbecued (charbroiled) animal foods cohort studies240-242and 12 case-contr ol studies inves- tigated grilled (br oiled) and barbecued (charbr oiled) foods and stomach cancer . Two cohort studies showed increased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest,240 242which was statistically significant in one.242One study r eported a non- significant reduced risk.241Effect estimates were 1.67 (p value for tr end < 0.05)242; 1.77 (95% CI 0.59-5.33) for grilled (br oiled) fish and 2.08 CI for grilled (broiled) meat240; and 0.84 CI 0.55-1.29).241None of the studies adjusted for H pylori infection. Eight case-contr ol studies showed incr eased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest,126 129 130 233 243 245-247which was statistically significant in seven. One study reported a statistically significant decreased risk121; two studies reported non-significant decreased risk220 248; and one study stated that ther e was no significant effect on risk.244 Charring or cooking meats over open flame generates het- erocyclic amines and polycyclic hydrocarbons, which maycause cancer (bo x 4.3.4). 128PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS There is limited, inconsistent evidence, mostly from case-control studies, that grilled (broiled) orbarbecued (charbroiled) animal foods are causes ofstomach cancer. 4.3.6 Comparison with previous report The panel responsible for the previous report judged that diets relatively high in red meat were probable causes of col- orectal cancer, and noted a pattern whereby red meat was a possible cause of cancers of the pancreas, breast, prostate, and kidney. The previous report considered methods of production, preservation, processing, and preparation (including cook-ing). Cured meats were judged to be a possible cause of col-orectal cancer; and grilled, barbecued, and fried meats, and other foods to be a possible cause of colorectal cancer; and grilling (broiling) and barbecuing (charbroiling) to be a pos-sible cause of stomach cancer . Processed meat was not iden - tified as such. The evidence on Cantonese-style salted fish was judged to be convincing for nasophar yngeal cancer . The panel noted that the risk was highest when this food is eaten frequently in early childhood. This Report concluded the evi-dence to be probable, in view of the paucity of prospectivedata Since the mid-1990s, the results of cohort studies have strengthened the evidence on red meat and processed meat as causes of color ectal cancer . 4.3.7 Conclusions The P anel concludes: The evidence on red meat and processed meat is stronger than in the mid-1990s. Epidemiological evidence on othermethods of preserving and preparing meats and other ani-mal foods is sparse, and the overall evidence remains sug-gestive, at most. The evidence on poultr y, fish, and eggs is generally insubstantial. The evidence that r ed meats and pr ocessed meats are a cause of colorectal cancer is convincing. Cantonese-style salted fish is a probable cause of nasopharyngeal cancer.This finding does not apply to any other type of fish product. Cantonese-style salted fish is also subject to fermentation . There is limited evidence suggesting that fish, and also foods containing vitamin D, protect against colorectal can- cer. There is limited evidence suggesting that red meat is acause of cancers of the oesophagus, lung, pancr eas and endometrium; that processed meat is a cause of cancers of the oesophagus, lung, stomach and prostate; and that foodscontaining iron are a cause of colorectal cancer. There is also limited evidence that foods that are grilled (broiled), bar- becued (charbr oiled), and smoked are a cause of stomach cancer . The evidence comes mostly fr om meat pr eserved or prepared in these ways. Meat, as mentioned above, is likely to be relatively high in animal fats. F or discussion of the r ole of animal fats oncancer, see chapter 4.4. Meat may also be energy dense. For discussion on the role of energy-dense foods on weight gain, overweight, and obesity, and the role of weight gain, over- weight, and obesity in the risk of some cancers, see Chapters6 and 8.129CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS Milk and products made from milk, such as cheese, butter, ghee, and yoghurt, have been consumed ever since suitableanimals were domesticated. Whole milk and cheese andyoghurt made from whole milk have a high proportion ofenergy from fat and from protein, although the absoluteconcentrations in liquid milk are lower than those in cheesedue to the higher water content. They also contain anumber of vitamins, including r etinol and riboflavin, and minerals, particularly calcium. In countries wher e consumption of milk and dairy products is high, these are the main sources of calcium. Low-fat dairy products retainall of the pr otein, the water-soluble vitamins, and the mineral content. However, the fat-soluble vitamins are significantly r educed. L ow-fat milk or whole milk is sometimes fortified with vitamins A and D. Until the late 19th century, milk from animals was used as asubstitute for human milk for feeding infants. Adults did not usually consume such milks; if they did, it was in low amounts. Populations that kept milk-giving animals consumed other dairy products. From the early 20th century, a number of factors were responsible for cow's milkbecoming almost a staple food in the USA and someEuropean countries. These included the industrialisation of cattle farming; the identification of milk as a basic food,especially for children; and the development of refrigerationtechniques and ultra-heat treated packaging. Dried milk isnow a common ingr edient in many pr ocessed foods. Overall, the Panel judges that the evidence on milk and dairy pr oducts, and on calcium, shows that their impact on the risk of cancer varies in different tissues. The Panel judges as follows: Milk probably protects against colorectal cancer. There islimited evidence suggesting that milk pr otects against bladder cancer .Thereis limited evidence suggesting that cheese is a cause of color ectal cancer .Diets high in calcium are a probable cause of prostate cancer; and there is limited evidence suggesting that high consumption ofmilk and dairy pr oducts is a cause of prostate cancer. The strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of 'convincing' and 'pr obable', shows that milk pr obably protects against color ectal cancer ,and that diets high in calcium are a probable cause of prostate cancer. Milk and dairy products are important components of diets in some but not all parts of the world. Until recently in his-tory, milk from several ruminant animals was used as a par- tial substitute for or in addition to human milk; but these milks wer eusually consumed infrequently and, if at all, later in childhood or by adults. In countries wher emilk-giving animals were raised, their products were consumed in the form of cheese, butter, ghee, and in fermented form asyoghurts or in combination with alcoholic drinks. 4.4 Milk and dairy products MILK, DAIRY PRODUCTS, AND THE RISK OF CANCER In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence.

Most data are from high-income populations, where calcium can be taken to be a marker for milk/dairy consumption. The Panel judges that a higher intake of dietary calcium is one way in which milk could have a protective effect. 2 Effect only apparent at high calcium intakes (around 1.5 g/day or more). Evidence for milk and dairy products (but not calcium) was derived only from data for countries with populations that have high calcium and dairy consumption. 3Includes diets that naturally contain calcium and that contain foods for tified with calcium. See box 4.10.1. 4Although both milk and cheese are included in the general category of dairy products, their different nutritional composition and consumption patter ns may r esult in different findings. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. 130PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS From the late 19th century, consumption of cow's milk greatly increased in the USA, the UK, and some other European countries. This was a result of a massive increase in dairy farming supported by new techniques such as con-densation, drying, and cooling. In the 20th century, consumption was further boosted by pasteurisation and doorstep delivery, the decline of breastfeeding, and the com- mon view that modified cow's milk is a suitable food for infants and an excellent food for young children. Dried milkis a mainstay of programmes of food aid to impoverished countries. However, populations living outside North America and northern Europe have until recently consumed little milk as such, and dairy products consumed are in the form of yoghurt or products derived from it. This may be due to thelimited capacity to digest lactose beyond infancy observed inthese populations. Yoghurt is fermented, which lowers lactoseconcentration, and is therefore better tolerated. Reports in the early part of the 20th century of different forms of malnutrition in young children, which documentedarequir ement for high amounts of animal pr otein to cur e these conditions, supported the categorisation of milk, eggs, and meat as pr otective foods. By contrast, r eports published since the 1960s have identified whole milk and dairy prod- ucts, which have a high proportion of energy from fat and sat-urated fatty acids, as foods that contribute to the pathogenesisof coronary heart disease. More recently, some reports con-cerned with the prevention of osteoporosis in Western pop-ulations have r ecommended high intakes of calcium. This chapter is concerned with milk and its pr oducts. The evidence on milk is on milk from cows, and the evidence on cheese is fr om all sour ces. It does not consider human milk or infant formula. For human milk, see chapter 4.11. Nor does it consider soya drinks or other plant-derived alternatives. Forsoya drinks, see chapter 4.2. F or butter ,see chapter 4.5. Calcium is included here because in countries where milk and dairy products are important in diets, these are the mainsources of what is a generally high intake of calcium. Dietarycalcium also comes from bones when these are consumed(small or tinned fish, for example, and in stews), egg shells,and fr om some plant foods. In many countries, plant foods arethe main sour ce of calcium. See chapters 4.1, 4.2, and 4.4. 4.4.1 Definitions, sour ces Milk is pr oduced by all mammal species to suckle their young. It has evolved to be the ideal nourishment for mam - malian infants of each species and, in normal conditions, contains all the nutrients they need at that stage of theirlives. Although all mammal species pr oduce milk, only a few are employed widely as milk producers, and they are all ruminants. Milk from other species must be modified beforefeeding to infants to allow for their limited capacity to metabolise and excrete nitrogenous compounds and salts in early life. Ruminant animals have a lar ge, multichamber ed stomach that contains microbes, which allows them to ferment cel- lulose and extract nutrients from green and dried grasses.Some species or br eeds (notably Eur opean cows) have beenbred to produce copious amounts of milk. Around the world, other bovine animals used to supply milk include zebu cows in Asia, water buffalo in Asia and some parts of Europe, and yaks, although usually only in the mountainous regions inAsia. Goats and sheep are also important and widespread milk-producing animals, as well as camels, which live in arid climates around the world. In some areas of the world, other animals such as horses, old- and new-world camels, and rein- deer are locally important. Fresh milk can be consumed raw (untreated) or, as is com- mon in many high-income countries, pasteurised (see chap- ter 4.9.3). Milk is also commonly processed into a wide variety of foods including cream, concentrated milks, cheese, fats such as butter and ghee, and fermented foodssuch as yoghurt. 4.4.2 Composition Milk and dair yproducts in whole form have a high pr opor- tion of energy from fat and protein, and contain some vita- mins and minerals.1The pr ecise composition varies between species and breeds, and with the nature of their feed. Sheep and yak milks are particularly high in protein; buffalo, sheep,and yak milks are high in fat. Typical whole cow's milk con-tains 3.4 g protein and 3.6 g fat per 100 g. 1Reduced fat (semi-skimmed) and low-fat (skimmed) milks are producedfrom whole milk, and the foods made from these milks have acorrespondingly lower fat and fat-soluble vitamin content than those made from whole milk. Around two thir ds of the fatty acids in cow 's milk ar esat- urated. Polyunsaturated fatty acids make up less than 4 per cent of milk fat (see chapter 4.5.2). Fat accounts for half ofthe ener gy in whole milk. Milk contains all the essential amino acids in the appropriate proportions for humans (see chapter 4.10.1). The only significant carbohydrate found in milk is the disaccharide lactose. Milk products such as cheese andyoghurt contain var ying amounts of lactose. Hard cheeses contain only traces, soft cheeses 2-3 per cent, yoghurts 4 percent, compar ed to 5 per cent found in whole milk; this is because cheese and yoghurt have been fermented by bacte- ria used in the production of these foods. Milk, cheese, and yoghurt contain high levels of calcium (box 4.4.1). They are also sources of riboflavin and vitamin B12, and full-fat dair yproducts are sources of retinol, and to a lesser extent, other fat-soluble vitamins. Milk also con - tains several growth factors and hormones, though these are probably digested in the stomach. However, milk consump-tion has been shown to elevate cir culating levels of insulin- like growth factor. 4.4.3 Consumption patterns Consumption of milk and dair yproducts thr oughout the world is highly variable. The overall global average of around 5per cent of available dietary energy2conceals wide varia- tions. The range is fr om 10-15 per cent of dietar yenergy in 131CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS the US Aand some Eur opean countries to less than 0.5 per cent in some African and Asian countries. 4.4.4 Interpretation of the evidence 4.4.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpr etation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7 'Relative risk' (RR) is used in this Report to denote ratio measures of effect, and 'odds ratios'. 4.4.4.2 Specific Patterns and ranges of intake .Most studies are carried out in high-income countries where consumption of cow's milkand its pr oducts is high, and where the main dairy product consumed is milk. Classification .Studies usually do not make any distinction between dairy products, such as cheeses from differentsources and with different compositions. 4.4.5 Evidence and judgements The full systematic literature review (SLR) is contained on the CD included with this R eport. 4.4.5.1 Milk and dairy products Prostate Ten cohort studies,4-1513 2 eco- logical 10 32-4011 case-con - 41-51and 11 ecological studies30 31 52-61 investigated milk.Milk and dairy products Seven cohort studies showed increased risk with increased intake of milk and dairy products,468-11 13 15which was statistically significant in two.610Two studies showed non- significant decreased risk512 14;and one study showed no effect on risk.7Meta-analysis was possible on eight studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.11) per serving/day, with moderate heterogeneity.4-12 Five of these cohort studies reported separately on advanced/aggressive prostate cancer.57910 12Two studies showed increased risk with increased intake of milk and dairy products,910which was statistically significant in one.9 Three studies showed non-significant decreased risk.5712 Meta-analysis was possible on four studies, giving a sum- mary effect estimate of 1.00 (95% CI 0.94-1.06) per serv-ing/day, with low heterogeneity. 5710 12The study that could not be included in the meta-analysis was inconsistent with this result, reporting an effect estimate of 2.35 (95% CI1.29-4.26) per ser ving/day incr ease (dr yweight). 9 Eight case-control studies showed increased risk with increased intak eof milk and dair yproducts,1619-21 23 24 26 28 which was statistically significant in one. 28Four studies showed non-significant decreased risk1718 22 25 27;and one study reported that there was no statistically significanteffect on risk. 29Meta-analysis was possible on five relative- ly high-quality studies, giving a summary effect estimate of1.03 (95% CI per ser ving/day, with low hetero- geneity . 16-20 One ecological study showed no significant association, with an age-adjusted corr elation coefficient of -0.49.30One other ecological study reported no statistically significant effect.31 Therearemany separate exposur es being measur ed with - in this broad category, which may explain the observed het- erogeneity. Adose-response relationship is apparent from cohort data on all prostate cancer, but not from cohort data onadvanced/aggr essive prostate cancer or case-control data. Milk Six cohort studies showed increased risk with increased intake of milk,6833 36 37 39which was statistically significant in one.6Three studies showed no effect on risk32 34 35and one study showed non-significant decreased risk.14The remain- ing six studies did not r eport quantified r esults, but stated results wer enot statistically significant.5710 12 38 40Meta- analysis was possible on eight studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.05 (95% CI 0.98-1.14) per serving/day,with low heter on advanced/aggressive prostate cancer.712 33 36 39 40Three studies showed increased risk with increased intake of milk, with effect estimates of 1.30 (95% CI 1.04-1.61) per serving/day36;2.8 (in men aged 72.5 years or less, for the highest intak egroups com- pared to the lowest, with no CI r eported)33;and an incr eased risk with a p value for trend of 0.005.39Three studies did not report quantified results but stated that there was no sig-nificant association . 712 40 In countries with high intakes of milk and dairy products, these are the main source of calcium. Most of the epidemiological studies reviewed here are from those countries. Calcium is found in plant as well as in animal foods, but it is less easily absorbed. Other animal sources include small fish (when eaten with their bones) and meat (when rendered on the bone in stews). Plant sources include green vegetables, nuts, and pulses(legumes). 13 Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body and is the major mineral constituent of bones. It is central to a variety offunctions in the body, such as bone metabolism, nerve and mus- cle activity, and the control of cell differentiation and prolifer- ation. Calcium metabolism is controlled by various factors,including vitamin D and related hormonal compounds formed by the liver and kidney, necessary for the absorption of calcium from foods, and its regulation in the body.Box 4.4.1 Foods containing calcium132PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Seven case-control studies showed increased risk with increased intake of milk,2741-44 47-51which was statistically significant in three (including the single relatively high qual- ity study).41 43 44 47Two studies showed non-significant decreased risk21 45;one study reported no effect on risk46and one study stated that there was no significant association but did not present results.26Meta-analysis was possible on six relatively low quality studies, giving a summary effect esti- mate of 1.08 (95% CI 0.98-1.19) per serving/day, heterogeneity. direc- tion of increased risk.31 52 54-61One study did not provide a quantified result, but stated there was no statistically sig- nificant association.53One study showed a non-significant decreased risk in areas of increased intake.30 Milk could plausibly cause prostate cancer through the actions of calcium (see chapter 4.4.5.1.1). Also, consump- tion of milk increases blood levels of insulin-like growth fac- tor-1, which has been associated with increased prostatecancer risk in some studies. 6263 The evidence is inconsistent fr om both cohort and case-control studies. There is limited evidencesuggesting that milk and dairy products are a cause ofprostate cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies64 65and one case-contr ol study66have been pub - lished. This new information does not change the P anel judge - ment (see box 3.8). 4.4.5.1.1 Milk Colorectum Thirteen cohort studies67-82and 36 case-contr ol studies inves - tigated milk and colorectal cancer. Fifteen cohort studies72- 77 79 80 82-101and 58 case-control studies investigated dietary calcium.

Dietar ycalcium intake can be interpreted as a marker of dairyintak eonly in those populations (usually European, Australian, or from the Americas) that consume relatively regular and lar ge amounts of milk and dair yproducts. Other dietary sources of calcium include vegetables, nuts, pulses, and fish or meat cooked on the bone (box 4.4.1). The general mechanisms thr ough which milk could plau - sibly protect against cancer are outlined below.The evidence on milk from cohort studies is reasonably consistent, supported by stronger evidence fromdietary calcium as a dietary marker. There is evidencefor plausible mechanisms. Milk probably protectsagainst colorectal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, three cohort80103 104and three case-control studies66105 106have been published. This new information does not change the Paneljudgement (see box 3.8). Bladder cancer Five cohort studies,34 107-11114 case-control studies,48 112-124 and 1 ecological study56investigated milk and bladder cancer. All five cohort studies showed decreased risk with increased intake of milk,34 107-111which was statistically sig- nificant in one.108Meta-analysis was possible on four stud- ies, giving a summary effect estimate of 0.82 (95% CI0.67-0.99) per ser 108-110 Seven case-contr ol studies showed decr eased risk with increased intake of milk,48 112 115-117 121 122which was statis- tically significant 117 122Four studies showed non-significant increased risk,113 114 120 123and three studies stated that there was no significant association.118 119 124 Meta-analysis was possible on three relatively high-quality case-contr ol studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.00 (95% CI 0.87-1.14) per ent fr om cohort, but not case-control data. The single ecological study reported a correlation of 0.45 between milk consumption and death fr om bladder cancer .56 The general mechanisms through which milk could plau- sibly protect against cancer are outlined below. The evidence is inconsistent and comes mainly from evidence on dietary calcium. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting that milk pr otects against bladder cancer . General mechanisms \u2014 milk The probable effect of milk in reducing cancer risk is likely to be mediated at least in part by calcium. Calcium fr om diet is an import micronutrient, and intracellular calcium direct- ly influences cell gr owth and apoptosis. Calcium may also bind to bile and fatty acids, pr eventing them fr om damag - ing the intestinal lining.125Milk includes many bioactive con- stituents, however, which may also play a role. 4.4.5.1.2 Cheese Colorectum Eleven cohort studies67 68 70 72 74 78-80 82 126-128and 25 case- control studies investigated cheese and colorectal cancer.

Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. Nospecific mechanism has been identified but cheese could plausibly cause colorectal cancer through the indirect mechanisms connected to saturated fats. Saturated fatsintake increases insulin production and expression of insulin receptors on colonic cells. 129Saturated fats can also induce expression of certain inflammatory mediators associated with carcinogenesis.130 Epidemiological evidence for cheese intake is consistent- ly in contrast to the probable protective effect from milk. The evidence is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that cheese is a cause of colorectal cancer. The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR ,two cohort studies66 103 104and one case-control study66have been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement (see box 3.8). 4.4.5.2 Diets high in calcium For evidence on calcium supplements, see chapter 4.10.6.4.4. Calcium is a good mark er for dairy intake in Western diets. In areas outside the US A, Europe, and Oceania, dairy prod- ucts are not as widely consumed and the range of calcium intak eis smaller (see also bo x4.4.1).

Seven cohort studies showed increased risk with increased intake of dietary calcium,4-7 10 11 131 133which was statistical- ly ee.610 133Two studies showed non-signif- icant decr eased risk, including the only unadjusted study .8 132Meta-analysis was possible on eight cohort studies, giv - ing a summary effect estimate of 1.27 (95% CI 1.09-1.48) per g/day, with moderate heterogeneity.5-8 10 11 131-133 Four of these cohort studies reported separately on advanced/aggressive prostate cancer.5710 133Three studies showed incr eased risk with incr eased intake of milk and dairyproducts,710 133which was statistically significant in one.133One study showed non-significant decreased risk.5 Meta-analysis was possible on all four studies, giving a sum- maryeffect estimate of 1.32 (95% CI 1.05-1.64) per g/day , with moderate heterogeneity.5710 133 Six case-control studies showed non-significant decreased risk with increased intake of dietary calcium.18 134 136 138-140 143 144Five studies showed increased risk,19 23 24 135 137 141 which was statistically significant in one19 138;and one other study showed no effect on risk.142Meta-analysis was possi - ble on three relatively high-quality studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.16 (95% CI 0.64-2.14) per gram ofcalcium/day ,with high heter ogeneity . 18 19 134Adose-response relationship was apparent from cohort but not case-control data. One ecological study from Germany showed a significant increased risk of prostate cancer with higher calciumintakes. 146Another study from Taiwan reported a non- significant decreased risk with higher calcium intakes.145 High calcium intake downregulates the formation of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D(3) from vitamin D, thereby increasing cell proliferation in the prostate.7Prostate cancer tumours in rats treated with 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D(3) were sig- nificantly smaller and presented smaller numbers of lung metastases.147 The evidence, from both cohort and case-control studies, is substantial and consistent with a dose-response relationship. There is evidence for plausiblemechanisms. Diets high in calcium are a probable cause of prostate cancer. The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR ,two cohort studies64 65have been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement (see bo x3.8). 4.4.6 Comparison with previous report The previous report judged that milk and dairy products pos- sibly incr ease the risk of prostate and kidney cancer. Calcium was judged possibly not to affect the risk of color ectal can - cer. Since the mid-1990s, more evidence has emerged on prostate cancer ,and that for kidney cancer is now incon - clusive. 4.4.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The evidence on the relationship between milk and dairyproducts, and also diets high in calcium, and the risk of can- cer,points in differ ent directions. Milk pr obably pr otects against colorectal cancer; there is limited evidence suggesting that milk protects against blad- der cancer. But there is limited evidence suggesting thatcheese is a cause of color ectal cancer. Diets high in calcium are a probable cause of prostate can- cer;thereis limited evidence suggesting that high con- sumption of milk and dair yproducts is a cause of pr ostate cancer. 135CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS Fats and oils are the most energy-dense constituents of food supplies and diets. Their contribution to total dietaryenergy increases with industrialisation and urbanisation.Meat from most industrially bred animals is higher in fatthan that fr om wild animals, and such meat fats, together with fat from milk and dairy products, are a major sourceof fat in most high-income countries. Many processedfoods contain substantial amounts of oils from plantsources. Production and consumption of animal fats andoil fr omplant sources have greatly increased in recent decades, most of all in China and elsewher ein Asia. In general, the P anel judges that ther eis only limited evidence suggesting that diets relatively high in fats and oils (in total, or any type) are in themselves a cause of anycancer .This judgement contrasts with those of some earlier reports, which concluded from evidence then available that diets high in fats and oils might be asubstantial cause of some cancers. Overall, the evidencedoes not suggest that diets relatively high in fats and oilsmight protect against the risk of any cancer. The Panel judges as follows: There is limited evidence suggesting that total fat is a cause of lung cancer, and of postmenopausal breastcancer; that animal fat is a cause of colorectal cancer; and that consumption of butter is a cause of lung cancer . The P anel str esses that the principal cause of lung cancer is tobacco smoking. The evidence on fats and oils does not justify any judgement of 'convincing' or 'pr obable'. F or discussion ofthe role of fats and oils in energy-dense foods and drinks, the effect of ener gy-dense foods and drinks on weight gain, overweight, and obesity, and the role of weight gain,overweight, and obesity in the risk of some cancers, seeChapters 6 and 8. Fats or oils may be an intrinsic part of the plant or animal, as contained in the germ of cereals (grains) and the tissuesof animals, or extracted and added to food in manufactur e, cooking, or at the table. Production and consumption of fats and oils in general rises with industrialisation and urbanisation, and in partic- ular with the extent to which animal production is intensi-fied, milk and dair yproducts are consumed, and processed foods include extracted oils. Availability and price are also key factors. In lower -income countries, average population consumption of fat may amount to less than 15 per cent,though usually to 20-30 per cent of total energy; in high- income countries, usually to 30-40 per cent. On a globalbasis, and most notably in China and elsewher ein Asia, pr o- duction and consumption of animal fats and plant oils are increasing. Early reports issued in the context of food insecurity in industrialised countries, including Europe and North America, r ecommended maintenance and even an increase in consumption of fats and oils. In the second half of the 20thcentury, reports on fats, oils, and chronic diseases tended to focus on the possible role of diets relatively high in fats andoils in the causation of obesity ,type 2 diabetes, cor onary 4.5 Fats and oils FATS, OILS, AND THE RISK OF CANCER Inthe judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer.

In recent decades, more attention has been given to issues of the nutritional quality of fats and oils. Distinctions are made between rela- tively saturated (including hydrogenated) fats, such as frommeat, milk, and their products, or from hydrogenated oils in baked goods and many other processed foods; relatively monounsaturated oils, notably olive oil; and relatively polyunsaturated oils, from seeds, nuts, fish, and other sources, some of which \u2014 like vitamins \u2014 are essential tohuman health and life. These distinctions are to some extent reflected in the studies reviewed here. For discussion of the role of fats and oils in energy-dense foods and drinks, the effect of energy-dense foods and drinks on weight gain, overweight, and obesity, and the role ofweight gain, overweight, and obesity in the risk of some can-cers, see Chapters 6 and 8. In this Report, fats and oils are classified as foods. This sec- tion also covers dietary cholesterol, as well as total fat and individual fatty acids as dietary constituents. Food process-es affecting the composition of fats and oils, such as hydr o- genation, are also covered here. 4.5.1 Definitions and sources Dietary fat is mostly made up of triglycerides (three fatty acid molecules attached to a glycerol backbone). Triglycerides arelipids, a class of hydr ocarbon-containing organic compounds, which also includes cholester ol. Lipids ar eused by plants, animals, and humans as a means of storing energy, as struc- tural components of cell membranes, and as pr ecursors of important hormones. Fatty acids are classified as either 'saturated' or 'unsatu- rated', depending on their chemical structur e(see chapter 4.5.2), and these differences determine their shape and phys- ical properties. Fats high in saturated fatty acids are gener-ally solid at room temperature, whereas those rich inunsaturated fatty acids are liquid. Trans -fatty acids, formed in a pr ocess called hydrogenation (box 4.5.1), are physical- ly mor elikesaturated fats (harder at lower temperatures), and have similar effects on the body . The term 'fats' is often used for fats and for oils. Fats can be classified according to their source, use, or chemical com-position .Those that are solid or semisolid at ambient tem- perature are generally high in saturated fatty acids and are often of animal origin; and oils, which ar efrom plant and marine sour ces, ar eliquid at ambient temperatur ein their places of origin. Palm oil and coconut oil, which are relatively high in saturated fatty acids, are semisolid in temperate cli-mates but liquid in the tr opics, wher ecoconut and other palm trees grow (also see chapter 4.5.2). Fats and oils are eaten as part of animal and plant foods, are contained in manufactured foods, used for cooking, and may be added at the table. Animal fats include tallow, lard, and suet, pr oduced as part of the slaughtering process, and butter .Margarine and other fat spr eads ar emade fr om fish and plant oils. Plant oils are extracted from oily fruits (such as olives), seeds (such as rape and sunflower), nuts (suchas walnuts), and other sour ces. Asmall amount of dietary fat is essential to allow absorp- tion of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and to provide the essential fatty acids that cannot be made by the body. Fat also helps food to taste more interesting and be morepalatable, for instance in terms of its texture. Linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid are the two essential fatty acids, and are found in vegetables, nuts, and seed oils; lower levels are also found in meat, eggs, and dairy products. Oily fish also contain long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, which influenceinflammatory processes in the body. instance, eicos- apentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, and related fatty acids, are precursors to prostaglandins, which are hormone- like compounds with diverse effects, including roles in blood vessel dilation and constriction, blood clotting, and inflam-mation. Cholesterol is found only in foods of animal origin, such as cheese, butter, meat, seafood, and egg yolks. Most of the cholesterol in the body is manufactured in the liver, rather than coming from these dietary sources. 1The proportion and types of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids eaten in the diet are more important influences on cholesterol meta-bolism than the amount of dietar ycholester ol. 4.5.2 Composition The properties of fats and oils are determined by the length and structur eof the fatty acids they contain. Liquid oils tend to be higher in unsaturated fatty acids, wher eas mor esolid fats have more saturated fatty acids. Whether or not a fatty acid is saturated depends on the chemical bonds that join together the chain of carbon atoms that forms the backbone of the molecule. Saturated fattyacids have only single bonds, wher eas unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond between two adjacent carbon atoms. Monounsaturated fatty acids have only one doublebond; polyunsaturated fatty acids have two or more doublebonds. The position of the first double bond along the car-bon chain is denoted by an 'n '. Thus linoleic acid is 'n-6' and alpha-linolenic acid is 'n-3'. These wer epreviously known as 'omega-6' and 'omega-3' fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids are long and straight, forming well ordered, relatively solid structures. But each of the doublebonds in an unsaturated fatty acid causes the carbon chain to kink; and the more kinks, the less well they pack togeth- er,which means they form less solid structur es. So, saturat- ed fats ar eusually solid at r oom temperatur eand unsaturated fats are liquid (oils). Trans -fatty acids are unsat- urated fatty acids formed by a process called hydrogenation,which r emoves and r econfigur es the double bonds, making the carbon chain less kinked. Plant oils can be turned into saturated fats by this process, which, when only partiallycomplete, also leads to production of trans -fatty acids (box 4.5.1). Fats from ruminants (cattle and sheep) contain more saturated fatty acids than pork or poultr yfats. F ats from under the skin have a smaller proportion of saturated fatty acids than fats stored around the organs. Beef suet is the har dest culinar yfat, while chick en, duck, and 137CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS goose fats are semiliquid at room temperature. In general, the amount and type of body fat carried by ani - mals and poultry depend on how they live, and this deter- mines the fat content of their meat, unless some of it hasbeen removed during processing. Wild and free-living landanimals and birds are lean, and much of their fat is unsatu-rated; domesticated animals and birds carry more fat, whichis higher in saturated fatty acids. Indeed, they ar eoften bred to be mor efatty,so that their meat is more succulent. 4.5.3 Consumption patterns Consumption of total fats and oils varies gr eatly thr oughout the world. Average intake of total fat is highest (30-40 per cent of total energy) in most urbanised and industrialisedregions such as Europe, North America, Australia, and NewZealand, where people consume relatively more meat andmilk and their pr oducts. By contrast, fat usually accounts for only 20-30 per cent of total ener gy in lower -income parts of the world, for instance in Africa, Asia, and Latin America;this may be even lower in rural areas, where people consume low levels of added fats or oils (for instance, from processedfoods). However ,in general, consumption of fats \u2014 and in particular plant oils \u2014 is increasing in middle- and low- income countries. (Also see Chapter 1.) Higher amounts of separated animal fats (as distinct fr om the fats that are naturally components of foods of animal ori- gin) are consumed in high-income countries. Availability istypically highest in North America, northern Eur ope, Australia, and New Zealand \u2014 as much as 10 per cent in parts of northern Europe, compared with less than 0.5 percent in much of Africa and Asia. 3 More plant oils are also consumed in high-income coun- tries; availability is highest in North America, southernEurope and some parts of the Middle East, and lowest in parts of Asia and Africa. Greece has the highest level of con- sumption \u2014 almost 20 per cent of dietary energy \u2014 com-pared with 1.4 per cent in Laos. Soya bean oil is the most widely consumed oil in the world, particularly in North America, as well as in some Asian and African countries. Sunflower seed oil is the sec- ond most widely consumed vegetable oil (particularly inEurope, South Africa, Argentina, Chile, and New Zealand)and palm oil the third (particularly in some African, Asian,and Latin American countries, as well as in Australia). Oliveoil is the most widely consumed oil in southern Eur ope (par- ticularly in Gr eece, Italy ,and Spain). Rapeseed oils are most common in northern Europe and Canada, while groundnut oil is common in some African countries. The industrial revolution brought significant changes to food supplies, methods of food production, and hence peo-ple's diets (see chapter 1.1.3). Befor ethen,it is thought that the amounts of n-6 and n-3 oils in diets had been roughly equal. But with the move to urban-industrial ways of life,vegetable oils (which are predominantly n-6) became cheapand widely available. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids isnow thought to be between 10 and 20 to 1 in many high-income countries. 4 The W orld Health Or ganization recommends limiting aver- age fat intake for populations to between 15 and 30 per cent of total daily energy intake, and saturated fatty acids to lessthan 10 per cent. 5In higher -income countries, fat con- sumption as a percentage of total energy has been decreas- ing for some time. However ,this is no longer the case in some countries such as the US A,wher ethe per centage of energy from fat has started to increase again. 4.5.4 Interpretation of the evidence 4.5.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and bo xes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' (RR) is used in this Report to denote ratio measures of effect, including 'risk ratios', 'rate ratios', 'haz-ardratios', and 'odds ratios'. The main single factor that has increased production and consumption of total fatand saturated fatty acids throughout the world, and therefore the energy density of food supplies, is the industrial process of hydrogenation, invented at the beginning of the 20th century. 2The hydrogenation process was at first used mostly for the manufacture of margarine, but it is now used in the manufacture of many pro-cessed foods supplied and consumed throughout the world. Complete hydrogenation converts the unsaturated fatty acids in oils of plant and marine origin into saturated fatty acids. This process has two commercial benefits.First, it greatly extends 'shelf-life': oils high in unsaturated fatty acids become rancid,whereas fats high in saturated fatty acids 'keep' for very much longer. Second, it enables conversion of whatever plant and marine oils are cheapest at the time into a uniform, reliable ingredient and product. Partial hydrogenation produces trans - fatty acids, which, although chemically unsaturated, physiologically behave morelike saturated fatty acids. For instance, high levels in the diet increase the risk of coro- nary heart disease. Biscuits and other bakedgoods may contain as much as 25 per cent or more of their fats in trans form. Small amounts of trans- fats are also naturallyfound in milk and butter. Because of the evidence on coronary heart disease, regulatory authorities in many countries now require food manu- facturers to list trans -fatty acid content on nutrition labels of processed foods. Hydrogenated fats found in foods, andlabelled as such, are hydrogenated to a variable extent and may therefore contain unspecified amounts of trans- fatty acids. This may not be clear on labels where a dec- laration of trans- fatty acid content is not required. The Panel notes that any effect of trans- fatty acids specifically on the risk of any cancer is not known. Box 4.5.1 Hydrogenation and trans-fatty acids 138PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 4.5.4.2 Specific Some considerations specific to fats and oils are as follows. Patterns and ranges of intake. In high-income countries where most studies are undertaken, average consumption of fats and oils is relatively high and variation in consumption isnot great. Classification . Studies tend to use classifications relevant to coronary heart disease, some of which may not be relevant tocancer. Thus, they examine not only animal and vegetable fats; meat, fish, and dairy fats; but also individual fatty acids. This makes aggregation andanalysis of intakes of fats and oils as a whole, problematic. Study design . Practically all studies have analysed con- sumption of fats and oils as an issue of quantity (percentageof total ener gy intak e) rather than nutritional quality (effect ofdifferent types of fats and oils). But oils are complex mix- tures of nutrients and other bioactive compounds, some of which may have harmful effects on cancer risk and others beneficial effects. Reporting bias. The use of questionnaires to record con- sumption of fats and oils may change behaviour. As peoplebecome mor econscious of what they consume, they tend to under -report true consumption of foods and drinks they regard as unhealthy, including fats and oils. So studies using questionnair es may dispr oportionately under estimate con - sumption of fats and oils. 4.5.5 Evidence and judgements The relationship between the risk of cancer and fat and oil intake may be assessed as weight of fat consumed or adjust-ed for total ener gy intake, so that fat is assessed as a pro- portion of total dietar yenergy. 6Wher ethis is the case, this has been stated below . The full systematic literature review (SLR) is contained on the CD included with this Report. 4.5.5.1 Total fats Lung Nine cohort studies,7-1517 case-contr ol studies,16-32and 4 ecological studies33-36investigated total fat and lung cancer. (Also see chapter 7.4.) Six cohort studies showed non-significant incr eased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest.7810 11 13 14Three studies showed decreased risk,912 15which was statistically significant in one.15Meta-analysis was possible on two cohort studies, with a summary effect estimate of 1.01 (95% confidence inter val (CI) 0.94-1.09) per 10 g fat/day, with high heter ogeneity .11 12Six of the studies adjusted for smoking, including the two studies in the meta-analysis and not including the statistically significant reduced risk.7-12 Pooled analysis fr om 8 cohort studies (over 43 0 000 partici-pants, followed up for 6 to 16 years, more than 3100 lung can- cer cases) showed a non-significant increased risk of 1.01 (95% CI 0.98-1.05) per 5 per cent daily energy intake from fat.37 Twelve of the case-control studies showed increased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest,16 17 19- 21 23 25 27-29 31 32which was statistically significant in five.1617 19-21 25 31Nostudies reported statistically significant reduced risk. Most (12) of these studies adjusted for smoking.1619-22 24 25 27 30-32 The ecological studies reported mixed results, most of which were not statistically significant.33-35One study reported a sta- tistically significant decreased risk with increased fat intake.36 Although no evidence for plausible mechanisms was found, based on the epidemiological evidence, there is limited evi-dence suggesting that total fat is a cause of lung cancer. The mixed results from cohort studies contrast with the more consistent results from other studies. Overall, there is limited evidence suggesting that consumptionof total fat is a cause of lung cancer . The P anel emphasises that the principal cause of lung cancer is smoking tobacco. Breast (all ages) Nineteen cohort studies,38-6049 case-control studies,61-118and 10 ecological studies119-128investigated total fat intake and breast cancer. Breast (pr emenopause) Total fat intake for all ages, and also for premenopausal breast cancer ,did not give any overall indication of effect. Breast (postmenopause) Nine cohort studies38 40 43 45 50-52 57-59and 16 case-contr ol stud - ies62-65 75 79 85 86 96-98 101 102 109 110 112 116reported results specif- ically for postmenopausal breast cancer. Six cohort studies showed increased risk with increasing fat intake,38 40 45 50-52 59which was statistically significant in three.38 51 52Three studies reported non-significant reduced risk.40 43 57 58Meta-analysis was possible on five cohort stud - ies, giving a summar yestimate of 1.06 (95% CI 0.99-1.14) per 20 g/day, with moderate heterogeneity.38 43 45 50 51 Pooling project data (7329 invasive postmenopausal breast cancer cases among 351 821 women) showed a reduced risk, with an estimate of 0.96 (95% CI 0.86-1.08) per 25 g incr ease in ener gy-adjusted total fat. Menopausal status was not an effect modifier on these data.129 130 Eleven case-control studies showed increased risk with increasing fat intake,62 64 65 75 85 86 96-98 102 109 110 112which was statistically significant in thr ee.97 109 112Five studies showed decreased risk,63 64 79 101 116which was statistically significant in one.64Meta-analysis was possible on seven control stud- ies, giving a summary estimate of 1.11 (95% CI 1.06-1.16), with no heterogeneity.62 63 65 75 97 102 109 Thereis also evidence on percentage energy from fat. There arefour cohort studies131-134;three reported decr eased risk.131 133 134The reported non-significant increased were case-control both reported a non-significant decr eased risk.135 136 139CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS There is interest in the varying role that different types of individual fatty acids might have on breast cancer risk but there are insufficient data to draw any conclusions. There are mechanistic data connecting polyunsaturated fatty acids andperoxidation. Higher endogenous oestrogen levels after menopause are aknown cause of breast cancer. 137 138Dietary fat is relative- ly well established as a cause of increased endogenous oestrogen production.139Low-fat diets are usually associat- ed with high fibre consumption, which may reduce oestro- gen concentration by decreasing intestinal reabsorption. In premenopausal women, there is little evidence that serum oestrogen levels are associated either with fat consumption or with breast cancer risk. An alternative mechanism by which dietary fat could influ- ence steroid hormone levels is that increased serum-free fattyacids could displace oestradiol from serum albumin, thus increasing oestradiol concentration. 140However, serum concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin is amoreimportant determinant of the pr oportion of oestradiol that can enter the breast epithelial cells. Sex hormone-bind- ing globulin decr eases with incr easing body mass index and insulin resistance. Energy-dense diets (among other factors) lower the age of menarche. Early menarche is an established risk factor forbreast cancer. Evidence fr om prospective epidemiological studies of differ ent types shows inconsistent effects on the whole, while case-control studies show a significant positiveassociation. Mechanistic evidence is speculative.Overall, there is limited evidence suggesting thatconsumption of total fat is a cause of postmenopausalbreast cancer . 4.5.5.1.1 Butter Lung Two cohort studies8141and eight case-control studies142-149 investigated butter and lung cancer .(Also see chapter 7.4.) One cohort study showed statistically significant incr eased risk, with a summar yestimate of 1.8 (95% CI 1.0-3.0) for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest.8The other cohort study showed non-significant decreased risk 0.62-1.42) for non-smok ers. 141Both studies adjusted for smoking. Seven case-control studies showed increased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest,143-149 which was statistically significant in thr ee.143 145 149One study showed a non-significant decreased risk.142Most studies adjusted for smoking.142 143 145-149 Although no evidence for plausible mechanisms was found, based on the epidemiological evidence, there is limited evi- dence suggesting that butter is a cause of lung cancer . There is a limited amount of inconsistent evidence suggesting that consumption of butter is a cause oflung cancer .4.5.5.2 Foods containing animal fat The evidence here refers to animal fats as foods, for instance, lard, suet, or dripping, and not to estimated amounts con- tained within other foods (such as meat and milk and theirproducts, or baked goods). Colorectum Five cohort studies investigated animal fats and colorectal cancer.150-154(Also see chapter 7.9.) Three studies showed increased risk with increasing intake ofanimal fats,150 151 153which was statistically significant in one,150and statistically significant when comparing the sec- ond highest intake to the lowest intake group, but not when comparing the highest to lowest, in another study.151One study reported no effect on risk152and another showed non- significant increased risk in men and non-significantdecreased risk in women. 154Meta-analysis was possible on three studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.13 (95% CI 0.92-1.38) per 20 g/day, with moderate heterogeneity.150 152 154 Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-contr ol studies wer enot summarised. There is a limited amount of fairly consistent evidence suggesting that consumption of foods containinganimal fat is a cause of colorectal cancer. The P anel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study155has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). 4.5.6 Comparison with previous report The panel responsible for the previous report judged it pos- sible that diets relatively high in total fat, and/or in satu-rated/animal fat, were causes of cancers of the lung,colorectum, breast, endometrium, and prostate. That panelnoted a pattern wher eby diets relatively high in fat could increase the risk of some cancers, and pointed out that fats and oils ar eenergy-dense, and agreed that energy-dense diets increase the risk of obesity, itself a risk factor for some cancers. The pr evious report judged that diets high in dietary cho- lesterol were a possible cause of cancers of the lung and pan- creas. The overall evidence now does not support an association . Since the mid-1990s, the results of cohort studies have overall tended to weaken the evidence on fats and oils asdirect causes of cancer . 4.5.7 Conclusions The P anel concludes : Findings fr om cohort studies conducted since the mid-1990s have made the overall evidence associating fats and oils with the risk of any cancer somewhat less impressive. Thereis limited evidence suggesting that total fat is a 140PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS cause of lung cancer or postmenopausal breast cancer; that foods containing animal fat are a cause of colorectal cancer; and that butter is a cause of lung cancer. The Panel stresses that the main cause of lung cancer is smoking tobacco. Fats and oils are the most energy-dense constituents of foods. For discussion of the effect of energy-dense foods on weight gain, overweight, and obesity, and the role of weight gain, overweight, and obesity in the risk of some cancers, see Chapters 6, 7, and 8. 141CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS Sugars ar esweeteners and, in some forms, also a preservative and a bulking agent. Free sugars in the solidstate or as syrups are ingredients in many processed foodsand drinks. Nutritionally ,sugars supply ener gy and nothing else. Sugars added to food were a luxury untilsugar from cane became a major international cash crop,beginning in the 16th century. Consumption of addedsugars, from beet as well as cane, and syrups increasedrapidly in industrialised countries in the 19th and 20thcenturies. High-fructose corn syrups ar enow also used extensively .Overall consumption of sugars is incr easing worldwide, particularly in lower-income countries. In recent decades, and in many countries, consumption ofadded sugars, notably in the form of sugary drinks,accounts for a substantial proportion of energy intake. Salt (sodium chloride) is also a pr eservative. The sodium and chloride in salt ar eessential nutrients in small amounts. In nature, foods are generally low or very low in sodium. Like sugar, salt historically was scarce and a precious commodity ;the R omans paid their labour ers in salt, thus the word 'salary' (from 'sal' for salt). Consumption of salt, in the form of many processed, salted, and salty foods, or of salt added in cooking and attable, remains variable. Consumption of salt, and salty andsalt-pr eserved foods, is high in some maritime nations such as Japan, P ortugal, and other P ortuguese-speaking countries. In inland regions, such as landlocked African countries, consumption has been very low. Overall, the P anel judges that the evidence on salt is confined to stomach cancer ,and that on sugars is limited. The P anel judges as follows: Salt is a probable cause of stomach cancer. Salt-preservedfoods are also a probable cause of stomach cancer. Thereis limited evidence suggesting that sugars are a cause ofcolorectal cancer. Within the remit of this Report, thestrongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of 'convincing' and 'pr obable', shows that salt, and also salt- preserved foods, ar eprobably causes of stomach cancer. 'Extrinsic', mainly r efined, sugars amount to a substantial part of most industrialised food supplies. Sugars and syrups manufactur ed from cane, beet, and corn are profitable cash crops and ar eingredients in many pr ocessed foods and drinks. There is reason to believe that humans have evolved with abuilt-in desir efor sweet foods. It has also been pr oposed that humans have a specific appetite for salt that might have evolved because sodium is scarce in nature. In any case, assugars and salt become readily available and increasingly cheap, consumption tends to rise. In industrialised settings, sugars and salt ar emostly consumed, not in food prepara- tion or at the table, but as ingr edients of pr ocessed foods. Reports concerned with undernutrition have often, and still do, recommend substantial consumption of sugars andfats; their ener gy density enables quick weight gain ,and the SUGARS AND SALT, AND THE RISK OF CANCER In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer.

By contrast, reports concerned with prevention of chronic diseases fre- quently recommend restraint in consumption of sugars. One reason for this is that sugars are the dietary cause of dentalcaries. Sugars in the amounts typically consumed in many industrialised countries have also been identified as a cause ofobesity, and therefore also indirectly of obesity-related dis- ease. Reports concerned with nutritional deficiencies often recommend the iodisation of salt supplies, to prevent goitre.Reports concerned with the prevention of chronic diseases frequently highlight that salt intakes are usually greatly in excess of requirements, and recommend substantial decreas- es in salt consumption to prevent hypertension and cardio- vascular disease, especially stroke. For sugared drinks, see chapter 4.7. For the contribution of sugar to weight gain, overweight, and obesity in drinksor through energy density of foods, see Chapter 8. For salt- ed animal products, including Cantonese-style salted fish, see chapter 4.3. Non-caloric chemical sweeteners ar eincluded her e. 4.6.1 Definitions, sources 4.6.1.1 Sugars Sugars here means all sugars in the diet. These are mainly but not only 'extrinsic sugars', which include sucrose (com-monly called sugar), maltose, lactose, glucose, and fructose;in foods and drinks, including juices and milk, and in honeyand syrups, including high-fructose corn syrup; refined sug-ars added to food in pr ocessing, pr eparation (cooking), and at the table. 'Intrinsic' sugars are those naturally present in whole foods such as fruits. Sugars ar enow cheap and ar eused widely as sweeteners, preservatives, and bulking agents. They also often have the function of making processed starches, fats, and other ingre-dients more palatable. Also see box 4.6.1 Sucrose is refined from sugar beet and sugar cane. Maltose and glucose ar erefined predominantly from corn. High-fruc- tose corn syrup comprises a mixtur eof glucose with fructose, commonly in close to equal amounts, and is now used ingreat quantity in food and drink manufacture, particularly in the USA. The amount of sugars in manufactur ed foods and drinks varies. Sugared drinks are about 10 per cent by weight added sugars, and up to 100 per cent of their ener gy comes fr om sugars. Sugars ar eoften added to fruit juices. Jams and other preserves are about 60 per cent sugars. Cakes, biscuits (cook- ies), and other baked goods contain starches, fats, and sug-ars in var ying pr oportions. Most chocolate and much confectionery are high in sugars. It is often supposed that almost all added sugars are contained in obviously sweetfoods: this is not so. Breakfast cereals may contain anything from negligible amounts to 50 per cent sugars. Yoghurts may contain anything between 0 to 20 per cent sugars; and r eady- to-eat desserts even mor e. Many canned pr oducts include added sugars. Savoury processed foods, such as soups, pick- les, bread, and buns, often contain significant amounts of sugars .4.6.1.2 Salt The term 'salt', in common usage, refers to sodium chloride. It is now a cheap commodity. Like sugar, salt is a preserva-tive and a flavour enhancer .Both salt and sugar trap fr ee water from foods, thus preventing microbial proliferation and spoilage. Salt is found in some r ocks and dissolved in seawater, and can be extracted from seawater by evapora- tion. Both sodium and chloride are essential components ofthe diet in small amounts. Usually most salt in diets is contained in processed foods, with only a relatively small amount added in cooking or atthe table (bo x4.6.2). Some traditional diets include sub- stantial amounts of salt-pr eserved foods, including salted meat, fish, vegetables, and sometimes also fruits; and also salted foods such as bacon ,sausages, and ham, which con - tain from 3 to 5 g of salt per 100 g. Industrialised diets include many processed foods that are not salt-preserved but con-tribute substantial amounts of salt to the diet, even if theydo not seem salty, as well as more obviously salty foods suchas potato crisps (chips), salted nuts, and other salty snackfoods. Most of the sodium consumed in urban environmentscomes from salt added to processed foods, and thus is beyondthe contr ol of typical consumers. Many foods such as bread, soups, br eakfast cer eals, and biscuits may contain substantial amounts of salt; anything fr om 1 to 4 g per 100 g. 4.6.2 Composition 4.6.2.1 Sugars Sugars ar esimple carbohydrates, and pr ovide 3.75 kilo - calories per gram (see chapter 4.10.1). Sugars are single molecules such as glucose, fructose, and galactose (mono-saccharides), or two molecules bound together (disaccha - rides) such as sucrose (fructose and glucose), lactose (glucose and galactose), or maltose (two glucose molecules). The body metabolises different sugars at different rates; for instance, fructose is absorbed and metabolised more slowly than either glucose or sucr ose. It is also slightly sweet- er than glucose or sucr ose, and thus is able to r eplace them in lower total amounts. Non-caloric chemical sweeteners pro- duce a sweet taste, but are not sugars (box 4.6.3). Thereis no dietar yrequirement for sugars. The World As indicated in chapter 4.6.4, it is particularly difficult to mea- sure and assess the overall effect of sugars as possible modifiersof the risk of any disease, including cancer. This is partly because of inconsistency in the classification of sugars. Sometimes 'sugar' is equated with sucrose, which has been the chief sugar inhuman diets, but now is less so. Some studies investigate only'packet' sugar purchased for use in the home; this is in general arelatively small and diminishing proportion of total sugars con- sumed. Other studies include sugars as found naturally in fruitsand milk.Box 4.6.1 Sugar, sugars, sugary foods, and drinks 143CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS Health Organization recommends that average consumption of sugars by populations should be less than 10 per cent oftotal ener gy. 1 4.6.2.2 Salt Pure salt, as sodium chloride, contains no metabolisable energy. Formulated, granulated table salts often includeadditives, such as anti-caking agents, which pr event salt cr ys- tals from sticking together; potassium iodide, included to prevent iodine deficiency; traces of other sodium compounds(carbonate or thiosulphate); and also sugar, to stabilise thepotassium iodide. Sea salt may be refined to almost puresodium chloride, or unr efined, in which case they may include traces of other minerals, algae, and a few salt-toler - ant bacteria. Salt may also be flavour ed, for example with celery or garlic. Sodium is essential for the body to function normally. It is a major electr olyte in extracellular fluid. The body's sodi- um content and its concentration in body fluids are con- trolled homeostatically to ver yprecise limits; excess sodium is excreted in the urine. Sodium is also involved in r egula - tion of osmolarity, acid-base balance, and the membrane potential of cells. The daily requirement for sodium has beenestimated at ar ound 500 mg for adults. On a pragmatic basis, WHO recommends restricting average salt consumption for populations to less than 5 g per day. 1 4.6.3 Consumption patter ns 4.6.3.1 Sugars Sugars supply on average around 8 per cent of dietary ener- gy worldwide. This figur edisguises a wide range of intak esin different parts of the world. Diets in high-income coun- tries contain roughly twice the amount of sugars as those in lower-income countries. In North America and some European countries, average consumption is around 15-17per cent of dietar yenergy,with a fairly wide range ar ound this average. In the USA, in the last decades of the 20th cen- tury,many pr ocessed foods wer ereformulated to contain less fat but more sugars. In some parts of Asia, consumption is negligible, although globally sugar supplies are increasingrapidly. Children in high-income countries usually obtain ahigher proportion of their daily energy from sugar thanadults. 11 Consumption of sugars has generally incr eased over the last centur y,particularly in high-income countries, and also more recently in many countries undergoing economic tran- sition in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. 4.6.3.2 Salt The use of salt as a pr eservative has generally decr eased as industrial and domestic use of refrigeration has increased (box 4.6.4). But diets containing few salt-preserved foodsmay nevertheless be high in salt. The average adult daily intake of salt worldwide varies from less than 6 g to 18 g. Very high levels of intake are found in Japan ,some parts of China, K orea, Portugal, Brazil, and other P ortuguese-speaking countries, wher ediets con- tain substantial amounts of salt-preserved, salt-pickled, salt- ed, or salty foods. The average adult intake is around 9-12gper day in high-income countries, including Eur ope and North America. 4.6.4 Interpretation of the evidence 4.6.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2,3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' (RR) is used in this Report to denote ratio measur es of .Studies of sugars may be of total sugars; of As indicated in chapter 4.6.4.2, it is difficult to measure salt intake, or the contribution from separate sources (salty, salted, or salt-preserved foods). The most reliable estimates come from measuring the amount of sodium excreted in the urine. Salt is itself readily identified, although it is sometimes com- bined in studies with other sodium compounds. Some studies investigate only salt added in cooking or at the table, but thisis usually a small proportion of total salt consumption. Results from such studies are liable to produce different results, com- pared with those from studies that have examined total salt con-sumption. It has been thought that any effect of salt on stomach can- cer (see chapter 4.6.5.2) is principally the result of regularconsumption of salted and salt-preserved foods, rather than salt as such. This is partly because such foods are a substantial part of traditional Japanese and other Asian diets, where incidenceofstomach cancer has been and still is high. However, the inci- dence of this cancer is also high in countries where traditional diets contain substantial amounts of salty as distinct from salt- preserved foods; and the concentration of salt in manyprocessed foods consumed in Eur ope and North America approaches that of salt-preserved foods.Box 4.6.2 Salt, and salty, salted, and salt-preserved foods Chemical sweeteners such as saccharin, cyclamates, and aspar- tame have been thought to be possible causes of cancer. This is because some animal studies have shown that very high doses of saccharin, in particular, increase the incidence of bladder can-cer in rats. In common with many chemical additives, some sweet- eners can be shown to be carcinogenic in experimental settings in massive amounts, far greater than humans could consume infoods and drinks. The evidence from epidemiological studies does not suggest that chemical sweeteners have a detectable effect on the risk ofany cancer. Box 4.6.3 Chemical sweeteners144PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS sugars added at the table; of sugar yfoods and/or drinks; of sucrose; or of added sugars generally; and may or may not include those sugars naturally pr esent in foods. Studies using such varying classifications are difficult to compare. Similarly, studies of salt may be of salt added in cookingand/or at the table; of salty or salted foods; or of salt con - sumption as a whole. These studies are also difficult to com- pare. See box 4.6.1 and box 4.6.2. Measurement . Measurement of salt intake is notoriously dif- ficult, and is best done by measuring the ex cretion of sodi- um in urine over a 24-hour period. But this method has onlyrarely been used. Study design . See Classification. Also studies may under- estimate the amounts of sugars and of salt in foods and drinks consumed outside the home. Repor ting bias .Added sugars ar egenerally r egarded as unhealthy, and studies that depend on self-reporting may dis- proportionately underestimate the consumption of sugars. 4.6.5 Evidence and judgements The full systematic literature review (SLR) is contained on the CD included with this R eport. Therelationship between the intak eof sugars and the risk of cancer is often adjusted for total energy intake, meaning that sugars are assessed as a proportion of total dietary ener-gy. 12Wher ethis is the case, this has been stated.4.6.5.1 Sugars Colorectum One cohort study13and 7 case-contr ol studies14-20investi - gated sugars as foods and colorectal cancer. Seven cohort studies21-27and 16 case-control studies investigated sugars as nutrients, defined as sucr ose or fructose. Sugars as foods The single cohort study stated that there was no association between usually adding sugar to cereals and colorectalcancer . 13 All seven case-contr ol studies showed incr eased risk with increased sugar intak e,14-20which was statistically significant in two.17 18The classification of 'sugars as foods' varied con- siderably between studies. Sugars as nutrients Four cohort studies r eported on total sugar intake.21 22 25 26One study r eported a non-significant incr eased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest, with an effect esti- mate of 1.03 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-1.44).22One study r eported a non-significant lower sugar intak ein cases than controls.21Two cohort studies stated that there was no association between sugar intake and risk.25 26 Three cohort studies reported on sucrose intake.23 24 27Two cohort studies showed non-significant increased risk when comparing the highest intak egroup against the lowest.23 27 Effect estimates wer CI 0.88-2.39)23and 1.30 (95% CI 0.99-1.69) in men.27One a non- statistically significant decreased risk (0.89 (95% CI0.72-1.11) in women). 27 Freezing and cooling by use of natural ice and snow is a method of food preservation traditionally available only in cold climatesor in winter in temperate climates. Natural ice refrigeration on an industrial scale first developed in the late 19th century, whenrefrigerated containers used in trains, ships, and then later trucks, greatly increased the production and consumptionof red meat. Domestic freezing, chilling, and refrigeration on a mass scale is a phe- nomenon mostly of the second half of the20th century. Today, much perishable food is sold frozen or chilled. Together with thegrowth of industrial refrigeration, domes- tic refrigerators began to be used in the USA, Australia, and New Zealand on any scale in the 1920s, and in Europe and Japan mostly since the 1950s. In Japan, for exam- ple, households possessing r efrigerators increased from 9 per cent in 1960 to 91 per cent in 1970, and 99 per cent in 2004.Supermarkets with freezers, chill cabinets, and domestic refrigerators are now com-monplace in the cities and towns of tropi- cal countries; poorer rural communities still rely on drying, fermenting, salting, bot-tling, tinning, and other methods of food preservation, as well as their own gardens and farms. It is unlikely that refrigerationitself has any direct effect on the risk of cancer. Its effects are indirect. Refrigeration: Enables consumption of fresh perishable foods including seasonal vegetables andfruits all year round, as well as of fresh meat. Reduces microbial and fungalcontamination of perishable foods, notably cereals (grains) and pulses (legumes). Reduces the need for and use of salting, smoking, curing, and pickling as methods of pr eserving vegetables, fruits, and meat. It can therefore be said that refrigeration (including freezing and chilling) indirectlyinfluences risk of those cancers, the risk of which is affected by the above factors. Evidence amounting to a judgement of 'convincing' or 'probable' for such factors is summarised in earlier sections of thischapter, and in Chapter 7, and relates to cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, nasopharynx, oesophagus, lung, stomach,pancreas, liver, and colorectum. In particular, many studies have noted a reciprocal relationship between use ofrefrigeration and consumption of salt and foods preserved with salt. Meta-analysis of eight case-control studies 2-9has shown a significant association between the use of refrigeration (usually as gauged by poss- ession of a domestic refrigerator) and reduced risk of stomach cancer. The one cohort study10identified mea- sured ef fects in the Netherlands over a 25-year period, in which almost the entire population had access to commercial anddomestic refrigeration, and did not find any association. Box 4.6.4 Refrigeration145CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS Three cohort studies reported separate results for fruc- tose2324 27;one reported a significant increased risk in men of 1.37 (95% CI 1.05-1.78).27Two other studies reported non-significant decreased risk.23 27 Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. Inmost, though not all, animal experiments, sucrose and fructose are associated with increased colonic proliferation and aberrant crypt foci. These sugars may interfere with levels ofblood glucose and/or triglycerides, either directly or through hormones like insulin and others (also see Chapter 2). 28 The evidence is hard to interpret. There is limited evidence suggesting that sugar is a cause of colorectalcancer. 4.6.5.2 Salt Stomach Three cohort studies,10 29 3021 case-control studies,2431-48 and 12 ecological studies49-60investigated total salt use and stomach cancer. Two cohort studies10 61and 13 case-control studies4939 43 62-71investigated salt 1 cohort study72and 8 case-control studies439 73-78investigat- ed sodium intake. Total salt use Two cohort studies showed increased risk with increased salt intak e,10 30which was statistically significant in one study in men but not women .30One study showed statistically sig - nificant decreased risk.29Meta-analysis was possible on two cohort studies, giving a summar yeffect estimate of 1.08 (95% CI 1.00-1.17) per 1 g/day, with moderate hetero- geneity (figure 4.6.1). The study that could not be includedwas inconsistent with this summary, with an effect estimate of 0.53 (95% CI 0.31-0.91) for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest; however, this study did not adjust for other factors.29The two cohort studies that report- ed increased risk used much more detailed questionnaires to assess salt intake (150 compared to 27 items). They also adjusted for a greater number of confounders than the study that reported decreased risk. Twelve of the case-control studies showed increased risk with increased salt intake,232 34 35 39 40 42-46which was statis- tically significant in six.32 40 42-45None of the studies showed statistically significant decreased risk. Most other studies reported either risk estimates close to 1.0 or reported that there was no statistical association. Meta-analysis was pos-sible on eight case-control studies, giving a summary effectestimate of 1.01 (95% CI 0.99-1.04) per 1 g/day, with highheterogeneity (figure 4.6.1). Adose-response relationship was apparent from cohort but not case-control data. Seven ecological studies r eported incr eased risk with increased salt intake, 49 52-55 57 58which was statistically sig- nificant in four .5354 57 58The r emaining five studies r eported either a decreased risk with increased salt intake50 56 59 60or no association,51none of which was statistically significant. Stomach cancer rates are highest in those areas of the world,such as parts of Asia and Latin America, where diets are tra-ditionally salty due to the regular consumption of meat, fish,vegetables, and other foods pr eserved by salting, as well as of salty foods. Salt added at the table Both cohort studies reported that there was no significant effect, and estimates were close to one (1.0) (95% CI0.6-1.6) 61and 0.9 (95% CI 0.56-1.44).10 Twelve case-control studies showed increased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest,4939 43 62- 64 66-71which was statistically significant in eight.4943 62-64 67 One other study reported similar intakes in cases and contr ol.65 Sodium The single cohort study showed a non-significant decreased risk.72 Six case-contr ol studies showed increased risk for the high- est intake group when compared to the lowest,39 73-77which was statistically significant in thr ee.39 74 77Two studies showed decr eased risk, which was statistically significant in both.478Meta-analysis was possible on five studies, giving asummary effect estimate of 1.18 (95% CI 1.02-1.38) per 1g/day ,with high heter ogeneity 78 Interaction with Helicobacter pylori infection Two case-control studies that investigated total salt use also investigated the potential for interaction with Hpylori infec- tion (also see bo x7.5.1).79 80One study was suggestive of a multiplicative effect on risk for high salt use and Hpylori pos- itive status79;the other stated that there was no association.80 Salt intake may be inversely related to the availability of refrigeration both within and between populations.

There is evidence from laboratory experiments that high salt intake damages the lining of the stomach.81It has also been shown to increase endogenous N-nitroso compound formation.82In addition, a high salt diet has been shown to have a synergistic interaction with gastric carcinogens.82It may only contribute to gastric cancer in subjects who have Hpylori infections and are also exposed to a chemical carcinogen. There is a substantial amount of evidence from studies on total salt use, salt added at the table, and sodiumintake. For total salt use, a dose-response relationshipwas apparent from cohort but not case-control studies.For sodium intake, a dose-response was also apparentfrom case-control studies. The mechanistic evidence is strong. Salt is a probable cause of stomach cancer. The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR ,one cohort83and two case-control studies84 85have been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement (see box 3.8). 4.6.5.2.1 Salted and salty foods Stomach Four cohort studies86-89,17 case-control studies46-8 33 41 45 90- 99and 1 ecological study100investigated salted or salty foods and stomach cancer .

Adose-response relationship is apparent from case-control, but not cohort data (figure 4.6.3). Heterogeneity may be partly explained by variation between studies in the precise foods being assessed. The single ecological study showed non-significant decreased risk in areas of increased salt consumption. 100 The mechanisms through which salt could plausibly cause stomach cancer are given above. The evidence fr om both case-contr ol and cohort studies is consistent. A dose-response relationship is appar ent fr om case-contr ol but not cohort studies. There is robust evidence for mechanisms operating in humans. Salted and salty foods are a probable cause ofstomach cancer.

Theprevious report judged that salt and also salting are probable causes of stomach cancer. This judgement is also much the same as that in this Report. 4.6.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : Salt is a probable cause of stomach cancer. Salted and salty foods are also a probable cause of stomach cancer. There islimited evidence suggesting that sugars ar eacause of col - orectal cancer. 148PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Water is essential. Without water, people die in a matter of days. As well as adequate supplies of water, a major publichealth issue throughout the world is the safety of domesticand other water. Water quality may be compromised bychemical or micr obiological contamination. Fruit juices made fr omfruits or fruit pulps are often concentrated for storage and transport, then diluted with water to produce the final product. Sugar and otheringredients are frequently added in this finalreconstitution process. Soft drinks are usually made from water, sugar, colourings, flavourings, and mixtures of herbs and other ingr edients, to give a distinctive taste and character .Consumption of branded, carbonated soft drinks, and cola drinks in particular, has increased greatly in the 20th century, and continues to increase throughout the world. The rise is most mark ed in lower income groups. Tea and coffee are now the main hot drinks consumed worldwide. Both contain stimulants and other bioactiveconstituents, and many people add milk and sugar. A greatvariety of herbal infusions ar ealso drunk, including mat\u00e9, the traditional hot drink in parts of South America. Overall, the Panel judges that the direct evidence relating non-alcoholic drinks to cancer is contamination of watersupplies with inor ganic arsenic and irritation of the oralcavity by mat\u00e9, and possibly by other very high- temperature drinks. For evidence relating sugared softdrinks to body fatness, see Chapter 8. The P anel judges as follows: The evidence that inor ganic arsenic in drinking water is a cause of lung cancer is convincing. W ater contaminated in this way is probably a cause of skin cancer. Arsenic and arsenic compounds are recognised carcinogens. There islimited evidence suggesting that water contaminated inthis way is a cause of cancers of the kidney and bladder. Mat\u00e9, a herbal infusion, as drunk traditionally in parts of Latin America, is pr obably a cause of oesophageal cancer. Damage caused by the very high temperature of the drink, rather than by the herb itself, is judged to be responsible. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting that mat\u00e9 is a cause of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx, for the same reason. There is also limited evidence suggesting that high-temperature drinks are a cause ofoesophageal cancer. It is unlik ely that coffee has any substantial effect on the risk of cancer either of the pancr eas or of the kidney . Within the remit of this Report, the strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of 'convincing' or 'probable',shows that inor ganic arsenic in drinking water is a cause WATER, FRUIT JUICES, SOFT DRINKS, HOT DRINKS, AND THE RISK OF CANCER In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence.

Mat\u00e9 is probably a cause of oesophageal cancer. It is unlikely thatcoffee has any substantial effect on the risk of eithercancer of the pancreas or of the kidney. Chapter 4.7 concerns all non-alcoholic drinks. Water, including that contained in drinks and foods, is an invariable part of all diets. Bottled spring and mineral watersare consumed by people who can afford them. Juices made from fruits and water, often sweetened (at first with honey and then sugar), have been drunk throughout history. Cordials, squashes, and other drinks made mainly from colourings and flavourings, with some fruit juices, herbs, orother ingredients added, started to become popular from thebeginning of the 19th century. Carbonated sweet drinks(sometimes known as sodas) such as cola were first mass- manufactured in the USA and are now commonly consumed throughout the world. Tea was cultivated and drunk in China for over a thousand years. Then, from the 18th century, it became commonly drunk in Britain ,and was cultivated in India and other coun - tries, and drunk in other parts of the world. The original teas were green and drunk without adding milk or sugar.Manufacture of black teas came later; from the 19th centu-ry, teas became the main hot stimulant drink in Britain,almost always drunk with milk and often with sugar added.Coffee was cultivated in and exported to many parts of theworld fr om the 19th centur y; it remains the main cash crop in a number of tropical countries such as Ethiopia and Brazil. Coffee is the main hot stimulant drink in the Americas, many European countries, and also in the Arab world. In some parts of the world, coffee is usually drunk black, with orwithout sugar ;in other countries, milk or cr eam is often added. Chocolate is also consumed as a beverage. Reports concerned with infectious diseases, especially of childhood, usually emphasise the importance of safe watersupplies. Reports concerned with the prevention of chronicdiseases sometimes specify sugar ed soft drinks as contribu- tors to over weight and obesity .They occasionally recom- mend substantial consumption of water as healthy in itselfand preferable to soft or alcoholic drinks. Contaminants of water, and also of foods and other drinks, aregrouped here with water. High-temperature foods are grouped here with high-temperature drinks. For the r elationship between sugared drinks and body fat- ness, see Chapter 8. 4.7.1 Definitions, sour ces 4.7.1.1 Water Water comes from rain, underground aquifers accessed by wells, springs, and freshwater lakes and rivers. People cannot live without water, which is vital for the nor- mal functioning of the body .Even mild dehydration (water loss of 1-2 per cent of the body weight) can produce symp- toms such as dry mouth and headaches. Stopping all fluidintak emay cause death in days, the number depending onthe health of the individual and external conditions such as temperature and humidity. Water can be used as a vehicle to provide fluoride and can contribute to intakes of essential elements, calcium, iron,and copper, depending on its origin and the piping materi- als used. The water content of the body is around 70 per cent: men's bodies contain a higher proportion of water than those of women because women have more body fat, which has min-imal amounts of water. Adults produce an average of around 1.5 litres of urine each day and lose an additional litre of water through breathing, from the skin by evaporation or sweating, and in the faeces. Approximately 80 per cent of water intake comes from drinks; food provides the other 20per cent. Tap water quality is regulated in most countries based on World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water that includes tap water and bottled water. 1 Around the world, ground, rain, and river waters are also drunk, often without first being tr eated to secur esafety .More than 1 billion people (around 15 per cent of the world's pop- ulation) lack access to safe, clean water2and ar eat risk of exposure to water-borne contaminants and infectious dis- eases. Arsenic, the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, and para- sitic schistosomes are among the many contaminants thatmay be found in water supplies. In many low-income coun-tries, access to clean water is limited for the low-incomesegments of the populations and those living in rural ar eas. 4.7.1.2 Fruit juices Fruit juices include liquids extracted fr om whole or pulped fruits. Commercially prepared fruit juices may be pasteurised to extend shelf-life, and concentrated at source to be recon-stituted befor epackaging, closer to the point of sale. 4.7.1.3 Soft drinks The term 'soft drinks' is used for a wide range of coloured and flavoured non-alcoholic drinks, usually sold in cans, car-tons, or bottles. They may be carbonated (such as cola drinksor lemonade) or still (such as fruit squashes). Some softdrinks ar emilk-based (milkshak es and yoghurt drinks). Depending on the ingredients, some soft drinks may be mar- keted with health claims, and are sometimes known as 'func-tional drinks' (also see bo x4.10.2). 4.7.1.4 Hot drinks The most common hot drinks curr ently consumed ar etea and coffee. These are infusions (brewed using boiling water) usually drunk hot, sometimes very hot (box 4.7.1). Coffeeis made fr om gr ound, r oasted coffee beans \u2014 the dried seeds of coffee plant berries. The beans naturally contain caffeine. Decaffeinated coffees are produced by various processes,using water, organic solvents, steam, or by interfering with the expression of the gene coding for caffeine. Instant cof- fee comprises the soluble solids derived fr om dried, double- brewed coffee. Coffee is a lar ge bush native to Ethiopia, cultivated in many hot and humid climates. The main cof- fee-exporting countries are Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia. Although many herbal infusions ar eknown as teas, tea is 150PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS specifically the infusion of the dried leaves of the plant Camellia sinensis .Green tea is made from leaves that have first been cooked, pressed, and dried. To produce black tea, the fresh leaves are withered, rolled repeatedly, allowed toturn deep brown, and then air-dried until they are dark in colour. Tea leaves contain caffeine and theophylline. Decaffeinated teas are produced using similar processes to those used for coffee. Most tea is grown in Asia. Mat\u00e9 is a type of herbal tea prepared from the dried leaves of the plant Ilex paraguariensis that has stimulant properties similar to the other methylxanthine-containing drinks (cof- fee and tea). Herbal and other teas are also consumed cold. Iced teas are popular in the USA and some other countries: these aresugared and considered here as soft drinks. 4.7.2 Composition 4.7.2.1 W ater Water is a molecule comprising hydrogen and oxygen: chem- ically ,H2O.Rainwater may contain traces of air pollutants; water from underground aquifers may contain traces of min- erals from surrounding rocks and other surfaces. Groundwater may also be contaminated with natural minerals aswell as with various industrial and agricultural chemicals,some of which are carcinogenic in laboratory conditions (box4.7.2). Mineral water fr om springs and other sources con-tains higher trace amounts of various minerals and other substances, often detectable to taste. Some spring water is naturally carbonated. Bottled water is either still or car- bonated, sometimes artificially. The safety of water in termsof chemical and microbial contamination is well regulated by the WHO programme on chemical safety, but unfortu- nately, monitoring and surveillance in most countries are limited. Arsenic residues can arise from agricultural, mining, and industrial practices, or may occur naturally from volcanic activity. WHO guidelines recommend that levels of arsenic in drinking water should not exceed 10 \u00b5g/l. 4Levels of arsenic in affected areas may range from tens to hundreds, or even thousands, of micrograms per litre. In unaffectedareas, levels are typically less than 10 \u00b5g/l. Inorganic arsenic(arsenate or arsenite) is the form that predominantly cont-aminates drinking water. Arsenic is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Drinking watercontaminated with arsenic is also classed separately as a human carcinogen. 5 The bacterium Hpylori is found in water supplies conta - minated with faeces. It is an established necessary cause of distal stomach cancer (see box 7.5.1). Chronic schistosomiasis (infestation with schistosomes) is aknown cause of bladder and liver cancer (see chapters 7.16 and 7.8).6It is caused by contact with water contam- inated by parasite eggs. Constant mechanical irritation of epithelial surfaces causes inflammation, which predisposes to the development of cancer(see Chapter 2). It has also been suggested that foods and drinks with chemically irritant components may be a cause of cancers of those sites with which they come into direct contact. Again,thereis not much evidence for this theory, with the possible exception of chilli and stomach cancer (see chapter 4.2). Ther eis, however, some evidence that some thermally hot (and therefore irritant) drinks are a cause of cancers of thosesites with which they come into direct contact. As shown in this section, mat\u00e9, the herbal infusion, is pr obably a cause of cancer of the oesophagus, and there is limited evidence suggesting that it is also a cause of other cancers of the oral cavity. This is prob-ably not because of any carcinogen in the herb itself, but because of the way the infusion is traditionally drunk in thepampas region within the southern cone of Latin America, in northernArgentina, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. It is drunk extremely hot from a gourd through a metal straw, which is often kept rested in the mouth, rather like the stem of a tobac- co pipe. 3Ther eis no substantive evidence that mat\u00e9 pr epar ed in the style of tea, loose or in sachets (bags), af fects the risk of cancer. There is also limited evidence suggesting that various other very hot drinks and foods are a cause of cancer of the oesoph-agus when they are consumed regularly. The implications of this evidence, while so far not str ong, suggest that mor eresearch may be warranted (see chapter 4.7.5.6). Box 4.7.1 High-temperature, and irritant drinks and foods Water contaminants that are causes of cancer are inorganic arsenic (reviewed here) and Helicobacter pylori and schistosomes (see Chapter 7). Many other contaminants of water ar eidentified as or have been thought to be carcinogenic, usually as a result of animal and other experiments, or else as a result of industrial accidentsor gr oss overuse. These include herbicides and pesticides, fer- tilisers that contain and r elease nitrates, and disinfectants that also produce potentially toxic contaminants such as chlorinat- ed and brominated organic compounds. They also include chem- icals deliberately added to drinking water as public health measures, notably chlorine and fluoride. These and other industrial, agricultural, and other chemicals are the subject of tests and regulations for toxicity and safetyin use. Nevertheless, they are often popularly believed to be sig- nificant causes of cancer .This subject is contr oversial and is like- ly to remain so. Currently ther eis no substantial epidemiological evidence that any of these substances, singly or in combination, as cur- rently regulated and usually consumed in water, or in foods and other drinks, has any significant ef fect on the risk of any can- cer. The Panel considers that the evidence is insufficient to con- clude that usual intakes of industrial, agricultural, and other chemicals have an ef fect on the risk of human cancer .Toxicity and car cinogenicity of pollutants as a result of industrial acci- dents or overuse are outside the scope of this Report.Box 4.7.2 Contamination of water, and of foods and other drinks151CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS 4.7.2.2 Fruit juices Bottled or canned or otherwise packaged fruit juices are made from the fruits they contain or from fruit pulp. As well as added water, they usually also contain some added sug-ars, preservatives, and other additives. They often contain trivial amounts of dietary fibre. Fruit and vegetable juices have different nutritional properties from whole fruits and vegetables. For these reasons, the international 'at least five aday' campaign to encourage people to eat more fruits and vegetables (at least five portions per day) recommends that juices only count as one portion per day, irrespective of the amount consumed. 4.7.2.3 Soft drinks Soft drinks are made from water, colourings, flavourings, and herbal or other ingredients. They may or may not containfruit juice. They also contain either sugars or, in 'diet' form, chemical sweeteners (see chapter 4.6 and box 4.6.3). They may or may not be carbonated. The original formulations ofcola drinks contained stimulants fr om the coca and cola plants. Soft drinks may also include yoghurt and other milk derivatives, as yoghurt drinks or fruit 'smoothies', and also added vitamins and minerals. 'Sports' drinks contain sugars, electrolytes, and other additives. 4.7.2.4 Hot drinks The main hot drinks are tea (usually black tea but also green tea, which is often pr eferred in China) and coffee. Both con- tain various antio xidants and phenolic compounds, some of which have been shown to have anti-cancer properties in lab- orator yconditions.7They both also contain caffeine (and the related compound theophylline in tea). There is more caffeine in tea leaves than in coffee beans, but brewed coffee containsmorecaffeine than br ewed tea. Caffeine and theophylline ar e bioactive, quickening reaction times, relieving fatigue, and stimulating the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Tea and coffee, when drunk without adding milk, cream, sugar, lemon, or honey, contain no energy and trivialamounts of some micr onutrients; the bioactive chemicals they contain ar ementioned above. When these drinks ar e consumed fr equently ,both may be substantial dietary sources of some of these bioactive constituents. Thus, coffee is a major source of some antioxidants in the US diet. 8 4.7.3 Consumption patter ns 4.7.3.1 Water Environmental conditions, health, activity levels, and other factors determine the amount of water needed, but ther eis no international recommendation for daily consumption. The Institute of Medicine in the USA recommends 2.7 litresper day total water for women and 3.7 litres for men. The UK's Food Standards Agency estimates that most people need to drink at least 1.2 litr es of fluids per day. More than half of the world's population has access to drinkingwater through taps in their homes or outside. Tap water should be regulated to meet international qualityguidelines, such as those pr epared by WHO . 9Most people who do not have access to clean drinking water live in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and some parts of Latin America. High concentrations of arsenic in drinking water have been found in areas of Bangladesh, China, andWest Bengal (India), and also in more localised areas of Argentina, Australia, Chile, Mexico, Taiwan, China, the USA, and Vietnam. In many of these regions, the drinking water source is groundwater naturally contaminated by arsenic- rich geological formations. 10 4.7.3.2 Fruit juices There is little information on the general or local consump- tion of fruit juices. 4.7.3.3 Soft drinks In 2004, global consumption of soft drinks was estimated at 480 000 million litres (including bottled water),11of which cola and other carbonated drinks accounted for 40 per cent. In terms of sales, carbonated drinks are the largest single cat-egory.World sales of cola drinks continue to rise, as do mor e recently, sales of bottled waters, fruit juices, and 'function- al drinks'. The US Ais the biggest per capita consumer of soft drinks, followed by Mexico and Chile. The USA alone accounts for more than a 20 per cent share of the globaltotal. Asia is the fastest growing market for soft drinks: salesare increasing at around 3.5 per cent each year. Average consumption of soft drinks in the USA is around a12-ounce can (about 350 ml) per person/day .Older chil- dren consume about this amount, and sometimes mor e. Most of these drinks are sugared. At this level, soft drinks con- tribute a substantial pr oportion of total sugars intak e. 4.7.3.4 Hot drinks After water ,tea and coffee ar ethe most commonly con - sumed drinks in the world. There are various different meth- ods of preparing these hot drinks depending on culture andpersonal preference. Coffee consumption is high in northernEurope and North America. Low-income countries exportmost of the world's coffee; high-income countries consumeapproximately seven times as much (per capita) as low- income countries. Average worldwide consumption of tea is around 0.5 kg per person/year; this is exceeded significantly in severalAsian countries (notably ,China, India, and Japan), and in the UK and Ireland. Worldwide, black tea is the most popu- lar type, although gr een tea is mor ecommonly drunk in Asia. Mat\u00e9, as traditionally pr epared, is drunk almost ex clusively in parts of South America. 4.7.4 Interpretation of the evidence 4.7.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and bo xes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' (RR) is used in this Report to denote ratio measures of effect, AND JUDGEMENTS 4.7.4.2 Specific Classification .Different types of tea, coffee, and soft drinks are consumed in different cultures. The ways in which tea and coffee are prepared and drunk also vary. For coffee, thisincludes the degree of roasting, the methods of brewing (which determine the strength and composition), and the different substances added. Similarly, tea may be consumed with or without milk and in different strengths. Associations seen in one population but not another may reflect someaspect of the drink as consumed in that population rather than the drinks themselves. In some studies, fruit juices and bottled waters are included in the definition of soft drinks. Measurement .Fluid intake is best estimated from urine collection, but this is rarely done. Instead, estimates areusually made from food frequency questionnaires. Confounding .In interpreting the results of epidemiological studies of all types of drink, confounding by other habitsshould be consider ed. For example, heavy consumers of soft drinks, tea, or coffee may also be smokers and drinkers of alcohol. People who are physically active often consume more liq- uid than those who are not. Physical activity is therefore a con-founder of the relationship between the volume of fluid drunkand cancer risk, but may not be adequately adjusted for. Repor ting bias .Soft and cola drinks ar eoften identified as unhealthy ,and studies that depend on self -reporting may disproportionately underestimate consumption. 4.7.5 Evidence and judgements The full systematic literature review (SLR) is contained on the CD included with this Report. 4.7.5.1 Water The evidence was too sparse or inconsistent to draw any con - clusion about the r elationship between water quantity and cancer risk. 4.7.5.1.1 Water-borne contaminants: arsenic Ecological studies based on known arsenic concentrations in water may be interpreted more robustly than for many other dietar yexposur es. Lung Two cohort studies,12-172case-control studies18 19and 12 ecological studies20-30investigated arsenic in drinking water and lung cancer. Both cohort studies showed statistically significant increased risk of lung cancer for the highest intake group compared to the lowest.12-17Although meta-analysis was not possible, both studies r eported that a dose-response rela- tionship was appar ent. One study (in T aiwan) based in a population with endemic black foot disease, a manifestation of arsenicosis, reported an effect estimate of 3.29 (95% con-fidence inter val (CI) 1.60-6.78) for average arsenic level inwell water. 13The other study reported a quantified effect estimate, which was 3.66 (95% CI 1.81-7.03), but this study (based in Japan) did not adjust for smoking.17 Both case-control studies showed increased risk of lung cancer for the highest intake group compared to the lowest,18 19which was statistically significant in one.19The other study did not report confidence intervals. Effect estimates were 3.0118and 8.9 (95% CI 4.0-19.6).19 Ecological studies were made in populations from Argentina,27Belgium,21Chile,29China,23Switzerland,20and Taiwan,22-26 30aswell as worldwide.28Eight studies showed increased risk of lung cancer with increasing levels of arsenic in drinking water,21-25 27 29 30which was statistically signifi- cant in four.24 27 29 30Two studies showed decreased risk,20 26 which was statistically significant in one.26One study report- ed different inconsistent results for men and women (corre-lation coefficients of -0.51 for men and 0.07 for women). 28 One study showed that measures to lower arsenic levels in drinking water by using tap water rather than well waterwereassociated with a fall in lung cancer rates in a r egion of Taiwan with endemic black foot disease. 25 The general mechanisms thr ough which arsenic could plausibly cause cancer are outlined below. In addition, sol- uble arsenic in drinking water induces lung cancers in ani-mal models and causes chronic lung disease. 5 The evidence is ample and consistent, both from cohort and case-contr ol as well as ecological studies. Thereis a dose-r esponse relationship and the effect size is relatively large. There is robust evidence for mechanisms. The evidence that arsenic is a cause oflung cancer is convincing. Skin Two cohort studies,31 325case-control studies,33-371cross- sectional study,38and 11 ecological studies20 22 24 27 29 30 39-43 investigated arsenic in drinking water and skin cancer. Both cohort studies showed non-significant increased risk with incr easing levels of arsenic in the water31 32;however , for one study the incr eased risk was appar ent in women but not in men .32Effect estimates wer e1.82 (95% CI 0.5-4.66) for women and men Utah,32 1.00-1.47) per 100 \u00b5g/l.31 arsenic levels in toe- and fingernails.36 37Such measures are less subject to error and bias than some other methods to assess actual exposur e to a car cinogen .One study r eported a significant incr eased risk for melanoma with a risk estimate of 1.65 (95% CI 1.27-2.14) per 100 ng/g36;the other study reported non-sig- nificant incr eased risk 1.02 (95% CI 0.90-1.17) per 100 ng/g for basal cell carcinoma and 1.12 (95% CI 0.95-1.32) for squamous cell carcinoma.37 Two case-control studies that reported on dietary arsenic showed increased risk with increased intake,33 35which was statistically significant in one.33One study r eported a non- significant decr eased risk.34 The cross-sectional study showed a statistically significant increased risk, with a partially adjusted effect estimate of5.04 (95% CI 1.07-23.8) for > 0.71 versus 0 parts per mil - 153CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS lion average arsenic content in water.38 All 11 ecological studies reported increased risk for skin cancer with increased arsenic exposure,2022 24 27 29 30 39-43 which was statistically significant in 4,24 29 30 40 41and statis- tically significant in women but not in men in 127;and sig- nificant in men but not women in another study.20The effect increased with age (cumulative exposure), where that was measured, and the reported effect estimates were usually large, more than half being greater than 2.5. The general mechanisms through which arsenic could plausibly cause cancer are outlined below. The evidence is consistent, from cohort, case-control and ecological studies. There is robust mechanisticevidence. Arsenic is a probable cause of skin cancer. Kidney Three cohort studies,32 44 45one time-series study,46and nine ecological studies20 22 24 27 29 30 40 47 48investigated arsenic in drinking water and kidney cancer . All three cohort studies showed increased risk for the high- est intak elevels compar ed to the lowest,3244 45which was statistically significant in one.45Effect estimates were 1.49 (95% CI 0.67-3.31; adjusted for smoking),442.82 (95% CI 1.29-5.36),45and 1.13 (women; confidence intervals not reported) and 1.43 (men; confidence intervals not report-ed). 32 The single time-series study r eported a statistically signif- icant decr eased risk in kidney cancer following the installa - tion of a tap water supply system in an arsenic-endemic area of Taiwan .46 All nine ecological studies showed increased risk with higher levels of arsenic in drinking water,20 22 24 27 29 30 40 47 48 which was statistically significant in six.24 27 30 40 48 The general mechanisms through which arsenic could plausibly cause cancer are outlined below. In addition,arsenic in drinking water is well absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract, and both inorganic arsenic and its methyl-ated metabolites eexcreted can modify the urinar yexcretion of porphyrins in animals and humans.50 The evidence is sparse. There is limited evidence suggesting that arsenic is a cause of kidney cancer. Bladder Six cohort studies,14 17 32 44 45 511time-series study ,527case- contr ol studies,18 53-60and 11 ecological studies20 22 24 29 30 40 47 48 61-64investigated arsenic in drinking water and bladder cancer. Four cohort studies showed incr eased risk for the highest intake levels compared to the lowest,14 17 44 45which was sta- tistically significant in two.17 45One study showed non-sig- nificant decreased risk.32The single cohort study that measured arsenic levels in finger- or toenails reported an effect estimate of 1.05 (95% CI 0.85-1.29) per 100 ng/g.51 Three case-contr ol studies showed incr eased risk for the highest intake levels compared to the lowest,1856-59which was statistically significant in one.18Two studies showed non-significant decr eased risk,53 55two studies showed on risk,5460including single case-control study that measured arsenic levels in finger- or toenails.60 Six ecological studies showed increased risk with higher levels of arsenic in drinking water; all were statisticallysignificant. 22 24 29 30 40 62 64Two studies reported decreased risk,47 61which was statistically significant in one.47One study showed a non-significant decreased risk in men and a non-significant increased risk in women.20Two studies did not provide quantified results.4863 The general mechanisms through which arsenic could plausibly cause cancer are outlined below. In addition, arsenic in drinking water is well absorbed in the gastro- intestinal tract, and both inorganic arsenic and its methyl- excretion of porphyrins in animals and humans.50 The evidence is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that arsenic is a cause of bladder cancer. General mechanisms \u2014 arsenic Arsenic is carcinogenic to humans and causes chromosomal abnormalities.10It can r esult in changes in the methylation of oncogenes or tumour-suppressor genes. It also interferes with the activities of several enzymes of the haem biosyn-thetic pathway. Exposure to arsenite or arsenate results ingeneration of reduced oxygen species (free radicals) in lab-oratory animals and human cells. Arsenic biotransformationis thought to deplete cells of r educed glutathione, leading to a state of o xidative str ess, characterised by decreased scav- enging of free radicals, which can directly damage DNA and induce cell pr oliferation . 65 There are several compounds suspected to modulate the chronic environmental toxicity of arsenic -- variables thatmay either enhance or suppr ess its genoto xicity and car - cinogenicity. Among them are nutritional factors like sele- nium and zinc, as well as drinking water co-contaminantslike antimony. 66 4.7.5.2 Soft drinks The evidence was too limited in amount, consistency ,or quality to draw any conclusions 4.7.5.3 Fruit juices The evidence was too limited in amount, consistency ,or quality to draw any conclusions. 4.7.5.4 Cof fee Pancreas Eighteen cohort studies,67-8337 case-control studies,77 84-119 and 11 ecological studies120-130investigated coffee and pan - creatic cancer. Seven cohort studies showed increased risk for the high- est intake groups when compared to the lowest,67 68 71 72 78 80which was statistically significant in two.72 80Seven stud- ies showed non-significant decr eased risk.69 70 75 79 81 83Two studies stated that ther ewas no significant effect on risk.77 82One study reported a non-significant increased risk in men and decreased risk in women76;and one study reported a non-significant incr eased risk in women and a non-signifi - 154PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS cant decreased risk in men.74Meta-analysis was possible on eight cohort studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.00 (95% CI 0.94-1.07) per cup/day, with low hetero- geneity (figure 4.7.1). Some, though not all, of the cohort studies suggest a J- shaped dose-response relationship. An effect at high levels ofcoffee consumption cannot be excluded. Case-control studies reported inconsistent results.7784-119 Eighteen studies reported increased risk,84-87 89-91 94 97 99 102- 106 112 114 116 119of which nine were statistically significant.85 87 94 102 112 114Eleven studies reported decreased risk,77 92 93 9596101 107 109 111 113 118which was statistically significant in one.118Three studies showed no effect on risk8898and one study stated there was no significant effect on risk.110Four other studies reported different effects in men and women;however none was statistically significant. 100 108 115 117Meta- analysis was possible on 26 studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.04 (95% CI 1.01-1.07) per cup/day, with mod- erate heterogeneity (figures 4.7.1 and 4.7.2). Studies that did not adjust for smoking behaviour were more likely toreport increased risk. Confounding with smoking could not beexcluded. The ecological studies overall showed an increased mor- tality between coffee consumption and pancreatic cancer. 120- 130Correlation coefficients ranged from +0.15122to +0.59.124 125 There is ample evidence, including prospective data, which is consistent and with low heterogeneity, and which fails to show an association.

The ecological study reported correlation of incidence of 0.62 for men and 0.4 for women. 153 Thereis substantial evidence both fr om cohort and case-control studies, which is consistent and of low heter ogeneity ,and which fails to show an association. It is unlikely that coffee has a substantial effect on the risk of kidney cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study154has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). 4.7.5.5 T ea The evidence was too limited in amount, consistency ,or quality to draw any conclusions. 4.7.5.6 Herbal teas, infusions 4.7.5.6.1 and oesophageal cancer.

The two studies not included in the meta-analysis didnot adjust for smoking; both reported non-significantincreased risk. 156 159 The single ecological study showed a non-significant relationship between increased mat\u00e9 consumption and oesophageal cancer mortality.164 The general mechanisms thr ough which mat\u00e9 could plau - sibly cause cancer are outlined below. The evidence, from case-control studies, is consistent and a dose-response relationship is apparent. There isrobust evidence for plausible mechanisms. Regularconsumption of mat\u00e9, as drunk in the traditional stylein South America, is a probable cause of oesophagealcancer . Mouth, pharynx, and larynx Six case-contr and mouth, pharynx, and larynx cancers.165-170 All six case-control studies showed increased risk for the highest intak egroups when compar ed to the lowest,165-170 which was statistically significant in four.165 167-169 The general mechanisms through which mat\u00e9 could plau- sibly cause cancer are outlined below. The evidence is sparse. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting that mat\u00e9 is a cause of mouth, pharynx, andlarynx cancers. General mechanisms \u2014 mat\u00e9 Mat\u00e9 is typically drunk scalding hot thr ough a metal straw. This produces heat damage in the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and oesophagus. R epeated damage of this natur ecan lead to cancer (also see Chapter 2). Chemical car cinogenesis fr om constituents of mat\u00e9 has also been postulated.171 4.7.5.7 High-temperatur studies162177- 196investigated hot foods or drinks and oesophageal cancer. Two cohort studies showed increased risk for consuming high-temperatur efoods or drinks,173 174which was statisti - cally significant in one.174The other study stated that ther e was no association for hot drinks.175 176Effect estimates were 1.44 (95% CI 0.91-2.26; hot food),173and (95% CI 1.8 (0.96-1.01)Relative risk (95% CI) Coffee (cups/day)12 0.5156PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS hot tea).174Both these studies adjusted for smoking.

The evidence is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that high-temperature drinks are a cause ofoesophageal cancer. 4.7.6 Comparison with previous report Water was not reviewed in the previous report, which had little to say about contaminants in water and did not review arsenic contamination. The previous report did not review soft drinks as such. The previous report judged that green tea possibly protects against stomach cancer, but this was not supported by thecurrent review. The previous report judged that black tea probably has no relationship with cancers of the stomach, pancreas, and kidney. This time the evidence was judged toolimited to draw a clear conclusion .The judgements of the previous report on coffee were practically the same as in this Report, ex cept that the pr evious r eport judged that drinking more than five cups per day was a possible cause of bladder cancer. The evidence now indicates that coffee is unlikely tohave a substantial effect on risk of this cancer. The previousreport judged it possible that mat\u00e9 and other very hot drinksincrease the risk of oesophageal cancer. Since the mid-1990s,agreater body of consistent data has been published on mat\u00e9. Skin cancer was not reviewed in the previous report. 4.7.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The evidence that inorganic arsenic in drinking water is acause of lung cancer is convincing. Water contaminated inthis way is probably a cause of skin cancer. There is limitedevidence suggesting that water contaminated in this way isacause of cancers of the kidney and bladder . Mat\u00e9 is pr obably a cause of oesophageal cancer when drunk scalding hot through a metal straw, as traditional in parts of South America. The temperature is judged to beresponsible for any increased risk of cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that mat\u00e9 as drunk traditionally is a cause of cancers of the mouth, phar ynx, and lar ynx. There is limited evidence suggesting that high-temperatur edrinks are a cause of oesophageal cancer. It is unlikely that coffee has a substantial effect on the risk of cancer either of the pancr eas or of the kidney .

The main alcoholic drinks consumed, in ascending or der of alcohol (ethanol) content, ar ebeers and ciders; wines; wines 'fortified' with spirits; and spirits (liquors) andliqueurs. The alcohol content of the many different drinkswithin each of these categories varies. Alcoholic drinks induce changes in mood; they also produce physical effects such as loss of coordination. Inmost countries they ar ethe legal 'into xicant' of choice, used as a social and pr ofessional lubricant; however , certain cultures forbid the drinking of alcohol. With industrialisation and urbanisation, and the ready availability of alcoholic drinks (which may or may not be taxed), consumption tends to rise. Alcohol relaxes people's social inhibitions, but it is addictive; dependency on alcohol can seriously affectpeople's personal and professional lives. It has been known for a long time that pr olonged high consumption of alcohol is a cause of cirr hosis of the liver , though not all people are equally susceptible. Knowledge ofits other ill-effects is more recent. Overall, the P anel judges that alcoholic drinks ar eacause of cancers of a number of sites and that, in general, the evidence is stronger than it was in the mid-1990s. Theevidence does not show any 'safe limit' of intake. Theeffect is fr om ethanol, irrespective of the type of drink. Ethanol is classified by the International Agency forCancer R esear ch as a human carcinogen. The Panel judges as follows: The evidence that alcoholic drinks ar eacause of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx, oesophagus, color ectum (men), and br east is convincing. They are probably a cause of liver cancer ,and of color ectal cancer in women. It is unlikely that alcoholic drinks have a substantial adverse effect on the risk of kidney cancer. In final summary ,the evidence is that alcoholic drinks are a cause of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx; the oesophagus; the colorectum in men, and the breast; and probably of liver cancer and colorectal cancer inwomen. It is unlikely that alcoholic drinks have asubstantial adverse effect on the risk of kidney cancer . Chapter 4.8 concerns all alcoholic drinks. Alcoholic drinks have been popular in most societies ever 4.8 Alcoholic drinks ALCOHOLIC DRINKS, AND THE RISK OF CANCER In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence. DECREASES RISK INCREASES RISK Exposure Cancer site Exposure Cancer site Convincing Alcoholic drinks Mouth, pharynx and larynx Oesophagus Colorectum (men)1 Liver2 Colorectum (women)1 Limited \u2014 suggestive Substantial effect on risk Alcoholic drinks (adverse effect): kidney3 unlikely 1 The judgements for men and women are different because there are fewer data for women. Increased risk is only apparent above a threshold of 30 g/day of ethanol for both sexes. 2Cirrhosis is an essential pr ecursor of liver cancer caused by alcohol. The Inter national Agency for Research on Cancer has graded alcohol as a class 1 carcinogen for liver cancer. Alcohol alone only causes cirrhosis in the presence of other factors. 3The evidence was suf ficient to judge that alcoholic drinks were unlikely to have an adverse effect on the risk of kidney cancer; it was inadequate to draw a conclusion regarding a protective effect. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. 158PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS since the effects on mood of the fermented products of plant foods and some animal foods were discovered, probably in Palaeolithic or even earlier times. Ethanol is the active ingredient in alcoholic drinks; the con- centration varies, depending on the type of drink. In the past, beers were made from grains, ciders from fruits, mead from honey, and brews from milk; these were followed by wines, generally made from grapes and with higher concentrations of ethanol. The process of distillation was a later invention,which produced more highly concentrated alcoholic drinks made from grains, fruits, sugar, and other substrates. Alcohol is liable to be addictive. Its specific effects are to induce a mood of euphoria and disinhibition, which may be dangerous. Much domestic and other violence, and manyreckless and violent incidents, and crimes such as arson,wounding, homicide, and car crashes, are alcohol-related. Reports concerned with food, nutrition, and the preven- tion of disease have often excluded alcohol. This is because alcohol is also a drug, the impact of which is behavioural andsocial, as well as biological. Mor erecently ,alcoholic drinks have been included in such reports because of the evidence that low to moderate consumption pr otects against cor onary heart disease (but not cerebrovascular disease), and also because of the evidence on cancer, given that ethanol is ahuman carcinogen. 4.8.1 Definitions and sour ces Alcohol is the common term for ethanol, one of a family of alcohols, pr oduced in natur ewhen sugar molecules ar ebro- ken down to release energy by yeasts. This process of fer- mentation is used to produce alcoholic drinks. Alcohol is asource of dietar yenergy (see chapter 4.10.1). It also acts as adrug, affecting both mental and physical responses (alco- hol intoxication). Alcoholic drinks include beers, wines, andspirits. Other alcoholic drinks that may be locally importantinclude fermented milks, fermented honey-water (mead),and fermented apples drinks ar emanufactur ed industrially. Some aremade domestically or illegally ,as 'moonshine' or 'hooch'. 4.8.1.1 Beers Beer,ale, and lager are traditionally produced from barley; today other cereal grains are used. Beer contains between 3 and 7 per cent alcohol. The grain star ches ar econverted to sugars and then fermented by yeasts. The term 'beer 'in this Report includes ales and lagers. 4.8.1.2 W ines Wines are usually produced from grapes and contain between around 9 to 15 per cent alcohol; they are crushedto produce juice and must, which is then fermented. The colour of the grapes and the length of fermentation deter- mine the colour and str ength of the final product. Grape vines gr ow best in temperate r egions. W ines can also be pr o- duced from other fruits and from rice (sake). Here, wine is taken to mean grape wines. Wines may be fortified with spir-its (see chapter 4.8.2.2) to pr oduce drinks of alcohol con -tent between about 16 and 20 per cent. 4.8.1.3 Spirits/liquors Spirits are usually produced from cereal grains and some- times from other plant foods. They are distilled, to give a drink with a higher concentration of ethanol than either beers or wines \u2014 around 35-50 per cent or higher. Some of the most globally familiar spirits are brandy (distilled wine), whisky and gin (distilled from grains), rum (from molasses),aguardente also known as cacha\u00e7a (from sugar), vodka (sometimes from grain, sometimes potatoes), and tequila and mescal (from agave and cactus plants). Spirits and liqueurs are also made from fruits. 4.8.2 Composition Alcohol has an energy content of 7 kilocalories per gram, and is metabolised in the liver. On average, blood alcohol levelsreach a maximum between 30 and 60 minutes after drinking an alcoholic drink, and the body can metabolise 10-15 g alcohol per hour . Alcohol alters the way the central nervous system func- tions. Very high alcohol consumption (where blood alcoholreaches 0.4 per cent) can be fatal, as can long-term, regu-lar, high intakes. 4.8.2.1 Beers Therearemany varieties of beer, with different compositions. Their alcohol content ranges from around 3 to 7 per cent by volume; beers generally contain a variety of bioavailable phenolic and polyphenolic compounds, which contribute to the taste and colour, many of which have antioxidant prop-erties. Beer is also a sour ce of magnesium, potassium, riboflavin, folate, and other B vitamins. 4.8.2.2 Wines The composition of wine depends on the grape varieties used, as well as the gr owing conditions and the wine-making methods, which may var ybetween vineyar ds. The alcohol content ranges fr om ar ound 9 to 15 per cent by volume. Red wines contain high levels of phenolic and polyphenolic com- pounds (up to a total of around 800-4000 mg/l), particu-larly r esveratrol, derived from the grape skins. Like those in beer, these phenolic compounds add taste and colour. White wines contain fewer phenolics. R ed wine has been shown to have antio xidant activity in laborator yexperiments. W ine also contains sugars (mainly glucose and fructose), volatile acids (mainly acetic acid), carboxylic acids, and varying lev-els of calcium, copper ,iron,magnesium, potassium, and vit - amins B1, B2, B6, and C. Wines may be flavoured with herbs and fortified with spirits (see chapter 4.8.2.3) to producedrinks of alcohol content between about 16 and 20 per cent. 4.8.2.3 Spirits/liquors The alcohol content of spirits/liquors and liqueurs is usual - ly between 35 and 50 per cent by volume, but can be even higher. Distilled drinks may have herbs and other ingredi-ents added to give them their distinctive character . 159CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS 4.8.3 Consumption patterns Much of the information on average consumption of alco- holic drinks, internationally and nationally, is not informa-tive. Within almost all populations, consumption varies widely, usually as a function of availability, price, culture or religion, and dependency. In general, men consume sub- stantially more alcoholic drinks than women. In countries where considerable amounts of alcoholic drinks are produceddomestically and by artisanal methods, overall consumption will (if only for this reason) be underestimated. In many countries, alcohol is a public health problem. This is not so much because of the average level of intake, but because a minority of the population, which in high-income countriesincludes an increasing number of young people, drink alco-hol excessively ('binge' drinking). Worldwide, alcoholic drinks supply an average of 2.3 per cent of total dietary energy. This ranges from around 10 per cent in some northern European countries, to (as recorded)practically zer oin Islamic countries. A verage consumption is nearly four times higher in high-income compared with low-income countries, and tends to be highest in Eur ope, North America, and Oceania. Consumption varies within countries: many people do not consume alcoholic drinks,some drink occasionally and others consume 15-25 per centor more of their dietary energy as alcohol. Alcoholic drinks are illegal in Islamic countries. In coun- tries wher ethese drinks are legal, there are often restrictions on price and availability to adults, and in particular to young people. Many countries r ecommend r estriction of alcohol intak e for health reasons. In the USA, men are advised not to exceed two drinks per day and women one drink per day. In the UK,the government advises men not to ex ceed 3-4 units per day and women 2-3 units per day. One US 'drink' is equivalent to about 15 g ethanol, almost two UK units; a unit is 10 mlor 8 g of pure ethanol.4.8.3.1 Beers Beers are the most widely consumed alcoholic drinks world- wide. They provide an average of 1 per cent of dietary ener- gy, with a peak of more than 6 per cent in parts of northernEurope. People living in Europe, North America, and Oceania tend to drink the most beer. 4.8.3.2 Wines Wines provide an average of 0.2 per cent of dietary energy worldwide. They are drunk mainly in Europe, Australasia, and the Americas, with highest levels of consumption in western and southern Europe. 4.8.3.3 Spirits/liquors There are few data on average consumption of spirits/liquors. 4.8.4 Interpretation of the evidence 4.8.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and bo xes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' (RR) is used in this Report to denote ratio measures of effect, of consumption ,the effects of alcohol are heavily confounded by other behaviours, such as smoking tobacco . Reporting bias .Self-reporting of consumption of alcoholic drinks is liable to under estimate consumption ,sometimes grossly, because alcohol is known to be unhealthy and un- desirable, and is sometimes drunk secretly. Heavy drinkersusually underestimate their consumption, as do drinkers ofillegal or unregulated alcoholic drinks. Measur ement .In recent years, the str ength and serving size of some alcoholic drinks have incr eased. F or example, in the UK, wine is commonly served in 250 ml glasses as opposed to the standard 125 or 175 ml glass. In addition, alcohol con-tent of drinks varies widely .Studies that measure consump- tion in terms of number of drinks may be referring to very differ ent amounts of alcohol (also see bo x4.8.1). 4.8.5 Evidence and judgements The full systematic literature review (SLR) is contained on the CD included with this Report. 4.8.5.1 Alcoholic drinks Thereare two different measures of exposure: the number of alcoholic drinks per time period and/or ethanol intak ein grams or millilitres per time period. The former measure is likely to be less precise because the size and strength of eachdrink ar eunknown . The Panel judges that alcoholic drinks are or may be a cause of various cancers, irrespective of the type of alcoholic drink. The causal factor is evidently alcohol (ethanol) itself. There is no sig-nificant evidence that alcohol protects against any cancer. The extent to which alcoholic drinks ar eacause of various cancers depends on the amount of alcohol drunk. Epidemiological studies commonly identify the type of alco- holic drink consumed. Some of the evidence r eviewed in chap - ter 4.8.5 does appear to show that some types of drink seem to have different effects. For example, for cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx, the evidence is stronger for consumption of beer and spirits than for wine. Here is the possibility of resid-ual confounding: wine drinkers in many countries tend to have healthier ways of life than beer or spirit drinkers. Apparent discrepancies in the strength of evidence may also be due partly to variation in the amounts of different types of alcoholic drinks consumed. In general, the evidence suggests similar ef fects for dif ferent types of alcoholic drink.

Meta-analysis was possible on nine case-control studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.03 (95% CI 1.04-1.05), with high heterogeneity. Most studiesadjusted for smoking. One ecological study reported a sig- nificant increased risk; the others tended to show non- significant increased risk in men and non-significant decreased risk in women. The general mechanisms through which alcohol could plausibly cause cancer are outlined below. In addition, alco- hol acts as a synergistic carcinogen with tobacco. Tobacco may induce specific mutations in DNA that are less efficiently repaired in the presence of alcohol. Alcohol may also func- tion as a solvent, enhancing penetration of other carcino-genic molecules into mucosal cells. There is ample and consistent evidence, both from case-control and cohort studies, with a dose-response relationship. There is robust evidence for mechanismsoperating in humans. The evidence that alcoholicdrinks are a cause of mouth, pharynx, and larynxcancers is convincing. Alcohol and tobacco togetherincrease the risk of these cancers more than eitheracting independently. No threshold was identified. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort115and four case-control studies116-119have been pub- lished.

In a separate meta-analysis of nine studies for rectal can- cer,the summary effect estimate was 1.06 (95% CI 1.01-1.12) per 10 g/day ,with low heter ogeneity (figure 4.8.12). It is apparent from the meta-analysis that the report- ed effect for men was lar ger and mor eoften statistically sig - nificant than for women. Stratified meta-analyses for colorectal cancer gave summary effect estimates of 1.09(95% CI 1.02-1.15) for seven studies for men ,and 1.00 (95% CI 0.89-1.40) for three studies for women. There was no statistically significant difference with cancer site. Therewas, however, apparent sexual dimorphism, with a largereffect in men than in women, which explains the bulk of theobser ved heterogeneity.

Pooled analysis from 8 cohort studies (over 475 000 par- ticipants, followed up for 6 to 16 years, mor ethan 4600 col - orectal cancer cases) showed a significant incr eased risk for the highest intake group when compared to the lowest, with an effect estimate of 1.41 (95% CI 1.16-1.72) for those whoconsumed 45 g/day or gr eater . 252No incr eased risk was observed below intakes of 30 g/day. No significant hetero- geneity was observed by sex or cancer site. In addition, a published meta-analysis of 27 studies report- ed a statistically significant increased risk, with a summary effect estimate of 1.10 (95% CI 1.05-1.14) per twodrinks/day . Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarized. The general mechanisms thr ough which alcohol couldplausibly cause cancer ar eoutlined below .In addition ,the association between alcohol intake and colorectal cancer risk is modified by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcoholdehydrogenase genetic status. 253 254Alcohol may induce folate deficiency in the colon and rectum, possibly by reduc-ing absorption of folate or by inhibition of critical enzymes.Also,alcohol may disrupt one-carbon metabolism (see Chapter 2). Intestinal bacteria, because of their high alco - hol dehydrogenase activity, can oxidise ethanol in colorec- tal tissue to pr oduce levels of acetaldehyde up to 1000-fold higher than that in blood. The more elevated risk related to alcohol intake among men compar ed with women may be because of the gener - ally lower consumption of alcohol among women. That is, it is possible that men exhibit a greater range in the amountof alcohol drunk, which makes effects easier to detect. Also,preferred beverages may differ between the sexes, or theremay be hormone-r elated differences in alcohol metabolism or susceptibility to alcohol. There is ample and generally consistent evidence from cohort studies. A dose-response is apparent. There isevidence for plausible mechanisms. The evidence thatconsumption of more than 30 g/day of ethanol fromalcoholic drinks is a cause of color ectal cancer in men is convincing, and pr obably also in women.

These results are particularly hard to interpret as cirrhosis status affects drinking behaviour. Also the can- cer disease path may be different in people with cirrhosis. Assessment of some studies was hampered by poor expo- sure assessment, and not all studies adjusted for known con-founders such as hepatitis B or C virus. The general mechanisms through which alcohol could plausibly cause cancer are outlined below. In addition, reg- ular, high levels of alcohol consumption are known to causeliver damage. T umour pr omotion has been link ed to inflam - mation in the liver through alcohol-associated fibrosis and hepatitis. 488 489Alcohol consumption ,even at moderate lev - els, is associated with increases in levels of circulating hepati- tis C virus RNA in carriers. Hepatitis C virus infection ishighly prevalent among alcoholics with chronic liver diseaseand appears to accelerate the course of alcoholic liver disease(see chapter 7.8). Thereis ample, generally consistent evidence fr om both cohort and case-control studies. A dose-response relationship is appar ent. Alcohol is a cause of cirr hosis that predisposes to liver cancer, but the factors that determine why some people are susceptible tocirrhosis ar enot known. Alcoholic drinks ar ea probable cause of liver cancer. No threshold was identified. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-contr ol study490has been published.

It is unlikely that alcohol increases the risk of kidney cancer ,though a protective effect cannot be excluded.

This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). General mechanisms Evidence suggests that reactive metabolites of alcohol, such asacetaldehyde, may be carcinogenic. Additionally, the effects of alcohol may be mediated through the production of prostaglandins, lipid peroxidation, and the generation offree-radical oxygen species. Alcohol also acts as a solvent, enhancing penetration of carcinogens into cells. Alcohol has been demonstrated to alter retinoid status in rodent studies and, as a result, cellular growth, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis are adversely altered. For all these pathways,genetic polymorphisms might also influence risk. 398 Lastly, heavy consumers of alcohol may have diets deficient in essential nutrients, making tissue susceptible to carcinogenesis. 4.8.6 Comparison with previous report In general, the evidence that alcohol is a cause of a number of cancers has become stronger since the mid-1990s. Theprevious report did not find any distinctions between different types of alcoholic drink. This finding is upheld. The previous report identified a threshold of modest consumption of alcoholic drinks, below which no effect oncancer risk was obser ved, with the ex ception of breast can- cer. Current evidence does not identify a generally 'safe' threshold. Current evidence strengthens the previous judgements on colorectal and breast cancers. 4.8.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : Evidence that alcoholic drinks of any type ar eacause of various cancers has, on the whole, str engthened. The evidence that alcoholic drinks ar eacause of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx, oesophagus, colorectum (men), and breast is convincing. They are probably a causeof color ectal cancer in women, and of liver cancer. It is unlikely that alcoholic drinks have a substantial adverse effect on the risk of kidney cancer . 172PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Practically all food and drink is changed before it is consumed, for instance by peeling or cooking. Themajority of foods and drinks consumed by most people around the world are now modified in many more ways. Products on sale in supermarkets, small shops, and otherretail outlets are chilled, pasteurised, canned, bottled,vacuum packed, or otherwise packaged. Most contain anumber of ingredients, some of which are also processed.The use of ingredients such as modified starches, added sugars, hydrogenated fats, and also additives used as bulking aids, preservatives, colours, flavours, sweeteners,and for other purposes, is common. In general, rises inconsumption of fats, oils, and added sugars occur becauseof their incr eased use in pr ocessed foods and drinks. Animal and plant products both contain traces of agricultural chemicals. Methods of industrial and domesticfood preparation and cooking change the nature of food aseaten. It is possible that processing and/or preserving methods may alter the natur eof food. Different methods of food preservation and pr ocessing may be protective, causative, or neutral in their effects on the risk of cancer. It is for this r eason that the P anel decided that, as far as practically possible, the evidence on methods of foodproduction, preservation, processing, and preparation(including cooking) should be summarised and judged inthe context of the relevant foods and drinks. Most of thisevidence is to be found in the previous sections ofChapter 4. This section summarises other information and findings concerning the ways in which foods and drinks ar e changed befor econsumption. These include wher edata from animal and other experimental studies ar enot supported by evidence from epidemiological studies. Such studies are often carried out for the purposes ofestablishing r egulations for the safety in use of chemicals known to be toxic, but may use levels of exposure far higher than occur in foods and drinks. In line with its general criteria for judgement ,the P anel decided to make no judgements on experimental findings alone that are not supported by epidemiological or other evidence. Nevertheless, the P anel concurs that, in general, it seems reasonable to conclude that the changes made to foods and drinks within well regulated, modern food systems, and made to foods and drinks as usuallyprepared and cooked, are of themselves unlikely to modifythe risk of cancer significantly .For this reason, no matrix showing P anel judgements is included in this section. In line with its general criteria for judgement ,the Panel has decided to make no judgements on experimental findings fr om studies using doses of substances at levelsfar above those found in foods and drinks, many if not most of which are conducted to guide toxicologicalregulations. The Panel also concurs that changes made to processed foods and drinks within well regulated, modern food systems are of themselves unlikely to modify the riskof cancer significantly. For this reason, no matrix showingPanel judgements is included in this section. Those aspectsof food production, preservation, processing, andpreparation that have been examined in epidemiological as well as experimental settings are discussed and judged in earlier sections of Chapter 4. This section summarises some of the general methods by which foods and drinks may be changed during their pro- duction, preservation, processing, and preparation (includ-ing cooking) that may be relevant to the risk of cancer.Almost all foods and drinks are altered \u2014 processed, in ageneral sense of the word \u2014 before being consumed. Reports concerned with the prevention of chronic diseases often mention the added nutritional value of lightly processed cereals (grains), and of vegetables and fruits. Butthey may not mak emuch distinction between foods and drinks as such, and as modified in production, preservation, processing, and preparation. Previous reports concerned withcancer have concluded that some methods of food and drinkmodification can produce carcinogens in experimental set-tings, and that this might reasonably influence cancer risk.Storage conditions that allow contamination of cereals(grains) and other plant foods by aflatoxins, and the prepa-ration of fish Cantonese-style by salting and fermentation , have pr eviously been identified as causes of cancer . This section covers aspects of food pr oduction ,preserva- tion, processing, and preparation that are sometimes thought to be relevant to the risk of cancer, but where experimentalinformation (when this exists) is not supported by epidemi - ological evidence or where there is no such evidence. Where the evidence for foods or drinks is sufficient to judge thatthey may cause or pr otect against any cancer ,this is sum - marised and judged in earlier sections of this chapter. For example, see chapter 4.1 for the Panel's findings on aflatoxincontamination; for pr ocessed meat and also cooking meth - ods, see chapter 4.3; for salting, see chapter 4.6. 4.9.1 Production Modern food systems (bo x4.9.1) involve various aspects of food production that have some potential to modify the risk of cancer. A clear benefit of these systems of production, dis-tribution ,and r etail sale, with chilling used at all stages, is 4.9 Food production, preservation, processing, and preparation173CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS the all-year round supply of fresh vegetables and fruits (see chapter 4.2). The industrialised farming methods that are part of most modern food systems in most countries use various tech-nologies to maximise production. These include the use of fertilisers, pesticides, and herbicides on food crops; and of veterinary drugs in rearing livestock and in aquaculture. Fertilisers play a part in determining nutrient levels in plants, as well as potentially modifying concentrations of otherbioactive microconstituents. Residues of these and other chemicals applied to crops are washed from soils by the rain and can contaminate water supplies. See boxes 4.9.2 and 4.9.3. Methods or consequences of food production, where epi- demiological evidence shows or suggests an effect on the riskof cancer, are summarised and judged earlier in this chapter.These are fungal contamination (chapter 4.1), hot drinks and foods (chapter 4.7), and arsenic contamination (chapter 4.7). 4.9.1.1 Pesticides and herbicides The use of synthetic pesticides and herbicides has increased vastly since the middle of the 20th century. Nearly 2500 tonnes of these chemicals were used worldwide in 2001.1 The chlorinated pesticide dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro- ethane (DDT) has been banned from use in many countries. Other organochlorine pesticides are now largely being replaced with organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides. These newer types are less persistent in the environment,and have not been found to be carcinogenic in experimen- tal settings. In many countries, the use of pesticides and herbicides is regulated to minimise residues in foods and drinks, and there are internationally recommended maximum residue limits(box 4.9.3). The use of persistent organic pollutants(organochlorine pesticides, furans, dioxins, and polychlori-nated biphenyls) will be banned by 2025 under the United Nations Environment Programme's Stockholm Convention, which entered into force in May 2004. Many of these contaminants have the potential to accu - mulate within food systems, and residues of pesticides and herbicides that have been banned fr om use, or ar ebeing phased out, may still be present in foods eaten today. Some contaminants, such as heavy metals and persistent organiccompounds, tend to be deposited in fatty tissues and are noteasily metabolised or excreted. They accumulate in livingcreatures, in amounts higher than background levels (forinstance, in the soil). Dietar yexposure increases with each step up the food chain ,as pr edators consume prey contam- inated with these residues. Therearetheor etical gr ounds for concern, which are con- stantly reviewed by international and national regulatory bodies. However, there is no epidemiological evidence thatcurrent exposur es arecauses of cancers in humans, and so the Panel has made no judgements. Nevertheless, a precau- tionary approach is wise for women of reproductive age,since vulnerability during embryonic phases of developmentis increased, and early exposure may result in increased riskat later stages in life. 4.9.1.2 V eterinar ydrugs Industrial animal production, as distinct from 'organic' farm- ing (box 4.9.2), requires constant use of antimicrobial drugsto treat and prevent infectious diseases, and promote growth. Residues of these antimicrobials can be found in foods and drinks, normally at levels lower than internationally r ecom - mended maximum r esidue limits (bo x4.9.3). When anti - microbials have been found to be carcinogenic in animals, their licence for that use has been withdrawn. Hormonal anabolic agents ar eused in animal husbandr y in some countries, including the USA, to prevent and ter- minate pregnancy in cows and to promote growth. Their usehas been banned in other countries as well as in the European Union. Hormones designed to stimulate milk pro- duction include bovine somatotr opin and porcine soma- totropin.Many hormones have been found multisite carcinogens in experimental settings. 2These include oestro- gens, classed as group 1, human carcinogens, by theInternational Agency for R esear ch on Cancer (IAR C), prog- Food systems involve the pr oduction, preservation, processing, and pr eparation (including cooking) of food. Gather er-hunters take food as it is found in nature and modify it by the use of fire. Pastoralists modify the animals that are a source of their foodthrough br eeding. Agricultur eimproves plants for human food use, by selective breeding and planting, and animals too are sub- ject to selective br eeding. In Egypt, selectively br ed wheat was ground into flour, kneaded with water and other ingredients,and baked into bread as early as 4000 years ago. Thousands of years before industrialisation, most food and drink consumed by the majority of people was modified in some way in its production. This included preservation by drying, and later other methods such as salting, fermenting, pickling, curing,spicing, and fr eezing in cold climates; and various methods of preparation and cooking, including boiling and roasting. Food systems were transformed as part of the industrial and later, the technological revolution. But this was not the point atwhich foods and drinks became modified for the first time. Rather ,many new pr ocesses wer edeveloped such as sterile bot - tling and canning. Then, beginning in the late 19th century, steel roller mills were devised for the mass-manufacture of white flour and thus white bread; refrigerated transport using railways and ships made possible the industrial production and internationalexport of meat and dairy products. In the 20th century, com- mercialisation of the hydr ogenation pr ocess to turn liquid oils into solid fats made margarine manufacture a big business, and the mass manufacture of soft drinks developed. What is now known as 'conventional' far ming, making exten - sive use of chemical fer tilisers, herbicides, and pesticides, and feed concentrates for animals, developed mainly in the second half of the 20th century. More recent developments in food sys- tems include the use of containers to transport foods and drinksnationally and internationally; the development of supermar- kets, of which the biggest ar enow transnational; and the incr eas- ing concentration of food producers, manufacturers, retailers, and caterers.Box 4.9.1 Food systems174PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS estins (IAR 2B, possible human car cinogens), and also testosterone (IARC group 1, human carcinogens). The toxicity of antimicrobial drugs is constantly reviewed byinternational and national regulatory bodies. The Panel notes the findings on hormonal anabolic agents and also the lack of epidemiological evidence. Because ther eis no sup- porting epidemiological or other evidence, the P anel made no judgements. 4.9.1.3 Genetic modification Plant br eeding is a process of genetic exchange which is often undertaken with the purpose of acquiring traits that are either beneficial to humans or incr ease yield. Mor erecently, the use of new technologies of genetic modification ,intrin - sic to agriculture and animal husbandry from their begin- nings, has raised great public interest and controversy. Manycrops ar enow genetically modified by means of gene trans - fer within and between species. Potential uses of modern genetic modification technology in food production includechanging nutritional composition (for example, beta- carotene in 'golden rice'); increasing the hardiness of pest or disease resistance; and increasing herbi- cide tolerance in cr op plants (to allow the use of generic herbicides). Not all genetic modifications include transgenes, in which agene fr om one species is transferr ed acr oss species, or evenkingdoms \u2014 that is to say, from plants to animals. Some genetic modifications involve only inactivating existing genes. For example, tomatoes have been genetically modi- fied to render inactive the enzyme that softens the tomatoonce ripe; thus, the tomato remains hard despite being ripe. This is beneficial for transport and storage purposes. The production and use of transgenic and genetically mod- ified foods for humans or animal consumption are regulat- ed in most but not all countries. The regulations require thatall genetically modified foods be of equivalent safety as the food they are replacing, both nutritionally and toxicologically. Any effect of genetically modified foods on risk of human disease might be a result of changes in the types of chemi-cal pesticides or herbicides used, rather than of genetic mod-ification itself. Genetically modified crops may require lessuse of pesticides and herbicides. Any effect of modern methods of genetic modification of foods on the risk of cancer is unknown. Because there is nosupporting epidemiological or other evidence, the P anel made no judgements. Thereis too little evidence to draw any conclusion about the association between methods of production and risk of cancer. 4.9.2 Preservation Methods of pr eserving foods have probably been in use since before recorded history began. Gatherer-hunter and peas- ant-agricultural food systems (see chapter 1.1) include various techniques to preserve foods, which remain in use, such as drying, underground storage, fermenting, smoking,and salting. A range of other methods of pr eservation accom - panies, and is part of, industrialisation and urbanisation. These include canning, bottling, refrigeration, heat treat-ment, and irradiation. Methods of food preservation, where epidemiological evi- dence shows or suggests an effect on the risk of cancer ,are summarised and judged earlier in this chapter .These ar e refrigeration (bo x4.6.4); processing meat ('processed meat' refers to red meats preserved by smoking, curing, or salting, or by the addition of chemicals, see box 4.3.1 in chapter 4.3);preserving fish Cantonese-style (see box 4.3.5 in chapter 4.3); and salting (chapter 4.6). 4.9.2.1 Dr ying Drying is an ancient method used to preserve cereals (grains), pulses (legumes), fruits, and other plant foods. Itis also used to pr eserve meat and fish, often as part of anoth - er preservation process such as salting (see box 4.3.5 in chap- ter 4.3). Freeze-drying, where the food is frozen and thewater extracted, has been in commercial use since the mid- 20th century, and is used to preserve fruits, herbs, meat, fish, milk, eggs, coffee, and other foods. 4.9.2.2 Fermenting Fermentation is an ancient method used to preserve many foods and drinks. It may originally have been discover ed by So-called 'organic' farming is essentially a reversion to, or revival of, methods of agriculture that were the standard until the intro- duction of farming systems dependent on chemical fertilisers, pesticides, and biocides, in the second half of the 20th century. Organic farming avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, plant growth regulators, and livestock feed additives. Farmers tend to rely on crop rotation, crop residues, animal manures, and mechanical cultivation to main- tain soil productivity, and to supply plant nutrients and control weeds, insects, and other pests. Organic farming is intended to beindefinitely sustainable. This type of farming has become well established within Europe and is expanding at a steady rate. More than 10 per cent offarms in Austria, Switzerland, and several other countries use organic methods. The retail market for organic farming in high-income countries hasgrown about 20 per cent each year since the early 1990s due toincreasing consumer demand. Production and distribution have become correspondingly large scale. The variety and avail- ability of processed organic food has increased dramatically, andthe cost \u2014 which was initially high \u2014 is continuing to fall. Claims that foods produced by organic methods are biologi- cally or nutritionally superior to food produced by intensive methods are not supported by clinical or epidemiological evi-dence, but some food compositional data indicates higher con - centrations of some constituents like vitamin C and dietar yfibre. There is evidence that organic products contain fewer residues from chemicals employed in conventional agriculture. However,the subject r emains a matter of contr oversy .Box 4.9.2 'Organic' farming175CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS accident, because foods ferment as a result of the action of bacteria or moulds (yeasts). Fermentation has special fea- tures. It characteristically changes the sensory and nutri- tional qualities of foods and drinks: for example, bacterialfermentation turns milk into yoghurt and cabbage into kim- chi (a staple food in Korea) and sauerkraut. Fermentation byyeasts turns sugar into alcohol, and so is an essential part of the process by which cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, and other plant foods are the basis for beers, wine, andspirits. 4.9.2.3 Canning, bottling Bottling and canning were first developed around 1800. The process involves heating or cooking fruits, vegetables, meats,and other foods in containers, then sealing them while stillhot. Glass bottles were first used, and then cans. 4.9.2.4 Pasteurisation Heat can be used to preserve milk and fruit juices by pas- teurisation ,which kills many micr o-organisms. This involves various methods of rapid heating to a specific temperature, maintaining that temperatur efor a set period of time, fol - lowed by rapid cooling. 4.9.2.5 Chemical preservation Chemical preservative additives are added to perishable processed foods. Antimicrobials inhibit the growth of bac-teria and fungi. Antio xidants reduce the rate at which lipids areoxidised through exposure to air, which leads to rancid- ity. A third type blocks the natural ripening processes that continue to occur in plant foods following har vest. The most commonly used antimicrobial preservatives are benzoates, nitrites (see box 4.3.2 in chapter 4.3), and sulphites. Thereareinternationally specified limits for levels of chemical preservatives in foods and drinks. 4.9.2.6 Irradiation Irradiation was first patented at the beginning of the 20th centur yas a means of preserving food using ionising radia- tion.The pr ocess has been tested extensively, but there is considerable public suspicion over the safety of irradiatedfoods. For example, 2-alkylcyclobutanones, which interact with DNA in laboratory settings, are found exclusively inirradiated foods. Methods of preservation tend to improve food security and enable mor ereliable availability of food, but may have adverse effects too .Some methods of food pr eservation such as drying are almost certainly benign, and others like fer- mentation may have some beneficial effects. The toxicity ofpreservatives and pr eservation methods is constantly reviewed by international and national regulatory bodies. Because experimental data are not supported by epidemio-logical or other evidence, the Panel made no judgements. There is too little evidence to draw any conclusion about the association between methods of pr eservation and risk of cancer .4.9.3 Processing Food processing transforms basic ingredients into manufac- tured foods and drinks. In the broad sense of the word, foodproduction, processing, preservation, and preparation are methods of processing. The term 'processing' here is used to refer to techniques and technologies other than methods of preservation that are used by manufacturers of industrialised processed foods. The processes that take place in kitchens(commercial or domestic) are considered in chapter 4.9.4. Methods of food processing, where there is evidence that they may affect the risk of cancer, are summarised and judged earlier in this chapter. These are hydrogenation (chapter 4.5); refining (chapters 4.1 and 4.6); and the pro-duction of alcohol by fermentation (chapter 4.8). 4.9.3.1 Additives Many if not most processed foods contain additives. These may be synthetic, 'nature-identical', or natural. As well aspreservatives, these include bulking aids, colours, flavours, solvents, and many other categories. For general issues of toxicity in use, see bo x4.9.3. Additives mentioned her eare some of those where issues of carcinogenicity have arisen (also see box 4.9.4). Flavours Alkenylbenzenes are a group of naturally occurring flavours, some of which have been found to cause liver cancer in Any chemicals that have a useful function in the production, processing, or preservation of foods or drinks may nevertheless be toxic, and possibly mutagenic or carcinogenic. For this rea- son, food additives and contaminants, such as traces of chemi - cals used in industrial agricultural pr oduction, ar esubject to international and national surveillance and regulations. They are a cause for concern and vigilance because some, and in particular agricultural chemicals, are known to be toxic in experimental settings, though at levels well above those found in foods and drinks. There is little epidemiological evidence on the possible effects of contaminants and additives as present in foods and drinks. Because contaminants and additives are subject to interna- tional and national regulation, there is a vast amount of toxi- cological infor mation fr om experiments on laborator yanimals and other settings. Failing any other method, it seems reason- able to observe the effects of food additives and contaminants on laboratory animals at levels greatly in excess of any likely tobe present in foods and drinks; and based on several assump-tions and judgements, to set limits for safety in use. When suchlimits are used as regulatory limits, they are also subject to sur-veillance and special investigation when any chemical present in foods and drinks seems to be a cause for special concern. This ar ea remains controversial. Theoretically, it would be ideal if food supplies contained no trace of any toxic substance, including those that ar eor may be mutagenic or car cinogenic. However ,some foods in natur econtain car cinogens and the issue is not confined to methods of industrial food processing. Box 4.9.3 Regulation of additives and contaminants176PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS rodents at levels vastly higher than normal human dietary intakes.3 Colours About 50 colour compounds are permitted for use in foods.4 The number varies in different countries. Various azo dyes and other colours found to be carcinogenic in experimentalsettings have been withdrawn fr om use. Those dyes now r egulated for use in food ar ejudged by UN and other expert committees not to be car cinogenic in theamounts found in foods and drinks. The xanthene colour erythrosine and ammonia caramel (a class 3 carcinogen,accor ding to IARC) cause cancers in rats given high doses, but are judged to be safe as now used. 10 Solvents Around 20 solvents are permitted for food use.4Two \u2014 dichloromethane and trichloroethylene \u2014 once used wide-lyfordecaffeinating coffee and tea, have been classified by IARC as possibly and probably carcinogenic to humans, respectively. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on FoodAdditives has recommended that use of these solvents should berestricted, and that levels in food should be as low as tech- nologically possible. 10These solvents ar enow generally not used for decaffeination . 4.9.3.2 Packaging Foods and drinks can become contaminated with traces ofchemicals that migrate from packaging materials such as plastic wrappings and bottles, and metal cans. Migration from food-contact materials can occur during the processing, storage, and preparation of food. The polymers used in plas-tic packaging are biologically inert, but their monomers such as vinyl chloride, acrylonitrile, and acrylamide can and do migrate into foods. Plasticisers such as phthalates, used in the manufacture of these polymers, can also migrate into foods and drinks. These are mutagenic or carcinogenic inexperimental animals. Nonylphenol and bisphenol-A, used inpackaging, mimic the action of oestrogens in the body. Synthetic oestrogens in the diet are not readily excreted and may therefore accumulate in the body. The potential effects of industrial food-processing meth- ods and of additives and contaminants in foods and drinkson carcinogenicity are constantly reviewed by internationaland national regulatory bodies. In view of the lack of sup- porting epidemiological or other evidence, the Panel made no judgements. There is too little evidence to draw any con-clusion about the association between methods of pr eserva- tion and risk of cancer. 4.9.4 Preparation 'Preparation' here means domestic cooking or the cooking done in industrial kitchens, by caterers for indirect or directsale. Methods of food pr eparation ,where epidemiological evi- dence shows or suggests an effect on the risk of cancer, are summarised and judged earlier in this chapter .These ar e grilling (broiling) and barbecuing (charbroiling) animal foods (chapter 4.3), and carcinogenic compounds generat-ed by cooking these foods in a flame or at ver yhigh tem - peratures (see box 4.3.4 in chapter 4.3), and 'fast foods' (Chapter 8). 4.9.4.1 Industrial cooking Ready-to-heat and ready-to-eat dishes sold in supermarkets and other r etail outlets ar eamassively increasing market. Like'fast foods' sold for immediate consumption ,these are usually energy dense (see Chapter 8). Intense and prolonged industrial cooking of starch-based foods such as crisps(chips), F rench fries (chips), and other snack foods, gener- ates acrylamides, classified by IARC as 'probably carcinogenic to humans'. A tthe time when this R eport was completed, acrylamides wer ethe subject of special sur veillance and study. 4.9.4.2 Steaming, boiling, stewing These are methods of cooking at up to 100\u00b0C. Some labile water-soluble vitamins are destroyed or lost in this process. 4.9.4.3 Baking, roasting These ar emethods of cooking at up to 200\u00b0C, but not on a direct flame. During baking, the high temperatur es areusu- ally reached only on the surface of the food, while the inner parts often remain below 100\u00b0C. Traditional forms of roast-ing usually involve basting foods with oils or fats. Inthe early 1940s, people who lived where drinking water sup- plies had higher naturally occurring fluoride levels were foundto have less dental caries than people who lived in areas with lower naturally occurring fluoride levels. This finding is supported by more recent studies. 5 Where natural fluoride levels are low, fluoride compounds are sometimes added to water supplies in order to reduce dental caries in the general population. Most cities in the USA now fluoridate their water supplies; most of Europe does not. The advisability of fluoridation is dis- puted: fluoride can have adverse effects at doses not much abovethat recommended for prevention of dental caries, and excess can cause dental fluorosis and bone fragility. Studies in experimental animals have identified an increased risk of osteosarcomas (bone cancers) when exposed to water con- taining high concentrations of fluoride. A report published in the USA in 2006 consider ed all the available evidence on fluoride and osteosarcoma and found the overall evidence to be tentative and mixed, and made no recommendations for revising current avail- able fluoride levels in drinking water . 6Astudy published later in 2006 suggested an association between drinking fluoridated water and osteosar coma in adolescent men.7However ,prelimi- nary analysis of a second set of cases from the same study does not replicate the findings.8The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to support community water fluori-dation as a safe and ef fective public health measur eto pr event and control tooth decay. These findings are not the basis for any judgement. 9Box 4.9.4 Water fluoridation177CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS 4.9.4.4 Microwaving Microwaving exposes food to temperatures up to 200\u00b0C. Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation. They cause vibration of water molecules, which produces heat.There is no evidence that microwaves have any specific effect on food composition beyond that of heat. 4.9.4.5 Frying, grilling (broiling), barbecuing (charbroiling) Also see box 4.3.4 in chapter 4.3. Frying, grilling (broiling), and barbecuing (charbroiling) generate temperatures of up to 400\u00b0C, and sometimes use a direct flame to cook food. These methods create high levels of carcinogenic com- pounds. For any cooking involving wood fires, the type ofwood used can also be an important factor in determiningwhich chemicals contaminate the food. Hardwoods such asoak and hickory burn cleanly; others such as mesquite gen- erate copious quantities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Because of the experimental evidence of carcinogen pro- duction ,it is prudent not to consume burned or charr ed foods frequently or in large amounts. Industrial food prepa- ration methods ar eregulated. Because ther eis no support - ing epidemiological or other evidence, the Panel made no judgements. There is too little evidence to draw any conclusion about the association between methods of preparation and risk ofcancer. 4.9.5 Interpretation of the evidence 4.9.5.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and bo xes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. Aspects of food production, preservation, processing, and preparation (including cooking), where epidemiological evi-dence enables judgements to be made, are summarised, withPanel judgements, in previous sections of this chapter. 4.9.5.2 Specific Measurement .It is practically impossible to measure small amounts of additives and trace amounts of contaminants infoods and drinks ex cept by analysis. Epidemiological stud- ies using usual methods of dietary assessment are therefore generally uninformative. Terminology .The terms used for different types of cooking vary around the world. 'Broiling' in the USA is called 'grilling'in other countries. 'Barbecuing' may mean grilling in flame orslow cooking near smoking embers. Results of studies in these areas need to be interpreted with care, given that car-cinogenic compounds are particularly generated when meat and other animal and plant foods are cooked in a flame, and even mor eso when they are burned or charred. Study design .Practically all studies of the topics covered in this section are laboratory experiments on animals. They arecommonly carried out to assess to xicity to determine safetyin use, as a basis for food safety regulations. The relevance of such work to the actual levels consumed of substances identified in this section is obscure. Also, it is commonly agreed, as in this Report, that information from animal andother experimental settings, which is unsupported by evi- dence from epidemiological studies, is not a sound basis for firm judgements. Confounding .Studies commonly report the difficulty in sep- arating out specific methods of processing or cooking, when foods are characteristically processed and prepared in a num- ber of different ways. 4.9.6 Evidence and judgements The Panel decided to make no judgements on experimental findings of toxicity that are not supported by epidemiologi- cal or other evidence. The evidence consider ed by the P anel is in the systemat - ic literature review (SLR). Because the Panel made no judge- ment on the isolated experimental data, this evidence is not summarised separately here. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 4.9.7 Comparison with pr evious report In general, the previous report found that information from animal and other experimental settings unsupported by epi - demiological evidence, was not a basis for judgement. In this respect, the view of the Panel responsible for this Report issimilar .The findings of the pr evious r eport on food additives, microbial contaminants, salt and salted foods, salted fish (Cantonese-style), cured meats, and the grilling and barbe-cuing of meat, fish, and other foods, were all contained inachapter on food processing. The previous panel's judge- ments wer emostly similar to those made here, with the important ex ception of pr ocessed meat, which was not con- sidered separately fr om smoked and cured meats by the pre- vious report. The judgements of this Report on these subjects are made in previous sections of this chapter. 4.9.8 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The Panel decided to make no judgements on isolated exper- imental findings that wer enot supported by epidemiologi - cal or other evidence. It is not possible to make any definitive judgement in the absence of epidemiological evidence. Nevertheless, the Panel concurs that, in general, it seems reasonable to conclude that the changes made to foods and drinks within well r egulat- ed, modern food systems, and those made to foods anddrinks as usually prepared and cooked, are of themselves unlikely to modify the risk of cancer significantly. Thereareimportant ex ceptions to this tentative conclusion 178PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS and in these cases, the Panel's judgements and conclusions are found in the relevant earlier sections of this chapter. These judgements and conclusions are made in those sec- tions wherever epidemiological and other evidence justifiesajudgement of a protective or causative effect, using the agreed criteria, for aspects of food production (including contamination), processing, preservation, and preparation (including cooking). 179CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS Nutritional science conventionally divides foods and drinks into their chemical constituent parts, such as water , carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Their biological functions are then explored, singly or incombination. It is now incr easingly agreed by the nutrition science community that research and also public health can additionally benefit fr om a mor eintegrated approach, inwhich the emphasis is placed on foods and drinks. In this Report, the evidence, its summaries, and the Panel'sjudgements are food-based, wherever possible. Here, the evidence on macr onutrients, micr onutrients (isolated in the form of supplements), and bioactive constituents of plant foods (also known as phytochemicals) is summarised and judged. Overall, the Panel judges that the evidence that dietary macr onutrients specifically affect the risk of cancer is unimpr essive. The evidence, based on observational data and randomised controlled trials of supplements, that certain vitamins and minerals affect the risk of specificcancers is, in some cases, impr essive. The P anel judges as follows: The evidence that high-dose beta-car otene supplements are a cause of lung cancer in tobacco smokers is convincing. There is limited evidence suggesting that high-dose r etinol supplements are a cause of lung cancer in tobacco smokers. Calcium pr obably pr otects against colorectal cancer. At specific doses, selenium pr obably pr otects against pr ostate cancer. It is unlikely that beta-carotene has a substantial effect on the risk of either pr ostate cancer or non-melanoma skin cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that retinol at specific doses protects against squamous cell carcinoma ofthe skin. There is also limited evidence suggesting thatalpha-tocopher ol protects against prostate cancer, and that selenium at specific doses pr otects against color ectal and lung cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that selenium supplements are a cause of skin cancer. Within the r emit of this R eport, the strongest evidence, 4.10 Dietary constituents and supplements DIETARY CONSTITUENTS AND SUPPLEMENTS, AND THE RISK OF CANCER Inthe judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence. DECREASES RISK INCREASES RISK Exposure Cancer site Exposure Cancer site Convincing Beta-carotene Lung supplements1 Beta-carotene7:prostate; skin (non-melanoma) unlikely 1 The evidence is derived from studies using high-dose supplements (20 mg/day for beta-carotene; 25 000 international units/day for retinol) in smokers. 2 The evidence is derived from studies using supplements at a dose of 200 \u00b5g/day.3 The evidence is derived from studies using supplements at 200 \u00b5g/day. Selenium is toxic at high doses. 4The evidence is derived fr om studies using supplements at a dose of 25 000 inter national units/day. 5Applies only to squamous cell car cinoma. 6The evidence is derived from studies using supplements at a dose of 200 \u00b5g/day. Selenium is toxic at high doses. 7 The evidence is derived from studies using supplements (at doses of 20, 30, 50 mg for prostate, and doses of 30, 50 mg/day for skin), and foods containing beta-car otene: see chapter 4.2. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. 180PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS corresponding to judgements of 'convincing' or 'probable', shows that high-dose beta-carotene supplements intobacco smokers are a cause of lung cancer; that calciumprobably protects against colorectal cancer; and thatselenium probably protects against prostate cancer. It isunlikely that beta-carotene, or foods containing it, have asubstantial effect on the risk of either prostate or skin (non-melanoma) cancer. The Panel emphasises that this evidence and these judgements relate to thesemicronutrients only at the specified doses. Nutrition science in its conventional form as a biological dis- cipline was created in the early 19th century following theidentification of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. As nutri-ents, these all supply energy and are essential for tissue struc-ture and function, and physical and mental growth and development. Later research has divided these macronutri- ents into many constituent parts such fatty acids (which themselves have many fractions); and amino acids. Many of these constituents of the main nutrients are known to have different metabolic, physiological, biochemical, andother effects, in isolation or combination. Beginning in the early 20th century, a series of substances that do not supply energy were identified also as being vitalto life, typically in ver ysmall amounts: these are vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Mor erecently a large number of other substances that are not nutrients, in the sense of being essential components of metabolic pr ocesses or cell structure, have been identified as bioactive. Because these are contained in plants, they are commonly known asphytochemicals. Reports concerned with specifying recommended dietary (or daily) amounts or reference values for nutrients, by theirnature, are structured accordingly. Compilations of the chem-ical composition of foods, used as standard references in epi-demiological studies of food, nutrition ,and the risk of diseases including cancer ,also specify macr o- and micro- constituents of foods and drinks, to varied degr ees of com - pleteness and accuracy. Reports concerned with nutritional deficiencies charac- teristically mak erecommendations for the relevant micro- constituents. Increasingly though, they often now make recommendations for dietar ypatterns, diets, and foods and drinks that ar ehigh in the micr oconstituents with which they are concerned. So a report on vitamin A deficiency may spec- ify foods high in carotenoids and retinol, and may also rec-ommend methods of agricultur ethat emphasise such foods. Reports concerned with prevention of chronic diseases were initially structured in terms of dietary constituents, with onlysecondary reference to foods. But following a general inter- national agreement that food-based dietary guidelines are moreuseful, and often better reflect the science, such reports now give mor eemphasis to foods and drinks, both in their analysis of evidence and in their recommendations. The policy of this Report is to always emphasise foods and drinks. Thus, earlier sections of this chapter include sum -maries and judgements of the evidence on dietary fibre, vit- amins, minerals, and trace elements as contained in foods, and also on fats, oils, sugars, salt, and alcohol as foods. Also see chapters 4.1 to 4.8. This section is concerned with macro-nutrients and micronutrients as such, and with non-nutrient bioactive constituents of food (phytochemicals). 4.10.1 Macronutrients Chemically, macronutrients are classified as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and these categories have many sub- classifications. Diets need to include adequate amounts of macronutrients for physical and mental growth and devel-opment, and for maintenance of normal tissue structure andfunction. All macronutrients supply energy. Alcohol alsosupplies energy, but there is no requirement for it. Also see chapter 4.8. 4.10.1.1 Carbohydrates Carbohydrates consist of monosaccharide sugars, or larger molecules of these units joined together :disaccharides (two units), oligosaccharides (a few), or polymers (many). For instance, glucose is a monosaccharide and starch is a poly-mer of glucose units. Polysaccharides are sometimes called'complex' carbohydrates and sugars 'simple' carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are generally the largest single source of energy in diets. They supply around 4 kilocalories per gram. They form part of important structural components in the body and, in the form of glucose, are the principal and pre-ferred ener gy sour ce for metabolism. They also play major roles in several essential cellular and physiological process- load are terms used to characterise foods and diets based on their effects on bloodglucose levels. Also see box 4.1.3 in chapter 4.1. Cereals (grains) and products made from them (such as breads, pastas, and breakfast cereals), as well as starchy roots and tubers, ar eall high in carbohydrates. These foods con - tain a mixtur eof complex and simple carbohydrates and other nutrients. Until recently, starches have been the main source of carbohydrate in human diets. With industrialisa-tion and urbanisation ,sugars have been added in increas- ing quantities in food preparation and as an ingredient in processed foods. Diets consumed in some high-income countries now may contain r oughly as much carbohydrate in the form of sugars as they do starches. Diets high in com- plex carbohydrates are usually associated with lower preva-lence of obesity ,heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. For summaries and judgements on dietary fibre, see chap- ter 4.1. For summaries and judgements on sugars, seechapter 4.6. For food processing, see chapter 4.9. 4.10.1.2 Fat Fats in diets ar emostly made up fr om triglycerides \u2014 thr ee fatty acid molecules attached to a glycerol backbone. Triglycerides are lipids, a class of organic compounds char-acterised by their solubility in or ganic solvents (such as ether 181CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS and chloroform); they are usually insoluble in water. The body stores excess energy as lipids in the form of body fat (also known as adipose tissue). Lipids also form part of the structural components of cellular membranes as well asbeing precursors of important hormones. Dietary fats include solid fats and liquid oils. Their phys- ical form at a particular temperature is determined by the chemical structure of their constituent fatty acids. Fats with ahigh proportion of 'saturated' fatty acids are solid or semi- solid at ambient temperatures; those with a higher amount of'unsaturated' fatty acids are more likely to be oils. The dif- ferent degrees of saturation produce various effects in the body. Diets high in saturated fatty acids (and also trans -fatty acids) (see chapter 4.5 and box 4.5.1) increase circulatingblood concentrations of cholesterol and the risk of cardio-vascular disease. The World Health Organization recom-mends limiting total fat to between 15 and 30 per cent of total daily energy intake and saturated fatty acids to less than 10 per cent. 1 Fats ar ethe most concentrated ener gy sour ce, supplying around 9 kcal per gram. They also carry the fat-soluble vit- amins (see chapter 4.10.2.1). The body can mak eall but two of the fatty acids it needs \u2014 linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, known as the 'essential' fatty acids. Both are found invegetables, nuts, and seeds and their oils, in varying quan-tities. They are also found in meat, eggs, and dairy products,but at lower levels. The long-chain fatty acids found in oilyfish (eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids) can bemade to a limited extent in the body ,wher ethey play a role in inflammation. 2These and related fatty acids are precur- sors to pr ostaglandins; these hormone-lik ecompounds have other diverse effects, including roles in blood vessel dilation and constriction, blood clotting, and transmission of nerveimpulses. Nuts, seeds, meat, oily fish, whole milk and dairy prod- ucts, cooking oils and fats, spreadable fats, and a wide rangeof manufactured foods all contain varying amounts and typesof fats. Those from animal sources usually have a higher pro-portion of saturated fatty acids, and these ar ecommon in processed foods. For summaries and judgements on fats and oils as foods, see chapter 4.5. For summaries and judgements on foods that are or may be high in fats, see chapters 4.3 and 4.4. 4.10.1.3 Proteins Proteins ar elarge organic molecules made up of amino acids arranged in a chain .Short chains ar ecalled peptides, for instance di- and tripeptides (made up of two and three amino acids respectively). Longer chains are known asoligopeptides, and long chains as polypeptides. Pr oteins ar e fundamental structural and functional elements within every cell in the body. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reac- tions and are vital to metabolism. Others have structural or mechanical functions, such as the pr oteins in the cytoskele- ton,which give cells their shape and str ength. They ar ealso important in cell signalling, immune responses, cell adhe- sion, and the cell cycle. Proteins supply ar ound 4 kcal per gram. They ar edigest-ed into their constituent amino acids, which are then absorbed into the blood. The body has the ability to make some amino acids, but others, so called essential amino acids, must be obtained from foods and drinks. Dietary sources of protein include meats, milk and cheese, pulses (legumes), nuts, and cereals (grains) and products made from them, such as breads. Animal proteins from eggs, milk, and meat contain all the essential amino acids in the proportions needed by humans; soya protein isthe only plant food to do so. Other plant protein sources have differing proportions of various essential amino acids, so diets without animal foods or soya need to include a vari- ety of plant protein sources to provide enough of the essen- tial amino acids. For summaries and judgements on foods that contain proteins, see chapters 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4. 4.10.2 Micronutrients Micronutrients are essential constituents of diets needed in small quantities compar ed with macr onutrients, and ar enot sources of energy. These are vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Deficiency of any dietary constituents classified asamicronutrient causes debility, disease, and eventually death. Many processed foods are 'fortified' with synthetic vita- mins and minerals (bo x4.10.1). Others contain various microconstituents such as phytochemicals, and sometimes other ingredients such as bacteria and 'prebiotic' polysac- charides; these pr oducts ar esometimes termed 'functional foods' (box 4.10.2). Both types of product are often marketed with health claims relating to these added constituents or tothe whole food. 4.10.2.1 Vitamins Vitamins are organic molecules, classed as fat- or water- soluble, that are needed for metabolism but cannot be madein the body and so must be supplied in the diet. They havediffer ent specific functions in the body .For example, vitamin Kis needed for blood clotting and vitamin C for the pr o- duction of collagen in connective tissue. Vitamins A (retinol), D, E, and K are fat-soluble and can only be digested, absorbed, and transported in conjunction with dietary fats. So they are found mainly in fatty foods such as liver and oily fish, milk and dair yproducts, animal fats (such as butter), and vegetable oils. The main sour ces of vitamin A are plant foods containing the retinol precur- sors known as carotenoids, which are converted by the bodyto retinol (see bo x4.2.1 in chapter 4.2). Pr eformed r etinol, which is absorbed better than carotenes in plant foods, is found only in animal products, of which liver is a particu-larly rich source. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the liver and in body fat stores. For this reason, they do not need to be consumed ever yday. For the same reason, some are toxic in high doses. Vitamin C and the B vitamins are water-soluble. The B group includes thiamin (vitamin folate, and cobalamin (vitamin B12). Excess amounts of water-soluble vitamins are generally not toxic because theyare excreted in the urine rather than stored in the body. Thisalso means that they generally have to be consumed morefrequently than fat-soluble vitamins. Plant foods are impor-tant sour ces of water-soluble vitamins: for example, cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, some r oots and tubers, and puls - es (legumes). They can be destroyed by heat or exposure to the air ,or lost by leaching during cooking, for instance when vegetables are boiled (see chapter 4.9.4). 4.10.2.2 Minerals, trace elements Minerals are inorganic substances. Most foods contain sig- nificant amounts of one or more minerals, and these com-pounds have many specific functions in the body. Some areessential components of enzymes and other proteins (as'cofactors', such as ir on). They are also involved in main- taining normal cell function (sodium, potassium, calcium),and for structur e(calcium in bones and teeth). Others include magnesium, phosphorus, and sulphur. Trace elements are minerals needed by the body in very small amounts. Whether a mineral is defined as a trace ele - ment is somewhat arbitrary: iron, zinc, and copper are min- erals that may or may not be identified as trace elements.Others include iodine, selenium, chr omium, Phytochemicals Phytochemicals are bioactive constituents of plant foods not identified as nutrients because they are not essential in the sense of being vital to life itself .Unlike vitamins and miner- als, people do not suffer diseases when their diets ar elow in phytochemicals. However, consuming them may have ben- eficial effects on health or active roles in the prevention ofdiseases. Also see bo x4.2.2 in chapter 4.2. Various phytochemicals have been shown to have anti - oxidant, anti-car cinogenic, anti-inflammatory, immunomod- ulatory, and antimicrobial effects in laboratory experiments. But it is not yet clear whether consuming these compoundsproduces these or other effects in the body. Phytochemicals have various chemical structures and are grouped into families on this basis. They include and teas ar ehigh in phytochemicals. 4.10.4 Supplements Vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and other bioactive sub- stances are available as supplements, usually in pill or pow- der form. These began to be manufactur ed and marketed after their functions wer eidentified, and claims made for their general benefits in prevention of disease and promo- tion of well-being. Many dietar ysupplements ar eclassed as foods, although Functional foods ar eso-called because they ar ebelieved or claimed to have special qualities, such as pr omoting well-being or protecting against disease. What marks them out from 'nor- mal' foods is that they ar especifically for mulated, manufactured, and marketed as being 'functional' in specified ways, for which claims ar emade. Some for tified pr oducts, such as breakfast cere- als and yoghurts, are positioned as functional foods. The ingredients in functional foods claimed to have special qualities may be added fractions of macronutrients, such asamino acids or fatty acids, or vitamins, minerals, or trace ele - ments. Very often the 'functional' ingredients will be known or claimed to be bioactive in other ways: these include phyto-chemicals, herbal extracts, and commensal bacteria. Box 4.10.2 Functional foodsFood 'fortification' refers to the addition of nutrients, often in synthetic form, to foods, so that the food contains more of the nutri- ents added. The term 'enrichment' is some-times also used. The United Nations and other interna- tional organisations are responsible for major food fortification programmes, designed in particular to reduce rates ofdeficiency of vitamin A, iodine, iron, and other nutrients, mostly within low-income countries. But common foods have beenfortified in many countries since the early 20th century. For example, in some coun- tries margarine and other fat spreads, ormilk, have been fortified with vitamins A and D. White flour, and therefore white bread and other products made from it, iscommonly fortified with some B vitamins, and also sometimes with calcium and iron. The term 'fortification' in these and other examples may refer to the partialreplacement of nutrients otherwise absent or depleted by food-processing methods. Or it may refer to the addition of nutrients to levels not found in the food in whole form; for example, the addition of calciumto white bread in the UK is to levels high- er than those found in wholegrain breads; and salt may not contain iodine. Many common processed foods and drinks, including some that would other- wise be low in nutrients, are now fortifiedwith various combinations of synthetic nutrients. These include breakfast cereals, biscuits (cookies) and other baked goods,dried milk, milk-based products, and soft drinks, and even confectionery. Many such products are designed to be consumed by children. In an increasing number of countries, the nutrients consumed in fortified foods and drinks amount to a substantial and growing proportion of total consumption of these nutrients. For example, since 1998in the USA, grain has been fortified with folic acid, the synthetic equivalent of folate, as a public health measure designedto reduce the incidence of neural tube defects in the fetus. As a result, it is esti- mated that over one third of all intake ofthis nutrient in the USA comes from this source, as well as from fortified breakfast cereals. 3Box 4.10.1 Food fortification183CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS some may be r egulated medicinal products. Manufacturers of food supplements may mark et their pr oducts using health claims, although in some countries such as the UK, medici- nal claims that the pr oduct can pr event, cur e, or tr eat a dis- ease may not be made. Herbal products may be permitted to make certain claims based on their history of being usedfor a particular condition .The r egulator ystatus of dietar y supplements varies from country to country. Some nutrients such as water-soluble vitamins have been thought to be harmless at pharmacological doses; but there isnow evidence, including some summarised and judged in thisReport, that this is not always the case. Other nutrients, includ- ing fat-soluble vitamins and all minerals and trace elements,areknown to be to xic at pharmacological doses; some of these, selenium being one example, are known to be toxic at rela- tively low pharmacological levels (also see box 4.10.3). Expert r eports issued by United Nations agencies and national governments specify levels of nutrients agreed to protect against deficiency diseases, and also (sometimes) agreed to be safe in use. Many people take dietary supplements. Their use is high- er in high-income countries. In the UK, 35 per cent of respon-dents r eported taking dietar ysupplements. Ar ound 50 per cent of people in the USA take supplements in some form. 4.10.5 Interpretation of the evidence 4.10.5.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2,3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' (RR) is used in this Report to denote ratio measures of effect, including These specific points apply only to trials using micronutri- ent supplements. Measurement . The results of supplement trials can be assumed only to apply to levels and forms of the micro- nutrient present in the supplement. Study design .Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using nutrient supplements provide strong evidence. But the evi-dence can only be taken to apply to supplements at the dosesand in the form given, under the specific experimental con-ditions. The doses used in trials are often pharmacological, in which case they cannot be taken as directly relevant to the nutrients as contained in foods and diets. Supplementsin synthetic forms ar esometimes but not always chemical - ly identical to the nutrient as found in food, and so may have differ ent biochemical effects. This may also be because of the level of the dose, because the nutrient is given in isolation or separated from the nutritional matrix as found in foods,or for other reasons. Confounding .In trials using supplements given in combi- nations, it is not possible to attribute any effect to an indi - vidual nutrient. 4.10.6 Evidence and judgements The full systematic literatur ereview (SLR) is contained on the CD included with this Report. 4.10.6.1 Carbohydrates For the evidence on foods containing carbohydrate, includ- ing dietar yfibre, see chapter 4.1. For the evidence on sugars as a food, see chapter 4.6. 4.10.6.2 Fats For the evidence on foods containing substantial amounts of fats and oils, see chapters 4.3 and 4.4. F or the evidence on fats and oils as foods, see chapter 4.5. 4.10.6.3 Pr oteins The evidence from the SLRs did not suggest that proteins specifically modify the risk of cancers of any sites. For theevidence on foods containing pr otein ,see chapters 4.1, 4.3, and 4.4. 4.10.6.4 Vitamin supplements The evidence presented here is derived from studies of vit- amins and beta-car otene (a vitamin A precursor) in supple- ment form only .Microconstituents in supplement form may have very different effects according to form, dosage, com- bination with other nutrients, interaction with diets as awhole, and other factors. The effects of bioactive substances vary with the quantities con- sumed. The amounts of nutrients and other substances in diets depend on the nature and quantity of the foods and drinks that taken together make up diets. The amounts of nutrients and other substances contained in dietary supplements, in this context usually referred to as doses, may or may not be at levels that can be found in diets. Lower amounts, at levels about the same as those that can be found in diets, are known as 'physiological doses'. Higher amounts, atlevels above any that can be found in diets, are known as 'phar- macological doses', or sometimes as 'mega-doses'. Evidence from trials and studies using supplements are often difficult to compare. One reason for this is that both human and animal studies use supplements in different combinations and concentrations. A nutrient that has one effect at a relatively lowor physiological dose may have a different effect at a higher or pharmacological dose. For instance, a nutrient that may evi- dently be protective at a lower or physiological dose may betoxic or pathogenic at a higher dose. Randomised controlled trials using various doses of micro- nutrients have produced evidence of the effects of thesesupplements in modification of the risk of cancers of some sites.This evidence is summarised and judged in chapter 4.10.6. Box 4.10.3 Levels of supplementation 184PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 4.10.6.4.1 Retinol Skin Two RCTs investigated retinol supplements and skin cancer (table 4.10.1).45 Both trials included only participants at risk of develop- ing non-melanoma skin cancer. The retinoid skin cancer pre- vention (actinic keratoses) trial (SKICAP-AK) included with precancerous lesions (actinin ker- atoses); the retinoid trial (SKICAP-S/B) includ- edpeople with of non-melanoma skin cancer. SKI- CAP-AK showed non-significant increased risk for basal cell carcinoma, with an effect estimate of 1.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-1.43), but it did show a statistically sig-nificant decreased risk for squamous cell carcinoma 0.68(95% CI 0.51-0.92), comparing intervention to placebo. 5 SKICAP-S/B produced no evidence of effect for either basal cell carcinoma (106 cases intervention group: 110 cases placebo group) or squamous cell carcinoma (41 cases eachin inter vention and placebo gr oup). 4 Meta-analysis was possible on both trials, giving summary effect estimates of 1.10 (95% CI 0.90-1.34) for basal cell car - cinoma and 0.93 (95% CI 0.70-1.23) for squamous cell carcinoma. The mechanism of anti-tumour action of the retinoids is not completely known but retinol is known to bind to cellreceptors with promotion of differentiation, alteration ofmembranes, and immunological adjuvant effects. 6 The evidence is sparse and studies were conducted on anarrowly defined population gr oup (people at risk of developing skin cancer). There is limited evidence suggesting that retinol supplements protect againstsquamous cell skin cancer . The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-control study7has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). Lung Two trials (one an R CT , the other a non-randomised trial),8-11 two case-control studies14 15 investigated retinol or vitamin A supplements and lung cancer (table 4.10.2).The single RCT was the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) trial (table 4.10.2) among current and former smokers (some of whom were asbestos workers) who were given retinyl palmitate and beta-carotene, orplacebo. It showed statistically significant increased risk of all lung cancers in the treated subjects, with an effect esti- mate of 1.28 (95% CI 1.04-1.57). The risk of death from lung cancers was 1.46 (95% CI 1.07-2.00). 9The risk was especially elevated in those who had the intervention as wellas exposure to either asbestos or heavy smoking, although neither subgroup analysis was statistically significant. At follow-up (5 years after trial termination), the effect was reduced and no longer statistically significant, with an effect estimate of 1.12 (95% CI 0.97-1.31). 8 The other trial, which was not randomised, gave retinol or beta-carotene to asbestos-exposed people and used amatched comparison group, giving an adjusted effect esti- mate of 0.67 (95% CI 0.33-1.37). 11 One cohort study was stratified according to smoking sta- tus (curr ent, former ,and never).12In curr ent smok ers, high- dose vitamin A supplements (synthetic beta-carotene or retinol) wer eassociated with an incr eased risk, with an effect estimate of 3.42 (with no CI or value for trend reported), when compared to no supplements. Men who never smokedshowed a non-significant decreased risk. 12The other cohort study showed no effect on risk for men and non-significantdecreased risk in women. Effect estimates were 1.0 (95% CI0.66-1.51) for men and 0.65 (95% CI 0.39-1.06) forwomen ,when comparing supplement use to non-use. 13One case-control study showed a non-significant increased riskwith supplement use, 14the other showed no effect on risk.15 It is possible that the potential protective associations pre- sent at dietary intake amounts of vitamins are lost orreversed by pharmacological supplementation and the high - er levels that this may supply. The evidence is sparse and inconsistent.

Four studies showed increased risk with a beta-carotene intervention,1617 19 20which was statistically significant in two (during the trial, not at follow-up; smokers).8-10 16 17One study showed a non-significant decreased risk.18Meta- analysis was possible on three trials, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.10 (95% CI 0.89-1.36) for beta-carotene sup- plementation versus none, with moderate heterogeneity (fig-ure 4.10.1). Two trials could not be included in themeta-analysis. One trial reported an effect estimate of 1.50(95% CI 0.43-5.28) for those taking beta-carotene compared to those taking retinol from a total of 10 lung cancers in all participants. 20The other RCT was the CARET trial (table 4.10.3) among curr ent and former smok ers (some of whom were asbestos workers) who were given retinyl palmitate and beta-car otene, or placebo .It showed statistically significant increased risk of all lung cancers in the treated subjects, with an effect estimate of 1.28 (95% CI 1.04-1.57). The risk ofdeath from lung cancers was 1.46 (95% CI 1.07-2.00). 9The risk was especially elevated in those who had the interven-tion as well as exposure to either asbestos or heavy smok-ing, although neither subgr oup analysis was statisticallysignificant. At follow-up (five years after trial termination), the effect was reduced and no longer statistically significant,with an effect estimate of 1.12 (95% CI 0.97-1.31). 8 One cohort study showed non-significant increased risk for beta-car otene supplementation compar ed to none in women . The other study showed non-significant decreased risk in men. Effect estimates were 1.23 (95% CI 0.55-2.76;women) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.36-1.85; men). 21 There is a marked interaction between beta-carotene, heavy smoking and genotype.22 23When beta-carotene ferase variant GSTM1 who smok ed mor ethan 42 cigarettes per day was compared to beta-carotene supplementation among those without GSTM1 who smok ed less than 37 cig - arettes per day, a RR of 6.01 (95% CI 1.90-19.08) was observed.22After adjusting for age and smoking habits, an RR of 3 (95% CI 1.3-7.1) was obser ved for the Ar g/Arg genotype when 545 \u00b5g/l of serum beta-carotene was com- pared to 45 \u00b5g g/l.23Glutathione- Stransferase 1 and 2 are carcinogen-detoxifying enzymes. People without or with lessactive forms of these enzymes, due to genetic variation, areless able to metabolise to xins than others and have higher risk of cancer ,particularly if they ar esmokers or exposed to regular doses of to xins through another source. It is possible that the protective association present at dietary intake amounts of carotenoids is lost or reversed bypharmacological supplementation and the higher levels that this may supply. In one animal study, low-dose beta-carotene was pr otective against smoking-induced changes in p53, while high doses pr omoted these changes. 24Asecond expla - nation could be the complex nature of naturally occurring carotenoids and the possibility that the protective associa-tions ar enot due to the specific agent used in supplement studies, but rather to other carotenoids present in dietary exposure 25or other associated dietary or health related behaviours. Thereis strong evidence from good quality trials, consistent with cohort studies. An interaction betweensmoking, genetics, and beta-carotene is apparent. Theevidence that beta-carotene supplements cause lungcancer in curr ent smok ers is convincing.

Three RCTs910 16 18 26and two cohort studies27 28investigated beta-carotene supplements (table 4.10.4). Two for beta- carotene supplementation compar ed to none910 16;the other showed effect on risk.18Effect estimates were 1.26 (95% CI 0.98-1.62) for the 1985 to 1993 follow-up period,161.01 (95% CI 0.80-1.27),910and 1.0 (95% CI 0.9-1.1).18 One a non-significant increased risk for beta-car otene supplementation compar ed to none27; the other stated that there was no significant association.28 The single reported effect estimate was 1.17 (95% CI 0.85-1.61).27 There is no evidence for any mechanism of action. Thereis str ong evidence from good quality trials, and from cohort studies, which consistently fails to demonstrate a protective effect. Beta-carotene supplements are unlikely to have a substantialprotective effect against prostate cancer. The evidence is too limited to draw a conclusion on a harmful effect. Skin See also chapter 4.2.5.3 for evidence on foods containing beta-carotene.

It is unlikely thatbeta-carotene has a substantial effect on the risk ofnon-melanoma skin cancer. 4.10.6.4.3 Alpha-tocopherol Prostate One RCT investigated alpha-tocopherol supplements and prostate cancer (table 4.10.6).16 26 The ATBC (Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene) trial was a large RCT of male smokers given 50 mg of alpha-tocopheroland 20 mg of beta-car otene (see table 4.10.6 for details). It showed a statistically significant decreased risk for alpha-toco- pherol supplements, with an effect estimate of 0.66 (95% CI 0.52-0.86) for use compared to non-use. Prostate cancer was not a prior-stated outcome for this trial. 1626 Data on dietary, serum, or supplemental vitamin E or alpha-tocopherol levels were suggestive of decreased risk,though generally not statistically significant. Data ongamma-tocopher olprovided evidence of an association with decreased risk. Vitamin E exists in eight different forms or isomers: four tocopher ols and four tocotrienols. Ther eis an alpha, beta, gamma, and delta form of each. Each form has slightly dif- ferent biological properties but all are antioxidants. Alpha-tocopher ol is thought to be the most biologically active isomer of vitamin E. It inhibits proliferation, can directly acti- vate certain enzymes, and exerts transcriptional control onseveral genes. 34Vitamin E has also been shown to inhibit the growth of human prostate tumours induced in mice.35 Theevidence is sparse. Ther eis limited evidence that alpha-tocopher ol supplements pr otect against prostate cancer in smokers.4.10.6.4.4 Calcium Colorectum Seven cohort studies investigated calcium supplements and colorectal cancer.36-43Three trials44-49and four cohort studies50-53investigated calcium supplements and colorectal adenomas. Six cohort studies showed decr eased risk for calcium sup- plements when compar ed none,36-41 43which significant in one.40One study showed non-significant increased risk.42The effect estimates can be seen in the for - est plot, apart from one study which reported an effect esti- mate of 0.76 (95% CI 0.56-0.98) for the highest intakegroup compar ed to the lowest (figur e4.10.3). 43 Pooled analysis from 10 cohort studies (with over 534 000 participants followed up for 6 to 16 years, 4992 cases of col-orectal cancer) presented results for calcium from foodsources and total calcium which includes supplements. Alarger effect was seen for total calcium (0.78, 95% CI 0.69-0.88) than for calcium fr om food sour ces (0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.95). 54 Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. Adenomas Two R CTs showed decreased risk of adenomas with calcium supplementation ,44-48which was statistically significant in one.44-47Effect ecurr ence).48 One additional trial showed a reduced risk of new ade- noma growth during a 3-year intervention of a daily mix-ture of beta-carotene 15 mg, vitamin C 150 mg, vitamin E 75 mg, selenium 101 \u00b5g, and calcium (1.6 g daily) as car- bonate (p value 0.035), though with no statistically signifi - cant effect on the gr owth of pr e-existing adenomas. 49 Three cohort studies showed decreased risk with calcium supplementation,50-52which was statistically significant for one.50One study r eported no significant association .53Meta- Table 4.10.6 Alpha-tocopher ol supplements and prostate cancer; trials Trial Number of Intervention Length of Length of name participants intervention follow-up ATBC Study 29 133 20 mg of beta- 5-8 years 6-8 years (male carotene only or smokers) with 50 mg of Virtamo 2003 alpha-tocopherolHeinonen 1998 Figure 4.10.3 Calcium supplements and 0.70 0.60 2003 Women 0.73 (0.30-1.76) Feskanich 2004 Women 0.87 (0.69-1.11) Lin 2005 Women 1.30 (0.90-1.87) Relative risk (95% CI) Relative risk, highest vs lowest exposure category15 0.2 2 0.5188PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS analysis was possible on two of these studies, giving a sum- mary effect estimate of 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.98) per 200 mg/day.5052The other study that gave quantified results reported an effect of 0.76 (95% CI 0.42-1.38).51 Calcium is an import micronutrient and intracellular calcium is a pervasive second messenger acting on many cellular functions, including cell growth. It has been widely demonstrated that calcium has direct growth-restraining, and differentiation- and apoptosis-inducing action, on normaland tumour colorectal cells. 55 There is generally consistent evidence from several cohort studies, and evidence from trials for colorectaladenomas. There is evidence for plausiblemechanisms. Calcium probably protects againstcolorectal cancer. 4.10.6.4.5 Selenium Prostate One R CT5657and two cohort studies2758investigated sele - nium supplements and prostate cancer (table 4.10.7). The R CT was conducted in men with a histor yof skin can - cers. Prostate cancer was not a prior stated outcome and was assessed as a secondary endpoint. Out of 974 participants,approximately half were randomised to receive 200 \u00b5g ofselenium daily. There were 13 cases of prostate cancer in the selenium group and 35 cases in the control group, giv-ing an effect estimate of 0.37 (95% CI 0.20-0.70) for sup - plement use compar ed to non-use, after a mean of 4.5 years of the intervention and a mean of 6.5 years follow-up. 56The effect was str ongest in those with the lowest levels of sele - nium at the start of the trial.57 Both cohort studies showed non-significant decreased risk with selenium supplementation .27 58Effect estimates wer e 0.94 (95% CI 0.57-1.55)27and 0.91 (95% CI 0.57-1.48)58 for use versus non-use. Dietary selenium data are supportive of an effect (see chapter 4.2.5.8). The general mechanisms thr ough which selenium could plausibly pr otect against cancer ar eoutlined below. In addi- tion,selenopr oteins are involved in testosterone production, which is an important regulator of both normal and abnor- mal prostate growth. There is strong evidence from trials and cohort studies. Selenium pr obably pr otects against prostate cancer.Lung One RCT investigated selenium supplements and lung can- cer (table 4.10.8).59 The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) Trial consist- ed of more than 1300 participants enrolled from several der- matology practices who were treated with 200 \u00b5g ofselenium. The trial showed a non-significant decr eased risk with supplementation, with an effect estimate of 0.74 (95% CI 0.44-1.24) after a mean of 4.5 years of the inter vention and a mean of 7.9 years follow-up, adjusted for age and smoking. Subgroup analysis indicated that this risk differedaccording to baseline plasma selenium level, with an effectestimate of 0.42 (95% CI 0.18-0.96) for those in the lowesttertile compared to no apparent effectiveness for individu-als in the higher tertiles of plasma selenium. 59This suggests that selenium supplementation may decr ease cancer risk in those who are deficient in dietary selenium, but that this effect may not extend to those whose intak eof selenium is within the recommended levels. The general mechanisms through which selenium could plausibly pr otect against cancer ar eoutlined below . The evidence is sparse. There is limited evidence suggesting that selenium protects against lung cancer. Skin One R CT60-62and one cohort study33investigated selenium supplements and skin cancer (table 4.10.9). The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial (see above) showed a non-statistically significant increased risk of totalnon-melanoma skin cancer with supplementation ,with an effect estimate of 1.18 (95% CI 0.49-2.85). Subgroup analy- sis showed an effect estimate of 1.14 (95% CI 0.93-1.39) for Table 4.10.7 Selenium supplements and prostate cancer; trials Trial Number of Intervention Length of Length of name participants intervention follow-up NPC Trial 974 men 200 \u00b5g Mean Mean Clark 1998 with a selenium 4.5 years 6.5 years Duffield- history of daily (primaryLillico 2003 non-melanoma endpoint was skin cancers skin cancer)Table 4.10.8 Selenium supplements and lung cancer; trials Trial Number of Intervention Length of Length of name participants intervention follow-up NPC Trial 1312 200 \u00b5g Mean Mean Reid 2002 people with selenium 4.5 years 7.9 years ahistory of daily (primary non-melanoma endpoint was skin cancers skin cancer) Table 4.10.9 Selenium supplements and skin cancer; trials Trial Number of Intervention Length of Length of name participants intervention follow-up NPC Trial 1312 200 \u00b5g Mean Mean Combs 1997 people with selenium 4.5 years 6.4 years Clark 1996 a history of daily (primaryDuffield- non-melanoma endpoint was Lillico 2002 skin cancers skin cancer)189CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS squamous cell carcinoma and 1.10 (95% CI 0.95-1.28) for basal cell carcinoma.61 The single cohort study stated that there was no statisti- cally significant association.33 The evidence is sparse and no plausible mechanisms have been identified. There is limited evidence suggesting that selenium supplements are a cause ofskin cancer. Colorectum One RCT60 62and one cohort study63investigated selenium supplements and colorectal cancer (table 4.10.10). The single trial included 1312 participants who were ran- domised to receive 200 \u00b5g selenium or a placebo. There were8colorectal cancer cases in the intervention group and 19 in the control group, giving an effect estimate of 0.36 (p value for trend 0.025) for use versus non-use. 60Ahazard ratio of 0.46 (95% CI 0.21-1.02) is given after a further 2.5years follow-up. 62 The single cohort study showed non-significant decreased risk, with an effect estimate of 0.60 (95% CI 0.27-1.32) for use versus non-use.63 Dietary selenium data are supportive of an effect (see chapter 4.2.5.8). The general mechanisms through which selenium could plausibly protect against cancer are outlined below. The evidence is sparse. Ther eislimited evidence to suggest that selenium protects against colorectalcancer . General mechanisms Dietar yselenium deficiency has been shown to cause a lack of selenoprotein expression. Twenty-five selenoproteins have been identified in animals, and a number of these haveimportant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. 64 Four are glutathione peroxidises, which protect against oxidative damage to lipids, lipoproteins, and DNA. These enzymes ar erapidly degraded during selenium deprivation . Three ar ethioredoxin reductases and, amongst other func- tions, these regenerate oxidised ascorbic acid to its active antioxidant form. Selenopr oteins appear to reach their maximal levels relatively easily at normal dietary selenium intake and not to incr ease with selenium supplementation .It is,however, plausible that supraphysiological amounts of selenium might affect programmed cell death, DNA repair, carcinogen metabolism, immune system, and anti-angio- genic effects.65 4.10.7 Comparison with previous report This Report associates nutrients and dietary constituents with foods and drinks wherever possible; and findings and judgements on these as contained in foods and drinks are found in previous sections of this chapter. The previous report included a whole chapter on dietary constituents. It found that starch (probably when it is the staple of povertydiets) possibly protected against colorectal cancer but waspossibly a cause of stomach cancer. The evidence from theSLRs undertaken for this Report did not reproduce these findings. The previous report noted that trials using supplements of various micr onutrients such as beta-car otene, vitamin E, and multiple vitamins and minerals had produced mixed results. But it did not mak eformal judgements as a r esult of these trials, although one of the report's recommendations was that dietary supplements are probably unnecessary, and pos-sibly unhelpful, for reducing cancer risk. RCTs publishedsince the mid-1990s have strengthened the evidence on therelationship of some dietary supplements and the risk of can-cers of some sites. For comparisons with the pr evious report concerning dietary constituents here identified as foods (such as sugars, fats and oils, and alcohol) or foods which contain certain constituents (such as dietary fibre, vitamins, minerals, and trace elements), see chapters 4.1 to 4.8. 4.10.8 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The evidence that the use of high-dose beta-car otene supplements in tobacco smok ers is a cause of lung cancer is convincing. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting that high- dose retinol supplements are a cause of lung cancer in this group. The principal cause of lung cancer is smokingtobacco . Calcium probably protects against colorectal cancer. At specific doses, selenium pr obably pr otects against prostate cancer . There is limited evidence suggesting that retinol at specific doses protects against squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.Thereis also limited evidence suggesting that alpha-toco - pherol protects against prostate cancer; and also that sele- nium at specific doses protects against colorectal cancer (atalevel of 200 \u00b5g/day, the dose used in the studies on which this judgement is based). Thereis limited evidence suggesting that selenium sup- plements ar eacause of skin cancer .It is unlik ely that beta- carotene supplements, or foods containing it, have a substantial effect on the risk of either prostate cancer or skin(non-melanoma) cancer .

Populations, communities, and families mayshare similar dietary patterns, which are determined byvarious factors such as the ecological niche they inhabit, physical environments in which they live, or by tradition, culture, religion, or choice. Dietary patterns, as well aspatterns of physical activity, have co-evolved with humansover millennia and are intimately related to long-termsurvival of the species within a given environment. Thechanges in environment including diets and activity patterns over the past century are likely to have affected the risk of chronic diseases, including cancer. Indeed, theimpact of food and nutrition on health is not generallydetermined by individual foods and drinks, specific dietaryconstituents, or the ways in which foods ar emodified, for example by processing or cooking. No food or drink is anelixir and few are poisons, unless they are contaminatedwith pathogenic micro-organisms. It is dietary patterns,with physical activity levels and other factors thatinfluence nutritional requirements, that determinenutritional status and other health outcomes that ar eof inter est to this R eport. Dietary patterns are difficult to characterise and are an infrequent subject for epidemiological and experimental investigations which, by their reductionist approach,typically address specific foods and dietary components.This pr ecisely focused appr oach may overlook the significance of diets as a whole. There is now increasinginterest in the examination of the impact of dietarypatterns on well-being and disease outcomes, includingthe risk of cancer. The P anel notes that existing studies of specific dietary patterns use differ ent definitions and that the evidence they have pr oduced is unclear .Currently, given the agreed criteria for grading evidence in this Report, no judgements can be made on any possible relationship between dietarypatterns, as defined in the literatur e, and the risk of cancer. For this reason, no matrix showing Panel judgements is included in this section. However ,a narrative summary pr ovides an analysis of existing evidence relating dietary patterns and cancer-related outcomes.For most populations at most times, food systems determine dietary patterns; traditionally, these systems have themselves been largely determined by climate and terrain. Until recent- ly in history, diets have been mostly made up from locallyavailable plant and animal sources, as gathered, hunted, reared, cultivated, preserved, processed, prepared, and con- sumed. The current dietary patterns of subsistence farmers around the world, in East Africa, Mexico, India, and China for instance, differ mostly not as a matter of communal orfamily choice, but because different staple crops flourish indifferent parts of the world. The same applies to communi-ties that live near rivers, lakes, and seas: their dietary pat- terns are different from those of inland populations largely because fish and seafood are available. Traditional diets inthe territories on or close to the Mediterranean littoral ar e typically high in vegetables, fruits, fish, and seafood. The dietar ypatterns of pastoralist populations, especially those living in Arctic climates, are high in meat and animal foods. The extreme example of imposed dietary patterns are'poverty' or 'deficiency' diets, consumed by impoverishedcommunities. One characteristic of human civilisation is food culture: the development of dietar ypatterns throughout or within soci- eties as part of general cultur e. It is thought that dietar ypat- terns have acquired a cultural dimension based on the fact that they have evolved with human populations pr oviding advantages for survival within a given ecological setting. Thus food cultures sometimes have become an expression ofsome system of belief . Dietetics, in its original form as a general philosophy of the well-led life, was developed in Greece and then later inwestern Europe (for example, by the School of Salerno, fromthe 12th century). Scholars and teachers of dietetics rec-ommended various dietar yregimes, which involved dietary patterns selected as a matter of choice. These wer eoften sim - ple or frugal, and not just for personal well-being and fr ee- dom from disease, but also as an expression of virtue. 1More recently, people began to adopt certain dietary patterns inthe belief that these could pr otect against disease. The urban-industrial food systems that generate the foods and drinks now pur chased and consumed by most people in the world ar echaracterised by the incr eased use of tech - nology in production, manufacture, processing, distribution, and sale. Another key feature is globalisation. Spices havebeen transported fr om Asia to Eur ope for thousands of years; sugar has been shipped around the world for half a millen- nium; similarly, the export of tropical fruits, meat, and teabecame subject to major intercontinental trade in the 19th century. Very many if not most foods, or their ingredients, now travel long distances befor ereaching their point of sale. Globalised food systems ar enow shaping dietar ypatterns in all continents. 23 This chapter summarises some of the dietary patterns that might modify the risk of cancer .Breastfeeding is also men -4.11 Dietary patterns191CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS tioned here in this context. For evidence and judgement on lactation, see Chapter 6; on being breastfed in relation to weight gain, overweight, and obesity, see Chapter 8. 4.11.1 Traditional and industrial dietary patterns Dietary patterns are determined by many factors. This first group includes some traditional and industrial dietary pat- terns, determined mainly by climate and terrain, material resources, technology, and culture. 4.11.1.1 Mediterranean The traditional food systems of the territories on or near the Mediterranean littoral, in southern-most Europe, the MiddleEast, and northern-most Africa, are the fount of a number of great cuisines. These were developed by peoples, often from the East, who settled in successive waves within whatis now Spain ,southern F rance and Italy ,former Y ugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, Crete, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Libya, Algeria, T unisia, and Mor occo.The Med - iterranean dietary patterns that have since evolved general- ly have some common aspects. Traditional Mediterranean diets are broadly characterised by high consumption of breads and other cereal foods usu-ally made from wheat, and of vegetables and fruits, fish,cheese, olive oil, tr ee nuts (almonds and walnuts), and (in non-Islamic countries) wine. Extensive use is made of many herbs and spices. Meat is also consumed, but often only onrelatively special occasions or in small amounts in combi - nation with other foods in everyday dishes. Coffee, drunk with added sugar (in modern times), is the traditional hotdrink. Desserts may also be sweet but overall consumptionof sugar is low. Since the second half of the 20th century, much attention has been given to the 'Mediterranean' diet. This interest isbecause of evidence associating the dietary patterns of thepopulations living in this r egion with low incidence of coro- naryheart disease. 4It is usually thought that this associa - tion is causal, and that the r easons include high consumption of fresh foods, dietary fibre, vegetables, fruits, and fish; mod- est consumption of alcoholic drinks; and low intakes of sat-urated fatty acids. In addition ,historically, habitual levels of physical activity have been high. Recommendations published since the early 1980s on food, nutrition ,and the pr evention of cancer have similari - ties with those for the prevention of coronary heart disease. Mediterranean dietary patterns might therefore also be pro-tective against cancer ,either generally or of specific sites. Traditional Mediterranean dietary patterns are gradually becoming less common as the food supplies of the countriesof the Mediterranean littoral become increasingly 'western' or 'globalised'. 4.11.1.2 Asian Traditional Asian cuisines are very diverse. But traditional Asian dietary patterns do have some qualities in common,certainly those of southern and eastern Asian countriesincluding India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, and Korea. Such traditional Asian dietary patterns are of low energy density. The staple cereal (grain) is usually rice, which is alsousually the main source of energy. Traditionally, rice paddy is often also used to breed fish. The amounts of vegetables, fruits, and fish in diets vary; consumption is relatively low in impoverished communities, and often high in those that are more prosperous. In the more affluent centres of civili-sation, traditional Indian and Chinese cuisines have been and often remain extremely diverse. But they are almost always made up mainly from foods of plant origin, again with very extensive use of herbs and spices. As in the Mediterranean region, large amounts of meat are usuallyreserved for special occasions. Japan is a maritime nation,and so the traditional dietary pattern is high in fish andseafood and in salt and salt-preserved foods. The maritime regions of other Asian countries have the same dietary pat- terns. Traditionally, most alcoholic drinks consumed in Asiaaremade fr om grains. Most foods ar ecooked at low tem- peratures (steaming, boiling), although some high-temper- aturemethods ar ealso used (stir -frying, deep-fr ying, roasting). Tea is the traditional hot drink in China, India, Sri Lanka, and Japan. Consumption of fat and sugars is tradi-tionally low. As with Mediterranean dietary patterns, and probably for broadly the same nutritional reasons, traditional southernand eastern Asian dietar ypatterns are associated with rela- tively low rates of obesity ,type 2 diabetes, cor onary heart disease, and some cancers. However, those that are high in salt ar eassociated with elevated rates of hypertension and stroke. Traditional Asian dietary patterns remain the norm in rural and impoverished regions of southern and easternAsia, but ar enow gradually becoming incr easingly ' western ' or 'globalised' in the urban and more prosperous parts of these countries. These generalisations do not apply to the countries of northern Asia, including those of the former USSR. 4.11.1.3 Plant-based Plant-based diets ar emainly but not necessarily solely made upfrom foods of plant origin. Characteristically, cereals (whole or minimally processed grains) and other starchyfoods, vegetables and fruits, pulses (legumes), herbs and spices, plant oils, and other foods and ingredients of plant origin ar ethe basis of almost all ever yday foods and meals. Meat, poultr y,fish, milk and dair yproducts, animal fats, and other foods and ingredients of animal origin are consumed, usually in small amounts on normal days, but often abun-dantly on special and feast days. Consumption of alcoholic drinks is also usually reserved for special social occasions. It is estimated that the dietary patterns of most of the world's population \u2014 perhaps around 4 billion people \u2014 are plant-based. Traditional Mediterranean and southern and eastern Asian dietar ypatterns (summarised above) are plant- based, as ar ethe dietar ypatterns of most rural communi - ties in middle- and low-income countries. Most populations that consume plant-based diets do not do so from choice, butbecause for them, animals ar evaluable and animal foods ar e192PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS relatively costly. In some traditions (see chapters 4.11.1.1 and 4.11.1.2), plant-based or vegetarian diets are consumed as an expression of philosophy of life or of religion. These cultures, teachings, or faiths often also include periodic peri-ods of fasting. The nutritional profiles of plant-based dietary patterns are very variable, depending largely on the degree of variety of the foods consumed, though their energy density is gener- ally low. Traditional plant-based cuisines from all over theworld combine cereals (grains) and other starchy foods with beans and other pulses (legumes) as the staple foods. When food supplies are secure they are generally adequate in ener- gy, and also in protein, unless reliant on very low-protein starchy staples such as cassava (manioc). Plant-based dietsmay be of relatively low energy density, but not necessarilyso. Most of the fatty acids in plant-based diets are unsatu-rated. Levels of vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and phy- tochemicals vary, again depending on the degree of variety in diets. Obesity ,type 2 diabetes, cor onaryheart disease, cancers of some sites, and other chronic diseases have been rare or uncommon in those parts of the world wher etraditional dietary patterns are plant-based. Such diets are now com- monly advocated and consumed by health-conscious peoplein high-income countries, partly on this basis. These diets arealso increasingly popular because of the epidemiological andother evidence that components of plant-based dietary pat-terns ar epotentially protective against various chronic dis- eases including some cancers. 4.11.1.4 'W ester n' The dietary patterns sometimes classified as 'western' have been generated by industrialised food systems, at first inwestern Eur ope, then in the US A.These patterns have also evolved in countries settled mostly by British and western European peoples, including those of the white populationsof South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and enclaves else-where in the world. This broad generalisation does not applyto some countries of Latin America, but in general r epresents the emer ging dominant pattern obser ved in urban centres of the region . 'Western' dietary patterns are energy dense, and are increasingly made up from processed foods. 5They are high in meat, milk and other dair yproducts, fatty or sugary foods such as processed meats, pastries, baked goods, confec- tioner y,sugared and often also alcoholic drinks, with vari- able amounts of vegetables and fruits. The star chy staple foods are usually breads, cereal products, or potatoes. A fea- ture of the global 'nutrition transition' with accelerating speed. 'Western' diets defined in this way are associated with overweight and obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular dis- ease, stroke, some cancers, and other chronic diseases. However ,the term 'western diet' is potentially confusing: variations of such diets consumed within ' western 'countries can and do have very different nutritional profiles. 4.11.2 Cultural dietary patterns These dietary patterns are strongly influenced by cultural factors. These include ethical and religious beliefs, andbeliefs about health. The distinction is somewhat arbitrary: these patterns are also influenced by climate and terrain, material resources, and technology. 4.11.2.1 Vegetarian and vegan diets Plant-based dietary patterns need not be vegetarian, except inaloose sense; but vegetarian diets are generally plant- based. The distinction is more one of attitude than nutri- tional profile. Typically, vegetarians are at least as concerned about the ethics and environmental effects of consuming(and producing) animal foods as they are with their ownwell-being and protection against disease. There are many types of vegetarian dietary patterns, and all exclude red meat and processed meat made from red meat. However, people whose intention is to be vegetarianmay occasionally eat these meats; and many if not most will consume some foods containing ingredients derived fromanimals that supply r ed meat, per haps inadvertently . Lacto-ovo vegetarians consume milk and dairy products and also eggs. Vegans consume no foods of animal origin,although some are stricter than others about what they eat.People who avoid red meats may consume poultry and fish,and are sometimes termed 'semi-vegetarian'. The dietarypractices of a number of r eligions or tarian are vegan. Rastafarians are semi-vegetarian. Zen macrobiotic food is mostly vegetarian ,although the main emphasis is on whole foods. For Seventh-day Adventists, see chapter 4.11.5.5. Taken together, vegetarian dietary patterns are heteroge- neous, as is the nutritional pr ofile of most types of vegetar - ian diets. Studies of some vegetarians have identified lower rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease, and all-causemortality. But people who are the subjects of such studies inhigh-income countries, who are vegetarian as a matter ofbelief or choice, ar efrequently of higher socioeconomic sta- tus compar ed with the general population .They are also less likely to smok eand more likely to be physically active (also see chapter 4.11.5.4). 4.11.2.2 Religious Seventh-day Adventists are a Christian denomination of about 14 million people who ,among other ways of life as part of their faith, ar esparing in their consumption of meat and meat products; about half are lacto-ovo vegetarians. Most avoid hot condiments and spices, tea and coffee, andalcoholic drinks. Smoking is pr oscribed. The effect of Seventh-day Adventist ways of life on well-being and health has been the subject of a large number of studies. Rates ofchronic diseases are generally lower among Adventists, and this is usually attributed to be their generally healthy ways of life. Several other r eligions enjoin their adher ents to r efrain from consumption of certain foods or beverages \u2014 for instance, Islam forbids consumption of pork and alcohol,Judaism pork and other foods, and Hinduism beef .193CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS 4.11.2.3 'Healthy' People who are conscious of the effects of food and nutri- tion on well-being, and on the risk of disease, may choose to consume 'healthy' diets. Such diets are featured in verymany popular television programmes, newspapers, maga- zines, and books. However, there are as many 'healthy' dietary patterns as there are concepts of what constitutes a healthy diet; and for many people a 'healthy' diet is seen as adiet regime designed to reduce excess body fat. In the USA, the 'Healthy Diet Indicator' 6and also the 'Healthy Eating Index' are used to assess how well people adhere to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 4.11.3 Other dietary patterns 4.11.3.1 Meal frequency One hypothesis about food, nutrition, and cancer is that risk may be modified by meal patterns. The times of day at whichfood is eaten var ygreatly in differ ent populations. Gatherer-hunters and pastoralists often consume most of their food once a day only ,or may not eat lar ge amounts of food every day. Settled agriculturalists may consume two meals at different times of the day, depending on their work. In urban settings, having three meals a day has been a common pattern. Some may be light meals and some moresubstantial, but the time of day at which each type is eatenvaries in differ ent parts of the world, and also within coun- tries. Some people choose to eat lighter meals or snacks mor e frequently throughout the day, rather than having three meals. A featur eof globalised food supplies and other aspects of modern cultures is the decline of the family meal; instead, anincreasing amount of food is eaten alone in the form of quick meals or snacks, in fast-food outlets, in the str eet, or at home. 4.11.3.2 Breastfeeding Being breastfed is a type of dietary pattern for infants. In fact it is the only pattern for healthy individuals based on a sin - gle food which pr ovides all known essential nutrients for a given period of life. F or a general summar yof lactation and breastfeeding, see chapter 6.3. For being breastfed, see Chapter 8. 4.11.4 Interpr etation of the evidence 4.11.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and bo xes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' (RR) is used in this Report to denote ratio measures of effect, including Classification .Amajor limitation with most studies of dietary patterns is that there is no general agreement on just whatconstitutes any dietar ypattern .For example, 'healthy' of diets are termed 'vege- tarian'; and there are various types of 'Mediterranean' diet. In general, there is considerable scope for variation within any dietary pattern. Confounding .Patterns of diet are interrelated with other habitual behaviour that may affect the risk of cancer, such as smoking or physical activity; people who habitually con- sume any type of diet for the sake of their health or for rea-sons of belief, may also modify other aspects of their way of life. This is likely to confound results that appear to show associations with the risk of cancer. Study design .The analysis of conventional epidemiological studies tends to focus on specific foods and drinks and spe-cific aspects of diets, rather than the overall pattern. Reporting bias .People who habitually consume or who try to follow types of diets in the belief that these are healthymay,in studies r elying on self -reporting, provide inaccurate records. They may overestimate their consumption of foods likevegetables, fruits, and other foods they believe to be healthy, and underestimate or fail to report consumption of foods and drinks they believe to be unhealthy. This type ofreporting bias is a general issue with studies relying on self-reporting, but may be a special issue here. Studies of specific dietary patterns undertaken by scientists who them-selves follow these patterns may be seen as biased for thisreason . 4.11.5 Evidence and judgements Epidemiological r esear ch concerned with food, nutrition ,and the risk of cancer, characteristically examines individual foods and dietary constituents. There is a growing body of epidemiological work on dietary patterns; these were within the terms of reference ofthe systematic literatur ereviews (SLRs) whose findings are the primar ybasis for the P anel judgements in this Report. However ,the evidence on dietar ypatterns examined in this way, relative to cancers of individual sites, does not permit conclusions to be drawn and the Panel decided not to make any judgements. Also see chapter 4.11.4.2. In the case of dietary patterns, evidence from the SLRs has been supplemented by an informal narrative literatur e review ,and the r esults ar esummarised her e. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 4.11.5.1 Mediterranean dietary patterns In a Swedish cohort study, a 2-point increase in a 'Mediterranean' diet score was associated with a 16% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1%-29%) reduced risk of cancer mortality in women aged 40-49, but not among youngerwomen . 7 An intervention trial investigated the recurrence of colo- rectal adenomas. This showed that the 'Mediterranean' diet(characterised by high consumption of vegetables, fruit, lean194PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS meat, fish, and olive oil) was associated with a reduced risk of recurrence of colorectal adenomas in women (RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.09-0.98), but not in men. 8 4.11.5.2 Asian dietary patterns AJapanese cohort study9showed significant associations between certain dietary patterns and the risk of stomach can- cer. These were for a 'traditional' Japanese dietary pattern in men (RR 2.88, 95% CI 1.76-4.72) and in women (RR2.40, 95% CI 1.76-4.72); and for a 'healthy' dietary pattern inwomen (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.96) but not in men. There was no association found with the 'western' dietary pattern. In the same Japanese cohort, 10'traditional' and 'western' dietary patterns were both positively associatedwith colon cancer risk in women, but not in men: 'traditional'RR 2.06 (95% CI 1.10-3.84) and 'western' RR 2.06 (95% CI1.10-4.45). The narrative review did not identify any other studies on Asian dietary patterns and the risk of cancer. For evidence and judgements on salt, salting, and salted food, and the risk of stomach cancer, see chapter 4.6 and chapter 7.5. 4.11.5.3 'Western' dietary patterns The narrative review identified several studies that have used data from large cohorts, mostly undertaken in the USA, toderive various types of 'western' dietary patterns fromdietar yintake information. This is done by combining key components of diets into what is then identified as types of dietary pattern that may be related to the risk of cancer risk.Some case-contr ol and ecological studies have also been car - ried out. Analysis of data from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study found no association between a ' western 'dietar ypat- tern and prostate cancer risk. In the study, this pattern was characterised as being high in refined cereals (grains), redand processed meats, fat, and sweets. 11Similarly, for breast cancer, another large cohort study reported no associationbetween a ' western' dietary pattern and breast cancer risk. 12 A'drink er'dietary pattern, characterised as being high in beer,wine, and spirits, was identified as being associated with a moderately increased risk of breast cancer (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.06-1.52). Acase-contr ol study from Uruguay reported an association with increased breast cancer risk and a 'western' diet; asso- ciations with decr and 'healthy 'dietar ypatterns.13Another case-contr ol study from Uruguay reported an association with increased stomach cancer risk and a 'starchy' pattern; associations withdecreased risk patterns. 14 ASwedish case-control study found that a diet high in meat, red meat, high-fat dairy products, high-fat gravy, andsweets was significantly associated with risk of gas- tric cardia adenocarcinoma and oesophageal adenocarcino- ma. a 'drink er' pattern (high intakes of beer,spirits/liquor ,and F rench fries) was significantly asso - ciated with the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus. 15 One of the first studies to investigate diet and cancer usingfactor analysis was a Japanese study looking at gallblad- der/biliary tract cancer mortality using data collected between 1958 and 1975.16Western-style diets high in foods with high levels of fats and proteins were associated withdecreased risk. For breast cancer mortality in Japan, anoth- er ecological study found that westernised diets high in both animal and saturated fats were associated with increased risk. 17 Another Japanese cohort study showed no association between a western dietary pattern and stomach cancer risk.9 For colon cancer risk in the same Japanese cohort, 'western' as well as 'traditional' dietary patterns were associated with increased colon cancer risk in women, RR 2.06 (95% CI 1.10-3.84) and RR 2.06 (95% CI 1.10-4.45) respectively,but not in men. 10 Three dietary patterns were identified from analysis of a Swedish cohort: 'healthy', including wholegrains, vegetables, fruits, tomatoes, poultry, and fish; 'western', including refined grains, fried potato, meat, processed meat, high-fatdairyproducts, mar garine/butter ,sweets and soft drinks; and 'drinker', including beer, wine, spirits, and snacks. The only pattern significantly associated with incr eased risk of renal cell carcinoma was the 'drinker' pattern (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.95). 18 Ananalysis of the Nurses' Health Study cohort also showed no evidence of an association between breast can-cer risk and either a 'prudent' or a 'western' dietary pattern. 19 Similarly ,no associations were reported between these dietar ypatterns and pancr eatic cancer in a US cohort study.20 Two 'western' dietary patterns were identified from a US cohort. These wer ea'prudent' type, characterised as being high in wholegrains, vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy prod- ucts, poultry, and fish; a characterised asbeing high in r efined cer eals (grains), r ed and pr ocessed meats, high-fat dairy products, sweets, and desserts. Neither was associated with overall breast cancer risk. However, the typical western pattern was associated with higher riskof breast cancer among smokers (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.02-2.03). 21 ACanadian case-contr ol study identified an association between pr ostate cancer risk and a 'pr ocessed' dietary pat- tern, characterised as being high in refined cereals (grains), white bread, onions and tomatoes, red meat, processed meat,organ meats, vegetable oil and juice, soft drinks, and bottled water. No significant associations were found with 'healthy living', 'traditional western ', or 'beverages' patterns. 22 Acase-contr ol study conducted in central Italy identified a'vitamin-rich' as well as a 'traditional' dietary pattern; both were strongly associated with decreased risk of stomachcancer . 23 For colon cancer, a case-control study reported a protec- tive effect of a 'prudent' western dietary pattern andincreased risk with a 'typical' western pattern. 24Another reported a protective effect of a western 'physical activity' pattern .25 Analysis of data fr om the F rench Eur opean Pr ospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort showed a significant association between two 'western'dietar ypatterns and incr eased risk of color ectal cancer. The195CHAPTER 4 FOODS AND DRINKS first, RR 1.39 (95% CI 1.00-1.94), included cereal products, potatoes, processed meat, eggs, cheese, butter, sweets, cakes, pizzas and pies, and sandwiches. The second was a 'drinker' pattern, RR 1.42 (95% CI 1.10-1.83), including processedmeat, alcoholic beverages, sandwiches, and snacks. A 'meat- eater' pattern, including meat, poultry, and margarine, was non-significantly associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer, RR 1.58 (95% CI 0.98-2.53). 26 In an Italian cohort study, four dietary patterns were iden- pattern was associated with lower risk of breast cancer, (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.95).27Another US cohort study reported no association between either a 'vegetable-fish/poultry-fruit' or a 'beef/pork-starch' patternand postmenopausal breast cancer. But it found a significantassociation with decreased risk of invasive breast cancer anda'traditional southern' pattern, including legumes, salad, and a low intake of mayonnaise salad dressing (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.95). 28 In the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer ,fac- tor analysis identified five types of western dietary patterns. Both the 'salad vegetables' and the 'sweet foods' patterns were associated with decreased risk of lung cancer: RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.55-1.01) and RR 0.62 (95% CI 0.43-0.89),respectively. The other three patterns were not significantlyassociated with lung cancer risk. These were 'pork, processedmeats, and potatoes', 'brown for white bread substitution',and 'cook ed vegetables'. 29 One study found that associations between dietar ypat- terns and colorectal cancer were not consistent across European countries. As part of the Dietar yPatterns and Cancer (DIETSCAN) project, factor analysis of three European cohorts identified five dietary patterns. Two ofthese, ' vegetables' and 'pork, pr ocessed meats, and potatoes', were common across all three cohorts. The second dietary pattern was associated with increased risk of colon cancerin one cohort of women (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.12-2.34), andwith increased risk of rectal cancer in one cohort of men (RR2.21, 95% CI 1.07-4.57). Neither pattern was associatedwith the risk of color ectal cancer in the third cohort. 30 For thyr oid cancer, a case-control study showed that var- ious western dietary patterns of 'fruits', 'raw vegetables', and 'mixed raw vegetables and fruits' were associated withreduced risk of thyroid cancer (RR 0.68, 0.71, and 0.73, respectively). However, a pattern of 'fish and cooked veg- etables' was associated with an incr eased risk (RR 2.79). 31 Another case-contr ol study showed that a 'dessert' pattern and a 'beef' pattern were associated with increased risk of kidney cancer. A 'juices' factor was associated with increasedrisk of this cancer in men and an 'unhealthy 'pattern with increased risk in women. 32 One case-control study from Uruguay reported an associ- ation with increased risk of oral and pharyngeal cancers and a'stew' pattern, characterised by cooked vegetables, potato and sweet potato ,and boiled meat. It also found a decreased risk of these cancers associated with a ' vegetables and fruits' pattern, characterised by raw vegetables, citrus fruits, other fruits, liver, fish, and desserts.33 Acase-contr ol study of pancr eatic cancer risk showed noassociation with 'western' and western 'drinker' patterns, but an association with decreased risk and a 'fruits and vegeta- bles' pattern.34 ACanadian case-control study found that four dietary pat- terns were associated with increased risk of kidney cancer: a'dessert' pattern in both men and women; a 'beef' pattern and a 'juices' pattern in men; and an 'unhealthy' pattern among women. 4.11.5.4 Vegetarian dietary patterns The narrative review identified several studies that have investigated the relationship between vegetarian diets and the risk of cancer. These often did not adjust for potentially confounding factors. One study found that when adjusted forage only, women who said they consumed vegetarian dietsseemed to increase the risk of breast cancer (1.65, 95% CI1.01-2.7) (vegetarian versus non-vegetarian). 35 Plausible biological mechanisms have been identified by which vegetarian diets might specifically reduce the risk ofcancers of the colon ,breast, and pr ostate (also see chapter 4.2). Any effect of vegetarian diets is likely to be due not only to the ex clusion of meat, but also to the inclusion of a lar g- er number and wider range of plant foods, containing an extensive variety of potential cancer-preventive substances. 4.11.5.5 Seventh-day Adventist diets The SLRs identified a of studies on the rela- tionship between Seventh-day Adventist diets \u2014 and alsogeneral ways of life \u2014 and the risk of cancer .Two investi- gated oesophageal cancer, 3637seven stomach cancer,37-43two kidney cancer ,37 42one br east cancer44and ee pr ostate can - cer.37 41 45For oesophageal, kidney, breast and prostate cancer, results were mixed and usually not statistically sig-nificant, although they wer eslightly suggestive of r educed risk. For stomach cancer, meta-analysis of five cohort studies 37-40 42gave a summary effect estimate of 0.60 (95% CI 0.44-0.80), with low heterogeneity, with non-included stud-ies also r eporting reduced risks. None of the studies that reported r educed risk was adjusted for known confounding factors such as smoking. As not smoking is a feature of Seventh-day Adventism, the Panel concluded that data on the dietary patterns associated with this faith ar elimited and no conclusion can be reached for any cancer site. No conclusions can be based on this evidence, because the data ar etoo limited and not comparable acr oss studies. 4.11.5.6 Meal frequency The SLRs identified 20 case-contr ol studies46-65that investi - gated irregular eating and stomach cancer. All but 1 report- ed increased risk estimates and 15 were statisticallysignificant. Meta-analysis of 16 case-control studies 50-65gave asummary effect estimate of 2.76 (95% CI 2.10-3.64) for irregular as opposed to regular eating (p < 0.001), but with high heter ogeneity . However, the reference period was generally some years before cancer diagnosis. Irregular eating can be taken tomean fr equent snacking or small meals, or missing main196PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS meals. But none of these studies defined 'irregular eating' or quantified the frequency with which meals might be skipped. Eight case-control studies investigated meal frequency and colorectal cancer.66-80Most showed increased risks with increased frequency of meals. Meta-analysis of 11 estimates from 7 of these studies67-69 76 78-80gave a summary effect esti- mate of 1.10 (95% CI 1.02-1.19), with high heterogeneity. This evidence is also unclear. No cohort studies have been identified as examining meal frequency. People who have stomach or colorectal problems are likely to eat irregularly. There is also high probability of confounding, as regular eat- ing patterns are associated with generally healthy behaviour. The significance of these findings on meal frequency and stomach and colorectal cancer is unclear, in part because ofthe high probability of confounding. For this reason, nojudgement is made. 4.11.5.7 Being breastfed The SLRs pr oduced no evidence on any r elationship between having been breastfed and the risk of cancer in adult life. However ,the reviews did pr oduce evidence on the r elation - ship between lactation and cancer in women, and also between having been breastfed and the risk of overweightand obesity in childhood and thereafter. See chapters 6.3.3and 8.8.3. 4.11.6 Comparison with pr evious r eport eport r eviewed evidence on vegetarian and mostly-vegetarian dietary patterns of various types, includ- ing Seventh-day Adventist and macrobiotic diets. The reportconcluded that various types of vegetarian dietar ypattern seem to decrease the incidence of cancer in general, as well as of some specific sites. It also concluded that semi-vege-tarian diets that include small amounts of meat and foodsof animal origin may also be beneficial. This conclusion wasnot made as a formal judgement. The pr evious r eport identified 'poverty' or 'deficiency' pat- terns of diet. These ar emonotonous, ver yhigh in refined cereal foods (such as rice), with only small amounts of other foods. This was partly in response to its finding that refinedcereals (grains) were a possible cause of oesophageal can- cer and that starch was a possible cause of stomach cancer. In explanation ,the panel r esponsible for that report con- cluded that any incr ease in the risk of cancer her ewas lik e- ly to be caused by poverty/deficiency dietary patterns, not by the specific food or dietary constituent. Thefirst r ecommendation of the pr evious r eport was in effect for: 'nutritionally adequate and varied diets, based pri- marily on foods of plant origin'. This was based partly on theevidently protective effects of vegetables and fruits, and also on the general balance of evidence. The panel emphasised that 'plant-based diets' do and may include r elatively mod- est amounts of foods of animal origin .4.11.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : Currently, no firm judgements can be made on any possiblerelationship between dietary patterns and the risk of cancer. 198PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Physical activity Physical activity is any form of movement using skeletal muscles. Until very recently in history, people necessarilyengaged in regular, moderate, and at least occasionalvigorous, physical activity. However, with urbanisation and industrialisation, general levels of physical activity have declined. Machines now do most of the work previouslydone by hand; driving and using public transport havelargely replaced walking and cycling. While people inhigher income countries and in urban settings in mostcountries may engage in some active forms of recreation,they remain largely inactive, and many spend much timein sedentary recreations, such as watching television andusing home computers. In general, the Panel judges that the evidence on physical activity and the risk of cancer ,which has continued to accumulate since the early 1990s, shows orsuggests that regular, sustained physical activity protectsagainst cancers of some sites. These include colon cancerand female hormone-related cancers, independently ofother factors such as body fatness. The P anel judges as follows .The evidence that physical activity protects against colon cancer is convincing.Physical activity probably protects against postmenopausalbreast cancer; the evidence suggesting that it protectsagainst premenopausal breast cancer is limited. Physicalactivity pr obably protects against cancer of the endometrium. The evidence suggesting that physicalactivity pr otects against cancers of the lung and pancr eas islimited. The Panel is impressed by the overall consistency of the evidence and concludes that r elatively high levels of physical activity protect, or may protect, against cancers of the colon, br east (postmenopause), and endometrium. T o prevent these cancers, the overall evidence supports the message that the more physically active people are the better; however, this excludes extreme levels of activity. The P anel also agr ees that since physical activity pr otects against overweight, weight gain, and obesity, it also protects against cancers for which the risk is increased by these factors (see Chapter 8). The evidence assembled for this Report gives an account of the beneficial effects of higher compar ed to lower levels of physical activity .However ,the P anel further agr eesthat the evidence can equally be interpreted as showing thatsedentary ways of life increase or may increase the risk ofthese cancers. Most people in urbanised, industrialised,CHAPTER 5 and mechanised settings throughout the world now lead these sedentary ways of life. Finally, the Panel agrees that the evidence assembled and judged in this chapter supports the general hypothesis that people have evolved and adapted to be physically active throughout life. The Panel also agrees ,therefore, that sedentary ways of life ar eunhealthy .Itisaware of current trends and also projections (summarised in Chapter 1) showing that average physical activity levels ar e continuing to decrease throughout the world. Within the remit of this Report, the strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of 'convincing' and'probable', shows that physical activity of all types protectsagainst cancers of the colon, and also of the breast(postmenopause) and endometrium. This chapter does not addr ess the social or environmental (or underlying and basic) determinants ofphysical activity and its general decline; this is the subjectof an associated report to be published in late 2008.199CHAPTER 5 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Since the emergence of Homo sapiens around 250 000 years ago, and until very recently in history, people have usuallybeen regularly physically active from early childhoodthroughout life unless prevented by disability or infirmity.Gather er-hunter (and pastoral) and peasant-agricultural communities have to be physically active to sustain theirways of life. This includes building and maintaining dwellings; raising families; seeking food security and feed- ing infants, dependants, the disabled, and elders; and trav-elling to find water ,game, precious items, and better land. Walking, as well as activities undertaken with hand tools such as gathering, hunting, gr owing, har vesting, grinding, cooking, cleaning, building, and fighting, all r equir earegu- lar and substantial amount of energy from food. Throughout history, manual workers in and around cities have also been physically active, by the natur eof their occu - pations. These range from those who built pyramids in Egypt, Mexico, and elsewhere, and fortifications in Asia,Latin America, and Europe, to the working-class labourers of industrialised countries. Such labourers built houses, sewers, bridges, canals, railways, r oads, served in armies and navies, and work ed in mines and factories, 'by the sweat of their brow', and still do so, throughout the world. In modern times, the story of urbanisation and of indus- trialisation is one in which machines ar eincreasingly usedto do the work previously done by hand. Early factory and farm machinery still involved sustained, moderate or vigor- ous physical activity, as did housework; and most people walked or (later) cycled to work. In the first half of the 20thcentury, most occupations in high-income countries required physical activity and only a minority of households owned cars or televisions. In middle- and low-income countries at that time, almost all occupations were physically active. In the second half of the 20th century this all began to change, at first gradually and then more rapidly. Now, at thebeginning of the 21st century, most occupations in urbanareas throughout the world are sedentary. Household tasks are mostly mechanised; much food is purchased already pre- pared; most journeys (even short ones) are made by car orpublic transport; and for young people, television viewing and the use of computers have often largely replaced activerecreation . In public health terms, given the known benefits of regu- lar, sustained physical activity, this shift in whole populationsfrom being active to sedentary is one of the most ominousphenomena of recent decades. This is not confined to high-income countries or urban areas. The ways of life of mostpeople in most countries ar enow sedentary, with the major exception of peasant farmers and manual labour ers, mostly in Asia and Africa but also elsewhere. General levels of physical activity in high-income coun - tries, and more recently in most other countries, have dropped and continue to drop. It is in this special contextthat the P anel commissioned systematic literatur ereviews (SLRs) of the primary evidence on physical activity and cancer. 5.1 Definitions Physical activity is any movement using sk eletal muscles. F or people with sedentary ways of life, light physical activity includes standing, walking around an office or home, andshopping and food pr eparation. Recreation time may involve light, moderate, or vigorous physical activity depending on the natur eand intensity of activities, hobbies, and pursuits. Most people with active ways of life ar emoderately or vig - orously physically active at work (manual labour) or at home (household work by hand), and are moderately physicallyactive in transport (walking, riding, and cycling). P eople with sedentary occupations can be as physically active as people engaged in manual labour, but usually only if theyengage in regular moderate and occasional vigorous physi- cal activity away from work. 1 Sitting, standing, and other light physical activity intrin - sic to normal waking life, such as str etching, fidgeting, and maintaining posture, are all forms of physical activity. Exercise and other forms of physical training are types of recreational physical activity .These may be aerobic, such as PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND THE RISK OF CANCER Inthe judgement of the Panel, physical activity1modifies the risk of the following cancers. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence.

The Panel judges that the evidence is stronger for colon than for rectum. For an explanation of the ter ms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this chapter, and the glossar y. 200PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS running, cycling, dancing, and other activities that increase oxygen uptake and improve cardiovascular function, among other things; or anaerobic, such as resistance training using weights, which increases muscle strength and mass.1 Physical activity increases energy expenditure and so is a factor in energy balance (see chapter 8.3.3). The intensity ofphysical activity can be categorised according to the degree to which it increases energy expenditure above basal metabolism. A table showing the intensity of physical activ-ity involved in different forms of movement is included in Chapter 12. 5.2 Types and levels of physical activity 5.2.1 Types of physical activity Conventionally, and for the purposes of this Report, overall physical activity is classified into four types. These are: Occupational (at work) Household (in the home) Transport (such as travelling to and from work) Recreational (leisur e). Much of the evidence summarised and judged below uses these classifications. They also highlight differences betweenvarious ways of life. Populations and communities wherephysical activity at work and at home depends on hand toolsand walking (or riding or cycling) ar eoverall physically active or ver yactive, even without r ecreational activity. Conversely, people whose ways of life at work and at home aresedentar y,and who use mechanised transport, will be overall sedentary, unless they engage in substantial amounts of moderate and perhaps some vigorous physical recreationalactivity away fr om work. In general, in high-income coun - tries recreational activity accounts for a greater proportion of an overall lower level of physical activity. 2 Physical activity can also be classified by intensity: vigor- ous, moderate, light, or sedentary (see boxes 5.1 and 5.2).Itis the combination of fr equency, intensity, and duration that determines total physical activity levels. A person mayuse the same total amount of ener gy in 1 hour of light phys -ical activity as they do in 30 minutes of moderate activity or 20 minutes of vigorous activity. 5.2.2 Levels of physical activity For many years, planners responsible for keeping specified population groups (such as builders, soldiers, schoolchild- ren, or office workers) healthy and productive have compiled estimates of the food or energy needed by these groups. Such estimates consistently show that some people need almostas much energy from food for physical activity as they do for the basic functions of vital organs and the assimilation of food. These are people who are moderately physically active for roughly half of their waking day, are engaged in light work or sitting or resting for most of the rest of theirwaking hours, and are occasionally vigorously physicallyactive. 4 In physically active populations where energy from food is not freely available, people tend to be lean, and also small. Below critical levels, as has been observed in Asia and inEurope, food scar city mak es regular, sustained physical work difficult and even impossible. 56 5.2.2.1 Energy costs of ways of life The energy requirements of healthy adults are determined largely by their habitual physical activity levels (PALs). PALsare the ratio of a person's daily total energy expenditure(TEE) to their basal energy expenditure, and thus take intoaccount the gr eater energy required for performing the same task with a higher body mass. 27 Asustained PAL of 1.2 corresponds roughly to a bedrid- den state. P eople whose occupations ar eexceptionally active, such as miners, woodcutters, soldiers, and athletes, may need more energy for physical activity than for their basicfunctions. This translates into habitual P ALs above 2.0. Such unusual people are mostly young adults, and these levels of physical activity are not sustained throughout life. PALsabove 2.4 can only be sustained over a long period of timeby unusually physically fit people. Also see Chapter 12. In general, in high-income countries in the first decade of the 21st centur y,average levels of physical activity usually account for about 20 to 30 per cent of TEE, but for extr eme- The total amount of energy a person uses during a particular activity is determined by a combination of the duration and intensity of the activity .Metabolic equiva- lents (METs) describe intensity relative to a person' sresting metabolic rate. The ener - gy costs of any particular activity vary, depending on a person's basal energyexpenditure and their age, sex, size, skill, and level of fitness. MET values take thesefactors into account. High total ener gy expenditur ecan be produced by performing low-intensity activity for a long duration or high-inten-sity activity for a shorter duration. However, these two different types of activity may have dif ferent physiological effects. The intensity of physical activity is therefore sometimes stratified into levels, such as vigor ous ( 6METs), moderate (3-5.9 METs), or light (<3 METs). METs can be used to describe the intensity of singleactivities, equivalent to the physical activ- ity ratio (PAR), or the overall level of activ-ity over a day, equivalent to the physical activity level (P AL). Vigorous physical activity can also be defined as that which increases heart andbreathing rates up to 80 per cent or more of their maximum (the point at which anaer obic metabolism is needed to pr ovide energy). Moderate physical activity increas- es heart rate to around 60-75 per cent of its maximum (and the ener gy requir ement can usually be met by aerobic metabolism using the body's stores of glycogen andthen fats). Light physical activity has only minor effects on heart and breathingrates. Sedentary activity (or inactivity) involves no noticeable ef fort: hear tand breathing rates are not raised 'resting' levels. 3Also see 5.2.2.1.Box 5.1 Ener gy cost and intensity of activity201CHAPTER 5 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY lysedentary people this may be as little as 15 per cent.289 See bo x5.2. The combined contribution of multiple types of physical activity can also be characterised in terms of metabolic equiv-alent (MET)-hours. METs are usually converted to MET-hoursper day or per week, which are calculated as the sum of theMET level for each activity multiplied by the duration theactivity was performed. 5.3 Interpr etation of the evidence 5.3.1 General For general considerations, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5 and boxes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6, and 3.7. Relative risk (RR) is used in this Report to denote ratio measures of effect, including riskratios, rate ratios, hazard ratios, and odds ratios. 5.3.2 Specific Some considerations specific to physical activity ar eas follows. Patterns and ranges. Large studies of physical activity are mainly undertak en in high-income countries. Such studies tend to pay most attention to voluntary recreational activity and may ther eforehave limited relevance to populations in lower -income countries. In these countries, overall activity levels may be higher and physical activity is mostly of the type classed as occupational, household, or transport. The evidence summarised in section 5.4 of this chapter generally suggests that the more physically active people are, the better, but with one cautionary note. At levels well abovewhat people at any level of fitness are accustomed to, and well above the ranges reviewed in this Report, vigorous phys- ical activity has a suppr essive effect on immune function. This not only incr eases vulnerability to infectious agents but also to DNA damage. Also see chapter 2.4.1.3. Classification. Thereis curr ently no generally agr eed clas-sification of different levels of overall physical activity, with quantified degr ees of activity corr esponding to terms such as 'active' and 'sedentary'. Measurement . Physical activity is rarely measured precise- ly. Ideally, studies would record the frequency, intensity, andduration of people's physical activity over an extended period\u2014day and night. But studies ar egenerally not designed to obtain this information .Objective measur es such as pedome- ters and microcomputer sensors are not often used in large studies. Instead, questionnair es aremost fr equently used. Terminology .Analysis of studies shows that what is meant by and included as 'physical activity 'varies. Study design .Different methods of measuring physical activity are reported in the literature, making comparisonbetween studies difficult. Confounding. In high-income countries, people who ar e physically active also tend to be health conscious and so ,for example, are more likely to be non-smokers and to choose diets they believe to be healthy. This may confound findingsthat show associations with the risk of cancer . Repor ting bias. Questionnair es measur esome forms of phys- ical activity mor eaccurately than others. Thus, people tend to recall vigorous and recreational, and other voluntary activ- ities, with relative accuracy. However, these activities are gen-erally performed for r elatively short periods of time and may amount to a smaller than perceived proportion of a person's total physical activity. 5.4 Evidence and judgements Studies examining physical activity and cancer were includ- ed in the SLRs. There is evidence, both epidemiological andmechanistic, that physical activity may pr otect against cancerThe evidence judged in this chapter shows that higher rather than lower levels ofphysical activity protect, or may protect, against a number of cancers. Most studies of physical activity are carried out in high-income countries with low average levels of occupational, household, and transport physical activity (characterised as sedentary ways of life). What are now regarded as high levels of physical activity in urbanised and industri- alised settings correspond roughly to what were average levels of physical activity inmost (including high-income) countries until well into the second half of the 20thcentury. 4Since then, occupations have generally become more sedentary: machines do more household work; more people drive or ride in cars or buses than cycle or walk; and for children as well as adults, active recreation has been largely replaced by watching television or other sedentary pursuits. This Report has a global perspective, and the Panel agrees that the evidence assessed inthis chapter can, with equal validity, be judged inversely. This means that relative-ly low levels of physical activity \u2014 as now typical in high-income countries and inurban-industrial settings in all continentsand most countries throughout the world \u2014are or may be a cause of cancers of the colon, breast (postmenopause), and endometrium. Also, these low levels are, or may be, a cause of weight gain, over-weight, or obesity, which themselves are causes of some cancers. The evidence judged in this chapter supports the gener- al theory that the human species has evolved and adapted to be physicallyactive throughout life, and therefore that sedentary ways of life are unhealthy. Evidence that sedentary ways of life increase the risk of diseases other than can- cer is summarised in Chapters 8 and 10.Box 5.2 Sedentary ways of life202PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS in general. Large studies carried out in the USA have shown that physical inactivity is associated with higher overall can-cer incidence and mortality. 10-12These studies are support- ed by studies on animals.13Mechanistic r easons why physical activity may pr otect against cancer (or why seden - tary living may promote cancer) include healthier levels of circulating hormones and the ability of the mor eactive body to consume more food and nutrients without gaining weight (see Chapter 2). Mechanisms by which physical activity mayprotect against color ectal cancer and female hormone-r elat- ed cancers are summarised in the following sections. Evidence from the literature on physical activity and can- cer in general indicates that the relationship between phys-ical activity and health is continuous: that is, there does notappear to be a thr eshold below or above which no effect is found. 14 15This implies that, in general, the mor ephysical - ly active people ar e, the better ,within the range examined. The Panel agrees that this general judgment is supported by the evidence on physical activity and cancer, which is sum-marised, assessed, and judged below . The full SLRs are contained on the CD included with this Report. 5.4.1 Colorectal Eleven cohort studies investigated total physical activity and colon or color ectal cancer .16-26 Twelve cohort studies inves - tigated activity21 27-36and 24 inves- recreational activity.10 17 21 25-27 29 30 34 37-51Five cohort studies investigated frequency of physical activity,10 16 26 50 52 and seven investigated intensity of physical activity.22 26 34 37 46 51 53Case-contr ol studies that investigated physical activ- ity can be found in the full SLRs. Also see chapter 7.9. Total physical activity Of the 11 cohort studies consider ed, 816-22 26reporteddecreased risk for the highest physical activity groups when compared to the lowest. This was significant overall in three studies17-19and in two additional studies in men but not in women.16 26One cohort study reported non-significant increased risk for the lowest physical activity groups when compared to the highest.25Meta-analysis was not possible on these studies due to the heterogeneity with which physical activity was measured. Six studies were included in a highest versus lowest analysis, shown in figure 5.4.1. Three studiesinvestigated cancer of the rectum, with mixed results. 17 18 21 Occupational Of the 12 cohort studies considered, 6 compared highest to lowest occupational activity groups.21 25 27-30All reported decreased risk, which was significant in two2730and bor- derline significant in one.25Six cohort studies compared sedentary occupational activity to high occupational activi- ty31-36and all reported increased risk for sedentary activity. This was significant in three studies.32 33 35Five studies that investigated color ectal cancer ar eincluded in a highest ver - sus lowest plot, shown in figure 5.4.2. Five studies that inves- tigated r ectal cancer ar eexamined in a separate highest versus lowest plot, shown in figure 5.4.3. Recreational Of the 24 cohort studies considered, 22 compared highest to lowest physical activity groups. All but two of these stud-ies reported decreased risk, which was significant in seven studies. 21 25 26 30 38 41 46The Health Pr ofessionals F ollow-Up Study reported an RR of 0.53 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32-0.88) comparing men in the highest quintile of physi - cal activity to men in the lowest quintile, with evidence of adose-response relationship (p for trend = 0.03). In the highest quintile, men r eported a median of 47 MET -hours of activity a week; in the lowest quintile, the median was 0.9 MET-hours.41 Five studies examined rectal cancer separately, comparing highest with lowest physical activity groups: two reported non-significant decr eased risk, 25 27one r eported eased risk.30 41Fourteen studies that examined color ectal cancer are included in a highest versus lowest plot, shown in figure 5.4.4. Apublished meta-analysis of 19 cohort studies reported significant decr eased risk of colon cancer for men with high levels of occupational activity, and also for men and women with high levels of r ecreational activity. Nine of these stud- ies examined dose r esponse; a significant inverse tr end was reported in six studies. Physical activity was not associated with decreased risk of cancer of the rectum.54 Walking Two cohort studies examined measures of walking. A sig- nificant increased risk was found in men who reported a 'slower walking pace than others' compared to those who said they had a 'faster walking pace than others'.39In a study that examined time spent walking, decr eased risk was r eport - ed in men who walked for more than 60 minutes a day com- pared to men who walked for less than 20 minutes a day,but this was not significant. 51 Figure 5.4.1 Total physical activity and colorectal cancer; 0.89 Men (0.54-1.22) 0.2 0.5 2 5 1Relative risk (95% CI) Relative risk, highest vs lowest exposure category203CHAPTER 5 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Frequency Of the five cohort studies assessed, thr ee reported decreased risk for the highest frequency of physical activity when com- pared to the lowest.16 26 50In two of these studies, this find - ing was significant in men but not in women .16 26One study reported non-significant increased risk comparing highest with lowest frequency of activity.44Another study, comparing lowest with highest fr equency of activity ,reported non-sig - nificant increased risk in women but no association in men.10 Intensity Six cohort studies investigated intensity of physical activity, of which five r eported an association between increased intensity and decr eased risk. F our r eported decr eased risk comparing high with low intensity of physical activity,26 37 46 51which was significant in all but one study.51One study reported a significant incr eased risk comparing low with highintensity of physical activity,34and another study reported no association .53 Mechanisms There are a number of mechanisms by which physical activ- ity may protect against colorectal cancer. These include areduction in insulin resistance, the beneficial effect of phys- ical activity on body fatness (see Chapter 6), the effects onendogenous ster oid hormone metabolism, and r educed gut transit time. 55 56 Thereis abundant epidemiological evidence from prospective studies showing lower risk of colorectal cancer with higher overall levels of physical activity ,as well as with gr eater fr equency and intensity ,and ther e is evidence of a dose-response effect. There is little heterogeneity, except that the effect is not as clear for rectal cancer as it is for colon cancer .Thereis plausible evidence for mechanisms operating in humans. The evidence that higher levels of physical activity, within the range studied, protects against colon cancer, isconvincing. The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR ,four cohort56A-56Dand four case control studies56E-56Hhave been pub- lished.

The heterogeneity was related to the size but not the direction of effect. Mechanisms There are a number of mechanisms by which physical activ- ity may protect against breast cancer in general. Theseinclude the beneficial effect of physical activity on body fat- ness (see Chapter 6), effects on endogenous steroid hormone metabolism, and a possible strengthening of the immune sys-tem. Physical activity may r educe levels of cir culating oestr o- gens and androgens. The P anel's judgment is given not on br east cancer in gen - eral, but separately for premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer.

These include the beneficial effect of physi-cal activity on body fatness (see Chapter 6); effects onendogenous ster oid hormone metabolism; and a possible strengthening of the immune system. Also ,high levels of physical activity are associated with lower levels of circulat- ing oestrogens and androgens in postmenopausal women. 14 There is generally consistent evidence, mostly from case-contr ol studies, showing lower risk of cancer of the endometrium with higher levels of physical activity .

All four case-control studies reported a significant decreased risk comparing high to low levels of activity. 135-138 Mechanisms Nomechanisms were identified by which physical activity might have a specific effect on the risk of lung cancer. The possibility could not be dismissed that people with pulmonary disease, who are at increased risk of lung cancer, mightreduce their level of physical activity. The association between physical activity and lung cancer is complex. Unlike many other cancers, lung cancer is not positively associated with body mass index (BMI). The Panel is aware that the observed association between physical activ- ity and lung cancer may be a r eflection of r everse causation due to chronic lung disease. There is evidence from prospective and case-control studies showing lower risk of lung cancer with higherlevels of physical activity, but there is no evidence ofplausible mechanisms. The relationship between activity,BMI, and lung cancer makes the evidence difficult tointerpr et. There is limited evidence suggesting that physical activity pr otects against lung cancer . The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR ,one cohort study138Ahas been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). 5.4.5 Pancreas Three cohort studies44 139 140and one case-control study141 investigated total physical activity and pancreatic Three cohort studies139 142 143and two case-control studies129 144investigated occupational activity 140 142 145-149and thr ee case-contr ol studies150-152investigated recreational activity.

There is limited evidence suggesting thatphysical activity pr otects against pancreatic cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study154Ahas been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement (see bo x3.8).5.4.6 Prostate Two studies showed that higher levels of physical activity were associated with lower risk specifically of advanced or aggressive prostate cancer.155 156Also see chapter 7.14. In the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, a strong inverse association between vigorous physical activity and advanced prostate cancer was seen in men 65 years or older: RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.17-0.62) for more than 29 MET-hours compared to none. No association was seen in younger men.155 In the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study IINutrition Cohort, high levels of recreational physical activ- ity were associated with decreased risk of aggressive prostate cancer: RR 0.69 (95% CI 0.52-0.92) for more than 35 MET-hours per week compared to no physical activity. Noassociation was found between recreational physical activi-ty and overall prostate cancer. 156 Mechanisms Several mechanisms have been proposed for how physical activity may decr ease the risk of pr ostate cancer .Exercise may reduce prostate cancer risk by reducing levels of testos- terone and insulin .Acute ex ercise may pr omote the forma - tion of free radicals. In people who exercise consistently, this may induce the production of enzymes, such as superoxidedismutase, that protect against oxidative stress. Theseenzymes may also protect against cancer, since dietaryantioxidants have been linked to reduced cancer risk. The P anel has noted the evidence pr esented her ethat physical activity is associated with reduced risk of advanced or aggr essive cancer of the pr ostate, but has not made a formal judgement. 5.5 Comparison with previous report The panel responsible for the previous report judged that the evidence that physical activity protects against cancer of thecolon was convincing. Evidence for cancer of the r ectum was judged to be unimpr essive. Physical activity was judged to be possibly pr otective against cancers of the lung and of the breast. The previous report mentioned epidemiological, experimental, and mechanistic evidence suggesting thatphysical activity is generally pr otective against cancer, and in particular against colon cancer and female hormone-relat- ed cancers. The panel r esponsible for that r eport also con- cluded that all types of physical activity wer eprobably beneficial and that people should remain physically active throughout life. 5.6 Conclusions The Panel concludes: The evidence that physical activity pr otects against colon cancer is convincing. Physical activity pr obably pr otects against postmenopausal breast cancer, whereas the evidence suggesting that it protects against premenopausal breast can-cer is limited. Physical activity pr obably pr otects against can - 209CHAPTER 5 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY cer of the endometrium. The evidence suggesting that phys- ical activity protects against cancers of the lung and pancreas is limited. The Panel notes the overall consistency of the evidence. The Panel emphasises that, taken together, the evidence suggests that all types and degrees of physical activity are or may be protective, excluding extreme levels of activity: the evidence for any specific type or degree of physical activity is limited.The evidence is consistent with the message that the more physically active people are, the better. The Panel also agrees that physical activity, which promotes healthy weight, would be expected to protect against cancerswhose risk is increased by overweight, weight gain, and obe-sity, and conversely that sedentary living increases or mayincrease the risk of the specified cancers (see Chapters 6 and 8). Most people in urbanised and industrialised settings, not only in high-income countries but throughout the world,now lead sedentar yways of life. 210PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS The size and shape of the human body, the rates at which humans grow from conception to adult life,and human physical and mental development areall determined by interrelated genetic and environmental, including nutritional, factors. Specifically, human nutrition, the degree to which the body' sneeds ar emet by the natur e, quality ,and quantity of the foods consumed, has a fundamental effect on health and well-being, and also on the body's ability to resist diseases. These include notonly infectious diseases but also chronic diseases,one of which is cancer. The Panel decided that the evidence apparent in the literature concerned with body composition,growth, and development, including breastfeeding (lactation), was likely to pr ove of special inter est. For this reason, the independent systematic literatur ereviews, on which the evidence and judgements in this chapter are based, have covered these areas more thoroughly than has previouslybeen attempted. The three related sections of this chapter pay special attention to degree of body fatness, rates ofgrowth and their outcomes, and also to lactation inrelation to the risk of cancer throughout the lifecourse. The first of these sections, which focuses onbody composition, is complemented by Chapter 8on deter minants of weight gain, over weight, and obesity. The findings of the systematic literature reviews aresummarised and judged within each section. The matrices that are part of the introduction of each section display the Panel' sjudgements, which ar e developed or qualified when necessar yin footnotes. Introductory passages also summarise relevant context. Other passages review issues of interpr etation of the literatur eand compar ethe findings of this with the previous report. For convenience, and also throughout this Report, the Panel's summary judgements are repeated at theend of each section. The pictur ethat emerges is impressive: much moreso than that based on the evidence gather ed in the mid-1990s using the then agreed methodology. Its implications are also impressive.Some of the most persuasive evidence in the wholefield of food, nutrition, and physical activity indicates that the basis for prevention of cancershould be a whole life course approach, starting atthe beginning of life, or even in maternal preparation for pregnancy.Body composition, growth, and developmentCHAPTER 6211CHAPTER 6 BODY COMPOSITION, GROWTH, AND DEVELOPMENT Akey reason for the success of Homo sapiens is our adaptability. Humans have evolved to survive and flourishin almost all environments and circumstances which,during the 25 0 000 years of our species' existence, have usually included occasional or regular food scarcity and insecurity .Wehave built-in defences against starvation: our own stor es of fat that ar eused in times of need. Food insecurity remains endemic, particularly in Africa and Asia. But many people in the world now have access to morethan enough to eat and drink and ar ealso r elatively physically inactive (see Chapter 5). As a result, stores of body fat tend to increase. What is now a pandemic of overweight and obesity can be seen as a response tocircumstances of plenty. One consequence, in the context ofreduction in rates of nutritional deficiencies and infections of childhood and early life, and the ageing of humanpopulations, is an increase in the rates of chronic diseases.These include cancer. Overall, the P anel judges that evidence on the degr ee ofbody fatness and the risk of cancers of a number of sites is strong and generally consistent. The Panel emphasises that the risk of cancer is modified, not only by obesity, asusually defined, but by overweight as well, and even bydegrees of body fatness generally regarded as healthy. The P anel judges as follows: The evidence that greater body fatness is a cause ofadenocarcinoma of the oesophagus, and cancers of the pancr eas, color ectum, br east (postmenopause), endometrium, and kidney, is convincing. Greater body fatness is probably a cause of cancer of the gallbladder. There is limited evidence suggesting that greater bodyfatness is a cause of liver cancer. The evidence that greaterabdominal (central) fatness is a cause of color ectal cancer is convincing; and gr eater abdominal fatness is pr obably a cause of cancers of the pancreas, breast (postmenopause), and endometrium. By contrast, greater body fatnessprobably pr otects against pr emenopausal breast cancer.BODY FATNESS, AND THE RISK OF CANCER Inthe judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence.

See Chapter 8 for judgements on physical activity and sedentary ways of life, the energy density of foods anddrinks, breastfeeding, other factors, and the risk of weight gain, overweight, and obesity. Within the remit of this Report, the strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of 'convincing' and'probable', shows that greater body fatness and greater abdominal fatness are causes of cancer of the colorectum; that greater body fatness is additionally a cause of breast(postmenopause), shows that greaterabdominal fatness is probably a cause of cancers of the pancreas, breast (postmenopause), and endometrium; but that greater body fatness probably protects againstpremenopausal br east cancer . Body fatness and organ mass and composition, commonly assessed by body size measurements, are key factors influ-encing health and well-being throughout the life course. The main concern of nutrition science, since its beginnings and until the mid-20th century, has been to protect popula-tions against the consequences of malnutrition in the 'clas - sic' sense of the wor d. That is undernutrition ,which increases vulnerability to infectious diseases, especially in infancy and childhood, and r esults in people who ar esmall and weak, unable to be productive, and with low life expectancy. 1This remains a central public health priority for middle- and low-income countries.2 In the final two decades of the 20th century and into this century, a different and imperative public health nutritionconcern has emerged: weight gain, overweight, and obesi-ty. At first, it was generally assumed that societies whosebabies ar ebig, whose children grow fast, and whose adults areheavy and tall, wer ehealthy. Compared to societies with inadequate nutrition and poor public health pr ovision ,such populations are indeed physically stronger, more productive, have longer lives, and are generally healthier. This said, since the 1980s, a series of r eports based on a rapidly increasing evidence base have concluded that popu- lations of high-income countries, and now also populationsof many middle- and low-income countries, ar ebecoming overweight to an extent that is bad for health. These coun- tries are almost exclusively those experiencing social, eco-nomic, and nutritional transition .The nutritional transition ischaracterised by a shift from 'traditional' diets that are low in fat and high in fibre to high-energy 'Western' diets that arehigh in fat and low in fibre. It is now generally accepted that obesity, but also overweight short of obesity, increases the risk of a number of major chr onic diseases including insulin resis- tance, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and str oke, type 2 dia - betes, and coronary heart disease, as well as cancers of some sites. 3In this chapter, the evidence on body fatness and can- cer is summarised and judged. Also see Chapter 8 .In this Report, the term 'body fatness' refers to the degree of body fatness across the whole range, not only the con- ventional categories of overweight and obesity. 6.1.1 Definitions and patterns 6.1.1.1 Body fatness Excess energy from food is stored as fat in the body in adi- pose tissue. The amount of this body tissue varies more from person to person than any other type (such as muscle, bone, or blood). The size and location of these fat stores also vary considerably between populations, people, and over the course of a person's life. Excess body fat is a cause of a num-ber of chronic diseases and reduces life expectancy (also seeChapter 8). Since the 1980s, typical body compositions have changed, with a worldwide increase in average body fatness and in overweight and obesity. This change is most notable in high-income countries, and in industrial and urban envir onments in many if not most countries (see chapters 1.1.3 and 1.2.2). In several low-income countries, high levels of body fatness exist alongside undernutrition in the same communities and even in the same families. 3 Body fatness is difficult to measure directly or accurately. However, because body fatness is the most variable deter-minant of weight, several weight-based measures are usedas mark ers of body fatness. The most common is the body mass index (BMI), a measur eof weight adjusted for height. BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in metr es squar ed (kg/m 2). In most cir cumstances, BMI has been shown to be reliably linked to body fatness.4But this method does not always provide an accurate measure:unusually muscular and lean people (such as manual work - ers and power athletes) have a relatively high BMI, even if they have relatively little body fat. See table 6.1.1 and alsoChapter 8. ABMI of between 18.5 and 24.9 is generally regarded as 'healthy 'or 'normal' (healthy or normal body fatness). This is roughly equivalent to 15-20 per cent body fat in adult men and 25-30 per cent in adult women . 5The 'under weight' or 'thin' range is a BMI below 18.5 (low body fatness). Above 25 (high body fatness), there are common gradings for over-weight, obesity ,and extreme ('morbid') obesity. The risk of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure increases with BMI with no clear thr eshold, but with a mark ed increase in risk as BMI appr oaches 25. 3The ideal average BMI for popula - tions has been estimated to be 21-22.6 The principal cut-off points shown in table 6.1.1 have been agr eed by the W orld Health Or ganization and ar ebased on the risks associated with being underweight, overweight, or obese (see Chapter 8). However, the healthy ranges ofBMI vary between populations. The additional cut-off points take this into account and are recommended for reporting purposes, with a view to facilitating international compar - isons. The principal BMI cut-offs are based on data primarily derived from populations of European origin living in high-income countries, so they may not apply globally .Differ ent213CHAPTER 6 BODY COMPOSITION, GROWTH, AND DEVELOPMENT BMI cut-off points have been proposed to classify overweight and obesity in differ ent populations, due to differ ent body composition and the relation of BMI to risk in these popu- lations. However, these have not become universally accept-ed. 78AWHO expert consultation on BMI in Asian populations recommended that the principal BMI cut-offpoints (table 6.1.1) should be retained as the internationalclassification. 9However, it also recommended that addi- tional cut-off points of 23, 27.5, 32.5, and 37.5 kg/m2 should be added to the international classification and, for reporting purposes, countries should use all categories (that is, 18.5, 23, 25, 27.5, 30, and 32.5 kg/m2;and in many pop - ulations, 35, 37.5, and 40 kg/m2)with a view to facilitat- ing international comparisons. The principal and additionalcut-off points ar eshown in table 6.1.1. At equivalent BMIs, many Asian populations have a high- er body fat content, wher eas Maori people and P acific Islanders have mor elean tissue and less fat. 410 11 Many Asian expert groups and health ministries now define the upper limit of 'acceptable' as a BMI of below 23, whereas the equiv-alent cut-off point for China is 24. It is unlik ely that the excess risk in these populations at relatively low BMIs reflects only differences in body fat \u2014 there are probablyother related metabolic changes, for instance, those induced by fetal and early childhood nutritional differences. WHO has r ecognised that Asian populations may choose a BMI cut-off of 23 because of the gr eater susceptibility of these groups of people to type 2 diabetes and perhaps other com- plications of excess weight gain. 9Mexican people have also been shown to be at gr eater risk, so Latin American popu -lations may also be considered as more sensitive to the effects of weight gain than white people of European origin.12 6.1.1.2 Body fat distribution Fat is not distributed equally around the body. It accumu- lates subcutaneously (beneath the skin) around the muscles of the upper arm, buttocks, belly, hips, and thighs. It also accumulates intra-abdominally or viscerally (around theorgans). Fat stores can be categorised as 'peripheral' (not around the trunk) or 'abdominal' (also called 'central'). The pattern of fat stores is determined largely by genetic factors, with a typically different pattern in men and women, which tends to change with age. Women tend to store more sub-cutaneous fat around their hips, buttocks, and thighs thanmen, producing a body profile known as a 'pear shape' (or'gynoid' pattern of fat distribution). Men are more likely to store fat around their abdomen, producing an 'apple shape' (or 'android' pattern). The size of peripheral fat stor es can be used as a measur e of total body fatness, although the proportion of total to abdominal fat varies between people. Waist cir cumfer ence is a measure that includes both subcutaneous and the more metabolically active intra-abdominal fat stores. The size of intra-abdominal fat stores predicts the risk of chronic dis-eases, such as metabolic disorders and cardiovasculardisease, better than overall indicators of body fatness, suchas subcutaneous fat measur es or BMI. 13The size of these fat stores also influences several hormone systems, such as insulin, as well as those involved in the body's response to inflammation ,both of which may play a r ole in cancer processes (box 2.4).14 15 Crude estimates of excess abdominal fat can be made by measuring either waist cir cumfer ence or by calculating the ratio of this measurement to hip circumference (the 'waist to hip' ratio), although this ratio is no longer recommendedas a useful indicator of abdominal obesity. Waist circumfer-ence is a better single indicator. As is the case for BMI, thecut-off points for ex cess waist measurements for Asian and Mexican populations ar eusually lower than those suggest - ed by WHO as suitable for people of Eur opean origin .This is because these non-white populations have a greater risk of disease with only modest increases in intra-abdominal fat.The WHO r eference values for waist circumferences of 94 cm (37 inches) in men and 80 cm (31.5 inches) in women (on apopulation basis) ar ebased on their r ough equivalence to aBMI of ar ound 25, wher eas waist cir cumfer ences of 102 cm (40.2 inches) in men and 88 cm (34.6 inches) in women are equivalent to a BMI of around 30. 16 17For Asian populations, cut-offs for waist cir cumfer ences of 90 cm for men and 80 cm for women have been proposed.18 6.1.1.3 Adult weight gain Increases in body weight during adulthood depend mostly on accumulation of fat rather than lean tissue, and ther e- foreany change may better r eflect fatness than adult attained weight itself, which is more dependent on lean mass. For this reason, evidence of associations specificallybetween weight gain in adulthood and cancers was soughtTable 6.1.1 The international classification of adult underweight, overweight, and obesity Abody mass index (BMI) of between 18.5 and 24.9 is generally regarded as'acceptable' or 'normal'. The 'underweight' or 'thin' range is a BMI of below 18.5. Above 25, the common gradings for overweight and obesity are as shown below: Classification BMI (kg/m2) Principal Additional Adapted with per mission fr om WHO.3214PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS in the systematic literature reviews that informed the Panel's judgements. 6.1.2 Interpretation of the evidence 6.1.2.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2,3.6 and 3.7. 6.1.2.2 Specific Some considerations specific to body fatness are as follows. Classification. The system of classifying underweight, 'nor- mal' weight, overweight, and degrees of obesity as discreteranges of BMI, is in general use. However, as shown in this chapter and also Chapter 8, the relationship between body fatness and cancer is continuous across the range of BMI. Forthis r eason , the P anel has chosen to use the term 'body fat - ness' rather than 'overweight' or 'obesity'. Measurement. BMI is not a perfect marker of body fatness. More precise techniques such as underwater weighing, mag-netic resonance imaging, computerised tomography, or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry are rare in large-scaleepidemiological studies due to their difficulty and expense.Abdominal fatness is usually measur ed either using the waist to hip ratio or the waist cir cumfer ence alone. There is a lack of consensus on how abdominal fatness is best measured, and measur ement err or is mor e likely than for some other anthropometric measures such as height and weight. The currently proposed maximum 'cut-off' points for 'healthy'waist cir cumfer ences (94 cm or 37 inches for men; 80 cm or 31.5 inches for women) and for 'healthy' waist to hip ratios (1.0 for men; 0.8 for women) are based almost exclusivelyon studies of cardiovascular or type 2 diabetes risk in whitepopulations in high-income countries. It is not knownwhether they can be applied to other ethnic gr oups or out- comes. The r elationship between waist cir cumference and the size of intra-abdominal fat stor es (as opposed to subcu - taneous abdominal fat stores) may vary between different ethnic groups. 18As body fatness tends to increase with age in most populations, and is characteristically higher in women than in men, it is important that studies take into account both age and sex. Measur ement of change in weight tends to be mor e precise than static measur es such as weight or BMI. Repor ting bias. Objective measur es of height and weight, and therefore BMI, are reliable. However, many studies rely on self-reporting, which is liable to introduce bias. Althoughreported and actual weights are correlated, weight tends to be under-reported, especially by overweight and obese peo- ple. BMIs calculated fr om self-reported data will therefore tend to be lower than fr om mor e objective measur es.6.1.3 Evidence and judgements The full systematic literature review (SLR) is contained on the CD included with this Report. There are several general mechanisms through which body fatness and abdominal fatness could plausibly influence can- cer risk. For example, increasing body fatness raises the inflammatory response, increases circulating oestrogens, and decreases insulin sensitivity. The physiological effects of obe-sity are described in more detail in Chapter 8. The effects of body fatness-related hormonal changes and inflammation on cancer processes are detailed in box 2.4. Additional site- specific mechanisms are described with the evidence for each cancer site in the following sections. 6.1.3.1 Body fatness Oesophagus Three cohort studies19-21and eight case-control measured by BMI) and oesophageal adenocar cinomas. All three cohort studies showed increased risk for the high- est body fatness, as measur ed by BMI, when compar ed to the lowest (figure 6.1.1); this was statistically significant in both sexes in one study21and in men but not women in two oth- ers.19 20Effect estimates were 2.58 in men (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.81-3.68; p < 0.001) and 2.06 in women (95%CI 1.25-3.39; = 0.002) 21; 2.40 in men 1.30-4.42) and 1.57 in women (95% CI 0.51-4.84)20; and 1.76 in men (95% CI 1.03-3.02) and 2.13 in women (95% CI0.97-4.71). 19The latter study was adjusted for smoking and alcohol but the other two wer e not. Seven case-control studies22-25 27-29showed increased risk for the highest body fatness group, as measured by BMI, when Figure 6.1.1 BMI and oesophageal adenocarcinoma; cohort and 2003Case control Kabal 1993Tretli 1999 Men Tretli 1999 Men Wu 2001Relative risk (95% CI) Relative risk, highest vs lowest exposure category215CHAPTER 6 BODY COMPOSITION, GROWTH, AND DEVELOPMENT compared to the lowest (figure 6.1.1). This was statistically significant in five studies,22-24 28 29and in men but not women in a sixth.25One study showed non-significant decreased risk.26Meta-analysis was possible on four case-control studies (all of which showed increased risk), giving an effect estimate of 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.15) per kg/m2, with mod- erate heterogeneity (figure 6.1.2). This would produce an increased risk of 55 per cent for each 5 kg/m2, assuming a linear relationship, although a curvilinear dose-response relationship cannot be ruled out.A dose-response relationship is apparent from case-control data (figure 6.1.3). Cohort data show a statistically signifi- cant trend in men and are suggestive of a similar trend in women. Studies that investigated body fatness, as measured by BMI, and all types of oesophageal cancer or squamous cell carci- nomas showed inconsistent results. Only when results were stratified by cancer type did a consistent pattern emerge, and then only for adenocarcinomas. An association between body fatness and increased risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma is consistent, with known geo- graphical and time trends for both BMI and adenocarcinomas. The general mechanisms through which body fatness could plausibly influence cancer risk are outlined in 6.1.3(also see box 2.4). The epidemiology is consistent, with evidence of a dose-response relationship. There is evidence for plausible mechanisms that operate in humans. Theevidence that gr eater body fatness is a cause of oesophageal adenocarcinoma is convincing. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort30 31and five case-control studies32-36have been pub- lished.

A dose-r esponse r elationship was apparent from cohort but not case-contr ol data (figur e 6.1.5). Although meta-analysis assumes a linear relationship, some cohort studies are sug- gestive of a curvilinear relationship, though not conclusive-ly so. The general mechanisms through which body fatness could plausibly influence cancer risk are outlined in 6.1.3(also see box 2.4). There is ample epidemiological evidence, which is generally consistent, and ther e is a dose-r esponse relationship. There is evidence for plausible mechanisms that operate in humans. The evidence that greater bodyfatness is a cause of pancr eatic cancer is convincing.The P anel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies30 74have been published.

There is no single, well-established mechanism through which body fatness could prevent premenopausal breast can-cer. According to the oestrogen plus progesterone theory,overweight premenopausal women would be protected because they would be mor e frequently anovulatory and therefore less exposed to endogenous progesterone. However, this theory is not well supported by recent studies, which suggest that natural progesterone could be pro-tective. 365Normal levels of natural pr ogesterone are likely to be protective and women who are well nourished, or perhaps overnourished, who may become slightly over - weight in adulthood, may be pr otected by their natural fertile condition. Another possible mechanism is that the increased adipose tissue-derived oestrogen levels in over-weight childr en could induce early br east differ entiation and eliminate some targets for malignant transformation. 366 Anovulation and abnormal hormone profiles are commonly associated with obesity.367The age-specific pattern of asso- ciation of breast cancer with BMI, therefore, is largely explained by its r elationship with endogenous sex hormone levels. Breast cancer diagnosed postmenopause is much more common. Therefore, throughout life, a decreased risk ofpremenopausal br east cancer would be expected to beoutweighed by an incr eased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (also see chapter 7.10). There is a substantial amount of consistent epidemiological evidence, with a dose response, butthe mechanistic evidence is speculative. Gr eater body fatness probably protects against premenopausalbreast cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort363and one case-contr ol study364have been published.

In addition , ther e was variation accor ding to whether BMI was derived from direct measurements or self- reports of weight and height, as well as in the outcome mea-sured. For example, one cohort and one case-control studyreported biliary tract cancer as opposed to gallbladder can-cer specifically , and some studies reported incidence while others r eported mortality . The general mechanisms thr ough which body fatness could plausibly influence cancer risk are outlined in 6.1.3 (also see box 2.5). In addition, obesity is a known cause ofgallstone formation and having gallstones incr eases the risk of gallbladder cancer (see chapter 7.7), possibly through bile cholester ol supersaturation leading to cholester ol-based gall- stones. High cholester ol in the bile is not necessarily r elat- ed to dietary cholesterol \u2014 it can also be caused by insulin resistance, which can be caused by obesity. Insulin resistancecan independently incr ease cholester ol synthesis in the liver and decrease cholesterol absorption. 518Bile cholesterol lev- els are also gender-linked: women excrete more cholesterolin bile than men. Owing to the link between gallstones and gallbladder can- cer, the P anel reviewed the dietar y causes of having gall- stones, especially in r elation to body fatness. BMI incr eased the risk of having gallstones in a linear fashion.519Waist cir- cumference was associated with risk in men, inde-pendently of BMI, 520and insoluble fibr e in protective effect.521Gallstone formation is strongly asso- ciated with dieting, especially where it involves rapid weight loss \u2014 such as seen with very low-energy diets and bariatric surgery.522 523Rapid weight loss is also a common feature of weight cycling. Weight cycling is associated with obesity and independently associated with gallstones; people who are more severe weight cyclers have a higher risk of gallstones.524 There is a substantial amount of generally consistent epidemiological evidence with some evidence of a doseresponse. There is evidence for several plausible mechanisms. Greater body fatness is a probable cause of gallbladder cancer, directly and also indirectlythrough the formation of gallstones. Liver Six cohort studies42 44 54-57 525and two case-control studies investigated body fatness526 527(as measured by BMI), or obesity, and liver cancer. Five cohort studies showed incr eased risk for the highest body fatness group compared to the lowest.42 44 54 55 57This was statistically significant in two studies,54 57and in men but not women in another two.42 55One cohort study showed a statistically significant increased risk in white men and asignificant decreased risk in black men. 56Effect estimates were 1.68 in women (95% CI 0.93-3.04) and 4.52 in men(95% CI 2.94-6.94) 42; 1.44 in white men (95% CI 1.28-1.61) and 0.68 in black men (95% CI 0.49-0.94)56; 1.56 in men (95% CI 1.15-2.12)57; 3.88 in men (95% CI 0.96-15.69)44; 1.9 in both sexes (95% CI 1.5-2.5)54; and 1.70 in women (95% CI 0.95-3.05) and 3.60 in men (95% CI 2.08-6.24).55 Neither case-control study showed any statistically signif- icant association .526 527 The general mechanisms through which body fatness could plausibly influence cancer risk are outlined in 6.1.3(also see box 2.4). The epidemiological evidence shows some inconsistencies, and the mechanistic evidence isspeculative. Ther e is limited evidence suggesting that greater body fatness is a cause of liver cancer.

There is a high potential forconfounding due to cigarette smoking, and residual con-founding is therefore possible. In addition, it is possible thatpeople with undiagnosed lung cancer may lose weight, sogiving a spurious association (r everse causation). There is no known mechanism through which greater body fatness could plausibly pr otect against lung cancer , or through which low body fatness could increase risk. Although the epidemiological evidence suggests an inverse relationship, this could be caused byconfounding by cigarette smoking or reverse causationdue to weight loss from undiagnosed cancer. There islimited evidence suggesting that low body fatness is acause of lung cancer . 6.1.3.2 Abdominal fatness Colorectum Seven cohort studies87 92 97 115 118 137 142and two case-control studies investigated waist cir cumference and colorectal cancer. Six cohort studies82 87 92 97 115 137 142and four case- contr ol studies investigated waist to hip ratio . Waist circumference All seven cohort studies showed increased risk with increased waist cir cumfer ence, which was statistically significant in six.87 97 115 118 137 142Meta-analysis was possible on four cohort studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.05 (95% CI1.03-1.07) per 2.5 cm (1 inch), with moderate heterogeneity (figure 6.1.22). Both case-control studies reported increased risk with incr eased waist circumference. Waist to hip ratio All six cohort studies showed increased risk with increased waist to hip ratio , which was statistically significant in five.87 97 115 137 142Meta-analysis was possible on five cohort studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 1.30 (95% CI 1.17-1.44) per ratio increment of 0.1, with moderate het-erogeneity (figure 6.1.23). Most case-control studies report- ed increased risk with increased waist circumference. Because of the abundant pr ospective data fr om cohort studies, case-contr ol studies wer e not summarised. The general mechanisms through which body fatness and abdominal fatness could plausibly influence cancer risk areoutlined in 6.1.3 (also see bo x 2.4). Many of these, such as increased circulating oestrogens and decreased insulin sen- sitivity, are particularly associated with abdominal ratherthan overall body fatness. There is ample, consistent epidemiological evidence with a clear dose r esponse and r obust evidence for mechanisms that operate in humans. The evidence that abdominal fatness is a cause of colorectal canceris convincing.

This new infor- mation does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). Pancreas Three cohort studies investigated waist circumference and pancreatic cancer.46 74Two cohort studies investigated waist to hip ratio51 74and one investigated patterns of weight gain.49 Waist circumference All three cohort studies showed increased risk with increased waist circumference, which was statistically significant in one. Effect estimates were 1.32 (95% CI 0.73-2.37) per 20 cm (7.9 inches) in women,461.74 (95% CI 1.00-3.01) per 20 cm (7.9 inches) in men,46and 1.13 (95% CI 1.01-1.26) per 10 cm (3.9 inches).74The latter study was published after the cut- off date for inclusion in the SLR. However, the Panel was aware of the study and agreed to include it in its considera- tion of this exposure. Waist to hip ratio Both cohort studies showed incr eased risk with incr eased waist circumference, which was statistically significant in one. Effect estimates were 1.12 (95% CI 0.81-1.55; high versus low)51 and 1.24 (95% CI 1.04-1.48) per ratio increment of 0.1.74The latter study was published after the cut-off date for inclusionin the SLR. However, the Panel was aware of the study and agreedto include it in its consideration of this exposur e. Patterns of weight gain The single cohort study showed a statistically significant increased risk with a self-reported tendency to abdominal (central) weight gain, when compared to peripheral weightgain. The effect estimate was 1.45 (95% CI 1.02-2.07). 49 The general mechanisms through which abdominal fatness could plausibly influence cancer risk are outlined in 6.1.3(also see box 2.4). There is a substantial amount of epidemiological evidence, generally consistent, and ther e is evidence for plausible mechanisms. Abdominal fatness is a pr obable cause of pancreatic cancer.

The general mechanisms through which abdominal fatness could plausibly influence cancer risk are outlined in 6.1.3 (also see box 2.4). Many of these, such as increased circu- lating oestrogens and decreased insulin sensitivity, are par-ticularly associated with abdominal rather than overall body fatness. There is a substantial amount of epidemiological evidence but some inconsistency. There is robustevidence for mechanisms that operate in humans.Abdominal fatness is a probable cause ofpostmenopausal breast cancer.

All four of these case-contr ol studies were adjusted for BMI. The general mechanisms thr ough which abdominal fatness could plausibly influence cancer risk are outlined in 6.1.3 (also see box 2.4). Many of these, such as increasedcirculating oestr ogens and decr eased insulin sensitivity, areparticularly associated with abdominal rather than overall body fatness. There is a substantial amount of generally consistent epidemiological evidence, but limited prospectivedata. There is evidence for plausible mechanisms.Greater abdominal fatness is a probable cause of cancer of the endometrium. 6.1.3.3 Adult weight gain Breast (postmenopause) Seven cohort studies158 159 167 193 576 581-586and 17 case-con- trol studies217 220 225 231 241 242 255 274 280 283 315 318 327 338 339 349 359 587-591investigated adult weight gain and postmenopausal breast cancer.

There is ample, consistent epidemiological evidence from both cohort and case-control studies. A doseresponse was apparent from case-control and cohortstudies. Adult weight gain is a probable cause of postmenopausal breast cancer. 6.1.4 Comparison with previous report The previous report used different terminology. It conclud- ed that the evidence that 'high body mass' was a cause ofcancer of the endometrium was convincing, and that highbody mass was probably a cause of cancers both of the breast(postmenopause) and the kidney. In the previous report, the evidence that high body mass was a cause of cancers of the colon and gallbladder was judged to be possible. Since thattime, several cohort studies and other epidemiological and other evidence have greatly strengthened the evidence onbody fatness, and specifically on over weight and obesity . Also, the distinction between adenocarcinomas and squa- mous cell carcinomas has identified a clear relationshipbetween body fatness and adenocarcinomas of the oesoph-agus. The previous report did not make any judgementsspecifically on abdominal fatness. The pr evious report did not include judgements on body fatness and pancr eatic cancer , although it did conclude that high energy intake was a possible cause of this cancer. 592It also noted data fr om corr elation and animal studies sug - gesting that high energy intake might increase the risk of cancer in general, without making any judgement. 6.1.5 Conclusions The Panel concludes: The evidence that gr eater body fatness is a cause of cancers of various sites is mor e impr essive now than it was in the mid-1990s. The evidence that greater body fatness is a cause of can- cers of the oesophagus (adenocarcinoma), pancreas, col-orectum, breast (postmenopause), endometrium, and kidney is convincing. Greater body fatness is probably a cause of gallbladder cancer , both dir ectly, and indirectly through the formation of gallstones. Ther e is also limited evidence sug - gesting that greater body fatness is a cause of liver cancer. The evidence that abdominal fatness is a cause of colorectalcancer is convincing; and abdominal fatness is pr obably a cause of cancers of the pancreas, breast (postmenopause), and endometrium. By contrast, greater body fatness proba-bly protects against cancer of the breast diagnosed before the menopause. The Panel notes that there is limited evidence suggesting that low body fatness (under weight) is a cause of cancer of the lung, but r esidual confounding with smok - ing and lung disease cannot be ruled out. See chapters 7.4 and 7.10, and Chapter 8 for discussion of the role of ener-gy density in weight gain , over weight, and obesity . 229CHAPTER 6 BODY COMPOSITION, GROWTH, AND DEVELOPMENT Growth in childhood is a predictor of age at sexual maturity and eventual adult attained height. Food quantityand quality , and the extent of infections and infestations during crucial periods of growth, are critical in determiningspeed of growth. Rate of growth has metabolic andhormonal effects, which can trigger lifelong consequences. Since the recognition of the vital importance of nutrition to human health and welfar e, public health nutrition policy has emphasised the need for birth weights and rates ofgrowth within ranges defined as those most lik ely to ensure physical and mental development in childhood, and good health in adult life. Such policies are essential. Newstandar ds based on the 'ideal' pattern of growth of healthy, breastfed infants have now been agreed by the World Health Or ganization. Overall, the P anel judges that evidence on the factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences,and the risk of cancers of a number of sites, is strong, consistent, and impr essive. The P anel emphasises that greater adult attained height, meaning how tall people are as adults, is unlikely directly to modify the risk of cancer. It is a marker for genetic, environmental, hormonal, andnutritional factors affecting growth during the period frompreconception to completion of linear growth. The Panel concludes : The evidence that the factors that lead to greater adultattained height, or its consequences, incr ease the risk ofcancers of the colorectum and breast (postmenopause) is convincing; and they probably also increase the risk ofcancers of the pancr eas, br east (pr emenopause), and ovary . There is limited evidence suggesting that the factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences,increase the risk of endometrial cancer. In addition, the factors that lead to greater birth weight, or its consequences, ar e probably a cause of premenopausal br east cancer. A major question for futur e research is: what are the factors that determine height in adult life? And, given the theme of this Report, what is the relative importance of genetic and envir onmental factors, what is the role of nutrition, and when in the life course are nutritional factors most r elevant? W eighing such evidence, given that adequate birth weight and gr owth ar e essential for good health in infancy and childhood, and throughout life, is a major challenge for the biological and nutritional sciences. Within the remit of this Report, the strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of 'convincing' and 'probable', shows that the factors that lead to greater adultattained height, or its consequences, are a cause of cancersof the color ectum and breast (postmenopause), and probably also of cancers of the pancr eas, br east (premenopause), and ovary. In addition, the factors that lead to greater birth weight, or its consequences, probablyincrease the risk of pr emenopausal br east cancer. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND THE RISK OF CANCER In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence.

Standards for birth weight and growth developed by expert panels for relevant United Nations agencies, and approved by UN member states, form the basis for nation- al, municipal, and local paediatric health policies and pro- grammes throughout the world. The WHO/UNU Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) of healthy, breastfedchildren is the basis for the WHO 2006 growth standards for children aged 0-5 years. 593 However, no growth standard has been validated in terms of lifelong risk for chronic diseases, including cancer. As with body weight (see chapter 6.1), policies and programmes con-cerned with the physical and mental development of infantsand children, and growth until adulthood, have focused onthe need to protect populations against the consequences of inadequate nutrition and retarded growth. This remains a central public health priority for middle- and low-incomecountries. In the 1990s, increasing concern, based on emerging evi- dence, was expr essed by the scientific community in this field. 594The concern has been that the agreed standards had 'overshot the mark' for optimum growth and health. For sev-eral reasons, the agreed growth standards for the first peri-od of life seemed to have been set unnecessarily andunhelpfully high. This perception was heightened by evi-dence of rapidly incr easing rates of childhood overweight and obesity , which tend to track into adult life (see bo x 8.3). As a result, new standards based on breastfed children were agreed and ratified, and issued in 2005, as guides to opti - mum growth. 593 This is the general context in which the Panel has exam- ined the evidence on gr owth and development, and the risk of cancer. 6.2.1 Definitions and patterns Growth incr eases metabolic capacity and also the ability to cope with envir onmental challenge. F rom a single cell at con- ception, human growth progresses through embryogenesis and fetal development, involving cellular multiplication anddiffer entiation in both structure and function. At birth, the body's tissues and organs are highly organised and regulat- ed. The timing and or der of these pr ocesses are determined by the selective expr ession of genes, which is both innate and modifiable by the wider environment, including the avail- ability of oxygen, energy, and nutrients. Nutrients also actby regulating hormones, gr owth factors, binding pr oteins, and receptors, and their activity. For every tissue or organ, adverse environmental influ- ences during critical periods of development, such as limit- ed energy or nutrients, can restrict development and future capacity for function . The timing, severity, and duration of any adverse exposur e will determine the extent and pattern of any restriction in capacity. Growth can be divided into three phases: fetal-infant, childhood, and puberty . 595During the first period, gr owth ismost sensitive to the availability of energy and nutrients. Brain growth is protected more effectively than growth in stature, which is protected more effectively than weight. So the timing of an adverse influence on growth tends to bereflected in a person's body shape, both as a child and as an adult. For instance, for lean tissue to be deposited efficient- ly and effectively, the appropriate pattern of nutrients must be available in a timely way. If any nutrients are limited but energy intake is adequate \u2014 or more than adequate \u2014 a person will be predisposed to excess body fatness. This is because their energy intake will exceed the nutrients available in the body for laying down lean tissue, so the excess energy is stored as fat. People who were of low birth weight have a greater tendency tostore fat, in particular abdominally. 6.2.1.1 Birth weight A baby's size and shape at birth indicates the extent and quality of intra-uterine growth and development. Birthweight can be measur ed simply and r eliably , wher eas head circumference, which marks growth of the brain, and length, which marks linear gr owth, ar e mor e difficult to measur e reli- ably. Within the usual range, heavier (and longer) babies tend to become taller children and adults. Birth weight predicts the risk of death and of various dis- eases in infancy and later in life. Very low birth weight \u2014less than 2.5 kg (5.5 lbs) for boys and 2.4 kg (5.3 lbs) forgirls \u2014 incr eases the risk of perinatal death and disease, or death in infancy and young childhood, usually because of increased vulnerability to infection and infestation. It is wellestablished, at least in high-income countries, that smaller size at birth, and at 1 year of age, predicts increased risk of chronic disease such as cardiovascular disease and type 2diabetes during adult life. 596This is due to a r educed capac - ity to cope with the stress of environmental challenges, such as a poor diet (including excess energy) and physical inac-tivity. Very high birth weight may also be associated withincreased risk \u2014 for instance, maternal diabetes or poor glu-cose homeostasis can cause higher birth weight as well asincreased risk of diabetes in the infant. 597These findings have been shown to be independent of smoking or socio - economic status, although they may be accentuated in the presence of these additional stress factors.598 The extent to which body fatness is a factor in any r ela- tionship between low birth weight and disease in later life remains unclear . The associations described above are strongest when low birth weight, or r estricted fetal gr owth, is followed by rapid growth during early childhood.599-602 Such effects can be experimentally induced in animals, lend- ing weight to the obser ved associations in humans being causal. 6.2.1.2 Infant and prepubertal growth The fetal-infant growth phase slows during the second half of the first year of life. The childhood phase of gr owth becomes established at 6-18 months. Any delay in the onsetof this growth phase tends to lead to shorter stature during childhood. Over an extended period of time, growth inheight and weight is a smooth pr ocess, although ther e may 231CHAPTER 6 BODY COMPOSITION, GROWTH, AND DEVELOPMENT be growth spurts or times of little change over shorter peri- ods. Growth, through the formation of new tissue, requires a dietary supply of energy (about 5 kilocalories per gram of new tissue) and macronutrients such as amino acids andfatty acids, as well as vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Each individual factor is vital; if any are limited they will con- strain normal growth and development. At any age, therefore, normal development requires appropriate genetic, hormonal, and nutritional factors tosupport growth. These in turn require adequate quantity and quality of food, and minimal exposure to food and environ- mental toxicants, infection, and psychosocial stress. As an infant gets older, the body is increasingly able to cope with environmental challenge. The pattern and timing of any nutrient shortfall deter- mines the pattern of constrained growth. Patterns of growthfailure are highly variable, comprising the differential effects on linear growth (stunting), weight (underweight and wast- ing), or on specific tissues. Thus stunting may be due to aperiod of slow gr owth or a delay to the onset of the child - hood phase of growth. If growth has been constrained as the result of an adverse cir cumstance, which is then r emoved, there is a drive towards returning to the growth pattern established previously or to the genetically determinedgrowth pattern. This 'catch-up' growth may be in height orweight, or some combination of the two; the term is oftenused without defining what type of growth is involved.However , 'catch-up' in linear growth after malnutrition is rare beyond the first 2-3 years of life. In the first 6 months of life, infants who are breastfed and then weaned appr opriately to mix ed diets gr ow differ ently from those fed on formula. This is partly related to the increased risk of infection for formula-fed infants and part-ly due to the differ ent compositions of human milk and for - mula feed. Normal child growth (under optimal environmental conditions) from birth to 5 years is specifiedin the WHO Child Growth Standards. 593 Throughout the world, particularly in high- and middle- income countries, and in urban ar eas generally, childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes ar e becoming mor e common. Childhood over weight and obesity often persists into adult life. This exposes people to the hormonal and physiological consequences of being overweight or obese earlier in adultlife, incr easing their risk of related health problems at a rel- atively young age (also see box 8.3). 6.2.1.3 Adult attained height Genetic and early life environmental factors, even before birth, are important in determining adult height. The envi-ronmental determinants of height attained in adulthood ar e highlighted by the variation between generations in adop- tion and migrant studies, where children are moved from apoor or limited nutritional background to an area of high or even overnutrition. 603Adult height is also linked to birth weight, rate of gr owth, and age of puberty. Periods of peak growth (such as in infancy and adolescence) ar e particular - ly important in determining adult height. Adult height increases as populations become less vulner- able to undernutrition , infestation , and infection , and as foodsupplies become more secure; it continues to increase when food is abundant (also see chapter 1.1). This trend has now slowed or even stopped in most high-income countries. Increases in height between generations are generally dueto increased leg, rather than spine, length. Leg length is linked to prepubertal growth, particularly to infancy (below the age of 5); after this age, trunk growth becomes more prominent. 604 605 Growth hormones, insulin-like growth factors, and sex hormone binding proteins all define the biological activity of the respective hormones. These in turn impact on height, growth, sexual maturation (boxes 6.2.1 and 6.2.2), fat stor- age, and many processes relevant to cancer (box 2.4). It is therefore plausible that nutritional factors that impinge onheight could also influence cancer risk, with adult height act-ing as a marker of that early life experience, in the same waythat taller people have a decreased risk of cardiovascular dis- eases, at least in high-income countries. 606-608 Therefore, both birth weight and adult attained height are mark ers of an aggr egated fetal and childhood experience; they are clearly also surrogates for important nutritional exposur es, which impact on several hormonal and metabol - ic axes, and which influence cancer risk (also see Chapter 2). 6.2.2. Interpretation of the evidence 6.2.2.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpr etation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 6.2.2.2 Specific Some considerations specific to gr owth and development ar e as follows. Measurement. Weight at birth is usually recalled accurately by parents. As well as full height, proxy measures may beused in some studies, including leg length, sitting height, ora ratio of these two . The ratio between overall height and limb length varies with genetic backgr ound and nutritional experience over the life course. 6.2.3 Evidence and judgements The full systematic literatur e review (SLR) is contained on the CD included with this Report. As indicated in 6.2.1.3, there are several general mecha- nisms thr ough which the factors that lead to gr eater adult attained height, or its consequences, could plausibly influ- ence cancer risk. However, adult attained height is unlikelyto directly modify the risk of cancer. It is a marker for genet- ic, environmental, hormonal, and also nutritional factors affecting gr owth during the period from preconception to completion of linear gr owth. F or example, adult height is the result of several stages of growth from fetal life through childhood. These are all influenced by nutrition, particular-ly in infancy , which in turn affects hormone levels, and ther e- 232PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS fore many processes relevant to cancer (box 2.4).

A dose-response relationship was apparent from cohort data. Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. The general mechanisms through which the factors that lead to gr eater adult attained height, or its consequences, could plausibly influence cancer risk ar e outlined in 6.2.1.3 (also see box 2.4). Many of these, such as early-life nutri- tion, alter ed hormone pr ofiles, and the rate of sexual matu - ration, could plausibly increase cancer risk There is ample pr ospective epidemiological evidence, which is consistent, and there is a clear dose response,with evidence for plausible mechanisms operating inhumans. The evidence that factors that lead to greater Early menarche is an established risk factor for breast cancer. From pooling project data, based on infor mation fr om 322 647 women, 4827 br east cancer cases occur red during follow-up, and the fully adjusted risk due to late menarche (at 15 years orabove compared with under 12 years ofage) was 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI)0.62-0.82). 613 A meta-analysis of 21 epidemiological studies (including both case-control and cohor t) repor ted a risk r eduction of about 9 per cent (95% CI 7-11) for each addition - al year of age at menarche. There was also a statistically significant gradient of risk when breast cancer was diagnosed early orbefore menopause, and a risk of about 4 per cent (95% CI 2-5) for later diagnoses. 614 A large cohort study (100 000 partici-pants) reported a 7 per cent per year decrease in breast cancer risk with increas- ing age of menar che for pr emenopause cases (p < 0.05). Compar ed to those who had their first period at 11 or younger, women experiencing menarche at 15 yearsor older had a risk of 0.66 (95% CI0.45-0.97). There was no statistically signif-icant ef fect for postmenopause cases. 615 Menarche marks the start of the cyclic production of oestrogen by the ovaries. Ther efore early menar che means that a woman is exposed to mor e oestr ogen over the course of her lifetime.616This is likely to be the mechanism by which age at menar- che influences breast cancer risk. As well asa longer lifetime exposure to oestrogen, early menar che may be associated with increased oestrogen levels during thewhole period of adolescence and early adulthood. 617 The first onset of br east development in girls occurs about two years befor e menar - che. The years preceding menarche are characterised by a sharp increase in adren-al androgens and the associated appear-ance of the first pubic and axillary hairs,and the first enlar gement of the br easts. At this age, adrenal androgens play an important role in inducing hypothalamic changes leading to menar che. 618In adult - hood, both befor e and after menopause, high serum androgen levels are associated with increased breast cancer risk.619 620 Consequently, nutritional exposures in early life that influence sexual maturation in women ar e also likely to have an indirect impact on later breast cancer risk.Box 6.2.2 Age at menarche and risk of breast cancerSexual maturity is the biological capability to have children. In girls, this is charac- terised by ovulatory cycles and/or menar- che, the onset of menstruation. In boys,pubertal stages are less easy to charac- terise, and indirect markers (secondary sex characteristics) are used, such as the age ofappearance of pubic hair. As a conse- quence, there are more data for sexual maturation in girls than boys. There is considerable variation in the age of sexual maturity, both between and among populations. In high-income coun-tries, the average age of menarche ranges from 12-13 years; this has dropped by around 3 years over the last 150 years,although the change has now generallyhalted. 609In low-income countries, and particularly among the most disadvan-taged populations, the average age of menarche may be as high as 16. 610These trends show the impact of environmentalinfluences on age at menarche. Adrenal sex hormone production nor- mally rises at around 6 years of age(adrenarchy) and coincides with a rise in BMI (adiposity rebound). Growth hor- mone, insulin-like growth factors, and sexhormone binding proteins all define the biological activity of the respective hor- mones. Children with an early adiposity rebound have earlier sexual maturationand higher risk of later obesity. Nutrition, birth weight, rates of growth, body fatness, and age of sexual maturity are all connected. The effects of these factors may be different in either sex, with increased body fatness lowering the age at menarche but slowing male sexual maturation. 611Conversely, early menarche increases the risk of adult obesity. Undernutrition delays the onset of puberty in both boys and girls.612Regular, intense physical activity can delay menar- che or cause menstruation to stop in laterlife. The combination of low birth weight and rapid growth in early childhood also accelerates the development of sexualmaturity.Box 6.2.1 Sexual maturity233CHAPTER 6 BODY COMPOSITION, GROWTH, AND DEVELOPMENT adult attained height, or its consequences, ar e a cause of color ectal cancer is convincing. The causal factor is unlikely to be tallness itself, but factors that promotelinear gr owth in childhood.

Adult attained height or factors that lead to it are probably acause of ovarian cancer. The causal factor is unlikely tobe tallness itself, but factors that pr omote linear growth in childhood. The P anel is awar e that since the conclusion of the SLR , one cohort study672and one case-control study673have been pub- lished.

The general mechanisms thr ough which the factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences, could plausibly influence cancer risk ar e outlined in 6.2.1.3 (also see box 2.4). Many of these, such as early-life nutri- tion, altered hormone profiles, and the rate of sexual mat-uration, could plausibly increase cancer risk. Although there is generally consistent evidence for prospective epidemiological data, there is some inconsistency in the evidence between cohort andcase-control studies, and the mechanistic evidence isspeculative. Ther e is limited evidence that gr eater adult attained height or factors that lead to it are a cause of endometrial cancer. The causal factor isunlik ely to be tallness itself, but factors that pr omote linear growth in childhood. 6.2.3.2 Greater birth weight Breast (premenopause) Six cohort studies150 319 678-681and four case-contr ol studies312 644 682 683investigated birth weight and pr emenopausal br east cancer . All six cohort studies showed increased risk with greater birth weight, which was statistically significant in three.150 679 680Meta-analysis was possible on four cohort studies, giv - ing a summary effect estimate of 1.08 (95% CI 1.04-1.13) per kg (2.2 lbs), with high heter ogeneity (figur e 6.2.8). Three case-contr ol studies showed incr eased risk with greater birth weight,644 682 683which was signif- icant in one.682Another study showed non-significant decreased risk.312 The general mechanisms through which the factors that lead to greater birth weight, or its consequences, could plau-sibly influence cancer risk are outlined in 6.2.1.1. Many of these, such as long-term programming of hormonal systems, could plausibly incr ease cancer risk. There is general consistency amongst the relatively few epidemiological studies, with some evidence for a doseresponse. The mechanistic evidence is speculative.

The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort363and one case-control study684have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (seebox 3.8). 6.2.4 Comparison with previous report The previous report used different terminology from this Report. It concluded that the evidence that rapid growthleads to earlier menar che (itself an established risk factor for breast cancer), and that greater adult attained height increas- es the risk of breast cancer, was convincing. It also concludedthat greater adult height was a possible cause of colorectalcancer. In general, evidence that the factors that lead to gr eater adult attained height, or its consequences, incr ease the risk of cancers of some sites, including color ectal and br east, has become stronger since the mid-1990s. 6.2.5 Conclusions The P anel concludes: The evidence that the factors that lead to greater adult attained height (meaning relative tallness), or its conse-quences, ar e a cause of cancers of various sites, is mor e impressive now than it was in the mid-1990s. The evidence that the factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences, increase the risk of colorectal cancer and postmenopausal breast cancer is convincing; and they pr obably increase the risk of cancers of the pancr eas, br east (pr emenopause), and ovar y. Ther e is limited evidence suggesting that the factors that lead to adult attained height, or its consequences, increase the risk ofendometrial cancer . Greater adult attained height is unlik e-ly to directly modify the risk of cancer. It is a marker for genetic, environmental, hormonal, and also nutritional fac- tors affecting growth during the period from preconception to completion of linear growth. The factors that lead to greater birth weight, or its conse- quences, are probably a cause of premenopausal breast cancer.

There is no completely adequate substitute. Br eastfeeding is natural both for the mother and her child, although some women find that they ar e unable to or do not want to br eastfeed. Lactation is the process by which the mother produces her milk. The Panel judges as follows: Evidence on lactation, breastfeeding by the mother, andher risk of breast cancer at all ages thereafter, is strongand consistent. It is supported by strong evidence forplausible biological mechanisms. The P anel concludes that lactation pr otects against both premenopausal and postmenopausal br east cancer. An implication of this finding, together with those in the earlier sections of this chapter, and also as summarisedand judged in Chapter 8, is that mor e emphasis should be given to factors acting throughout the life course that modify the risk of cancer . Ther e is limited evidence suggesting that lactation pr otects against cancer of the ovary. Within the remit of this Report, the strongest evidence, corresponding to the judgement of 'convincing', shows that lactation \u2014 breastfeeding by the mother \u2014 protects her against breast cancer at all ages thereafter . Human milk gives infants the best start in life. The view sometimes expr essed in the past, that infant formula may in normal cir cumstances be a complete substitute for human milk, is no longer held.685-687 The main focus of attention on breastfeeding and human milk, thr oughout almost all of the last centur y, has been onits benefits for the infant and young child during the peri- od of br eastfeeding, and then into the stage of weaning, and perhaps up to 5 years of age. This r emains a central part of public health nutrition science, policy, and practice.687 It is only r ecently that r esear chers and those concerned with public health policies have paid substantial attention to the effects of being breastfed on the health of the childin later life, and on the effects of lactation on the health ofthe mother. 687 688Thus, the previous report did not investi- gate what was then the small evidence base on breastfeed-ing and cancer risk (see 6.3.4). As shown in the previous two sections of this chapter, it is becoming incr easingly evident that early-life environment, including food and nutrition , is of fundamental importance to health and well-being thr oughout the life course. This has important implications for overall judgements and recom- mendations designed to promote health and prevent disease,and for public policy . These aspects are discussed in Part 3 of this Report, and in an accompanying report on policy implications, to be published in late 2008. 689 6.3.1 Definition and patterns In this Report, the term 'lactation' refers to the process by which the mother produces milk to breastfeed. While lac-tating women may express their milk for their own or anoth- er child, or for storage in human milk banks, lactation is usually synonymous with br eastfeeding. Breastfeeding pr ovides a complete sour ce of nourishment for newborns and young infants, and human milk also con- tains immunologically active components. The UN globalstrategy for infant and young child feeding r ecommends LACTATION, AND THE RISK OF CANCER In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence.

Pituitary hormones promote milk production after birth, with suckling acting as the stimulus to let down milk and to continue its production. During breastfeeding, men- struation reduces and often stops (amenorrhea). In almost all mammals, including humans, lactation induces a periodof infertility, which increases birth spacing. Babies tend to be weaned earlier in high-income countries. It is recom- mended that solid foods are not introduced until the infant is around 6 months old. With decreased suckling, lactation slows and then stops, and this is usually accompanied by areturn to normal menstruation. Breastfeeding was almost universal at the beginning of the 20th century. It declined in the mid-1900s, but has been increasing since the 1970s. 690However, disparity remains with socioeconomic status of mothers.691In some low- income countries, high socioeconomic class or education level of mothers is associated with reduced breastfeeding,wher eas the opposite is true in many high-income coun - tries. 692Older mothers and those educated to a higher level are more likely to breastfeed in high-income countries.693 694 In Africa, more than 95 per cent of infants are breastfed, often for a long duration, although exclusivity is low and therising prevalence of HIV may reduce breastfeeding. 695Also see chapter 4.11. 6.3.2 Interpr etation of the evidence 6.3.2.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpr etation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 6.3.2.2 Specific Some considerations specific to br eastfeeding and lactation are as follows. Patterns and ranges of duration. Most studies have been car- ried out in high-income countries where, since the second halfof the 20th centur y and until recently, duration of breast- feeding \u2014 exclusive or not \u2014 has usually been brief. Therefore the findings of these studies may be of limited r elevance to areas of the world wher e breastfeeding practices differ . Classification. Reports (as distinct from studies) concerned with chr onic diseases have not usually consider ed br east- feeding or other factors specific to infancy and childhood, despite what is now the general agreement that the out-comes of early life experience tend to track into adult life. Also, there is no agreed classification for duration and exclu- sivity of br eastfeeding. Measurement. Studies reporting on breastfeeding use the term with different meanings. Some studies have simply dis-tinguished between 'ever ' and 'never ', which means thatresults from minimal amounts of breastfeeding \u2014 exclusive or not \u2014 are combined with results from extended and exclu- sive breastfeeding. 6.3.3 Evidence and judgements The full systematic literature review (SLR) is contained on the CD included with this Report. The principal mechanism through which lactation or breast- feeding could plausibly influence cancer risk is the hormonal influence of the associated period of amenorrhea and infer- tility. This decreases lifetime exposure to menstrual cycles and therefore alters hormone levels, particularly androgens,which can influence cancer risk (box 2.4). Site-specific mech-anisms are described with the evidence for each cancer sitediscussed below.

There was no clear difference when results were stratified according to menopause status. Pooled analysis from 47 epidemiological studies in 30 countries (more than 50 000 controls and nearly 97 000breast cancer cases) showed a statistically significant decreased risk breast cancer with duration of lactation. There was an estimated reduction in risk of 4.3 per cent (95% CI 2.9-5.8; p < 0.0001). Menopausal status was not an effect modifier. 749 Forty-four case-control studies investigated breast cancer (age unspecified).215 229 232 244 254 262 273 281 290-292 295 299-302 306 318 335 337 340 349 355 748 Thirty-five of these showed decreased risk with increased total duration of lactation,215 229 244 254 262 273 281 290 295 299-302 306 318 335 337 349 355 356 703-705 707 717 725-727 729 734 736 737 748which was statistically significant in 18 stud- ies.215 244 254 273 281 300 337 349 705 707 713 717 726 727 736 737 743 747 748 Six studies showed non-significant increased risk291 292 697 730 735 738 740 741and three studies showed no effect of risk.232 340 712Meta-analysis was possible on 37 case-contr ol studies, giving a summary effect estimate of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.98) per 5 months of total br with moderate heter o- geneity (figure 6.3.1).

In addition to the hormonal effects of amenorrhea, the strong exfoliation of the breast tissue during lactation, and the mas-sive epithelial apoptosis at the end of breastfeeding, could contribute to risk decrease by elimination of cells with poten- tial initial DNA damage. There is abundant epidemiological evidence from both prospective and case-control studies, which isconsistent and shows a dose-r esponse r elationship.

As described in 6.3.2, substantial heterogeneity could be expected when assessing breastfeeding when, for example,exclusivity of breastfeeding is not always assessed. The general mechanisms through which lactation could plausibly pr otect against cancer are outlined in 6.3.3. There is evidence that the r educed number of menstrual cycles associated with breastfeeding protects against some cancers. There are sparse prospective epidemiological data, though some evidence for a dose response. Themechanistic evidence is speculative. Ther e is limited evidence suggesting that lactation protects againstovarian cancer.The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-control study761has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). 6.3.4 Comparison with previous report The previous report noted evidence that breastfeeding (meaning lactation) protected against breast cancer, but itdid not review the literature or make a judgement. 6.3.5 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The evidence on lactation and breast cancer \u2014 the mostcommon female hormone-related cancer \u2014 is impressive. Much of this has been published since the mid-1990s. The evidence that lactation protects against breast cancer, at all ages, is convincing. Ther e is limited evidence suggest - ing that lactation protects against ovarian cancer.

Projections for 2030 predict that these figures will double. Cancer is increasing at rates faster than the increase in global population. It isbecoming mor ecommon in high-income but also \u2014 and most of all \u2014 in middle- and low-incomecountries, absolutely and also r elative to other diseases. The scientific community is convinced that inherited high susceptibility to cancer accounts foronly a small proportion of cases. Although we areall more or less susceptible to various diseases,most adult cancers ar ecaused mainly by envir onmental factors. This means that most cancers are at least in theory preventable. One impor tant cause of cancer is smoking, or other exposure to, tobacco. Infection, infestation,solar radiation, and other factors are alsoimpor tant. Food and nutrition, physical activity , body composition, and other associated factors are also individually and collectively importantmodifiers of cancer risk. But there is a difference.Smoking and exposure to tobacco, and these otherfactors, ar eall causes of cancer. By contrast, this and the pr evious chapters show that food and nutrition, and physical activity can pr otect against cancer. When we are able to do so, we can choose ways of life that protect both ourselves and thenext generation against cancer .So our nutritional state \u2014 what we eat and drink, how active we are, and how much body fat we car ry\u2014not only as adults but also fr om and befor ebirth, vitally af fects our risk of many cancers. This chapter follows those on foods and drinks, physical activity ,and body composition, gr owth, and development. Its purpose is to summarise the evidence derived from independently commissioned and presented systematic literature reviews (SLRs),and the Panel's judgements and conclusions, as theyrelate to cancers of 17 sites. Together, these amount to roughly 80 per cent of the incidence of, and deaths from, all cancers worldwide. Evidence on a number of other cancers is also summarised briefly,based on nar rative r eviews. The sequence of the sections of this chapter corresponds roughly with the body's systems, orwith sites that have anatomical, metabolic,hormonal, or other features in common, and generally follows the sequence of the previous report. The str uctur eof all the sections, wher eevidence derives from these systematic reviews, is identical. After brief intr oductions, matrices display the Panel's judgements. In this chapter, the Panel'sjudgements also include the 'Limited \u2014 noconclusion' category, where evidence is, in thePanel's view, of such poor quality, or too sparse,confused, or conflicting, to allow a conclusion.Footnotes to these matrices include impor tant explanations or qualifications. Then follow subsections on trends, incidence, and survival; pathogenesis; and other established causes. The next subsection concerns interpretationof the evidence, in which issues and problemsrelated to specific cancer sites ar esummarised. 'Evidence and judgements' are the central subsections throughout this chapter. Here, theevidence from the SLRs, reported more extensivelywith graphics in Chapters 4, 5, and 6, is alsosummarised. The sequence of these subsections isthe same as that of Chapters 4-6. The str ongest evidence on pr otection fr om cancer comes first, followed by the strongest evidence on causation, and so on. Within each passage, summaries of thestatistically most power ful epidemiological studies come first, followed by other epidemiological studies, and then summaries of the experimentalliteratur eand evidence of biological plausibility . This is followed by the Panel's judgements, which take into account matters of quality and interpr etation. Then follows a subsection comparing the judgements of this Report with those of the previous report, with indications of why thesediffer when they do. All sections conclude with thePanel' sjudgements for each cancer site. CancersCHAPTER 7245CHAPTER 7 CANCERS Cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx, taken together, are the seventh most commonly occurring types of cancerworldwide. These cancers are three times more common inmen than in women. Over 550 000 cases were recorded in 2002, accounting for around 5 per cent of cancer cases overall. In general, the rates of these cancers aredecreasing. These cancers tend to r ecur.Survival rates ar e variable and average around 50 per cent at 5 years. Cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx ar ethe seventh most common cause of death from cancer. Overall, the Panel judges that food and nutrition play an important role in the prevention and causation of cancersof the mouth, pharynx, and larynx. The P anel judges as follows: The evidence that alcoholic drinks ar eacause of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx is convincing. The riskis multiplied when drink ers of alcohol also smok etobacco. Non-starchy vegetables, fruits, and also foods containing carotenoids probably protect against these cancers. Thereis limited evidence suggesting that mat\u00e9, a herbal infusion traditionally drunk scalding hot through a metalstraw in parts of South America, is a cause of oral cancer. The main single cause of these cancers is smoking tobacco. It has been estimated that up to half of thesecancers ar epreventable by appropriate diets and associated factors. In final summary ,the str ongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\", shows that alcoholic drinks are a convincing cause of these cancers;and that non-star chy vegetables, fruits, and foods containing carotenoids are probably protective. There are several different tissues and organs in and around the mouth, pharynx, and larynx. These include the lips, thetongue, the inside lining of the cheeks (buccal mucosa), the floor of the mouth, the gums (gingiva), the palate, and the salivary glands. The pharynx (or throat) is the muscular cav-ity leading from the nose and mouth to the larynx, which includes the vocal cords. Ninety per cent of cancers of the mouth, phar ynx, and lar- ynxaresquamous cell car cinomas, the type discussed her e. Cancers of the oropharynx (including the tonsils) and the hypopharynx are also included. For cancer of the nasopharynx,thecavity fr om the back of the mouth to the nose, see 7.2. FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCERS OF THE MOUTH, PHARYNX, AND LARYNX In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence.

For an explanation of all the ter ms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. 7.1 Mouth, pharynx, and larynx246PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 7.1.1 Trends, incidence, and survival Rates of cancers of the mouth and pharynx (age adjusted) are stable or decreasing in many high-income countries.There was a sharp increase between 1950 and 1980 in sev- eral European countries, such as Germany and France, although this has since reached a plateau and started to decrease. Laryngeal cancer rates appear to have been generally stable or decreasing since 1970. 1 Age-adjusted incidence rates of oral cancers range from 20-40 per 100 000 people in parts of south-central Asia, Europe, Oceania, and southern Africa, to less than 3 per 100 000 in parts of eastern Asia, northern and western Africa, and Central America. Pharyngeal cancers (other thanthose of the nasopharynx) follow broadly similar incidencepatterns, although the overall incidence is lower, with highsof more than 10 per 100 000 in south-central Asia and west- ern Europe, to a low of less than 1 per 100 000 in northern Africa. Age-adjusted incidence rates of laryngeal cancerrange fr om mor ethan 10 per 10 0000 in South America, south-central and western Asia, and southern, central, and western Eur ope to less than 1 per 10 0000 in many African countries. 2Rates are higher in men than in women by approximately three to one.2In the USA, rates are higher among African-American people than in white people.3 Risk increases with age, and diagnoses of these three types of cancer are most common in people aged 50 or over.4 Although cur erates are high for early-stage cancers of the mouth, phar ynx, and lar ynx, second primary tumours are rel- atively common at these sites.5More than 60 per cent of patients do not seek medical advice until the disease is at an advanced stage; in these cases, long-term survival rates are poor, especially if the cancer site is inaccessible.4Five-year survival rates ar earound 60 per cent in the US Aand 50 per cent in the UK.36These cancers account for just over 5 percent of all cancer incidence, but just under 5 per cent of all cancer deaths.2Also see box 7.1.1. 7.1.2 Pathogenesis Mouth, pharynx, and larynx cancers, like other types, are the result of genetic alterations that lead to small, localised lesions in the mucous membranes that grow in an abnormal way (dysplasia). These lesions may then progress to carci-noma in situ, and then become invasive cancers. Exposure to carcinogens, such as those in tobacco, can be prolonged and consistent. The mouth and pharynx are directly exposed to both inhaled carcinogens and those that are ingested by drinking and chewing \u2014 including, in thecase of chewing tobacco and betel quid, when it is spat outafter chewing. Chronic damage and inflammation caused bystomach acid are also implicated; some studies have found that laryngopharyngeal reflux (where stomach acid flows upwards to the larynx and/or pharynx) is associated withlaryngeal cancers. 78 Cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx frequently show multiple, independent, malignant foci \u2014 with second primary cancers occurring relatively frequently. This phe- nomenon occurs when an entire region of tissue is repeat-edly exposed to carcinogens. Around 90 per cent of oralcancers occur after exposure to tobacco or alcohol, or a com-bination of both. 9 7.1.3 Other established causes 7.1.3.1 General (Also see chapter 2.4.) Throughout this chapter ,this section lists factors outside the scope of this Report, identified as established causes of can- cer by the World Health Organization International Agencyfor Research on Cancer, and other authoritative bodies.These factors are as listed in chapter 2.4: tobacco use; infec-tious agents; radiation; industrial chemicals; and some med - ications. Other diseases may also incr ease the risk of cancer . In the same way ,life events that modify the risk of cancer \u2014causative and protective \u2014 are also included. 'Established' effectively means 'beyond reasonable doubt' \u2014roughly the equivalent of the judgement of 'convincing' used in this Report. Occasionally, authoritative findings that perhaps fall short of 'established' ar ealso included here. Wher epossible, a note of interactive or multiplicative effects with food, nutrition, and the other factors covered by this Report is added, as is any indication of scale or relativeimportance. The factors her earealmost all causative, wher e- as much of the evidence on food, nutrition, physical activi- ty, and related factors shows or suggests protection againstcancer. 7.1.3.2 Specific Other diseases .There is substantial evidence that gastric reflux increases the risk of oral cancers.The cancer incidence rates and figures given in this Report are those r epor ted by cancer r egistries, now established in many countries. These registries record cases of cancer that have been diagnosed. However, many cases of cancer are not identified or recorded: some countries do not have cancer registries; regions of some countries have few or no records; records in countriessuffering war or other disruption are bound to be incomplete; and some people with cancer do not consult a physician. Altogether, this means that the actual incidence of cancer is high-er than the figures given here. The cancer sur vival rates given in this chapter and elsewher e areusually overall global averages. Survival rates are generally higher in high-income countries and other par ts of the world where there are established services for screening and early detection of cancer and well established treatment facilities. Survival also is often a function of the stage at which a cancer is detected and diagnosed. The symptoms of some internal cancersare often evident only at a late stage, which accounts for rela- tively low sur vival rates. In this context, 'sur vival' means that the person with diagnosed cancer has not died 5 years after diag - nosis. Also see chapter 9.Box 7.1.1 Cancer incidence and survival247CHAPTER 7 CANCERS Tobacco use .Smoking, and other use of and exposure to tobacco, is the most important cause of oral cancers, includ- ing those of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx. These factors are estimated to cause around 60 per cent per cent of alllaryngeal cancers. While alcoholic drinks are an independent cause of these cancers, risk is multiplied if drinkers smoke tobacco and if smokers drink . 10Chewing of betel quid (with or without added tobacco) also causes oral cancers.11 Infection and infestation .Human papilloma viruses (HPVs) are a cause of oral cancers.12-14 7.1.4 Interpretation of the evidence 7.1.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this R eport to denote ratio mea - cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx include: Classification .Some studies did not r eport separately on can- cers of the mouth, phar ynx, or lar ynx, but grouped these cancers with others as 'head and neck cancers' or 'upper aerodigestive tract cancers'. The term 'head and neck can - cer' includes all of these sites plus cancers of the middle ear, the nasal cavity, and the paranasal sinuses. The term 'upperaerodigestive tract cancer 'includes all head and neck can - cers and oesophageal cancer (see 7.3). Confounding .High-quality studies adjust for smoking but may still be subject to residual confounding. Because of thesize of the effect of smoking, and the tendency for the dietsof smok ers to be low in vegetables and fruits, and for smok - ers to have r elatively lower body mass indices, r esidual con- founding is a particular concern for these exposures. Wherever possible, detailed stratification of the data accord-ing to smoking status was obtained. 7.1.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 238 publications were included in the systematic lit- eratur ereview (SLR) for cancers of the mouth, phar ynx, and larynx. Fuller summaries of the epidemiological, experi- mental, and mechanistic evidence are in Chapters 4-6. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.1.5.1 Non-star chy vegetables (Also see chapter 4.2.5.1.) Atotal of 31 case-control studies and 3 ecological studies examined non-star chy vegetables. Other gr oupings exam -ined were non-starchy vegetables and fruits (in combination) (1 cohort, 6 case-control); raw vegetables (23 case-control); cruciferous vegetables (1 cohort, 14 case-control, and 1 eco- logical); green, leafy vegetables (1 cohort, 10 case-control);carrots (3 cohort, 18 case-control); and tomatoes (1 cohort, 12 case-control). Most of the studies for the exposures grouped under non-starchy vegetables showed a decreased risk with increased intake. Meta-analysis showed a 28 per cent decreased risk per 50 g per day (figure 4.2.2). The dose-response relationship suggested that the greatest effect was produced by the first increment; that is, that some vegetable consumption confers a protective effect com- pared with none (figure 4.2.3). However, it is not clear that the effect continues in a linear fashion. It is possible that this is an artificial phenomenon produced by residualconfounding due to smoking. There is some unexplainedheterogeneity. This is a wide and disparate category, and many different plant food constituents are represented that could contributeto a pr otective effect of non-star chy trapfree radicals and reactive oxygen molecules, protectingagainst oxidation damage. It is difficult to unravel the rela-tive importance of each constituent and is likely that any pro-tective effect may r esult from a combination of influences on several pathways involved in car cinogenesis. Asubstantial amount of consistent evidence on non- starchy vegetables, including specific subtypes mostlyfrom case-control studies, shows a dose-responserelationship. Ther eis mechanisms. Non-starchy vegetables probably protectagainst mouth, pharynx, and larynx cancers. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort15 16and two case-contr ol studies17 18have been pub - lished. This new information does not change the P anel judge - ment. Also see bo x3.8. 7.1.5.2 Fruits (Also see chapter 4.2.5.2.) Atotal of 1 cohort study, 35 case-control studies, and 2 eco- logical studies investigated fruits. Other gr oupings examined werecitrus fruits (1 cohort, 23 case-contr ol, 1 ecological), and non-starchy vegetables and fruits (in combination) (1 cohort, 6 case-control). Most studies showed decreasedrisk. Meta-analysis showed a 18 per cent decr eased risk per 100 g per day for general fruits, or 24 per cent per 50 g per day for citrus fruits (figures 4.2.17 and 4.2.18). The dose-response relationship suggested that the greatest effect was produced by the first increment; that is, that some fruit con- sumption confers a pr otective effect compared to none. However ,it is not clear that the effect continues in a linear fashion (figures 4.2.19 and 4.2.20). It is possible that this is an artificial phenomenon produced by residual confoundingdue to smoking. 248PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Studies that reported on combined intake of non-starchy vegetables and fruits showed evidence of an association with decreased risk (see 7.1.5.1). Fruits are sources of vitamin C and other antioxidants such as carotenoids, phenols, and flavonoids, as well as other potentially bioactive phytochemicals. Antioxidants trap free radicals and reactive oxygen molecules, protecting against oxidation damage. It is difficult to unravel the relative impor- tance of each constituent, and is likely that any protectiveeffect may result from a combination of influences on sev- eral pathways involved in carcinogenesis. The evidence, including that on fruit subtypes, though mostly from case-control studies, is consistent, with adose-response relationship. There is evidence forplausible mechanisms. Fruits probably protect againstmouth, pharynx, and larynx cancers. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies1516and one case-contr ol study18have been pub - lished. This new information does not change the Panel judge- ment. Also see bo x3.8. 7.1.5.3 Foods containing carotenoids (Also see chapter 4.2.5.3.) Two cohort studies investigated total serum carotenoids, 10case-control studies investigated pro-vitamin A carotenoids,and 2 case-contr ol studies investigated total dietary carotenoids. Other gr oupings examined were 4 case-control); and serum lycopene (1 cohort, 1case-contr ol). All of the serum studies and most of the dietary studies showed decreased risk with increased mea- sures of carotenoids. Meta-analysis was not possible.Information comes predominantly from dietary sources, notsupplements; therefore no effect can be attributed tocarotenoids separate from foods. In trials, car otenoids have been effective at r educing cel- lular damage within the mouth, which may act as a pr ecur- sor to cancers in this region. Carotenoids are antioxidants. Oxidative damage is linked to the formation of tumoursthrough several mechanisms. Oxidative stress damages DNA. This might be prevented or limited by dietary antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables. There is a considerable amount of evidence, and though it is for different carotenoid types, it is generally consistent, with a dose-r esponse relationship. There is evidence for plausible mechanisms. Foods containing carotenoids probably protect against mouth, pharynx, and larynx cancers. The P anel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study15has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8.7.1.5.4 Mat\u00e9 (Also see chapter 4.7.5.6.1.) Six case-control studies were examined. All reported increased risk from drinking mat\u00e9, which was statistically sig-nificant in four. There is some biological plausibility. Mat\u00e9 is a herbal infu- sion traditionally drunk very hot through a metal straw. This produces heat damage in the mouth, pharynx, and larynx. Repeated damage of this nature could lead to cancer.Chemical carcinogenesis from constituents of mat\u00e9 has also been postulated. 19 20 The evidence is sparse. There is limited evidence suggesting that mat\u00e9 is a cause of mouth, pharynx, andlarynx cancers. 7.1.5.5 Alcoholic drinks (Also see chapter 4.8.5.1.) Five cohort studies, 89 case-control studies, and 4 ecologi-cal studies investigated alcoholic drinks. All cohort studies and nearly all case-control studies showed increased risk.Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 24 per cent incr eased risk per drink/week; case-control data showed a 3 per cent increased risk per drink/week (figure 4.8.2). The cohortstudies showed a curvilinear dose-response relationship. It is biologically highly plausible that alcoholic drinks are acause of mouth, pharynx, and larynx cancers. IARC clas- as a Class 1 car cinogen. Reactive metabolites of alcohol such as acetaldehyde can be car cinogenic. Ther e is also an interaction with smoking. Tobacco may induce spe- cific mutations in DNA that ar eless efficiently r epair ed in the presence of alcohol. Alcohol may also function as a solvent, enhancing penetration of other carcinogenic molecules intomucosal cells. Additionally ,the effects of alcohol may be mediated through the production of prostaglandins, lipid peroxidation, and the generation of free radical oxygenspecies. High consumers of alcohol may also have diets low in essential nutrients, making tissues susceptible tocarcinogenesis. Thereis ample and consistent evidence, both fr om case-control and cohort studies, with a dose-response relationship. There is robust evidence for mechanismsoperating in humans. The evidence that alcoholicdrinks are a cause of mouth, pharynx, and larynxcancers is convincing. Alcohol and tobacco togetherincrease the risk of these cancers mor ethan either acting independently. No threshold was identified. The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR ,one cohort15and four case-control studies21-24have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement.Also see box 3.8. 7.1.5.6 Other exposur es Other exposur es wer eevaluated. However ,the data wer e either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number of studies too few to allow conclusions to be reached. Thesewereas follows: cer eals (grains) and their pr oducts; 7 CANCERS roots, tubers, Fourteen case-control studies examined body fatness, as measured by body mass index (BMI). Meta-analysis pro-duced a statistically significant decreased risk with increased BMI, and a dose-response relationship, but reverse causality was implicated. That is, cancers of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx cause significant weight loss, often before diagnosis. Smoking is also associated with low BMI. For these reasons,the data were judged insufficient to allow any conclusion tobe drawn. 7.1.6 Comparison with previous report The main differences between this Report and the previous report ar esummarised her e, together with any r easons for these differences. When the findings here and in the previ- ous report are similar, this is usually not mentioned. Minordifferences are not always mentioned. 7.1.6.1 General The criteria used by the pr evious report for gauging the strength of the evidence wer enot identical to the criteria used for this Report. In particular, a judgement of 'convinc- ing' causal association was not conditional on supportive evi - dence from prospective studies. This Report does make that requirement. It also emphasises the special importance ofrandomised contr olled trials when applied appr opriately , especially where the results are positive. In these respects, the criteria used for this Report are more stringent. See box3.8 in chapter 3. 7.1.6.2 Specific The pr evious r eport separated cancers of the mouth and pharynx fr om cancer of the larynx. The panel responsible for the previous report judged the evidence that vegetables and fruits protect against cancers of the mouth and pharynx tobe convincing. It also judged that these foods pr obably pro- tect against cancer of the larynx. Vitamin C was judged to be possibly pr otective against cancers of the mouth and lar - ynx. Ther eis still little information fr om cohort studies, which weakens the evidence base. Evidence accumulated since the mid-1990s confirms the previous judgement that the evidence that alcoholic drinks are a cause of oral cancers is convincing. And in the previ- ous report, the evidence that mat\u00e9 is a cause of oral cancerswas judged possible for cancers of the mouth and pharynx. 7.1.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The evidence that alcoholic drinks ar eacause of cancers ofthe mouth, pharynx, and larynx is convincing. The risk is multiplied when drinkers of alcohol also smoke tobacco. Non-starchy vegetables, fruits, and foods containing carotenoids probably protect against these cancers. There is limited evidence suggesting that mat\u00e9, a herbal infusion, when drunk scalding hot through a metal straw, as istraditional in some parts of South America, is a cause of oral cancer. The main cause of these cancers is smoking and other use of and exposure to tobacco. 250PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 7.2 Nasopharynx Cancer of the nasopharynx is the 23rd most common type of cancer worldwide. About 8 0000 cases were recorded in 2002, accounting for less than 1 per cent overall. In most parts of the world, this cancer is rare. It is relativelycommon on and near the southern Chinese littoral, andamong communities who have migrated from that part ofChina to other countries. It is twice as common in men as in women. It is the 20th most common cause of death from cancer. Overall, the Panel judges that there is a specific role for Cantonese-style salted fish in the causation of cancer ofthe nasopharynx. The Panel judges as follows: Cantonese-style salted fish is probably a cause ofnasopharyngeal cancer .This judgement does not apply to fish salted or fermented by any other method. Thereis limited evidence suggesting that non-star chy vegetables and fruits protect against this cancer. Other causes of this cancer include tobacco smoking and infection with the Epstein-Barr virus. In final summary, the strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\", shows thatCantonese-style salted fish is a pr obable cause of this cancer . The nasopharynx is the top portion of the pharynx, the mus- cular cavity leading from the nose and mouth to the larynx. Cancers in this ar ea arise pr edominantly fr om epithelial cells, with squamous cell carcinomas being the most com- mon. Carcinomas constitute 75-90 per cent of nasopharyn-geal cancers in low-risk populations, and virtually 100 percent in high-risk populations. 25Nasopharyngeal squamous cell car cinomas are included here; other types are not. 7.2.1 Trends, incidence, and survival Age-adjusted rates of nasophar yngeal cancer are decreasing in areas of high incidence, such as Hong Kong and Singapor e.25 This cancer is pr edominantly a disease of low-income countries, with overall rates more than three times higher in middle- to low- than in high-income countries. Incidence isalso higher in certain ethnic gr oups \u2014 for instance Chinese and also Malay and Filipino people living in south-eastern Asia. Around the world, age-adjusted incidence rates range from 20-30 per 100 000 people in parts of Hong Kong and south-eastern Asia, to less than 1 per 10 0 000 across most of the Americas and Eur ope. This cancer also occurs in northern Africa, parts of the Middle East, and Micronesia and Polynesia. However, thehighest rates ar eamong Cantonese people who live in thecentral region of Guangdong Province in southern China, which includes Hong Kong. 25Migrant populations from this province carry the risk levels of the original population, but this decreases over generations.26Rates are approximately twice as high in men as in women .2 The age pr ofile of nasophar yngeal cancer is differ ent in areas of high compared with low incidence. Risk increases with age in most of the world, but in Guangdong Provinceit peaks between the ages of 45 and 54. In populations where there is a moderate incidence of this cancer, risk peaks in young adults. 25Overall 5-year survival rates are around 50 per cent.27Also see box 7.1.1. There are two variants of cell carcinoma: keratinising and non-keratinising. The non-ker- atinising variant can be further divided into differ entiated or undifferentiated. In North America, the proportions of each are 25, 12, and 63 per cent, respectively. In southernChina, the distribution is differ ent: 2, 3, and 95 per cent. 27 FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE NASOPHARYNX In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the nasopharynx. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence. DECREASES RISK INCREASES RISK Convincing Probable Cantonese-style salted fish1 Limited \u2014 Non-starchy vegetables2 suggestiveFruits2 Limited \u2014 Cereals (grains) and their products; and seeds; noconclusion herbs, spices, fermented tofu and soya products Substantial effect on risk None identified unlikely 1This style of pr eparation is characterised by treatment with less salt than typically used, and fermentation during the drying process due to relatively high outdoor temperature and moisture levels. This conclusion does notapply to fish pr epar ed (or salted) by other means. 2 Judgements on vegetables and fruits do not include those preserved by salting and/or pickling. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossar y. 251CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.2.2 Pathogenesis Variation in the distribution of keratinising squamous cell carcinoma and the two forms of non-keratinising carcinoma in North America and southern China, together with the dif - ferent age profiles in the two regions, suggests that differ- ent disease paths may occur in high-incidence populations. Patches of dysplasia are the first recognisable precancer- ous lesions; latent infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (seebox7.2.1) leads to sever edysplasia. The subsequent genet - ic and chromosomal changes in these lesions lead to inva- sive carcinoma. 28 7.2.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) Tobacco use .Smoking tobacco is a cause of nasopharyngeal cancer . Occupational exposur e.Occupational exposur eto formalde - hyde is also a cause of this cancer .33-35 Infectious agents .Epstein-Barr virus infection is a cause of nasophar yngeal cancer (see bo x7.2.1).30It may be neces - sary but is not a sufficient cause. 7.2.4 Interpretation of the evidence 7.2.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2,3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio of to cancer of the nasopharynx and to Cantonese-style salted fish, include: Classification .The term 'salted' is an incomplete and perhaps misleading term, given that the fish is also fermented. See the footnote of the matrix for this section, and also 7.2.5.3. Confounding .It is not possible to exclude a genetic compo- nent. Those at highest risk are Cantonese-speaking commu-nities living in or originally from Guangdong Province. Production, preservation, processing, preparation .The method of salting or the type of fish salted varies between regions. The presence of nitrates and nitrosamines (see box4.3.2) in the fish also varies. 7.2.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 74 publications were included in the SLR for nasopharyngeal cancer. Fuller summaries of the epidemio-logical, experimental, and mechanistic evidence are to befound in Chapters 4-6. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.2.5.1 Non-starchy vegetables (Also see chapter 4.2.5.1.) Five case-contr ol studies and two ecological studies investi - gated non-starchy vegetables; a further four case-control studies investigated green vegetables. Preserved vegetableswere excluded from all categories. Nearly all of the studiesshowed decreased risk with increased intake. This is a wide and disparate categor y, and many different plant food constituents ar erepresented that could contribute to a pr otective effect of non-star chy vegetables. ee radicals cules, pr otecting against o xidation damage. It is difficult to unravel the relative importance of each constituent and it is likely that any protective effect may result from acombination of influences on several pathways involved in carcinogenesis. The evidence on non-starchy vegetables is sparse but generally consistent. There is limited evidencesuggesting that non-star chy vegetables protect against nasopharyngeal cancer . 7.2.5.2 Fruits (Also see chapter 4.2.5.2.) Most adults are infected with the Epstein-Barr virus, but rela- tively few will ever develop the cancers of which this virus is a contributory or necessary cause. Other factors beyond infection with the virus are needed to lead to the development of can-cer. Environmental factors including some dietary factors arethought to render precancerous epithelial cells sensitive to Epstein-Barr virus infection, which then triggers malignancy. 29 Epstein-Barr virus is a DNA virus of the herpes family. It pri- marily infects B lymphocytes (white blood cells that produce antibodies), though it can also infect epithelial cells. Infection usually occurs in childhood and does not usually produce symp-toms, but in adults it can cause infectious mononucleosis or glan- dular fever. It is particularly associated with undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the most prevalent type. 30 31 In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, all of the tumour cells carry viral DNA in a monoclonal form. This means that Epstein-Barr virus infection must have occurred quite early in the cancerprocess, before rapid growth. 32It is not normally possible to detect Epstein-Barr non-cancerous nasopha- ryngeal 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Six case-control studies investigated general fruits and a further five case-control studies investigated citrus fruits. Preserved fruits were excluded from all categories. Most of the studies for general fruits and all of the studies for citrusfruits showed a decreased risk. This is a wide and disparate category, and many different plant food constituents are represented that could contribute to a protective effect of fruits. These include dietary are potentially antioxidants. Antioxidants trap free radicals and reactive oxygen molecules, protecting against oxidation dam- age. It is difficult to unravel the relative importance of eachconstituent and likely that a protective effect may result fromacombination of influences on several pathways involved in carcinogenesis. In addition, some components of citrus fruits have been shown directly to inhibit Epstein-Barr virus acti- vation. 36 Theevidence, from case-control studies only, is sparse. Thereis limited evidence suggesting that fruits pr otect against nasopharyngeal cancer. 7.2.5.3 Cantonese-style salted fish (Also see chapter 4.3.5.3.1.) One cohort study and 21 case-control studies of adult dietswereexamined. The single cohort study and most of the case-contr ol studies showed incr eased risk with higher intake. Meta-analysis showed a 28 per cent increased risk per time eaten per week (figur e4.3.9). Ther eis some heter o- geneity, not all readily explained. Childhood diet data impli- cate an increased risk with early-life exposure. Cantonese-style salted fish is dried in natural conditions outdoors. As prepared on the southern Chinese littoral, it ischaracterised by treatment with less salt than used on thenorthern littoral; it is also subject to fermentation during thedrying process in the warm, damp climate of southern China. The high content of nitrate and nitr osamines may account for some of the incr eased risk associated with salted fish intak e. Nitr osamines are known mutagens and animal car- cinogens that induce gene mutation. The direct role of nitrosamines in the carcinogenic process is supported by theincreased risk for nasopharyngeal cancer development in people who have a variant allele of CYP2E1. This enzyme is expressed in the nasophar ynx and is involved in the meta- bolic activation of nitr osamines to car cinogenic adducts. 37 Additional evidence has suggested a component of salted fish may contain Epstein-Barr virus-activating substances,although the specific agents of action have not been identified. 38 Evidence from several case-control studies is consistent and shows a dose-response effect. There isevidence for plausible mechanisms. Cantonese-stylesalted fish is pr obably a cause of nasopharyngeal cancer. 7.2.5.4 Other exposures Other exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number of studies too few to allow conclusions to be reached. Thesewere as follows: cereals (grains) and their products; nuts and seeds; meat; Comparison with previous report 7.2.6.1 General See 7.1.6.1, and box 3.8. 7.2.6.2 Specific The previous report judged the evidence that Cantonese-style salted fish is a cause of nasophar yngeal cancer to be con - vincing. No further cohort studies have been conducted since the mid-1990s. 7.2.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : Cantonese-style salted fish is pr obably a cause of nasopha- ryngeal cancer .This does not apply to fish salted or fermented by any other method. Thereis limited evidence suggesting that non-star chy vegetables, and also fruits, protect against this cancer. 253CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.3 Oesophagus Cancer of the oesophagus is the eighth most common type of cancer worldwide. Around 460 000 cases occurred in2002, accounting for over 4 per cent overall. There are two common types of oesophageal cancer, adenocarcinomaand squamous cell carcinoma, which have differentpatterns of occurrence. In general this cancer is notincreasing, except for adenocarcinomas, which are increasing in high-income countries. Oesophageal cancer is twice as common in men as in women. It is usually fataland is the sixth most common cause of death from cancer. Overall, the Panel judges that food and nutrition and body fatness play an important role in the prevention andcausation of cancer of the oesophagus. The Panel judges as follows: The evidence that alcoholic drinks ar eacause of cancer of the oesophagus is convincing. The risk is multiplied whendrink ers of alcohol also smok etobacco. The evidence that greater body fatness is a cause of oesophageal adenocarcinoma is also convincing. Mat\u00e9, a herbalinfusion, when drunk scalding hot through a metal straw,as is traditional in parts of South America, is probably acause of this cancer. Non-star chy vegetables, fruits, and foods containing beta-car otene and/or vitamin C pr obably protect against oesophageal cancer. Thereis limited evidence suggesting that foods containing dietary fibre, folate, pyridoxine, or vitamin Eprotect against this cancer, and that red meat, processedmeat, and high-temperatur edrinks ar ecauses of this cancer. See chapter 8 for evidence and judgements on factors that modify the risk of body fatness, including physicalactivity and sedentary ways of life, the energy density offoods and drinks, and br eastfeeding. Other causes of this cancer include smoking tobacco and chewing betel quid. It has been estimated that most casesof oesophageal cancer are preventable by appropriate dietsand associated factors, together with not smoking. In final summary ,the strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\", shows that alcoholic drinks and body fatness ar eacause of this cancer (adenocar cinoma only); that non-star chy vegetables, fruits, and foods containing beta-carotene and/or vitamin C are probably protective; and that mat\u00e9, as traditionally drunk in parts of South America, is probably a cause of this cancer. The oesophagus is the muscular tube through which food passes fr om the pharynx to the stomach. The oesophagus is lined over most of its length by squa - mous epithelial cells, where squamous cell carcinomas occur. The portion just above the gastric junction (where theoesophagus meets the stomach) is lined by columnar FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE OESOPHAGUS Inthe judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the oesophagus. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence.

Dietary fibre is contained in plant foods (see box 4.1.2 and chapter 4.2). 4 As drunk traditionally in parts of South America, scalding hot through a metal straw. Any increased risk of cancer is judged to be caused by epithelial damage r esulting fr om the heat, and not by the herb itself. 5 Vitamin B6. 6 The term 'red meat' refers to beef, pork, lamb, and goat from domesticated animals. 7 The term 'processed meat' refers to meats preserved by smoking, curing, or salting, or addition of chemical preservatives. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossar y. 254PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS epithelial cells, from which adenocarcinomas can develop.4 Adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus shows similarities with adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia (see 7.5). Each type accounts for around half of all cases and both types areincluded in this Report. 7.3.1 Trends, incidence, and survival Age-adjusted rates of oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas are generally declining, although in some high-income regions, overall rates of oesophageal cancer are increasing. For instance, the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma is rising rapidly in Europe and North America.39In the USA, adenocarcinomas in white men increased fivefold between1974 and the end of the 20th century, making it the fastestincreasing cancer studied in that country. 40 Oesophageal cancer is, however, mainly a disease of low- income countries, occurring around four times more com-monly in low- to middle- than in high-income countries. Around the world, age-adjusted incidence rates range frommorethan 20 per 10 0000 people in parts of eastern and southern Africa and eastern and south-central Asia to less than 5 per 100 000 in northern, western, and middle Africa,Central America, and south-eastern Asia. Localised peaks inincidence have been reported to exceed 100 per 100 000. Forinstance, in rural Linxian, China, oesophageal cancer is theleading cause of death. 41In the US A, rates are higher among African-American people than in white people. W orldwide, rates are higher in men than in women, by around five to two.Inmost populations, risk incr eases with age, with few cases diagnosed in people under 40. Oesophageal cancer does not usually produce symptoms at the early stages, so the disease is generally at an advancedstage when diagnosed. Survival rates are poor: around 10per cent at 5 years. 36This type of cancer accounts for a lit- tle over 4 per cent of all cancer incidence, but almost 6 percent of all cancer deaths worldwide. Also see box 7.1.1. 7.3.2 Pathogenesis The epithelial cells lining the oesophagus are exposed direct- ly to car cinogens in food. Repeated exposures, for instance, to burns from very high-temperature drinks or irritation from the dir ect action of alcohol, may cause inflammation . The r ole of irritation and inflammation in the development of oesophageal cancer is supported by the finding that gas- tro-oesophageal reflux (where stomach acid flows upwardsto the oesophagus) incr eases the risk of adenocar cinomas by as much as 40-fold. 42Barrett's oesophagus is a probable intermediate stage between gastro-oesophageal acquir which squamous cells are replaced by columnar epithelial cells; autopsy studies sug - gest that it usually remains undiagnosed.44The increasing use of endoscopes to investigate abdominal symptoms hasresulted in the earlier detection of a small pr oportion of ade -nocarcinomas in people with Barrett's oesophagus. 4 Some people have an abnormally strong lower oesophageal sphincter (a condition called oesophageal achalasia), which means swallowed food is retained in theoesophagus. It causes a 15-fold increase in the risk of squa- mous cell carcinomas, which may be due to chronic irrita- tion of the lining of the oesophagus or its increased contact with food-borne carcinogens. 4546 Tylosis A is the late-onset, inherited familial disease where the outer horny layer of the skin thickens, affecting the palms and soles (hyperkeratosis). Palmar and plantar hyperker- atosis is the single proven genetic abnormality associated with a 25 per cent lifetime incidence of squamous cell can- cer of the oesophagus.47 7.3.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) Other diseases .Gastric reflux and oesophageal achalasia both incr ease the risk of ,and thus can be seen as a cause of , this cancer. Barrett's oesophagus can be seen as a precan- cerous condition. Tobacco use .Smoking is a cause both of oesophageal squa- mous cell carcinoma and of adenocarcinomas, increasing therisk appr oximately twofold. 10 39Smoking is estimated to cause ar ound 40 per cent of all cases. Chewing betel quid (on its own and also with tobacco quid) is also a cause of oesophageal cancers.11 Infectious agents .HPV (see box 7.13.1) is also a cause of this cancer ,and is estimated to be a cause of almost 25 per cent of squamous cell carcinomas. Like other infectious agents, it may be a necessary cause but is not a sufficient cause. It mayalso play a role in the divergent geographical distributionsof this cancer. 48 7.3.4 Interpr etation of the evidence 7.3.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this R eport to denote ratio mea - to cancer of the oesophagus include: Classification .There are different types of oesophageal can- cer.Squamous cell carcinomas have different geographical and time tr ends fr om adenocar cinomas. Each follows a dif - ferent disease path, and may have different associated risk factors. However, there were only sufficient data to conductseparate analyses for body fatness. Ther eforethe ratio of 255CHAPTER 7 CANCERS squamous cell carcinomas to adenocarcinomas in each study is a potential cause of heterogeneity in all other summaries. The oesophageal-gastric junction and gastric cardia are also lined with columnar epithelial cells. Cancers in these areasare often grouped with oesophageal cancers, although they may also be classed as stomach cancers (see 7.5). 4Different approaches or definitions in different studies are another potential source of heterogeneity. Confounding .Smoking is the main single cause of this can- cer. High-quality studies adjust for smoking. 7.3.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 262 publications were included in the SLR for oesophageal cancer. Fuller summaries of the epidemiologi- cal, experimental, and mechanistic evidence are to be found in Chapters 4-6. Thefull SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.3.5.1 Foods containing dietary fibre (Also see chapter 4.1.5.3.) One cohort study, nine case-control studies, and two eco-logical studies investigated dietary fibre. Most were sugges-tive of a relationship with decreased oesophageal cancerincidence. Data come pr edominantly from dietary sources, not supplements; ther eforenospecific effect can be attrib- uted specifically to dietary fibre itself, which is interpreted simply as a mark er of consumption of foods containing it. It is not clear whether there is an as yet unknown mech- anism through which dietary fibre could exert a direct effecton oesophageal cancer ,or whether the effect is mediated through other constituents of the foods (such as cereals (grains), vegetables, and fruits) that contain dietary fibre. There is limited evidence, from sparse and inconsistent case-contr ol studies only, suggesting that foods containing dietary fibr eprotect against oesophageal cancer . 7.3.5.2 Non-starchy vegetables (Also chapter 4.2.5.1.) Atotal of 5 cohort studies, 37 case-control studies, and 6 eco- logical studies investigated non-star chy vegetables. Other groupings examined wer evegetable and fruit consumption (combined) (8 case-control), raw vegetables (16 case-con- trol), cruciferous vegetables (1 cohort, 5 case-control), alli-um vegetables (1 cohort, 8 case-contr ol), gr een,leafy vegetables (1 cohort, 11 case-control), and tomatoes (1 cohort, 9 case-control). All of the studies of raw vegetablesand most of the other studies showed decreased risk with increased intake. Meta-analysis of case-control data showed a31 per cent decr eased risk per 50 g of raw vegetables per day (figur es 4.2.6 and 4.2.7). Raw vegetables have a mor e consistent definition than non-starchy vegetables, which may include preserved vegetables and a variety of cooking meth-ods, leading to incr eased heter ogeneity .This is a wide and disparate category, and many different plant food constituents are represented that could contribute to a protective effect of non-starchy vegetables. These are Antioxidants trap free radicals and reactive oxygen mole- cules, protecting against oxidation damage. It is difficult tounravel the relative importance of each constituent and it is likely that any protective effect may result from a combina- tion of influences on several pathways involved in carcino- genesis. There is more evidence, including on vegetable subtypes, from case-control studies than from cohortstudies, but both are moderately consistent, and there is some evidence for a dose-response relationship. There is evidence for plausible mechanisms (seechapter 4.2.5.1). Non-star chy vegetables pr obably protect against oesophageal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort49and two case-control studies1750have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement.Also see box 3.8. 7.3.5.3 Fr uits (Also see chapter 4.2.5.2.) Atotal of 4 cohort studies, 36 case-control studies, and 7 ecological studies investigated fruits; and 1 cohort study ,16 case-control studies, and 1 ecological study investigated cit- rus fruits. All of the cohort studies and most of the otherstudies showed decr eased risk with incr eased intak e. Meta- analysis of case-control data showed a 22 per cent decreased risk per 50 g of fruit per day, and 30 per cent decreased riskper 50 g of citrus fruit per day (figures 4.2.22 and 4.2.24).Adose-response relationship was apparent. Heterogeneity could not be fully explained. Fruits ar esources of vitamin C and other antioxidants, such as car otenoids, phenols, and flavonoids, as well as other potentially bioactive phytochemicals. Antioxidants trap free radicals and reactive oxygen molecules, protecting againstoxidation damage. It is difficult to unravel the relative importance of each constituent and it is lik ely that any pr otective effect may result fr om a combination of influences on several pathways involved in carcinogenesis. The evidence, including that on fruit subtypes, though mostly from case-control studies, is consistent, with a dose-response relationship. There is evidence for plausible mechanisms. Fruits probably protect againstoesophageal cancer. The P anel is awar ethat since the of the SLR ,one cohort49and two case-control studies50 51have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement.Also see bo x3.8. 256PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 7.3.5.4 Foods containing folate (Also see chapter 4.2.5.4.) Eight case-control studies investigated dietary folate and two case-control studies investigated red-cell and plasma folate.All studies showed a relationship with decreased cancer inci- dence. Data come predominantly from dietary sources, not supplements; therefore no effect can be attributed to folate separate from foods. Folate plays an important role in the synthesis, repair, and methylation of DNA. Abnormal DNA methylation has been linked to aberrant gene expression and to cancers at sever- al sites. Folate may also reduce HPV proliferation in cells. Theevidence, from case-control studies only, is sparse. There is limited evidence suggesting that folateprotects against oesophageal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-control study52has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see bo x3.8. 7.3.5.5 Foods containing pyridoxine (vitamin B6) (Also see chapter 4.2.5.5.) Six case-control studies investigated foods containing pyri-doxine and oesophageal cancer. All six studies showed a relationship between pyridoxine consumption and reduced risk of oesophageal cancer, withnone r eporting contrary results. Together with folate and cobalamin (vitamin B12), vita - min B6 is involved in one-carbon metabolism and is impor- tant for DNA synthesis, r epair ,and methylation from case-control studies only, was sparse. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting that pyridoxine protects against oesophageal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-control study52has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.3.5.6 Foods containing vitamin C (Also see chapter 4.2.5.6.) One cohort study, 19 case-control studies, and 3 ecologicalstudies investigated vitamin C. The single cohort study and nearly all of the case-control studies showed decreased risk with incr eased intak e. Vitamin C traps fr ee radicals and r eactive o xygen mole - cules, protecting DNA from mutagenic attack, protecting against lipid peroxidation, reducing nitrates, and stimulat-ing the immune system. Asubstantial amount of consistent evidence is available, both from cohort and from case-controlstudies. Foods containing vitamin C probably protectagainst oesophageal cancer . The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-control study53has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see bo x3.8.7.3.5.7 Foods containing vitamin E (Also see chapter 4.2.5.7.) One cohort study, nine case-control studies, and one eco- logical study investigated dietary vitamin E; three cohortstudies and four case-control studies investigated serum vit- amin E. All cohort studies and most case-control studies showed decreased risk with increased intake; serum case- control data were inconsistent. Vitamin E is a family of eight compounds collectively referred to as tocopherols. They can act as antioxidants and free radical scavengers; however, few animal studies support an anti-cancer effect. Much of the evidence on vitamin E, mostly from case- control studies, was of poor quality. There is limitedevidence suggesting that foods containing vitamin Eprotect against oesophageal cancer. 7.3.5.8 Foods containing beta-carotene (Also see chapter 4.2.5.3.) Ten case-control studies investigated dietary beta-carotene;three cohort studies and one case-contr ol study investigat - ed serum beta-carotene; and one cohort study and three case-control studies investigated dietary pro-vitamin Acarotenoids. Most of these studies showed a relationship with decreased risk. Data come predominantly from dietary sources, not sup- plements; ther efore no effect can be attributed to carotenoids separate fr om foods. Carotenoids are antioxidants, which can prevent lipid oxi- dation and related o xidative str ess. Some, beta- carotene, are also pro-vitamin A carotenoids. Thereis a substantial amount of consistent evidence available from both cohort and case-control studies.Foods containing beta-carotene probably protectagainst oesophageal cancer. 7.3.5.9 Red meat (Also see chapter 4.3.5.1.1.) Twelve case-contr ol studies investigated red meat. Most were suggestive of increased risk. There are several potential underlying mechanisms for a positive association of r ed meat consumption with oesophageal cancer, including the generation of potentially carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds (see bo x4.3.2). Some meats ar ealso cook ed at high temperatur es, resulting in the production of heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (see box 4.3.4). Red meat contains haem iron.Free iron can lead to the pr oduction of free radicals (see box 4.3.3). There is limited evidence, from case-control studies, some of which were poor quality, suggesting that redmeat is a cause of oesophageal cancer . The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study54has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see bo x3.8. 257CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.3.5.10 Processed meat (Also see chapter 4.3.5.1.2.) Two cohort studies and eight case-control studies investi- gated processed meat. Both cohort studies were suggestiveof increased risk; case-control data were inconsistent. The definition of processed meat varies (see box 4.3.1), which may increase heterogeneity. Nitrates are produced endogenously in gastric acid and are added as preservatives to processed meats (see box 4.3.2).This may contribute to production of N-nitroso compounds and increased exposure. These compounds are suspected mutagens and carcinogens.55 Many processed meats also contain high levels of salt and nitrite. Meats cooked at high temperatures can contain het-erocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (seebox 4.3.4). Haem promotes the formation of N-nitroso com- pounds and also contains iron. Free iron can lead to the pro- duction of free radicals (see box 4.3.3). Thereis limited evidence, mostly fr om case-contr ol studies, suggesting that processed meat is a cause of oesophageal cancer . The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study54has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.3.5.11 Mat\u00e9 (Also see chapter 4.7.5.6.1.) Eight case-control studies and one ecological study investi-gated mat\u00e9. Most wer esuggestive of an incr eased incidence with higher mat\u00e9 consumption. Meta-analysis of case- control data showed a 16 per cent increased risk per cup/day (figur e4.7.5). A dose-r esponse r elationship was apparent. There is some biological plausibility. Mat\u00e9 is a tea-like beverage typically drunk very hot through a metal straw. This produces heat damage in the oesophagus. Repeateddamage of this natur ecan lead to cancer (see chapter 2.4.1.3). Chemical car cinogenesis fr om constituents of mat\u00e9 has also been postulated. 19 20 The evidence from case-control studies is consistent and a dose-r esponse relationship is apparent. There is robust evidence for plausible mechanisms. Regular consumption of mat\u00e9, as drunk in the traditional stylein South America, is a pr obable cause of oesophageal cancer. 7.3.5.12 High-temperatur efoods and drinks (Also see chapter 4.7.5.7.) Three cohort studies and 15 case-control studies investigat-ed high-temperature foods and drinks. Most were suggestive of a relationship between them and increased incidence of oesophageal cancer but many wer einadequately adjusted for alcohol and smoking. High-temperature foods and drinks can produce heat dam- age in the oesophagus. Repeated damage of this nature canpredispose to the development of oesophageal cancer .The evidence is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that high-temperature drinks are a cause ofoesophageal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two case-control studies50 51have been published. This new infor- mation does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.3.5.13 Alcoholic drinks (Also see chapter 4.8.5.1.) Eight cohort studies, 56 case-control studies, and 10 eco- logical studies investigated alcoholic drinks. Most studies showed a relationship between increased consumption and increased cancer incidence. Meta-analysis of case-controldata showed a 4 per cent increased risk per drink/week (fig-ure 4.8.6). A dose-response relationship is apparent fromcase-control data, with no clear threshold. It is biologically highly plausible that alcoholic drinks are acause of oesophageal cancer. Reactive metabolites of alco- hol such as acetaldehyde can be car cinogenic. T obacco may induce specific mutations in DNA that are less efficiently repair ed in the pr esence of alcohol. Alcohol may also func - tion as a solvent, enhancing penetration of other carcino- genic molecules into mucosal cells. Additionally, the effectsofalcohol may be mediated through the production of prostaglandins, lipid peroxidation, and the generation of freeradical oxygen species. Lastly, heavy consumers of alcoholmay have diets low in essential nutrients, making tissues sus - ceptible to car cinogenesis. Thereis ample and consistent evidence, both fr om cohort and case-control studies, with a dose-response relationship. There is robust evidence for mechanismsoperating in humans. The evidence that alcoholicdrinks are a cause of oesophageal cancer is convincing.No threshold was identified. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort56and four case-contr ol studies50 51 53 57have been pub - lished. This new information does not change the P anel judge - ment. Also see bo x3.8. 7.3.5.14 Body fatness (Also see chapter 6.1.3.1.) Asufficient number studies investigated to allow car cinomas and adenocar cinomas to be analysed .While wer einconsistent for squa - mous cell carcinomas and for all cancers, adenocarcinomas, when analysed separately, showed a con-sistent incr eased risk with gr eater BMI. Thr ee cohort stud - ies and eight case-control studies investigated body fatness, as measured by BMI and adenocarcinomas. All of the cohortstudies and most of the case-control studies showed increased risk with increased BMI. Meta-analysis of case-con- trol data showed a 55 per cent increased risk per 5 kg/m 2 (figur e6.1.2). A dose-r esponse r elationship is appar ent. This is consistent with known geographical and time trends for both BMI and adenocarcinomas. It is biologically plausible that body fatness is a cause of 258PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS oesophageal cancer. High body fatness is associated with increased gastro-oesophageal reflux and Barrett's oesopha- gus. It also directly affects levels of many circulating hor- mones, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors, andoestrogens, creating an environment that encourages car- cinogenesis and discourages apoptosis (see box 2.4) Body fatness stimulates the body's inflammatory response, which may contribute to the initiation and progression of several cancers (see chapter 2.4.1.3). The epidemiology is consistent with evidence of a dose-response relationship. There is evidence for plausible mechanisms that operate in humans. Theevidence that greater body fatness is a cause ofoesophageal adenocarcinoma is convincing. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort58 59and five case-control studies51 53 60-62have been pub- lished. This new information does not change the Panel judge-ment. Also see bo x3.8. 7.3.5.15 Other exposur es Other exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either too sparse, too inconsistent, or the number of studiestoo few to allow conclusions to be reached. These were asfollows: cereals (grains) or their products; 7.3.6 Comparison with pr evious report 7.3.6.1 General See section 7.1.6.1 of this chapter, and box 3.8 in chapter 3. 7.3.6.2 Specific The previous report judged the evidence that vegetables and fruits pr otect against oesophageal cancer to be convincing. Data published since then have been somewhat less consis - tent. At the time of the previous report, the evidence on body fatness was unclear ,because data on adenocar cinomas was inadequate and not analysed separately. Theprevious report judged it possible that carotenoids or vitamin C protect against this cancer. The evidence base for foods containing these nutrients is now stronger. The previ- ous r eport judged it possible that mat\u00e9 and other very hot drinks cause oesophageal cancer .The evidence on mat\u00e9 is now stronger.7.3.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The evidence that alcoholic drinks and body fatness (ade-nocarcinomas only) are causes of cancer of the oesophagus is convincing. The risk is multiplied when drinkers of alco- hol also smoke tobacco. Non-starchy vegetables, fruits, and foods containing beta- carotene and/or vitamin C probably protect againstoesophageal cancer. Mat\u00e9, a herbal infusion, when drunk scalding hot through ametal straw as is traditional in South America, is probably acause of this cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that foods contain- ing dietary fibre, folate, pyridoxine, or vitamin E protectagainst this cancer; and that red meat, processed meat, andhigh temperature drinks are causes of this cancer. 259CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.4 Lung Cancer of the lung is the most common type of cancer worldwide (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer). Around1.4 million cases were recorded in 2002, accounting for over 12 per cent of all cancers. Three-quarters of all casesoccur in men. The disease is most common in high-incomecountries and is increasing in some low-income countriessuch as China. It is almost always fatal, and is the chief cause of death from cancer: nearly 18 per cent of all deaths from cancer are from this type. Overall, the Panel emphasises that the principal cause of lung cancer is smoking tobacco. The Panel judges as follows: The evidence that arsenic in drinking water and (in smokers only) pharmacological doses of beta-carotene areacause of this cancer is convincing. Fruits, and also foods containing carotenoids, probably protect against lung cancer . There is limited evidence suggesting that non-starchy vegetables, selenium and foods containing it, foodscontaining quercetin, and physical activity protect againstlung cancer. There is also limited evidence suggesting that red meat, processed meat, total fat, butter, pharmacological doses of retinol (smok ers only), and low body fatness are causes of lung cancer. In final summary ,the str ongest evidence, corr esponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\", shows that arsenic in drinking water and pharmacological doses ofbeta-car otene (smok ers only) ar ecauses of lung cancer ; and that fruits and foods containing carotenoids probably protect against this cancer. The lungs ar epart of the aerodigestive system. They contain hundr eds of lobules, and each lobule contains a br onchiole, its branches, and clusters of alveoli. This is wher ecarbon dioxide (a product of respiration) is removed from the blood and replaced with oxygen, to fuel further respiration, pro-ducing ener gy. About 90-95 per cent of lung cancers are either small-cell carcinoma or non-small-cell car cinoma. The latter has three subtypes: adenocar cent, adenocarcinomas 30-45 per cent, andlarge-cell car cinomas about 9 per cent of all lung cancers. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 10-15 per cent of all lung cancers; this form is considered a distinct clinicalpathological entity due to its characteristic aggressive biol- ogy, diffuse nature, propensity for early metastasis, and over- all poor pr ognosis. Mesothelioma, which affects the pleura (layer of cells covering the lung and chest cavity), is almostalways caused by previous exposure to asbestos. FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE LUNG Inthe judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the lung. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence.

The grading for this entry applies specifically to inorganic arsenic in drinking water. 2 The evidence is derived from studies using high-dose supplements (20 mg/day for beta-carotene; 25 000 international units/day for retinol) in smokers. 3 Judgements on vegetables and fruits do not include those preserved by salting and/or pickling. 4 Includes both foods naturally containing the constituent and foods which have the constituent added (see chapter 3.5.3). 5 The evidence is derived from studies using supplements at a dose of 200 \u00b5g/day. 6 Physical activity of all types: occupational, household, transport, and recreational. 7The ter m'red meat' r efers to beef, pork, lamb, and goat from domesticated animals. 8 The term 'processed meat' refers to meats preserved by smoking, curing, or salting, or addition of chemical preservatives. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. 260PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 7.4.1 Trends, incidence, and survival Smoking and other exposure to tobacco smoke are the prin- cipal causes of lung cancer. The trend and incidence patternsare explained largely by these exposures. Age-adjusted rates of lung cancer are decreasing in many high-income countries dueto decreased smoking. Global and regional trends in inci- dence have mirrored the prevalence of smoking, with a time lag of around 35 years. 63Lung cancer was rare until the end of the 19th century, with only 140 cases reported in the world literature before 1898, and only 374 by 1912.63 Incidence peaked in most high-income countries in the sec- ond half of the 20th century, and later for women than men. Therelative incidence of the various types of lung cancer is gradually changing. Between 1980 and 2000, the pro-portion of squamous cancers decreased as the proportion ofadenocarcinomas increased, possibly due to changes in smoking habits or products. 64Adenocarcinoma is now the most frequently diagnosed type in the USA and Japan; whileit is also showing signs of incr easing in Eur ope, squamous cell carcinoma continues to be the predominant type. Lung cancer is mainly a disease of high-income countries, where the smoking epidemic began earlier, and overall rates are nearly double those in middle- to low-income countries.Around the world, age-adjusted incidence ranges from morethan 60 per 100 000 people in North America and acrossmuch of Europe, to less than 5 per 100 000 in much of mid-dle Africa. W ithin Europe, rates are highest in eastern European countries. In the US A, rates are higher among African-American people than in white people. Worldwide, rates ar ehigher in men than in women ,by ar ound thr ee to one. The incidence of lung cancer increases with age. Rates will continue to rise in middle- and low-income countries astobacco smoking incr eases. The early stages of lung cancer do not usually produce symp- toms, so the disease is generally at an advanced stage when itis diagnosed. Survival rates are poor, around 10 per cent at 5years, and are usually higher in women than men. 36SCLC has a worse pr ognosis than non-SCLC (a survival rate of only around 5 per cent at 5 years), because SCLC has a tenden - cy to metastasise (spr ead) early ,and surgery is not usually successful.465Lung cancer accounts for somewhat over 12 per cent of all cancer incidence, but for nearly 18 per centof all cancer deaths. Also see bo x7.1.1. 7.4.2 Pathogenesis Carcinogens in tobacco smoke, or other inhaled particles such as coal tar or asbestos, can interact dir ectly with the DNA of lung cells. Because the whole lung is exposed to inhaled carcinogens, several sites may accumulate differentcancerous changes, leading to multiple cancers originating in different types of cell. 4 Inflammation may also play a r ole in the development of lung cancer ,with cancer ous changes occurring as a r esponse to chronic exposure to irritants and repeated injury. Columnar epithelial cells are replaced with stratified squa-mous epithelial cells, which may also incr ease cancer risk.The division of these new cells increases, and this eventual- ly is followed by dysplasia of the lung mucosa. When this process involves the full thickness of the mucosa, these dys- plastic lesions become carcinoma in situ. Further invasion tothe depth of the basement membrane, and the subsequent infiltration of the underlying stroma by malignant cells, sig- nals invasive cancer. This process may take 10-20 years. 4 People with adenocarcinomas may have an associated his- tory of chronic lung disease, such as scleroderma, rheuma-toid disease, sarcoidosis, or tuberculosis. 4 7.4.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and section 7.1.3.1.) Tobacco use .Smoking is the principal cause of lung cancer; it is estimated to be responsible for 85 per cent of all types of this cancer.66In populations with a history of long-term cigarette use, the pr oportion has r eached 90 per cent.10Involuntar y exposure to tobacco smoke ('passive smoking') is also a cause of lung cancer ,including in people who have never smok ed.10 Industrial chemicals .Carcinogens that are causes of lung can- cer include aluminium; arsenic; asbestos 67 7.4.4 Interpretation of the evidence 7.4.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2,3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio sures of effect, to cancer of the lung include: Measur ement .Due to low sur vival rates, both incidence and mortality can be assessed. L ow sur vival times and rates decrease the reliability of case-control studies, which often rely on proxy reporting. Confounding .Smoking tobacco is the predominant cause of lung cancer, and smokers tend also to have less healthy diets,more sedentary ways of life, and to be leaner than non-smok- ers. Therefore a central task in assessing the results of dietary studies is to evaluate the degr ee to which observed associations in smok ers may be due to confounding/r esidual confounding by cigarette smoking; that is, not a direct result of the dietary exposure examined. A high proportion of the studies assessedbelow ar eappropriately adjusted for smoking. 261CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.4.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 561 publications were included in the SLR for lung cancer. Fuller summaries of the epidemiological, experi-mental, and mechanistic evidence are to be found in Chapters 4-6. Thefull SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.4.5.1 Non-starchy vegetables (Also see chapter 4.2.5.1.) Atotal of 17 cohort studies, 27 case-control studies, and 6 ecological studies investigated total vegetables. Other group- ings examined were non-starchy vegetables specifically (3cohort, 1 case-control); vegetables, non-starchy root veg-etables and tubers (2 cohort); and carrots (6 cohort, 21 case- control, 1 ecological). Most studies showed decreased risk with increased intake. Data are particularly consistent whenstratified for carr ots. A pooled analysis of 8 cohort studies (more than 430 000 participants, followed up for 6-16 years, with mor ethan 3200 lung cancer cases) showed a non-sig - nificant decreased risk for the groups that ate the most veg- etables. There was considerable heterogeneity, not allreadily explained. This is a wide and disparate category, and many different plant food constituents are represented that could contributeto a pr otective effect of are potentially antioxidants. Antioxidants trap free radicals and reactive oxygen molecules, protectingagainst o xidation damage. It is difficult to unravel the r ela- tive importance of each constituent and it is likely that any protective effect may result from a combination of influenceson several pathways involved in carcinogenesis. Asubstantial amount of evidence is available but some studies wer enot adjusted for smoking. A dose response is appar ent from both cohort and case- control studies. There is limited evidence suggesting that non-starchy vegetables protect against lungcancer . 7.4.5.2 Fr chapter 4.2.5.2.) Twenty-five cohort studies, 32 case-control studies, and 7 ecological studies investigated fruit consumption. Most ofthese showed decr eased risk with incr eased intak e. Meta- analysis of cohort data showed a 6 per cent decreased risk per 80 g serving/day; meta-analysis of case-control datashowed a 20 per cent decreased risk per serving/day (figure 4.2.25). A pooled analysis of 8 cohort studies (more than 430 000 participants, followed up for 6-16 years, with mor ethan 3200 lung cancer cases) showed a 23 per cent decr eased risk for the groups that ate the most fruit. There is considerable heterogeneity, perhaps explained by the broad and disparatenatur eof this categor y.Fruits are sources of vitamin C and other antioxidants, such as carotenoids, phenols, and flavonoids, as well as other potentially bioactive phytochemicals. Antioxidants trap free radicals and reactive oxygen molecules, protecting againstoxidation damage. In addition, flavonoids found in fruit directly inhibit the expression of a cytochrome P450 enzyme. This helps to metabolise toxins and has been asso- ciated with increased risk of lung cancer, primarily in smok- ers. 68It is difficult to unravel the relative importance of each constituent, and it is likely that any protective effect may result from a combination of influences on several pathways involved in carcinogenesis. The evidence is ample and consistent. A dose-response relationship is apparent from both cohort and case-control studies and there is evidence for plausiblemechanisms operating in humans. The evidence that fruits protect against lung cancer is convincing. The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR ,one case-control study69has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see bo x3.8. 7.4.5.3 Foods containing carotenoids (Also see chapter 4.2.5.3.) Atotal of 11 cohort studies, 16 case-control studies, and 1 ecological study investigated total dietary carotenoids; 4cohort studies and 5 case-contr ol studies investigated serum or plasma car otenoids. Other gr oupings examined were dietary beta-cryptoxanthin (7 cohort, 8 case-control, 1 eco- logical), and serum/plasma beta-cr yptoxanthin (6 cohort, 1 case-control). Nearly all cohort studies and most case-con- trol studies showed decreased risk with increased intake.Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 2 per cent decr eased risk per 1 mg dietary carotenoid intake per day, or per 10 \u00b5g beta-cryptoxanthin intake per day (figure 4.2.28). Apooled analysis of 7 cohort studies (almost 400 000 partic-ipants, followed up for 7-16 years, with more than 3100lung cancer cases) showed a 24 per cent decr eased risk for the gr oups that consumed the most beta-cr yptoxanthin. Several case-contr ol studies did not adjust for smoking. Data come predominantly from dietary sources, not supplements; therefore no effect can be attributed to carotenoids separatefrom foods. Carotenoids are antioxidants, which can prevent lipid oxi- dation and related oxidative stress. Some, such as beta- carotene, ar ealso pr o-vitamin A car otenoids. There is a substantial amount of evidence available from both cohort and case-contr ol studies. A clear dose-response relationship is apparent from cohort studies. Foods containing carotenoids probably protect against lung cancer. 7.4.5.4 Foods containing selenium (Also see chapter 4.2.5.8.) Two cohort studies, 2 case-control studies, and 2 ecological studies investigated dietary selenium; 10 cohort studies, 7case-contr ol studies, and 4 ecological studies investigated 262PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS plasma or serum selenium; and 3 cohort studies investigat- ed selenium levels in nails. Most studies showed decreased risk with increased intake. Meta-analysis of cohort data on plasma or serum selenium produced evidence of decreasedrisk with a clear dose-response relationship. Dietary selenium deficiency has been shown to cause a lack of selenoprotein expression. Twenty-five selenoproteins have been identified in animals and a number of these have important anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.Four are glutathione peroxidases, which biomolecules such lipids, lipopro- teins, and DNA. Three are thioredoxin reductases and, among other functions, these regenerate oxidised ascorbic acid to its active antioxidant form. The evidence available is sparse. There is limited evidence to suggest that foods containing selenium protect against lung cancer. 7.4.5.5 Foods containing quer cetin (Also see chapter 4.2.5.9.) Two cohort studies and thr ee case-contr ol studies investi - gated quercetin intake. Both cohort studies showed statisti- cally significant decreased risk for the highest intake groups.Data from case-control studies were more heterogeneous. Quercetin is a flavonoid which directly inhibits expression of a cytochrome P450 enzyme that helps to metabolise tox-ins, r esulting in decreased DNA damage in laboratory exper- iments. 70 The evidence available is sparse and inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that foodscontaining quercetin protect against lung cancer. 7.4.5.6 Red meat (Also see chapter 4.3.5.1.1.) One cohort study and nine case-control studies investigatedred meat. The single cohort study and most of the case-con-trol studies showed increased risk with increased intake. Red meat contains haem ir on (see box 4.3.3). Free iron can lead to the pr oduction of fr ee radicals. When cooked at high temperatures, red meat can also contain heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (see box 4.3.4). There is limited evidence, mostly from inconsistent case-contr ol studies, suggesting that r ed meat is a cause of lung cancer . 7.4.5.7 Processed meat (Also see chapter 4.3.5.1.2.) Four cohort studies and 10 case-control studies investigated processed meat, most of which showed increased risk withincreased intake. N-nitroso compounds are suspected mutagens and car- cinogens that ar efound in processed meats, and produced in the stomach fr om nitrates, including those used to pr e- serve meats.55Many processed meats also contain high lev- els of salt and nitrite (see box 4.3.2). When cooked at hightemperatur es, meats can also contain ocyclic aminesand polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (see box 4.3.4). Haem promotes the formation of N-nitroso compounds and also contains iron. Free iron can lead to production of free radi- cals (see box 4.3.3). There is limited, inconsistent evidence suggesting that processed meat is a cause of lung cancer. 7.4.5.8 Total fat (Also see chapter 4.5.5.1.) Nine cohort studies, 17 case-control studies, and 4 ecologi- cal studies investigated total fat intake. Most studies showed increased risk with increased intake, although cohort data were less suggestive of an effect, and few studies were sta-tistically significant. No evidence for plausible mechanismswas found. The mixed results from cohort studies contrast with the more consistent results from other studies. Overall,thereis limited evidence suggesting that consumption of total fat is a cause of lung cancer. The Panel emphasises that the principle cause of lung cancer is smoking tobacco. 7.4.5.9 Butter (Also see chapter 4.5.5.1.1.) Two cohort studies and eight case-control studies investi-gated butter consumption .Most studies showed increased risk with incr eased intak e, but cohort data were inconsistent. No evidence for plausible mechanisms was found. There is a limited amount of inconsistent evidence suggesting that consumption of butter is a cause oflung cancer . 7.4.5.10 Arsenic in drinking water (Also see chapter 4.7.5.1.1.) Two cohort studies, 2 case-control studies, and 12 ecologi-cal studies investigated arsenic in drinking water .All cohort and case-contr ol studies, and most ecological studies, showed a r elationship between incr eased levels of arsenic in drinking water and increased incidence. Meta-analysis was not possible, but effect estimates tended to be large (anincreased risk of over 300 per cent for the highest levels). Soluble arsenic in drinking water induces lung cancers in animal models. 71In humans, arsenic is a chr omosomal muta - gen (an agent that induces mutations involving mor ethan one gene, typically large deletions or rearrangements). It can also act as a synergistic co-mutagen. Arsenic alsocauses chr onic lung disease. 71The Joint F AO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has set a provisional tolerable weekly intake of 0.015 mg/kg of body weight.72 The evidence is ample and consistent, from cohort and case-contr ol as well as ecological studies. There is a dose-r esponse r elationship, and the effect size is relatively large. There is robust evidence for mechanisms. The evidence that arsenic in drinkingwater is a cause of lung cancer is convincing. 263CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.4.5.11 Retinol supplements (in smokers) (Also see chapter 4.10.6.4.1.) Two trials (one randomised controlled, one non-randomised), two cohort studies, and two case-control studies investigat-ed retinol or retinol supplements. The single randomised con- trolled trial, performed in current and former smokers only, showed a statistically significant increased risk with a high- dose supplement. There was a suggestion of further elevat- ed incidence in heavy smokers and asbestos workers. Thenon-randomised trial was inconclusive. One cohort, also strat- ified by smoking status, showed a relationship with increased incidence only in current smokers. All other studies failed to stratify by smoking status and were inconclusive. It is possible that some protective effect present at dietary intake amounts of vitamins is lost or reversed by the higherlevels supplied by pharmacologic supplementation. The evidence is sparse and inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that high-dose vitamin Asupplements ar eacause of lung cancer in curr ent smokers. 7.4.5.12 Beta-carotene supplements (in smokers) (Also see chapter 4.10.6.4.2.) Four randomised controlled trials and two cohort studiesinvestigated beta-carotene supplements. Of these, one ran-domised controlled trial was performed in smokers. Thisstudy showed a statistically significant incr eased risk of 17 per cent with a daily 20 mg beta-car otene supplement. It also suggested that heavy smoking elevated the risk further. Other trials and studies, either in non-smok ers or not strat - ified according to smoking status, were inconclusive. There is a marked interaction between beta-carotene, heavy smoking, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) geno - type. GST is a carcinogen-detoxifying enzyme (see chapter 2.5). Beta-carotene supplementation among people withoutGSTM1 (one of the variants of the GST gene) who smokedmore than 42 cigarettes per day was compared to beta-carotene supplementation among those without GSTM1 who smok ed less than 37 cigar ettes per day. A relative risk of 6.01 (95% confidence inter val 1.90-19.08) was obser ved. It is possible that a protective association present at dietary intake amounts of carotenoids is lost or reversed by the high-er levels that pharmacological supplementation may supply . In one animal study, low-dose beta-carotene was protective against smoking-induced changes in the tumour -suppr essor p53 gene (see bo x2.2), while high doses pr omoted these changes. 73Asecond explanation could relate to disturbance of the complex nature of naturally occurring carotenoids. Itis possible that the pr otective associations ar enot due to the specific agent used in supplement studies, but rather to other carotenoids present in dietary exposure, 74or other associat- ed dietary or health-related behaviour. Thereis strong evidence from good-quality trials, consistent with cohort studies. An interaction betweensmoking, genotype, and beta-carotene is apparent. Theevidence that beta-carotene in curr ent smok ers is convincing.7.4.5.13 Selenium supplements (Also see 4.10.6.4.5.) One randomised controlled trial investigated selenium sup- plements and lung cancer. The single trial of more than 1300 participants given 200 \u00b5g/day of selenium for 13 years showed a non-signifi- cant decreased risk with supplementation, adjusted for age and smoking. Subgroup analysis indicated that this risk dif- fered according to baseline plasma selenium level, with a sta-tistically significant decreased risk for those with the lowest initial plasma selenium. This is suggestive that selenium sup- plementation may decrease cancer risk in those who have poor selenium status, but that this effect may not extend to those who do not. Dietary selenium deficiency has been shown to cause a lack of selenoprotein expression. Twenty-five selenoproteinshave been identified in animals and a number of these have important anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Four are glutathione peroxidases, which protect damage to biomolecules such as lipopr o- teins, and DNA. Three are thioredoxin reductases and, among other functions, these r egenerate o xidised ascorbic acid to its active antioxidant form. The evidence is sparse. There is limited evidence suggesting that selenium protects against lung cancer. 7.4.5.14 Physical activity (Also see chapter 5.4.4.) In total, 5 cohort studies investigated total physical activi-ty;2cohort studies investigated non-r ecreational activity ;4 cohort studies and 2 case-control studies investigated occu- pational activity; and 11 cohort studies and 4 case-controlstudies investigated r ecreational activity .Overall, most studies showed decreased risk with increased physical activ- ity. No studies showed a statistically significant increasedrisk. Of the categories analysed, consistent protective rela-tionships were reported for total physical activity, non-recre-ational activity ,and recreational activity. Increased heter ogeneity in occupational physical activity may be due to either the extr eme variation in exposur edefinition, or the generally lower levels of occupational activity, meaning that, as a percentage of daily activity, occupational activity is ofreduced importance in many high-income countries (where these studies were generally performed). Sustained, moderate physical activity raises metabolic rate and incr eases maximal o xygen uptak e. In the long term, regular periods of such activity increase the body's metabolic efficiency and capacity (the amount of work that it canperform), as well as r educing blood pr essur eand insulin resistance. There is evidence from prospective and case-control studies showing lower risk of lung cancer with higherlevels of physical activity ,but there is no evidence of plausible mechanisms. The r elationship between activity , BMI, and lung cancer makes the evidence difficult to interpret. There is limited evidence suggesting thatphysical activity pr otects against lung cancer . 264PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study75has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.4.5.15 Body fatness (Also see chapter 6.1.3.1.) Twenty-one cohort studies, 24 case-control studies, and 1 ecological study investigated body fatness, as measured by BMI. Nearly all of the cohort and case-control studies showeddecreased risk with increased BMI. Meta-analysis of cohort and case-control data provided evidence of a statistically sig- nificant reduced risk, with no heterogeneity in cohort data. Smoking is the principal cause of lung cancer and may also be associated with lower BMI. There is a high potential forconfounding due to tobacco smoking, and residual con-founding is therefore possible. In addition, it is possible thatpeople with undiagnosed lung cancer may lose weight, so giving a spurious association (reverse causation). There is no known mechanism through which greater body fatness could plausibly pr otect against lung cancer ,or through which low body fatness could increase risk. Although the epidemiological evidence suggests an inverse relationship, this could be caused byconfounding by cigarette smoking or reverse causationdue to weight loss from undiagnosed cancer. There islimited evidence suggesting that low body fatness is acause of lung cancer . 7.4.5.16 Other exposures Other exposur es wer eevaluated. However ,the data wer e either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number of studies too few to allow conclusions to be reached. Thesewereas follows: cer eals (grains) or size, shape, and composition (except low body fatness); and culturally defined diets. 7.4.6 Comparison with pr evious r eport 7.4.6.1 General See section 7.1.6.1 of this chapter, and box 3.8 in chapter 3. 7.4.6.2 Specific The previous report judged the evidence that vegetables and fruits protect against lung cancer to be convincing. Evidence, particularly from cohort studies published since the mid- 1990s, is mor econsistent for fruits than for vegetables. The findings of the pr evious r eport for car otenoids, and for pharmaceutical doses of beta-carotene given to smokers, were identical to the current findings (for foods containingcarotenoids), although the pr evious r eport did not include amatrix entry for beta-carotene supplements. The previous report did not review arsenic. 7.4.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The evidence that arsenic in drinking water and (in smok- ers only) pharmacological doses of beta-carotene are caus-es of lung cancer is convincing. Fruits, and also foods containing carotenoids, probably protect against lung cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that non-starchy veg- etables, selenium and foods containing it, foods containingquercetin, and physical activity protect against lung cancer. There is also limited evidence suggesting that red meat, processed meat, total fat, butter, pharmacological doses of retinol (in smokers only), and low body fatness are causes of lung cancer. Smoking tobacco is the main cause of lung cancer . 265CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.5 Stomach Cancer of the stomach is the fourth most common type of cancer worldwide. Almost one million cases were recordedin2002. Two out of three cases occur in men. Overall, it is decreasing rapidly in high-income countries, but remainsvery common elsewhere in the world. It is usually fataland is the second most common cause of death fromcancer. Overall, the Panel judges that food and nutrition play an important role in the prevention and causation of stomachcancer. The Panel judges as follows: Non-starchy vegetables, including specifically allium vegetables, as well as fruits probably protect against stomach cancer. Salt, and also salt-pr eserved foods, ar eprobably causes of this cancer. Thereis limited evidence suggesting that pulses (legumes), including soya and soya products, and alsofoods containing selenium protect against stomach cancer. There is also limited evidence suggesting that chilli, processed meat, smoked foods, and grilled (broiled) andbarbecued (charbroiled) animal foods are causes ofstomach cancer . Infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is established as a necessary cause of almost all cases ofstomach cancer .It has been estimated that most cases ofthis cancer are preventable by appropriate diets and associated factors. In final summary ,the str ongest evidence, corr esponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\",shows that non-starchy vegetables, allium vegetables, and fruitsprotect against stomach cancer; and that salt and alsosalt-preserved foods are causes of this cancer . The stomach is the sac-like part of the digestive system between the oesophagus and the small intestine. The bodyof the stomach is lined by a mucous membrane consisting of columnar epithelial cells and glands, surrounded by muscle. Therearetwo main types of stomach cancer .Distal gastric cancers (those of the lower portion of the stomach) are the predominant type. The other type is cancer of the gastriccardia or of the gastr o-oesophageal junction . 4The latter ar e sometimes grouped with oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Distal gastric cancers may be classified depending on their appearance under the microscope as intestinal or diffuse (from mucus-producing cells). The former is more common and pr edominates in areas of high incidence; the latter has apoorer prognosis, tends to occur at a younger age, and may also occur in the cardia.76More than 95 per cent of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas.777.5.1 Trends, incidence, and survival Age-adjusted rates of stomach cancer ar edecreasing, and in 2002 (in many countries) wer ehalf what they wer e30 years earlier. However, during the same period, two types of can- cer affecting the upper (proximal) section of the stomach \u2014those of the gastr o-oesophageal junction and gastric car dia FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, ANDCANCER OF THE STOMACH Inthe judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the stomach. Judgements are graded according to the strength ofthe evidence. DECREASES RISK INCREASES RISK Convincing Probable Non-starchy Salt2 orbarbecued (charbroiled) animal foods6 Limited \u2014 Cereals (grains) and their products; dietary fibre; no conclusion potatoes; starchy roots, tubers, and plantains; nuts fatness; ener gy intake Substantial effect on risk None identified unlikely 1 Judgements on vegetables and fruits do not include those preserved by salting and/or pickling. 2 'Salt' here means total salt consumption, from processed foods, including salty and salted foods, and also salt added in cooking and at the table. 3 Including soya and soya products.4Includes both foods naturally containing the constituent and foods which have the constituent added (see chapter 3.5.3). 5 The term 'processed meat' refers to meats preserved by smoking, curing, or salting, or addition of chemical preservatives. 6 The evidence is mostly from meats preserved or cooked in these ways.

This has had the effect of increasing availabilityand consumption of fresh foods such as vegetables and fruits, and decreasing consumption of foods preserved by salt and other relevant methods. 7980 Age-adjusted incidence rates range from more than 60 per 100 000 people in Japan and other countries in eastern Asia,to less than 10 per 100 000 in much of Africa and North America. Chile and other Latin American countries, as well as Portugal and eastern Europe, have moderately high rates of 30 per 100 000. Rates are also higher in some ethnic groups, for instance, Asian and Pacific Islanders living in theUSA, and African-American, and Hispanic-American people;rates are also twice as high in men as women. Rates of dif-ferent types of stomach cancer also vary, both geographically and between ethnic groups. Cancers affecting the lower (dis- tal) section of the stomach are most common in low- to mid-dle-income countries and in people of African origin; proximal tumours are predominant in high-income countriesand in white people. 78Risk incr eases with age; stomach can - cer is rarely diagnosed in people under 50. The 5-year survival rate for stomach cancer is approxi- mately 20 per cent.36Survival rates are higher in countries which have screening programmes that lead to early detec-tion, and where distal cancer (which has a better prognosis)predominates. 81Stomach cancer accounts for nearly 9 per cent of all cancer incidence, but somewhat over 10 per centof all cancer deaths worldwide. Also see box 7.1.1. 7.5.2 Pathogenesis Changes in the stomach mucosa, brought about by a variety of environmental factors and ageing, can eventually lead toatrophic gastritis. The chronic form of this condition, and theresulting changes in the characteristics of the stomach cells,appear to be pr ecursor conditions to the development of dis- tal stomach cancer . 4Food car cinogens can also potentially interact dir ectly with the epithelial cells that line the stom - ach. However, cancer can also develop without these pre- cursors, particularly when the bacterium Hpylori is present in the stomach (see bo x7.5.1).81 Three independent cohort studies have shown the pro- gression of gastritis fr om the non-atrophic Epidemiological studies of atr ophic gastritis have also shown an association with dietary factors, especially a high intake of salt (mostly in the form of salty and salted foods).90 N-nitrosamines ar eknown car cinogens pr oduced in the stomach from nitrate in foods, and via nitrite from endoge- nous nitric oxide production in chronic inflammation (seebox 4.3.2). They may be potential causes of stomach can- cer 92(see chapter 2.4.2.6). Cancers of the gastric car dia show many similarities to oesophageal cancer (see 7.3.1). Ther eis a clear association oesophagus and adenocarcinoma of the lower gastric causedby chr onic acid damage.The diffuse type of distal stomach cancers (those that develop from mucus-producing cells) show some genetic pre-disposition, with an increased risk for people with bloodgroup A. Genetic predisposition is thought to be a factor in5-10 per cent of diffuse cancers. 93Stomach cancer is part of the spectrum of cancers associated with the germ line mis - match r epair (MMR) gene alterations that give rise to her ed- itary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).77Also see chapter 7.9.2. 7.5.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) Infection and infestation .The bacterium Hpylori is an important cause of distal stomach cancers (see box 7.5.1). Also, Epstein-Barr virus is carcinogenic to humans and hasbeen linked to stomach cancers (particularly gastric lym- phoepithelial carcinomas and a smaller proportion of gastric adenocar cinomas) in some studies. 30 Industrial chemicals .Industrial exposure to ethylene oxide is carcinogenic to humans and has led to increased risk ofstomach cancer in some studies. 94 Hpylori is a bacterium that lives in the human stomach. Infection does not usually produce symptoms, and spreads through salivaand faecal material. Prevalence increases with age, but differs dramatically among populations. 82In the USA, prevalence is less than 20 per cent at 20 years old and about 50 per cent at 50 years, which may be typical of high-income countries,83while in Korea, it is 50 per cent at 5 years and 90 per cent at 20 years,and in Japan it reaches 85 per cent by middle age. 84 Hpylori colonises the gastric mucosa and elicits both inflam- matory and immune lifelong responses, including the release ofvarious bacterial and host-dependent cytotoxic substances. 85 Hpylori infection greatly reduces the bioavailability of vitamin C. This may play a role in the development of stomach cancer inthe presence of dietary and other factors that are a cause of this cancer. In studies of precancerous lesions or gastric atrophy, erad- ication of Hpylori promoted regression of these cancer precur- sors.86-88 Some people develop stomach cancer without apparent infec- tion with Hpylori. Reported percentages of non-cardia cancers that test positive for Hpylori range from approximately 60 to 95 per cent, averaging ar ound 86 per cent,89but those with distal stomach cancer who test negative for Hpylori may have under- gone a loss of infection associated with the atr ophic gastritis, and consequently a decline in antibody titre. It can be regarded as anecessary cause for those stomach cancers arising in the distal region of the stomach. 90 The longer the time of infection, and the gr eater the impact on the gastric mucosa, the more likely it is that stomach cancer will develop and take a severe form. The exact site of the can-cer is most likely to be where the mucosa is most affected. 91 Those who develop extensive gastritis and gastric atr ophy ar eat increased risk cancer.81Box 7.5.1 Helicobacter pylori 267CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.5.4 Interpretation of the evidence 7.5.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio of Considerations specific to cancer of the stomach include the following. Classification .Most evidence relates to distal stomach can- cers, although cancers of the gastric cardia and gastro-oesophageal junction might be included in an outcome of 'stomach cancer'. It is now well recognised that proximal and distal stomach cancers are quite different, but relatively fewstudies stratified r esults on the basis of subsite. F or many early studies, most stomach cancer was probably distal in ori- gin,so the lack of stratification was less important. As the incidence and overall proportion of proximal cancer have increased in recent years in high-income countries, there isagreater likelihood that the general term 'stomach cancer' will represent a combination of the two subsites and there-fore results will be less informative. Measur ement .Owing to low sur vival rates, both incidence and mortality can be assessed. Low survival times and rates decrease the r eliability of case-contr ol studies, which often rely on proxy reporting. Confounding .Hpylori infection is a necessar ycause of dis - tal stomach cancer. This has only been established relative- ly recently. Only recent studies have incorporated Hpylori status into their design and have adjusted or stratified for infection. 7.5.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 722 publications were included in the SLR for stom- ach cancer .Fuller summaries of the epidemiological, exper- imental, and mechanistic evidence are to be found in Chapters 4-6. Thefull SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.5.5.1 Non-star chy vegetables (Also see chapter 4.2.5.1.) Atotal of 10 cohort studies, 45 case-control studies, and 19 ecological studies investigated total vegetables. Other group- ings examined were green-yellow vegetables (11 cohort, 21 case-contr ol, 8 ecological); green, leafy vegetables (6 cohort, 13 case-contr ol, 2 ecological); tomatoes (3 cohort, 19 case- control); white or pale vegetables (2 cohort, 6 case-control); raw vegetables (6 cohort, 25 case-control, 3 ecological); ornon-star chy vegetables and fruits (5 cohort, 6 case-contr ol).Most studies showed decreased risk with increased intake. However, cohort data were less consistent than case-control data. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 19 per cent decreased risk per 50 g green-yellow vegetables/day; no othersubcategory analyses were statistically significant. Case-con- trol data showed a 15 per cent decreased risk per 50 g veg- etables/day (figures 4.2.8. and 4.2.9); a 21 per cent decreased risk per 50 g green-yellow vegetables/day; a 57 per cent decreased risk per 50 g green, leafy vegetables/day; a30 per cent decreased risk per 50 g tomatoes/day; and a 25 percent decreased risk per 50 g raw vegetables/day (figure 4.2.12). There was unexplained heterogeneity. This is a wide and disparate category, and many different plant food constituents are represented that could contributeto a protective effect of Antioxidants trapfree radicals and r eactive o xygen molecules, pr otecting against oxidation damage. It is difficult to unravel the rela- tive importance of each constituent and it is lik ely that any protective effect may result from a combination of influences on several pathways involved in carcinogenesis. Asubstantial amount of evidence is available, including on specific subtypes, particularly green-yellow vegetables, with a dose-r esponse relationship in case-contr ol, but not cohort, data. Ther eis evidence for plausible mechanisms. Non-starchy vegetables probably pr otect against stomach cancer . The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-contr ol study95has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.5.5.2 Allium vegetables (Also see chapter 4.2.5.1.1.) Atotal of 2 cohort studies, 27 case-contr ol studies, and 2 ecological studies investigated allium vegetables; and 1cohort study ,16 case-contr ol studies, and 2 ecological stud- ies investigated garlic. There was also one relevant inter- vention study that combined allitridium (a garlic extractcontaining triallylsulphides) and selenium supplements. Most of the studies showed decreased risk with increased intak e. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 23 per cent decreased risk per 50 g allium vegetables/day .Meta-analy - sis of case-control data showed a 20 per cent decreased risk per 50 g allium vegetables/day (figure 4.2.14), and a 59 percent decr eased risk per ser ving of garlic/day .The single trial of combined selenium and allitridium supplements showed astatistically significant decreased risk in men but not women, after 5 years of follow-up. Allium vegetables, particularly garlic, have antibiotic prop- erties. Although this may act dir ectly against Hpylori, stud- ies in humans have not shown this effect. It is also possiblethat antibacterial effects of garlic might inhibit the secondary colonisation the stomach after Hpylori -induced atrophy. Atpresent, ther eis no evidence to support or refute this idea. 268PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS The evidence, though not copious and mostly from case-control studies, is consistent, with a dose-response relationship. There is evidence for plausiblemechanisms. Allium vegetables probably protectagainst stomach cancer. 7.5.5.3 Fruits (Also see chapter 4.2.5.2.) Sixteen cohort studies, 51 case-control studies, and 23 eco-logical studies investigated fruits. Most studies showed decreased risk with increased intake, but there was unex- plained heterogeneity. Cohort studies suggested a non-sig- nificant relationship with decreased risk. Meta-analysis of case-control data showed a 17 per cent decreased risk per50 g fruits per day (figure 4.2.27). Fruits are sources of vitamin C and other antioxidants, such as carotenoids, phenols, and flavonoids, as well as other potentially bioactive phytochemicals. Antioxidants trap free radicals and reactive oxygen molecules, protecting againstoxidation damage. In addition ,flavonoids found in fruits directly inhibit the expression of a cytochrome P450 enzyme, which helps to metabolise to xins and has been associated with increased risk of lung cancer, primarily in smokers. 68It is difficult to unravel the relative importance of each con-stituent and it is likely that a protective effect may result fromacombination of influences on several pathways involved in carcinogenesis. The evidence is ample and mor econsistent, with a dose-response relationship, for case-control studiesthan for cohorts. Ther eis evidence for plausible mechanisms. Fruits probably protect against stomachcancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, three case-control studies95-97have been published. This new infor- mation does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.5.5.4 Pulses (legumes) including soya and soya products (Also see chapter 4.2.5.10.) Atotal of 3 cohort studies, 22 case-control studies, and 16 ecological studies investigated pulses (legumes) andstomach cancer ;and 2 cohort studies, 9 case-control stud- ies, and 2 ecological studies investigated soya and soya prod- ucts. All of the cohort studies and most of the case-contr ol studies showed decr eased risk with incr eased intak e. Ecological studies showed decreased risk for soya and soya products, but were inconsistent for pulses (legumes). Meta-analysis of cohort studies showed a non-significant relationship with decreased risk. Meta-analysis of case-con- trol studies produced evidence for a relationship withdecreased risk. Pulses (legumes), particularly soya, contain high levels of isoflavones that shown anti-cancer pr operties in labo- rator Saponins and other bioactive con - stituents of soya (and to a lesser extent, other pulses) may also have anti-cancer properties, although these are less welldemonstrated.The evidence, mostly from case-control studies, is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting thatpulses (legumes), including soya and soya products,protect against stomach cancer. Foods containing selenium (Also see chapter 4.2.5.8.) One case-control study and 5 ecological studies investigated dietary selenium; 3 cohort studies, 9 case-control studies and3ecological studies investigated blood selenium; and 1 cohort study and 1 case-control study investigated selenium in toe- nails or hair. All of the studies for blood, nail, or hair seleni- um levels showed decreased risk with increased selenium intake. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a non-significantdecreased risk, and meta-analysis of case-control data pro-duced statistically significant evidence of decreased risk. Dietary selenium deficiency has been shown to cause a lack of selenoprotein expression. Twenty-five selenoproteins have been identified in animals these haveimportant damage to biomolecules such as lipids, lipopr o- teins, and DNA. Three are thioredoxin reductases, which, among other functions, regenerate oxidised ascorbic acid toits active antioxidant form. Selenoproteins with powerfulantioxidant activity may provide protection against theinflammatory effect of Hpylori that can lead to gastric can- cer in infected individuals. Asubstantial amount of evidence was available on selenium, fr om dietary questionnair es as well as blood, nails, and hair, mostly from case-control studies. There is limited evidence suggesting that foods containingselenium pr otect against stomach cancer . 7.5.5.6 Chilli (Also see chapter 4.2.5.12.1.) Fourteen case-control studies investigated chilli use. Most ofthese r eported increased risk with increased use, although results wer eheterogeneous and data were not suitable for meta-analysis. Anecdotally, chilli may be used to disguise 'off' flavours in foods, so these data may be confounded by socioeconomicstatus, the availability of r efrigeration, and Hpylori infection . Some constituents of chilli are irritants, which could there- foreplausibly incr ease inflammation in the stomach (also see chapter 2.4.1.3). The evidence, from case-control studies only, is inconsistent. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting that chilli is associated with an increased risk of stomach cancer. 7.5.5.7 Processed meat (Also see chapter 4.3.5.1.2.) Eight cohort studies, 21 case-contr ol studies, 1 cr oss-sec - tional study, and 1 ecological study investigated processed meat. Most of these showed increased risk with higherintak e. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a non- signifi - 269CHAPTER 7 CANCERS cant relationship with increased risk. Meta-analysis of case- control data produced evidence of a statistically significant dose-response relationship. Heterogeneity is likely to be caused by the diverse nature of definitions for processedmeat in different studies. Nitrates are produced endogenously in gastric acid, and are added as preservatives to processed meats. They may con- tribute to N-nitroso compound production and exposure. N- nitroso compounds are suspected mutagens and carcinogens(see box 4.3.2). 55Many processed meats also contain high levels of salt and nitrite. Meats cooked at high temperatures can contain heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (see box 4.3.4). Haem promotes the formation of N-nitroso compounds and also contains iron. Free iron can lead to the production of free radicals (see box 4.3.3). The evidence is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that processed meat is a cause of stomach cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort98and two case-contr ol studies9599have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.5.5.8 Smoked foods (Also see chapter 4.3.5.7.) Seventeen case-contr ol studies and two ecological studies investigated smok ed foods. Most of these showed incr eased risk with increased intake, with none reporting statistically significant r educed risk. Definitions of smoked foods varied between studies, although most included smoked meats and/or fish. Smokedfoods ar eoften salted. High rates of mortality fr om stomach cancer are found in countries such as Iceland, Hungary, and Latvia, where diets include a regular intake of meat and/orfish preserved by smoking. Smoked foods, particularly meats, may contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, depending on the fuel burned to pro- duce the smok e. 100(Also see bo x4.3.4.) Smok ed meats are also often salted or cur ed, meaning that they ar elikely to raise endogenous production of N-nitroso compounds in the stomach (see box 4.3.2). These are suspected causes of stom-ach cancer . Thereis limited evidence fr om case-control and ecological studies, some of which wer eof poor quality , that smoked foods are causes of stomach cancer. The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR ,three case-control studies95 96 99have been published. This new infor- mation does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.5.5.9 Grilled (broiled) or barbecued (charbr oiled) animal foods (Also see chapter 4.3.5.8.) Three cohort studies and 12 case-control studies investigat- ed grilled (broiled) or barbecued (charbroiled) foods (thesewerepredominantly meats or fish, although not all studiesspecified the foods studied). Most studies showed increased risk with increased intake. Cooking methods involving grilling above a heat source and barbecuing can produce marked differences in levels ofcarcinogens in foods cooked in these ways (see chapter 4.9.4). For example, fat dripping on hot surfaces can form polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines (see box 4.3.4), while oven grilling prevents this from hap- pening, resulting in much lower levels of these compoundsin the cooked foods. There is limited, inconsistent evidence, mostly from case-control studies, that grilled (broiled) orbarbecued (charbroiled) animal foods are causes ofstomach cancer. 7.5.5.10 Salt (Also see chapter 4.6.5.2.) Three cohort studies, 21 case-control studies, and 12 eco-logical studies investigated total salt use. Other gr oupings examined were salt added at the table (2 cohort, 13 case-con- trol) and sodium intak e(1 cohort, 8 case-contr ol). Most stud - ies showed increased risk with increased intake, but there is some unexplained heterogeneity. Meta-analysis of case-con-trol data showed an 18 per cent increased risk per gram ofsodium per day; the meta-analyses for total salt indicatedincreased risk but were not statistically significant (figure4.6.1). Assessment of salt intak eis complicated as the small pr o- portion added during preparation or at the table is very vari- able and difficult to quantify .Higher -quality studies, which are better adjusted, tend to report a greater or more signif- icant effect. However, residual confounding is possible: saltintak emay be inversely r elated to the availability of r efrig- eration in a population, and so to socioeconomic status, which is itself related to stomach cancer risk. Salt has been shown to directly damage the stomach lin- ing in animal trials. It has also been shown to increaseendogenous N-nitroso compound formation (see box 4.3.2). Salt may enhance the action of car cinogens in the stomach. In addition ,salt intak emay facilitate Hpylori infection .101 There is a substantial amount of evidence from studies on total salt use, salt added at the table, and sodiumintake. For total salt use, a dose-response relationshipwas appar ent fr om cohort but not case-control studies. For sodium intak e, a dose r esponse was also appar ent from case-control studies. The mechanistic evidence is strong. Salt is a probable cause of stomach cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort102and two case-control studies95 99have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.5.5.11 Salted and salty foods (Also see chapter 4.6.5.2.1.) Four cohort studies, 17 case-control studies, and 1 ecologi-cal study investigated salty or salted foods. Nearly all of the 270PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS studies showed increased risk with increased intake. Meta- analysis of cohort data showed a non-significant increased risk; meta-analysis of case-control data showed a 5.2-fold increased risk per serving per day (figure 4.6.2).Heterogeneity may be partly explained by variation between studies in the precise foods being assessed. Asstated above, assessment of salt intake is complicated. Again, higher-quality studies report a greater or more sig- nificant effect. Again, salt has been shown to directly damage the stom- ach lining in animal trials. It has also been shown to increase endogenous N-nitroso compound formation (see box 4.3.2). The evidence, both from case-control and cohort studies, is consistent. A dose-response relationship isapparent from case-control but not cohort studies.There is robust evidence for mechanisms operating in humans. Salted and salty foods are probable causes of stomach cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two case-contr ol studies9599have been published. This new infor - mation does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.5.5.12 Other exposures Other exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number ofstudies too few to allow conclusions to be r eached. These wereasfollows: cer eals (grains) and their products; starchy roots, potatoes, and other tubers; plantains; nuts and seeds; herbs, spices, and condiments; eating speed. 7.5.6 Comparison with previous report 7.5.6.1 General See 7.1.6.1, and box 3.8. 7.5.6.2 Specific The previous report judged the evidence that vegetables and fruits protect against stomach cancer to be convincing. Sincethen,the evidence fr om cohort studies has been rather equiv - ocal, whereas evidence from case-control studies remains strong and consistent. Previously, the compounds found inallium vegetables were judged possibly to protect against stomach cancer; more recent evidence for allium vegetables is stronger. Theprevious r eport found the evidence that r efrigeration protects against stomach cancer to be convincing. Also see box 4.6.4. Befor ethe mid-1990s ther ewerenopublished trials ofselenium supplements. Two trials are now available, as well as increased numbers of cohort and case-control studies, but the evidence is still limited and only suggestive of a protec- tive effect. 7.5.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : Non-starchy vegetables, and specifically allium vegetables, aswell as fruits probably protect against stomach cancer. Salt and salt-preserved foods are probably causes of this cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that pulses (legumes) including soya and soya products and foods containing sele-nium protect against stomach cancer. There is also limited evidence suggesting that chilli, processed meat, smoked foods, and grilled (broiled) and bar- becued (charbroiled) animal foods are causes of stomachcancer . Infection with the bacterium Hpylori is a necessary but not sufficient cause of stomach cancer . 271CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.6 Pancreas Cancer of the pancreas is the thirteenth most common type of cancer worldwide. About 230 000 cases wererecorded in 2002, accounting for around 2 per cent of cancers overall. The incidence is somewhat morecommon in men than in women. It is generallyincreasing, particularly in high-income countries, where it is most frequent. It is rare in Africa and Asia. This cancer is almost always fatal and is the ninth most common cause of cancer death. Overall, the Panel is impressed by the strength of the evidence that body fatness, abdominal fatness, and thefactors that lead to greater adult attained height, or itsconsequences, are causes of cancer of the pancreas. The Panel judges as follows: The evidence that body fatness is a cause of cancer of the pancreas is convincing; abdominal fatness is probablyacause of this cancer . Foods containing folate probably protect against this cancer. The factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences, are probably a cause of pancreaticcancer. It is unlik ely that coffee has any substantial effect on the risk of this cancer . There is limited evidence suggesting that fruits and physical activity pr otect against this cancer ,and that r ed meat is a cause of this cancer. See chapter 8 for evidence and judgements on factors that modify the risk of body fatness and abdominalfatness, including physical activity and sedentary ways of life, the energy density of foods and drinks, andbreastfeeding. Tobacco smoking is an established cause of this cancer . In final summary ,the str ongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\", shows that body fatness and (probably) abdominal fatness are both causes of cancer of thepancr eas, and that the factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences, are probably also a cause of this cancer .Foods containing folate are probably protective. It is unlik ely that coffee has any substantial effect on the risk of this cancer. The pancreas is an elongated gland located behind the stomach. It contains two types of tissue, exocrine and endocrine. The exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes that are secreted into the small intestine. Cells in the endocrine pancr eas produce hormones including insulin and glucagon ,which influence glucose metabolism. Over 95 per cent of pancreatic cancers are adenocarci- nomas of the exocrine pancreas, the type included in thisReport.7.6.1 Trends, incidence, and survival Age-adjusted rates of pancr eatic cancer have been general - ly stable since the 1970s, following an approximate three- fold rise over the preceding 50 years in the countries forwhich data are available. 103 104 This is mainly a disease of high-income countries, where overall rates ar enearly three times higher than in middle- and low-income countries. Ar ound the world, age-adjusted incidence rates range from 10-15 per 100 000 people in parts of northern, central, and eastern Europe to less than1per 10 0000 in ar eas of Africa and Asia, although rates are FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE PANCREAS Inthe judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the pancreas. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence.

It is a marker for genetic, envir onmental, hormonal, and also nutritional factors affecting growth during the period from preconception to completion oflinear growth (see chapter 6.2.1.3). 3 Judgements on vegetables and fruits do not include those preserved by salting and/or pickling. 4 Physical activity of all types: occupational, household, transport, and recreational. 5The ter m'red meat' refers to beef, pork, lamb, and goat from domesticated animals. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossar y. 272PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS relatively high in some countries in these areas, for exam- ple, Japan and Korea. In the USA, rates are higher among African-American people than in white people.3The risk of pancreatic cancer increases with age, with most diagnosesmade in people between the ages of 60 and 80. The early stages of this cancer do not usually produce symptoms, so the disease is generally advanced when it is diagnosed. Survival rates are therefore low \u2014 around 4 per cent at 5 years. This cancer accounts for around 2 per centof all cancer incidence, but somewhat over 3 per cent of all cancer deaths. 4Also see box 7.1.1. 7.6.2 Pathogenesis The ductal cells in the head of the pancreas are exposed to pancreatic secretions, as well as bile, and environmental car- cinogens can reach these cells through those fluids or in the blood (see 7.7). The pancr eas is r elatively inaccessible to r outine medical examination, so the progression of this cancer through pre- cursor lesions is not well understood. However ,inflamma - tion is implicated in this process through chronic pancreatitis, which is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. The role of infec-tion with Hpylori (see box 7.5.1) is the subject of ongoing research.105Conditions that lead to high insulin levels in pan- creatic secretions, such as insulin resistance and type 2 dia-betes, may incr ease the risk of this cancer. 106 Morethan 90 per cent of pancr eatic cancer cases are spo- radic (due to spontaneous rather than inherited mutations), although a family histor yincreases risk, particularly wher e more than one family member is involved.105Around 75-90 per cent of pancreatic cancer cases involve a point mutationin the K -ras oncogene 107(see bo x2.2 in chapter 2). 7.6.3 Other established causes (Also see chapters 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) Tobacco use .Appr oximately 25 per cent of cases of pancre- atic cancer are attributable to tobacco smoking. 7.6.4 Interpretation of the evidence 7.6.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2,3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio sures of to cancer of the pancr eas include: Measurement .Owing to very low survival rates, both inci- dence and mortality can be assessed. L ow sur vival times andrates decrease the reliability of case-control studies, which often rely on proxy reporting. Confounding .High-quality studies adjust for smoking. 7.6.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 318 publications were included in the SLR for this cancer. Fuller summaries of the epidemiological, experi- mental, and mechanistic evidence are in Chapters 4-6. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.6.5.1 Fruits (Also see chapter 4.2.5.2.) Six cohort studies, 16 case-control studies, and 8 ecological studies investigated fruits. All cohort studies and most other studies showed decreased risk with increased intake. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a non-significant decr eased risk. Meta-analysis of case-control data showed a statistically significant decr eased risk. Fruits are sources of vitamin C and other antioxidants, such as carotenoids, phenols, and freeradicals reactive oxygen againstoxidation damage. In addition, flavonoids found in fruitdirectly inhibit the expression of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, which helps to metabolise to xins and has been asso - ciated with increased risk of lung cancer, primarily in smok- ers. 68It is difficult to unravel the r elative importance of each constituent and is likely that a protective effect may result from a combination of influences on several pathwaysinvolved in car cinogenesis. The evidence is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that fruits protect against pancreatic cancer. The P anel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study108has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see bo x3.8. 7.6.5.2 Foods containing folate (Also see chapter 4.2.5.4.) Three cohort studies, two case-control studies, and one eco- logical study investigated folate fr om foods and/or folic acid from supplements. Meta-analysis of all thr ee cohort studies showed a non-significant decreased risk, with high hetero- geneity. When stratified according to the source, both dietarystudies showed a non-significant decr eased risk, and thr ee studies of supplements showed a non-significant increased risk. One cohort study also analysed serum folate levels,showing a significant decreased risk of 55 per cent for the highest levels compared with the lowest. Both the case-con- trol studies and the ecological study showed decreased risk with incr eased intak e. Folic acid supplements do not show aprotective effect. Folate plays an important role in the synthesis and repair of DNA .Thereis a known interaction between folate and 273CHAPTER 7 CANCERS alcohol and the risk of some cancers (see chapter 4.8). Folate intake is strongly correlated with intake of non-starchy poly- saccharide or dietary fibre. The evidence available is sparse but a dose-response relationship was apparent from cohort studies. There islimited evidence suggesting that foods containing folate protect against pancreatic cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study109has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.6.5.3 Red meat (Also see chapter 4.3.5.1.1.) Seven cohort studies and four case-control studies investi-gated red meat. Nearly all of the studies showed increased risk with increased intake. Red meat contains haem iron. Free iron can lead to the pro- duction of fr ee radicals (see bo x4.3.3). When cook ed at high temperatures, red meat can also contain heterocyclic amines and polycyclic ar omatic hydr ocarbons (see bo x4.3.4). Evidence from cohort studies is less consistent than that from case-control studies. There is limitedevidence suggesting that red meat is a cause ofpancreatic cancer. The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study110has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see bo x3.8. 7.6.5.4 Coffee (Also see chapter 4.7.5.4.) Eighteen cohort studies, 37 case-control studies, and 11 eco-logical studies investigated coffee. Analysis of cohort datashowed an effect estimate close to null with low hetero-geneity. Data for case-control studies were less consistent. Thereis ample evidence, including pr ospective data, which is consistent and with low heter ogeneity ,and which fails to show an association. It is unlikely that coffee has a substantial effect on the risk of pancreaticcancer . 7.6.5.5 Physical activity (Also see chapter 5.4.5.) Atotal of three cohort studies and one case-control study investigated total physical activity; three cohort studies andtwo case-contr ol studies investigated occupational activity ; and nine cohort studies and three case-control studies inves- tigated recreational activity. Several studies also examinedwalking and transportation. Most of the studies showed decreased risk with increased physical activity, though there was heter ogeneity in the direction of effect and no clear dose-r esponse r elationship. Sustained moderate physical activity raises the metabolic rate and increases maximal oxygen uptake. In the long term,regular periods of such activity incr ease the body 's metabolicefficiency and capacity (the amount of work that it can per- form), as well as reducing blood pressure and insulin resis- tance. In addition, low levels of physical activity decrease gastrointestinal transit times. This alters bile content andsecretion, as well as affecting pancreatic activity. 111 There is evidence from prospective studies showing lower risk of pancreatic cancer with higher levels ofvarious types of physical activity, but it is ratherinconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting thatphysical activity protects against pancreatic cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study112has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.6.5.6 Body fatness (Also see chapter 6.1.3.1.) Twenty-three cohort studies and 15 case-control studiesinvestigated body fatness, as measur ed by BMI. Most cohort studies showed increased risk with increased body fatness, but case-contr ol studies wer einconsistent. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 14 per cent increased risk per 5 kg/m 2 (figure 6.1.4). Heterogeneity appeared to be explained by a number of studies failing to adjust for smoking, which is sep-arately associated with both BMI and pancreatic cancer. It is biologically plausible that body fatness is a cause of pancr eatic cancer. There is an established connection between incr easing BMI or body fatness and insulin r esis- tance and diabetes. The risk of this cancer is increased in people with insulin r esistance or diabetes. It also dir ectly affects levels of many circulating hormones, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and oestrogens, creating an envi-ronment that encourages car cinogenesis and discourages apoptosis (see box 2.4). Body fatness stimulates the inflam- matory response, which may contribute to the initiation andprogression of several cancers (see chapter 2.4.1.3). Thereis ample epidemiological evidence, which is generally eis a dose-r esponse relationship. Ther eis evidence for plausible mechanisms that operate in humans. The evidence that greater body fatness is a cause of pancreaticcancer is convincing. The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies58 112have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.6.5.7 Abdominal fatness (Also see chapter 6.1.3.2.) Three cohort studies investigated waist circumference, twocohort studies investigated waist to hip ratio, and one cohort study investigated patterns of weight gain, all of which showed incr eased risk with increasing measures of abdom- inal fatness. Half of all studies wer estatistically significant. The general mechanisms through which abdominal fatness could plausibly cause cancer are outlined in chapter 6.1.3(also see bo x2.4). The hormonal and other biological effects 274PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS of being overweight or obese are outlined in chapter 8. Many of these, such as increased circulating oestrogens and decreased insulin sensitivity, are associated with abdominal fatness independently of overall body fatness. There is a substantial amount of epidemiological evidence that is generally consistent, and there is evidence for plausible mechanisms. Abdominal fatnessis a probable cause of pancreatic cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study112has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.6.5.8 Adult attained height (Also see chapter 6.2.3.1.) Eight cohort studies, 12 case-control studies, and 1 ecolog- ical study investigated adult attained height. Most cohort studies and the single ecological study showed increased riskwith gr eater adult attained height. Case-contr ol studies wer e inconsistent. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed an 11 per cent incr eased risk per 5 cm of height (figur e6.2.5). Ther e was considerable heterogeneity in case-control data, not all readily explained. However, the cohort studies showed a lin-ear dose-response relationship (figure 6.2.6). The general mechanisms through which the factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences,could plausibly influence cancer risk ar eoutlined in chapter 6.2.1.3 (for mor edetail see bo x2.4). Many of these, such as early-life nutrition, altered hormone profiles, and the rate of sexual maturation ,could plausibly incr ease cancer risk. There is ample prospective epidemiological evidence, though ther eis some inconsistency .Thereis evidence for a dose-response relationship, and evidence for plausible mechanisms. The factors that lead to greateradult attained height, or its consequences, areprobably a cause of pancreatic cancer. The causalfactor is unlik ely to be tallness itself, but factors that promote linear gr owth in childhood. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study112has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.6.5.9 Other exposur es Other exposur es wer eevaluated. However ,the data wer e either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number of studies too few to allow conclusions to be reached. Thesewereasfollows: cer eals (grains) and their the case of alcoholic drinks, although low-to-moderate lev- els of drinking were unlikely to have an effect on risk, it couldnot be ex cluded that heavy drinking might have an effect.7.6.6 Comparison with previous report 7.6.6.1 General See 7.1.6.1, and box 3.8 in chapter 3. 7.6.6.2 Specific Apart from vegetables and fruits, the strongest evidence and judgements here are remarkably different from the previous report. Much of the evidence on body fatness, abdominal fat-ness, attained adult height (tallness), and physical activity isrecent. 7.6.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The evidence that body fatness is a cause of cancer of the pancreas is convincing; abdominal fatness is probably a cause of this cancer. Foods containing folate (but not folic acid supplements) probably protect against pancreatic cancer. The factors that lead to gr eater adult attained height, or its consequences, are probably a cause of this cancer. Greater height is unlikely to directly modify the risk of cancer; it isamarker for genetic, environmental, hormonal, and also nutritional factors affecting growth during the period frompreconception to completion of linear growth. It is unlik ely that coffee has any substantial effect on risk. Thereis limited evidence suggesting that fruits and also physical activity protect against this cancer, and that red meat is a cause of this cancer . 275CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.7 Gallbladder Cancer of the gallbladder accounts for somewhat over 2per cent of all cancer incidence and rates are generally declining. The highest rates occur in eastern Asia and eastern Europe, but it is rare in Africa. This cancer isusually fatal and is the 17th most common cause of cancer death. The Panel judges as follows: Body fatness is probably a cause of cancer of thegallbladder and people with gallstones are more likely todevelop gallbladder cancer. See chapter 8 for evidence and judgements on factors that modify the risk of body fatness, including physical activity and sedentary ways of life, the energy density of foods and drinks, and breastfeeding. In final summary ,the str ongest evidence, corr esponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\", shows that body fatness is pr obably a cause of gallbladder cancer , both directly and indirectly, through the formation of gallstones. The gallbladder is a small sac-like organ that forms part of the biliar ytract. Bile, produced in the liver, flows into the gallbladder ,wher eit is stored and concentrated until released into the small intestine. Morethan 90 per cent of gallbladder cancers ar eadeno - carcinomas, while only a small proportion are squamous cell carcinomas.4 7.7.1 Trends, incidence, and survival Age-adjusted rates of gallbladder cancer are decreasing.1 Even in many of the countries wher eincidence had been rel- atively high, such as in eastern Asia and eastern Eur ope, rates have decr eased and continued to fall, following a dramatic rise in the 1970s and 1980s. There is no clear geographical pattern to the distribution of gallbladder cancer .Age-adjusted incidence rates range from 5-10 per 100 000 people in parts of eastern Asia and eastern Eur ope to less than 1 per 10 0 000 in parts of Africa. In the US A,rates ar ehigher among both Native- and Hispanic-American people than in white people.113Around most of the world, gallbladder cancer is slightly more com-mon in women than men .In Japan and K orea, this tr end is reversed, with around 60 per cent of cases in men. 103Risk increases with age, with more than two thirds of cases occur-ring in people aged 65 years or older. 114 Gallbladder cancer is usually advanced at diagnosis. Survival rates are poor: at 5 years less than 12 per cent for advanced disease, but this is much higher (by up to 20 percent) when the cancer is caught early. Gallbladder cancer accounts for just over 2 per cent of all cancer incidence, andthe same pr oportion of all cancer deaths. Also see bo x7.1.1.7.7.2 Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of gallbladder cancer is not well under- stood, partly because it is often diagnosed at a late stage. Having gallstones incr eases the risk of this cancer .The associated inflammation decr eases the speed at which bile empties from the gallbladder; gallstones may also have a direct effect by blocking the transit of bile.115Gallstones, like gallbladder cancers, ar emore common in women than men, and the risk of cancer is proportional to the size of the gall- stones.116However ,other factors must also be involved: in high-income countries up to 1 person in 10 has gallstones(many asymptomatic), 117whereas gallbladder cancer is diag- nosed in only around 1 in 50 000. Many to xins, whether they come fr om diet, smok einhala - tion, or other environmental sources (and their metabolic products) are excreted and concentrated in the bile. Early stages of the disease include plaque-like lesions and small ulcerations in the mucosal lining of the gallbladder, which ar eassociated with chronic inflammation (cholecys- titis). This may pr ogress to car cinoma in situ, and then to invasive tumours. This process probably takes at least 20 years (cholecystitis is seldom seen in people under 40),hence the age pr ofile of gallbladder cancer .Chronic inflam- FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE GALLBLADDER In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the gallbladder.

Mutations of the tumour-suppressor p53 gene are fre-quent in gallbladder cancers (see box 2.2). 121 7.7.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1 of this chapter.) Other diseases .Having gallstones increases the risk of gall- bladder cancer and can be identified as a cause of this can- cer.

'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio sures of effect, cancer of the gallbladder include: Confounding .Having gallstones increases the risk of gall- bladder cancer. Exposures with an apparent link to gall-bladder cancer may act indir ectly, through gallstones, or directly,either after gallstone formation or in their absence. It is not yet possible to separate these effects. See 7.7.7. 7.7.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 48 publications wer eincluded in the SLR for gall - bladder cancer .Fuller summaries of the epidemiological, experimental, and mechanistic evidence are to be found in Chapters 4-6. Thefull SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.7.5.1 Body fatness (Also see chapter 6.1.3.1.) Five cohort studies, seven case-control studies, and two cross-sectional studies investigated body fatness, as mea - sured by BMI. Most studies showed increased risk with increased body fatness. Meta-analysis of cohort data showeda23per cent incr eased risk per 5 kg/m 2;meta-analysis ofcase-control data showed a 19 per cent increased risk per 5 kg/m2.Heterogeneity could be partly attributed to differ- ences in the study participants' ethnicity or sex, or to the number of adjustments made in the study. Body fatness directly affects levels of many circulating hor- mones, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and oestrogens, creating an environment that encourages car- cinogenesis and discourages apoptosis (see box 2.4). It also stimulates the body's inflammatory response, which maycontribute to the initiation and progression of several can- cers (see chapter 2.4.1.3). In addition, obesity is a known cause of gallstone formation, and having gallstones increas- es the risk of gallbladder cancer, possibly through bile cho- lesterol supersaturation. Because having gallstones is a cause of gallbladder can- cer, the Panel also reviewed the dietary causes of gallstones, especially in relation to body fatness. Having a relatively high BMI increases the risk of gallstones in a linear fashion; waist circumference is associated with gallstone risk in men, inde-pendently of BMI. Gallstone formation is associated with repeated dieting, especially where it involves rapid weightloss, such as that fr om ver ylow-ener gy diets and bariatric surgery. There is a substantial amount of generally consistent epidemiological evidence with some evidence of adose-response relationship. There is evidence forseveral plausible mechanisms. Gr eater body fatness is aprobable cause of gallbladder cancer ,directly and also indirectly through the formation of gallstones. 7.7.5.2 Other exposures Other exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either of too low quality ,too inconsistent, or the number of studies too few to allow conclusions to be reached. These included capsicums, fish, coffee, tea, alcohol, and vitamin C. 7.7.6 Comparison with pr evious report 7.7.6.1 General See 7.1.6.1, and box 3.8 of chapter 3. 7.7.6.2 Specific Since publication of the previous report, the evidence that body fatness is an indir ect and a dir ect cause of gallbladder cancer has str engthened. 7.7.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : Greater body fatness is probably a cause of cancer of the gall- bladder. People with gallstones are more likely to develop gallbladder cancer . 277CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.8 Liver Cancer of the liver is the sixth most common type of cancer worldwide. Around 625 000 cases were recorded in2002, accounting for around 6 per cent of all cancers. About half of all cases occur in China, and it is morecommon in middle- and low-income countries. It is almostalways fatal, and is the third most common cause of deathfrom cancer, accounting for around 9 per cent of all deaths. Overall, the Panel notes that toxic compounds are the main causes of primary liver cancer related to foods anddrinks. The Panel judges as follows: Theevidence that aflatoxins, which contaminate mostly cereals (grains) and pulses (legumes) stored in hot, wetconditions, ar eacause of liver cancer is convincing. Alcoholic drinks are probably a direct cause of this cancer.Thereis limited evidence suggesting that fruits ar e protective, and that body fatness is a cause of this cancer. Other causes of this cancer include infection with hepatitis viruses B or C, the development of cirrhosis fromany cause, and infestation with liver flukes. In final summary, the strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"pr obable\", shows that aflato xins, and pr obably alcoholic drinks, are causes of liver cancer. The liver is the body 's largest or gan.It processes and stor es nutrients, and produces cholesterol and proteins such as albumin, clotting factors, and the lipoproteins that carry cho-lesterol. It also secretes bile and performs many metabolicfunctions, including detoxification of several classes of car-cinogen . Differ ent types of tumour occur in the liver .Each has potentially differ ent causes and natural histor y. Around 75-90 per cent of liver cancers are hepatocellular carcino- ma. This starts in hepatocytes, which are the commonesttype of liver cell, and has various subtypes. Cholangio - carcinomas account for 10-20 per cent of primary liver can- cers. These cancers start in the small bile ducts (tubes thatcarrybile to the gallbladder) within the liver .Hepato - blastoma and angiosarcoma are less common types of liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the main type includedhere.Secondar ytumours of the liver ar enot included.7.8.1 T rends, incidence, and survival Age-adjusted rates of liver cancer are either increasing or sta- ble in most countries for which data are available.6122However, arecent report on trends in the USA between 1975 and 2001 suggested that these increases may now be reversing.3 This is pr edominantly a disease of middle- to low-income countries, wher eoverall rates ar emorethan double those in high-income countries. Around the world, age-adjusted incidence rates range from more than 40 per 100 000 peo-ple in eastern Asia and parts of Africa to less than 5 per 100 000 in the Americas and northern Europe. 2In the USA, rates are higher among African-American and Hispanic-American people, and Asian and Pacific Islanders, than in white people. 3Globally, rates are higher in men than women by five to two . Risk tends to incr ease with age, although the disease develops at a younger age (typically around the age of 40, or below) in people living in Asia and Africa compared withthose in high-income countries. 123 FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE LIVER In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the liver. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence. DECREASES RISK INCREASES RISK Convincing Aflatoxins1 Probable Alcoholic drinks2 Limited \u2014 Fruits3Body fatness suggestive Limited Cereals peanuts (groundnuts)1;fish; salted fish; water source; coffee; tea Substantial effect on risk None identified unlikely 1 Foods that may be contaminated with aflatoxins include cereals (grains), and also pulses (legumes), seeds, nuts, and some vegetables and fruits (see chapter 4.2). 2Cirrhosis is an essential pr ecursor of liver cancer caused by alcohol. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has graded alcohol as a Class 1 carcinogen for liver cancer. Alcohol alone only causes cirrhosis in the presence of other susceptibility factors. 3 Judgements on vegetables and fruits do not include those preserved by salting and/or pickling. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossar y. 278PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS The early stages of liver cancer do not usually produce symptoms, so the disease is generally advanced when it isdiagnosed. Survival rates are poor: at 5 years, approximately5per cent. 124This cancer accounts for almost 6 per cent of all cancer incidence, but ar ound 9 per cent of all cancer deaths.2Also see bo x7.1.1. 7.8.2 Pathogenesis Liver cancer generally follows cirrhosis, so any cause of cir- rhosis \u2014 either viral (see bo x7.8.1) or chemical \u2014 is like- ly to incr ease cancer risk. Appr oximately 80 per cent of hepatocellular carcinoma cases develop in cirrhotic livers.123 As for cancers at most sites, accumulated sequential changes (see chapter 2.5), specifically in matur ehepato cytes, lead to the development of dysplastic nodules; over the course of around 5 years, 30 per cent may develop intotumours. 125Hepatocellular carcinoma cells show numerous genetic changes, perhaps accumulated during cellular pro- liferation ,which is part of the normal liver repair process.126 The hepatitis B virus-r elated type (see bo x7.8.1) appears to be more genetically unstable than others.127 128 The liver is a common site for metastasis of tumours orig- inating in other or gans.7.8.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) Other diseases .Cirrhosis of the liver increases the risk of, and so can be seen as a cause of, liver cancer. Infection and infestation .Chronic viral hepatitis is a cause of liver cancer (see box 7.8.1).130Infestation with liver flukes is a cause of cholangiocarcinoma. Medication .Oral contraceptives containing high doses of oestro- gen and progesterone may be a cause of this cancer.90 133 7.8.4 Interpretation of the evidence 7.8.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and bo xes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this R eport to denote ratio mea - specific to cancer of the liver include: Classification .Most of the data is on hepatocellular car ci- noma, the most well characterised (and most common) form of liver cancer .However ,differ ent outcomes ar ereported for unspecified primary liver cancer, compared with hepato- cellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma. This suggestsdiffer ent causation and so may ther eforebe a cause of heterogeneity. Confounding .Hepatitis B and C viruses are possible con- founders or effect modifiers; high-quality studies adjust forthem. Not all studies do so . Measur ement .Owing to low sur vival rates, both incidence and mortality can be assessed. Low survival times and rates decrease the reliability of case-control studies, which oftenrely on proxy reporting. 7.8.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 273 publications were included in the SLR for liver cancer .Fuller summaries of the epidemiological, experi - mental, and mechanistic evidence are to be found in Chapters 4-6. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.8.5.1 Fr uits (Also see chapter 4.2.5.2.) One cohort study and five case-control studies investigatedfruits. The cohort study and most of the case-contr ol stud - Hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses are causes of liver cancer. The former appears to act directly by damaging cells and their DNA. The latter shows an indirect effect, mediated by cirrhosis. For both, there is potential for nutrition status to have an effect at several stages: susceptibility to and duration of infection, liver damage, DNA damage, and cancer progression.129 Around 7-8 per cent of the world's population is estimated to beinfected with hepatitis B virus. It is mostly spread by blood and sexual transmission. In endemic areas, the carrier rate may be10-20 per cent.130Itisoften acquired at birth or in childhood, and is endemic in areas of Africa and Asia. Chronic hepatitis B virus carriers have a 100-fold greater chance of developing liver cancer than non-carriers. Those infected in adulthood have alower risk of this cancer than those infected in childhood because there is less time for the virus to cause inflammation. 130 Vaccination against hepatitis B virus has been shown to reduce the prevalence of liver cancer by 60 per cent.131 Liver cancer in hepatitis B virus carriers is not necessarily con- nected with cir rhosis: up to 40 per cent of associated liver can- cer cases are non-cirrhotic. Hepatitis B virus carries its genetic code as DNA rather than RNA. V iral DNA can inser titself into liver cells and alter their DNA. Around 3 per cent of the world's population is estimated to be infected with hepatitis C virus. It is more prevalent in high-income countries. Appr oximately 80 per cent of these infections become chronic, of which 15-20 per cent develops into cirrho- sis. Of those, 1-4 per cent develops into liver cancer each year.Interruption of the sequence of chronic hepatitis developing into cirrhosis prevents liver cancer. Also, there is an interaction between hepatitis C vir us infection, liver cancer risk, and con- sumption of alcoholic drinks. 132Ther eis no vaccine against hepatitis C. It is mostly spread by blood. Box 7.8.1 Hepatitis viruses 279CHAPTER 7 CANCERS ies showed decreased risk with increased fruit intake. No studies showed statistically significant increased risk. Fruits are sources of vitamin C and other antioxidants, such as carotenoids, phenols, and flavonoids, as well bioactive phytochemicals. Antioxidants trap free radicals and reactive oxygen molecules, protecting against oxidation damage. In addition, flavonoids found in fruit directly inhibit the expression of a cytochrome P450 enzyme, which helps tometabolise toxins and has been associated with increased risk of lung cancer, primarily in smokers. 68Itis difficult to unravel the relative importance of each constituent and is likely that a protective effect may result from a com- bination of influences on several pathways involved incarcinogenesis. The evidence is sparse and inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that fruits protect against liver cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-contr ol study134has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.8.5.2 Aflatoxins (Also see chapter 4.1.5.4.) Five cohort studies and seven case-control studies investi-gated biomark ers of exposure to aflatoxins. All of the cohort studies and most of the case-contr ol studies showed increased risk with elevated measures of exposure. Most cohort studies showed significant dose-r esponse r elation - ships, although the variety of measures used prevented meta- analysis. Effect estimates ranged from a three- to sevenfoldincreased risk for the highest measur es of exposur e. There is strong mechanistic evidence through the meta- bolic product of aflatoxin B1, which is known to be geno-toxic and is formed in the liver. It directly damages DNA,forming adducts. The activity of GST enzymes can result inlower levels of adducts with var ying efficiency between genotypes. Ther eis clear and consistent evidence that GST - positive genotypes pr otect against the incr eased risk of liver cancer from hepatitis infection combined with aflatoxin exposure. This supports a causal role for aflatoxin B1 inhepatocellular car cinoma. The evidence is ample and consistent and is supported by str ong evidence for mechanisms operating in humans. A dose-response relationship is apparent from both cohort and case-control studies. The evidence that aflato xins and aflato xin-contaminated foods ar ea cause of liver cancer is convincing. 7.8.5.3 Alcoholic drinks (Also see chapter 4.8.5.1.) Atotal of 15 cohort studies and 33 case-contr ol studies inves- tigated alcoholic drinks, and 14 cohort studies and 21 case-control studies investigated total ethanol intake. Most studies showed increased risk with increased alcohol intake, withnone r eporting statistically significant decr eased risk. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 10 per cent increased risk per 10 g ethanol/day. Meta-analysis of case-control data showed an 18 per cent increased risk per drink/week, or a 17 per cent increased risk per 10 g ethanol/day (figures4.8.18-4.8.19). Heterogeneity in case-control studies may be explained by alcoholic behaviour, by proxy reporting, or by failure to adjust for hepatitis virus status. Several studies used partic- ipants judged to be at high risk of developing liver cancer(people who already had liver cirrhosis). These results are particularly difficult to interpret as cirrhosis status affects drinking behaviour. Also, the cancer disease path may be dif- ferent in people with cirrhosis. It is biologically highly plausible that alcoholic drinks are acause of liver cancer. Reactive metabolites of alcohol such as acetaldehyde can be carcinogenic. DNA mutations may beless efficiently repaired in the presence of alcohol. Alcohol may also function as a solvent, enhancing penetration of other carcinogenic molecules into cells. Additionally, theeffects of alcohol may be mediated thr ough the pr oduction of prostaglandins, lipid peroxidation, and the generation of free radical o xygen species. Lastly ,heavy consumers of alco - hol may have diets low in essential nutrients, making tissues susceptible to carcinogenesis. In addition, regular, high lev-els of alcohol consumption are known to cause liver dam-age. Tumour promotion has been linked to inflammation inthe liver through alcohol-associated fibrosis and hepatitis.Alcohol consumption ,even at moderate levels, is associat- ed with incr eases in levels of cir culating hepatitis C virus RNA in carriers of this infection. This infection is highly prevalent among alcoholics with chr onic liver disease, and appears to accelerate the course of alcoholic liver disease. Thereis ample, generally consistent evidence fr om both cohort and case-control studies. A dose-responserelationship is apparent. Alcohol is a cause of cirrhosis,which predisposes to liver cancer, but the factors thatdetermine why some people are susceptible tocirrhosis are not known. Alcoholic drinks are a probable cause of liver cancer .No threshold was identified. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-contr ol study135has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.8.5.4 Body fatness (Also see chapter 6.1.3.1). Six cohort studies and two case-control studies investigatedbody fatness, as measur ed by BMI, or obesity .All cohort stud - ies showed increased risk with increased body fatness, except in one subgroup of African-American men. There was sub-stantial heterogeneity and none of the studies adjusted for hepatitis virus status. The two case-control studies provid- ed no clear evidence of any effect. Body fatness dir ectly affects levels of many cir culating hor - mones, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and oestrogens, creating an environment that encourages car-cinogenesis and discourages apoptosis (see bo x2.4). It stim - 280PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS ulates the body's inflammatory response, which may con- tribute to the initiation and progression of several cancers (see chapter 2.4.1.3). The epidemiological evidence shows some inconsistencies and the mechanistic evidence isspeculative. There is limited evidence suggesting that greater body fatness is a cause of liver cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies58 136have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.8.5.5 Other exposures Other exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number ofstudies too few to allow conclusions to be reached. These were as follows: cereals (grains) and their products; non- starchy vegetables; peanuts; fish; salted fish; water source;coffee; and tea. In cases of cereals (grains) and peanuts, there are data con- necting these foods to liver cancer ,but the P anel judges that any causative factor is likely to be aflatoxins. 7.8.6 Comparison with previous report 7.8.6.1 General See 7.1.6.1, and bo x3.8 in chapter 3. 7.8.6.2 Specific Since publication of the previous report, the evidence that aflatoxin contamination of food is a cause of liver cancer isstronger and now justifies a judgement of 'convincing'. 7.8.7 Conclusions The P anel concludes : The evidence is convincing that aflato xins, which contami - nate mostly cer eals (grains) and pulses (legumes), usually as a result of long storage in hot, wet conditions, are a cause ofliver cancer. Alcoholic drinks ar eprobably a cause of liver cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that fruits are pro- tective, and that body fatness is a cause of this cancer .7.9 Colon and rectum Cancers of the colon and rectum are the third most common type worldwide. Around 1 million cases wererecorded in 2002, accounting for around 9 per centoverall. Rates of this cancer increase with industrialisationand urbanisation. It has been much more common in high- income countries but is now increasing in middle- and low-income countries. It remains relatively uncommon inAfrica and much of Asia. It is somewhat more common inmen than in women. It is fatal in just under half of allcases and is the fourth most common cause of death fromcancer. Overall, the Panel judges that food and nutrition have a highly important role in the prevention and causation ofcancers of the colon and r ectum (her etermed colorectum). The Panel judges as follows: The evidence that physical activity protects againstcolorectal cancer is convincing, although the evidence isstronger for colon than for rectum. The evidence that redmeat, processed meat, substantial consumption of alcoholicdrinks (in men), body fatness and abdominal fatness, andthe factors that lead to gr eater adult attained height, or its consequences, are causes of colorectal cancer isconvincing. Substantial consumption of alcoholic drinks isprobably a cause of this cancer in women. Foods containingdietary fibre, and garlic, milk, and calcium probably protectagainst this cancer . There is limited evidence suggesting that non-starchy vegetables, fruits, foods containing folate, fish, foodscontaining vitamin D, and selenium and foods containing itprotect against colorectal cancer, and that foods containingiron, cheese, foods containing animal fats, and foods containing sugars ar ecauses of this cancer . See chapter 8 for evidence and judgements on factors that modify the risk of body fatness and abdominal fatness,including physical activity and sedentary ways of life, theenergy density of foods and drinks, and breastfeeding. It has been estimated that this cancer is mostly preventable by appr opriate diets and associated factors. In final summary ,the str ongest evidence, corr esponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\",shows that physical activity protects against colorectal cancer. The evidence also shows that r ed meat and pr ocessed meat, substantial consumption of alcoholic drinks (by men and probably by women), body fatness and abdominal fatness, and the factors that lead to greater adult attained height,or its consequences, are causes of this cancer. Foodscontaining dietary fibr e, and also garlic, milk, and calcium, probably pr otect against this cancer . 281CHAPTER 7 CANCERS The colon is the lower part of the intestinal tract. It extends from the caecum to the rectum. In the colon, water and salts areabsorbed from undigested foods, and muscles move the waste pr oducts towar ds the r ectum. The colon contains a vast population of many types of bacteria, which have potential- ly important functions. These include the fermentation ofunabsorbed carbohydrate (non-star ch polysaccharides andresistant starch) to release energy and short chain fatty acids that influence the health of the colonic mucosa. It may also be infected with harmful types of bacteria. The colon is linedwith mucous membranes, and also contains lymphoid cells that form part of the body's immune defences. Approximately 95 per cent of colorectal cancers are ade- nocar cinomas. Other types of cancer that can occur her e FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCERS OF THE COLON AND THE RECTUM Inthe judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancers of the colon and the rectum. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence.

The Panel judges that the evidence is stronger for colon than for rectum. 3The ter m'red meat' r efers to beef, pork, lamb, and goat fr om domesticated animals. 4 Although red and processed meats contain iron, the general category of 'foods containing iron' comprises many other foods, including those of plant origin. 5The ter m'processed meat' r efers to meats pr eserved by smoking, curing, or salting, or addition of chemical preservatives. 6The judgements for men and women ar edifferent because there are fewer data for women. Increased risk is only apparent above a threshold of 30 g/day of ethanol for both sexes. 7 Adult attained height is unlikely directly to modify the risk of cancer. It is a marker for genetic, environmental, hormonal, and also nutritional factors affecting growth during the period from preconception to completion of linear growth (see chapter 6.2.1.3). 8 Includes both foods naturally containing the constituent and foods which have the constituent added (see chapter 3.5.3). Dietary fibre is contained in plant foods (see box 4.1.2 and chapter 4.2). 9 Judgements on vegetables and fruits do not include those preserved by salting and/or pickling. 10 Although both milk and cheese ar eincluded in the general categor yof dair yproducts, their dif ferent nutritional composition and consumption patterns may result in different findings. 11 Milk from cows. Most data are from high-income populations, where calcium can be taken to be a marker for milk/dairy consumption. The Panel judges that a higher intake of dietary calcium is one way in which milk could have a protective effect. 12 The evidence is derived from studies using supplements at a dose of 1200 mg/day.13 Found mostly in fortified foods and animal foods. 14 The evidence is derived fr om studies using supplements at a dose of 200 \u00b5g/day. Selenium is toxic at high doses. 15 'Sugars' here means all 'non-milk extrinsic' sugars, including refined and other added sugars, honey, and as contained in fruit juices and syrups. It does not include sugars naturally present in whole foods such as fruits. It also does not include lactose as contained in animal or human milks. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. 282PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS include mucinous carcinomas and adenosquamous carcino- mas.4Adenocarcinomas are covered here. A systematic review of colorectal adenomas was conducted to understand the contribution of food, nutrition, and physical activity tothe pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, and contributed to interpretation of the underlying mechanisms. 7.9.1 Trends, incidence, and survival There is no clear trend in global age-adjusted rates of col- orectal cancer. There has, however, been a rapid increase in rates in high-income countries that have recently made the transition from a relatively low-income economy, such asJapan, Singapore, and eastern European countries. Rateshave at least doubled in many of these countries since themid-1970s. 137Colorectal cancer is mainly a disease of high- income countries, where overall rates are nearly four times higher than in middle- to low-income countries. Around theworld, age-adjusted incidence rates range fr om mor ethan 40 per 100 000 people in North America, parts of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan to less than 5 per 100 000 in much of Africa, Central America, and parts of Asia. 2In the USA, rates are higher among African-American people than in white people.3This disease is slightly more common in men than in women, by seven to five. Riskincreases with age until old age, when it levels off. 6 Color ectal cancer often produces symptoms at an early enough stage to mak eit treatable, meaning that survival rates are relatively high. In addition, regular screening is common in some countries such as the US A.The 5-year over - all survival rate averages 50 per cent, with 55 per cent in high-income countries and 39 per cent in middle- to low-income countries. 124This cancer accounts for somewhat over 9per cent of all cancer incidence, but around 8 per cent of all cancer deaths. Also see box 7.1.1. 7.9.2 Pathogenesis Carcinogens ingested as part of ,or with, foods and drinks can interact directly with the cells that line the colon and rec- tum if they are not metabolised or absorbed in the smallintestine. Color ectal cancer can also develop from a back- ground of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease). 138 Between 5 and 10 per cent of color ectal cancers ar eacon- sequence of recognised hereditary conditions. The major familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) andHNPCC 139(also see 7.5.2). A further 20 per cent of cases occur in people who have a family history of colorectal can- cer.139People with FAP develop a large number of adenomas at a relatively young age; if left untreated, nearly all will develop colorectal cancer by the time they reach 40.140 On average, people develop HNPCC in their mid-40s140; having this form of the disease incr eases the risk of a number of other gastrointestinal cancers. HNPCC involves mutations in DNA repair genes, a recognised step in the developmentof many color ectal cancers.There are two characterised pathways to colorectal cancer, although they are likely to be linked \u2014 the 'gatekeeper' and the 'caretaker' pathways. 141The gatekeeper pathway is involved in 85 per cent of sporadic colorectal cancers, andis the one associated with FAP . 140It involves the disruption of genes that regulate growth, and for colorectal cancer, the key one is the tumour-suppressor gene APC. The caretaker pathway is characterised by disruption to genes that main- tain genetic stability. It leads to 15 per cent of sporadic can-cers, and is involved in the development of HNPCC. 140 Several tumour-suppressor genes are mutated in this path- way142(also see box 2.2 in chapter 2). 7.9.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) Other diseases .Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) incr ease the risk of ,and so may be seen as a cause of, colon cancer. Medication .Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and hormone replacement therapy in postmeno-pausal women have been shown to decrease colon cancerrisk. 143 144 7.9.4 Interpr etation of the evidence 7.9.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2,3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio sures of to color ectal cancer include: Classification .Cancers in different parts of the colon and in the rectum could have different pathogeneses and differentcausal agents. 7.9.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 752 publications were included in the SLR for can- cers of the colon and r ectum. F uller summaries of the epi - demiological, experimental, and mechanistic evidence are to be found in Chapters 4-6. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.9.5.1 Foods containing dietar yfibre (Also see chapter 4.1.5.3.) Sixteen cohort studies and 91 case-control studies investi-gated dietar yfibre. Most studies showed decr eased risk with 283CHAPTER 7 CANCERS increased intake. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 10 per cent decreased risk per 10 g/day (see figure 4.1.1). Heterogeneity may be caused by variation in the definition of dietary fibre between studies. A pooled analysis of 8100colorectal cancer cases among 730 000 participants, fol- lowed up for 6-20 yeas, showed a non-significant decreased risk for the groups that consumed the most dietary fibre. Data come predominantly from dietary sources, not supple- ments; therefore no effect can be attributed specifically tofibre, which is interpreted simply as a marker of consump- tion of foods containing it, although specific mechanisms have been identified. Fibre exerts several effects in the gastrointestinal tract, but the precise mechanisms for its probable protective role arestill not clearly understood. Fibre dilutes faecal content,decreases increases stool weight.Fermentation products, especially short-chain fatty acids, are produced by the gut flora from a wide range of dietary car- bohydrates and mucins that reach the colon. Short-chainfatty acids, such as butyrate, induce apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and differentiation in experimental studies. Fibreintak eis also str ongly corr elated with intak eof folate, though adjusting for this often does not affect the risk reduction attributed to fibre. Aclear dose-response relationship is apparent from generally consistent cohort studies, supported byevidence for plausible mechanisms, but r esidual confounding could not be ex cluded. F oods containing dietary fibre probably protect against colorectal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, seven cohort studies145-151and one case-control study152have been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.9.5.2 Non-starchy vegetables (Also see chapter 4.2.5.1.) Seventeen cohort studies and 71 case-contr ol studies inves - tigated non-star chy vegetables. Although meta-analysis of cohort data produced no evidence of an association, a com- parison of the groups with the highest intakes against thosewith the lowest was suggestive of an association . This is a wide and disparate category, and many different plant food constituents ar erepresented that could contribute to a pr otective effect of non-star chy vegetables. potentially antioxidants. Antioxidants trap free radicals and reactive oxygen molecules, protectingagainst oxidation damage. It is difficult to unravel the rela- tive importance of each constituent and it is likely that any protective effect may result from a combination of influences on several pathways involved in car cinogenesis. Asubstantial amount of evidence is available but it is inconsistent. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting thatnon-starchy vegetables protect against colorectal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, three case-control studies17152 154have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box3.8. 7.9.5.3 Garlic (Also see chapter 4.2.5.1.2.) Two cohort studies and six case-control studies investigatedgarlic. All studies reported decreased risk with increased intake, with none reporting contrary results. Most studies did not reach statistical significance, and meta-analysis was not possible. There is considerable preclinical evidence with model car- cinogens and transplantable tumours that supports an anti-cancer effect of garlic and some of its allyl sulphurcomponents. Animal studies demonstrate that allyl sulphides effectively inhibit colon tumour formation, and also can inhibit cell growth in laboratory experiments. The evidence, though not copious and mostly from case-contr ol studies, is consistent, with a dose- response relationship. There is evidence for plausiblemechanisms. Garlic probably protects againstcolorectal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-contr ol study17has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see bo x3.8. 7.9.5.4 Fr uits (Also see chapter 4.2.5.2.) Twenty cohort studies and 57 case-control studies investi-gated fruits. Mor ethan half of the cohort studies showed decreased risk with increased intake. Meta-analysis of cohort data produced no clear evidence of an overall association.However, stratification by sex did show a statistically sig-nificant decreased risk with increased intake among women,but not men . This differ ence could be hormone-r elated, speculating aconnection with the pr otective effects obser ved in postmenopausal women provided by hormone replacement therapy. Another possibility is that this could be artefactual:men may have not r eported their diets as accurately as women. Because of the abundant pr ospective data fr om cohort studies, case-contr ol studies wer enot summarised. Fruits are sources of vitamin C and other antioxidants, such as carotenoids, phenols, trap ee radicals and oxygen molecules, protecting against oxidation damage. In addition, flavonoids found in fruitdirectly inhibit the expression of a cytochrome P450 enzyme, which helps to metabolise toxins and has been asso- ciated with incr eased risk of lung cancer, primarily in smok- ers. 68It is difficult to unravel the r elative importance of each constituent and it is likely that a protective effect may result from a combination of influences on several pathwaysinvolved in car cinogenesis. 284PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS There is a substantial amount of evidence but it is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting thatfruits protect against colorectal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort147 153 155and five case control studies152 154 156-158have beenpublished. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.9.5.5 Foods containing folate (Also see chapter 4.2.5.4.) Nine cohort studies investigated dietary folate and two cohort studies investigated serum folate. Most studies showed decreased risk with increased intake. Meta-analysisof cohort data produced evidence of decreased risk with aclear dose-response relationship. Both studies that investi-gated serum folate levels, which may be a more accurate and precise measure than dietary estimates, showed decreased risk for colon cancer, but not rectal cancer; this was statisti-cally significant in one study .Data come pr edominantly fr om dietary sources, not supplements; therefore no effect can be attributed specifically to folate, which is interpr eted simply as a marker of consumption of foods containing it. Folate plays an important role in the synthesis, repair, and methylation of DNA. Abnormal DNA methylation has beenlinked to aberrant gene expression and also to cancers at sev-eral sites. Folate may also reduce HPV proliferation in cells(also see bo x7.13.1). In addition, folate intake is also strong- ly corr elated with intak eof dietary fibre, which probably pro- tects against colorectal cancer (see 7.9.5.1). The evidence from cohort studies is plentiful, with a dose-response relationship, but there is unexplainedinconsistency .Residual confounding fr om dietary fibr e ispossible. There is limited evidence suggesting that foods containing folate protect against colorectalcancer. The P anel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, four cohort159-163and two case contr ol studies152 164have been pub - lished. This new information does not change the P anel judge - ment. Also see box 3.8. 7.9.5.6 Foods containing selenium (Also see chapter 4.2.5.8.) Fifteen case-contr ol studies investigated dietary selenium, all of which showed decr eased risk with incr eased intak e. Meta- analysis of case-control data produced evidence of decreased risk with increased serum selenium levels, showing a cleardose-r esponse r elationship. Dietary selenium deficiency has been shown to cause a lack of selenoprotein expression. Twenty-five selenoproteinshave been identified in animals, and a number of these have important anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Four are glutathione peroxidases, which protect against oxidative damage to biomolecules such as lipids, lipopr o- teins, and DNA. Three are thioredoxin reductases, which regenerate oxidised ascorbic acid to its active antioxidantform, among other functions.Asubstantial amount of data was available, from case- control studies only. There is limited evidencesuggesting that foods containing selenium protectagainst colorectal cancer. 7.9.5.7 Red meat (Also see chapter 4.3.5.1.1.) Sixteen cohort and 71 case-control studies investigated red meat. Nearly all cohort studies showed increased risk withhigher intake. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 43 per cent increased risk per time consumed/week (figure 4.3.2) or a15 per cent increased risk per 50 g/day (figure 4.3.3). Heterogeneity could not be fully explained but some studies could have included processed meats in the 'red meat' category. There are several potential underlying mechanisms for a positive association of red meat consumption with colorectalcancer, including the generation of potentially carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds (see box 4.3.2). Some meats are also cooked at high temperatures, resulting in the production ofheter ocyclic amines and polycyclic ar 4.3.4). Red meat contains haem iron. Free iron can lead to the pr oduction of fr ee radicals (see bo x4.3.3). Asubstantial amount of data from cohort and case- control studies showed a dose-response relationship,supported by evidence for plausible mechanismsoperating in humans. Red meat is a convincing causeof color ectal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, six cohort165-173and four case-contr ol studies154 156 157 174have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.9.5.8 Processed meat (Also see chapter 4.3.5.1.2.) Fourteen cohort studies and 44 case-control studies investi-gated processed meat. Nearly all cohort studies showedincreased risk with higher intake. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 21 per cent incr eased risk per 50 g/day (fig - ure4.3.6). Heter ogeneity was low and explained by the dis- parity in category definitions between studies, as well as by improved adjustment for confounders in recent studies. Nitrates ar eboth produced endogenously in gastric acid and added as preservatives to processed meats. They may contribute to N-nitroso compound pr oduction and exposure. These compounds ar esuspected mutagens and car cinogens (see box 4.3.2).55Many processed meats also contain high levels of salt and nitrite. Meats cooked at high temperaturescan contain heter Haem promotes the formation of N-nitroso compounds and also contains iron. Free iron can lead to production of free radicals (see box 4.3.3). Thereis a substantial amount of evidence, with a dose- response r elationship appar ent fr om cohort studies. There is strong evidence for plausible mechanisms operating in humans. Processed meat is a convincingcause of color ectal cancer . 285CHAPTER 7 CANCERS The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, five cohort153 165-169 171 173 175and two case-control studies154 157have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.9.5.9 Fish (Also see chapter 4.3.5.3.) Nineteen cohort studies and 55 case-control studies investi- gated fish. Most cohort studies showed decreased risk withhigher intake. Meta-analysis showed a non-significant decreased risk. Heterogeneity may be partially explained by varying definitions of fish in different studies to include fresh and/or salted and dried fish. Also, high fish intake may be associated with low meat intake, which is a potential con-founder that has not been adjusted for. Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. It is biologically plausible that long-chain fish n-3 polyun- saturated fatty acids (PUFAs) protect against cancer (seechapter 2.4.1.3). F ish oils r educe tumours in animal stud - ies. 176Likely mechanisms are thought to include their role in reduction of n-6 P UFA-derived eicosanoid biosynthesis (eicosanoids influence inflammation) and direct inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2, also implicated in the cancer processThis mechanism, though plausible, is not well supported. 177 Alternative suggestions include the relatively high selenium or vitamin D content of fish. Asubstantial amount of data is available but the results are inconsistent, and residual confounding bymeat could not be ex cluded. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting that eating fish protects against colorectal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, six cohort147 165 167-169 171 178and two case-control studies152 154have been published. This new information does not change thePanel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.9.5.10 Foods containing vitamin D (Also see chapter 4.3.5.5.) Eleven cohort studies and 17 case-control studies investi- gated total vitamin D and/or dietary vitamin D. Four cohortstudies investigated plasma or serum vitamin D. Most of the studies of intake, and all of the studies of plasma or serum vitamin D, showed decr eased risk as measur es of intake increased. The effects of vitamin D and calcium are strongly interre- lated because both are growth restraining, both induce dif-ferentiation and apoptosis in intestinal cells, and calcium-mediated effects are strongly dependent on vitamin Dlevels. Data from observational studies were limited by the fact that levels of the biologically active form are not only dependent on diet but also on supplements, and ultraviolet (UV) exposur eof the skin. The evidence on vitamin D was inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that foods containing vitaminDor vitamin D status pr otect against color ectal cancer .The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two case-control studies152 179have been published. This new infor- mation does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.9.5.11 Foods containing iron (Also see chapter 4.3.5.6.) Four cohort studies and 23 case-control studies investigated iron intake. All cohort studies showed increased risk with increased intake, which was statistically significant in two. It is biologically plausible that iron increases colorectal can- cer risk due to its catalytic activity on the formation of reac- tive oxygen species. However, this role has not been confirmed in animal studies. Another hypothesis relates to dietary haem, which can induce colonic cytotoxicity andhyperproliferation. hypoxia signalling. 181Also see box 4.3.3. The evidence is sparse, of poor quality, and inconsistent. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting that foods containing iron are in general a cause ofcolor ectal cancer .(Also see chapter 4.3 for evidence specifically on red and processed meat, which are classified as convincing causes of colorectal cancer.) The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies175 182have been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.9.5.12 Milk (Also see chapter 4.4.5.1.2.) Thirteen cohort studies and 36 case-control studies investi- gated milk; 15 cohort studies and 58 case-control studiesinvestigated dietar ycalcium. Most cohort studies showed decreased risk with increased intake. A pooled analysis of 10 cohort studies (nearly 5000 colorectal cancer cases amongmore than 530 000 participants) showed a 15 per centdecreased risk for the groups that drank the most milk, anda14 per cent decr eased risk for the groups with the highest dietar ycalcium intak es. 183 Most of the evidence used her ecomes fr om Western coun- tries, where dietary calcium intake can be taken as a mark- er for dairy consumption. Any effect of milk in r educing colorectal cancer risk is likely to be mediated at least in part by calcium, which has direct growth-r estraining and differentiation- and apoptosis-inducing actions on normal and tumour color ectal cells.184Milk includes many bioactive constituents, which may also play a role. The evidence on milk fr om cohort studies is r easonably consistent, supported by stronger evidence from dietary calcium, as a dietary marker. There is evidence for plausible mechanisms. Milk probably protects againstcolorectal cancer. The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR ,three cohort185-188and three case-control studies154 158 189have been published. This new information does not change the Paneljudgement. Also see bo x3.8. 286PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 7.9.5.13 Cheese (Also see chapter 4.4.5.1.2.) Eleven cohort studies and 25 case-control studies investi- gated cheese. Most cohort studies showed increased risk withincreased intake. Meta-analysis showed a non-significant increased risk. The potential mechanisms for the association of cheese with cancers of the colon and rectum are unclear. Saturated fatty acids can induce expression of inflammatory mediatorsand stimulate increased insulin production. The evidence is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that cheese is a cause of colorectal cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies185-188and one case-control study189have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.9.5.14 Foods containing animal fats (Also see chapter 4.5.5.2.) Five cohort studies investigated animal fats. Most studies showed increased risk with increased intake but there is potential for residual confounding. Meta-analysis of cohortdata showed a non-significant increased risk. Diets high in fat lead to increased levels of bile acids in the colon. Bile acids are metabolised by the bacterial florato deo xycholic acid, which can promote cancer in rodents. The conversion of bile acids to secondar ybile acids such as deoxycholic acid is decreased by the lower pH induced by short-chain fatty acids pr oduced in diets high in non-star ch polysaccharides. Also, deoxycholic acid is less soluble at a lower pH, which may limit its adverse effects. 190 There is a limited amount of fairly consistent evidence suggesting that consumption of foods containinganimal fats is a cause of colorectal cancer. The P anel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study167has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see bo x3.8. 7.9.5.15 Foods containing sugars (Also see chapter 4.6.5.1.) Atotal of one cohort study and seven case-control studies investigated sugars as foods. Seven cohort studies and 16case-contr ol studies investigated sugars as nutrients, defined as total sugar, sucrose, or fructose. Most studies showed increased risk with increased total sugars, sucrose, or fruc-tose intak e. Data wer eparticularly suggestive for fructose. In most, though not all, animal experiments, sucrose and fructose are associated with increased colonic proliferationand foci, which are precursors of colon can- cers (see chapter 2). The evidence is sparse and inconsistent. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting that foods containing sugars are a cause of colorectal cancer. 7.9.5.16 Alcoholic drinks (Also see chapter 4.8.5.1.) Twenty-four cohort studies investigated alcoholic drinks; 13 cohort studies and 41 case-control studies investigatedethanol intake. Nearly all cohort studies showed increased risk with increased intake, with none reporting statistically significant contrary results. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 9 per cent increased risk per 10 g ethanol/day (fig- ure 4.8.10). A pooled analysis of more than 4600 colorectalcancer cases among more than 475 000 participants, fol- lowed up for 6-16 years, showed a 41 per cent increased risk for the groups that drank the most alcohol. 191There was some suggestion of sexual dimorphism, with a possibly greater effect in men than in women. This more elevated riskmay be because of the generally higher consumption of alco-hol among men. Also, men and women may prefer differenttypes of alcoholic drinks, there may be hormone-related dif- ferences in alcohol metabolism, or susceptibility to alcohol may exist. Data also suggested a 'J'-shaped dose-responserelationship, with low intak ebeing associated with lower risk compared with no intake. Because of the abundant pr ospective data fr om cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. Reactive metabolites of alcohol such as acetaldehyde can be carcinogenic. There is also an interaction with smoking.Tobacco may induce specific mutations in DNA that are lessefficiently repaired in the presence of alcohol. Alcohol mayalso function as a solvent, enhancing penetration of othercarcinogenic molecules into mucosal cells. Additionally ,the effects of alcohol may be mediated through the production of prostaglandins, lipid per oxidation ,and the generation of free radical oxygen species. Lastly, high consumers of alco- hol may have diets low in essential nutrients, making tissuessusceptible to car cinogenesis. There is ample and generally consistent evidence from cohort studies. A dose-response relationship isapparent. There is evidence for plausible mechanisms.The evidence that consumption of mor ethan about 30 g per day of ethanol fr om alcoholic drinks is a cause of color ectal cancer in men is convincing; and it is probably a cause in women. The P anel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, four cohort studies159 192-194and four case-control studies154 195-197 have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see bo x3.8. 7.9.5.17 Calcium (Also see chapter 4.10.6.4.4.) Seven cohort studies investigated calcium supplements. All but one reported decreased risk with calcium supplementa-tion. A pooled analysis of 10 cohort studies (nearly 5000 col- orectal cancer cases among more than 530 000 participants, followed up for 6-16 years) showed a 22 per cent decr eased risk for the gr oups with the highest calcium intak es (dietar y and supplemental sources). 183In addition, two randomised controlled trials and four cohort studies investigated calci-um supplements and the risk of adenomas. Both trials and 287CHAPTER 7 CANCERS most of the cohort studies showed decreased risk with supplementation. Because of the abundant prospective data from cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. Calcium from diet is an important nutrient; intracellular calcium is a pervasive second messenger acting on many cel- lular functions including cell growth. Calcium has direct growth-restraining and differentiation- and apoptosis-induc- ing actions on normal and tumour colorectal cells.184 There is generally consistent evidence from several cohort studies, and evidence from trials for colorectal adenomas. There is evidence for plausiblemechanisms. Calcium probably protects againstcolorectal cancer. 7.9.5.18 Selenium (Also see chapter 4.10.6.4.5.) One randomised controlled trial and one cohort study inves-tigated selenium supplements. The trial showed a statistically significant decreased risk with a daily supplement of 200 gof selenium. This was a r elatively small study (1321 partici - pants; 8 cases in the supplement group and 19 in the control group) and colorectal cancer was a secondary outcome. Thecohort study showed non-significant decreased risk. Dietary selenium deficiency has been shown to cause a lack of selenoprotein expression. Twenty-five selenoproteinshave been identified in animals of anti-inflammator yand antio damage to biomolecules such as lipids, lipopr o- teins, and DNA. Three are thioredoxin reductases and, among other functions, these regenerate oxidised ascorbicacid to its active antio xidant form. The evidence is sparse. There is limited evidence to suggest that selenium protects against colorectalcancer. 7.9.5.19 Physical activity (Also see chapter 5.4.1.) Eleven cohort studies investigated total physical activity; 12 cohort studies investigated occupational physical activity;and 24 cohort studies investigated r ecreational activity. Most studies reported an association between increased physical activity and decr eased cancer risk. Most studies wer eunsuit- able for meta-analysis due to the disparate measur es used to assess physical activity. The data also suggested that the effect was reduced or removed for rectal cancer. The evi-dence, overall, was br oad and consistent. A published meta- analysis of 19 cohort studies reported a statistically significant decreased risk for physical activity for colon can-cer, but not for rectal cancer. Sustained moderate physical activity raises the metabolic rate and incr eases maximal oxygen uptake. In the long term, regular periods of such activity incr ease the body 's metabolic efficiency and capacity (the amount of work that it can per- form), as well as reducing blood pressure and insulin resis-tance. In addition ,physical activity incr eases gut motility .There is abundant epidemiological evidence from prospective studies showing lower risk of colorectalcancer with higher overall levels of physical activity, aswell as with greater frequency and intensity, and thereis evidence of a dose-response effect. There is littleheterogeneity, except that the effect is not as clear forrectal cancer as it is for colon cancer. There is plausible evidence for mechanisms operating in humans. Theevidence that higher levels of physical activity, withinthe range studied, protect against colon cancer isconvincing. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, four cohort198-201and four case-control studies154 202-204have been published. This new information does not change the Paneljudgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.9.5.20 Body fatness (Also see chapter 6.1.3.1.) Sixty cohort studies and 86 case-contr ol studies investigat - ed body fatness, as measured by BMI. Most of the cohort studies showed incr eased risk with incr eased body fatness. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 15 per cent increased risk per 5 kg/m2(figure 6.1.6). Heterogeneity is explained partially by sexual and geographical differences, and also bycancer site. When stratified according to cancer site, data aremore consistent and suggest a larger increased risk for coloncancer (figur e6.1.7) than for rectal cancer (figure 6.1.8). Because of the abundant pr ospective data fr om cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. Body fatness dir ectly affects levels of many cir culating hor - mones, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and oestrogens, creating an environment that encourages car-cinogenesis and discourages apoptosis. It also stimulates thebody's inflammatory response, which may contribute to theinitiation and progression of several cancers. Also see chap-ter 6.1.3 and box 2.4. Thereis abundant and consistent epidemiological evidence with a clear dose-r esponse r elationship, and evidence for plausible mechanisms that operate in humans. The evidence that greater body fatness is acause of colorectal cancer is convincing. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, 15 cohort58 59 151 205-215and 2 case-contr ol studies216-218have been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.9.5.21 Abdominal fatness (Also see chapter 6.1.3.2.) Seven cohort studies and two case-control studies investi-gated waist circumference; six cohort studies and four case- control studies investigated waist to hip ratio. All cohort studies showed incr eased risk with either increased waist cir- cumfer ence or incr eased waist to hip ratio .Meta-analysis was possible on four cohort studies measuring waist circumfer- ence and five cohort studies measuring waist to hip ratio.This showed a 5 per cent incr eased risk per inch of waist cir - 288PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS cumference, or a 30 per cent increased risk per 0.1 increment of waist to hip ratio (figures 6.1.22 and 6.1.23). The general mechanisms through which abdominal fatness could plausibly influence cancer risk are outlined in chapter6.1.3 (for more detail see box 2.4). The hormonal and other biological effects of being overweight or obese are outlined inchapter 8. Many of these, such as increased circulating oestrogens and decreased insulin sensitivity, are associated with abdominal fatness independently of overall bodyfatness. There is ample consistent epidemiological evidence with a clear dose-response relationship and robustevidence for mechanisms that operate in humans. Theevidence that abdominal fatness is a cause ofcolorectal cancer is convincing. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, three cohort studies146 205 209have been published. This new infor- mation does not change the P anel judgement. Also see bo x3.8. 7.9.5.22 Adult attained height (Also see chapter 6.2.3.1.) Twenty-one cohort studies and 16 case-control studies investigated adult attained height. Most cohort studiesshowed increased risk with increased height. Meta-analysisof cohort data showed a 9 per cent increased risk per 5 cmof height (figur e6.2.1). Because of the abundant pr ospective data fr om cohort studies, case-control studies were not summarised. The general mechanisms thr ough which the factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences, could plausibly influence cancer risk are outlined in chapter6.2.1.3 (for mor edetail see bo x2.4). Many of these, such as early-life nutrition, altered hormone profiles, and the rate of sexual maturation, could plausibly increase cancer risk. There is ample prospective epidemiological evidence, which is consistent, and ther eis a clear dose-response relationship, with evidence for plausible mechanisms operating in humans. The evidence that the factorsthat lead to greater adult attained height, or itsconsequences, are a cause of colorectal cancer isconvincing. The causal factor is unlik ely to be tallness itself, but factors that promote linear growth in childhood. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, four cohort studies146 151 206 207 209have been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see bo x 3.8. 7.9.5.23 Other exposures Other exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either of too low quality ,too inconsistent, or the number of studies too few to allow conclusions to be r eached. These were as follows: cereals (grains) or their products; potatoes; poultry; shellfish and seafood; with previous report 7.9.6.1 General See 7.1.6.1, and box 3.8 in chapter 3. 7.9.6.2 Specific The previous report judged the evidence that vegetables pro- tect against colorectal cancer to be convincing. The resultsof cohort studies since then have generally not been sup-portive of this judgement. Evidence that red meat and, in particular, processed meat are causes of colorectal cancer is now stronger. The pr evious r eport noted the evidence showing that greater adult height was a possible cause of colorectal can- cer.The evidence now is str onger ,as is that for body fatness and for abdominal fatness. The previous report found that frequent meals or snacks possibly increased the risk of col-orectal cancer; this was not found here. The evidence that dietary fibre protects against colorectal cancer is here judged to be stronger than it was previously.Evidence that garlic, milk, and calcium supplements ar e probably pr otective was not found previously. 7.9.7 Conclusions The P anel concludes : The evidence that physical activity protects against colorec-tal cancer is convincing, although the evidence is strongerfor colon than for rectum. The evidence that red meat, processed meat, substantial consumption (mor ethan about 30 g per day ethanol) of alco- holic drinks (by men ,and pr obably by women), body fatness and abdominal fatness, and the factors that lead to gr eater adult attained height, or its consequences, are causes of col- orectal cancer is convincing. Foods containing dietary fibre, as well as garlic, milk, and calcium, probably protect against this cancer. Thereis limited evidence suggesting that non-star chy veg- etables, fruits, foods containing folate, as well as fish, foodscontaining vitamin D, and also selenium and foods contain- ing it, protect against colorectal cancer, and that foods con-taining ir on,and also cheese, foods containing animal fats, and foods containing sugars are causes of this cancer. 289CHAPTER 7 CANCERS Cancer of the breast is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Ar ound 1.15 million cases wer erecorded in 2002, accounting for around 23 per cent of all cancers in women (11 per cent overall). Observed rates of this cancer increase with industrialisation and urbanisation, and also with facilitiesfor early detection. It r emains much more common in high-income countries but is now incr easing rapidly in middle- and low-income countries, including within Africa, much of Asia, and Latin America. Breast cancer is fatal inunder half of all cases and is the leading cause of deathfrom cancer in women (fifth overall), accounting for 14 per cent of all cancer deaths worldwide. Breast cancer is hormone related, and the factors that modify the risk of this cancer when diagnosed premenopausally and when diagnosed (much morecommonly) postmenopausally are not the same. Overall, the P anel is impressed by the pattern of evidence showing the importance of early life events,including food and nutrition, as well as factors that affecthormone status, in modification of the risk of breastcancer . FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE BREAST (PREMENOPAUSE) Inthe judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the breast (premenopause).

Physical activity probably protects against breast cancer postmenopause, and there is limited evidence suggestingthat it protects against this cancer diagnosedpremenopause. The evidence that alcoholic drinks are a cause of breast cancer at all ages is convincing. Theevidence that the factors that lead to greater adultattained height, or its consequences, are a cause ofpostmenopausal breast cancer is convincing, and these are probably also a cause of breast cancer diagnosed premenopause. The factors that lead to greater birth weight, or its consequences, are probably a cause of breast cancerdiagnosed premenopause. Adult weight gain is probably acause of postmenopausal breast cancer. The evidence that body fatness is a cause of postmenopausal breast cancer is convincing, and abdominal body fatness is probably also acause. On the other hand, body fatness pr obably pr otects against breast cancer diagnosed premenopause. There is limited evidence suggesting that total dietary fat is a causeof postmenopausal breast cancer. Life events that protect against breast cancer include late menarche, early pregnancy, bearing children, andearly menopause, all of which have the effect of reducingthe number of menstrual cycles, and therefore lifetimeexposur eto oestrogen. The reverse also applies. See chapter 8 for evidence and judgements on factors that modify the risk of body fatness and abdominalfatness, including physical activity and sedentary ways oflife, the energy density of foods and drinks, andbreastfeeding. In final summary ,the str ongest evidence, corr esponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\", shows that lactation protects against breast cancer; that alcoholicdrinks are a cause of this cancer; that the factors that leadto greater adult attained height, or its consequences, are acause of postmenopausal and pr obably also premenopausal br east cancer; that factors that lead to greater birth weight, or its consequences, ar eprobably a cause of premenopausal breast cancer; and that abdominal body fatness and adult weight gain areprobably a cause of postmenopausal breast cancer. Body fatness is a cause of postmenopausal breast cancer but probably pr otects against premenopausal breast cancer. Breast tissue comprises mainly fat, glandular tissue (arranged in lobes), ducts, and connective tissue. Br east tissue develops in response to hormones such as oestrogens, progesterone, insulin, and growth factors. The main periods of developmentare during puberty, pregnancy, and lactation. The glandular tis- sue atrophies after menopause. Breast cancers are almost all carcinomas of the epithelial cells lining the ducts (the channels in the br east that carr ymilk to the nipple). 219Premenopausal and postmenopausal breast can- cers are considered separately in this Report. Although rare,breast cancer can occur in men ,but it is not included her e.7.10.1 Trends, incidence, and survival Age-adjusted rates of breast cancer in women are increasing in most countries, particularly in areas where the incidencehad previously been low, such as Japan, China, and south- ern and eastern Europe. 124 137 This is predominantly a disease of high-income countries, where overall rates are nearly three times higher than in mid- dle- to low-income countries. Around the world, age-adjust-ed incidence rates range from 75-100 per 100 000 women inNorth America, northern Europe, and Australia, to less than 20 per 100 000 in parts of Africa and Asia. 2In the USA, rates are higher among white women than those from other eth- nic groups, although mortality is highest in black women.3 Overall risk doubles each decade until the menopause, when the increase slows down or remains stable. However,breast cancer is more common after the menopause. Studies of women who migrate from areas of low risk to areas of high risk show that rates of breast cancer in migrants assume therate in the host countr ywithin one or two generations. This shows that environmental factors are important in the pro- gression of the disease. 220 Breast cancers can often be detected at a relatively early stage. In countries that provide or advocate screening, mostof these cancers are diagnosed when the disease is still at alocalised stage. 221Survival rates range from more than 90 to less than 50 per cent, depending on the characteristics of thetumour ,its size and spread, and the availability of treatment. 4 Average 5-year sur vival rates are higher in high-income coun- tries: around 73 per cent, compared with 57 per cent in mid- dle- to low-income countries. Br east cancer accounts for nearly 23 per cent of all cancer incidence in women and 14 per cent of all cancer deaths (all sites except for skin (non-melanoma) and in women only). Also see bo x7.1.1. 7.10.2 Pathogenesis Breast tissue, as well as hormones and hormone-receptor sta- tus, varies at differ ent stages of life. It is ther efore possible that individual risk factors will have differ ent effects at dif - ferent life stages (see 7.10.5). Early menarche, late menopause, not bearing children, and late (over 30) firstpregnancy all increase breast cancer risk. 220 222The age when breasts develop, and menopause, are both influenced by nutrition ,with overnutrition leading to early puberty and late menopause; undernutrition delays puberty and advancesmenopause (see chapter 6.2). Hormones play an important role in breast cancer pro- gression because they modulate the structur eand gr owth of epithelial tumour cells. 4Different cancers vary in hormone sensitivity. Many breast cancers also produce hormones, suchas growth factors, that act locally, and these can both stim- ulate and inhibit the tumour's growth. 223 224 Between 4 and 9 per cent of br east cancer cases are hered- itary,and ar eusually caused by inherited mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.225 226In addition, growth factor receptor genes, as well as some oncogenes, are overexpressedin many br east cancers 4(see bo x2.2). 291CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.10.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) Life events .As stated above, lifetime exposure to oestrogen, influenced by early menarche, late natural menopause, not bearing children, and late (over 30) first pregnancy all increase the risk of, and may be seen as causes of, breast can- cer.220 222The reverse also applies: late menarche, early menopause, bearing children, and early pregnancy all reduce therisk of, and may be seen as protective against, breast can- cer. Age of breast development and menopause are influ- enced by nutrition, with high-energy diets promoting earlier puberty and late menopause, and low-energy dietsdelaying puberty and advancing menopause. Radiation .Ionising radiation exposure from medical treat- ment such as X-rays, particularly during puberty, increases risk, even at low doses.227 Medication .Hormone replacement therapy is a cause of breast cancer .The incr eased risk appears to disappear a few years after cessation.144Oral contraceptives containing both oestrogen and progesterone cause a small, transient,increased risk of breast cancer; the increased risk disappearsafter cessation. 133 7.10.4 Interpr etation of the evidence 7.10.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2,3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio sures of to br east cancer include: Patterns .The preponderance of data from high-income countries is a special issue with breast cancer. Breast canceris hormone r elated, and factors that modify risk have dif- ferent effects on cancers diagnosed pre- and postmenopause. Classification .Because of the importance of menopause as aneffect modifier, studies should stratify for menopause sta- tus. Many do not. Confounding .Hormone replacement therapy is an important possible confounder in postmenopausal breast cancer. A fewstudies also reported results separately for different hormone receptor profiles within cancers. High-quality studies adjust for age, number of r eproductive cycles, age at which children wereborn,and the taking of hormone-based medications.7.10.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 873 publications were included in the SLR for breast cancer. Fuller summaries of the epidemiological, experi-mental, and mechanistic evidence are to be found in Chapters 4-6. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.10.5.1 Alcoholic drinks (Also see chapter 4.8.5.1.) Atotal of 11 cohort studies, 31 case-control studies, and 2 ecological studies investigated alcoholic drinks; 25 cohort studies, 29 case-control studies, and 4 ecological studiesinvestigated ethanol intake and all-age breast cancer.Further studies investigated the relationship with alcoholicdrinks in either pre- or postmenopausal breast cancer. Most studies showed increased risk with increased intake. Meta- analysis of cohort data showed a 10 per cent increased riskper 10 g ethanol/day ;meta-analysis of case-contr ol data showed a 5 per cent increased risk per 5 drinks/week, and a6per cent incr eased risk per 10 g ethanol/day (figur es 4.8.13, 4.8.15, and 4.8.16). Menopausal status did not sig- nificantly alter the association. Two pooled analyses alsoshowed statistically significant increased risks of 9 and 7 percent per 10 g ethanol/day. The first was based on 6 cohortstudies with more than 320 000 participants, followed upfor up to 11 years, with mor ethan 4300 breast cancer cases. The other analysed 53 case-contr ol studies, with mor ethan 58 000 cases and more than 95 000 controls. 228 229 Reactive metabolites of alcohol, such as acetaldehyde, may be carcinogenic. Additionally, the effects of alcohol may be mediated through the production of prostaglandins, lipidperoxidation ,and the generation of fr ee radical o xygen species. Alcohol also acts as a solvent, enhancing penetra- tion of carcinogens into cells. High consumers of alcoholmay have diets deficient in essential nutrients, making tis-sues susceptible to carcinogenesis. In addition, most exper-imental studies in animals have shown that alcohol intak e is associated with incr eased br east cancer risk. Alcohol inter- feres with oestr ogen metabolism and action in multiple ways, influencing hormone levels and oestrogen receptors. There is an interaction between folate and alcohol affect- ing br east cancer risk: increased folate status partially mit- igates the risk from increased alcohol consumption. 230 Thereis ample, generally consistent evidence fr om case-control and cohort studies. A dose-response relationship is apparent. There is robust evidence for mechanisms operating in humans. The evidence that alcoholic drinks are a cause of premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer is convincing. No threshold was identified. The P anel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-contr ol study231has been published. This new informa - tion does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 292PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 7.10.5.2 Lactation (Also see chapter 6.3.3.) One cohort study and 37 case-control studies investigated ever having breastfed as compared to never having breast-fed; and 5 cohort studies and 55 case-control studies inves- tigated the total duration of lactation. The single cohort study and most case-control studies showed decreased risk (age unspecified) with ever having breastfed compared with never. Most studies showed decreased risk with increasingduration of breastfeeding. Meta-analysis of case-control data showed a 3 per cent decreased risk per 5 months of total breastfeeding (figure 6.3.1); meta-analysis of cohort data showed a non-significant decreased risk. Pooled analysis from 47 epidemiological studies in 30 countries (more than50 000 controls and nearly 97 000 breast cancer cases)showed a statistically significant decreased risk of breast can-cer of 4.3 per cent for each 12 months of breastfeeding. Menopause status was not an effect modifier. 228 386 Lactation is associated with increased differentiation of breast cells and with lower exposur eto endogenous sex hor - mones In addi- tion,the of br east tissue during lactation , and the massive epithelial apoptosis at the end of lactation, could decrease risk by elimination of cells with potentialDNA damage. There is abundant epidemiological evidence from both prospective and case-control studies, which is consistent and shows a dose-r esponse r elationship. There is robust evidence for plausible mechanisms that operate in humans. The evidence that lactationprotects against both premenopausal andpostmenopausal breast cancer is convincing. 7.10.5.3 Physical activity (Also see chapter 5.4.2.) Six cohort studies and 8 case-control studies investigatedtotal physical activity; 5 cohort studies and 7 case-controlstudies investigated occupational activity ;and 14 cohort studies and 11 case-contr ol studies investigated r ecreation- al activity . Menopause age unspecified Most studies showed decr eased risk with increased physical activity. Meta-analysis of case-control data showed a 10 per cent decr eased risk per 7 MET -hours recreational activi- ty/week (figur e5.4.5). Premenopause Data wer einconsistent for most categories, but data on occu - pational activity were suggestive of decreased risk. Postmenopause Nearly all of the cohort studies and most case-control stud- ies showed decr eased risk with increased physical activity. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 3 per cent decr eased risk per 7 MET-hours recreational activity/week (figure 5.4.6). Sustained moderate physical activity raises the metabolic rate and incr eases maximal o xygen uptak e. In the long term,regular periods of such activity increase the body's metabolic efficiency and capacity (the amount of work that it can per- form), as well as reducing blood pressure and insulin resis- tance. In addition, it decreases levels of oestrogens andandrogens in postmenopausal women. Some trials have also shown decreases in circulating oestrogens, increased men- strual cycle length, and decreased ovulation in pre- menopausal women with a high level of physical activity. Premenopause: There is ample evidence from prospective studies, but it is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that physical activity protects against premenopausal breast cancer. Postmenopause: There is ample evidence from prospective studies showing lower risk ofpostmenopausal breast cancer with higher levels of physical activity, with a dose-response relationship, although there is some heterogeneity. There is littleevidence on fr equency ,duration, or intensity of activity . There is robust evidence for mechanisms operating in humans. Physical activity pr obably pr otects against postmenopausal breast cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-control study232has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.10.5.4 Body fatness (Also see chapter 6.1.3.1.) Forty-thr ee cohort studies, mor ethan 100 case-contr ol stud- ies, and 2 ecological studies investigated body fatness, as measured by BMI. When grouped for all ages, data wereinconsistent. However ,aconsistent effect emer ged when they were stratified according to menopausal status. Most studies showed a decreased risk for premenopausal breastcancer and an increased risk for postmenopausal breast can-cer with increased body fatness. For cancer diagnosed pre-menopause, meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 15 percent decr eased risk per 5 kg/m 2;meta-analysis of case-con - trol data showed a 15 per cent incr eased risk per 5 kg/m2. For cancer diagnosed postmenopause, meta-analysis of cohort data showed an 8 per cent increased risk per 5 kg/m2; meta-analysis of case-contr ol data showed a 13 per cent increased risk per 5 kg/m2(figures 6.1.11-6.1.16). Two pooled analyses showed statistically significant increased risk for postmenopausal cancer .One of these also showed a statistically significant decreased risk for pre- menopausal breast cancer. One pooled analysis was basedon 7 cohort studies with mor ethan 33 7000 participants, fol - lowed up for up to 11 years, with more than 4300 breast can- cer cases. It showed a 14 per cent decreased risk per 5 kg/m 2 for cancer diagnosed premenopause and a 9 per cent increased risk per 5 kg/m2for cancer diagnosed post- menopause. The other pooled analysis, based on 53 case-contr ol studies with mor ethan 5 8000 cases and mor ethan 95 000 controls, showed a 19 per cent increased risk per 5 kg/m 2for postmenopausal breast cancer.233 234 Body fatness dir levels of many cir culating hor - 293CHAPTER 7 CANCERS mones, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and oestrogens, creating an environment that encourages car- cinogenesis and discourages apoptosis (see box 2.4). It also stimulates the body's inflammatory response, which maycontribute to the initiation and progression of several can- cers (see chapter 2.4.1.3). Adjusting for serum levels of oestradiol diminishes or destroys the association with BMI, suggesting that hormones are a predominant mechanism. 235 There is no single well established mechanism through which body fatness could prevent premenopausal breast can- cer. According to the oestrogen plus progesterone theory, overweight premenopausal women would be protected because they would be more frequently anovulatory, and therefore less exposed to endogenous progesterone.However, this theory is not well supported by recent stud-ies, which suggest that natural progesterone could be pro-tective. 236Normal levels of natural progesterone are likely to be protective, and well nourished, or perhaps overnourished women, who may become slightly overweight in adulthood,may be pr otected by their natural fertile condition .Another possible mechanism is that the increased adipose tissue- derived oestr ogen levels in over weight childr en could induce early breast differentiation and eliminate some tar- gets for malignant transformation. 237Anovulation and abnormal hormone profiles are commonly associated withobesity. 238The age-specific pattern of association of breast cancer with BMI, therefore, is largely explained by its rela-tionship with endogenous sex hormone levels. Breast cancer diagnosed postmenopause is much mor e common. Therefore, throughout life, a decreased risk of pre- menopausal br east cancer would be expected to be out - weighed by an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Premenopause: There is a substantial amount of consistent epidemiological evidence with a dose-response relationship, but the mechanistic evidence isspeculative. Greater body fatness probably protectsagainst pr emenopausal breast cancer. Postmenopause: Ther eis abundant and consistent epidemiological evidence and a clear dose-response relationship with robust evidence for mechanismsoperating in humans. The evidence that gr eater body fatness is a cause of postmenopausal breast cancer is convincing. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort239and one case-control study240have been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.10.5.5 Adult attained height (Also see chapter 6.2.3.1.) Thirty-thr ee cohort studies, 56 case-control studies, and 3 ecological studies investigated adult attained height. Age unspecified Twenty cohort studies and 29 case-contr ol studies investi -gated adult attained height and breast cancer at all ages, or unspecified menopausal status. Most of the studies showed increased risk. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 9 per cent increased risk per 5 cm of height; meta-analysis of case-control data showed a 3 per cent increased risk per 5 cm of height (figure 6.2.2). Premenopause Seventeen cohort studies and 38 case-control studies inves- tigated adult attained height and premenopausal breast can- cer. Most of the studies showed increased risk. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 9 per cent increased risk per 5 cm of height; meta-analysis of case-control data showed a 4 per cent increased risk per 5 cm of height (figure 6.2.4). Apooled analysis of 7 cohort studies (more than 337 000 par-ticipants, followed up for up to 11 years, with more than4300 breast cancer cases) showed a non-significant increased risk with greater adult attained height. 234 Therearefewer data for pr emenopausal than for postmenopausal breast cancer. The epidemiological evidence is generally consistent, with a dose-r esponse relationship and evidence for plausible mechanisms.The factors that lead to greater adult attained height,or its consequences, are probably a cause ofpremenopausal breast cancer. The causal factor isunlikely to be tallness itself, but factors that promotelinear gr owth in childhood. Postmenopause Twenty-two cohort studies and 34 case-contr ol studies inves - tigated adult attained height and postmenopausal breast cancer. Nearly all of the cohort studies and most of the case-contr ol studies showed incr eased risk, with no studies show - ing statistically significant contrary results. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed an 11 per cent increased risk per 5 cmof height; meta-analysis of case-control data showed a 2 percent increased risk per 5 cm of height (figure 6.2.3). Apooled analysis of 7 cohort studies (mor ethan 337 000 par- ticipants, followed up for up to 11 years, with mor ethan 4300 br east cancer cases) showed a statistically significant 7per cent increased risk per 5 cm of height. 234The ecolog- ical studies provided supporting data. The general mechanisms thr ough which the factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences, could plausibly influence cancer risk ar eoutlined in chapter 6.2.1.3 (for mor edetail see bo x2.4). Many of these, such asearly-life nutrition, altered hormone profiles, and the rate of sexual maturation, could plausibly increase cancer risk. There is abundant prospective epidemiological evidence, which is generally consistent, with a clear dose-response relationship, and evidence for plausiblemechanisms operating in humans. The evidence thatthe factors that lead to gr eater adult attained height, or its consequences, ar eacause of postmenopausal breast cancer is convincing. The causal factor is unlikely to be tallness itself, but factors that promotelinear gr owth in childhood. 294PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study241has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.10.5.6 Abdominal fatness (postmenopause) (Also see chapter 6.1.3.2.) Eight cohort studies and three case-control studies investi- gated waist circumference and postmenopausal breast cancer; eight cohort studies and eight case-control studies investigated waist to hip ratio. All of the waist-cir- cumference studies and most of those on waist to hip ratio showed increased risk with increased measures of abdomi- nal fatness. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 19 per cent increased risk per 0.1 increment in waist to hip ratio(figure 6.1.24). The general mechanisms through which abdominal fatness could plausibly cause cancer are outlined in chapter 6.1.3 (for more detail see box 2.4). The hormonal and other biological effects of being overweight or obese are outlined in chapter8. Many of these, such as incr eased levels of cir culating oestrogens and decreased insulin sensitivity, are associated with abdominal fatness independently of overall body fatness. There is a substantial amount of epidemiological evidence but some inconsistency. There is robustevidence for mechanisms that operate in humans.Abdominal fatness is a probable cause ofpostmenopausal br east cancer. 7.10.5.7 Adult weight gain (postmenopause) (Also see chapter 6.1.3.3.) Seven cohort studies and 17 case-control studies investigat- ed adult weight gain and postmenopausal breast cancer.Nearly all of the studies showed incr eased risk with increased weight gain in adulthood. Meta-analysis of case- control data showed a 5 per cent increased risk per 5 kggained (figure 6.1.26). Heterogeneity may be explained byfailure to separate hor-mone r eplacement therapy. Body fatness affects levels culating such as insulin ,insulin-lik egrowth factors, and oestrogens, creating an environment that encourages car- cinogenesis and discourages apoptosis (see chapter 2.7.1.3).It also stimulates the body 's inflammatory response, which may contribute to the initiation and progression of several cancers. There is ample, consistent epidemiological evidence from both cohort and case-control studies. A dose- response r elationship was appar ent fr om case-control and cohort studies. Adult weight gain is a probable cause of postmenopausal breast cancer. 7.10.5.8 Greater birth weight (premenopause) (Also see chapter 6.2.3.2.) Six cohort studies and four case-contr ol studies investigat - ed birth weight. All cohort studies and most case-control studies showed increased risk with greater birth weight, withnone r eporting statistically significant contrar yresults.Meta-analysis of cohort data showed an 8 per cent increased risk per kg (figure 6.2.8). The general mechanisms through which the factors that lead to greater birth weight, or its consequences, couldplausibly influence cancer risk are outlined in chapter 6.2.1.1. Many of these, such as long-term programming of hormonal systems, could plausibly increase cancer risk. Greater birth weight raises circulating maternal oestrogen levels and may increase insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1activity; low birth weight raises both fetal and maternal lev- els of IGF-1 binding protein. The action of both oestrogens and IGF-1 are thought to be important in fetal growth and mammary gland development, and play a central, synergis- tic role in the initiation and promotion of breast cancer. 242 Animal experiments also provide evidence that exposure to oestrogens during fetal and early postnatal development canincrease the risk of mammary cancers. 243 There is general consistency amongst the relatively few epidemiological studies, with some evidence for adose-response relationship. The mechanistic evidenceis speculative. The factors that lead to gr eater birth weight, or its consequences, are probably a cause ofpremenopausal breast cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study239and one case-control study244have been pub- lished. This new information does not change the P anel judge- ment. Also see bo x3.8. 7.10.5.9 T otal fat (postmenopause) (Also see chapter 4.5.5.1.) Nine cohort studies and 16 case-control studies investigat-ed total fat intak eand postmenopausal br east cancer .Most studies showed increased risk with increased intake. Meta- analysis of cohort data showed a non-significant increasedrisk; meta-analysis of case-control data showed a statisticallysignificant increased risk. A pooled analysis (more than350 000 participants and more than 7300 breast cancer cases) showed an overall non-significant decr eased risk with increased fat intak e. Menopausal status did not significant- ly alter the result. 245 Higher endogenous oestrogen levels after menopause are aknown cause of br cancer.235 246Dietar yfat may om pr ospective epidemiological studies of different types on the whole shows inconsistent effects, while case-control studies show a significant positive association. Mechanistic evidence is speculative. Overall, there is limited evidence suggesting that consumption of total fat is a cause of postmenopausal breast cancer. 7.10.5.10 Other exposur es For premenopausal br east cancer ,other exposur es wer eeval- uated. However, the data were either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number of studies too few to allow con-clusions to be r eached. These wer eas follows: cer eals 295CHAPTER diets; glycaemic index; and being breastfed. For postmenopausal breast cancer other exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either of too low quali-ty, too inconsistent, or the number of studies too few to allow conclusions to be reached. These were as follows: cereals (grains) and their products; potatoes; index; being breastfed; and birth weight. There is considerable speculation around a biologically plausible interaction of soya and soya products with breastcancer development, due to their high phytoestr ogen con - tent. Data on pulses (legumes) were sparse and inconsistent, and there were insufficient studies available on soya con-sumption to allow a conclusion to be reached. 7.10.6 Comparison with pr evious r eport 7.10.6.1 General See 7.1.6.1, and box 3.8. 7.10.6.2 Specific One of the most striking differ ences between the two r eports is the finding her eon lactation .The pr evious r eport men - tioned studies indicating that breastfeeding may protect against breast cancer, but it did not review or judge thisevidence. Theprevious report found that high body mass probably increases the risk for breast cancer diagnosed after themenopause, while this Report found the evidence for body fatness to be convincing. While the previous report made no judgement on high body mass and pr emenopausal breast cancer ,this R eport found that gr eater body fatness pr obably decreases the risk. The previous report judged the evidence to be convincing that rapid growth, together with greateradult height, ar ecauses of br east cancer .This Report doesnot make a judgement on rates of growth. The previous report did not make judgments on birth weight. The previous report judged it probable that vegetables and fruits decrease breast cancer risk. Cohort findings since thenhave been equivocal. 7.10.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The evidence that lactation protects against breast cancer at all ages therafter is convincing. Physical activity probably protects against postmenopausal breast cancer, and there is limited evidence suggesting that it protects against pre-menopausal breast cancer. The evidence that alcoholic drinksare a cause of breast cancer at all ages is convincing. Theevidence that the factors that lead to greater attained adult height or its consequences are a cause of postmenopausal breast cancer is convincing; these are probably a cause ofpremenopausal br east cancer . The factors that lead to greater birth weight or its conse- quences ar eprobably a cause of br east cancer diagnosed pr e- menopause. Adult weight gain is probably a cause of postmenopausal breast cancer. The evidence that body fat-ness is a cause of postmenopausal breast cancer is convinc-ing, and abdominal body fatness is probably a cause of thiscancer. On the other hand, body fatness probably protectsagainst br east cancer diagnosed premenopause. There is lim- ited evidence suggesting that total dietar yfat is a cause of postmenopausal breast cancer. 296PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 7.11 Ovary Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women (and the 16th most common cancer overall)worldwide. Around 200 000 cases were recorded in 2002, accounting for around 4 per cent of all new cases ofcancer in women (2 per cent overall). It is most frequentin high-income countries. This cancer is usually fatal, andisthe seventh most common cause of cancer death in women worldwide (15th overall). The Panel judges as follows: The factors that lead to greater adult attained height, orits consequences, are probably a cause of cancer of theovary. There is limited evidence suggesting that non- starchy vegetables, and also lactation, protect against this cancer. Life events that pr otect against ovarian cancer include late menarche, bearing children, and early menopause, allof which have the effect of r educing the number of menstrual cycles, and therefore lifetime exposure tooestrogen. In final summary, the strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\", shows thatthe factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or itsconsequences, ar eprobably a cause of cancer of the ovary. The ovaries ar ethe sites of egg pr oduction in women .They are also the main source of the hormones oestrogen and prog- esterone. Therearethree types of ovarian tissue that can pr oduce cancers: epithelial cells, which cover the ovary; stromal cells, which produce hormones; and germ cells, which becomeeggs. Many different types of ovarian cancers can occur.About 85-90 per cent of ovarian cancers are carcinomas, 4the type included her e. 7.11.1 Trends, incidence, and survival Thereis no clear global trend in ovarian cancer incidence. Rates appear to be high in high-income countries, and ris- ing in countries under going economic transition .137For instance in Japan ,therewas a fourfold incr ease in the age- adjusted mortality rate (from 0.9 to 3.6 per 100 000 women) between 1950 and 1997.248 Ovarian cancer rates ar enearly thr ee times higher in high- than in middle- to low-income countries. Around the world, age-adjusted incidence rates range from more than 10 per100 000 women in Europe and North America, to less than 5per 100 000 in parts of Africa and Asia. But rates are rel- atively high elsewher ein Asia, for example in Singapore and the Philippines. 2In the US A,rates ar ehigher among white women than in those from other ethnic groups; rates are also higher in Jewish women of Ashkenazi descent.3249 Risk incr eases with age, although the rate of incr ease slowsafter the menopause, with most ovarian cancers occurring after menopause. Only 10-15 per cent of cases occur beforethe menopause, although germ cell cancers peak in women aged between 15 and 35. 4 Ovarian cancer often has no symptoms at the early stages, so the disease is generally advanced when it is diagnosed. The 5-year survival rate ranges from approximately 30 to 50 per cent.36This cancer accounts for about 7 per cent of all cancer incidence and 4 per cent of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Also see box 7.1.1. 7.11.2 Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of this disease is not well characterised, although various mechanisms have been suggested. Over many cycles of ovulation, the ovarian surface epitheliumunder goes r epeated disruption and r epair. The epithelial cells FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE OVARY Inthe judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the ovary. Judgements are graded according to the strength ofthe evidence. DECREASES RISK INCREASES RISK Convincing Probable Adult attained height1 Limited \u2014 Non-starchy fatness; abdominal fatness; weight change; energy intake Substantial effect on risk None identified unlikely 1 Adult attained height is unlikely directly to modify the risk of cancer. It is a marker for genetic, envir onmental, hor monal, and also nutritional factors affecting growth during the period from preconception to completion of linear gr owth (see chapter 6.2.1.3). 2Judgements on vegetables and fr uits do not include those preserved by salting and/or pickling. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. 297CHAPTER 7 CANCERS are stimulated to proliferate, which increases the probabili- ty of spontaneous mutations. Alternatively, following ovula- tion, these cells may become trapped within the connective tissue surrounding the ovary, which can lead to the forma-tion of inclusion cysts. If this happens, the epithelial cells are subjected to a unique pro-inflammatory microenvironment, which may increase the rate of DNA damage. Most ovarian cancers occur spontaneously, although 5-10 per cent of cases develop due to a genetic predisposition. 104 The latter, involving dysfunctional BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes chapter 2.4.1.1), produces high-grade carcinomas, with apoorer prognosis.250 7.11.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) Life events .The risk of ovarian cancer is affected by the num- ber of menstrual cycles during a woman 's lifetime. Not bear - ing children increases the risk of, and may be seen as a cause of,ovarian cancer .The r everse also applies: bearing childr en reduces the risk of, and may be seen as protective against, ovarian cancer.251-253There is also substantial evidence that, as with breast cancer, early menarche and late naturalmenopause increase the risk of, and may be seen as causesof, ovarian cancer. The reverse also applies: late menarcheand early menopause r educe the risk of, and may be seen as protective against, ovarian cancer . 251-253 Medication .Oral contraceptives pr otect against this cancer .133 7.11.4 Interpr etation of the evidence 7.11.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2,3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this R eport to denote sures to cancer of the ovary include: Patter ns.Because ovarian cancer is hormone r elated, factors that modify risk might have different effects at different times of life. If so, this might partly explain heterogeneousresults. Confounding .High-quality studies adjust for age, number of reproductive cycles, age at which children were born, and the taking of hormone-based medications. Classification .Therearediffer ent histological subtypes of ovarian cancer, which may have independent risk factors and disease progression patterns. Most studies combine thesesubtypes.7.11.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 187 publications were included in the SLR for ovar- ian cancer. Fuller summaries of the epidemiological, exper-imental, and mechanistic evidence are to be found in Chapters 4-6. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.11.5.1 Non-starchy vegetables (Also see chapter 4.2.5.1.) Atotal of five cohort studies, eight case-control studies, and two ecological studies investigated non-starchy vegetables; three cohort studies and two case-control studies investi-gated green, leafy vegetables. All showed decreased risk withincreased intake, with none reporting contrary results. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a statistically significant decreased risk for non-starchy vegetables, with a clear dose- response relationship. A pooled analysis of 12 cohort stud-ies (mor ethan 56 0000 participants, followed up for 7-22 years, with more than 2100 ovarian cancer cases) showed a non-significant decr eased risk for the highest intak egroup of non-starchy vegetables. 254 This is a wide and disparate category, and many different plant food constituents are represented that could contributeto a protective effect of are potentially antioxidants. Antio xidants trap ee radicals xygen mole- cules, protecting against oxidation damage. It is difficult to unravel the relative importance of each constituent and it islikely that any pr otective effect may r esult fr om a combina - tion of influences on several pathways involved in carcinogenesis. Evidence from cohort and case-control studies is sparse. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting that non- starchy vegetables pr otect against ovarian cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-control study17has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.11.5.2 Adult attained height (Also see chapter 6.2.3.1.) Seven cohort studies, nine case-control studies, and two eco- logical studies investigated adult attained height. All cohortstudies and most other studies showed incr eased risk with greater adult attained height. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed an 8 per cent increased risk per 5 cm of height (fig-ure 6.2.7); meta-analysis of case-control data showed no sta- tistically significant relationship. Heterogeneity in the latter was derived almost entir ely from one study. The general mechanisms thr ough which the factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences, could plausibly influence cancer risk are outlined in chapter6.2.1.3 (see bo x2.4). Many of these, such as early-life 298PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS nutrition, altered hormone profiles, and the rate of sexual maturation, could plausibly increase cancer risk. There is some inconsistency, but the better quality epidemiological data show a clearer effect, with adose-response relationship. There is evidence forplausible mechanisms operating in humans. The factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or itsconsequences, are probably a cause of ovarian cancer.The causal factor is unlikely to be tallness itself, butfactors that promote linear growth in childhood. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study255and one case-control study256have been pub- lished. This new information does not change the Panel judge-ment. Also see box 3.8. 7.11.5.3 Lactation (Also see chapter 6.3.3.) One cohort study and 10 case-contr ol studies investigated lactation, most of which showed an association with reduced risk. Meta-analysis of case-contr ol data showed sta - tistically significant decreased risk with increased accumu- lated lifetime duration of breastfeeding, with a cleardose-response relationship. Substantial heterogeneity is par-tially explained by variation in the assessment of breast-feeding when, for example, exclusivity of breastfeeding is notalways assessed. Lactation delays the r eturn of menstruation and ovulation after childbirth. The general mechanisms through which lac- tation could plausibly pr otect against cancer ar eoutlined in chapter 6.3.3. There is evidence that the reduced number of menstrual cycles associated with breastfeeding protectagainst some cancers. There are sparse prospective epidemiological data, though some evidence for a dose-responserelationship. The mechanistic evidence is speculative.Thereis limited evidence suggesting that lactation protects against ovarian cancer . The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-control study257has been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.11.5.4 Other exposur es Other exposur es wer eevaluated. However ,the data wer e either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number of studies too few to allow conclusions to Comparison with previous report 7.11.6.1 General See 7.1.6.1, and box 3.8 in chapter 3. 7.11.6.2 Specific The finding here on adult attained height is new. 7.11.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences, are probably a cause of cancer of the ovary. There is limited evidence suggesting that non-starchy veg- etables, and also lactation, protect against this cancer. 299CHAPTER 7 CANCERS Endometrial cancer is the eighth most common cancer in women (and the 17th most common cancer overall)worldwide. Around 200 000 cases were recorded in 2002, accounting for around 4 per cent of all new cases ofcancer in women (2 per cent overall). It is most frequentin high-income countries. Around three quarters of womenwith this cancer survive for 5 years. It is the 13th most common cause of cancer death in women worldwide (21st overall). Overall, the Panel is impressed by the pattern of evidence showing the importance of physical activity and bodyfatness, as well as factors that affect hormone status, inmodification of the risk of endometrial cancer. The Panel judges as follows: The evidence that body fatness is a cause of cancer of theendometrium is convincing; abdominal fatness is probablyacause. Physical activity pr obably pr otects against this cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that non- starchy vegetables protect against endometrial cancer, andthat red meat, and also the factors that lead to greateradult attained height, or its consequences, are causes ofthis cancer. Life events that pr otect against endometrial cancer include bearing childr en and early menopause, which have the effect of reducing the number of menstrual cycles andthereforelifetime exposur eto oestr ogens. The reverse also applies. See chapter 8 for evidence and judgements on factors that modify the risk of body fatness and abdominalfatness, including physical activity and sedentary ways oflife, the energy density of foods and drinks, andbreastfeeding. In final summary, the strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"pr obable\", shows that body fatness and pr obably abdominal fatness ar ecauses of endometrial cancer ,and that physical activity is pr otective. The endometrium is the lining of the uterus. It is subject to aprocess of cyclical change during the fertile years of a woman 's life. The majority of cancers that occur in the body of the womb are endometrial cancers, mostly adenocarcinomas,4the type included here. 7.12.1 Trends, incidence, and survival Age-adjusted rates of endometrial cancer are increasing in countries under going transition from low- to high-income economies, although ther eis no clear ,overall tr end in high- income countries. This is mainly a disease of high-income countries, where overall rates ar enearly five times higher than in middle- tolow-income countries. Around the world, age-adjusted inci- dence rates range fr om more than 15 per 100 000 women in North America and parts of Europe to less than 5 per 100000 in most of Africa and Asia. In the USA, rates are higher in white women than among those fr om other eth - nic groups, although mortality rates are higher in black women.3258Risk increases with age, with most diagnoses made postmenopause. Endometrial cancer often produces symptoms at relative- ly early stages, so the disease is generally diagnosed early.At around 73 per cent, the overall 5-year survival rate is rel- atively high, although it is lower in middle- than in high- income countries (67 compar ed with 82 per cent). 124 259 Endometrial cancer accounts for almost 2 per cent of all cancer incidence (around 4 per cent in women), but just under 1 per cent of all cancer deaths (nearly 2 per cent inwomen). Also see bo x7.1.1. FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE ENDOMETRIUM In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the endometrium. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence. DECREASES RISK INCREASES RISK Convincing Body fatness Probable Physical activity1Abdominal fatness Limited \u2014 Non-starchy vegetables2Red meat3 attained energy intake Substantial effect on risk None identified unlikely 1 Physical activity of all types: occupational, household, transport, and r ecreational. 2Judgements on vegetables and fr uits do not include those pr eserved by salting and/or pickling. 3 The term 'red meat' refers to beef, pork, lamb, and goat from domesticated animals. 4 Adult attained height is unlikely directly to modify the risk of cancer. It is a marker for genetic, environmental, hormonal, and also nutritional factorsaffecting gr owth during the period fr om pr econception to completion of linear growth (see chapter 6.2.1.3). For an explanation of all the ter ms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. 7.12 Endometrium300PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 7.12.2 Pathogenesis Type 1 endometrial tumours are oestrogen driven, account for around 80 per cent of endometrial cancers, and have afavourable prognosis. 260They follow a clear development pathway, starting with endometrial hyperplasia (an increase inthe number of cells), and are relatively well differentiat- ed. Type 2 tumours are less common, accounting for around 10 per cent of endometrial cancers. Most are associated withendometrial atrophy (wasting), tend to metastasise, and have a less favourable prognosis. Up to 70 per cent of endometrial cancers are reported in women who have no recognised risk factors \u2014 such as those that might disrupt endocrine (hormone) processes. 4Some studies have shown that polycystic ovary syndrome andinsulin sensitivity, which are both components of metabolicsyndrome, may play a role in the pathogenesis of endome- trial cancer, perhaps through hormonal disruption. 261 The tumour-suppressor gene PTEN is also involved in the development of endometrial cancers.260Also see also box 2.2. 7.12.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) Life events .Not bearing childr en increases the risk of, and may be seen as a cause of ,endometrial cancer .262 The r everse also applies: bearing children reduces the risk of, and may be seen as pr otective against, endometrial cancer .258-261There is also substantial evidence that, as with breast and ovarian cancer, late natural menopause increases the risk of, and maybe seen as a cause of ,endometrial cancer .The r everse also applies: early menopause reduces the risk of, and may be seen as protective against, this cancer. 133 Medication .Oral contraceptives protect against this can- cer.133Oestr ogen-only hormone replacement therapy is a cause of this cancer ,144as is tamo xifen . 7.12.4 Interpretation of the evidence 7.12.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpr etation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and bo xes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio sures of effect, to cancer of the endometrium include: Patterns .Because endometrial cancer is hormone related, factors that modify risk might have different effects at dif-ferent times of life. Confounding .High-quality cohort studies eliminate women who have had hysterectomies from 'at-risk' populations. High-quality case-control studies assess the levels of hys- terectomies in control groups. 7.12.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 282 publications were included in the SLR for endometrial cancer. Fuller summaries of the epidemiologi- cal, experimental, and mechanistic evidence are to be found in Chapters 4-6. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.12.5.1 Non-starchy vegetables (Also see chapter 4.2.5.1.) Ten case-control studies investigated non-starchy vegetables, and seven case-control studies investigated cruciferous veg-etables. Most studies showed decr eased risk with incr eased intake. Meta-analysis of case-control data produced evidence of decr eased risk with non-star chy or crucifer ous vegetable intake, with a clear dose-response relationship. There were no cohort data. This is a wide and disparate category, and many different plant food constituents are represented that could contributeto a protective effect radicals and reactive oxygen mole- cules, protecting against oxidation damage. It is difficult to unravel the r elative importance of each constituent and it is likely that any protective effect may result from a combination of influences on several pathwaysinvolved in carcinogenesis. Evidence comes fr om case-control studies only. There is limited evidence suggesting that non-star chy vegetables pr otect against endometrial cancer . 7.12.5.2 Red meat (Also see chapter 4.3.5.1.1.) One cohort study and seven case-control studies investigat- ed red meat. Most studies showed incr eased risk with high- er intak e. Meta-analysis of case-contr ol data pr oduced evidence of increased risk with higher intake, with a clear dose-response relationship. Thereareseveral potential underlying mechanisms for a positive association of red meat consumption with endome- trial cancer, including the generation of potentially carcino-genic N-nitroso compounds (see box 4.3.2). Some meats are also cooked at high temperatures, result- ing in the pr oduction of heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydr ocarbons (see bo x4.3.4). R ed meat contains haem iron. Free iron can lead to the production of free rad- icals (see box 4.3.3). 301CHAPTER 7 CANCERS The evidence, mostly from case-control studies, is sparse. There is limited evidence suggesting that redmeat is a cause of endometrial cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-control study263has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.12.5.3 Physical activity (Also see chapter 5.4.3.) Two cohort studies and 4 case-control studies investigated total physical activity; 3 cohort studies and 10 case-control studies investigated occupational activity; and 4 cohort stud- ies and 10 case-control studies investigated recreationalactivity. Nearly all of the cohort studies and most of the otherstudies showed decreased risk with increased physical activ-ity. Although meta-analysis was not possible due to the wide variety in measures used, comparisons of high with low activity levels showed a consistent association withdecreased risk (figur es 5.4.8 and 5.4.9). Sustained moderate physical activity raises the metabolic rate and incr eases maximal o xygen uptak e. In the long term, regular periods of such activity increase the body's metabolic efficiency and capacity (the amount of work that it can per-form), as well as reducing blood pressure and insulin resis-tance. In addition, physical activity has been found to affectserum levels of oestradiol, oestrone, and androgens in post-menopausal women ,even after BMI. More gen- erally ,effects on oestr ogen metabolism may operate directly, or through decreasing body fat stores. Physical activity is also known to have favourable effects on insulin r esistance, which may also result in decreased risk of endometrial cancer. Physical activity also results in decreased risk of diabetes andhigh blood pr essur e, which ar erisk factors for endometrial cancer. There is generally consistent evidence, mostly from case-control studies, showing lower risk of cancer ofthe endometrium with higher levels of physical activity . Thereis evidence for mechanisms operating in humans. Physical activity pr obably pr otects against cancer of the endometrium. 7.12.5.4 Body fatness (Also see chapter 6.1.3.1.) Twenty-thr ee cohort studies, 41 case-control studies and 2cross-sectional studies investigated body fatness, as mea - sured by BMI. Three cohort studies and six case-control stud- ies investigated BMI as a young adult. Nearly all of thestudies showed incr eased risk with incr eased body fatness, more than half of which were statistically significant. Meta- analysis of cohort data showed an overall 52 per centincreased risk per 5 kg/m 2,or a 31 per cent increased risk per 5 kg/m2as a young adult; meta-analysis of case-control data showed an overall 56 per cent incr eased risk per 5 kg/m2,with a non-significant incr eased risk for BMI as a young adult (figures 6.1.17 and 6.1.18). Heterogeneity exist- ed in the size, but not direction, of the effect. Body fatness dir ectly affects levels of many cir culating hor -mones, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and oestrogens, creating an environment that encourages car- cinogenesis and discourages apoptosis (see box 2.4). It also stimulates the body's inflammatory response, which maycontribute to the initiation and progression of several can- cers (see chapter 2.4.1.3). There is abundant, consistent epidemiological evidence with a clear dose-response relationship, androbust evidence for mechanisms operating in humans.The evidence that greater body fatness is a cause of endometrial cancer is convincing. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study215and one case-control study264have been pub- lished. This new information does not change the Panel judge-ment. Also see box 3.8. 7.12.5.5 Abdominal fatness (Also see chapter 6.1.3.2.) One cohort study and four case-control studies investigatedwaist cir cumfer ence; one cohort study and six case-contr ol studies investigated waist to hip ratio. Both cohort studies and most case-control studies showed statistically significantincreased risk with increased abdominal fatness. Meta-analy-sis of case-control data showed a non-significant increasedrisk. The general mechanisms thr ough which abdominal fatness could plausibly cause cancer ar eoutlined in chapter 6.1.3 (for more detail see box 2.4). The hormonal and other bio- logical effects of being over weight or obese ar eoutlined in chapter 8. Many of these, such as increased circulating oestrogens and decreased insulin sensitivity, are associatedwith abdominal fatness independently of overall bodyfatness. There is a substantial amount of generally consistent epidemiological evidence, but limited prospectivedata. Ther eis evidence for plausible mechanisms. Greater abdominal fatness is a pr obable cause of endometrial cancer . 7.12.5.6 Adult attained height (Also see chapter 6.2.3.1.) Ten cohort studies, 16 case-control studies and 1 ecological study investigated adult attained height. Most studiesshowed incr eased risk with gr eater adult attained height. Meta-analysis of cohort and case-control data showed non- significant increased risk. The general mechanisms thr ough which the factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences, could plausibly influence cancer risk are outlined in chapter6.2.1.3 (for more detail see box 2.4). Many of these, such asearly-life nutrition, altered hormone profiles, and the rate of sexual maturation ,could plausibly increase cancer risk. Although there is generally consistent evidence for prospective epidemiological data, there is someinconsistency in the evidence between cohort and 302PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS case-control studies, and the mechanistic evidence is speculative. There is limited evidence that greateradult attained height, or the factors that lead to it, areacause of endometrial cancer. The causal factor is unlikely to be tallness itself, but factors that promotelinear growth in childhood. 7.12.5.7 Other exposures Other exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number of studies too few to allow conclusions to be reached. These were as follows: cereals (grains) and their r eport 7.12.6.1 General See 7.1.6.1, and box 3.8 in chapter 3. 7.12.6.2 Specific The finding here on physical activity is new. The evidence on body fatness and on abdominal fatness (not consideredseparately ened. 7.12.7 Conclusions The P anel concludes : The evidence that body fatness is a cause of cancer of theendometrium is convincing; abdominal fatness is probablyalso a cause. Physical activity probably protects against this cancer. Thereis limited evidence suggesting that non-starchy veg- etables pr otect against endometrial cancer ,and that red meat, and also the factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences, are causes of this cancer. 7.13 Cervix Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide. Around half a million cases wererecorded in 2002, accounting for around 10 per cent of all new cases of cancer in women (5 per cent overall). It ismost common in Africa, some parts of Asia includingIndia, and in Latin America. It is most common inrelatively young women. Five-year survival rates are around 50 per cent. It is the third most common cause of cancer death in women. Overall, the Panel notes that food and nutrition and associated factors are not significant factors inmodification of the risk of cancer of the cervix, althoughgeneral nutritional status may affect a woman's vulnerability to infection. Life events that protect against cervical cancer include having r elatively few sexual partners. The r everse also applies. Infection with HPV is a necessary cause of this cancer ,and smoking tobacco incr eases risk. The Panel judges as follows: There is limited evidence suggesting that carrots protectagainst cervical cancer. In final summary, there is no strong evidence, corresponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\", to conclude that any aspect of food, nutrition, and physical activity modifies the risk of cervical cancer. The cervix is the neck of the womb. The part of the cervix inside the cer vical canal is called the endocer vix. The part on the outside is the ectocervix. Most cervical cancers start where these two parts meet. There are two main types, squamouscell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Occasionally, mixed car-cinomas, with features of both types, occur. Approximately80 per cent of cer vical cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, with most of the r est being adenocar cinomas. 265Both types of cer vical cancer ar ecovered in this Report. 7.13.1 T rends, incidence, and survival Age-adjusted rates of cer vical cancer ar edecreasing, partic- ularly in high- and middle-income countries, although ther e are insufficient data to derive trends in low-income countries. In high-income countries, the incidence of adenocarcinomashas incr eased since the 1970s, both absolutely and r elative to squamous cell carcinomas. The prevalence appears to be increasing disproportionately in young women. 266 Cervical cancer is predominantly a disease of low-income countries, with overall rates nearly twice as high in middle- to low- as in high-income countries. Ar ound the world, age- adjusted incidence rates range fr om mor ethan 40 per 100 000 women in parts of Africa, South America, and Melanesia, to less than 10 per 100 000 in North America andparts of Asia. However ,rates ar erelatively high elsewhere 303CHAPTER 7 CANCERS in Asia, for example in India and Bangladesh. In the USA, rates ar ehigher among both African-American and Hispanic- American women than in white women. The incidence of many cancers rises with age, but cervical cancer peaks inyounger women, between the ages of 30 and 45. 6However,mortality does not follow the same pattern, and rises with age. Most women in high-income countries, and to varying degrees in other countries, have access to preventive screening programmes that are designed to detect precan-cerous lesions. If these are identified and removed, the inci- dence of this cancer is reduced. After a screening programme was implemented in the UK in 1988, cervical cancer inci- dence (age-standardised rate) has fallen by nearly 60 per cent. 6It is generally well accepted that better access to cer- vical screening programmes worldwide would decrease both the incidence and mortality rates for this cancer.267More recently vaccination against HPV has become a preventive option. The overall 5-year survival rate is approximately 50 per cent: 61 per cent in high-income countries compared with41 per cent in middle- to low-income countries. 124This can- cer accounts for somewhat over 4 per cent of all cancer inci- dence (around 10 per cent in women) but only around 4 per cent of all cancer deaths (just over 9 per cent in women).Also see bo x7.1.1. 7.13.2 Pathogenesis Virtually all cervical cancers are associated with HPV infection (see box 7.13.1), and a woman's nutrition status may influence her susceptibility to this infection. 268 However ,the majority of women with HPV do not develop cervical cancer .Therefore, HPV infection is a necessary but not a sufficient cause of cervical cancer. Women become sus- ceptible to developing cer vical cancer following HPV infec - tion, but other environmental factors are required for the cancer to develop. These factors may include to xins such as polycyclic ar o- matic hydrocarbons (see box 4.3.4) from tobacco smoke, food, or other environmental sources, which have beenfound in the mucus lining the cervix. 269 FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE CERVIX In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the cervix. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence. DECREASES RISK INCREASES RISK Convincing Probable Limited \u2014 Carrots1 suggestive height. Substantial effect on risk None identified unlikely 1Judgements on vegetables and fruits do not include those preserved by salting and/or pickling. 2 Although data suggest that alcoholism is related to increased risk, the Panel concludes that this is likely to be due to factors other than alcohol intake itself. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. Human papilloma vir uses (HPVs) ar ecom- mon. They infect squamous epithelia and generate warts. They are passed by direct contact; genital HPV infections are sexual- ly transmitted. HPV infection rates arehigher in women who have had a higher number of sexual par tners (par ticularly male partners); do not use barrier methods of contraception; and who started having sex at a younger age. Ther earemorethan 100 types of HPV . All can interfere with host-cell machinery that prevents cells from growing and replicating excessively, which are some ofthe cellular mechanisms that help protect the body against cancer development. Low-risk HPVs cause genital warts; high-risk HPVs cause squamous can pr ogress to invasive squa - mous cell carcinoma. The majority of human cervical cancers are associated with high-risk HPV infections. Four subtypes of this virus account for 80 per cent of all cer-vical cancer. HPV infection tends to r emain dor mant, and with repeated infection, the HPV genome becomes integrated within the host cell genome and some cells may become cancer ous. Most HPV infections do not become per- sistent, and most persistent HPV infections do not lead to cancer. However, HPV infec-tion is demonstrably present in 99 per cent of women with cer vical cancer ,and may be present but undetected in the remainder. HPV is a necessary while not sufficientcause of cer vical cancer . There are several stages at which foods or nutrition status could influence pro- gression. Dietary factors influence suscep- tibility to infection; infection can alternutrition status; diet may affect the likeli- hood of infections becoming persistent; and dietary factors have been shown toalter DNA stability and repair. Unfor tunately ,thereis a of epi - demiological evidence specific to HPV at each of these stages. There is some limit- ed evidence that eating vegetables and fruits can protect against persistence. 268 There is also evidence that folate can reduce persistence and independently reduce the risk of precancerous lesions inhigh-risk-HPV infected women. 270-272Box 7.13.1 Human papilloma viruses304PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 7.13.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.)

'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio sures of effect, to cancer of the cervix include: Confounding .High-quality studies adjust for HPV infection. Early studies that failed to adjust for HPV status havereduced validity. 7.13.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 154 publications wer eincluded in the SLR for cer- vical cancer. Fuller summaries of the epidemiological, experimental, and mechanistic evidence ar eto be found in Chapters 4-6. Thefull SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.13.5.1 Carrots (Also see chapter 4.2.5.1.3.) Five case-control studies and one ecological study investi- gated carrots. All of the case-control studies showed decreased risk for the highest levels of intake compared with the lowest, statistically significant in thr ee. The case-contr ol studies all used hospital-based controls and none adjusted for HPV status. The single ecological study showed non-signifi-cant incr eased risk with high intak eof carr ots.Some carotenoids, including beta-carotene and alpha- carotene, which are found at high levels in carrots, are pre- cursors of vitamin A. They also have properties independent of their pro-vitamin A activity. Carotenoids are recognisedantioxidants, and low blood levels of dietary antioxidants are associated with HPV persistence. 276 The evidence, from case-control studies only, is sparse but consistent. There is limited evidence suggestingthat carrots protect against cervical cancer. 7.13.5.2 Other exposures Other exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number ofstudies too few to allow conclusions to adult attained height. Although data suggest that alcoholism is related to increased risk, the Panel concludes that this is lik ely to be due to factors other than alcohol intake itself. 7.13.5.3 Exposures as related to non-invasive cancer outcomes The following exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either too sparse, too inconsistent, or the number ofstudies too few to allow conclusions with previous report 7.13.6.1 General See 7.1.6.1, and box 3.8 in chapter 3. 7.13.6.2 Specific The previous report found that vegetables and fruits, and carotenoids (not carrots specifically), and also vitamins C and E possibly pr otect against cer vical cancer. 7.13.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : Thereis limited evidence suggesting that carr ots protect against cer vical cancer .The evidence is too limited to con - clude that any aspect of food, nutrition, and physical activ- ity directly modifies the risk of this cancer. 305CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.14 Prostate Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men (and the sixth most common cancer overall) worldwide.Around 680 000 cases were recorded in 2002, accounting for around 12 per cent of all new cases of cancer in men(6 per cent overall). It is most commonly diagnosed inhigh-income countries, where screening is common. Five-year survival rates are around 60 per cent. It is the sixth most common cause of cancer death in men worldwide. Overall, the Panel notes the impressive recent evidence from cohort studies and trials demonstrating effects, orabsence of effect, of specific foods and nutrients onprostate cancer. The Panel judges as follows: Foods containing lycopene, as well as selenium or foodscontaining it, pr obably pr otect against pr ostate cancer . Foods containing calcium are a probable cause of this cancer .It is unlik ely that beta-car otene (whether fr om foods or supplements) has a substantial effect on the risk of this cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting thatpulses (legumes) including soya and soya products, foodscontaining vitamin E, and alpha-tocopherol supplementsare protective; and that processed meat, and milk anddairy pr oducts are a cause of this cancer. In final summary ,the str ongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\", shows that foods containing lycopene, as well as selenium or foodscontaining it, probably protect against prostate cancer,and that foods containing calcium are a probable cause ofthis cancer .It is unlik ely that beta-car otene (whether fr om foods or supplements) has a substantial effect on the risk of this cancer. The pr ostate is a walnut-sized gland in men that surrounds the top of the ur ethra; it pr oduces seminal fluid. Its growth and function ar econtr olled by male hormones such as testosterone. Almost all prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas,4the type included her e. 7.14.1 T rends, incidence, and sur vival Age-adjusted incidence rates of prostate cancer increased dra- matically between 1988 and 1992.137This was lar gely because of the increased availability of screening for prostate- specific antigen (PSA) in men without symptoms of the dis-ease. This test leads to the detection of many prostate cancers that are small and/or would otherwise remain unrecognised, and which may or may not develop further into higher stagedisease (see 7.14.2). Rates wer ealready incr easing befor ethe availability of PSA testing, and have continued to increase in middle-income countries where screening is still not widelyavailable. 124This suggests that pr ostate cancer is influenced FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE PROSTATE Inthe judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the prostate.

Although screening is increasingly popular in many high-income countries, its value, for exam- ple in reducing mortality, is controversial. There has been a decline in incidence and mortality in several high-incomecountries since the 1990s although rates remain higher than those recorded before screening became available. This trend may be due to elimination of early stage disease and improved treatment. 277 Prostate cancer is mainly a disease of high-income coun- tries, where overall rates are nearly six times higher than in middle- to low-income countries. Around the world, age- adjusted incidence rates range from more than 100 per 100 000 men in North America, parts of the Caribbean, and Oceania, to less than 10 per 100 000 in Melanesia and muchof Asia. 2This wide range is partly, but not entirely, attribut- able to the increased availability of screening in high-incomecountries. In the USA, rates are higher among African- American men than in white men. 3 Risk increases with age, rising sharply after 40. In most high-income countries, incidence in men below 40 is typi - cally less than 1 per 100 000, rising to more than 1000 per 100000 in those aged 65 and over .278 Average survival for prostate cancer is relatively high worldwide, although markedly more so in high-income coun-tries. The 5-year survival rate is approximately 60 per centoverall: 76 per cent in high-income countries compared with45 per cent in middle- to low-income countries. 124This can- cer accounts for ar ound 6 per cent of all cancer incidence (nearly 12 per cent in men) but ar ound 3 per cent of all can - cer deaths (almost 6 per cent in men; all sites except for non- melanoma skin). Also see bo x7.1.1. 7.14.2 Pathogenesis The disease usually develops slowly and dysplastic lesions may precede cancer by many years or even decades.Extrapolations from autopsy studies suggest that most menwould have pr ostate cancer if they lived to be more than 100. 278The number of pr ostate cancers found incidentally at autopsy ,which had been asymptomatic and not a cause of death, suggests that small, localised prostate cancers can remain unrecognised for many years before progressing to aclinically significant form. Men ar emore likely to die with, rather than from, prostate cancer. 279 280 The incr eased pr ostate cancer incidence in first-degree male r elatives of women who have early onset br east can - cer suggests a genetic predisposition.281Some studies pro- pose that this may be linked to the BRCA genes.282 Growth factors, particularly IGF ,as well as andr ogens have also been implicated in the development of prostate cancers. Serum levels of IGF-1 can be associated with prostate can-cer independently of PSA levels. 283High levels of testos- terone promote cell differentiation, which could protect against the development of this cancer .Therefore, declining levels of this hormone in older age may contribute to thedevelopment of this cancer. 2847.14.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) There are no other established causes of prostate cancer. 7.14.4 Interpretation of the evidence 7.14.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio sures of ratios'. to cancer of the prostate include: Confounding .Screening is associated with relatively high socioeconomic status and also with 'health-conscious' behav - iour such as taking exercise or following dietary guidelines. High-quality studies adjust for these factors. Some case-con-trol studies use cases that have been detected by screening.If so, it is important that control groups are also from ascreened population. 7.14.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 558 publications were included in the SLR for prostate cancer. Fuller summaries of the epidemiological,experimental, and mechanistic evidence ar eto be found in Chapters 4-6. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.14.5.1 Pulses (legumes) including soya and soya products (Also see chapter 4.2.5.10.) Atotal of 3 cohort studies, 11 case-control studies, and 6 eco- logical studies investigated pulses (legumes); 4 cohort stud-ies, 4 case-contr ol studies, and 2 ecological studies investigated soya and soya products. Most studies showed decreased risk with incr eased intake. Meta-analysis of case- contr ol data pr oduced evidence of an association with legume intake, with a clear dose-response relationship. Pulses (legumes), particularly soya foods, contain various compounds that may have anti-cancer effects. These com - pounds could plausibly influence oestrogen metabolism. In addition, phytoestrogens in pulses and soya can have anandrogenic effect, potentially inhibiting testosterone-induced growth of the prostate. The evidence, mostly fr om case-contr ol studies, is inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that pulses (legumes), including soya and soya . 307CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.14.5.2 Processed meat (Also see chapter 4.3.5.1.2.) Four cohort studies and six case-control studies investigat- ed processed meat. All cohort studies reported increased riskwith higher intake; and most case-control studies also showed this effect. Nitrates are both produced endogenously in gastric acid and added as preservatives to processed meats (box 4.3.2). They may contribute to N-nitroso compound production and exposure. These compounds are suspected mutagens and carcinogens.55 Many processed meats also contain high levels of salt and nitrite. Meats cooked at high temperatures can contain het- erocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (box4.3.4). Haem promotes the formation of N-nitroso com- pounds and also contains iron. Free iron can lead to pro-duction of free radicals (box 4.3.3). There is limited evidence from sparse and inconsistent studies suggesting that pr ocessed meat is a cause of prostate cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies285 286have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.14.5.3 Milk and dairy products (Also see chapter 4.4.5.1.) Atotal of 10 cohort studies, 13 case-contr ol studies, and 2 ecological studies investigated milk and dairy foods; 16 cohort studies, 11 case-contr ol studies, and 11 ecological studies investigated milk. Most of the studies showed increased risk with increased intake. Meta-analysis of cohortdata pr oduced evidence of a clear dose-r esponse r elationship between advanced/aggressive cancer risk with milk intake, and between all prostate cancer risk and milk and dairyproducts. Most other meta-analyses show non-significant increased risk. Ecological studies consistently r eport a relationship in the dir ection of incr eased risk between milk or dairy con- sumption and pr ostate cancer . High calcium intake downregulates the formation of 1,25- dihydroxy vitamin D3 from vitamin D, thereby increasing cellproliferation in the prostate. 287Prostate cancer tumours in rats treated with 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 were signifi- cantly smaller ,and presented smaller numbers of lung metas- tases.288Also,consumption of milk incr eases blood levels of IGF-1, which has been associated with increased prostate cancer risk in some studies.283 289 The evidence is inconsistent from both cohort and case-control studies. There is limited evidence suggesting that milk and dairy products are a cause ofprostate cancer. The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR ,two cohort studies290 291and one case-control study189have been published. This new information does not change the Paneljudgement. Also see bo x3.8.7.14.5.4 Diets high in calcium (Also see chapter 4.4.5.2.) Nine cohort studies, 12 case-control studies, and 2 ecolog- ical studies investigated dietary calcium. Most cohort stud-ies showed increased risk with increased calcium intake; case-control studies were inconsistent. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed an increased risk of 27 per cent per g/day; meta-analysis of cohort data on advanced or aggres- sive prostate cancer showed an increased risk of 32 per centper g/day. Meta-analyses of case-control data showed non- significant increased risk. Calcium can be taken to be a marker for dairy intake in high-income populations. In areas outside the USA, Europe, and Oceania, dairy products are not as widely consumed,and the range of calcium intakes is smaller. High calcium intake downregulates the formation of 1,25- dihydroxy vitamin D3 from vitamin D, thereby increasing cell proliferation in the prostate. 287Prostate cancer tumours in rats treated with 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 were signif-icantly smaller and pr esented fewer lung metastases. 288 The evidence, fr om both cohort and case-contr ol studies, is substantial and consistent, with a dose- response relationship. There is evidence for plausiblemechanisms. Diets high in calcium are a probablecause of prostate cancer. The P anel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies290 291have been published. This new informa - tion does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.14.5.5 Foods containing selenium (Also see chapter 4.2.5.8.) Atotal of 1 cohort study ,7case-contr ol studies, and 2 eco - logical studies investigated dietary selenium; 12 cohort studies and 4 case-control studies investigated serum orplasma selenium; and 3 cohort studies, 3 case-control stud-ies, and 1 ecological study investigated levels in nails. Moststudies, including all of those that r eported separately on advanced/aggr essive pr ostate cancer, showed decreased risk with incr eased intak e. Meta-analysis of cohort data on advanced or aggressive prostate cancer showed a decreased risk of 13 per cent per 10 \u00b5g selenium/litre of serum or plasma (figur e4.2.37), or 20 per cent per 100 ng selenium per g of nail clippings. Meta-analyses of cohort data that included all pr ostate cancer diagnoses showed non-signifi - cant decr eased risk. Case-contr ol studies wer einconsistent. Dietary selenium deficiency has been shown to cause a lack of selenoprotein expression. Twenty-five selenoproteinshave been identified in animals, and a number of these have important anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Four are glutathione peroxidases, which damage to biomolecules such lipopro- teins, and DNA. Three are thioredoxin reductases; among other functions, these r egenerate oxidised ascorbic acid to its active antio xidant form. In addition, selenoproteins are involved in testosterone production, which is an important regulator of both normaland abnormal pr ostate gr owth. 308PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS The evidence from cohort and case-control studies is consistent, with a dose-response relationship. There isevidence for plausible mechanisms. Foods containingselenium probably protect against prostate cancer. 7.14.5.6 Foods containing lycopene (Also see chapter 4.2.5.3.) Atotal of 5 cohort studies, 9 case-control studies, and 3 eco- logical studies investigated tomatoes; 3 cohort studies and14 case-control studies investigated dietary lycopene; and 6 cohort studies and 2 case-control studies investigated serum or plasma lycopene. Most of the studies showed decreased risk with increased intake. Studies of cumulative lycopene intake, or of tomato sauce products (from which lycopene ishighly bioavailable), showed statistically risk. Meta-analysis of cohort data on serum orplasma lycopene, which are likely to be more precise and accurate than dietary assessments, showed a 4 per cent decreased risk per 10 \u00b5g lycopene/litre. Lycopene is best absorbed fr om vegetables and fruits that contain it after they are cooked and pureed. The best mea- sures, that tak ethe degr ee of absorption into account, ar e therefore from studies on tomato sauce or serum/plasma lycopene. The Panel also gave emphasis to studies onadvanced or aggressive cancers, which may be better linkedto prognosis than studies that include early stage orunrecognised disease. Lycopene is the most potent carotenoid antioxidant, antipr oliferative effect, r educes plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, improves immune function, and reduces inflammation . There is a substantial amount of consistent evidence, in particular on tomato pr oducts, fr om both cohort and case-control studies. There is evidence for plausiblemechanisms. Foods containing lycopene probablyprotect against prostate cancer. The P anel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies292 293and one case-contr ol study294have been published. This new information does not change the P anel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.14.5.7 Selenium (Also see chapter 4.10.6.4.5.) One randomised contr olled trial and two cohort studies investigated selenium supplements. The randomised con - trolled trial was conducted in 974 men with a history of skin cancers, randomised to receive a daily supplement of 200 \u00b5gselenium or a placebo .Prostate cancer was not a prior stat - ed outcome, and was assessed as a secondary endpoint. The trial showed a 63 per cent decreased risk from selenium sup-plementation. Both cohort studies showed non-significant decreased risk with selenium supplementation. Dietar yselenium deficiency has been shown selenopr otein expr ession .Twenty-five selenopr oteins have been identified animals and a number of these have important anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.Four ar eglutathione per oxidases, biomolecules such lipids, lipopro- teins, and DNA. Three are thioredoxin reductases; among other functions, these regenerate oxidised ascorbic acid to its active antioxidant form. In addition, selenoproteins areinvolved in testosterone production, which is an important regulator of both normal and abnormal prostate growth. There is strong evidence from trials and cohort studies. Selenium probably protects against prostate cancer. 7.14.5.8 Foods containing vitamin E (Also see chapter 4.2.5.7.) Atotal of 2 cohort studies, 13 case-control studies, and 1 eco- logical study investigated dietary vitamin E; and 4 cohortstudies and 1 case-control study investigated serum vitaminE. Other groupings examined were serum or plasma alpha-tocopherol (8 cohort, 2 case-control) and serum gamma- tocopherol (6 cohort, 1 case-control). Most studies showed decreased risk with increased intake. Meta-analysis ofcohort data on serum gamma-tocopher ol produced evidence of an association with decreased risk, with a clear dose- response r elationship. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that has been reported to pre- vent DNA damage, enhance DNA repair, prevent lipid per-oxidation, and prevent activation of carcinogens such asnitrosamines. Vitamin E protects vitamin A and selenium inthe body. In addition to acting as a free-radical scavenger,vitamin E enhances the body 's immune response, which may play a r ole in cancer defences. The evidence on vitamin E, mostly fr om case-contr ol studies, was inconsistent. There is limited evidence suggesting that foods containing vitamin E protectagainst pr ostate cancer . The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies293 295have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.14.5.9 Beta-car otene (Also see chapters 4.2.5.3 and 4.10.6.4.2.) Six cohort studies and 21 case-control studies investigated dietary beta-carotene; 10 cohort studies and 5 case-controlstudies investigated serum or plasma beta-car otene; 3 ran- domised controlled trials and 2 cohort studies investigated beta-car otene supplements. Meta-analyses of 6 cohort stud - ies and 15 case-contr ol studies that investigated beta- carotene from food and 7 cohort studies that investigated serum or plasma beta-carotene produced evidence for therebeing no association with pr ostate cancer risk. One ran - domised controlled trial produced evidence of no associa- tion; the other two showed that it was unlikely thatbeta-carotene reduced incidence, but did not exclude an effect of increasing incidence. Thereis str ong evidence fr om good quality trials and from cohort studies, which consistently fail to demonstrate a protective effect. Beta-carotenesupplements ar eunlik ely to have a substantial 309CHAPTER 7 CANCERS protective effect against prostate cancer. The evidence is too limited to draw a conclusion on a harmful effect. It is unlikely that beta-carotene or foodscontaining it have a substantial effect on the risk ofprostate cancer. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies293 295have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.14.5.10 Alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) (Also see chapter 4.10.6.4.3.) One randomised controlled trial investigated alpha-toco- pherol supplements and prostate cancer. The large ran-domised controlled trial of male smokers given dailysupplements of 50 mg of alpha-tocopherol and 20 mg ofbeta-carotene showed a statistically significant 34 per cent decreased risk for alpha-tocopherol supplements. Prostate cancer was not a prior-stated outcome for this trial. Vitamin E exists in eight differ ent forms (isomers): four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. There is an alpha, beta, gamma, and delta form of each. Each form has slightly dif - ferent biological properties but all are antioxidants. Alpha- tocopherol is thought to be the most biologically activeisomer of vitamin E. It inhibits cell proliferation, can direct-ly activate certain enzymes, and exerts transcriptional con-trol on several genes. Vitamin E may have a direct effect onprostate growth by decreasing cellular concentrations of testoster one, which could impair differ entiation. The evidence is sparse. Ther eis limited evidence that alpha-tocopherol supplements protect against prostatecancer in smokers. 7.14.5.11 Other exposures Other exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number ofstudies too few to allow conclusions to be r eached. These wereas follows: culturally defined diets (vegetarian size and shape; and birth weight. 7.14.6 Comparison with previous report 7.14.6.1 General See 7.1.6.1, and bo x3.8 in chapter 3. 7.14.6.2 Specific The findings here on foods containing lycopene and/or cal- cium, and on selenium or foods containing it, ar enew,reflecting the recent intense research interest in prostate can- cer, including randomised controlled supplementation trials. 7.14.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : Foods containing lycopene, as well as selenium and foods containing it, probably protect against prostate cancer. Dietshigh in calcium are a probable cause of this cancer. It is unlikely that beta-carotene (whether from foods or supple- ments) has a substantial effect on the risk of this cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that pulses (legumes) including soya and soya products, foods containing vitaminE, and alpha-tocopherol supplements are protective, and thatprocessed meat, and milk and dairy products are a cause ofthis cancer. 310PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 7.15 Kidney Cancer of the kidney is the 15th most common type worldwide. Around 200 000 cases were recorded in 2002,accounting for around 2 per cent of all cancers. Average overall survival rates are around 50 per cent at 5 years. Itis the 16th most common cause of death from cancer. Overall, the Panel is impressed by the pattern of evidence showing the importance of body fatness as a cause of cancer of the kidney. The Panel judges as follows: The evidence that body fatness is a cause of this cancer isconvincing. It is unlikely that coffee has a substantialeffect, or that alcoholic drinks have an adverse effect, on the risk of this cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that arsenic in drinking water is a cause of this cancer. Smoking is a cause of cancer of the kidney . In final summary, the strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"pr obable\", shows that greater body fatness is a cause of kidney cancer; and that it isunlikely that coffee has a substantial effect, or alcoholic drinks an adverse effect, on the risk of this cancer . The kidneys ar eat the back of the abdomen and outside the peritoneal cavity .They filter waste pr oducts and water from the blood, producing urine, which empties into the bladder through the ur eter.They ar ealso important endocrine organs concerned with salt and water metabolism, and convert vit- amin D to its active form. Renal cell car cinoma is the most common kidney cancer , accounting for approximately 85 per cent. The majority of these are adenocarcinomas,4the type included here. Kidney cancers also include transition cell carcinomas of the renalpelvis, sarcomas, and Wilms' tumour (nephroblastoma), achildhood cancer .This section refers mainly to renal cell carcinomas; some studies also examined transitional cell carcinomas. 7.15.1 T rends, incidence, and survival Age-adjusted rates of kidney cancer ar eincreasing world- wide. Rates have doubled in many high-income countriessince the mid-1970s, with some of the largest increases in countries in eastern Europe, for example, that are undergo-ing pr ofound economic transition . 137 This is mainly a disease of high-income countries, where rates are nearly five times higher overall than in middle- tolow-income countries. Around the world, age-adjusted inci- dence rates range from 10-20 per 100 000 people in North America, parts of Eur ope, and Australia to less than 2 per 100000 in parts of Africa. 2In the US A,rates ar ehigher among African-American people than in white people. Globally, rates are higher in men than in women, by five tothree. 3Risk incr eases with age, with most diagnoses madein people between the ages of 60 and 80.296 Kidney cancer is diagnosed at an early stage in mor ethan half of cases. The 5-year sur vival rate is about 95 per cent for early stage cancers, and about 20 per cent at the most advanced stages.296Overall, 5-year survival rates are more than 50 per cent in high-income countries, but lower in mid - dle- to low-income countries.36This cancer accounts for almost 2 per cent of all cancer incidence, and somewhat over1per cent of all cancer deaths. Also see bo x7.1.1. 7.15.2 Pathogenesis Urine contains many waste products from food, drinks, and other environmental sources, and some of these are poten- tial carcinogens, such as carcinogens from cigarette smoke, and may play a r ole in kidney cancer. It is not clear whether benign r enal adenomas ar eapre- cursor of renal cell carcinoma. They are similar histologically and are frequently distinguished predominantly by their size. Most adult kidney cancers ar esporadic r enal cell car cino- FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE KIDNEY Inthe judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the kidney.

The con- ventional (or clear cell) type accounts for 75 per cent; 12 percent of cases are of the papillary form,296which are less likely to metastasise. In 60 per cent of conventional carci-noma cases, there is a mutation in the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor gene (VHL) (see box 2.2). 297VHL disease isalso a cause of some familial kidney cancers. 7.15.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) Tobacco use .Smoking is a cause of kidney cancer, increas- ing the risk approximately twofold.10The association is stronger for cancers of the renal pelvis.298 Medication .Analgesics containing phenacetin are a cause of cancer of the renal pelvis.299Dialysis is a cause of kidney can- cer,perhaps thr ough its r ole in the development of acquired renal cystic disease.300 301 7.15.4 Interpretation of the evidence 7.15.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and bo xes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio sures of effect, Considerations specific to cancer of the kidney include: Classification .The subtype of kidney cancer may also be important. Papillary renal cell carcinomas may follow a dif-ferent disease path from other renal cell carcinomas. Some studies also included transitional cell car cinomas or look ed at both r enal and urinar ytract tumours. Confounding .High-quality studies adjust for smoking. 7.15.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 187 publications were included in the SLR for kid- ney cancer. Fuller summaries of the epidemiological, exper-imental, and mechanistic evidence ar eto be found in Chapters 4-6. Thefull SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.15.5.1 Arsenic in drinking water (Also see chapter 4.7.5.1.1.) Three cohort studies, one time-series study, and nine eco- logical studies investigated arsenic in drinking water. Allstudies showed incr eased risk for the highest intak elevelscompared with the lowest. Effect sizes, particularly from eco- logical studies in areas of high exposure levels, tend to be relatively large. Arsenic is carcinogenic to humans and causes chromoso- mal abnormalities. 217Arsenic biotransformation is thought to lead to a state of oxidative stress. In addition, arsenic in drinking water is well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, and both inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites excreted can modify the urinary excre-tion of porphyrins in animals and humans. The evidence is sparse. There is limited evidence suggesting that arsenic in drinking water is a cause ofkidney cancer. 7.15.5.2 Coffee (Also see chapter 4.7.5.4.) Five cohort studies, 18 case-control studies, and 1 ecologi- cal study investigated coffee. None of the cohort studies andonly 1 of the case-contr ol studies r eported a statistically sig - nificant association. Meta-analysis of case-control data pro- duced evidence of no association . There is substantial evidence, both from cohort and case-control studies, which is consistent and of lowheterogeneity, and which fails to show an association.It is unlikely that coffee has a substantial effect on therisk of kidney cancer . The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study302has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.15.5.3 Alcoholic drinks (Also see chapter 4.8.5.1.) Atotal of 3 cohort studies and 16 case-control studies inves- tigated alcoholic drinks; 4 cohort and 5 case-control studiesinvestigated ethanol intake. Studies showed no consistentdirection of effect. Meta-analysis of cohort data on ethanol produced evidence of a dose-r esponse relationship with decreased risk; cohort data on alcoholic drinks wer ehet- erogeneous. Meta-analyses of case-control data showed non- significant decreased risk. It is unlikely that alcoholic drinks increase the risk of kidney cancer ,though a pr otective effect cannot be excluded. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study302has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.15.5.4 Body fatness (Also see chapter 6.1.3.1.) Seventeen cohort studies and 20 case-contr ol studies inves- tigated body fatness, as measur ed by BMI. Nearly all of them showed increased risk with increased body fatness, with none showing a statistically significant decreased risk. Meta-analysis of cohort data showed a 31 per cent incr eased risk 312PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS per 5 kg/m2;meta-analysis of case-control data showed a 205 (adjusted for smoking) or 42 (unadjusted) per cent increased risk per 5 kg/m2(figures 6.1.19 and 6.1.20). There was little heterogeneity in the former two analyses;the heterogeneity in the latter could be partially explained by failure to adjust for smoking. Body fatness directly affects levels of many circulating hormones, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and oestrogens, creating an environment that encourages car-cinogenesis and discourages apoptosis (box 2.4). It also stimulates the body's inflammatory response, which may contribute to the initiation and progression of several can- cers (see chapter 2.4.1.3). In addition, laboratory studies point to a potential role for insulin and leptin in renal cellcarcinoma. 303 304 There is abundant and consistent epidemiological evidence with a dose-response relationship and evidence of plausible mechanisms. The evidence that greater bodyfatness is a cause of kidney cancer is convincing. The P anel is awar ethat since the conclusion of the SLR ,three cohort studies58 213 305and one case-control study306have been published. This new information does not change the Paneljudgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.15.5.5 Other exposures Other exposur es were evaluated. However, the data were either of too low quality ,too inconsistent, or the number of studies too few to allow conclusions to be reached. These wereas follows: cer eals (grains) age at age attained height; and General 7.1.6.1, and bo x3.8. 7.15.6.2 Specific The pr evious r eport judged that high body mass is pr oba- bly a cause of kidney cancer. Since then the evidence for body fatness has become stronger. 7.15.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes : The evidence that body fatness is a cause of kidney canceris convincing. It is unlik ely that coffee has a substantial effect, or alcoholic drinks an adverse effect, on the risk of this cancer. There is limited evidence suggesting thatarsenic in drinking water is a cause of this cancer .7.16 Bladder Cancer of the bladder is the 10th most common type worldwide. Around 350 000 cases were recorded in 2002, accounting for around 3 per cent of all cancers. It is mostcommon in high-income countries. Rates are much higherin men than in women. Overall rates of this cancer are notchanging much. Average overall survival rates vary depending on how soon the cancer is detected. It is the 11th most common cause of death from cancer. Overall, the Panel notes the evidence that food, nutrition, and physical activity are not significant factorsin the development of cancer of the bladder. The Panel judges as follows: There is limited evidence suggesting that milk protectsagainst bladder cancer ;and that arsenic in drinking water is a cause. Smoking tobacco and schistosomiasis ar eother causes of this cancer. In final summary, the evidence is too limited to conclude that any aspect of food, nutrition, and physical activitydirectly modifies the risk of bladder cancer. The bladder is a sac-lik eorgan that is the reservoir for urine. The inside of the bladder is lined by transitional epithelial cells known as the ur othelium. The term 'urothelial cancers' includes predominantly tran- sition cell carcinomas of the bladder and cancers of the upperpart of the urinar ytract. T ransitional cell car cinoma is the most common form, accounting for more than 90 per cent of bladder cancers, the type mainly included here. Othertypes (in order of incidence) include squamous cell carci-nomas, adenocarcinomas, and small cell cancers. 4 7.16.1 T rends, incidence, and survival There is no clear global trend in bladder cancer incidence. While rates incr eased in many countries during the 20th cen- tury, this rise has generally slowed since the mid-1980s or stopped.137However ,thereare exceptions, such as in Japan and countries in eastern Eur ope that ar ein economic tran - sition. Bladder cancer is predominantly a disease of high-income countries, wher eoverall rates ar eslightly mor ethan thr ee times higher than in middle- to low-income countries. Around the world, age-adjusted incidence rates range from20-30 per 100 000 men in southern and western Europe and North America to less than 1 per 100 000 in much of Middle Africa and Asia. 2It is five times mor ecommon in men than in women ,and risk incr eases with age. In northern Africa and parts of Asia, where schistosomiasis (a parasitic disease, also known as bilharzia) is prevalent, bladder cancer ratesarehigh and squamous cell car cinomas of the bladder ar e 313CHAPTER 7 CANCERS the most common type. In Egypt, it is the most common can- cer among men and the third most common amongwomen . 307In the US A, rates are higher in white people than among other ethnic groups.3 Five-year sur vival rates vary according to the stage of the cancer when it is diagnosed. They range fr om 63 to 88 per cent in cases of superficial bladder carcinoma, and from 47 to63 per cent in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.4However, recurr ence rates for this cancer ar erelatively high.308This dis - ease accounts for just over 3 per cent of all cancer incidence, and around 2 per cent of all cancer deaths. Also see box7.1.1. 7.16.2 Pathogenesis Dietary carcinogens, as well as those from tobacco smoke or other envir onmental sour ces, ar eoften excreted in the urine,so the bladder lining is exposed to these toxins. Urothelial cell carcinomas start as superficial bladder car- cinomas. The majority have low rates of progression, although they can occur at multiple sites. Low-risk lesionsmay never progress, but they have a poor prognosis if they become invasive cancers. The superficial lesion that carries the highest risk, carci- noma in situ, progresses to invasive cancer in more than 50 per cent of cases if it is not treated. These high-risk lesionsare often found with multiple papillary tumours, but because they may involve different molecular changes, they are likely to have a different natural history to low-risk lesions. 308 Squamous cell carcinoma may be caused by chronic inflammation, for instance from latent schistosomiasis,chronic infections, or long-term catheter use. Mutations in the tumour-suppressor p53 gene, as well as abnormalities in chromosome 9, are common in invasive bladder cancer (see box 2.2). Inherited mutations of twoother genes, GSTM1 (glutathione S-transferase null) cancer .NAT2 interacts with cigar ette smok e, and may be responsible for 20-46 per cent of bladder cancers. 309 7.16.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) Tobacco use .Smoking is a major cause of bladder cancer. It is estimated that mor ethan half of all cases in men and around a third in women are caused by smoking.10 310 Infection and infestation .Infestation with schistosomes (par - ticularly Schistosoma haematobium )is a cause of bladder cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinomas.311This is esti- mated to be responsible for 10 per cent of bladder cancercases in middle- and low-income countries, and 3 per centof cases overall. 312 Industrial chemicals .Occupational exposur eto ar omatic amines, such as 2-naphthylamine (used in dyes), also increases the risk of bladder cancer.313 7.16.4 Interpr etation of the evidence 7.16.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and bo xes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio of cancer of the bladder include: Confounding .High-quality studies adjust for smoking. FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE BLADDER In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the bladder. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence. DECREASES RISK INCREASES RISK Convincing Probable Limited \u2014 Milk1Arsenic in drinking suggestive water2 Limited \u2014 energy intake Substantial effect on risk None identified unlikely 1 Milk from cows. Most data are from high-income populations, where calcium can be taken to be a marker for milk/dairy consumption. The Panel judges that a higher intake of dietary calcium is one way in which milk could have a pr otective ef fect. 2 The International Agency for Research on Cancer has graded arsenic and arsenic compounds as Class 1 car cinogens. The grading for this entry applies specifically to inorganic arsenic in drinking water. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. 314PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 7.16.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 349 publications were included in the SLR for blad- der cancer. Fuller summaries of the epidemiological, exper-imental, and mechanistic evidence are to be found in Chapters 4-6. Thefull SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.16.5.1 Milk (Also see chapter 4.4.5.1.1.) Five cohort studies, 14 case-control studies, and 1 ecologi- cal study investigated milk. All of the cohort studies and half of the case-control studies showed decreased risk withincreased intake of milk. Meta-analysis of cohort data pro-duced evidence of an association with decreased risk, withaclear dose-response relationship. Meta-analysis of case-con- trol data was inconclusive. The possible effect of milk in reducing bladder cancer risk is likely to be mediated at least in part by calcium, which has direct growth-restraining and differentiation- and apoptosis- inducing actions on normal and tumour cells. 184However , milk includes many bioactive constituents, which may also play a role. The evidence is inconsistent and comes mainly from evidence on dietary calcium. There is limited evidencesuggesting that milk pr otects against bladder cancer. 7.16.5.2 Arsenic in drinking water (Also see chapter 4.7.5.1.1.) Six cohort studies, 1 time-series study, 7 case-control stud- ies, and 11 ecological studies investigated arsenic in drink-ing water .Most studies showed incr eased risk for gr oups with the highest intakes when compared with the lowest. Soluble arsenic in drinking water induces lung cancers in experimental animal models. 71In humans, arsenic is a chro- mosomal mutagen (an agent that induces mutations involv-ing mor ethan one gene, typically large deletions or rearrangements). It can also act as 71These mechanisms may also apply to bladder cancer. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has set aprovisional tolerable weekly intake of 0.015 mg per kg body weight. 72 The evidence is inconsistent. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting that arsenic is a cause of bladder cancer. 7.16.5.3 Other exposur es Other exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number ofstudies too few to allow conclusions to be reached. These were as follows: cereals (grains) total fluid intake. 7.16.6 Comparison with previous report 7.16.6.1 General See 7.1.6.1, and box 3.8. 7.16.6.2 Specific The previous report judged that vegetables and fruits prob- ably protect against bladder cancer. As with other sites, the evidence for these foods is now considered to be weaker, inthis case, very much so. The previous finding that coffee(more than five cups per day) is a possible cause of bladdercancer was not found here. 7.16.7 Conclusions The P anel concludes : There is limited evidence suggesting that milk protectsagainst bladder cancer and that arsenic in drinking water isacause. 315CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.17 Skin Cancer of the skin in its various forms is the most common type of cancer worldwide. Around 90 per cent of all skincancers are non-melanoma. Around 4 million cases were recorded in 2002, but it is likely that many cases are notreferred, and this cancer is not included in the rankings inthis Report. Around 160 000 cases of melanoma skincancer were recorded in 2002, accounting for around 1.5 per cent of all cancers. Skin cancers are more common in high-income countries and among light-skinned people.Overall rates of this cancer are increasing. Survival ratesof melanoma are high and also depend on access totreatment. Five-year survival rates for non-melanoma skincancer are more than 99 per cent. Melanoma is the 22nd most common cause of death from cancer. Overall, the Panel emphasises that the main cause of skin cancer is over-exposur eto radiation fr om sunlight. The P anel judges as follows: Arsenic in drinking water is probably a cause of skincancer. There is limited evidence suggesting that retinolprotects against squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, andthat selenium is a cause of skin cancer. It is unlikely thatbeta-carotene or foods containing it have a substantialeffect on the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer . In final summary ,the str ongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of \"convincing\" and \"probable\", shows that arsenic in drinking water is pr obably a cause of skin cancer. It is unlikely that beta-carotene or foods containingit have a substantial effect on the risk of non-melanomaskin cancer . The skin is the outer covering of the body. There are two main types of skin cancer: melanoma and non-melanoma.Non-melanoma is mor ecommon. The tumours ebasal cell car cinoma and squamous cell car cinoma, which together account for 90 per cent of skin cancers. 4Melanomas are nearly always pigmented and usually develop from pigmented lesions such as moles.Melanoma accounts for 4 per cent of skin cancers. Other skin cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma and cutaneous lymphomas arenot included her e. 7.17.1 Trends, incidence, and survival Age-adjusted rates of both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers are increasing. Rates have doubled since themid-1950s in many high-income countries, particularly those that already had high rates. This trend is restricted to coun- tries wher eahigh proportion of the population is fair- skinned. 137The incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer is also increasing.4It is estimated that there are more than a million new cases each year in the USA alone,314and in Australia the r eported incidence is even higher .315Skin cancer is mainly a disease of high-income countries, where overall melanoma rates are more than 10 times higherthan in middle- to low-income countries. Age-adjusted inci - dence rates range from more than 30 per 100 000 people in Australia and New Zealand to less than 1 per 10 0 000 across much of Africa and Asia. Rates ar erelatively high (ar ound 15 per 100 000) in North America, Israel, and many north- ern European countries. 2In the USA, rates are higher in white people than among other ethnic gr oups.3Non- melanoma skin cancer is the most common cancer in the world, and correlates with lighter skin colour and accumu-lated sun exposure. 316 Although both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer incidence incr eases with age, melanoma causes a dispro- portionate number of cancers in young and middle-agedpeople. 317Melanomas are most common on exposed areas of the body, and are relatively rare on areas that are usual-ly cover ed by clothing. FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND CANCER OF THE SKIN In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of cancer of the skin. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence. DECREASES RISK INCREASES RISK Convincing Probable Arsenic in drinking water1 Limited Substantial effect on risk Beta-carotene4(non-melanoma) unlikely 1 The International Agency for Research on Cancer has graded arsenic and arsenic compounds as Class 1 carcinogens. The grading for this entry applies specifically to inor ganic arsenic in drinking water . 2 The evidence is derived from studies using supplements at a dose of 25 000 international units/day. Applies only to squamous cell carcinoma. 3The evidence is derived fr om studies using supplements at a dose of 200 \u00b5g/day. 4The evidence is derived from studies using supplements at doses of 30, and 50 mg/day, and from foods containing beta-carotene. See chapter 4.2. For an explanation of all the terms used in the matrix, please see chapter 3.5.1, the text of this section, and the glossary. 316PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Despite the considerably higher incidence of non- melanoma skin cancer compared with melanoma (around 20 to 1 in the USA), this less common type accounts for 79 per cent of skin cancer deaths.318The 5-year survival rate is between 80 and 90 per cent in high-income countries, but just over half that in middle- to low-income countries.124This difference is partly due to a different, prevalent type of melanoma (acral melanoma, on the soles of the feet), which has a poorer prognosis. Melanoma accounts for somewhatover 1 per cent of all cancer incidence, but only around 0.5 percent of all cancer deaths. Non-melanoma skin cancers are almost never fatal. 319Also see box 7.1.1. 7.17.2 Pathogenesis The skin changes with age and is affected by hormonal influ- ences and exposure to the sun and wind. Skin pigmentation varies between individuals and its structure also differs,depending, for instance, on whether it covers the lips, the soles of the feet, or the eyelids. All of these aspects influenceskin cancer risk. Both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers are thought to be caused largely by UV irradiation mainly from sunlight. There is a clear relationship betweenaccumulated sun exposure and non-melanoma skin cancer,but melanoma is more common in office workers than in out-door workers, suggesting that damage from episodic expo-sureand extreme occasional sun damage (blistering sunburn) may be mor eimportant. 4The r ole of sun damage is supported by the association between measures of sun sen- sitivity and skin cancer incidence, which is higher in people who have freckles and skin that burns without tanning, more moles, blue eyes, and red hair.320 321 UV-damaged cells ar eusually r emoved by apoptosis (pr o- grammed cell death, see chapter 2.5.2) in a process involv- ing the p53 protein. However, in non-melanoma skin cancer,the p53 tumour-suppressor gene is often damaged by UVBirradiation, so faulty cells are not removed from the skin.Both UVB and UV Airradiation also have direct and indirect effects on the cutaneous immune system, lowering the skin 's cell-mediated immunity , 322which is another factor that may influence carcinogenesis. People who have a family history of melanoma may be pre- disposed to this type of skin cancer ,although only one major inherited mutation has been found, and less than 2 per cent of melanomas ar eattributable to this inherited mutation .323 7.17.3 Other established causes (Also see chapter 2.4 and 7.1.3.1.) Radiation .Over-exposure to UV radiation (mainly from sun- light) is the chief cause of both non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers.324In the case of melanoma, the main cause is episodic skin exposur einvolving sever esun- burn, particularly in fair-skinned .Immune suppr ession in or gan-transplant andAIDS patients is also associated with an increased risk of skin cancer (in addition to Kaposi's sarcomas).325 Infection and infestation .HPV can cause squamous cell car- cinomas, especially in immune-compromised people.325 7.17.4 Interpretation of the evidence 7.17.4.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2, 3.6 and 3.7. 'Relative risk' is used in this Report to denote ratio sures of ratios'. cancer of the skin include: Classification .Melanoma and non-melanoma cancers may have differ ent causes; this would explain heter ogeneity in studies that do not distinguish between these two types of skin cancer. Non-melanoma skin cancer cases are common-ly not recorded by cancer registries, and are therefore under-estimated in many reports. Confounding .High-quality studies adjust for sun exposur e and distinguish between cancer types. 7.17.5 Evidence and judgements In total, 167 publications wer eincluded in the SLR for skin cancer. Fuller summaries of the epidemiological, experi- mental, and mechanistic evidence are in Chapters 4-6. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 7.17.5.1 Arsenic in drinking water (Also see chapter 4.7.5.1.1.) Two cohort studies, 5 case-control studies, 1 cross-sectional study, and 11 ecological studies investigated arsenic in drink-ing water .Nearly all studies showed an association between increased arsenic and skin cancer. Two case-control studies used toenail and fingernail measur ements, which ar ethought to be mor ereliable than dietar yestimates. These studies both showed increased risk, which was statistically significant in one. The single cross-sectional study and all ecological stud-ies showed incr eased risk, with several r eporting r elatively large and statistically significant effect estimates. Soluble arsenic in drinking water induces lung cancers in experimental animal models. 71In humans, arsenic is a chro- mosomal mutagen (an agent that induces mutations involving morethan one gene, typically large deletions or rearrange- ments). It can also act as a syner gistic co-mutagen .Arsenic exposure also causes chronic lung disease.71These mechanisms may also be applicable to skin cancer. The Joint FAO/WHOExpert Committee on F ood Additives has set a pr ovisional tol - 317CHAPTER 7 CANCERS erable weekly intake of 0.015 mg per kg body weight.72 The evidence is consistent, from cohort, case-control, and ecological studies. There is robust mechanisticevidence. Arsenic in drinking water is a probable causeof skin cancer. 7.17.5.2 Retinol (Also see chapter 4.10.6.4.1.) Two randomised controlled trials investigated retinol sup-plements. Both trials included only participants at risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, and both gave results stratified according to this type. While neither trial report- ed a statistically significant association to basal cell carci- noma, one of the two studies did report a statisticallysignificant relationship with decreased squamous cell carci-noma risk. The mechanism of anti-tumour action of the retinoids is not completely understood, but retinol is known to bind to cell receptors with promotion of differentiation, alteration ofmembranes, and immunological adjuvant effects. 326 The evidence is sparse and studies wer econducted on anarrowly defined population group (people at risk of developing skin cancer). There is limited evidencesuggesting that retinol supplements protect againstsquamous cell skin cancer. The P anel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one case-contr ol study327has been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement. Also see box 3.8. 7.17.5.3 Selenium supplements (Also see chapter 4.10.6.4.5.) One randomised contr trial and one cohort study inves - tigated selenium supplements. The trial showed a statisti- cally significant increased risk of total non-melanoma skincancer with daily supplementation of 200 \u00b5g selenium.Subgroup analysis indicated that this risk might differaccor ding to cancer type, with a statistically significant increased risk for squamous cell car cinoma but not basal cell carcinoma. The single cohort study stated that ther ewas no statistically significant association. No plausible mechanisms for how selenium might increase risk of skin cancer have been suggested. The evidence is sparse, and no plausible mechanisms have been identified. Ther eis limited evidence suggesting that selenium supplements are a cause of skin cancer. 7.17.5.4 Beta-carotene (non-melanoma) (Also see chapters 4.2.5.3 and 4.10.6.4.2) Four randomised controlled trials and one cohort study investigated beta-carotene supplements; two cohort studies and seven case-contr ol studies investigated dietary beta- carotene; thr ee cohort studies and one case-contr ol study investigated beta-carotene from food and supplements com- bined; and eight cohort studies and three case-control stud-ies investigated serum or plasma beta-car otene. All three randomised controlled trials that investigated beta-carotene supplement interventions against placebo with respect to non-melanoma skin cancer reported results very close to null. Meta-analysis of the three trials produced evi-dence of no association. Two trials that investigated beta- carotene supplement interventions against placebo with respect to melanoma stated that there was no association with risk. Meta-analysis of cohort data on plasma or serum beta- carotene and non-melanoma skin cancer, and cohort data that investigated the same exposure in melanoma, showed no clear association. No clear association was shown with dietary beta-carotene. There is strong evidence from good quality trials that consistently fail to show an effect. It is unlikely thatbeta-carotene has a substantial effect on the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. It is unlikely that foods containing beta-carotene have any substantial effecton the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer . 7.17.5.5 Other exposur es Other exposures were evaluated. However, the data were either of too low quality, too inconsistent, or the number ofstudies too few to allow conclusions to and body fatness. 7.17.6 Comparison with previous report Skin cancers were not reviewed in the previous report. 7.17.7 Conclusions The Panel concludes: Arsenic in drinking water is probably a cause of skin cancer. Thereis limited evidence suggesting that retinol protects against squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and that sele- nium is a cause of skin cancer .It is unlik ely that beta- carotene or foods containing it have a substantial effect on the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. The main cause of skin cancer is over-exposure to UV radiation from sunlight. 318PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS The Panel also considered other cancers, not generally recognised to have a relationship to food, nutrition, andphysical activity. These are cancers of the thyroid gland and testis, and cancers of the lymphoid and haemopoieticsystems, the musculoskeletal system, and the nervoussystems. Five narrative reviews were commissioned. This method was not systematic, and the Panel decided not to make any judgements regarding the causality of any associations inthe text or matrices. Some of the evidence that emerged may merit more thorough investigation and further studies. The Panel noted as follows : Some of these cancers are known to have as established causes other diseases, tobacco use, radiation, infection, orindustrial chemicals, or else not to have establishedcauses. Some details ar egiven in the following sections. From the reviews commissioned, some evidence emerges. Thyroid cancer .Non-cruciferous, non-starchy vegetables and fish show an association with decreased risk. Body fat-ness and adult attained height show an association withincreased risk. Lymphoid and haemopoietic cancers .Vegetables and fruits are associated with decreased risk. Alcoholic drinks have an association with decreased risk. Meat, total fat, and body fat-ness ar eassociated with incr eased risk. Milk and dair y products show an association with increased risk of non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. Other cancers .The evidence on food, nutrition, physical activity ,and cancers of the musculoskeletal and nervous sys- tems is too limited to draw any conclusions. 7.18.1 Thyroid Thyroid cancer is the 21st most common type worldwide. An estimated 14 1000 cases occurred in 2002, accounting for just over 1 per cent overall. This cancer type is the 23r dmost common cause of cancer death. It is more common in high- income countries, with rates more than twice those of mid-dle- to low-income countries. Thyroid cancer is not usually fatal, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 70 per cent. 2It is increasing in inci- dence worldwide, although this may be partly explained by changing diagnostic practices.124 137 Thyroid cancer rates peak between the ages of 25 and 55, then decline and rise again in the elderly .This cancer is mor e common in women than in men. Also see box 7.1.1. Differentiated carcinomas account for 94 per cent of these cancers (80 per cent papillar yand 14 per cent follicular car -cinomas). Medullary carcinoma and the highly aggressive anaplastic carcinoma comprise the remainder.4 Exposure to ionising radiation, especially during child- hood, is a cause of this cancer.328 7.18.1.1 Evidence The evidence from the narrative review is summarised below. 7.18.1.1.1 Vegetables One pooled analysis of 11 case-control studies (2241 cases and 3716 controls) investigated consumption of vegetables.It showed a statistically significant reduced incidence withhigher intakes of vegetable other than cruciferous types. Cruciferous vegetables were not significantly associated with reduced incidence. Vegetables contain many potentially pr otective substances, including several antioxidants, as well as phytochemicals with antipr oliferative capabilities. They ar ealso a rich sour ce of folate, which plays an important role in the synthesis, repair, and methylation of DNA. 7.18.1.1.2 Fish One pooled analysis of 13 case-control studies (2497 cases and 4337 contr ols) and 2 case-control studies investigated fish consumption .These wer econsistent in showing a sig- nificantly reduced incidence with increased consumption in areas of endemic iodine deficiency ,but none in ar eas wher e iodine intakes are high. Fish is known to be an important natural source of iodine in the diets of differ ent populations, and ther eforean asso - ciation between fish intake and thyroid cancer risk may be mediated by iodine. 7.18.1.1.3 Body fatness One pooled analysis of 12 case-contr ol (cases: 2056 women and 417 men; contr ols: 3358 women and 965 men) and 1 cohort study investigated BMI or obesity .Obesity was associated with a statistically significant increased incidence in women, with a clear dose-response relationship. No asso-ciation was obser ved in men (although this could have been influenced by the relatively small number of cases). The cohort study also showed a r elationship with incr eased incidence. Body size might affect iodine requirement and therefore, indirectly, influence thyroid cancer risk. 7.18.1.1.4 Adult attained height One pooled analysis of 12 case-control studies (cases: 2056 women and 417 men; controls: 3358 women and 965 men) investigated adult attained height. Greater height was asso- ciated with a statistically significant incr eased incidence in both women and men ,with a clear dose-r esponse r elation - ship. The effect was greater in men than in women. Body size might affect iodine requirement and therefore, indirectly,influence thyr oid cancer risk. The association with 7.18 Other cancers319CHAPTER 7 CANCERS height in both men and women may indicate a potential influence of some growth factor or hormone during child- hood or adolescence, but the potential role of growth fac- tors on thyroid carcinogenesis is still poorly defined. 7.18.1.2 Conclusions Thyroid cancer was reviewed in the previous report. It judged that both iodine deficiency (probably) and iodine excess (possibly) were causes of this cancer, and also that vegeta-bles and fruits were possibly protective. The Panel concludes that the associations identified warrant more investigation into food, nutrition, and thyroid cancer. 7.18.2 Testis Cancer of the testis is the 19th most common type in men. An estimated 49 000 cases occurred in 2002, accounting for around 0.5 per cent overall. This cancer is increasing world-wide, with rapid rises in many high-income countries and some transition countries. 124Rates are more than five times higher than in middle- to low-income countries. Cancer of the testis is usually not fatal where chemother- apy is available, with a 5-year survival rate of more than 90per cent in high-income countries, but less than 60 per centin middle- to low-income countries. 26Also see box 7.1.1. Most (95 per cent) testicular cancers are germ cell cancers, with seminomas being the other main subtype.4 The most well established risk factor for testicular cancer is the failure of one testis or both to descend into the nor-mal position during fetal development. 4Rates peak in young adulthood. 7.18.2.1 Evidence The evidence from the narrative review is summarised below. 7.18.2.1.1 Milk and dairy products Five case-control studies, one twin study, and four ecologi- cal studies investigated milk and dair yconsumption. All eco- logical studies and two of the case-contr ol studies showed statistically significant r elationships between incr eased milk and dairy consumption and increased testicular cancer incidence. None of the other studies r eported statistically significant associations, although non-significant associations were heter ogeneous. Thereareno well established mechanisms thr ough which milk could influence testicular cancer development. Milk and dairy products contain fat, protein, and calcium, all of whichmay have an effect on testicular cancer risk. 7.18.2.2 Conclusions Cancer of the testis was not reviewed in the previous report. The P anel concludes that the evidence does not warrant significant investigation into food, nutrition ,and testicular cancer.7.18.3 Lymphoid and haemopoietic system These cancers have different non-dietary causes and there is no reason to believe that they might be affected by food, nutrition, and physical activity in the same ways. If taken together, this group of cancers would be the sixth most common type worldwide. An estimated 749 000 cases occurred in 2002, accounting for around 7 per cent overall. Approximately 48 per cent of these cancers were lymphomas (83 per cent non-Hodgkin's; 17 per cent Hodgkin's), and 40 per cent were leukaemias, with multiple myelomasaccounting for the remaining 12 per cent. 2 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the 11th most common cause of cancer incidence. It is increasing in incidence world- wide.124Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is most frequent in high- income countries, with rates mor ethan twice those of middle- to low-income countries. It is usually fatal, with a 5-year sur vival rate of less than 35 per cent.4This is not a single cancer, but a wide group of cancers (such as Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), each with adistinct geographical distribution, development path, ageprofile, and prognosis. Hodgkin's lymphoma is the 25th most common type. It is most fr equent in high-income countries, where rates are morethan twice those of middle- to low-income countries. It is not usually fatal, with a 5-year survival rate of approx- imately 75 per cent in high-income countries and less than 60 per cent in middle- to low-income countries. 24This can- cer occurs mainly in children, young adults, and the elder-ly (tending to occur at a younger age or in old age in middle-to low-income countries). 124 Leukaemias are the 12th most common type and the 10th most common cause of cancer death. They are graduallyincreasing in incidence worldwide. They are most frequentin high-income countries, with rates mor ethan twice those of middle- to low-income countries. L eukaemias ar eusual- ly fatal, with a 5-year sur vival rate of appr oximately 40 per cent in high-income countries, and less than 20 per cent in middle- to low-income countries. 124However, childhood leukaemias have a ver yhigh survival rate. This is not a sin- gle cancer, but a wide group of both acute and chronic leukaemias. Multiple myeloma is the 24th most common type and the 19th most common cause of cancer death. It is gradually increasing in incidence worldwide, and is most frequent inhigh-income countries with rates mor ethan thr ee times high - er than in middle- to low-income countries. It is usually fatal, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 50 per cent in high-income countries and less than 30 per cent in middle- to low- income countries. 2 Infection with Epstein-Barr virus (see bo x7.2.1) is a risk factor for developing Hodgkin 's lymphoma.329HIV-1 infec - tion, immune suppression (whatever the cause), and tion with Epstein-Barr and human T-cell leukaemia virus risk of developing non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma. 330 320PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Tobacco use, infection with human T-cell leukaemia virus, radiation, and benzene are established causes of leukaemia.1067 328 331Exposure to ionising radiation is a cause of multiple myeloma. Also see chapter 2.4. 7.18.3.1 Evidence The evidence from the narrative review is summarised below. 7.18.3.1.1 Vegetables and fruits One cohort study and six case-control studies investigated vegetables and fruits. The cohort study and five of the case- control studies showed statistically significant associations with increased vegetable and fruit intake and reduced inci- dence of lymphoid and haemopoietic cancers. However, thecohort study and two of the case-control studies reported onnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma only. The sixth case-control studyreported increased incidence with consumption of 'vegeta- bles other than cruciferous, leafy, or yellow/orange'. Vegetables and fruits contain many potentially protective substances, including several antio xidants, as well as phy - tochemicals with antiproliferative capabilities. They are also arich sour ce of folate, which plays an important r ole in the synthesis, repair, and methylation of DNA. 7.18.3.1.2 Milk and dairy products One cohort study, nine case-control studies, and one eco- logical study investigated milk and dairy products, with mostreporting on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The cohort study, the ecological study ,and most of the case-contr ol studies report- ed statistically significant associations between increased milk and dair yconsumption and incr eased incidence. There are no well established mechanisms by which milk could increase lymphoma incidence. Hypotheses include cal-cium r estricting the bioavailability of vitamin D (this vitamin promotes differentiation and apoptosis and inhibits cancer cell growth in the laboratory). Alternatively, organochlorines(which are potential carcinogens) may accumulate in dairyfat. A final hypothesis is that bovine leukaemia virus mighttransmit thr ough milk to humans, although there is no direct evidence for this. 7.18.3.1.3 Meat One cohort study, seven case-control studies, and one eco- logical study investigated meat or r ed meat. The cohort study, the ecological study, and most of the case-control stud- ies showed an association with incr eased incidence, with sev - eral r eaching statistical significance. A r eview article came to the same conclusion. There are no postulated mechanisms by which meat could incr ease the incidence of lymphoid and haemopoietic cancers. 7.18.3.1.4 Fish Two cohort studies and seven case-control studies investi- gated fish and lymphoid and haematopoietic cancers. Moststudies showed a non-significant r elationship with r educed incidence. This reached statistical significance in two case- control studies that reported results separately for non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma.One animal study has shown that fish oils can inhibit the formation of lymphoid and haemopoietic cancers. 7.18.3.1.5 Fat Two cohort studies and four case-control studies investigat- ed fat consumption. All showed statistically significant rela- tionships with increased incidence. One case-control study that reported separately on PUFAs described a significantly reduced incidence for that fatty acid type, while confirmingasignificant increased incidence for saturated fatty acids. There are no postulated mechanisms by which fat could increase lymphoid and haemopoietic cancers. 7.18.3.1.6 Alcoholic drinks One pooled analysis of case-control studies representing 15 175 participants, with 6492 non-Hodgkin's lymphomacases, showed a statistically significant reduced incidence for this type, particularly Burkitt's lymphoma. There are no postulated mechanisms by which alcohol could decr ease the incidence of lymphoid and haemopoiet - ic cancers. 7.18.3.1.7 Body fatness Nine cohort studies and 11 case-control studies investigat- ed BMI or obesity and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukaemia,or multiple myeloma. In each case, most studies reported anassociation with increased incidence, with several reportingstatistically significant r elationships. Obesity r esults in pathological states of inflammation and altered immune responses, both of which are factors that can influence lymphoid and haemopoietic cell function . 7.18.3.2 Conclusions These cancers wer enot r eviewed in the pr evious r eport. The Panel concludes that more work into mechanisms that might underlie the associations identified is warranted. Amore comprehensive and systematic review might also clar-ify the epidemiology .The different cancer types should be investigated separately unless ther eis reason to believe that they have common causes. 7.18.4 Musculoskeletal system Cancers of the musculosk eletal system ar eadiverse group, including those of the bones, muscles, and r elated tissues, all around the body. These include liposarcomas, fibrosar- comas, osteosarcomas, and myosarcomas. These cancers ar eall uncommon or rar e, each accounting for less than 1 per cent \u2014 usually much less \u2014 of all can- cers. There is no reason to think that they have causes incommon. The narrative review did not produce any findings. Because these cancers ar euncommon, any study investi- gating their possible links with food, nutrition ,and physical activity would be unlikely to be fruitful. Because they are diverse, any investigation that grouped all of them togetherwould also be unlik ely to show consistent r esults. 321CHAPTER 7 CANCERS 7.18.4.1 Conclusions These cancers were not reviewed in the previous report. The Panel concludes that it is unlikely that any further inves- tigation would be warranted. 7.18.5 Nervous system Cancers of the brain and central nervous system are the 18th most common type worldwide. An estimated 189 000 cases occurred in 2002, accounting for around 2 per cent overall. These cancers are most frequent in high-income countries, with rates more than twice those of middle- to low-income countries. Brain tumours are relatively common amongchildhood cancers. They are the 13th most common causeof cancer death, and are usually fatal. The overall 5-year sur-vival rate is less than 25 per cent, with higher rates for many brain tumours that occur during childhood, and in high- rather than in middle- to low-income countries. 2Also see box 7.1.1. Tumours of neural tissue account for approximately half of these cancers, with most of these being glioblastomas.4 Meningiomas are the other major type of central nervous sys- tem tumour, with sellar tumours, cranial and nervous system lymphomas, and other rarebrain tumour types comprising the remainder. The incidence of these cancers appears to be increasing worldwide, although the tr end is not entirely clear. 124The causes of brain and central ner vous system cancers have not been well established. The narrative r eview did not pr oduce any findings. Because these cancers are uncommon, any study investi- gating their possible links with food, nutrition, and physicalactivity would be unlik ely to be fruitful. Because they ar e diverse, any investigation that grouped all of them together would also be unlikely to show consistent results. 7.18.5.1 Conclusions These cancers wer enot reviewed in the previous report. The P anel concludes that it is unlik ely that any further inves - tigation is warranted. 322PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS This chapter examines food, nutrition, and physical activity as factors that modify the risk of weight gain,overweight, and obesity, which themselves influencecancer risk. The Panel agreed that as for the other systematic literature reviews elsewhere in this Report, a review of theepidemiological literatur eshould be amplified by consideration of established knowledge on mechanisms,including basic thermodynamics and mechanisms ofenergy input, output, and balance. As shown in Chapters 6 and 7 of this Report, the evidence that obesity, weight gain, and also overweightshort of obesity increase the risk of a number of cancers, is more impressive than was the casein the mid-1990s. Also, it is now generally agr eed that the rapid rise in the incidence of overweight and obesity is a public health nutritionemer gency worldwide. In most countries in Asia, L atin America, and the Middle East, and some in Africa, chronic diseases including obesity are now more prevalent thannutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases. The Panel agreed therefore that any comprehensive report on the prevention of cancer must also deal with theprevention of overweight, obesity, and weight gain. Expertreports that inform public health policy on cardiovasculardiseases have, for many years, accepted that factorsidentified as causes of obesity ar ealso causes of cardiovascular diseases. The P anel agr ees that the same applies to cancer. So unless there is reason to thinkotherwise, anything that modifies the risk of weight gain,overweight, and obesity also modifies the risk of thosecancers whose risk is increased by weight gain,overweight, and obesity . The P anel judges that the evidence that r egular and sustained physical activity of all types protects against weight gain, overweight, and obesity is convincing. Correspondingly ,the evidence that sedentary living is a cause of these conditions is also convincing. Television viewing, a particular form of very sedentary behaviour, which may be associated withsnacking on energy-dense foods, is probably also a cause. Low energy-dense foods \u2014 typically foods that are high in fibr eand bulky because of their water content \u2014 ar e probably protective. Such foods include cereals (grains), pulses (legumes), and vegetables and fruits, and are alsooften micr onutrient-dense, meaning high in vitamins,Determinants of weight gain, overweight, and obesityCHAPTER 8 minerals, and other bioactive compounds. Correspondingly, the Panel judges that high energy-dense foods, in particular sugary drinks and 'fast foods', areprobably a cause of weight gain, overweight, and obesity. Such foods are typically high in fats and/or sugars, contain little water or dietary fibre, and are often low inmicronutrients. The Panel also judges that sustained breastfeeding probably pr otects infants and young childr en against overweight and obesity, which tend to track into later childhood and adult life. The Panel's conclusions and judgements on the dietary and associated determinants of weight gain, overweight,and obesity also apply to cancers for which the risk isincreased by weight gain, overweight, and obesity, unless thereis reason to think otherwise. Within the remit of this Report, the strongest evidence, corr esponding to judgements of 'convincing' and 'probable', shows that physical activity of all types protectsagainst weight gain, overweight, and obesity, whereassedentary living is causative; that low ener gy-dense foods are probably protective and high energy-dense foods areprobably causative; that being breastfed is probably protective; and that sugary drinks, 'fast foods', and television watching are probably causative. Envir onmental factors (physical, economic, political, and sociocultural) ar eextremely important in determining health behaviour ,including that which affects body fatness. Such factors are the subject of a further report to be published in late 2008.323CHAPTER 8 DETERMINANTS OF WEIGHT GAIN, OVERWEIGHT, AND OBESITY Recent and current research shows that degree of body fat- ness (often characterised as over weight and obesity) is a more important cause of cancer than was evident in the mid- 1990s.5As stated in Chapters 6 and 7, the evidence that body fatness is a cause of cancers of the oesophagus, pancr eas,colon and rectum, breast (postmenopause), endometrium, and kidney is convincing; and it is probably a cause of can- cer of the gallbladder. In addition, the evidence that abdom- inal fatness is a cause of cancer of the colon is convincing;and it is also probably a cause of cancers of the breast (post- menopause) and endometrium. Body fatness probably pro- tects against breast cancer that becomes evident before the menopause. Further, rates of overweight and obesity have greatly increased since the 1990s, not only throughout high-incomecountries, but also in urban and even rural areas of many ifnot most middle- and many low-income countries; and not only in adults, but also in children and young people. Obesity in both childhood and adult life can now be seen more as adisease of poverty than of affluence. In 2005, the W orld Health Organization estimated the number of overweight adults (age 15+) to be appr oximately 1.6 billion ,with pr o- jections for 2015 increasing this figure to 2.3 billion. 6 The evidence showing that body fatness is, or probably is, acause of a number of cancers, as well as a large number of disorders and diseases (see 8.2.2), is impressive; and over-weight and obesity are now pandemic, including among chil-dren and young people. For these reasons, the P anel decided to commission this chapter ,and also decided that its assess - ments and judgements should be based on the same princi- ples underlying their assessments of the links between food, nutrition, and physical activity with specific cancers. The Panel agrees that any factor related to food, nutrition, and physical activity that incr eases the risk of weight gain , overweight, and obesity, can also be taken to increase the risk of cancers associated with excess body fatness, unless thereis reason to think otherwise. Thus if regular, sustained phys-ical activity of all types and regular consumption of low ener-gy-dense foods pr otect against weight gain, overweight, and obesity ,then they would also be expected to pr otect indi- rectly against those cancers identified in Chapter 7 as being associated with body fatness. Social and environmental (underlying and basic) factors that modify the risk of weight gain ,overweight, and obesi- ty are critically important and the subject of an associated report to be published in late 2008. 7 8.1 Definitions Humans take in energy from food and drinks, which is used for the body's natural processes and for physical activity.People gain weight if they take in more energy than they use and lose weight if they take in less energy than they use. Excess energy is stored mostly as body fat, laid down at var- ious sites ar ound the body ,regardless of whether the ex cess energy comes from carbohydrates, fats, or proteins, or from ethanol from alcoholic drinks. Conversely, with a deficiencyof ener gy,carbohydrates ar einitially released in the form ofFOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND WEIGHT GAIN, OVERWEIGHT, AND OBESITY In the judgement of the Panel, the factors listed below modify the risk of weight gain, overweight, and obesity. Judgements are graded according to the strength of the evidence. Factors that decrease risk promote appropriate energy intake, and those that increase risk promote excess energy intake, relative to the level of energy expenditure.

These are interpreted as markers of the ener gy density of diets, based on compelling physiological and mechanistic evidence (box 8.1). 3 Some relatively unprocessed energy-dense foods (which tend to be eaten sparingly), such as nuts, seeds, and some vegetable oils, are valuable sources of nutrients. 4 The evidence relates principally to obesity in childhood, but overweight and obesity in children tend to track into adult life: overweight children are liable to become over weight and obese adults. 5 The evidence relates to all drinks containing added caloric sweeteners, notably sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup. Fruit juices are also sugary drinks and could have similar effects, but the evidence is currently limited. 6 'Fast foods' characteristically are consumed often, in large portions, and are energy dense (box 8.2). 7Television viewing (box 8.4) is here identified as a sedentary activity (box 5.2). It is also associated with consumption of energy-dense foods (box 8.1). The evidence relates specifically to childhood and adolescence, and is taken also to apply to adults.

Balance (no weight loss or gain) is achieved when energy input equals output,over time. When body fat stor es increase or decrease, there is an accompanying change in lean body mass, with around three quarters of pr ogressive weight gain or loss represent- ing changes in body fat stor es. As stated in Chapter 6, body mass index (BMI) is the con- ventional indicator of body fatness, and takes account of bothheight and weight. BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared (BMI = kg/m 2). This method does not always provide an accurate measure ofbody fatness. Unusually lean but muscular people have a rel- atively high BMI, even if they have little fat. The BMI crite- ria for risk ar enow supplemented by measures of excess abdominal fat, because this selective accumulation is a par - ticular risk to health. But the BMI method provides a simple measure of body fatness for most people, most of the time. 8 See table 8.1 and also Chapter 6.8.2 T rends and incidence Brief summaries of the worldwide trends in BMI are given in Chapter 1. The mor ehistorical and detailed perspective that follows provides an important evolutionary context for interpr etation of the clinical, epidemiological, and experi - mental data r eviewed. 8.2.1 Human evolution and adaptation Over weight and obesity became a public health issue only relatively recently in human history. Before industrialisation, underweight and weight loss, leading to debility caused byshortage or deficiency of energy from food, were the main nutritional issues. 10Food insecurity is still a feature of life for the r emaining gatherer-hunter and pastoralist commu- nities, and for many agricultural communities in adversesocial or environmental circumstances. Periodic episodes of food shortage are a defining characteristic of any type ofnomadic life. It is lik ely that the human species has evolvedAconcept central to the Panel's thinking, assessments, and judgements in this chap-ter is that of the energy density of foods and drinks. Energy density describes the amount of energy per unit weight of foods or diets. The units of measure are kilocalories (kcal)or kilojoules (kJ) per 100 grams (g). The body derives energy from the macronutri- ents in foods and drinks. The metabolis-able energy of carbohydrate and protein is around 4 kcal (17 kJ)/g; of fat, 9 kcal (38 kJ)/g; and of ethanol \u2014 from alcoholicdrinks \u2014 7 kcal (29 kJ)/g. It follows that of the macronutrients in pure form, fats and oils are the most energy-dense, followedby ethanol; and protein and carbohydrate are least energy-dense. contrast, dietar yfibre generates around 1.5 kcal (6.3 kJ)/g.2Water, like all foods and drinks, requires some energy for its absorptionand metabolism, but its ener gy value can, for practical purposes, be counted as nil. The ener gy density of foods and diets varies depending on the water contentand concentration of the different macronutrients, and of dietary fibre. low ener gy-dense foods and diets arehigh in fibr e, and also in water . Therefore, in terms of weight, they are relatively 'dilute' in energy-providingmacr onutrients. Cer eals (grains) and veg - etables cooked in water, and most fruits, are examples of low energy-dense foods.By contrast, high ener gy-dense diets tend to contain fewer fibre-rich foods and to be relatively concentrated in macr onutrients. Many pr ocessed foods ar eener gy dense.Energy-dense foods are usually high in fats or oils, and/or processed starches andadded sugars. 'Fast foods' (box 8.2), certain baked goods, and confectionery are exam- ples of high energy-dense foods. The ener- gy density of meat depends on the amount offat it contains and how it is cooked. Low energy-dense foods are often high in vita- mins and minerals and other bioactive con- stituents. Processed, high energy-densefoods are often low in micronutrients. There is no evidence that drinking a lot of water with the consumption of energy-dense foods mimics the intake of low energy-dense foods. In general, people tend to consume roughly the same amount of food from day to day, measured by bulk and weight. Several human clinical studies have shown that high energy-dense diets can under- mine normal appetite regulation \u2014 aprocess that has been termed 'passive over- consumption'. 34Higher energy density diets tend to lead to gr eater ener gy intake. Energy consumed in drinks appears to be less easily recognised by appetite control systems than energy in foods. Drinks bytheir natur earegenerally high in water and so, compar ed to foods, have low ener - gydensity. However, altering the energy density of drinks, for instance by addingsugar ,never theless does influence the over - all amount of energy consumed, just as it does for foods, even though the absolutelevels of ener gy density for drinks are lower than that for foods. For this reason, caloric drinks may play a special r ole in contribut - ing to positive ener gy balance.The Panel has given special emphasis to the substantial body of robust experimen-tal evidence, both in humans and in rele- vant animal models, underpinned by the principles of thermodynamics. To reach its conclusions, the Panel interpreted the epi- demiological findings in the light of thisexperimental evidence. Thus, the Panel notes the associations between specific foods and food groups with weight gain,overweight, and obesity, and has inter- preted them, in the light of the experi- mental evidence, as indicating a generaleffect of energy density rather than as several different specific effects of particu- lar foods and drinks. The Panel concludes that energy density is a probable causal factor underlying the observed associations with specific foods and food gr oups, and therefore has decided that energy density is entered into the matrix as such. Similar principles apply to physical activity although, unlike energy density, epidemiological studies estimate this mor e directly. The evidence, compelling on physiolog- ical grounds and supported by experimen-tal and obser vational evidence, is for diets with plenty of low ener gy-dense foods to limit weight gain; and for diets with sub- stantial amounts of high energy-densefoods to pr omote weight gain \u2014 especial - ly when there is frequent consumption of large portions of energy-dense foods anddrinks. Although drinks ar echaracteristi- cally high in water and less energy dense than foods, the same principles apply , within the drink categor y.Box 8.1 Energy density325CHAPTER 8 DETERMINANTS OF WEIGHT GAIN, OVERWEIGHT, AND OBESITY and adapted to favour the deposition of body fat in order to survive food shortages.11 12 Famines still occur in r egions of the world ravaged by wars and droughts, particularly in Africa. In children, poor mater- nal nutrition, inadequate and inappropriate feeding ofinfants and young children, and recurrent infections still cause millions of deaths every year. Therefore it is unlikely that the United Nations Millennium Development Goal, tohalve the 1990 global rate of malnutrition in under -5s by 2015, will be achieved. 13 14 In the past, people in most settled communities possibly lived a lar ge part of their lives in appr oximate energybalance, with adults usually remaining lean, neither losing nor gaining much weight from year to year. This pattern is still evident in food-secure agricultural communities inAfrica, Asia, and Latin America, as well as in those urban areas where ways of life involve a substantial amount ofphysical labour and wher eenergy-dense foods ar escarce. Historically, being overweight has been seen as a sign of wealth, the ability to provide, and a social advantage. Thisis still the case in countries where food insecurity remainsendemic or is a living memory. 8.2.2 Obesity as a public health issue Even in the highest-income countries, obesity was uncom - mon until the 19th century, except among wealthy people who had access to plentiful amounts of food. But with indus - trialisation and urbanisation in Europe, and then in North America and other countries, issues of food insecurity dis-appear ed, food supplies became mor eplentiful, and food generally became more energy dense (in particular, increas- ingly processed and higher in fats and sugars). At the sametime, occupations gradually became more sedentary. 15 Consequently, from the latter part of the 19th century, overweight and obesity were not unusual among middle- aged, middle-class adults in high-income countries; fr om the middle of the 20th centur y,they became fairly common in adults in high-income countries. In low-income countries, and even most high-income countries, there has been a rapidincrease in the prevalence of obesity in the period from 1990 to the present. The rate of increase of the prevalence of obe- sity globally has accelerated during this period. 16 Although obesity was r ecognised as a public health pr ob- lem in higher-income countries in the 1970s,17 18until fair- ly recently it was generally not taken seriously. It wastypically seen by health pr ofessionals and the public as being caused by bad habits and weak will \u2014 obese patients would simply be advised to follow a low-energy diet. Only in thepast decade has there been a growing and wide recognition of the significance of the social and environmental forces that influence the quality and quantity of food and drink con - sumed and physical activity undertak en. 19 Further, until recently, the causal role of obesity in increas- ing the risk of other diseases was not well understood. Sincethe 1980s, however ,obesity has incr easingly been r ecognisedThe term 'fast food' is used in lay publica- tions and in common discourse, as well as in the scientific literature. It is also used as acategory in research studies of food, nutrition, and the risk of diseases, includ- ing cancer. In the literature, the term does not refer to all foods that can be consumed immediately or quickly, and certainly doesnot refer to foods such as fruits. In gener- al, the term refers to readily available, energy-dense meals, snacks, foods, anddrinks. These tend to be consumed oftenand are frequently offered in large portion sizes. In the literature, the term usually refers to 'fast food' served in transnation- al restaurants and the many 'fast foods' created in each country and region that imitate those served in such transnational restaurants. Studies assessed in this chapter (see 8.8) show an association between the con- sumption of 'fast foods' as defined in the literature and a higher risk of weight gainand obesity. These studies examined peo-ple who ate at 'fast-food' restaurants or from takeaway outlets: most of the foods they consumed were high energy-dense products. There is no plausible basis for weight gain being caused by the speed with which a food is prepared or made available. Indeed, many foods can be pre- pared speedily without also being energydense. These studies support the Panel's conclusion that the energy density of foods and drinks is an important determi-nant of body mass. Box 8.2 Fast food Table 8.1 Body mass index as a measure of body fatness Abody mass index (BMI) of between 18.5 and 24.9 is generally regarded as'acceptable' or 'normal'. This is roughly equivalent to 15-20 per cent body fat in adult men and 25-30 per cent in adult women.1The 'under- weight' or 'thin' range is a BMI of below 18.5. Above 25, the common gradings for overweight and obesity are as follows: Classification BMI (kg/m2) Principal Additional cut-off Adapted with per mission from WHO9 The principal cut-off points have been proposed to classify overweight and obesity. The additional cut-off points are used in some countries as useful public health r eferences.9Also see chapter 6.1.1.326PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS as a disease in itself, and also as a cause of several disorders and diseases (table 8.2). Many people who are obese sufferseveral of these diseases, disorders, or disabilities. Obese peo-ple, women in particular, are also more likely to experiencepersonal, social, and pr ofessional difficulties 20and r educed opportunities for employment and advancement.21 Obesity also lowers life expectancy. It is estimated that at 40 years of age, an obese person can expect to live 6 to 7 years less than someone defined as being of 'normal' weight. The UK government has suggested that the average lifeexpectancy of men living in England has fallen because so many are obese.22 23It is also now generally accepted that, to a lesser degree, overweight short of obesity as usually defined is a cause of many of these pathologies (table 8.2).24 8.2.3 Obesity as a global pandemic Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, overweight and obesity are common, and their prevalence is increasing rapid- ly. WHO estimated in 2005 that 1.6 billion adults worldwidewere overweight, of whom 300 million were obese. 25About one sixth of the adult population worldwide was overweight and a further 7 per cent obese. The very rapid rise in over- weight and obesity in children, together with a fast and accelerating rise in type 2 diabetes in young people (box8.3), are particularly striking. Although the very rapid rise in obesity throughout the world was not expected, there is now general agreement on why obesity has become pandemic. The demographic, nutri- tional, and epidemiological shifts that affected the popula-tions of the first countries to be industrialised in the 19th century are now occurring worldwide, and at a faster rate.In 1975, of a global population of ar ound 4 billion , about 35 per cent (or 1.4 billion people) lived in cities or urban areas. In 2005, of a global population of 6.5 billion, about49 per cent (or 3.2 billion people) lived in urban areas: soin three decades the world's urban population has more thandoubled. The projections for 2030 are a world population ofperhaps 8.2 billion, of which 60 per cent (or 4.9 billion peo- ple) will live in urban ar eas: an incr ease of over three times the 1975 figure within the space of one lifetime. 34 Living in cities does not of itself pr edispose people to weight gain, overweight, and obesity; this depends on how people work and live, and what they eat and drink. Daily Childhood overweight and obesity are becoming incr easingly common, not only in high-income countries, but in industri-alised areas in most countries around theworld. 26The most widely used definition of childhood obesity is that of Cole et al.27 Ten per cent of the world's children were estimated to be overweight in 2000. Recent evidence suggests that this pr oblem affects almost all countries and is escalat-ing. 28In many countries, an additional 1 per cent of children are becoming over- weight or obese every year. From the 1970sto the end of the 1990s, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in childr en dou- bled or tripled in several large countries in most regions, such as Canada and theUnited States in Nor th America; Brazil and Chile in Latin America; Australia and Japanin the Western Pacific region; and Finland, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain in Europe. Projections estimate that by 2010,half of all school-age children will be over-weight in the Americas, along with some 44 per cent of childr en in the eastern Mediterranean region, and 35 per cent inthe European region (including the coun-tries of the former Soviet Union) and in thewester n Pacific r egion. 29 Children who are overweight are liable to remain overweight as adults or to become obese.26 30The likelihood of an overweight or obese child becoming orremaining obese in adulthood is increased by their degree of body fatness and the age at which they are assessed. Below aboutthe age of 10, the degree of overweight or obesity is only par tly related to adult fat- ness, while by 18 years of age, obesity is largely fixed. 30Even when adults are not overweight, they may r etain an incr eased risk of morbidity and mortality from having been overweight in adolescence.31 As with overweight and obesity in adult- hood, childhood overweight and obesityare causes of other chronic diseases. Mostof the consequences of obesity take years, or even decades, to become clinically evi - dent, but some are apparent in childhood. Over half of overweight 5-10-year-old-chil-dren have been reported to have one car-diovascular disease risk factor , such as high blood pressure, hyperlipidaemia, orelevated insulin level. 32Children who are even only moderately over weight have elevated low-density lipoprotein choles-terol levels. Type 2 diabetes, almost unknown in early life until recently, is ris- ing rapidly in children as obesity increases.Some areas in the USA experienced a 10- fold incr ease in this for m of diabetes in children between the 1980s and 1990s. 33 Children who experienced growth restriction or ver y low-ener gy diets in ver y early life (and in utero), but who then gained weight rapidly in infancy or early childhood, are especially likely to become obese and to develop type 2 diabetes aschildren and as adults.

Thisincludes manual labour and walking, even when food sup-plies ar e secure and plentiful; and staple foods \u2014 cereals (grains) or r oots and tubers \u2014 which ar e almost always of relatively low energy density (box 8.1). In contrast, ways of life in industrialised cities ar e mor e likely to be sedentar y. Modern urban food supplies are increasingly processed, with products that are relatively energy dense: low in dietary fibreand r elatively high in fats and oils, and r efined star ches and sugars. Modern urban food supplies also include more meat and energy-dense alcoholic and soft drinks. An additionalfactor, in what has been termed this 'obesogenic' environ-ment, is the ready availability and low price of very manyprocessed foods and drinks. This makes it easy for poor as well as rich people to consume mor e ener gy than their bod- ies requir e. 20 35 Obesity is still more common in high-income countries, where about 22 per cent of the adult population (185 mil-lion people) ar e now obese, compared with less than 4 per cent (115 million people) in middle- to low-income coun- tries. 36However , of the six countries wher e more than 60 per cent of the adult population ar e over weight or obese, while three are higher income (the United States, Australia, and Great Britain), three are lower-income (Mexico, Egypt,and South Africa). 37In middle- and low-income countries, obesity, and the diseases caused by weight gain leading to obesity, coexist with diseases and disorders of undernutri-tion in the same communities and families. 38See figures 8.1 and 8.2. In general, obesity is mor e common in women than in men, although mor e men ar e over weight.1Over weight and obesi - ty rates usually increase up to middle age and then are lower in old age. Obesity rates rise first in cities and urban areas;rural communities ar e slower to show this incr ease. 1Of 38nationally representative studies among the very lowest income countries, women of child-bearing age were morelikely to be overweight than underweight, even in ruralareas. 39 Obesity rates var y with socioeconomic status. In a cr oss- country analysis, as national income rose, BMI increased rapidly , then flattened, and eventually declined.40 It increased most rapidly until an annual income of about $US 5000, and peaked at about $US 12500 for women and$US 1 7000 for men . In countries whose gr oss national pr od- uct (GNP) per head is less than $US 2500, obesity in women is more common among those with a high income. 41But even in a number of countries with GNP per capita below$US 2500, such as China, more women of lower comparedto higher socioeconomic status ar e overweight. As countries use mor e money (measur ed by rises in national GNP), obe- sity is incr easingly becoming a disease of the poor . 41 8.3 Regulation of body fatness As stated, the physiological cause of weight gain , over - weight, and obesity is the consumption of mor e ener gy from foods and drinks than is used. Therefore both dietary intake and energy expended, and physical activity, are determinantsof ener gy balance. In particular , the systems r esponsible for regulating appetite to match energy intake to expenditure are crucial. This section summarises relevant points aboutthermodynamics and the physiological mechanisms involved in energy intake, expenditure, and balance. 8.3.1 Ther modynamics The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but only transformed. In humansand other animals, ener gy is supplied by the metabolism of Figure 8.1 Estimates of the prevalence of obesity and overweight in selected countries BMI 25 BMI 30BMI 25-29.980 7060 50 4030 20 10 MF MF MF FPer cent BMI 25 BMI 30BMI 25-29.9 GDP = $US USA Australia UK Mexico Brazil Morocco Egypt S.

Of the energy the body liberates from food, about 10 per cent is used in its diges- tion, absorption, and metabolism. Energy expenditure can be measured in a calorimeter, a sealed chamber designed for this purpose, either directly as heat production or indirectly by measuring the amounts of oxygen used and carbon dioxide produced. The amount of energy metabolised can then be calculated. Studies using calorimeters prove that the principles of thermodynamics,manifest as energy balance, with weight loss and weight gain as described in this chapter, apply both in humans and in ani- mals. 42Such studies were the first to prove that restriction of energy from food results in weight loss.43 Energy restriction to less than is expended will result in weight loss, independent of the type of macronutrients sup-plied in the diet. Recent trials, 44-47however, show that dif- ferent macronutrients may have different effects on metabolism, independent of their energy content. For instance, low-carbohydrate diets cause the body tometabolise carbohydrate stor ed in the body as glycogen; the associated water excreted leads to loss of weight but not, unless ther e is a deficit in total ener gy, of tissue. F oods high in dietary fibre, such as wholegrain cereals and vegetables, promote satiety and therefore may influence weight regula-tion by improving appetite regulation and tending to con-strain excess energy consumption. 48 8.3.2 Ener gy intake and output Human ener gy needs comprise the amount of ener gy used to maintain the body's functions (measured as basal meta- bolic rate or BMR); to digest and assimilate food (diet- induced thermogenesis); and to provide fuel for physical activity. This energy comes originally from foods anddrinks, and is sour ced by the body fr om stor es of carbohy - drate, fat, and protein. Human basal energy needs vary largely as a function of the total mass of lean tissue, which in turn relates to sex, size,and age. Physical activity levels vary from day to day, as doesenergy intake from foods and drinks. Excess intake is stored; these stor es are used to meet the needs of a higher output \u2014 as a r esult of extra physical activity , for example. In pre- menopausal women, basal needs vary to some extent with ovulatory and other cyclical hormonal changes. Usually , body weight and energy stores balance over a month or so. Short-term changes in weight are mostly caused by fluctuations in the body 's stor e of water, not in stored energy. Thus between meals and overnight, the short-term stores of carbohydrate (glycogen in liver and muscles) are mobilised and oxidised, with associated water. This causesweight loss, but mostly of water . Longer -term changes in weight, by contrast, are due to alterations in the body's fat tissue. Therefore substantial daily fluctuations in weight donot reflect changes in energy stores, whereas consistent weight gain (or weight loss) over a substantial period of time does. In undernourished people with negligible fat stor es, weight loss r eflects loss of lean tissue, used for ener gy. In sedentary adults who are not undernourished, changes in weight over a period of time reflect changes mainly in thebody 's stor es of fat. 8.3.3 Energy requirement and balance The energy used to maintain the body's functions (basal metabolism) fuels many physiological processes. These include maintenance of the balance of minerals within cellsand the electrical potential difference across membranes. Energy is also required for processes such as DNA repair and the production of new cells, and for the synthesis of proteins and other structural and functional molecules. The assimi- lation of food involves the production and secretion of var-ious enzymes and hormones that control the flow of nutrient molecules through different metabolic pathways. The regulation of these interrelated processes depends on factors such as general health, age, and also genetic and other factors that vary between people. 49 Tissue deposition during growth in childhood, puberty, and pregnancy and lactation, has additional energy costs.Pregnant women have modestly increased energy require- ments, but many are less physically active during pregnan- cy. Lactating women require about an extra daily 750 kcal(3150 kJ) of ener gy from food. The major energy cost above BMR comes from physical activity (see Chapter 5). For any given weight, BMR is largely a function of the pro- portion of lean body mass to total body mass; this varies withsex and age, and also health and nutrition status. In seden-tary adults, lean mass (and so BMR) decreases with age:older adolescents and young adults usually have higher ener-gy requirements than middle-aged and elderly people. This means that as they age, people need to consume less ener - gy from foods and drinks if they are to stay in energy balance and not gain weight. Energy requirements \u2014 the energy expended by the body \u2014 vary between people. A small, lean, elderly man weigh-ing 50 kg living in the tr opics, who tak es only light ex ercise, might be in energy balance at around 1750 kcal (7350 kJ) per day; whereas a young man weighing 80 kg, who isextremely active as a manual labourer, is likely to need over3500 kcal (14.6 MJ) per day. A sedentary, elderly womanweighing 55 kg might be in ener gy balance at 1500 kcal (6300 kJ) per day ; wher eas a young woman who trains with weights daily might need up to 2750 kcal (11.5 MJ). P ositive energy balance means consuming more energy than is expended, in which case, the body will gain weight \u2014 main-ly as fat, but also as lean tissue, which incr eases BMR. Negative energy balance means consuming less energy than is expended, in which case the body will lose weight \u2014 againmainly fat, but also lean tissue. This, together with other adaptations such as reducing physical activity, tends to mitigate weight loss. In obesity ther e is ex cess stor ed ener gy, mainly as fat but also as lean tissue, which leads to increased energy expen- diture, so that higher energy intake is needed to maintainenergy balance. As people gain weight and their BMR increases, they need more energy from foods and drinks to maintain their increased weight. Over time, a new balance may be achieved, so that no more weight is gained, or the balance may remain positive even at the heavier weight, so thatweight continues to be gained. 50 329CHAPTER 8 DETERMINANTS OF WEIGHT GAIN, OVERWEIGHT, AND OBESITY 8.3.4 Appetite and weight control Humans have many physiological control systems to help balance energy input and output. Underfeeding leads to increased appetite. Eating a meal normally leads to satiation,a feeling of fullness which stops the eating, and satiety, which inhibits the desire to begin to eat. However, humans vary with regard to the extent to which they are able to maintain body weight over years or decades; some appear to main- tain energy balance readily, others can only do so with dif-ficulty. The maintenance of energy balance involves various processes including satiety responses, appetite control sys- tems, and other homeostatic mechanisms. In the main, the control systems are most effective in responding to under- feeding, by increasing appetite, and are less effective atreducing intake with long-term overfeeding. Psychological,social, and cultural factors are important underlying influ-ences on dietary patterns and physical activity. Control seems to be least effective at relatively low levels of physical activity, meaning that sedentary people tend togain weight mor e readily than active people. Conversely , although high levels of physical activity increase energy requir ements and appetite, the lik elihood of consuming more than is needed is lower. In addition, both increased energy density 51and portion size appear to promote over- consumption.52-54 In rodents, various mechanisms have been identified that affect appetite control and weight. Some of these, involvingthe hormones leptin and ghr elin, for example, may turn out to be important for humans. But in humans, ener gy homeo- stasis is most reliably achieved by relatively active ways of life, together with low ener gy-dense diets. It is lik ely, in humans at least, that energy homeostasis operates most effectively within a range of physical activity and so also ofenergy expenditur e, to which humans have evolved since the emergence of Homo sapiens about 250000 years ago, and to which they are adapted.11 55 8.4 Other causes Genetic, social, and envir onmental factors over the life course influence the prevalence of weight gain, overweight, and obesity. A large number of genes are involved with com-plex gene-gene and gene-envir onment interactions. Estimates of the extent to which relative body mass is inher- ited, derived fr om studies of identical (monozygotic) twins or adopted childr en and their biological par ents, ar e consis - tently high, ranging between 64 and 84 per cent. 56 Correspondingly, relatively high energy intake and/or rela- tively low ener gy expenditur e, as well as levels of habitual physical activity, also tend to run in families.57-59 Genetically determined obesity, such as the single-gene defects that cause Prader-Willi syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syn- drome, and congenital leptin deficiency, is rare. Polymorphisms, in particular chromosomal locations linked to obesity in various populations, ar e now being investigated.60 The study of genetic determinants of weight gain is tending to show that appetite regulation and spontaneous physicalactivity , rather than metabolism, have the dominant r ole. 568.5 Risks of overweight and obesity The risk of ill health and of death rises with increasing BMI, from a point well below a BMI of 30 (figures 8.3 and 8.4).61-67 The effects of overweight and obesity in the USA have been thought to be declining because of improvements in the medical treatment of complications such as high blood pres- sure, type 2 diabetes, and abnormal blood lipids.

The monotonic relationship held fordeaths fr om cancer and, more strongly, for deaths from car- diovascular causes. F or other deaths, the incr eased risk in the leanest group was primarily due to chronic obstructive pul- monar y disease and cirr hosis. When death rate is plotted graphically against BMI, U- or J-shaped curves imply that having a low BMI both increas-es the risk of death and r educes life expectancy . But car e needs to be taken to exclude the impact of smoking and of undiagnosed diseases such as cancer, which can lead to unin-tended weight loss well before a diagnosis is made. 68 8.6 Method As already stated (see Chapter 3), a full understanding of the biological factors that modify the risk of chronic diseasessuch as obesity r equires a synthesis of several types of evi- dence. Each type has advantages and disadvantages, and all contribute to an overall pictur e. But ther e are special con- siderations that need to be tak en into account for weight gain, overweight, and obesity. First, this chapter includes consideration of thermody- namics, and the mechanisms of ener gy input, output, and balance, to complement evidence from observational and experimental studies. Evidence on the physiological mecha-nisms, including robust experimental evidence in humans, is abundant. Reliable evidence for mechanisms by which a particular factor affects ener gy balance is an especially important consideration when assessing and judging evi - dence on biological causation. Next, clinical and epidemiological evidence in this area has specific pr oblems. Studies on obese subjects based on theirretrospective assessment (recall) of diet and physical activity are prone to serious bias. Also, interventions that may work in the short term are often ineffective in the longer term. Further, even if specific interventions are shown to causeweight loss, they are not necessarily the same factors that caused the weight gain originally. Finally, because of the cru- cial importance of environmental (economic, social, cultur- al, and political) factors in determining weight-related behaviour, interventions which focus on individual behav-iour in isolation from the environment may fail to show long- term impact. The Panel therefore decided to exclude data from such stud- ies that are inherently problematic from the systematic lit- erature review (SLR) of the clinical and epidemiologicalevidence. The literature review included trials or studies thatran for, or included follow-up of, less than a year in thereview of underlying mechanisms. These were interpreted as contributing to understanding of mechanisms underpinning regulation of body fatness, though not in themselves as evi-dence of long-term impact on body fatness. The failur e of interventions that are successful in the short term to trans- late to the long term is pr obably due to the powerful influ - ences of sociocultural and other environmental factors in determining behaviour. Case-control studies were excluded,due to the special bias inherent in retrospective dietaryreports related to weight gain. Trials that prescribed energy-restricted diets as the intervention were also excluded; onlytrials libitum (unr estricted) diets as the interven- tion wer e included. Studies in childr en under 5 years old were also excluded. The restriction to include only studies in free-living participants means that r esults fr om this SLR are relatively robust and generalisable. 8.7 Interpretation of the evidence Energy balance and body composition Measuring energy intake and expenditure in free-living par- ticipants taking part in pr ospective observational studies is complex. Interpr etation of measur es of energy intake per se is problematic, due to inaccuracies in assessment and the complexity of its relationships with body mass and physical activity. Current techniques are not sufficiently precise to reli-ably detect the small imbalances that lead to weight gain , against a background of much higher levels of total energy intak e and expenditur e. Studies addressing the effectiveness of inter ventions designed to encourage weight loss ar e also difficult to interpret from the point of view of what causes weight gain in the first place. Interventions in free-livingpopulations tend to have r elatively low compliance. Initial weight loss is hard to sustain in the long term, and so long-term studies tend to show less weight loss than pre-dicted by short-term interventions. While the causes of short- term weight loss or maintenance can be identified and understood physiologically , the causes of long-term weight loss or maintenance may be differ ent. W eight-loss trials wer e included in the review and informed the judgements report- ed here, but the causes of weight loss are not necessarily theconverse of the causes of weight gain and obesity .

Self-reported information on food consumption has also been used; this is pr one to similar bias. Consumption of foods or drinks regarded as 'unhealthy', for instance, those con- taining fat, sugars, and alcohol, tend to be under-reportedmore than others. Designs and reporting methods vary between studies, mak- ing it difficult to combine data. For most of the exposuresassessed, many differ ent measures are used. Study results can, and have been compar ed, but meta-analysis was not usually possible. Nevertheless, when epidemiological and trial data are interpr eted appr opriately , and the results are assessed together in the light of biological evidence, this research does identify aspects of food and nutrition, and ways of life suchas being physically active, that ar e the most important deter - minants of overweight, weight gain, and obesity. Social (including economic and political) and environ- mental factors are important determinants of behaviour,including that which affects body fatness. Such factors arethe subject of a further r eport to be published one year after this R eport. Physical activity Measurement of physical activity is complex (also see Chapter 5). When exposur e measurement is less precise than outcome measurement, the apparent effect is attenuated. Most cohort studies used subjective assessment methods. Although all studies ar e prospective, some studies do not allow reverse causality to be excluded. That is, a high BMI at the start of the study may be a cause of decreasing phys-ical activity and may also be independently associated with an increased risk of weight gain. Although many studies adjusted for potential confounders, the complexity of thisarea makes residual confounding difficult to exclude. Trials of physical activity interventions and cohort studies that investigated the effects of physical activity on weightgain var y greatly in size, length, follow-up, inter vention details, and study design, making comparisons problematic and precluding meta-analysis. In the case of physical activ-ity and obesity , cross-sectional data may also be valuable. 69More recent studies report an inverse relationship between physical activity and weight gain. While this could be explained by improvements in study design, publication biasmay be pr esent. Being br eastfed The definition and classification of breastfeeding varied between studies. Some studies included mixed feeding, per-haps in a 'predominantly breastfed' group; some reportedmixed feeding separately to exclusive feeding. In other stud-ies, it was unclear what level of exclusiveness was used. Theduration of ex clusive breastfeeding varied and was not always r eported. Inter vention trials of the effect of breast- feeding are impossible for practical and ethical reasons. Results may r emain confounded, because in high-income countries where most studies are undertaken, mothers from higher socio-economic groups tend to breastfeed forlonger periods, and it is difficult to corr ect for social class completely. 8.8 Evidence and judgements A total of 207 publications wer e included in the SLR for the determinants of weight gain , over weight, and obesity. The evidence from these studies is summarised here and is fol- lowed by the Panel's assessments and judgements. The evidence included obser vational epidemiology, trials, and mechanistic data, with particularly strong and robust evidence in humans, including data fr om short-term trials, which wer e interpr eted as evidence of underlying mecha - nisms rather than of long-term impact. Each of these types of evidence is presented according to the particular expo-sures in the matrix. The exposur es in the matrix r eflect the Panel's interpretation of the causal pathway by which the exposures/interventions might influence the risk of obesity. The Panel agreed that in the particular case of weight gain, overweight, and obesity, the epidemiological and trial evi- dence on cer eals (grains), on vegetables, and on foods high in dietar y fibr e, should be interpr eted in the light of , and as a marker of, their low energy density. It also agreed that, cor- respondingly, epidemiological and trial evidence on animalfats should be interpr eted on the basis of their high ener gy The Panel decided to include evidence on television viewing, which is a discrete and measurable pastime associated with obesi- ty. Subjective methods such as diaries orquestionnaires, and more objective meth- ods such as accelerometers, pedometers, or heart rate monitoring, can be used to mea-sure relatively complex patterns of physical activity. However, all such methods are prone to imprecision and bias. On theother hand, the time spent on single, sim- ple activities such as viewing television can be recalled more precisely, and it is rela-tively straightforward to measure the num- ber of hours someone spends watching television. As shown in 8.8.8, watching television is associated with the development of obesi- ty (as well as with metabolic and cardio- vascular pathology). Such adverse effectsare unlikely to be caused simply by the act of watching television. Television watching is a sedentary behaviour; the degree ofphysical inactivity during television watch- ing appears to be profound compared with other sedentary activities such as reading,or sitting and talking. Also, time spent watching television displaces opportunities for more active pursuits and increases exposure to promotion of foods that maypromote weight gain. Further, watching television may be accompanied by relatively uninhibited consumption ofenergy-dense foods, which may be eaten in large portion sizes. Measuring the num- ber of hours someone spends watchingtelevision not only measures physical inac- tivity, but also a collection of related behaviour. 70Box 8.4 Television viewing332PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS density (box 8.1). Therefore, the Panel concludes that the epi- demiological associations between specific foods, and weight gain and obesity, were probably due to a general effect of the relative energy density of such foods and drinks ratherthan any other characteristic. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 8.8.1 Physical activity Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs)71-73and 16 cohort studies74-89investigated total physical activity and weight maintenance or change in adults. Nine RCTs investi- gated combined physical activity and diet interventions in adults.90-100Ten cohort studies101-110and 1 case-cohort study111investigated occupational activity; 19 cohort stud- ies.73 102 104 106 111-121and 1 case-cohort study111inves- tigated recreational activity in adults; 2 cohort studies investigated household activity86 122; 1 cohort study investi- gated frequency of physical activity in adults107; 3 cohort studies investigated intensity of physical activity in adults.78 102 123Two long-term RCTs,124 1253 short-term RCTs,126-128and 15 cohort studies.129-145investigated total physical activity in children, and 4 cohort studies investigated frequency of phys- ical activity in children.145-148 Total physical activity in adults Two trials showed at least one statistically significant decreased measure of weight gain/body fatness with a phys- ical activity inter vention .71 73One trial showed no effect on weight maintenance.72(See table 8.3.) In the Schmitz trial, at 39 weeks, the inter vention gr oup gained significantly more fat-free mass (0.89 kg, p = 0.009) and lost more body fat (1.63 per cent, p = 0.006) comparedwith contr ols. 71There was no statistically significant effect on weight or waist measurements. The Fogelholm trial showed lower weight regain and waist-circumferencemeasures in the moderate walking group than in either the control or high-intensity groups. 73The Borg trial showed no statistically significant differ ence to weight mainte- nance.72However , resistance training attenuated the regain of body fat mass during the maintenance phase,though not after follow-up. Also see 8.8.4, 8.8.5, 8.8.6, and 8.8.7 for dietary interventions. All nine trials showed a decreased risk of at least one mea- sure of weight gain with interventions that included physi-cal activity and diet advice. This tended to be removed or attenuated as follow-up periods extended past 12 months (table 8.4). The first Pound of Prevention trial showed that 82 per cent of the intervention group maintained or lost weight, com-pared with 56 per cent of the control group. 90The second showed a statistically significant higher weight loss or main- tenance in high-income women and men than in low-income women from intervention, but no statistically significant dif- ference overall between intervention and control.91At 3 years, there was no statistically significant difference.92In the Women's Healthy Lifestyle Project, the intervention groupshowed statistically significant reductions in weight and waist to hip ratio levels compared with baseline. The con- trol group showed no statistically significant difference. 93 94 In Leermark er's trial,95both inter vention gr oups showed sta - tistically significant reductions in weight (-1.6 kg, whereas contr ols gained 0.2 kg; p < 0.01). (The 54-month follow-up showed statistically significant lower increases in low-den- sity lipoprotein cholesterol in the intervention group than inthe control group. 95) In the Harrell trial, the intervention group showed statistically significant lesser body fat than thecontrol group. 96 The P atient-centred Assessment and Counselling for Exercise trial showed no difference in BMI, but a non-signif- icant lower percentage of body fat in the intervention group compar ed with the contr ol group.97The Burk e trial showed no statistically significant effect on BMI, but fewer individu- als in the high-intensity group became overweight orobese. 98The Pritchar d trial showed a statistically significant greater weight loss in the diet than in the exercise group.99 However, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scans showed that 60 per cent of weight loss in dieters was fat tissue,compared to 80 per cent in the exercise group, which alsoshowed better pr eservation of lean tissue. In the King trial, the ex ercise-focused intervention showed statistically signif- icant better weight maintenance than diet or contr ol. 100 Cohort studies in adults All 16 cohort studies showed decr eased risk for at least one measure of weight gain, overweight, or obesity with incr eased phys- ical activity , which was statistically signifi - cant in 12.74-85 Effect estimates (not all studies reported effect estimates) wer e a 0.77 per cent decrease in annual percentage change in weight (95% confidence interval (CI)0.53-1.01) per one-unit increase in physical activity level 89; a 0.32 kg/m2greater increase in BMI (95% CI 0.19-0.46) for not takingexercise, compar ed to ex ercise in men, and a 0.30 kg/m 2(95% CI 0.16-0.44) for the same comparison in women85; a 0.03 kg/m2decrease in BMI (95% CI Table 8.3 Physical activity interventions in adults Author Number of Intervention Length of Length of participants intervention follow-up Schmitz 2003 56 women Strength-training 15 weeks 6 months programme or control (aimed at weight loss) Fogelholm 85 women who Moderate or high- 40 weeks 33 months 2000 had undergone intensity walking a 12-week very programme (aimed at low-calorie diet weight-loss maintenance), or contr ol Borg 2002 90 men who Walking programme, 8 months 31 months had undergone resistance training a 2-month very (aimed at weight-loss low-energy diet maintenance) or control333CHAPTER 8 DETERMINANTS OF WEIGHT GAIN, OVERWEIGHT, AND OBESITY 0.005-0.0001; p = 0.049) per 1-unit incr ease in metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per day83; a 0.91 kg decr ease in men (95% CI 0.42-1.4) per physical activity score unit and a 2.14 kg decr ease in women (95% CI 1.35-2.93)81; a 0.12 kg decrease (95% CI 0.07-0.16) per 0.10 MET change in phys- ical activity level80; a 0.29 kg decrease (\u00b1 0.12 kg; p < 0.02) per log physical activity scor e in women only79; a 0.38 cm decrease in waist circumference (95% CI 0.16-0.60) for anincrease in vigorous physical activity from baseline of 25MET hours per week (this effect was reduced to 0.19 cm(95% CI 0.03-0.35 cm) after controlling for change inBMI) 78; a 2.98 decr ease (95% CI 200 exer- cise units in white women , and change in physical activity was inversely associated with change in body weight in allfour race and sex subgroups (p < 0.0005) 77; a 0.32 kg decrease (95% CI 0.16-0.48; per in current BMI p value for trend 0.042) per 1-unit incr ease in past sport participation75; a 1.09 risk of incr eased BMI (95% CI 1.01-1.17) for the inac- tivegroup compared with the referent in the overweight, and a 0.95 risk of increased BMI (95% CI 0.91-0.99) in the aver- agecompar ed to the active reference gr oup in the over weight subgroup.74One study showed that the baseline physical activity index was a significant predictor of weight gain (cor-relation coefficient of 0.39; p value for trend < 0.05) and fat mass gain (correlation coefficient of 0.40; p value for trend < 0.05) when one outlier was removed (weight regain of appr oximately 40 kg). 82One study stated that ther e was a non-significant trend for lower increases in BMI with increased physical activity.84 One study showed a non-significant association betweenincreased physical activity energy expenditure (correlation coefficient of -0.03; p value for tr end 0.77) and physical activity level (correlation coefficient of -0.03; p value for trend 0.80) and subsequent weight gain .88 Other physical activity assessments in adults Two cohort studies showed a statistically significant decreased risk of weight gain, overweight, or obesity with increased occupational activity108 110; two studies showed statistically significant decreased risk in women only102 105; four studies showed no significant association103 104 107 109; two studies had mix ed results101 106; and one study showed a statistically significant incr eased risk (exposur e was 'lift- ing').111There was considerable heter ogeneity.

A t 1 year, the prevalence of obesity (defined by 95 thskinfold percentile) decreased by 2.7 per cent in the intervention group andincreased by 1.4 per cent in the controls. 124The Sallis trial showed statistically significant lower BMI at 6 and 12 months (p value for tr end < 0.05), but not at 18 months, in the contr ol group. However , boys in the specialist-led gr oup had thinner skinfold measurements at 6 and 12 months, but not at 18 months. Girls in the control group had lower BMIat each time point and this was statistically significant at 18 months (p < 0.01). 125 The Flores trial showed a decreased risk of weight gain with intervention, which was statistically significant in girls only (BMI change -0.8 kg/m2in intervention and 0.3 kg/m2 contr ol). Boys showed similar, though non-significant, trends.126The P angrazi trial showed no statistically signifi - cant difference between the intervention and control schools. However, girls showed a statistically significanthigher activity in two out of thr ee of the inter ventions thancontr ol girls. 128The Neumark-Stzainer trial showed no statistically significant difference in BMI between the inter- vention and control schools, with non-significant improve-ments in several analyses. 127 Twelve cohort studies showed decreased risk for at least one measure of weight gain, overweight, or obesity withincreased physical activity in children, which was statistically significant in 11 (including the 2 cohort studies that used objective measures to assess physical activity). 132-145Three studies stated that ther e was no statistically significant association.129-131 General mechanisms The general mechanisms through which physical activity could plausibly protect against weight gain, overweight, andobesity are outlined in 8.3 and in Chapter 5. In addition, animportant physiological consequence of physical activity isfat oxidation, although this effect may be attenuated in obese people. R egular ex ercise has been shown to increase fat oxidation in both healthy and obese people, a mechanism that is thought to occur as a result of improved insulin sensitivity, 149although this effect may be attenuated in obese people. Evidence has shown that physical activity could potentially influence appetite control by: increasing the sensitivity of satiety signals; altering food choice or macr o- nutrient pr eference; and modifying the pleasur e response to food, which may elevate hunger, food intake, and body weight. Short- and medium-term studies have, however,shown that individuals can tolerate substantial negative energy balance during sustained physical activity, thus result- ing in weight loss. Eventually, food intake will increase tocompensate for the exercise-induced energy loss, although the degree of compensation may vary greatly between individuals. 150 The epidemiological evidence on physical activity is substantial and consistent. There is robust mechanisticevidence, particularly in r elation to its impact on Table 8.5 Physical activity interventions in children Author Number of Intervention Length of Length of participants intervention follow-up Mo-Suwan 1998 292 kindergarten children Randomised by class (n=10) into exercise or 29-30 weeks 12 months control group Sallis 1993 549 school children Randomised by school to specialist-led or - 18 months (mean age 9.25) teacher-led physical activity programme, or control condition Flores 1995 110 children Randomised by class to Dance for Health 12 weeks - (mean age 12.6) or control conditions Pangrazi 2003 606 children Randomised by school to usual physical 12 weeks - (mean age 9.8) education, PLAY (Promoting Lifetime Activity for Youth) (intervention) and PLAY plus usual physical education and control (no physical education or PLAY) Neumark-Sztainer 2003 201 physically inactive Randomised by school to multicomponent 24 weeks - girls (mean age 14.9 physical education class or control.

Overall, the evidence that all types of physical activity protectagainst weight gain, overweight, and obesity isconvincing. It has this effect by promoting appropriateenergy intake. Conversely, the evidence can beinterpreted as showing that sedentary living is a causeof weight gain, overweight, and obesity. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, nine RCTs151-159and four cohort studies160-163have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). 8.8.2 Sedentary living One RCT investigated physical inactivity in children164(see table 8.6) and three cohort studies investigated physical inac-tivity in adults. 87 122 165In addition, one RCT164and 16 cohort studies129 143 147 166-178investigated television viewing. These data are summarised separately in 8.8.8. Television viewingis a behaviour that usually involves being highly sedentar y, although other activities, such as snacking, are also associ- ated with it (see bo x 8.4). Sedentary living involves a high level of inactivity, with low levels of activity. The data reviewed here relate to phys-ical inactivity, which is only one component of sedentary liv-ing. Somebody who is inactive for considerable periods oftime might also engage in regular, moderate, or vigorousphysical activity at other times, and ther efore not be seden- tary. The strong mechanistic evidence on the effects of sedentary living, particularly in an environment with easy access to fr equent, lar ge portions of high ener gy-dense foods, contribute to the Panel's judgement on sedentary living. The single trial showed no significant relationship between sedentar y living and BMI. P ost-inter vention , BMI was unchanged, but behaviour such as the number of children watching more than 2 hours of television per day was sig-nificantly lower in the intervention group, as was total num-ber of hours watched. 164 Two cohort studies showed increased risk of weight gain with incr eased sitting time.122 165One study stated that ther e was no statistically significant r elationship.87Effect estimates were 1.28 (95% CI 1.04-1.58) for the risk of becoming obese in those sitting at work, or away from home, or driving formore than 40 hours per week compared with less than 1 hour a week; 1.11 (95% CI 0.85-1.45) in those who spent > 40 hours a week sitting at home compar ed with 0-1 hours per week 122; and 0.80 (95% CI 0.70-0.91) for the lik elihood of weight maintenance (vs weight gain) with a low (< 33hours per week) compared with high ( /c4753 52 hours per week) sitting time.165 The general mechanisms through which sedentary living could plausibly cause weight gain, overweight, and obesityare outlined above and in Chapter 5. The epidemiological evidence that sedentary living causes weight gain, overweight, and obesity isrelatively sparse, but there is robust mechanisticevidence in humans. The Panel concludes that the evidence that sedentary living causes weight gain, overweight, and obesity is convincing. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one cohort study179and one case-control study180have been pub- lished. This new information does not change the Panel judge-ment (see box 3.8). 8.8.3 Being breastfed Two published SLRs181 thr ee subsequent studies98 171 183investigated being breastfed. The lar ger literatur e review included 61 studies that inves - tigated being breastfed and later risk of obesity, of which 43 were cohort studies, 15 were cross-sectional studies, and 3were case-control studies. 182It showed a statistically signif- icant decreased risk of obesity with breastfeeding. Meta-analysis was possible on 28 studies, giving a summary effectestimate of 0.87 (95% CI 0.85-0.89) for br eastfeeding com- pared with formula feeding. Only two studies looked at adult obesity; the rest assessed obesity in those under 18 years. This effect was attenuated, but still statistically significant, when only the six studies that adjusted for parental obesity, maternal smoking, and socialclass wer e included, with an effect estimate of 0.93 (95% CI 0.88-0.99). 182 The smaller literature review included 28 studies that investigated being breastfed and risk of obesity in later child-hood. 181It showed a statistically significant decreased risk of obesity with br eastfeeding. Meta-analysis was possible on nine studies (two cohort studies and seven cr oss-sectional studies), giving an adjusted summar y effect estimate of 0.78 (95% CI 0.71-0.85) for breastfeeding compared with not. The assessment of exposure to breastfeeding differedbetween studies. One study compar ed children who were mostly or only breastfed in their first 6 months with those who wer e mostly or only formula-fed, while most of the stud - ies compar ed childr en who wer e never br eastfed with chil - dren always breastfed. Again, the effect was attenuated when only maximally adjusted studies wereincluded. All three cohort studies published after the conclusion of the above-mentioned litera-ture reviews showed decreased risk of obe- sity with breastfeeding. 98 171 183However, the effect was not statistically significant whenfully adjusted in two studies, 171 183and one study showed a decreased risk of obesity, which was statistically significant in adoles-cence but not adulthood. 98Effect estimates Table 8.6 Sedentary behaviour interventions in children Author Number of Intervention Length of Length of participants intervention follow-up Dennison 176 children Randomised by daycare 12 weeks - 2004 from middle- centre (n=18) into income families intervention that addressed (mean age 4.0) nutrition, reducing sedentary behaviours, or control group336PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS were 0.70 (95% CI 0.54-0.91; minimally adjusted) but 1.22 (95% CI 0.87-1.71) in the final model171; and 0.15 (95% CI 0.03-0.72) for being obese in adolescence and 0.34 (95% CI 0.12-1.01) for being obese in adulthood.98One regression coefficient of -0.30 (95% CI -0.053 to -0.007; p value for trend 0.012) and BMI at age 8 years after adjustment for sex.183The study stated that breastfeeding was not a statistically significant predictor of BMI after mul- tivariate adjustment. General mechanisms Exclusively breastfed children show different growth patterns from those of formula-fed infants (also see chapter 6.2). Breastfed infants consume less total energy and less proteinthan formula-fed infants. 184It is possible that the bioactive factors in human milk could modulate energy metabolism,a process in which leptin (present in human milk but not for- mula) may be implicated. Alternatively, the effect of elevat- ed protein intake and plasma insulin concentrations informula-fed babies could stimulate fat deposition and early adipocyte development. The epidemiological and mechanistic evidence that being breastfed protects against overweight andobesity is substantial and generally consistent. Whilethere are some issues to do with measurement andconfounding, there is evidence for plausiblemechanisms. Being br eastfed is probably protective. The epidemiological evidence r elates to childhood overweight and obesity; overweight children tend tobecome obese adults. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, three cohort studies185-187have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). 8.8.4 Low energy-dense foods The P anel decided to gr oup the epidemiological evidence on foods that ar e low in ener gy (box 8.1) into this general categor y. This decision was informed by the mechanistic evidence. Nutrition inter ventions Fourteen randomised controlled trials investigated dietary interventions and weight loss, and pr evention of weight gain, overweight, or obesity .45 188-200Most trials incr eased the pr o- portion of low energy-dense foods and drinks in people's diets. However, the stated aims of trials varied and some maynot be dir ectly r elevant. In particular , low-carbohydrate diets seem to lead to energy reduction with high energy density, but the long-term health impact of such diets is not known(see table 8.7). All trials showed that restricted energy diets decreased the risk of weight gain , overweight, and obesity. All trials also showed that incr easing the consumption of low ener gy-dense foods and decreasing the consumption of high energy-dense foods in diets decreased risk of weight gain, overweight, andobesity . Some found that these varied appr oaches wer e moreeffective than general energy restriction; some did not. Most trials with sufficient follow-up periods also showed that weight loss was not commonly maintained after the intervention ended. The Matvienko trial showed no significant difference from analysis of the whole dataset, although participants with higher initial BMI showed improved weight maintenance with intervention, with statistically significant weight gain in the control group. 200The Epstein trial showed non- significant weight loss in both intervention groups, with a non-significantly greater weight loss in the decreased fat and sugar group.199The Swinburn trial showed statistically significant weight loss with the low-fat diet at one year, but no significant difference at five years.195The Flemming trial showed statistically significant weight loss with the low-fatdiet and calorie-controlled interventions. 197The Dansinger trial showed statistically significant weight loss for all diets and no significant difference between them.198The Harvey- Berino trial showed statistically significant greater weightloss with calorie r estriction than with the low-fat diet. 196The Jeffery trial showed statistically significant greater weightloss with the low-fat diet at the end of the inter vention; after follow-up, both groups had returned to their original weights. 194The Sheppard trial showed statistically significant greater weight loss in the low-fat diet group.193The Shah trial showed no statistically significant difference in weightloss between the low-fat and low-calorie diets. 192The Foster trial showed statistically significant gr eater weight loss for the low carbohydrate diet at thr ee and six months, but a non- significant greater weight loss at one year.45The Stern trial showed a non-significant gr eater weight loss with the low- carbohydrate diet than the calorie-restricted diet.191The Ebbeling trial showed statistically significant greater weightloss with the r educed glycaemic load trial. 190The Simkin- Silverman trial showed statistically significant greater weightloss and/or maintenance for the intervention group. 189The Toubro trial showed no significant difference between thetwo weight-loss regimes, but did show statistically significantmaintenance (less r egained weight) in the ad libitum main- tenance r egime than in the fix ed energy group. 188 8.8.4.1 Wholegrain cereals and cereal products Four cohort studies investigated wholegrain cereals and cereal products. All four cohort studies showed decreased risk of weight gain and/or obesity for the highest intak e group when com- pared with the lowest, which was statistically significant in two.201-204The two statistically significant results were both from studies that investigated all food sources of whole-grains. Effect estimates for higher wholegrain intak e wer e 0.81 (95% CI 0.73-0.91; p for trend 0.0002) for obe- sity and 0.77 (95% CI 0.59-1.01; p value for trend 0.03) formajor weight gain 204; decreased weight gain with greater total wholegrain intake (p value for trend < 0.0001)203; regression coefficients of -0.07 (95% CI -0.30 to men and -0.20 (95% CI -0.49 to 0.09) for women for wholegrain bread intake and waist cir- cumference 202; and 0.91 (95% CI 0.79-1.05; p value for trend 0.13) for the r elationship between wholegrain br eak- 337CHAPTER 8 DETERMINANTS OF WEIGHT GAIN, OVERWEIGHT, AND OBESITY fast cereal intake and risk of being overweight.201 Definitions of wholegrain foods r emain contentious (see box 4.1.1). Wholegrains (consisting of the grain endosperm, germ, and bran) provide an abundant source of dietary fibre, resis- tant starch, phytoestrogens, antioxidants, and other micronu-trients (see chapter 4.1). The primar y mechanism for an effect on weight gain is through low-energy density. However , ther e are other mechanisms through which whole- grains may have a physiological effect on weight gain . For instance, several studies have demonstrated a positive rela- tion between wholegrain consumption and improved bloodinsulin pr ofiles, which could pr ovide an indir ect mechanism. Wholegrain cereals and cereal products are assessed here as high-fibre foods and as a marker for lowenergy-dense foods. For this reason, no separatejudgement is made for wholegrain cer eals and cereal products. 8.8.4.2 Foods containing dietary fibre Six cohort studies investigated foods containing fibr e, fourin adults and two in children.115 173 203-206 Five cohort studies showed decreased risk of weight gain and/or obesity for the highest intak e group when compared with the lowest,115 203-206which was statistically significant in three.203-205One study (in children) showed a non-signif- icant decreased risk in boys and a non-significant increasedrisk in girls. 173Of the two studies that showed non-signifi - cant decreased risk, one investigated the relationship between infant diets and adolescent obesity .206Effect esti - mates in adults wer e 0.51 (95% CI 0.39-0.67; p value for trend < 0.0001) for overweight and 0.66 (95% CI 0.58-0.74; p value for trend < 0.0001) for obesity204; p value for tr end /c4753 0.001 for weight gain (no effect esti - mate)205; 0.39 standard deviation (SD) g per day weight change (\u00b1 0.2) for the highest intake group and 1.4 SD gper day weight change (\u00b1 0.2) for the lowest, p value for trend < 0.0001 203; and the univariate model (adjusted for retirement (yes/no); type of job (sedentary or active); inter- action between r etirement and type of job; age; smoking; and the base level of the behaviour) showed a regression coefficient of -0.31, p value for trend < 0.01, and the mul-tivariable model (additionally adjusted for all other behav - Table 8.7 Nutrition interventions Author Number of Intervention Length of Length of participants intervention follow-up Matvienko 2001 40 female young adults Nutrition education 4 months 16 months Epstein 2001 26 children with at least one Increased vegetables and fruits of decreased 12 months - obese parent - and their fat and sugar intake families Dansinger 2005 160 adults with one obesity- Low-carbohydrate diet, low-fat diet, calorie 12 months - related comorbidity restriction, and macronutrient balance Flemming 2002 100 otherwise healthy overweight High, moderate, and low-fat diet compared 12 months - or obese adults with a calorie-controlled group Harvey-Berino 1999 80 otherwise healthy overweight Low-fat diet or low-calorie diet 24 weeks - or obese adults Swinburn 2001 103 adults with one obesity- Low-fat diet or general dietary advice 12 months 5 years related comorbidity Jeffery 1995 74 moderately obese but Low-fat diet or low-calorie intervention 18 months - otherwise healthy women Sheppard 1991 303 women at increased Low-fat diet or other intervention 12 months - risk of breast cancer Shah 1996 122 over weight but other wise Low-fat diet or low-calorie diet 6 months 12 months healthy women (data only available for 75) Foster 2003 63 obese but otherwise Low-carbohydrate diet (Atkins) compared 6 months 12 months healthy people with low-calorie diet Stern 2004 87 obese adults Low-carbohydrate diet or calorie-restricted 12 months - diet Ebbeling 2003 14 obese adolescents/ Reduced glycaemic load diet compared with 6 month intensive - young adults reduced energy and reduced-fat diet phase + 6 month maintenance phase Simkin-Silver man 1998 489 women, 50% were Meetings led by behavioural psychologists 18 months - not over or underweight and nutritionists compared with control at baseline Toubro 1997 43 First randomised to rapid or slow weight-loss 12 months - programmes, then re-randomised to a fixed energy or ad lib maintenance programme338PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS iours examined, including physical activity and dietary vari- ables) showed a regression coefficient of -0.17, p value for trend 0.10.115Effect estimates in children were 0.78 (95% CI 0.60-1.02) for adolescent obesity with the highest intakegroup of fibre foods at 3 years old 206; and coeffi- cients of 0.0011 (95% CI -0.0073 to 0.0095; trend in girls and -0.0046 (95% CI -0.014 to 0.0046; p value for trend 0.320) in boys.173 Residual confounding is possible, as indicated by the max- imally adjusted cohort study above. People whose diets are high in fibre from food often also have other habits regard- ed as healthy, which may be difficult to characterise precisely. On the other hand, there is considerable evidence for a spe- cific effect of dietary fibre on satiety and on mechanismsrelating to appetite regulation, such as gastric emptying. 48 Fibre from food has a low energy density, as it is not digest- ed in the small bowel and can only undergo partial fermen- tation in the large bowel. Fibre consumption may increase satiation by increasing chewing, slowing gastric emptyingand elevating stomach distension , and stimulation of chole - cystokinin. The increased viscosity of soluble fibre can reduce the overall rate and extent of digestion , which may also result in reduced energy from protein and fat and a blunted post-prandial glycaemic and insulinaemic response to car-bohydrates. Fibre-induced delayed absorption and the resul-tant presence of macronutrients in the distal small intestine,known as the ileal brake, mediate the release of several guthormones. 207 The evidence on foods containing dietary fibre is assessed her e as a mark er for low ener gy-dense foods, although there are specific mechanisms beyond energy density. For this reason, no separate judgement ismade for dietary fibr e. 8.8.4.3 Non-starchy vegetables Five cohort studies investigated non-starchy vegetables, four in adults and one in children.114 208-211 All five cohort studies showed decr eased risk of weight gain and/or obesity for the highest gr oup of non-star chy veg- etables intak e when compar ed with the lowest, which was statistically significant in two.114 210Effect estimates in adults were 0.84 (95% CI 0.75-0.93; p value for trend < 0.0001)for becoming obese and 0.76 (95% CI 0.59-0.99; p value for trend 0.01) for major weight gain 210; -0.12 kg/m2mean change in BMI (95% CI -0.22 for regression coefficient of -0.05 (95% CI -1.24 to change BMI211; and 0.99 (95% CI 0.87-1.13) for weight gain.209Weight and height were measured in the two statistically significant studies, and wer e self -reported in the two non-significant studies. The study in children showed a statistically significant decreased risk of raised BMI z-scoresin boys (regression coefficient of -0.003, 95% CI -0.004 to -0.001) but no relationship in girls. 208 Increased consumption of non-starchy vegetables, which are generally low in ener gy density , may r esult in a com - pensatory decrease in the consumption of more energy-dense foods. Most non-starchy vegetables tend to have a low gly-caemic index and contain soluble dietar y fibr e, which mayresult in slowed gastric emptying and increased satiety. Fruits and vegetables contain high concentrations of a range of important micronutrients such as antioxidants and phyto- estrogens that may also have a beneficial influence upon theenergy homeostatic pathways. Non-starchy vegetables are assessed here as high fibre foods and as a marker for low energy-dense foods. Forthis reason, no separate judgement is made for non-starchy vegetables. Overall, the epidemiological evidence that low energy-dense foods protect against weight gain, overweight, and obesity is substantial and generallyconsistent. The mechanistic evidence, particularly thaton appetite regulation and energy balance, iscompelling. Taking all types of evidence together, lowenergy-dense foods probably protect against weight gain, overweight, and obesity. They have this effect by promoting appropriate energy intake. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two RCTs,212 213three cohort studies,179 214 215and one case-cohort study216have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (see box 3.8). 8.8.5 Energy-dense foods The Panel decided to group the epidemiological evidence on foods that ar e high in energy (box 8.1) into this general categor y. This decision was informed by the mechanistic evidence. In addition to the evidence summarised below , several of the trials reviewed in 8.8.4 investigated the effect of reduc- ing intake of energy-dense foods and drinks, which gener-ally decr eased the risk of weight gain during the intervention. The evidence on sugary drinks and 'fast foods' are also relevant to the judgement for this general category(see 8.8.6 and 8.8.7). 8.8.5.1 Animal fats Three cohort studies investigated animal fats, two in adults and one in childr en.211 217 218 All three cohort studies showed increased risk of weight gain for the highest intake group when compared to the low-est, which was statistically significant in one study , 218and in one analysis of data on children.217Regression coefficients in adults wer e 0.0032 (95% CI 0.0063-0.00006) linking ani - mal fat intak e and incr eased risk of weight gain (height and weight were self-reported)218; and 4.85 (95% CI -3.5 to 13.2; p value for trend 0.26) linking animal fat intake and weightchange (measur ed). 211The study in childr en (recording ani - mal fat intake from 1 to 7 years of age) showed a statisti- cally significant greater weight at 7 years for the highestintake group of 29.3 kg (SD\u00b12.0) compared with 23.7 kg (SD\u00b11.2) in the lowest (p value for trend < 0.05). 217When animal fat intak e was measured as g/1000 kcal, g/kg body weight, or compar ed to R oher index (weight in g /c450 100/height in cm3), no statistically significant difference was apparent. As the most ener gy-dense macr onutrient, ther e are several 339CHAPTER 8 DETERMINANTS OF WEIGHT GAIN, OVERWEIGHT, AND OBESITY plausible mechanisms by which dietary fat could lead to pos- itive energy balance and obesity. The efficiency of nutrient use is higher for fat than carbohydrate or protein. When energy balance is positive and fat is being stored, the stor-age of this fat only requires a small degree of oxidation (approximately 3 per cent of the energy stored). The high energy density of fat may promote passive overconsumption. Prolonged consumption of a high-fat diet may desensitise the individual to a number of appetite controls. The palatabili-ty of fat may induce voluntary overconsumption. The evidence on animal fats is assessed here as a marker for energy-dense foods. For this reason, noseparate judgement is made for animal fats. High energy-dense foods are probably a cause ofweight gain, overweight, and obesity, particularlywhen large portion sizes are consumed regularly. They have this effect by promoting excess energy intake. Also see entries on sugary drinks (8.8.6), 'fast foods'(8.8.7), and television viewing (8.8.8). The P anel is awar e that since the conclusion of the SLR , one cohort219and one case-control study180have been published. This new information does not change the Panel judgement (seebox 3.8). 8.8.6 Sugary drinks The evidence on sugar y drinks is reviewed separately due to its independent effect on body fatness. It also contributes to the judgement on energy-dense foods and drinks. One R CT220and four cohort studies investigated sugar y drinks.115 221-223Two cohort studies were in adults115 223; the trial and two other cohort studies were in children.221 222 The single trial included 644 childr en randomised by class to receive teaching sessions to discourage consumption of sugary, carbonated drinks or to control. After 12 months,change in BMI z-score was non-significantly lower in theintervention group, with a change of 0.7 (SD 0.2) comparedwith 0.8 (SD 0.3) in the contr ol group. 220 Three cohort studies showed incr eased risk of weight gain when fr equency of sugar y drink intake increased,115 222 223 which was statistically significant in two.115 222One study showed no association.221This study was in children, and investigated intak e of 'fruit drinks', but excluded fruit juice, soda (fizzy drinks), or diet soda. The effect estimates for the two adult studies wer e mean weight gain of 4.69 kg for 1991 to 1995 and 4.20 kg for 1995 to 1999 in women whoincreased their sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption, and 1.34 kg and 0.15 kg in women who decreased their con-sumption 223; regression coefficients of 0.20 (p value for tr end < 0.01) for the univariate model relating weight gain to increase in intake of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and 0.12(p value for trend 0.05) for the multivariable model (this study also reported a statistically significant relationship with increased waist circumference). 115The cohort study in chil - dren that r eported an effect estimate showed that BMI increased by 0.24 kg/m2(95% CI 0.10-0.30; p value for trend 0.03) per sugary drink (not including fruit juice)/dayand the effect estimate for the fr equency of obesity was 1.60(95% CI 1.14-2.24; p value for trend 0.02), also per drink/ day. 222 There is considerable variation in the definition of 'sugary drinks' between studies. The study that reported no associ-ation excluded fizzy drinks. Studies have demonstrated that, when consumed as part of a soft drink, the energy from sugars may not be compen- sated for in the same way as when consumed as part of a solid meal. 224Limited studies have shown that in adults, short-term (10-week) intake of sugar-sweetened foods and drinks (of which 80% were drinks) promoted weight gain, whilst consumption of artificially sweetened foods resulted in weight loss.28 The epidemiological and mechanistic evidence that drinks containing added sugars, including sucrose andhigh-fructose corn syrup, are a cause of weight gain, overweight, and obesity is substantial and consistent. Sugary drinks probably cause weight gain, overweight,and obesity . Like ener gy-dense foods and drinks, they have this effect by promoting excess energy intake. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, one RCT,225one cohort,226and one case-control study180have been published. This new information does not change the Paneljudgement (see box 3.8). 8.8.7 'Fast foods' The evidence on 'fast foods' is r eviewed separately due to their independent effect on body fatness. It also contributes to the judgement on ener gy-dense foods and drinks. Six cohort studies investigated 'fast foods' (see box 8.2), four in adults and two in children.165 227-231 All six cohort studies showed incr eased risk of weight gain with increased intake of 'fast foods', which was statistically significant in four,165 227 229 230and in women but not men in an additional study.231Effect estimates in adults were a regression coefficient of 0.85 (95% CI 0.43-1.27; p value fortrend in low-income women and 0.39 (95% CI 0.15-0.64; p value for tr end < 0.05) for the association between number of 'fast-food meals' per week and BMI 231; a 0.85 (95% CI 0.75-0.96) chance of maintaining weight (equivalent to a 15 per cent increased risk of weight gain)165; a weight gain of 1.72 kg (95% CI 0.52-2.92; p value for trend 0.005) greater for black people who visited 'fast-food restaurants' fr equently compared to and 1.84 kg (95% CI 0.86-2.82; p value for tr end < 0.0013) greater for the same comparison in white peo- ple230; and a 0.72 kg (95% CI 0.33-1.11; p value for trend < 0.01) gr eater weight gain for people who visited fast-food restaurants more than twice a week compared to those who visited infrequently.229One study in children showed a sta- tistically significant greater increase in BMI z-scores of 0.82 for those who ate food from quick-service outlets more than twice a week compar ed to 0.28 for those who never ate quick-ser vice foods (p value for tr end 0.0023).227One study in children stated that there was a statistically significant association between increased 'takeaway food' intake andBMI at the age of 8, but that after multivariable adjustment 340PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS there was no statistically significant relationship.228 The energy density of a food reflects the energy content per unit weight (box 8.1). Many of the highly consumed processed and 'fast foods' have a high energy density, oftendue to a high content of fat and refined starches and sugars and a correspondingly low water content. 232 The evidence that 'fast foods' as defined in the literature are a cause of weight gain, overweight, andobesity is strong and consistent. This epidemiologicalevidence reinforces the Panel's judgement on energy- dense foods. Other factors are that 'fast foods' are promoted vigorously, are cheap, and are oftenavailable in large portion sizes at low cost. 'Fast foods'probably cause weight gain, overweight, and obesity.They have this effect by promoting excess energyintake. The Panel is aware that since the conclusion of the SLR, two cohort studies226 233and one case-contr ol study180have been published. This new information does not change the Paneljudgement (see bo x 3.8). 8.8.8 Television viewing The evidence on television viewing is reviewed separately due to its independent effect on body fatness. It alsocontributes to the judgement on sedentary living (8.8.2)and may be a mark er for other behaviour, such as consumption of ener gy-dense foods (bo x 8.1). 70 One RCT234 and 16 cohort studies129 143 147 166-178investi- gated television viewing, all in childr en, adolescents, or young adults. Some studies grouped other sedentary leisure-time activities, such as playing videogames, together with televi-sion viewing. The single RCT showed a statistically significant decreased risk of body fatness with decreased television viewing. Thetrial included 198 children randomised by school into anintervention or control group for six months. The interven-tion aimed to r educe television, videotape, and videogame use with supporting lessons, encouragement not to eat mealswhilst watching television , and a seven hours per week tele - vision budget. The intervention group showed a 0.45 kg/m 2 greater decrease in BMI (95% CI -0.73 to -0.17) than the con- trol group. Statistically significant greater decreases were also seen in skinfold measurement, waist circumference, and waist to hip ratio . The inter vention group showed statisti- cally significant fewer hours of television viewing (p valuefor trend < 0.001) and fewer meals eaten in front of the tele- vision (p value for trend < 0.02). 234 Ten cohort studies showed incr eased risk of weight gain and/or obesity with increased television viewing,143 166-168 170-175 which were statistically significant in nine.143 166-168 170-174Four studies stated that there was no significant association129 176-178and an additional study found an association with videogame-playing in girls but not boys, but no associationwith television viewing. 147One study showed a non-signifi - cant decreased risk.169Effect estimates (four studies did not report effect estimates) were a regression coefficient of 0.029(p value for tr end < 0.001) for the r elationship betweenhours spent watching television and the risk of obesity (as defined by triceps skinfolds on or above the 85 thpercentile) and 0.14 (p value for trend < 0.001) for triceps skinfolds on or above the 95thpercentile174; regression coefficients of 0.037 (95% CI 0.011-0.058; p value for trend 0.001) for the relationship between time spent watching television or play- ing videogames in girls and 0.038 (95% CI 0.018-0.059; p value for trend 0.001) for the same relationship in boys173; correlation coefficient of 0.14 (95% CI 0.01-0.27; p valuefor trend < 0.05) for the relationship between time spent watching television and subscapular skinfold thickness (as a measure of body fatness) 143; a regression coefficient of 0.054 (p value for trend 0.82) for the relationship between television viewing and BMI175; a regression coefficient of 0.48 (standard error 0.19; p value for trend 0.012) for rela-tionship between television viewing in adolescence and BMIat 26 years in a maximally adjusted model 167; a regression coefficient of 0.47 (SE 0.21; p value for trend 0.02) for the relationship between television viewing and BMI166; a regres- sion coefficient of 0.19 (p value for tr end < 0.01) for the relationship between time spent watching television or play- ing videogames and BMI172; an effect estimate of 1.55 (95% CI 1.13-2.12) for the group that watched the most televi- sion when compared to the lowest.171Watching television or videos, playing computer games, or listening to audio tapeswas a positive predictor of body fat in 2 out of 4 modelsinvestigating variables related to percentage body fat at age8 years 170; a r egression coefficient of 0.05 (95% CI 0.02-0.07; p value for tr end < 0.01) for the r elationship between time spent watching television and BMI168; and a BMI of 19.5 kg/m2(95% CI 19.3-19.7) in the gr oup that watched the most television compared to a BMI of 19.6 kg/m2(95% CI 19.4-19.9) in the group that watched the least.169 Television viewing is a form of very sedentary behaviour. The epidemiological evidence is mostlyconsistent and generally free of methodological issues.Results from the intervention trial are impressive, and there is evidence of a dose-r esponse relationship. Television viewing may also be associated with consumption of energy-dense foods and drinks. Studies were of children and adolescents, but these canbe tak en to apply also to adults. Given that television viewing is a sedentary behaviour, the mechanistic evidence, particularly that on ener gy input, output, and turnover , is compelling. T elevision viewing is probably a cause of weight gain, overweight, and obesity. It has this effect by promoting an energy intake in ex cess of the r elatively low level of ener gy expenditure. 8.8.9 Other exposures The following exposures were evaluated: total fat, refined cereals (grains)/cereal products, starchy roots, tubers and plantains, fruits, fruit juices, fish, milk and dair y products, alcoholic drinks, sweeteners, and coffee. However, the data were either too low quality, too inconsistent, or the numberof studies too few to allow conclusions to be r eached. 341CHAPTER 8 DETERMINANTS OF WEIGHT GAIN, OVERWEIGHT, AND OBESITY 8.9 Comparison with previous report The panel responsible for the previous report made recom- mendations on body mass and on weight gain, based on theevidence that high body mass increases the risk of some can- cers (also see Chapter 6). The report did not review the determinants of weight gain, overweight, and obesity. 8.10 Conclusions The Panel concludes : Throughout this Report, our conclusions and judgements derive from a balance of different types of evidence, includ-ing epidemiological, clinical trial, and mechanistic data (asset out in Chapter 3). Compared to evidence on the factorsthat modify the risk of cancer, there is more and better evi- dence from clinical trials, and less from observational epi- demiology, while there is a large and robust body ofexperimental evidence in humans on mechanisms of ener gy balance. Factors that increase (or decrease) risk of weight gain do this thr ough pr omoting (or discouraging) ex cess energy intake. The interaction of energy density of diets and level of physical activity is fundamental. In light of this, we have taken an integrated approach in our interpretation of the evidence relating to weight gain,overweight, and obesity, much of which has focused on spe-cific foods, drinks, and dietar y constituents. The various foods and dietar y constituents have ther efore been inter- preted in the context of the energy density of foods and diets. The evidence showing that r egular , sustained physical activity of all types protects against weight gain, overweight, and obesity is convincing. Being breastfed is probably pro-tective. While the evidence is fr om studies of infants and young children, childhood overweight and obesity tend to track into adult life. Low energy-dense foods, especiallythose containing dietary fibre, are probably also protective . The evidence that sedentary living is a cause of weight gain, overweight, and obesity is convincing. Energy-dense foods ar e probably also a cause. Sugary drinks (those con- taining added caloric sweeteners, notably sucr ose and high- fructose corn syrup); 'fast foods' (which are readily available and may be energy dense and frequently consumed, oftenin lar ge portions); and television viewing (a sedentary behaviour associated with consumption of energy-dense foods) ar e all pr obable causes of weight gain, overweight, and obesity . The evidence reviewed in this chapter does not include the important role played by sociocultural and other environ-mental factors, which will be the subject of a further r eport to be published in late 2008. Nevertheless, given the evidence summarised in Chapter 7 on the role of body fat-ness in causing various cancers, the factors identified here should be considered to be additional, indirect causes of those cancers. 342PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Cancer survivors Cancer survivors are people who are living with adiagnosis of cancer, including those who have recovered. Awareness of cancer survival has increased greatly since the 1990s. So has the number of people living with a diagnosis of cancer. The total number ofrecorded cancer sur vivors in the world in 2002 was estimated to be just under 25 million, and by 2050 may appr oach 70 million. The term 'cancer survivor' covers a very wide variety of circumstances. Thus, the needs of peoplecurrently undergoing therapy are likely to bedifferent from those of people whose metabolicfunctions have been altered as a result of therapyand fr om those of people who are evidently fully recover ed and whose functions are intact. Nevertheless, the Panel accepts the validity of the concept of cancer sur vivor ,welcomes the rising con - sciousness that cancer is a disease best spoken ofand dealt with openly, and agrees that the best way to impr ove quality of life and incr ease the chances of prolonged life and recovery from cancer is whencancer survivors take responsibility for themselves,supported by associates, friends, and family, whilealways also consulting their professional advisorsand making best use of available medical car esys- tems and qualified social suppor t. Correspondingly, we the Panel collectively have accepted a special responsibility to give our best advice, having examined the evidence derived fromsystematic r eviews of the scientific literature done according to our agreed methodology, and also from our knowledge of the whole range of evidence and consideration of the pr ecautionar yprinciple and best clinical and public health practice. Research on food, nutrition, physical activity, and cancer sur vival is at an early stage. Overall, the Panel agrees that it is not possible to make judge- ments that apply specifically to cancer survivors, based on the evidence reviewed for this Report. Theavailable evidence on cancer survivors has a numberof limitations: it is of variable quality; it is dif ficult to interpr et; and it has not yet pr oduced any impr es- sive results. Definite general judgements are made more problematic because of differences in thehealth of cancer sur vivors at various stages;CHAPTER 9 between cancers of various sites; and between the effects of the many types of conventional and othertherapies used. The Panel notes as follows: Regular physical activity and other measures thatcontr ol body weight may help pr event r ecurrence, at least of breast cancer. In any case, when able to do so, cancer sur vivors ar elikely to gain general health benefit, and a sense of control over their circumstances, from regular physical activity. The evidence does not support the use of high- dose supplements of microconstituents as a meansof improving outcome in people with a diagnosis ofcancer .Cancer survivors should consult their physician and/or a qualified nutrition pr ofessional, who can evaluate the safety and efficacy of specificdietar ysupplements, and counsel an appr opriate action based on current research relevant to their particular clinical situation. In summar y,evidence that some aspects of food, nutrition, or physical activity specifically modify thecondition of cancer survivors is emerging, but is notyet sufficiently developed to enable the Panel tomake judgements that apply specifically to cancersurvivors, as distinct from people without cancer. 343CHAPTER 9 CANCER SURVIVORS The concept of 'cancer survivor' first gained currency in the USA in the 1990s, particularly among advocacy groupsformed to give information, advice, and support to peoplewith cancer. The term here refers to people living with a diag- nosis of cancer, including those believed to have recovered. Consciousness of cancer survival has increased greatly since the 1990s, especially in high-income countries. This is only partly because of the increase in numbers. Another rea-son is that cancer is incr easingly a disease spok en of open - ly, and seen less as the visitation of a death sentence. Cancer survivors, and their families and friends, are increasingly determined to take responsibility for living withcancer. They do this individually and collectively, usually incollaboration with their medical and surgical advisors, andoften with practitioners offering complementar yand alter- native therapies, r egimens, and advice. Cancer survivors as an overall group, together with those who ar eclosest to them, ar eespecially concerned to learn about and act on helpful recommendations. These should be least likely to do harm, and most likely to help limit theprogress of the cancer .They should also help pr event a r ecur- rence of that or another cancer, and help prevent other dis- eases, as well as improve the quality of survivors' lives. Thisplaces a special responsibility on professionals in this field,to consider carefully what can be recommended. The P anel's recommendations for cancer survivors are in Part 3, Chapter 12. 9.1 Definitions The term 'cancer survivors' denotes all people who are living with a diagnosis of cancer ,and those who have r ecovered from the disease. In this definition ,then,cancer sur vival begins at the point of diagnosis. Cancer survivors include the following population groups; these ar eoften not discr ete, because people may fall into sev - eral of the groups below. After diagnosis, before treatment People with cancer who have chosen to have treatment People with cancer who choose to have no treatment. During treatment People being treated with modern conventional therapies RadiationChemotherapy Surgery Combinations of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. People treated with therapies that are alternative or complementary to conventional ones (box 9.1), usuallyas well as, but sometimes instead of , conventional therapies Natur opathy Radical diets (very low fat, raw food, other) Energy restriction Orthomolecular nutrition (including all forms of supplementation) Gerson therapy, Hoxsey therapy, antineoplastons, Coley 's toxins, other Traditional therapies (A yurvedic, Chinese herbal, other) Combinations of these, with or without conventional therapy Other. After treatment People whose treatment has been said to be successful, and who have undamaged metabolic functions People whose treatment has been said to be successful, and who have damaged metabolic functions People who have had parts of their digestive tract surgically r emoved (mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon) As above, also with colostomy, ileostomy Other . People with secondar y cancer or cancer of a different site Where treatment has been unsuccessful, and who have undamaged metabolic functions Wher e treatment has been unsuccessful, and who have damaged metabolic functions Those who have had parts of their digestive tract surgically removed (mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon) As above, also with colostomy , ileostomy Other People with metastasised or disseminated cancer, with or without cachexia People with terminal cancer . 344PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS After recovery People who are alive 5-10 years after successful treatment People who are alive 10+ years after successful treatment (including those who had cancer as a child). The definition of 'cancer survivor' here does not include peo- ple living with a diagnosis of a benign tumour, or tumours defined as premalignant, such as premalignant cervical lesions or polyps in the colon. 'Cancer survivors' as defined here also does not include those living with people who are living with a diagnosis of can- cer. Sometimes this wider definition is used, and from the pub- lic, community, and family health points of view, issues that concern cancer survivors are also of vital importance to theirpartners, family members, and close friends. 1Such loved ones are most likely to want to know what to do, and will seek pro-fessional guidance, both for the person with diagnosed can- cer, and also for themselves and family members. This becomes most important practically when decisions need to be made about family shopping and meal pr epara - tion, and eating out. Should the family member with cancer be treated differ ently? Or should the whole family follow the same recommendations and advice? These are not questions of direct professional concern to cancer researchers, but doconcern physicians, and other health professionals, whoseresponsibility includes passing on authoritative recommen-dations, or else giving the best available advice and guidance. 9.2 Occurrence The number of cancer survivors has greatly increased in recent decades, especially in high-income countries. This ispartly because the general pr evalence of cancer continues to rise, within a world population that is also rising. In addi- tion, screening programmes for common cancers are identi-fying many more cases, usually at relatively early stages. Asalready stated, the rapid rise in the recorded incidence ofprostate cancer in recent years is largely because of increased use of methods of detection (see chapter 7.14.1). Also , for some cancers, medical and sur gical tr eatments and follow- up care are increasing the time that people live with cancer; these interventions are also improving rates of recovery. Inthe US A, estimates of the number of cancer survivors have increased from around 3 million (1.5 per cent of the popu- lation) in 1970 to over 10 million (close to 4 per cent of thepopulation) in 2002 .The absolute number of cancer sur - vivors aged 65 years and older is predicted to double in the USA by the year 2050.1 Calculations of the type made in the US A have not been made in Europe as a whole. European Union countries together now have a larger population than the USA, butgiven the overall differences between the two (somewhat lower rates of screening, detection, and years of survival after diagnosis in Eur ope), a rough guess of 5 million European survivors (or 1 per cent of the population) seems r eason - able. 2In 2002, the total number of recorded cancer survivors in the world was estimated to be just under 25 million.3 If prevalence of , and sur vival with, cancer worldwide con-tinues to increase, and follows predictions made in the USA, and given a further increasing global population, the number of recorded cancer survivors worldwide in 2025 will approach 50 million, and in 2050 will approach 70 million. Such pro-jections may be conservative, and also do not take into account people with cancer that is not diagnosed or recorded. Among cancer survivors in the USA in 2002, the most common cancer diagnosed was breast cancer among women (22 per cent), prostate cancer among men (18 per cent), andcolorectal cancer among men and women combined (10 per cent). 1These figures are not proportional to incidence rates because the average time of survival after diagnosis of dif- ferent cancers varies . In Europe, breast cancer was the most prevalent cancer in women (34 per cent), followed by colo-rectal cancer (10 per cent). In men, colorectal cancer (15per cent), prostate cancer (12 per cent), and lung cancer (10per cent) were most prevalent. 2 9.3 Interpr etation of the evidence 9.3.1 General For general considerations that may affect interpretation of the evidence, see chapters 3.3 and 3.5, and boxes 3.1, 3.2,3.6 and 3.7. 9.3.2 Specific Natur e of the field. The main pr oblem faced by reviews of cancer sur vivors, as indicated in 9.1, is the scale and het - erogeneity of the field. The interventions reviewed were studied in people with a number of differ ent cancers, at dif - ferent stages, and for different outcomes. Classification. There are many gr oups of cancer sur vivors. Some have been diagnosed but have not yet received treat- ment. Others are undergoing treatments that have damag-ing effects and which, for some, have damaged the physicalfunction of the body. Others have been overtly free from can-cer for several or many years. As yet, ther e are no general- ly agr eed classifications of cancer sur vivors, or the different stages of cancer sur vival, which mak es comparisons of stud- ies problematic. Study design. Studies should tak e into account and report the stage of treatment participants are at, and give details of this tr eatment. Studies need to have sufficient statistical power to addr ess the r esear ch question being examined. Confounding .Clinical and pathological characteristics of the cancer , such as tissue of origin , stage at diagnosis, and spe - cific molecular characteristics, are the strongest predictors of outcome, and are powerful confounding factors, especiallyin observational studies. Cancer treatments and their conse- quences may change the effects of interventions in ways that are not well understood. Different cancers may be modified in differ ent ways by food, nutrition , and physical activity . This complexity is increased by the effects of treatment and the disease itself, both of which can affect foodconsumption , digestion , absorption , and metabolism, and345CHAPTER 9 CANCER SURVIVORS also a person 's physical condition or behaviour . This is par - ticularly important for studies that relate body fatness to can- cer risk, as cancer often causes weight loss. In some cases,surgery may have been performed to remove parts of thegastrointestinal tract affected by cancer. Cancer oftenresults in loss of appetite, and cancer treatments may causenausea or a decr eased ability to absorb nutrients from food. 4 An important str ength of randomised trials, pr ovided they are sufficiently large, is that confounding variables, both known and unknown , will on average be distributed equal - ly between the treatment and control groups, and will there- fore not bias the study results (also see chapter 3.1.6). 9.4 Evidence and judgements A systematic literature review (SLR) was undertaken to assess the r ole of food, nutrition, and physical activity in the case of cancer sur vivors. This r eview addressed the efficacy of nutritional and physical activity inter ventions in cancer survivors in relation to mortality, disease-free survival, can- cer recurrence, secondary cancers, quality of life, andadverse effects of tr eatment regimens. 5 This SLR was designed differently from those on the caus- es of cancer in people assumed to be fr ee from the disease, and used as the bases for judgements in pr evious chapters. This decision was taken because the focus of the research questions was not on causation, but on the efficacy of par-ticular inter ventions. In addition , people with cancer ar e in a clinical situation and will often be receiving, or will have received, medical, surgical, or other treatments that mayaffect their nutritional status; this limits the value of some kinds of observational evidence. For these and other reasons, it was decided in the case of cancer sur vivors to give pr e-eminence to randomised con - trolled trials (RCTs), which are least likely to be confound- ed, and are best suited to investigate the relatively short-termefficacy of specific inter ventions. The r eview undertak en wasof 53 nutritional inter vention trials and 23 physical activity trials. It assessed the quality of all the studies reviewed, including the size of the study populations; the length of the interventions and of the follow-up programmes; themethods used to ensure randomisation; and the methods ofstatistical analysis. There were usually insufficient numbers of any type of study to allow useful combining of data for meta-analysis. Overall, data were also insufficient to allow for separateanalyses of sur vivors befor e, during, and after tr eatment. The Panel's standard criteria used to grade the strength of evi- dence, and the matrices used to record the Panel's judge-ments, used in pr evious chapters, wer e not used in the case of cancer survivors. A narrative review of observational studies was also con- ducted. As stated above, these are less suited in the study ofefficacy of treatments, and so in studies of cancer survivorstheir r esults should be treated with caution. Also see 9.3. The full SLR is contained on the CD included with this Report. 9.4.1 Randomised controlled trials 9.4.1.1 'Healthy' diets Food-based RCTs were defined as those using interventions that offer ed advice about 'healthy eating' (variously defined) or specific diets such as high-fibr e diets and/or weight-loss programmes. Twelve trials met the criteria for inclusion in the review of food-based interventions. Study designs tend-ed to be of poor quality , and insufficient information was available about the methods used for randomisation and blinding. Duration of interventions varied between sevenweeks and three years. Small trials conducted in Russia, the Netherlands, and Poland reported on the effects of 'healthy diet' interventions for br east cancer sur vivors, either during or after tr eatment, and cancer recurrence. A reduced fat and energy diet decreased the recurrence of breast cancer in the Russianstudy . 6A study conducted both in the Netherlands and inConventional medicine is also known as modern or Western medicine. It is allo-pathic, meaning that it relies on diagnosis of disease, by examinations and tests, and treatment. With cancer, treatment includessurgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Conventional medicine is based on investi- gation of the biology (including anatomy,physiology, and biochemistry) of body organs, tissues, and cells. It includes an understanding of the pathological pro-cesses that lead to disease, and testing of interventions for efficacy and safety. Conventional practitioners undergo exter-nally validated and structured education and training programmes, and continuing professional development, and they aresubject to statutory regulation. Complementary and alternative medi- cine includes many diverse medical andhealthcare systems, practices, and products \u2014 some traditional, some modern. Training and regulation of providers exist, but often vary between therapies and nations. Some orthodox scientific evidence is avail- able regarding some of these therapies,although the efficacy of many remains unclear and often controversial. These therapies include mind-body interventions, such as meditation; biologi- cally based treatments, such and herbal products; manipula- such as massage and osteopathy; 'energytherapies', such as the use of magnets ortherapeutic touch; and alternative medical systems, such as traditional Chinese andAyurvedic medicine. 'Integrative medicine' is a recent approach that uses some complementaryand alternative therapies within conven- tional medicine. Physical activity pro- grammes and dietary interventions arecommonly used in integrative medicine, together with counselling. Cancer survivors should consult their physician or qualified health professional before initiating any therapies that are alternative or complementary to conven-tional therapies. Cancer survivors should keep all of the health professionals involved in providing any treatment fully informedof their choices in these areas.Box 9.1 Conventional and unconventional therapies 346PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Poland examined the effect of dietary advice and psycho- logical support to achieve weight loss, but no significant effect on breast cancer recurrence was reported, perhapsbecause of the small size and limited power of the study . 7 Six trials reported on the effect of 'healthy diets' on 'quality of life'. Of these, one study of people sur viving br east, ovar y, prostate, or testicular cancers showed a positive effect, in a pro- gramme that combined general dietary information with phys-ical training and coping skills. 8A study of people surviving head and neck or gastrointestinal cancers showed a beneficial effectwith a programme of dietary counselling compared to usualcare. 9The other studies r eported no effect.10-13 Only one trial investigated food-based inter ventions and side-effects of treatment. This study found that individual nutritional advice, adapted to the patient's own needs and tastes, reduced adverse effects from radiotherapy in people with head and neck cancers.14 Three small trials examined food-based inter ventions and all-cause mortality. The studies were conducted in survivors of non-melanoma skin cancer,15colorectal or lung cancer,16 and breast, ovary, prostate, or testicular cancer.8None of the trials reported a significant association between the inter-vention and all-cause mortality . No conclusions can be derived fr om these r esults. The Panel is aware of two large, multicentre, randomised tri- als of br east cancer survivors, the WINS study, published in 2006, and the WHEL study, published in 2007. The WINS trial tested a dietary intervention to r educe fat intak e in over 2000 women with early stage br east cancer . After 5 years of follow- up, the women in the intervention group had a 24 per cent reduced risk of recurrence compared with the control group (rel-ative risk 0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.98). 17However , these findings cannot be easily translated into recommendations for breast cancer survivors, for several reasons. First, women in the inter-vention group had more extensive surgical procedures. Also, they lost weight during the trial and it is possible that weight loss was r esponsible for their improved outcome. Finally, dietary fat r eduction was most beneficial in women with oestr o- gen- or progesterone-receptor negative tumours, a finding that may be due to chance. 18 The WHEL study tested the effect of a dietary intervention highin vegetables, fruits, and dietary fibre, and low in fat, in over 3000 women with early stage breast cancer. After 7.3 years of follow- up, there was no difference in breast cancer recurrence, new breast cancer, or all-cause mortality between the intervention and con-trol groups. 19Unlike the WINS study, in the WHEL study women in both the intervention group and the control group experienced small increases in weight, and this may partially account for the different results in these two trials. 9.4.1.2 Supplements Data from 39 RCTs were assessed. The review included tri- als on supplements of retinol,20-26beta-carotene,27-30vitamin each of evening primrose oil,41glutamine,42and N-acetyl- cysteine26and nine trials of commercial supplements were reviewed.43-51 Also see box 9.2. Trial quality and number of participants tended to be higher in supplement trials than in the dietary-interventiontrials. Compliance was monitor ed in the majority of trials, and placebos were usually given to the control group. However , the contr ols in all seven r etinol trials and in five of the nine commercial supplement interventions were given 'usual treatment' or an 'unrestricted' diet. There was considerable variation in the methods and length and type of intervention used, and the overall quali-ty of many studies was poor. Furthermore, the disparate vit-amins and other bioactive substances used in these studiesmake comparison difficult. R esults were null or non-signifi- cant in almost all cases. Trials wher e data wer e sufficient and the exposur es were homogeneous enough to allow meta-analysis included those examining retinol and all-cause or cancer mortality.Comparing the inter vention to usual tr eatment, the summar y estimate from four trials that examined all-cause mortality was 0.97 (95% CI 0.83-1.13) 23-26; from three trials that examined cancer mortality, the summary estimate was 0.92(95% CI 0.65-1.31). 23 24 26 One small trial of bladder cancer sur vivors showed a sig- nificant r eduction in cancer r ecurrence. This trial compared supplementation with a multivitamin plus a high-dosecombination of vitamins A, B6, C, and E and zinc against a multivitamin alone. 33 A larger trial designed to test the effect of 200 micrograms per day of selenium supplementation on recurrent non- melanoma skin cancer showed no effect on skin cancer , but a protective effect on pr ostate cancer .36 37 Fifteen trials investigated types of supplementation and side-effects of cancer treatment. One small study reportedhigher tr eatment to xicity in sur vivors of haematological can - A supplementation (as retinol or beta- carotene). 23No significant results were reported in the other studies.27 29 31 32 34 35 38-40 48 56-58 The evidence fr om this review of trials does not show that micr onutrient supplements have any benefits in cancer survivors. High-dose supplements may be harmful. Some micronutrients and other bioactivecompounds ar e known to be to xic at high doses. In the USA and in other high-income countries, the use of supple- ments in physiological (low dose) and also pharmacological (high dose) amounts is common among the general population andalso among cancer survivors. At least 50 per cent of the US population take vitamin and min- eral supplements. 52Supplement use among US cancer survivors has been shown in two studies published in 2004 to be similar to the average, but high-dose supplements may be more commonlyused by cancer survivors. 53 54Survivors are also reported to be high users of complementary and alternative medicines and other treatments.55Several hundred web sites promote high-dose sup- plements with unsupported claims that they are active cancer cures or can prevent recurrence. Box 9.2 Use of supplements by cancer survivors347CHAPTER 9 CANCER SURVIVORS 9.4.1.3 Physical activity Twenty-three physical activity RCTs met the criteria for inclu- sion in the review. Interventions ranged from simple advice to increase physical activity, to enrolment in supervised exer-cise programmes. These were mostly small trials and of short duration. In half of the studies, compliance levels were unclear, and the majority failed to record physical activity levels in the control group, which severely limits their value. Only three of the physical activity intervention trials reported on mortality or cancer recurrence. 8 59 60None of these studies reported significant effects. Twenty trials investigated quality of life outcomes with phys- ical activity interventions. Nine of these trials were in survivors of haematological cancer,61lung cancer,62prostate cancer,63 and in a combination of cancers.8 12 64-68. Eleven trials were in breast cancer survivors.62-73Two of the interventions in these trials included nutrition components.12 64 The physical activity interventions, assessment instru- ments, and outcomes studied were varied. The interventionsincluded many types of super vised or home-based ex ercise programmes. Several studies assessed well-being and qual- ity of life using a version of the F unctional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale, 69although other questionnaires and scales were also used. Quality of life outcomes included arange of measures of physical, functional, and emotionalwell-being, as well as measures of physical fitness. Of the 20 physical activity trials that investigated quality of life, 18 r eported a benefit from the intervention on at least one of the outcome measur es reported in the study. None of the trials reported harmful effects of the physical activity interventions on any of the outcomes studied. Taken together, these trials provide some evidence for the benefit of physical activity on post-tr eatment quality of life in cancer survivors. 9.4.2 Observational data Three reviews that examined data from 26 observational cohort or case-contr ol studies met the criteria for inclusion in the r eview of obser vational data.70-72 All of these compar ed br east cancer outcomes in cancer survivors to 'body fatness', as measured by body mass index (BMI) (see chapter 6.1). The results of these studies weregenerally consistent. An overall incr eased risk of mortality with increasing BMI was reported, although there was some heter ogeneity in study r esults. Of 21 studies that followed cases for at least 5 years, 12 showed statistically significant associations between higher BMI and worse outcome, while others showed insignificantresults or wer e null. One study found that mortality risk decreased as BMI increased. Physical activity was associat- ed with an enhanced quality of life in cancer survivors. While this information suggests that higher body fatness befor e diagnosis leads to a worse outcome, and also that physical activity may be beneficial in br east cancer survivors, it is nevertheless insufficient to justify any firm judgement on body fatness specificallyin relation to cancer survivors.The Panel is aware of two large observational studies that investigated physical activity in breast cancer survivors. A study of nearly 3000 breast cancer survivors in the Nurses' Health Study reported reduced risk of breast cancer mortality inwomen who were physically active, compared with sedentary women. 73In a second study of over 1200 women, physical activity measured before diagnosis of breast cancer was asso- ciated with reduced all-cause mortality; this association was statistically significant in women who were overweight or obeseat diagnosis .74 9.5 Comparison with the previous report The previous report did not include any review, assessment, or recommendations directed at cancer survivors. The panelresponsible for that report stated that its recommendations were especially important for population groups and people most susceptible to cancer. 9.6 Conclusions The Panel concludes : Research into the effects of food, nutrition, and physicalactivity in cancer survivors is in its early stages. For this rea-son, and also because of the scale and heterogeneity of thefield, the evidence r eviewed here is inconclusive. Regular physical activity and other measur es that control weight may help prevent recurrence of breast cancer and improve quality of life. When able to do so , cancer sur vivors may gain general health benefit and a sense of control over their circumstances from regular physical activity. The evidence does not support the use of high-dose supplements of microconstituents as a means of improvingoutcomes in people with a diagnosis of cancer. Cancer survivors should consult their physician and/or a qualified nutrition professional who can evaluate the safetyand efficacy of specific dietar y supplements, and offer advice based on curr ent research relevant to their particular clini- cal situation . As with all the chapters in Part 2 of this Report, the Panel's recommendations for cancer survivors are in Part 3,Chapter 12. 348PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Findings of other reports The assessments and judgements made by the Panel shown in the preceding chapters are based onevidence from systematic literature reviews oforiginal research studies, compiled according to specified criteria, on food, nutrition, physical activity, and the risk of cancer. However, the Panelrecognises that r ecommendations on food, nutrition, and physical activity are also made in relation to other diseases. These include r ecommendations designed to control and prevent chronic diseasesother than cancer, and those designed to influencethe dietary and activity patterns of populations andindividuals. Recommendations that addressnutritional adequacy (prevention of deficiencies),and pr evention and management of infectious diseases (vulnerability to which is af fected by nutritional status) should also be taken into account. The Panel has ther eforedecided that its recommendations designed to control and preventthe incidence of cancer, made in the followingchapters, should take into account the judgementsand recommendations of authoritative reportsrelated to the prevention and control of otherdiseases. Any potential conflicts that might arisebetween its own recommendations and others thatcover the same aspects of food, nutrition, andphysical activity ar eidentified in this chapter . As stated in its title, the pr esent Repor thas a global perspective. The importance of dietary issues related to chronic diseases, relative to those fornutritional adequacy and infectious diseases, variesboth between countries and betweensubpopulations within countries. The appr oach taken by this Repor t, to consider r ecommendations fr om other reports, is particularly relevant for those parts of the world now suffering the 'double burden' of endemic deficiencies and infection \u2014 especially of infancy and childhood \u2014 as well as increasing incidence of cancers of various sites, and of other chronic diseases. Nevertheless, people, as well aspublic health authorities, need integrated messages.In Chapter 12 we state whether any r ecommendation is affected as a r esult of the findings of other such reports. This chapter has also assembled the findings of other r ecent r epor ts on food, nutrition, physicalCHAPTER 10 activity, and cancer. These show where judgements and recommendations are consistent, and wherethey have changed, as science has developed and asviews on relative weight of evidence from different types of research have evolved. In addition, comparisons have been made in Chapters 4 to 7between the findings of this Repor tand the pr evious report, published in 1997. 349CHAPTER 10 FINDINGS OF OTHER REPORTS Dietary guidelines produced by expert bodies have been part of national and international public health nutrition policiessince the early 20th century. At first, the recommendeddietary intakes for the planning of food supplies were designed to prevent specific nutritional deficiencies. From the 1960s, a different type of guidance began to emerge,designed to pr event food and nutrition-r elated chr onic diseases, including heart disease and cancer. Aprevious r eview analysed the findings of 100 expert reports published between 1961 and 1991 that include guidelines and recommendations to prevent various chron-ic diseases. 1Some of the landmark reports produced over this period are 'The Causes of Cancer',2'The US Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health',3'Nutritional Goals for Health in Latin America',4'Medical Aspects of Dietar y Fibre' published by the Royal College of Physicians of London,5and 'Diet and Health' and 'Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer 'published by the US National R esear ch Council.67 Towards the end of this 30-year period, dietary guidelines to prevent chronic diseases tended to move the emphasisaway fr omdietar yconstituents (such as saturated fat or vit - amins). Instead, the focus shifted to foods and drinks, and sometimes to dietary patterns as a whole. The 1961-1991 review 1shows consistent agreement on the types of diet recommended to protect against obesity, car-diovascular disease (CVD), cancer of a number of sites, disor countries, are high in wholegrain or minimally processedcereals (grains), vegetables and fruits, and are therefore high in dietary fibre and bioactive microconstituents, relatively high in fish, and contain lean meat. These r ecommended diets ar ealso corr espondingly low in total fat and saturated fatty acids, sugars, and salt; fatty and salty foods; sugary foods and drinks in general; and alcoholic drinks. The reviewalso shows that the expert r eports consistently r ecommend regular, sustained, physical activity. However, almost without exception, expert reports on chronic diseases treated these issues independently to those of nutritional adequacy (and the prevention of nutritional deficiencies), or of the pr evention and management of infec- tious diseases, notably of infancy and childhood, and viceversa. The separate consideration of these issues usually reflected the focus either on national concerns in high-income societies, or the specific inter ests of specialists. 10.1 Method This chapter is based on a systematic review of secondary literature that examines recommendations for dietary and physical activity produced since 1990 for the prevention of anumber of diseases. Therefore, this chapter carries forward the work of the 1961-1991 r eview .The purpose is to give an account of the recommendations of other reports and not to assess the evidence ther ein.The full systematic literatur e review is contained on the CD included with this Report. 10.1.1 Diseases and exposures The diseases in this present review are categorised as nutri- tional deficiencies, infectious diseases, chronic diseases otherthan cancer ,and cancer. These are diseases identified by the United Nations and other authoritative bodies as being causally linked with food, nutrition, and physical activity.They ar ealso identified as significant contributors to the global burden of preventable disease in terms of prevalence and cost. The 'exposur es' cover ed in this r eview ar ethose identified in the report that preceded this one 8as convincing or prob- able modifiers of cancer risk \u2014 together with those judgedby other reports to justify a recommendation designed to pre-vent or control other diseases. The reports analysed includerecommendations on relevant foods and drinks (including food pr oduction ,preservation, processing, and preparation), and dietar yconstituents, physical activity ,and energy balance. 10.1.2 Reports reviewed The reports reviewed were published between 1990 and 31 December 2004 in the English language. T obe included in the r eview ,reports needed to : Involve an expert panel Include an original review of relevant literature Include explicit disease-specific conclusions and recommendations Base their conclusions on published peer-reviewedliterature specified as a bibliography. This appr oach eliminated reports that simply restated pre- vious r ecommendations. It also ensur ed that the r eview included only reports with the main aim of developing or updating nutrition-related recommendations. Reports commissioned by industr y,business-inter est organisations, or 350PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS other interested parties were excluded. The criteria used for and timing of this review meant that some important reports were not included. The Panel is aware of these exclusions and has supplemented the text where such an omission would have given an incomplete picture. Of more than 10000 documents identified initially by data- base searches, applying these criteria reduced the number to 207. All of these reports were read and 94 were included in the review: 16 reports from international organ-isations, 8-2339 from North from the European 2from India,99 100and 1 report from South Africa.101The recommendations in the 113 that were finally excluded are generally consistent with those in the included reports. The Panel is aware that other important reports have been published, which were either published subsequent to thereview for this chapter or did not meet the criteria for inclu- sion. The organisations that produced these reports are: the American Cancer Society, 102the International Agency for Resear ch on Cancer ,103the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence,104and the US Department of Health and Human Ser vices and the Department of Agricultur e,105and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization.106 106BThe recommendations from these reports were also taken into consideration during theformulation of the recommendations for this Report. 10.2 Interpr etation of the data Some caution is needed when interpr eting the information presented here. Most of the reports included have been com- missioned by and for high-income countries and so reflectthe nutrition concerns of such countries. Pr oducing these reports is expensive and is likely to be beyond the means of most individual middle- and low-income countries. Where arecommendation is made for diets high in vegetables andfruits, for example, this means high in relation to the dietstypical of high-income countries. Meeting such r ecommen- dations might mean incr eases in intak ein some countries and maintaining alr eady high intak es in others. Recommend- ations for vegetables and fruits usually do not include pota- toes, which are generally grouped with roots and tubers (seechapter 4.1.1). Many of these reports are concerned with what are now pandemic diseases of the cir culator ysystem (ischaemic heart and cer ebrovascular diseases and their determinants such as obesity, high levels of blood fats, and high blood pressure). Fewer reports are concerned specifically with cancer or dis-eases of other systems of the body ,although an incr easing number now link obesity with type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Only a minority of the reports reviewed attempt to be com- prehensive, and the terms of reference of these reports may be limited. For example, of the 15 reports addressing can- cer,just 4 are concerned solely with cancers in general. Of the rest, 4 focus on chr onic diseases including cancer ,2are concerned only with colorectal cancer, 2 with vitamin sup- plementation, 1 with oral health, 1 with children's health,and 1 with fats and oils. Also ,some r eports on cancer do notreview alcohol, food additives and contaminants, or breast- feeding. For such reasons, most reports say nothing about many of the aspects of food, nutrition, and physical activity addressed in this Report. The summary below states wherethere is significant disagreement between reports. The Panel decided not to include a tabulated summary of the recom- mendations from reports on cancer because, in view of our own Report, this would be non-contributory. Until recently, few reports have used a systematic approach to assess the prevention of nutritional deficiencies in gener- al. Although it has been established that vulnerability to infectious diseases \u2014 especially of infancy and childhood \u2014 is crucially affected by nutritional status, only in the past few years has there been an extensive analysis and a coherentapproach to the recognition of the role of individual micronu-trients such as vitamin A, zinc, and selenium in reducing life-threatening infections, for example, of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which continue to exact a huge bur- den of disability and premature death. Many r eports concerned with food, nutrition ,and physi - cal activity also stress the importance of not smoking or using tobacco .This information is not included her e. 10.3 Nutritional deficiencies 10.3.1 Background Undernutrition and hunger r emain common in parts of the world wher epopulations ar eimpoverished and food is inse- cure, largely for social (including political and economic) and envir onmental r easons. Global rates of malnutrition (inade - quate energy intake) and micronutrient deficiencies remain high, especially in low-income countries. Many diseases ar ecaused by deficiencies of specific or combined essential nutrients. These diseases, when severe and prolonged, can be fatal. In the 1990s, relevant UN agen-cies specified that certain micronutrient deficiencies were themost important global public health problems. 107 108Those identified included deficiencies of ir on (causing anaemia, las- situde, and learning difficulties), iodine (causing goitr eand cretinism), and vitamin A (causing x erophthalmia, impaired night vision, and eventually blindness). Infants, young children, and pregnant and lactating women have been ,and remain, the main focus of recom- mendations designed to prevent and control nutritional deficiencies. R ecommendations for combating specific defi - ciencies include pr ogrammes of salt iodisation (iodine); con - sumption of foods containing readily absorbable iron, including meat and other foods of animal origin (iron); andconsumption of foods high in car otenoids or r etinol (vitamin A). Supplementation and fortification are also recommend- ed. 107 108Other recommendations continue to promote exclu- sive breastfeeding, as well as the supply of adequate and varied weaning foods (preferably indigenous or local), and water and food fr ee from infectious agents. Anumber of trials and systematic analyses have assessed the value of interventions with micronutrients. The results are sometimes different when tested in African, Asian, orLatin American childr en,and this pr obably reflects the351CHAPTER 10 FINDINGS OF OTHER REPORTS different prevailing nutritional conditions. The results emphasise the importance of ensuring that micronutrient intakes are adequate and that dietary factors that enhance micronutrient status form an important part of the diet ofboth children and adults, with particular attention being paid to women before and during pregnancy. 10.3.2 Introduction Few reports concerning nutritional deficiencies qualified for inclusion in this review. Of the 95 included, 2 make recom- mendations on preventing rickets,28 524on preventing iron deficiency anaemia,11 13 51 92and 4 on preventing vitamin A deficiency.14 19 21 79These reports come from 10 different organisations: 1 from Europe, 6 from international agencies,and 3 from North America. No reports were included whoserecommendations relate to malnutrition in general, or toiodine deficiency. 10.3.3 Foods and drinks Vegetables, fr uits, pulses (legumes), nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices. Three reports recommended that various vegetables and fruits \u2014 being those high in vitamin C and folates \u2014 should be included with meals to boost iron absorption and hence prevent iron deficiency anaemia. 11 13 51Another report recommended that the com- plementary diets of infants and young children should includevegetables and fruits high in vitamin A to prevent vitamin Adeficiency . 21 Meat, fish, and eggs. One report recommended including foods that ar ehigh in absorbable ir on,such as lean meat, to prevent iron deficiency anaemia.51 Dietar yconstituents and supplements. For vitamin C, folic acid, and iron, see chapter 4.10. Also, one report recom- mended that after the age of 6 months, infants receivingbreastmilk or cow's milk as their main drink, or those con-suming less than 500 ml/day of infant or follow-on formu-la, should r eceive a vitamin A supplement to prevent vitamin Adeficiency . 79Two reports include recommendations for vit- amin A ,14 19and two r ecommended vitamin Dto prevent rickets.28 52 Breastfeeding. One r eport recommended that mothers should breastfeed exclusively for the first 4-6 months of their child's life to pr event ir on deficiency in the child.19 10.3.4 Comparison of reports One difference in emphasis between these reports and those on cancer (and other r eports not included in the r eview) is the stress given to the importance of extended, exclusive breastfeeding (see 10.4.3), and the importance of safe watersupplies. Differences in recommendations for supplementation of diets of infants and young childr en are not substantial. An appar ent differ ence between these r eports, and those on cancer and other chronic diseases, is the recommenda- tion to consume meat as a source of absorbable iron to pre-vent anaemia. However ,only modest amounts ar eproposed, and reports on cancer and other chronic diseases do not recommend diets without red meat. The Panel agrees that these matters of emphasis and considerations should be taken into account in itsrecommendations. See Chapter 12. Also see the Panel's conclusions in 10.7. 10.4 Infectious diseases 10.4.1 Background Vulnerability to a number of common infectious diseases is affected by nutritional status; this is especially important in infants and young children.109Interaction between nutrition and infection occurs with 'classic' malnutrition \u2014 inadequateenergy from food \u2014 and also with deficiencies of a range ofvitamins and minerals. Relevant diseases include diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory infections, measles, whooping cough, and chickenpox. 109On a global basis, rates of dangerous infectious diseases \u2014 especially of infancy and childhood \u2014 remain high, particularly in low-income countries. Con-versely ,repeated infections impair nutritional status, particularly during childhood. The usual recommendations in previous reports concern- ing food, nutrition, and infectious diseases of infants andyoung children have been for exclusive breastfeeding, ade-quate and varied weaning foods (preferably indigenous orlocal), and water and food supplies fr ee from infectious agents. 107 10.4.2 Introduction Few reports concerned with infections qualified for inclusion in the review. Of the 95 reports accepted, 3 included rec-ommendations for the pr evention or management of diar - rhoea, 10 17 913for the management of HIV and AIDS,912 25 1for the management of measles,85and 1 for respiratory dis- eases.91These 7 reports were published by 6 organisations: 2from Australasia, 3 from international agencies, and 1 from North America. No r eports were found that make dietary recommendations to help pr event or manage dysentery, malaria, or tuber culosis. 10.4.3 Foods and drinks Cereals (grains), roots, tubers, and plantains. One r eport recommended that people with HIV or AIDS should include staple foods with ever ymeal.9This r eport specified r efined starchy foods such as white rice, maize meals, white br ead, noodles, and potatoes to avoid gastric aggravation.9 Vegetables, fr uits, pulses (legumes), nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices .One report recommended that people with HIV or AIDS should eat a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, andpulses (legumes) every day. 9 Meat, fish, and eggs. One r eport recommended that people with HIV or AIDS should eat meat, poultr y,and fish regularly.9It advised that meat should be cooked thoroughly, and foods containing raw eggs avoided, to prevent diarr hoea. 9352PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Milk and dairy products. One report recommended that people with HIV or AIDS should consume milk products regularly.9 Fats and oils. One report recommended that people with HIV or AIDS should include fats and oils in their diet to maintain their weight.9 Salt and sugar. One report recommended that people with HIV or AIDS should include sugar and sugary foods in their diet to maintain their weight.9 Water, fruit juices, soft drinks, and hot drinks. One report recommended that people with HIV or AIDS should drinkplenty of clean and safe water. If in doubt, and during anepisode of diarrhoea, water should be boiled before use, andcoffee and tea avoided. 9 Food production, processing, preservation, and prepara- tion. Also see 10.5.3. T wo reports made r ecommendations on preventing diarrhoea: contaminated food and drink should be avoided; clean utensils should be used during preparation and serving; and food should be stored safely and served immediately after preparation.1017One of these reports also recommended that foods should be covered andrefrigerated where possible, for the same reason. 17Similarly, another report recommended storing fresh food and leftoversin a cool place or a r efrigerator. 9Two reports recommended that foods should be cook ed thor oughly and leftovers reheat- ed to a high temperature to prevent diarrhoea.917 Dietary constituents and supplements. One report rec- ommended that some people with measles should receivevitamin A supplements. 85 Breastfeeding. Three reports recommended that women should breastfeed exclusively for the first 4-6 months of theirchild's life to prevent the child having diarrhoea. 10 17 91Of these, one further advised non-ex clusive breastfeeding up to 2years of age and beyond if possible.17Another r eport made the same r ecommendation to pr event respiratory disease in the infant.91Two reports recommended that women infect- ed with HIV should avoid breastfeeding where possible toprevent transmission of the virus to their child, and should cease breastfeeding as soon as is feasible. 12 25One report recommended that clean ,nutritious weaning foods should be intr oduced to an infant at 4-6 months of age, beginning initially with soft mashed foods to prevent the child having diarrhoea.17 10.4.4 Physical activity One report recommended that people with HIV or AIDS should take light exercise.9 10.4.5 Comparison of reports As with r eports on nutritional deficiencies, one differ ence in emphasis between these reports and those on cancer is the stress given to the importance of extended, exclusive breast-feeding and the importance of safe water supplies. The Panel agrees that these matters of emphasis should be taken into account in its recommendations. On the impor- tant issue of mothers with HIV or AIDS, the Panel endorses the position of the WHO that 'exclusive breastfeeding is rec- ommended for HIV-infected women for the first 6 months of life unless replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe for them and their infants before that time'. Also see Chapter 12. Many of the specific recommendations to protect against deficiencies and infections in these reports (and others) are inharmony with those designed to prevent chronic diseases; few are inconsistent. On salt and the prevention of goitre, and meat/iron and the prevention of deficiency, and the pro- motion of physical and mental health, see 10.5.7. The recommendations made by the Panel in Chapter 12, when these take into account prevention of nutritional defi-ciencies and infectious diseases, are based additionally on the expert judgement of Panel members experienced in these areas. Many such reports were excluded by the criteria forinclusion for systematic r eview .These usually emphasise the need for food security \u2014 the constant availability of ade- quate, appr opriate, and nourishing food. This fundamental priority does not contradict the findings of reports concerned with chronic diseases. Similarly, reports concerned withdeficiencies and infections, especially of infancy and child-hood, emphasise the need for safe water (and safe watersupply and reliable sewage systems). This also does notcontradict the findings of r eports concerned with chronic diseases. 10.5 Chronic diseases other than cancer 10.5.1 Backgr ound In general, chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as some cancers,appear to have been uncommon, even in older people, untilrecent history. With urbanisation and industrialisation, theyhave become mor eprevalent, even among younger people. It is now generally accepted that the main causes of chr on- ic diseases ar eenvir onmental factors, including inappropri- ate food and nutrition, and physical inactivity. Expert reports concerning the impact of unbalanced food and nutrition on the risk of chr onic diseases began to appear in the 1970s. 110At first, these were concerned mostly with coronaryheart disease (CHD), which had become the most common cause of total and pr ematur emortality in various high-income countries. Later reports began to consider other chronic diseases, or chronic diseases in general. For exam-ple, a r eport published by WHO in 1990 consider ed that a number of diseases could be prevented by appropriate food and nutrition. These include cerebrovascular disease, CHD,dental caries, type 2 diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, various cancers, and various gut disorders. 111 Forty-two reports published mostly in high-income coun- tries between 1973 and 1988 wer ereviewed in 1990.111 These made recommendations for reducing the risk of chron- ic diseases. They proposed that changes in consumption ofcertain foods and drinks wer ecausing the rise in chr onic 353CHAPTER 10 FINDINGS OF OTHER REPORTS diseases, as was physical inactivity. They identified foods and drinks relatively concentrated in total fat and saturated fatty acids, sugar and salt, and alcohol, as well as diets low in rel- atively unprocessed grains and other starchy foods, vegeta-bles and fruits, and dietary fibre. Later reports noted that obesity and type 2 diabetes in particular were becoming more common in middle-income countries, and that these diseases were no longer 'diseases of affluence'. More or less the same dietary recommendations were made for the prevention of all of these chronic diseases, including cancer. 1For high-income countries, this has been summarised as diets with: 'moderately low levels of fat, with special emphasis on restriction of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol; high levels of complex carbohydrates; only mod-erate levels of protein, especially animal protein; and onlylow levels of added sugars'. 7 Global population average nutrient goals for the preven- tion of chronic diseases were published by WHO in 1990 as follows: total fats 15-30 per cent, saturated fats 0-10 percent, and polyunsaturated fatty acids 3-7 per cent of energy of total 27-40 g/day; and dietary protein 10-15 per cent oftotal energy intake. 111 10.5.2 Introduction This section pr esents the recommendations made since 1990 on chr onic diseases other than cancer .Of the 95 reports reviewed, 60 made recommendations relating to the pre- vention of obesity ,type 2 diabetes, or CVD. These wer epro- duced by 34 different organisations: 6 from Australasia, 10 from Europe, 2 from India, 2 from international agencies, 13from North America, and 1 fr om South Africa. Of these, 33 discussed the prevention of CVD in general, 16 22 30 32 34 36 37 39-47 57 61-63 68 69 71 72 77 78 80 84 91 92 94 97 9824 the prevention of CHD,822 24 26 30 35 36 53 62 64 66 73 75 81 88 91-93 95-97 99-10114 the prevention of type 2 diabetes,22 30 31 45 53 57 62 69 76 77 88 89 91 92 8theprevention of dyslipidaemia,16 30 53 57 77 87 91 9816 the prevention of hypertension ,16 22 30 34 36 44 46 56 57 62 69 71 88 91 92 9812 the pr evention of over weight/obesity,816 18 22 27 53 62 69 76 91 92 98and 11 the prevention of stroke,30 36 38 40 42 62 70 77 88 91 111Nine reports included recommendations to prevent osteopor osis22 23 33 48 58 59 88 91 92and 10 to pr event dental caries.22 49 50 52 53 65 69 74 91 92Two reports referred to the prevention of sk eletal disorders in general30 82and 3 to the prevention of dental diseases in general.62 79 88 These have been produced by 16 different organisations: 1 from Australasia, 4 from Europe, 1 from an international agency,and 10 fr om North America. Some 5 r eports made r ecom - mendations to prevent gut diseases and disorders, produced by 4 organisations: 2 from Australasia, 1 from Europe, and1from North America. Of these, 3 referred to the prevention of constipation, 960 912tothe prevention of diverticular disease,91 r egarding found in 4 reports,79 86 91 92of which 1 was concerned with lactose intolerance88and 1 with coeliac disease.9210.5.3 Foods and drinks Cereals (grains), roots, tubers, and plantains. Fourteen reports recommended including wholegrain cereals in the diet.16 18 24 36 40 41 43 66 70 78 91 92 95 98 Four of these recommended that people should consume 3-6 servings per day to prevent CVD,36 40 78 98and those at risk of CVD should eat 6-12 serv- ings per day.98Three recommended that people should limit their intake of refined carbohydrates, particularly from cere- als (grains).3641 98 Vegetables, fruits, pulses (legumes), nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices. Sixteen reports recommended consuming rela- tively high amounts of vegetables and fruits22 35 36 40 69 70 73 75 77 78 80 91 92 95 98 100 with 13 recommending at least 400 g per day (at least 5 servings).2235 36 40 69 73 75 77 78 83 95 98 100 Eleven reports recommended the consumption of pulses (legumes).16 22 24 36 37 41 43 70 88 91 98 Meat, fish, and eggs. Eight reports recommended that con- sumption of r ed meat should be moderated and lean meat preferred (unspecified amount).16 24 40 41 66 78 98 101 Seven reports r ecommended including fish in the diet.1624 41 43 66 80 91Nine reports recommended consuming oily fish.22 39 40 72 7880 91 93 98Eleven reports recommended that people should consume 1-3 servings of fish a week.22 30 39 40 70 72 78 83 93 96 98 Two reports recommended that egg consumption should be limited.16 98 Fats and oils. Twenty-five r eports recommended that total dietary fat intake should be limited.822 24 26 34 35 46 53 56 62 64 69 70 77 78 80 84 87 89 91 94 98-101Thirty-thr ee reports r ecommended that intake of saturated fatty acids should be limited.816 22 24 26 30 31 34-36 40 41 43 53 56 62 63 66 69 70 76-78 80 88 89 91 94 95 98-101Three reports r ecommended that dietar yfat intak eshould not be restricted in children under 2 years of age.26 41 83Seven reports recommended moderate intake of polyunsaturated fattyacid. 24 30 35 66 70 80 93One report recommended that if total fat intake is restricted, people who are inactive and overweightshould still include some polyunsaturated fatty acids in theirdiet to pr event CHD. 98One r eport r ecommended that n-6 fatty 5-8 cent of ener gy intak eto pre- vent stroke,70while another suggested they should form 4-8 per cent to prevent CVD.69One report recommended that to prevent CHD, linoleic acid should make up no more than 10 per cent of total energy, at a ratio of between 5:1 and 10:1 with alpha-linolenic acid.8Five reports recommended the consumption of n-3 fatty acids.70 72 80 91 93 Two reports r ec- ommended that eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid should be included the diet.23 39Nine mended r estricting intak eof acids.2230 36 40 41 43 69 83 98Three reports recommended restricting the combined intake of trans -and saturated fatty acids.93 97 98Four reports recommended limiting the intake of hydrogenated, vegetable, and partially hydrogenated fats.24 62 66 91Three reports rec- ommended r estricting myristic acid intake (including coconut products).66 91 101 Salt and sugar. Twenty reports recommended that salt intak eshould be limited to no mor ethan 6 g/day for 354PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS adults,1630 35 36 40 41 44 46 56 62 63 69-71 73 80 88 91 98 100while anoth- er recommended that people should consume less than 5g/day.22Ten reports recommended that people should limit their sodium intake.30 40 41 44 46 56 59 66 80 88 Seven reports rec- ommended that consumption of sugary foods should be lim- ited,36 41 62 69 91 92 98with six specifying the prevention of dental disease.2262 65 74 79 92Four of these reports made this recommendation only in relation to dental disease.2265 74 79 Ten reports recommended that the proportion of energy in the diet from sugar should be limited (either total, added, ornon-milk extrinsic sugars).36 41 53 62 73 87 91 92 98 101 Milk and dairy products. Eleven reports recommended that low-fat dairy products should be chosen in preference tohigh-fat versions. 1624 36 40 41 46 56 66 83 98 101 Water, fruit juices, soft drinks, and hot drinks. Three reports recommended that water should be chosen as a drink to prevent overweight/obesity and dental damage.22 65 92One report r ecommended that individuals (particularly older peo - ple) should consume between 1.5 and 2 litres of water each day to pr event constipation .60One r eport r ecommended that people with HIV or AIDS should drink plenty of fluids to pre- vent constipation.9Three reports recommended that people should limit their consumption of sugary drinks to preventdental damage. 2265 92 Three reports recommended against using sugary drinks in babies' bottles to prevent dental dam-age. 49 65 92Tworecommended that people should limit their caffeine intak eto no mor ethan four cups of coffee per day to prevent osteoporosis.4859One report recommended that caffeine should be eliminated to pr event constipation .60 Alcoholic drinks.

Eight reports rec- ommended that carbohydrates should provide between 45 and 65 per cent of total ener gy intake as part of a healthy diet.24 53 63 64 69 80 87 99 Three reports r ecommended including complex carbohydrates in the diet.16 87 99Fifteen reports rec- ommended a diet relatively high in dietary fibre.916 35 36 40 41 53 60 63 64 69 70 95 98 101Sixteen r ecommended r estricting dietar ycholesterol intake.816 24 26 30 35 36 40 43 62 63 66 70 78 80 93Thirteen reports recommended that 'at risk' groups, and also people with type 2 diabetes, should limit dietary cholesterol to less than 200 mg/day to prevent CVD.30 34-36 40 41 43 44 46 63 64 99 101 These groups of people include those at risk of or with pre- existing CVD, or those with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Two reports recommended that there should be no restriction of dietary cholesterol for children under 2 years of age.2680One report recommend- ed that more than 400 micrograms/day of folate should be consumed to prevent CVD.98Three reports recommended the consumption of vitamin D to prevent osteoporosis,22 48 59and another made this recommendation for preventing skeletal disorders in general.82One report recommended that chil- dren with inflammatory bowel disease should have at least400 international units (IU) of vitamin D per day to preventosteoporosis. 58Another report recommended that vitamin D intakes for people with gastrointestinal diseases should be 800 IU/day to prevent osteoporosis.33 Various reports rec- ommended that people should ensur ethat they have an ade - quate intake of calcium,16 22 30 33 46 48 58 59 70 82potassium,22 46 5680and magnesium.4670Three recommended that people should brush their teeth with a fluoride toothpaste to pre- vent dental damage.5065 74With regard to supplements, one report recommended against the use of antioxidant supple-ments to prevent CVD, 43while two recommended against beta-carotene supplements.61 73One report recommended against using vitamin E supplements to pr event CHD,61 73and another to pr event CVD.47 Breastfeeding. One r eport r ecommended that women should breastfeed to prevent dyslipidaemia in the infant.87 Two gave this advice as a means of preventing over- weight/obesity in the infant,27 92and one of these specified exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months.92Four reports recom- mended that women should breastfeed exclusively for 6months to prevent food intolerance in the infant, 27 79 91 92of which two made this recommendation to prevent Crohn's as a way of r educing the risk or delaying the onset of coeliac disease92in the infant. 10.5.4 Physical activity Twenty-four reports recommended that people should undertake at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physi- cal activity on most days of the week.16 22 30 33-36 40 43 45 56 57 62 64 68 69 73 76 78 80 89 96 97 101 One of these r ecommended 60 min - utes/day of moderate, or 30 minutes/day of vigorous activ- ity,69while two reports recommended 60 minutes/day of moderate activity .22 53Three reports r ecommended that chil - dren and adolescents should perform 60 minutes of activity on most days of the week.16 41 62Seventeen reports recom- mended that people should be physically active for general good health and to prevent chronic diseases.916 23 27 30 34 40- 42 59 62 64 75 77 82 88 91 Two reports recommended that weight- bearing activity should be included to pr event sk eletal disorders including osteoporosis.59 82Four reports recom- mended that people, especially children, should limitsedentar yactivities. 27 41 62 82 355CHAPTER 10 FINDINGS OF OTHER REPORTS 10.5.5 Growth, development, body composition Two reports recommended that people should avoid being underweight to prevent skeletal disorders, including osteoporosis.23 82 10.5.6 Weight gain, overweight, obesity Fifteen reports recommended that a body mass index (BMI) of less than 25 is healthy.3536 38 40 41 43 46 56 62 69 80 91 96 98 101Eight of these reports specified a BMI range of 18.5-24.9.3538 40 43 46 56 62 91Two reports recommended a BMI range of 18.5-23 for Asian people.99 100Twelve reports recommended that peo- ple should achieve and maintain a healthy weight.16 18 23 34 41 46 62 69 82 91 98 111Six reports recommended that people should lose weight if they have a BMI of 25 or above.34 40 44 46 77 78 One report recommended that people who are overweight or obese should lose 5-10 kg to prevent CHD.73One recom- mended that overweight people at risk of type 2 diabetes should lose 5-10 per cent of their bodyweight to prevent this disease.31Nine reports recommended that men maintain a waist cir cumfer ence of no mor ethan 40 inches (102 cm) and women no more than 35 inches (89 cm).34-36 40 43 44 78 89 98Two recommended that Asian men should have a waist to hip ratio of not more than 0.88; for Asian women this should not exceed 0.85.99100Three reports recommended that people should limit their intake of energy-dense foods.36 62 89 10.5.7 Comparison of reports Thereis one significant difference between the reports that focus specifically on cancer (see 10.6) and those concerned with chronic diseases other than cancer. The discussion in anumber of these r eports noted the evident pr otective effect of modest alcohol consumption against CHD (but not cere- brovascular disease or other chronic diseases). However, noreport included in this r eview explicitly r ecommended the consumption of alcoholic drinks. There are some significant differences \u2014 at least in empha- sis \u2014 between reports that make recommendations to pre-vent chronic diseases other than cancer, and those that makerecommendations for preventing cancer specifically. Reports concerned with pr eventing chr onic diseases other than to the impor- tance of diets high in cereals (grains) \u2014 preferably wholegrain or minimally processed \u2014 as well as diets highin vegetables, fruits, and fish. High-fat milk and dair yprod- ucts are judged to increase the risk of CVD, but these foods arenot thought to be a major factor in the development of cancer . The iodisation of salt supplies, which is necessary to prevent goitre, need not be in conflict with recommendations on max-imum levels of salt intak e. Recommendations to limit con - sumption of red meat need not conflict with recommendations for iron intake to prevent clinical and subclinical deficiency,and to promote physical and mental development. The Panel agrees that these differences and considerations be tak en into account in its recommendations which, when they ar ebased partly on findings on diseases other than can - cer, are clearly identified as such. See Chapter 12. In general, the Panel notes the impressive consistency of find- ings appar ent fr om a systematic r eview of expert reports pub-lished since 1990 on food, nutrition, physical activity, and the prevention of chronic diseases, which reinforce the findings of earlier, less formally conducted work. The main evidence- based recommendations made by expert reports on cancer,and by reports on chronic diseases other than cancer, are mostly harmonious and often practically identical. This in- cludes reports on obesity, type 2 diabetes, CVD, and disorders of the digestive system, osteoporosis, and dental diseases. 10.6 Cancer 10.6.1 Background Throughout recorded history, cancer has been attributed \u2014 at least in part \u2014 to food and nutrition, as well as to otherenvironmental factors. Until the beginning of the 20thcentury, high consumption of meat and salt, and low consumption of bulky plant foods, vegetables, and fruits were thought to increase the risk of cancer in general. In thefirst two thir ds of the 20th centur y,aseries of laborator yand ecological studies found that energy restriction protected against cancer in laborator yanimals, and that diets low in fibre and high in meat, fat, salt, salty foods, and/or alcoholic drinks seemed to increase the risk of some cancers inparticular. 15 From the late 1970s, reports began to be published that summarised the scientific literature on food, nutrition, andcancer ,and provided dietary recommendations for the pre- vention of cancer .Between 1977 and 1989, 12 such r eports were published in, or for, Canada (1), Europe (2), Japan (1), Latin America (1), and US A(7). These r eports have been reviewed previously. 1They tended to recommend relatively high consumption of cereals (grains), vegetables, and fruits(and so of dietar yfibreand micr onutrients); r elatively low consumption of red meat, and smoked and cured meats; low consumption of salted and salty foods; low or no consump-tion of alcoholic drinks; maintenance of a healthy bodyweight; and regular physical activity. 10.6.2 Introduction Following this work, this section pr esents the recommenda- tions made for controlling and preventing cancer since 1990. The order of the passages below follows that of the contentsof the pr esent Report. Overall, of the 95 reports reviewed, 15 include recommendations on preventing cancer. These reports have been pr oduced by 12 different organisations: 1 from A ustralasia, 3 fr om Eur ope, 5 in or for North America, and 3 from international agencies. There are no such reports from middle- or low-income countries. Of the 15 reports, 12present r ecommendations r elating to the pr evention of can- cer in general 815 22 29 47 61 62 67 83 88 91 92and 11 of these also make recommendations on preventing site-specific cancers.These include cancers of the bladder (3) 15 88 91;breast (7)15 29 62 67 88 91 92;2for cervix, endometrium, larynx, liver, nasophar stomach15 67;colon and ectum 20 29 62 67 90-92;lung (3)15 47 67;mouth/phar - ynx and recom- mendations summarised in this section (10.6) are forpreventing cancer in general, unless stated other wise. 356PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Table 10.1 Recommendations to prevent food-related diseases The table below summarises recommendations from reports published since 1991 for the management, control, and prevention of chronic diseases, nutritional deficiencies, and relevant infectious diseases. Recommendations related to cancer are not included here. Unless indicated otherwise, there is no disagreement between reports. To present the findings of the review more easily, recommendations have only been included if they are made in three or more reports. However, the Panel does not intend this as a measure of the quality of the recommendations themselves. For more detailed information, please refer to the appropriate sections in this chapter.

EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS 10.6.3 Foods and drinks Cereals (grains), roots, tubers, and plantains. Six reports recommended diets high in cereals (grains),1520 29 some emphasising relatively unprocessed grains. One rec-ommended g/day a of cereals (grains), pulses (legumes), roots, tubers, and plantains, stating that this is based more on the evidence for other chronic diseases. 15 Vegetables, fruits, pulses (legumes), nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices. Nine reports recommended diets relatively high in vegetables and fruits,15 20 22 29 65 67 83 90 91with five speci- fying five or more portions a day.15 22 29 67 83One report rec- ommended the consumption of five portions of vegetablesand two portions of fruits each day. 91Four reports recom- mended diets relatively high in pulses (legumes).15 29 88 91 Meat, fish, and eggs. Five reports recommended limiting red meat15 20 22 29 83;two of these advised opting for lean varieties.2229Three reports r ecommended that meat should be baked, grilled (broiled), or poached rather than fried or flame grilled (charbr oiled).1522 29One r ecommended minimal intake of smoked meats.15Four recommended choosing poultry15202229and fish.1520 22 29One recommend- ed limiting Cantonese-style fermented salted fish.22 Fats and oils. Three reports recommended limiting total fat intak e: upper limits vary between 15 and 30 per cent,15 25 and 30 per cent,15 90and 30 and 35 per cent.8Two rec- ommended restricting saturated fatty acid intake to 10 per cent or less of total ener gy intak e.867One r another limiting linoleic acid.53 Salt and sugar .Two reports r ecommended that consumption of salt, salty, and salted foods should be limited to a total intake of less than 6 g of salt/day.15 22Two reports recom- mended limiting sugars and refined carbohydrates.15 29One of these advised limiting sugars to less than 10 per cent oftotal ener gy intake. 15 Water,fruit juices, soft drinks, and hot drinks. One r eport recommended drinking plenty of water to prevent cancers of the colon and rectum and bladder.91Two reports recom- mended limiting sugars and syrups fr om sources such as soft drinks.15 29Another recommended avoiding very hot and scalding drinks.22 Alcoholic drinks. Six reports recommended limiting alco- holic drinks.15 22 29 62 91 92When an amount was specified, this was usually a maximum of 1-2 drinks per day . Food production, processing, preservation, and prepara- tion. (Also see meat, fish, and eggs.) Two reports recom- mended avoiding contaminants (in particular aflatoxins and mycoto xins).1522One of these r ecommended that perishable foods should be r efrigerated.15 Dietary constituents and supplements. One report recommended diets high in dietar yfibre/non-starch poly-saccharides.83Another recommended 1000-1200 mg/day of calcium to prevent colorectal cancer.90Two stated that dietary supplements are unnecessary and possibly even harmful.15 83 10.6.4 Physical activity Ten reports recommended regular, sustained physical activ- ity.1520 22 29 62 67 83 88 90 91Those that specify the intensity and duration, recommend moderate physical activity for around30-60 minutes per day. 10.6.5 Growth, development, body composition One report recommended that women should breastfeed exclusively to prevent them from developing breast cancer\u2014ideally until the child is 6 months old. 91 10.6.6 Weight gain, overweight, obesity Five reports recommended maintaining a BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9.15 29 67 83 91One of these advised that people should not gain mor ethan 5 kg during their adult life.15One report recommended avoiding energy-dense foods.29 10.6.7 Comparison of reports There is no substantial disagreement between any of these reports. The Panel also notes the general consistency with its own findings and recommendations. 10.7 Conclusions The P anel concludes: We are impressed by the similarity of the conclusions and rec- ommendations in all types of expert report reviewed here.For reports that r ecommended diets high in cer eals (grains) (preferably relatively unrefined), and in vegetables and fruits, and pulses (legumes), no conflicting recommendationswere found. These reports also include recommendations fordiets low in red and processed meats; and correspondinglyhigh in dietar yfibre and micronutrients, including bioactive microconstituents; and low in fats, saturated fatty acids, added sugars, salt, and alcoholic drinks. We are also impressed by the consistency between reports on deficiencies and infections that stress the vital importanceofextended, ex clusive breastfeeding for the sake of the child; and reports on chronic diseases that make the same recom- mendation ,for the sak eof both children and mothers. We arealso impr essed by the agr eement of the r eports on the benefits of all forms of regular, sustained physical activity, and the corresponding risks of sedentary ways of life.Evidence on micr onutrient supplements is less clear .We consider this largely reflects the clinical needs of populations vulnerable to deficiencies. 360PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS Research issues The evidence of causal relationships between food, nutrition, physical activity, body composition, andcancer is and always will be incomplete. Newmethods of research, and new issues to study, are always being developed. However, this ongoing work does not mean that the response to everyquestion is 'mor eresear ch is needed'. The pr evious chapters in this Report show that in many areas, the evidence of causal r elationships is alr eady str ong enough to justify public health goals and personal recommendations, which are specified in Chapter 12.This chapter outlines future strategic researchdirections that the Panel sees as especially promisingto build on this current base of knowledge. In many ar eas, as shown in the matrices introducing each section of Chapter 7, the evidence may be suggestive but inconclusive. These particularareas ar ethose in which new ef forts to answer research questions may be most likely to result in findings that can advance scientific knowledge orchange public health practice. The r esear ch dir ections identified here are often cross-cutting and interdisciplinary. These could increase understandingof the cancer process, and provide new evidence toclarify and strengthen the recommendations made inChapter 12. Therearealso many fields of study that are only now beginning to be explor ed. These include exposures in early life including before birth that affect birth weight, growth in childhood, age atmenar che, and attained adult height. They also include interactions between food and nutrition and other factors, notably smoking, inflammation, andinfectious agents. Ther eis as yet r elatively little epidemiological research on broad patterns of diets, and the inter-relationship between elements of diets: mor eunderstanding her ewill enable recommendations to be made with increasing confidence. More needs to be known about the levels of exposure that are critical as modifiers of cancer risk,and the extent to which risk is decr eased or increased at dif ferent levels. In some ar eas, understanding will be improved by general agreement on the nature and definition ofexposur es; examples include physical activity ,CHAPTER 11 processed meat, and breastfeeding. Until recently, epidemiological and experimental research studies were typically carried outseparately, and with different objectives. But to be convincing, epidemiological evidence, however consistent, needs to be supported by concreteevidence of biological mechanisms. A pr omising development is an increased tendency forepidemiologists and basic scientists to work as teammembers, to mutual benefit. Future research shouldencourage this. One broad category of research, not reviewed for this Report, concerns the underlying social(including economic and political) and broadenvir onmental determinants of patterns of food, nutrition, and physical activity .This ar ea is also critical to the successful translation of the knowledge of the causes of cancer into impr oved health. This crucially important aspect of research iscontained in a separate report dedicated to thistopic to be published in late 2008. 361CHAPTER 11 RESEARCH ISSUES 11.1 Principles The principles applied when identifying the research questions specified here are as follows: Interdisciplinary The r esear ch dir ections discussed her eare focused not on issues that are specific to separate disciplines, such as epidemiology or cancer biology ,but on inter disciplinar y issues and questions that concern the relationships between cancer and food, nutrition, physical activity, andobesity. Important The benefit of conducting mor eresearch where the evidence is alr eady convincing and well understood is likely to be small. Research that investigates areas where the evidence is unclear is lik ely to be of especial value. Research is also of most value when the results have a large potential impact on the overall burden of disease.This may be because the exposur eunder consideration has apotentially profound effect on cancer risk or because the cancer site in question is particularly common. Innovative Research questions need to be practical and yet innovative, which implies that they should not be constrained byconventional wisdom. Mor einnovative r esearch is needed. Investigators should be imaginative and collaborate across disciplines, and be willing to engage in researchprogrammes most likely to benefit public health. 11.2 Research issues How can the evidence for specific nutritional or physical activity exposures in relation to cancer be strengthened? Exposur es judged 'pr obable' or 'limited \u2014 suggestive' in the matrices of this Report are most promising as a focus of further r esear ch when evidence is scant. Examples of such exposures include calcium and dairy products as related to cancer of the prostate; vitamin D and cancer ofthe colon; folate and cancers of the oesophagus,pancreas, and colorectum; and selenium and cancers ofthe lung, colorectum, and prostate. Those already judgedconvincing, by their ver ynature, are less likely to be influenced by new r esear ch. Also, people are increasingly using non-traditional therapies, and these should also be atopic for mor esystematic r esear ch. Study design options include pooling of prospective data (especially for rarer cancers), longer follow-up ofexisting cohorts, investigations with biomark er measurements of intake and biomarker endpoints, and new randomised controlled trials (RCTs). For exposures where strong evidence exists of a causal relationship, what ar ethe effect sizes with respect to timing, dose, and duration of exposur e? The evidence currently available for various exposures and cancer risk is limited in terms of timing, dose, duration, and size of effect. This kind of evidence is important for healthcar eproviders and policy-makers to makeinformed decisions on public health pr ogrammes, and for people to make better-informed choices. Study design options include pooling of prospective data (especially for less common cancers), longer follow- up of existing cohorts, and obtaining more information on early life dietary exposures. This research directionapplies to a number of the questions addressed in this Report. For example, more information on timing, dose, and duration of exposur eis needed on the effects of body size and fatness at differ ent times of life in r elation to future risk of breast cancer and colorectal cancer; the effects of timing, dose, and duration of use of alcohol andbreast cancer risk; and detailed dose-r esponse Resear ch findings continue to accumulate. This evidence needs to be identified, analysed, and interpreted. The World Cancer Research Fund International, together with the AmericanInstitute for Cancer Research, the organisations responsible forcommissioning this Report, have now commissioned a processof continuous updating of the literatur e. This will be the basis for periodic updates of this Report's findings. The process willcontinue to make use of systematic literature reviews and is being overseen by an inter national exper tsteering gr oup, including members of the Panel r esponsible for this Repor t.Box 11.1 Updating the evidence362PART 2 EVIDENCE AND JUDGEMENTS information on red meat and processed meat in relation to colorectal and other cancers. How do environmental and genetic factors modify the effects of exposures on cancer risk? Further investigation into the presence of effect modification is needed to deepen understanding of riskamong different population groups and to help health professionals and policy-makers provide more precise recommendations. Factors that should be studied as potential effect modifiers include tobacco, exogenous hormones, medications (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), metabolising genes, genesassociated with various cancers, and other food,nutrition, and body composition exposures. What mechanisms link foods and drinks, dietary constituents, or other nutritional and physical activityfactors to cancer risk? There is general agreement that nutritional factors, body composition, and physical activity are importantdeterminants of cancer risk. However, it has been difficultto identify with confidence the precise pathways wherebysuch exposur es influence the process of cancer development. Inevitably ,the impact of nutrition will ultimately be at the level of DNA and gene expression, but the ways in which this occurs, either via genetic mutation or epigenetic events, is only now beginning to be explored. There are many nutritional factors for whichepidemiological data suggest that a r elationship exists, but where complete understanding of the biological pathways is lacking. Examples include adiposity, physicalactivity, height, red meat, processed meat, vegetables,alcoholic drinks, lactation, products, andwhole grains. Dietar yconstituents that ar eespecially favourable to this type of mechanistic investigation include beta-carotene, calcium, vitamin D, folate, selenium, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and dietary fibre. Intermediatebiological mechanisms potentially r elevant to mechanistic understanding include inflammation, insulin resistance, growth factors, o xidation, gut flora, hormonal changes, and various cellular metabolic and molecular pr ocesses. Such mechanisms may vary by the histopathological and molecular characteristics of the tumours. Intermediatemark ers may clarify questions of causation and ser ve as surrogate endpoints for observational and intervention studies. Study designs that may be useful to examine these questions include human metabolic studies with cancer- related endpoints and metabolic studies added onto existing nutrient R CTs. Intermediate endpoints should be incorporated into large, prospective, observational or intervention studies to better understand their links toboth nutritional factors and cancer endpoints.Increasingly with greater understanding of the interplay of nutritional state and genetic expression, programmes of study that incorporate elements of different disciplines and technologies should illuminate the fundamentalprocesses underpinning diet-cancer links. Which genetic polymorphisms and nutritional exposures that influence gene expression are useful forunderstanding the relationship between nutrition or physical activity and cancer? Certain genetic polymorphisms (genetic variants that appear in at least 1 per cent of the population) mayincrease, while others may decrease, the extent to whichnutritional factors affect cancer risk. Studyinggene-nutrient interactions is likely to yield better results as technology allows the simultaneous examination of multiple gene-nutrient interactions, and as bettersystems evolve for synthesising the lar ge amounts of data that are generated by these newer techniques. Genetic mak eup can impact the extent to which our bodies respond to nutritional factors. Also, genes express themselves (or switch on) to varying degrees dependingon the nutritional environment. Understanding the extentto which nutrients affect gene expression in such a way asto impact on both cancer risk itself and thenutrient/cancer risk r elationship is very important. Examples of gene-nutrient interactions include N- acetyl transferase and meat. In certain cases, geneticpolymorphisms (for example, MTHFR 677 T Tfor low folate intake and LCT \u2014 lactase persistence \u2014 for dairy food intake) can act as proxies for nutritional exposures.This can be examined using a Mendelian randomisationstudy design, controlling for confounding factors. Forexample, the effects of folate may be demonstrated bylooking at the differences in cancer outcome betweenpeople who have the MTHFR gene variant that mimicslow folate intak e(MTHFR 677 TT) and people who do not. Carr ying this form of the gene is unlik ely to be related to other potential confounding factors such as smoking or socioeconomic status. Does weight loss in overweight or obese people reduce cancer risk? Body fatness and weight gain increase the risk of several cancers. But the effects of weight loss on cancer risk arepoorly understood. Study design options for investigating this question include model systems with caloric restriction and weight loss, human metabolic studies withintermediate endpoints, and cohort studies with explicit inquiries about intentional weight loss. What are the relevant milestones in the timing of growth and development that affect cancer risk and how canthey be modified by food, nutrition, and physical activity?363CHAPTER 11 RESEARCH ISSUES Critical periods for exposure to factors that lead to increased cancer risk during the life course should be identified. For example, high birth weight and rapid growth in height during adolescence are both associatedwith an increased risk of breast cancer. Some countries have extensive child and adolescent growth data that can beexamined in relation to cancer outcomes using registries. How can factors related to food production, processing, preservation, and cooking methods, which may affect cancer risk, best be studied in humans? Current methods used to produce food are changing faster than at any other point in history. It is most important tounderstand how old and new methods might affect the risk of cancer. In addition to changes in agricultural practices, both rapid urbanisation and economicglobalisation have transformed food systems. Methods used to evaluate the changes in cancer risk that might betied to these new patterns need to be developed. R elevant factors may include exogenous hormone administration in the production of meat, production of heterocyclic aminesand polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by high-temperaturecooking, use of food additives, use of pesticides, novelprocessing methods, and storage conditions. How do food, nutrition, body composition, and physical activity affect outcomes in cancer survivors? The extent to which cancer survivors are similar to or differ ent fr om people without cancer ,in terms of the extent to which their cancer risk is sensitive to changes in diet, body composition, and physical activity, needs to beinvestigated. Anumber of further questions arise: Are any effects of food, nutrition, and physical activity additive? Arethe type and the progression of the cancer important in this regard? Is the extent to which cancer survivors have hadexposur etochemotherapeutic or radiological treatment important? Therearetwo br oad contexts for these questions: do diet, nutrition, or physical activity before diagnosis affect outcome after treatment? And do changes in these afterdiagnosis and tr eatment affect outcome? Inaddition to RCTs among survivors, existing cohort studies can examine some of these questions since thereare now fairly large numbers of cancer survivors in some cohorts. Pooling of the data from these studies could be valuable. Good information on clinical-pathologicalfactors and tr eatments is necessar yin obser vational studies because these potentially confounding factors affect cancer prognosis and may be related to nutritionalexposur es. How do relationships between food, nutrition, and physical activity and cancer risk differ in various parts of the world? In areas of the world where patterns of cancer and patterns of diet are different, the relationship between nutrition and cancer risk can also vary. For example, in middle- and low-income countries, the inverse relation between body mass and premenopausal breast cancer isusually not seen. It could be that there are factors such as genes, body composition, or physical activity that modify the effect of body mass on cancer risk in some populations. How can measures of food, nutrition, physical activity, and body composition, as they relate to cancer risk, be improved? Better ways of characterising and measuring the short- and long-term exposures most relevant to determiningcancer risk ar eneeded. These may include incorporating new instruments in prospective studies, whether internet- based or telephone-based recalls, dietary records, with, ifpossible, strong validation studies using biomarkers. Also,additional development of intake biomarkers, wherefeasible, and their incorporation in large prospectivestudies would be helpful. Finally ,expanded investigation of dietary indexes and patterns, which have the potential to capture the effect of multiple, inter connected dietar yfactors, may further enhance our understanding of nutrition and cancer.\u0013,iV\u009c\u0093\u0093i\u0098`>\u00cc\u0088\u009c\u0098\u00c3 H[SHUW\u0003VHFWLRQV\u000312\u0003&217(17\u0011LQGG\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0016 \u001a\u0012\u001b\u0012\u0013\u001a\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0014\u001a \u0015\u0014 \u0015 Part 3 Chapter 12 Public health goals and personal recommendations 368366The culmination of the five-year process resulting in this Report is Chapter 12, in which the Panel's public health goals and personal recommendations are specified. These are preceded by a statement of the principles that have guidedthe Panel in its thinking. The goals and recommendations are based on judgements made by the Panel in Part 2, as shown in the introductory matrices. Such judgements are of a 'convincing' or 'probable' causal effect, either of decreased or increased risk. Judgements of 'convincing' or 'pr obable' generally justify goals and recommendations. These are proposed as the basis for public policies and forpersonal choices that, if ef fectively implemented, will be expected to r educe the incidence of cancer for people, families, and communities. Eight general and two special goals and recommendations are specified. In each case a general recommendation is followed by public health goals and personalrecommendations, together with footnotes when further explanation orclarification is r equired. These are all shown in boxed text. The accompanying text includes a summar y of the evidence; justification of the goals and recommendations; and guidance on how to achieve them. Reliable judgements are carefully derived from good evidence. But specific public health and personal goals and recommendations do not automaticallyfollow fr om the evidence, however str ong and consistent. The pr ocess of moving from evidence to judgements and to recommendations has been one of the Panel's main responsibilities, and has involved much discussion and debate untilfinal agreement has been reached. The goals and recommendations here havebeen unanimously agreed. Food, nutrition, body composition, and physical activity also af fect the risk of diseases other than cancer . Infor med by the findings of other reports summarised in Chapter 10, the goals and recommendations have therefore been agreed with an awareness of their wider public health implications. The goals and recommendations are followed by the Panel's conclusions on the dietar y patter ns most likely to protect against cancer. As conventionally under taken, epidemiological and experimental studies ar e usually sharply focused. In order to discern the 'big picture' of healthy and protective diets, it is necessary to integrate a vast amount of detailed information. This also has been part of the Panel' s task. The main focus of this Report is on nutritional and other biological and associated factors that modify the risk of cancer. The Panel is aware that, as with other diseases, the risk of cancer is critically influenced by social, cultural,economic, and ecological factors. Thus the foods and drinks that people consumeare not pur ely because of personal choice; often oppor tunities to access adequate food or to undertake physical activity can be constrained, either for reasons of ill health or geography, economics, or equally powerfully, by culture.PART 3RECOMMENDATIONSIntroduction to Part 3367There is a limit to what can be achieved by individuals, families, communities, and health professionals. Identifying not only the nutritional and associated factors that affect the risk of cancer but also the deeper factors enables a wider range of policyrecommendations and options to be identified. This is the subject of a separatereport to be published in late 2008. The members of the Panel and supporting secretariat, and the executives of the WCRF global network r esponsible for commissioning this Repor t, have been constantly reminded of the importance of their work during its five-year duration. The public health goals and personal r ecommendations of the Panel that follow are offered as a significant contribution towards the prevention andcontrol of cancer throughout the world. 368PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS This Report is concerned with food, nutrition, physical activity, body composition, and theprevention of cancer, worldwide. Chapter 12 is theculmination of the Report. It explains the principles that guide the Panel's decisions; lists and explains the Panel's recommendations to prevent cancer; andidentifies appr opriate dietar y patter ns. The recommendations are in the form of a series of general statements; public health goals designed tobe used by health professionals; andrecommendations for people \u2014 as communities,families, and individuals \u2014 who can also be guidedby the goals. Footnotes are included when neededfor further explanation or clarity. Most cancer is pr eventable. The risk of cancers is often influenced by inherited factors. Never theless, it is generally agreed that the two main ways toreduce the risk of cancer ar e achievable by most well informed people, if they have the necessary resources. These are not to smoke tobacco and toavoid exposur e to tobacco smoke; and to consume healthy diets and be physically active, and tomaintain a healthy weight. Other factors, inparticular infectious agents, and also radiation,industrial chemicals, and medication, affect the riskof some cancers. The Panel notes that pr evious r eports have attributed roughly one third of the world's cancer burden to smoking and exposure to tobacco, androughly another one third to a combination of inappropriate food and nutrition, physical inactivity , and over weight and obesity. By their natur e, these estimates ar e appr oximations, but the Panel judges that avoidance of tobacco in any form, together with appropriate food and nutrition, physical activity , and body composition, have the potential over time to reduce much and perhaps most of the global burden of cancer. This is in the context of general current trends towardsdecreased physical activity and increased bodyfatness, and pr ojections of an increasing and ageing global population. The recommendations here are derived from the evidence summarised and judged in Part 2 of thisRepor t. They have also taken into account r elevantdietary and associated recommendations made in other reports commissioned by United Nationsagencies and other authoritative international andnational organisations, designed to promote nutritional adequacy and prevent cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. They thereforecontribute to diets that ar e generally pr otective, and that also provide adequate energy and nutrients. The r ecommendations can ther efore be the basis for policies, programmes, and choices that should prevent cancer, and also protect againstdeficiency diseases, infections especially of earlylife, and other chronic diseases. Throughout its work, the Panel has also been conscious that enjoyment of food and drink is acentral par t of family and social life, and that food systems that generate adequate, varied, anddelicious diets ar e one central par t of human civilisation. From the cultural and culinary, as well as the nutritional point of view, therecommendations her e amount to diets similar to cuisines already well established and enjoyed inmany parts of the world. Public health goals and personal recommendationsCHAPTER 12369CHAPTER 12 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS activity is most appropriate and enjoyable depends on indi- vidual abilities and preferences, as well as the settings inwhich populations, communities, families, and individualslive. The Panel has taken the same approach in considering the recommendations altogether. As a whole, the recommen-dations contribute to whole diets and overall levels of phys - ical activity most likely to prevent cancer. This does not imply one particular diet, or a specific form of physical activ - ity, but rather key elements designed to be incorporated into existing and traditional diets and ways of life around theworld. This is emphasised in section 12.3 of this chapter, onpatterns of food, nutrition, and physical activity. 12.1.3 Global This R eport has a global perspective. It is ther efore appro- priate that the recommendations here are for people and populations all over the world; that they apply to people irrespective of their state of health or their susceptibility to cancer; and that they include cancer survivors. Some factors that modify the risk of cancer ar e mor e com - mon, and so of more concern, in some parts of the world than others. It is possible that such factors might becomemore widespread, but the recommendations on them in thisReport are in the context of their current local importance. Just as people's susceptibility to cancer varies, so will the extent to which they will benefit fr om following these r ec- ommendations, though most people can expect to benefitto some extent from each of them. Recommendations for whole populations are usually now identified as also being of importance for people who , while not being clinically symptomatic, have known risk factors for disease. P eople at higher risk of various cancers include smok ers and people r egularly exposed to tobacco smok e; people infected with specific overweight and obese sedentary people; people with highintak es of alcoholic drinks; people who ar e immunosup - pressed; and those with a family history of cancer. Such peo- ple are often at higher risk of diseases other than cancer. The Panel agrees that the recommendations here apply to these people. They also apply to cancer sur vivors, meaning people liv- ing with a diagnosis of cancer , including those identified as having recovered from cancer (see Chapter 9). This is sub- ject to important qualifications, stated in the special rec-ommendations for this gr oup of people. The recommendations presented in this chapter are designed as the basis for policies, programmes, andpersonal choices to reduce the incidence of cancer ingeneral. These are guided by a number of separate principles and also by one overall principle, which is, that taken together, the recommendations provide anintegrated appr oach to establishing healthy patterns of diet and physical activity, and healthy ways of life. In or der to be useful both for health pr ofessionals who advise on cancer, and for people who are interested in reducing their own risk of cancer, the recommendationsare quantified wherever possible and appropriate. See box 12.1. 12.1.1 Integrated The Panel, in making its recommendations, has been con- cerned to ensur e that most people in most situations throughout the world will be able to follow its advice. The recommendations are framed to emphasise aspects of foodand nutrition , physical activity , and body composition that protect against cancer. They are also integrated with exist- ing advice on promoting healthy ways of life, such as thatto prevent other diseases. At the same time, the Panel hasgiven special attention to making recommendations that canform the basis for rational policies, effective pr ogrammes, and healthy personal choices. 12.1.2 Broad based In assessing the evidence, making its judgements, and in framing its r ecommendations, the Panel has, where appro- priate, chosen to take a broad view. It has also agreed to base its advice on foods and whole diets rather than on specificnutrients. Thus, r ecommendations 4 and 5 concern plant foods and animal foods in general, while their specific pub- lic health goals and personal recommendations are mostlyconcerned with vegetables and fruits, and then with r ed meat and processed meat, where the evidence on cancer is strongest. The same applies to physical activity. The evidence shows that all types and degrees of physical activity protect or probably protect against some common cancers. Recom- mendation 2 ther efore does not specify any particular phys - ical activity (of which sport and exercise are one type). Rather, it recommends sustained physical activi-ty as part of active ways of life. What type of physical 12.1 Principles 370PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS 12.1.4 Cancer in general This Report is concerned with the prevention of cancer in general. Evidence for particular cancer sites provided the building blocks. A key task for the Panel was to take this spe-cific evidence and formulate recommendations that would, in general, lead to a lower burden from cancer regardless of site. This broad approach is appropriate from the public health point of view. International agencies, national governments,other policy-makers, health professionals, and people with- in communities and families, and also as individuals, want to know how to prevent cancer in general.12.1.5 Designed to have major impact Every case of cancer is important. But the responsibility of those concerned with public health is to encourage policies, programmes, and choices that will have the greatest impact. For this reason, the Panel has paid special attention to the more common cancers; cancers where there is the most clear- cut evidence of modification of risk by food, nutrition, phys- ical activity, and body composition; and cancers that may most readily be prevented by achievable recommendations.Special attention has also been paid to those aspects of food and nutrition, physical activity, and body composition that seem most likely to prevent cancers of a number of sites. This matrix displays the Panel's most confident judgements on the strength of the evidence causally relating food, nutrition, and physical activity to the risk of cancer. It is a synthesis of all the matrices introducing the text of Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of this Report, but showsonly judgements of 'convincing' and 'pr obable', on which the following recommendations are based. It does not show a detailed breakdown of the individual foods, drinks, and their constituents. The full matrix, which also includes judgements of 'limited \u2014 suggestive', is on the fold-out section, which can be found inside the back cover of this Repor t. In this matrix, the columns cor respond to the cancer sites that ar e the subject of Chapter 7 and body fatness that is the subject of Chapter 8. The rows correspond to factors that the Panel judges to be 'convincing' or 'probable', either as protective against or causative of cancer of the sites specified, or of weight gain, overweight, or obesity. Such judgements usually justify public health goals andpersonal r ecommendations. The str ength of the evidence is shown by the height of the blocks in this matrix \u2014 see the key .

These diseases are nutritional deficiencies; relevant infectious diseases, especially diarrhoea and respiratory infections ofearly childhood; and chr onic diseases other than cancer . As stated above, the recommendations here are designed to prevent cancer as a whole. For similar reasons of publichealth, the Panel, in considering and judging the secondary evidence presented in Chapter 10, has made sure that the recommendations here take the prevention of other diseases into account. Often recommendations to prevent cancer are much the same as recommendations to control or prevent otherdiseases. When this is evidently so , the P anel has stated that its recommendations are supported or reinforced. Occasionally , recommendations to prevent other diseases include factors that evidently do not apply to cancer: for example, saturated fatty acids, contained mostly in animalfoods, ar e accepted to be a cause of cor onary heart disease, but have no special relevance to the risk of cancer. There are also some cases where recommendations to pre- vent other diseases conflict, or seem to conflict, with those for cancer. One example is alcoholic drinks. While no report on cardiovascular disease has ever recommended consump-tion of alcoholic drinks, low levels of consumption of alco- holic drinks are likely to protect against coronary heart disease; wher eas there is no evidence that alcoholic drinks at any level of consumption have any benefit for any can - cer. In cases like this, the Panel's recommendations may be modified to take such a conflict into account; this is clearlyindicated in the r ecommendations. Public health professionals who advise on preventing cancer, including those respon- sible for planning food supplies or exerciseprogrammes (for example, for schools, hos- pitals, or canteens), or those working in clinical settings, need to be able to give spe-cific, actionable, and relevant advice that includes prevention of cancer. To do this they need to know how much of what foods and drinks, what levels of body fatness, and how much physical activ- ity are most likely to protect against cancer.So do people in general, as members of communities and families, as well as indi- viduals. For these reasons, the personal and public health goals in each of the rec- ommendations are quantified wherever possible. Translation of an overall body of current evidence into quantified r ecommendations is a challenge for all expert panels respon- sible for recommendations designed toguide public policy, and professional and personal decisions. This process is not and cannot be 'an exact science'. Within anypopulation, people dif fer fr om one anoth - er, and there are differences between pop- ulations as well. A single, numericalrecommendation is not able to encompass these differing needs and so will necessar- ily be impr ecise. Furthermore, the evidence rarely shows a clear point above or below which risk changes suddenly. Rather, there is usually acontinuous r elationship between the expo - sure, be it body fatness, physical activity, or level of consumption of a food or drink,and cancer risk. The shape of this 'doseresponse' may var y \u2014 sometimes it is a straight line, or it may be curved, for instance J-shaped or U-shaped. All of thesefactors need to be taken into account. The quantified recommendations are therefore based on the evidence but are also a mat-ter of judgement. For example, the evidence on alcoholic drinks and breast cancer, as shown in chap-ters 4.8 and 7.10, does not show any 'safe threshold'. The risk evidently increases, albeit modestly, at any level of intake ofany alcoholic drink. And there is no nutri- tional need to consume alcohol. So in this case, the appropriate recommendationbased solely on the evidence for breast can- cer would be not to consume alcoholic drinks; the quantified recommendationwould be zero. However, the integrated approach that guides these recommendations means thatthe Panel has taken into account evidence for a likely pr otective ef fect of modest amounts of alcohol against coronary heart disease, and has not made this recommen-dation based only on the evidence for can- cer (see recommendation 6). In addition, in some cases, there is evi- dence for adverse ef fects unr elated to can - cer risk that might help to quantify recommendations. Physical activity is a casein point. The evidence, as shown in Chapters 5 and 7, shows that high levels of all types of physical activity pr otect or may protect against some cancers, and also thatlow levels increase the risk of these cancers. But there is also evidence (not derived fromthe systematic literatur e reviews), that above certain high levels, which vary depending on people's general state of fit-ness, physical activity can provoke an unde-sirable inflammator y response. The Panel also used such an approach in considering the minimum limit for healthybody mass index, which does not derive from the evidence on cancer. The implica- tion is that upper as well as lower limitsmay need to be recommended. These quantified recommendations are also guided by the ranges of foods anddrinks, physical activity, and body composi- tion identified in the studies whose results, taken together, form the basis for thePanel's judgements. High and low limits can be set by simply following the ranges in the studies themselves, mostly cohort studies. The case for doing this is quite strong; this prospective evidence provides a robust basis for defining the dose response. On theother hand, many studies have been carried out among populations who have only a rather narrow range of dietary intakes, lev-els of physical activity, and degree of body fatness, which makes detection of associa - tions difficult. Further, these ranges may not themselves be optimal, and this makesit difficult to define what is healthy. In such cases, a recommended range based only on the results of such studies would be flawed.Ecological studies, which often addr ess a much wider range of intakes, were also part of this review and, though not centralto the judgement of causality , never theless inform the quantification of the recom- mendations. As well as considering the evidence from studies on cancer, the Panel, in common with others, has also used its collectiveknowledge of other r elevant considerations in making the quantified recommendations in this chapter. It has also taken intoaccount the ranges of intake of foods anddrinks, and the ranges of advisable body composition and physical activity recom- mended in other r eports.Box 12.1 Quantification372PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS 12.1.7 Challenging The Panel emphasises that food and life should be enjoyed. The Panel recognises that for many people, these recommen- dations will involve change. People tend to enjoy ways of lifethat they have become used to. However, when they change, people often enjoy their new ways of life as much or more. The Panel is aware of the importance of aspirational goals and recommendations. To achieve substantial public and per- sonal health gain, some of these need to be challenging. For many populations and people, especially in industri- alised or urban settings, achieving all of these recommen- dations will not be easy. Levels of physical activity within societies that are basically sedentary, and energy density of diets, are often well outside the ranges recommended here.But the Panel believes that populations and people who achieve these recommendations will not only reduce theirrisk of cancer, as well as of other diseases, but are also like- ly to improve their positive health and well-being. Sometimes it may take time for people to achieve changes. The P anel has tak en this into account when applying the evidence to framing these recommendations. See bo x 12.2. Some people will not be able to follow some or all of theserecommendations because of their situation or circum- stances. For such people, the recommendations as stated here may be unattainable, but working towards them will also reduce the risk of cancer, although to a lesser degree. The evidence reviewed by the Panel more often than not does not show thr esholds of food and drink consumption, body fat - ness, or physical activity below or above which the risk of can - cer suddenly changes. In such cases, any change in the exposurewould be expected to lead to a change in cancer risk, whatev-er the star ting level, and no single point lends itself to being an obvious r ecommended level. Recommendations might then sim- ply state 'the less the better' or 'the more the better'. However, while that would be faithful to the evidence, it is less helpful for people trying to implement change \u2014 the question arises of how much mor e or less, or of what level should be a tar get. These judgements take account of several factors \u2014 the range of foods and drinks consumed, the level of physical activity or degree of body fatness found in the studies reviewed, or the possibility of adverse effects at particularly high or low levels, but also the pr ecise natur e of the r elationship between them and the risk of cancer. In some cases, this may be a relatively straight line, in others it may be curved, for instance either U- shaped or J-shaped. Ther efore the Panel has chosen to make quantified recommendations that in its judgement would result in a real health gain, and are achievable yet challenging. However, it would be wrong to interpret this as meaning that any movement towards them, but which did not reach them,was valueless. On the contrary, these recommendations should act as a spur to change of any amount. While it is tr ue that a smaller change than recommended would lead to less reductionin risk, any change at all would nevertheless provide at least some benefit. A per ceived inability to achieve the tar gets should not be a disincentive to making changes to move in that direction. So a change from eating two portions of vegetables daily to three, or a reduction in body mass index from 29 to 27, while not meet-ing the goals, would nevertheless be valuable.Box 12.2 Making gradual changes373CHAPTER 12 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS The Panel's goals and recommendations, the culmination of five years of work, are guided by the principles above. They are based on the best available evidence, which hasbeen identified, collected, analysed, displayed,summarised, and judged systematically, transparently, andindependently. The public health goals are for populations and are therefore principally for health professionals; the recommendations are for people, as communities,families, and individuals. The eight generalrecommendations are followed by two specialrecommendations. Together they are designed to beintegrated and to contribute to healthy dietary patterns, healthy ways of life, and general well-being. The P anel emphasises that the setting of r ecommendations is not and cannot be 'an exact science'. Recommendations derive fr om judgements based on the best evidence but that evidence and those judgements may still not be such that only one possible recommendation would follow. Severalaspects of recommendations designed to improve health canbe questioned. The Panel believes nevertheless that its rec- ommendations are as firmly based as the science currentlyallows, and ther efore represent a sound base for developing policy and action . The 10 recommendations here derive from the evidence on food, nutrition , and physical activity but not on their wider socioeconomic, cultural, and other determinants. The Panel is aware that patterns of diet and physical activity, as well as the risk of diseases such as cancer , are also crucial - ly influenced by social and environmental factors. These broader factors, and recommendations designed as the basisfor policies and programmes that can create healthier soci-eties and environments, are the subject of a further reportto be published in late 2008. The P anel has agr eedthat its r ecommendations normally derive fr om evidence that justifies judgements of 'convinc - ing' and 'probable', as shown in the top halves of the matri- ces in the chapters and sections of Part 2. This means thatthe evidence is sufficiently str ong to make recommendations designed as the basis for public health policies and programmes. Ther efore judgements that evidence is 'limit- ed \u2014 suggestive' do not normally form the basis for r ecom - mendations. As shown in the following pages, the goals and recom- mendations themselves ar e boxed. They begin with a gen - eral statement. This is followed by the public health goals and the personal recommendations, together with any nec-essary footnotes. These footnotes are an integral part of the recommendations. The boxed texts are followed by passages summarising the r elevant judgements made by the Panel. Then the specifications made in the public health goals andpersonal recommendations are explained. This is followed by passages of further clarification and qualification as neces-sary: in special cir cumstances, the points made here are alsointegral to the r ecommendations. Finally, guides showing how people can sustain the recommendations are included. The public health goals ar e for populations and so ar e pri- marily for health pr ofessionals, and ar e quantified wher e appropriate. 'Population' includes the world population, national populations, and population groups such as school-childr en, hospital patients, and staff who eat in canteens, generally or in specific settings. The personal recommenda- tions are for people as communities, families, and as indi-viduals. This allows for the fact that decisions on the choice of foods and drinks are often taken communally or within families, or by the family members r esponsible for buying and pr eparing meals and food, as well as by individuals. Personal recommendations are best followed in conjunction with public health goals. For example, the recommendationthat people walk briskly for at least 30 minutes ever y day is RECOMMENDATIONS BODY FATNESS Be as lean as possible within the normal range of body weight PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Be physically active as part of everyday life FOODS AND DRINKS THAT PROMOTE WEIGHT GAIN Limit consumption of energy-dense foods Avoid sugary drinks PLANT FOODS Eat mostly foods of plant origin ANIMAL FOODS Limit intake of red meat and avoid processed meat ALCOHOLIC DRINKS Limit alcoholic drinks PRESER VATION, PROCESSING, PREPARATION Limit consumption of salt Avoid mouldy cereals (grains) or pulses (legumes) DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS Aim to meet nutritional needs through diet alone BREASTFEEDING Mothers to breastfeed; children to be breastfed CANCER SURVIVORS Follow the r ecommendations for cancer prevention12.2 Goals and recommendations374PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS to enable them to increase their average physical activity level (PAL) by about 0.1. The Panel concludes that the evidence that high body fat- ness and also physical inactivity are causes of a number ofcancers, including common cancers, is particularly strong. For this reason, the first three sets of goals and recommen- dations are designed as a basis for policies, programmes, and choices whose purpose is to maintain healthy body weights and to sustain physical activity, throughout life. The remain-ing five general recommendations are not in any order of pri- ority; instead, they follow the order that their subjects appear in the chapters in Part 2. After the eight general rec- ommendations, there are two special recommendations, one on breastfeeding and one for cancer survivors, that are tar-geted at specific groups of people. These goals and recommendations are concerned with food and nutrition, physical activity, and body fatness. Other factors that modify the risk of cancer outside the remit of this Report, such as smoking, infectious agents, radiation,industrial chemicals, and medication , are specified in Chapter 2 and throughout Chapter 7. The P anel emphasises the importance of not smoking and of avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke.RECOMMENDATION 1 BODY FATNESS Be as lean as possible within the normal range1of body weight PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS Median adult body mass index (BMI) to be between 21 and 23, depending on the normal range for different populations2 The proportion of the population that is overweight or obese to be no more than the current level, or preferably lower, in 10 years PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Ensure that body weight through childhood and adolescent gr owth pr ojects3towar ds the lower end of the normal BMI range at age 21 Maintain body weight within the normal range from age 21 Avoid weight gain and increases in waist cir cumfer ence throughout adulthood 1'Normal range' r issued by nments or the W orld Health Or ganization 2To minimise the proportion of the population outside the normal range 3'Projects' in this context means following a pattern of growth (weight and height) throughout childhood that leads to adult BMI at the lower end of thenormal range. Such patterns of growth are specified in International Obesity Task For ce and WHO gr owth r eference charts Evidence The evidence that overweight and obesity incr ease the risk of a number of cancers is now even mor e impr essive than in the mid-1990s. Since that time, rates of overweight and obesity, in adults as well as in children, have greatlyincreased in most countries. The evidence that gr eater body fatness is a cause of cancers of the color ectum, oesophagus (adenocar cinoma), endo - metrium, pancreas, kidney, and breast (postmenopause) is convincing. It is a probable cause of cancer of the gallblad-der. Body fatness pr obably pr otects against pr emenopausal breast cancer, but increases the risk of breast cancer overall. This is because postmenopausal breast cancer is more com-mon. The evidence that abdominal (central) fatness is a cause of cancer of the colorectum is convincing; and it is a probable cause of cancers of the pancreas and endometrium, and of postmenopausal br east cancer . Adult weight gain is a probable cause of postmenopausal breast cancer. Greater birth weight is a probable cause of premenopausal breastcancer . Also see Chapters 6 and 7. The evidence that the factors that lead to greater adult attained height, or its consequences, increase the risk of cancers of thecolor ectum and br east (postmenopause) is convincing; and they probably also increase the risk of cancers of the pancreas, breast (premenopause) and ovary. In addition, the factors that lead togreater birth weight, or its consequences, are probably a cause of premenopausal breast cancer. Also see chapter 6. The Panel has agr eed that height and bir th weight ar e them - selves unlikely directly to modify the risk of cancer. They are markers for genetic, environmental, hormonal, and nutritionalfactors af fecting gr owth during the period from preconception to completion of linear growth. However, the precise mecha- nisms by which they operate ar e currently unclear. In addition, they are known to have different associations with other chron-ic diseases such as car diovascular disease. For these r easons, they are not the subject of recommendations in this chapter. Understanding the factors that influence growth, and how they might modify the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases, is an important question for future research, including the rel-ative importance of genetic and environmental factors, and when in the life course nutritional factors might be most r ele- vant. Identifying optimal growth trajectories that protecthealth not only in childhood but also throughout life is a major challenge for the r esear ch and public health communities.Greater birth weight, and adult attained height375CHAPTER 12 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Justification Maintenance of a healthy weight throughout life may be one of the most important ways to protect against cancer. Thiswill also protect against a number of other common chron-ic diseases. Weight gain, overweight, and obesity are now generally much more common than in the 1980s and 1990s. Rates of overweight and obesity doubled in many high-income coun-tries between 1990 and 2005. In most countries in Asia and Latin America, and some in Africa, chronic diseases includ- ing obesity are now more prevalent than nutritional defi- ciencies and infectious diseases. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of some can- cers. Overweight and obesity also increase the risk of condi-tions including dyslipidaemia, hypertension and stroke, type2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease. Overweight in child- hood and early life is liable to be followed by overweight and obesity in adulthood. Further details of evidence and judge-ments can be found in Chapters 6 and 8. Maintenance of a healthy weight throughout life may be one of the mostimportant ways to pr otect against cancer . Public health goals The points here are additional to those made in the footnotes to the goals above. Median adult BMI for dif ferent populations to be between 21 and 23, depending on the nor mal range To date, the range of normal weight has been usually iden - tified as a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9; overweight and obe- sity has been identified as a BMI of 25 or over 30, respectively.However , the evidence that is the basis for this R eport does not show any threshold at a BMI of 25. The relationship between BMI and risk of disease varies between different pop-ulations (see chapter 8.4), and so the median population BMIthat accompanies lowest risk will vary. The Panel therefore rec- ommends that the population median lies between 21 and 23, which allows for this variation . Within any population, the range of individual BMIs will var y around this. The proportion of the population that is overweight or obese to be no mor e than the current level, or preferably lower, in 10 years The context for this goal, which lik e the others specified her e is designed as a guide for national and other population poli- cies, is the current general rapid rise in overweight and obe-sity. The goal pr oposes a time-frame. P olicy-mak ers are encouraged to frame specific goals according to their own circumstances. The implications of the goal for countrieswhere there is a current increasing trend are that over the 10-year period, the increase would stop, and then rates of overweight and obesity would begin to drop. While it is clear that obesity itself is a cause of some can - cers and of other diseases, it is also a marker for dietary and physical activity patterns that independently lead to poorhealth. In the chart above, a BMI between 18.5 and 25 is highlighted. A BMI between 18.5 and 25 has conventionally been regard- ed as normal or healthy. BMIs under 18.5 represent under-weight, which is unhealthy; BMIs between 25 and 30 ar e called overweight; BMIs over 30 are called obesity; and BMIs over 40 are designated as extremely (morbidly) obese. However , different cut-off points for overweight and obe- sity have been agreed in some countries; these cut-offs usual- ly specify over weight at BMI less than 25, and obesity at BMI less than 30. Such specifications should be used for and by peo - ple living in those countries. These are shown in dotted lines. BMI is calculated using weight and height. Using the graph above, a person who is 170 cm tall and weighs 68 kg has a BMI within the normal range. To calculate BMI, divide weight (kg)by height (m) squared. Therefore, a person who is 1.7 m tall and who weighs 68 kg has a BMI of 23.5. It should be noted that BMI should be interpreted with cau- tion, as in some cases it may be misleading, for instance in mus - cular people such as manual workers and some athletes, andolder people, children, or people less than 5 feet tall (152 cm).Box 12.3 Height, weight, and ranges of body mass index (BMI) 145125 120 115 110 105 100 95 90 85 80 75 70 65 60 55 50 45 40275 264 253 242 231 220 209 198 187 176 165 154 143 132 165 170 175 180 185 190 195 200Height (ft, in) Height (cm) Weight (lb)Weight (kg) Underweight NormalOverweight ObeseExtremely (morbidly) obese Proposed additional cut offs for Asian populations18.525303540 37.5 32.5 27.5 23376PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS Personal recommendations The points here are additional to those made in the footnotes to the recommendations above. Ensure that body weight through childhood and adolescent growth projects towards the lower end of the normal BMI range at age 21 Maintain body weight within the normal range from age 21 These two related recommendations emphasise the impor- tance of prevention of excess weight gain, overweight, and obesity, beginning in early life \u2014 indeed, in infancy andchildhood. As stated, the normal range of BMI is within 18.5to 25, with some variation between countries; where theagreed range is different this should be used as the guide. See box 12.3. These recommendations do not mean that all healthy peo- ple within the normal range of BMI need necessarily aim to lower their BMI. However, people who have gained weight,even within the normal range, ar e advised to aim to r eturn to their original weight. People above the normal range of BMI are recommended to lose weight to approach the normal range. See 'Guidance'and also recommendations 2 and 3. Avoid weight gain and increases in waist cir cumfer ence throughout adulthood There may be specific adverse effects fr om gaining weight during adulthood (see chapter 6.1.1.3), and so maintenance of weight within the normal range throughout adult life isrecommended. The World Health Organization reference values for waist circumferences of 94 cm (37 inches) in men and 80 cm (31.5inches) in women (on a population basis) are based on theirrough equivalence to a BMI of around 25, whereas waist cir-cumfer ences of 102 cm (40.2 inches) in men and 88 cm (34.6 inches) in women ar e equivalent to a BMI of ar ound 30. F or Asian populations, cut-offs for waist cir cumferences of 90 cm (35.4 inches) for men and 80 cm (31.5 inches) for women have been proposed. Guidance This overall r ecommendation can best be achieved by being physically active thr oughout life, and by choosing diets based on foods that have low energy density and avoiding sugary drinks. People who are already outside the normal BMI range should seek advice from appropriately qualified professionals with a view to returning towards the normal range. However, for weight control, recommendations 1, 2, and 3 can be followed. RECOMMENDATION 2 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Be physically active as part of everyday life PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS The proportion of the population that is sedentary1 to be halved every 10 years Average physical activity levels (PALs)1to be above 1.6 PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Be moderately physically active, equivalent to brisk walking,2for at least 30 minutes every day As fitness impr oves, aim for 60 minutes or mor e of moderate, or for 30 minutes or more of vigor ous, physical activity ever y day2 3 Limit sedentary habits such as watching television 1The term 'sedentary' refers to a PAL of 1.4 or less. PAL is a way of representing the average intensity of daily physical activity . PAL is calculated as total ener gy expenditur e as a multiple of basal metabolic rate 2Can be incorporated in occupational, transport, household, or leisure activities 3This is because physical activity of longer duration or gr eater intensity is more beneficial Evidence The evidence that physical activity of all types protects against cancer and also against obesity, and therefore indi-rectly those cancers whose risk is increased by obesity, hascontinued to accumulate since the early 1990s. The evidence that physical activity pr otects against colon cancer is convincing. It probably protects against post- menopausal breast cancer and endometrial cancer. Also seeChapter 5. The evidence that physical activity protects against weight gain, over weight, and obesity is convincing. The evidence that sedentar y living incr eases the risk of weight gain , over - weight, and obesity is also convincing. Television viewing, a form of very sedentary behaviour, is probably a cause ofweight gain , over weight, and obesity . Also see Chapter 8. Justification Most populations, and people living in industrialised and urban settings, have habitual levels of activity below levelsto which humans ar e adapted. With industrialisation, urbanisation, and mechanisation, populations and people become more sedentary. As withoverweight and obesity , sedentar y ways of life have been 377CHAPTER 12 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS usual in high-income countries since the second half of the 20th century. They are now common if not usual in most countries. All forms of physical activity protect against some cancers, as well as against weight gain, overweight, and obesity; cor- respondingly, sedentary ways of life are a cause of these can- cers and of weight gain, overweight, and obesity. Weight gain, overweight, and obesity are also causes of some can- cers independently of the level of physical activity. Furtherdetails of evidence and judgements can be found in Chapters 5, 6, and 8. The evidence summarised in Chapter 10 also shows that physical activity protects against other diseases and that sedentary ways of life are causes of these diseases. Public health goals The points here are additional to those made in the footnotes to the goals above. The pr opor tion of the population that is sedentar y to be halved every 10 years As above, the context for this goal, which like the others spec- ified here is designed as a guide for national and other pop-ulation policies, is the current general rapid rise in sedentaryways of life. Again as above, the goal proposes a time-frame.Its achievement will require leadership from governments,city planners, school boar ds, and others. Policy-makers are encouraged to frame goals accor ding to their specific cir - cumstances. The r ecommendation tak es account of the magnitude of health gain expected from moving, even modestly, from sedentary ways of life, compared to increasing the level ofactivity for alr eady active people. Average physical activity levels to be above 1.6Average PALs for people in high income populations are between around 1.4 and 1.6. PALs for people in the normal range of BMI often average around 1.6. The Panel empha- sises that the goal is to move above a PAL of 1.6. Levels of 1.7 and more are readily achieved by active and fit people. See Chapter 5. Personal recommendations The points here are additional to those made in the footnotes to the recommendations above. Be moderately physically active, equivalent to brisk walking for at least 30 minutes every day As fitness improves, aim for 60 minutes or more of moderate, or for 30 minutes or more of vigorous, physical activity every day These recommendations are linked. The first derives from the evidence on cancer . The second derives fr om the evi - dence on overweight and obesity, themselves a cause of some cancers. In making these two r ecommendations, the Panel also recognises that for people who have been habit- ually sedentary for some time, a first recommendation,which is also meant to be intermediary, is sensible. Levelsof activity above those recommended here are likely to beadditionally beneficial, unless excessive, which may lead toan acute inflammator y response indicated by muscle pain and vulnerability to infections. Limit sedentar y habits such as watching television Watching television is a form of very sedentary behaviour. Childr en may commonly watch television for mor e than three hours a day, and are often also exposed to heavy mar- keting of foods that are high in energy and of sugary drinkson television. Table 12.1 How to achieve a healthy physical activity level (PAL) This table pr ovides guidance on the impact of specific periods of activity on overall physical activity levels. Increasing activity can be achieved in many different ways. See Chapter 5. The table lists some examples of the ef fect on average daily P AL of doing dif ferent activities for different periods of time. The estimates are approximate and r ounded. So for a person with a P AL of 1.6, an extra 30 minutes daily of moderate activity would incr ease P AL to ar ound 1.7. Categor y Increase in daily PAL Increase in daily PAL Increase in daily PAL Increase in daily PAL Increase in daily PAL (for an hour of (for 20 minutes of (for 30 minutes (for 40 minutes (for an hour of activity a week ) activity a day ) of activity a day ) of activity a day ) activity a day ) Sedentar y Lying down quietly 0 0000 Light Walking slowly , 0.01 0.03 0.05 0.06 0.09 light gar dening, housework Moderate Walking briskly , cycling, 0.03 0.07 0.10 0.13 0.20 dancing, swimming Vigorous Running, tennis, football 0.07 0.17 0.25 0.35 0.50378PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS Guidance Most people can readily build regular moderate, and some vigorous, physical activity into their everyday lives. Moderate physical activity can readily be built into everyday life. It is not necessary to devote a continuous half hour every day to moderate activity. With walking as an example, walk briskly all or part of the way to and from work, or on local errands, or at school; take a break for a walk in the middleof the day or the evening; use stairs rather than the eleva- tor. The same applies to other moderate activities. The best choice of vigorous physical activity is that which is most enjoyable for the family or the individual \u2014 be it swimming, running, dancing, rowing, cycling, hill walking,aerobic workouts, or team games such as football and bad-minton. Resistance and balance training are also beneficial.Some sports and recreations such as golf are not vigorously active. A good test that activity is vigorous is that it involves sweating and raises heart rate to 60-80 per cent of its max-imum. People whose work is sedentary should take special care to build moderate and vigor ous physical activity into their everyday lives. It is also important to avoid long periods of sedentary behaviour, such as watching television. This behaviour is alsooften associated with consumption of energy-dense food andsugary drinks. A common misconception is that sport or ex ercise is the only way in which to be physically active. Physical activity includes that involved with transport (such as walking and cycling),household (chor es, gar dening), and occupation (manual and other active work), as well as recreational activity. See table 12.1 for guidance on how to achieve and main- tain a healthy P AL. This table pr ovides guidance on the impact of specific periods of activity on overall PALs. Increasing activity can be achieved in many different ways. The table lists some examples of the effect on average daily PAL of doing different activities for different periods of time.The estimates ar e approximate and rounded. So for a per- son with a P AL of 1.6, an extra 30 minutes daily of moder - ate activity would incr ease their P AL to around 1.7.RECOMMENDATION 3 FOODS AND DRINKS THAT PROMOTE WEIGHT GAIN Limit consumption of energy-dense foods1 Avoid sugary drinks2 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS Average energy density of diets3to be lowered towards 125 kcal per 100 g Population average consumption of sugary drinks2 to be halved every 10 years PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Consume energy-dense foods1 4 sparingly Avoid sugar y drinks2 Consume 'fast foods'5sparingly, if at all 1Energy-dense foods are here defined as those with an energy content of more than about 225-275 kcal per 100 g 2This principally r efers to drinks with added sugars. Fr uit juices should also be limited 3This does not include drinks 4Limit processed energy-dense foods (also see recommendation 4). Relatively unprocessed energy-dense foods, such as nuts and seeds, have not been shown to contribute to weight gain when consumed as par t of typical diets, and these and many vegetable oils are valuable sources of nutrients 5The term 'fast foods' refers to readily available convenience foods that tend to be ener gy-dense and consumed fr equently and in lar ge por tions Evidence Evidence shows that foods and diets that ar e high in energy, particularly those that ar e highly pr ocessed, and sugary drinks, increase the risk of overweight and obesity . Some foods low in energy density probably protect against some cancers. Energy-dense foods and sugary drinks probably promote weight gain, especially when consumed frequently and in large portions. Corr espondingly, low energy-dense foods, (often r elatively unpr ocessed) pr obably pr otect against weight gain, overweight, and obesity. Specific types of low energy- dense foods, such as vegetables and fruits and foods con-taining dietar y fibr e, probably pr otect against some cancers. Also see recommendation 4, Chapter 8, and box 12.4. Justification Consumption of energy-dense foods and sugary drinks is increasing worldwide and is probably contributing to the global incr ease in obesity . This overall recommendation is mainly designed to prevent and to contr ol weight gain , over weight, and obesity. Further details 379CHAPTER 12 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS of evidence and judgements can be found in Chapter 8. 'Energy density' measures the amount of energy (in kcal or kJ) per weight (usually 100 g) of food. Food supplies that are mainly made up of processed foods, which often contain sub-stantial amounts of fat or sugar, tend to be more energy-dense than food supplies that include substantial amounts of fresh foods. Taken together, the evidence shows that it is not spe- cific dietary constituents that are problematic, so much as the contribution these make to the energy density of diets. Because of their water content, drinks are less energy-dense than foods. However, sugary drinks provide energy but do not seem to induce satiety or compensatory reduction in subse- quent energy intake, and so promote overconsumption of energy and thus weight gain. Public health goals The points here are additional to those made in the footnotes to the goals above. Average ener gy density of diets to be lowered towards 125 kcal per 100 g Diets appropriately low in energy density are identified as supplying around 125 kcal (or 525 kJ) per 100 g, excludingany drinks. These of course will include foods whose energydensity is higher than this average. Population average consumption of sugar y drinks to be halved ever y 10 years The context for this goal, which lik e others specified her e is designed as a guide for national and other population policies, is the current general rapid rise in weight gain, overweight,and obesity , especially in childr en and young people, and the rapid rise in consumption of sugary drinks. As above, the goal proposes a time-frame. Achievement of this challenging goalimplies support from regulatory authorities and from manu-facturers of sugary drinks. Policy-makers are encouraged toframe goals accor ding to their specific circumstances. Personal r ecommendations The points here are additional to those made in the footnotes to the recommendations above. Consume energy-dense foods sparingly Energy-dense foods ar e her e defined as those supplying mor e than about 225-275 kcal (950-1150 kJ) per 100 g. Foods nat- urally high in dietary fibre or water, such as vegetables andfruits, and cer eals (grains) pr epared without fats and oils, ar e usually low in energy density. Non-starchy vegetables, roots and tubers, and fruits provide roughly between 10 and 100 kcal per100 g, and cereals (grains) and pulses (legumes) between about 60 and 150 kcal per 100 g. Breads and lean meat, poul- try, and fish usually provide between about 100 and 225 kcal per 100 g. Most foods containing substantial amounts of fats,oils, or added sugars, including many 'fast foods' as defined here, as well as many pre-prepared dishes and snacks, bakedgoods, desserts, and confectioner y, are high in energy density.This recommendation does not imply that all energy-dense foods should be avoided. Some, such as certain oils of plant origin, nuts, and seeds, are important sources of nutrients; their consumption has not been linked with weight gain, andby their nature they tend to be consumed sparingly. Avoid sugary drinks This recommendation is especially targeted at soft drinks (including colas, sodas, and squashes) with added sugars. Consumption of such drinks, including in 'super-sizes', has greatly increased in many countries. The evidence that such drinks 'fool' the human satiety mechanism, thereby promoting weight gain, is impressive. They are best not drunk at all. Theimplication of this recommendation is to prefer water. Low-energy soft drinks, and coffee and tea (without added sugar),are also preferable. Fruit juices, even with no added sugar, are likely to have the same effect and may promote weight gain, and so they should not be drunk in large quantities. Consume 'fast foods' sparingly, if at all As already stated, 'fast foods' does not refer to all foods (and drinks) that are readily available for consumption. The termrefers to readily available convenience foods that tend to beenergy-dense, and that are often consumed frequently and inlarge portions. Most of the evidence on 'fast foods' is fromstudies of such foods, such as bur gers, fried chicken pieces, French fries (chips), and fatty or sugary drinks, as served in international franchised outlets. Guidance Foods and diets that are low in energy density, and avoidance of sugary drinks, ar e the best choices, in particular for peo - ple who lead generally sedentary lives. The recommendation above can be best achieved by replac- ing energy-dense foods, such as fatty and sugary processedfoods and 'fast foods', with those of low ener gy density, such as plant foods including non-star chy vegetables, fruits, and r el- atively unpr ocessed cer eals (grains) (see recommendation 4), and replacing sugary drinks with unsweetened drinks such as water, and unsweetened tea or coffee. The total ener gy content of diets is related not only to the energy density of individual foods consumed, but also to the frequency with which they ar e eaten and the portion size. The physical capacity of the human stomach and digestive systemis limited. In general, people usually consume roughly the same amount of food from day to day, measured by weight.Energy-dense diets can undermine normal appetite r egulation and therefore lead to greater energy intake. Sugary drinks are a particular problem as these can be drunk in large quantities without a feeling of satiety. By replacing these foods and drinks with those of low energy density , such as vegetables and fruits, relatively unprocessed cereals (grains) and pulses (legumes), water and non-caloric drinks, the risk of weight gain is reduced, which there- fore would be expected to reduce the risk of developing somecancers. 380PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS RECOMMENDATION 4 PLANT FOODS Eat mostly foods of plant origin PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS Population average consumption of non-starchy1 vegetables and of fruits to be at least 600 g (21 oz) daily2 Relatively unprocessed cereals (grains) and/or pulses (legumes), and other foods that are a natural source of dietary fibre, to contribute to a population average of at least 25 g non-starch polysaccharide daily PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Eat at least five portions/servings (at least 400 g or 14 oz) of a variety2of non-starchy vegetables and of fruits every day Eat relatively unprocessed cereals (grains) and/or pulses (legumes) with every meal3 Limit r efined starchy foods People who consume starchy roots or tubers4 as staples also to ensur e intake of suf ficient non-starchy vegetables, fruits, and pulses (legumes) 1This is best made up fr om a range of various amounts of non-starchy vegetables and fruits of different colours including red, green, yellow, white, purple, and orange, including tomato-based products and allium vegetables such as garlic 2Relatively unpr ocessed cer eals (grains) and/or pulses (legumes) to contribute to an average of at least 25 g non-starch polysaccharide daily 3These foods ar e low in ener gy density and so promote healthy weight 4For example, populations in Africa, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region Evidence The evidence that diets high in vegetables and fruits pr otect against cancer is overall less compelling than in the mid- 1990s. However , vegetables and fruits, and other foods con - taining dietary fibr e, probably pr otect against a number of cancers. Non-star chy vegetables pr obably pr otect against cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, and stomach. Allium vegetables in particular probably protect against can-cer of the stomach. Garlic probably protects against cancers of the colon and rectum. Fruits probably protect against can- cers of the mouth, phar ynx, larynx, oesophagus, lung, and stomach. Also see chapter 4.2. Foods containing dietary fibre probably protect against cancers of the colorectum. Foods containing folate probablyprotect against cancer of the pancr eas. F oods containingcarotenoids probably protect against cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and lung; foods containing beta-carotene probably protect against oesophageal cancer; and foods con- taining lycopene probably protect against prostate cancer.Foods containing vitamin C probably protect against oesophageal cancer; and foods containing selenium proba- bly protect against prostate cancer. It is unlikely that foods containing beta-carotene have a substantial effect on the risk of cancers of the prostate or skin (non-melanoma). It can-not be confidently assumed that the effects of these foods can be attributed to the nutrient specified, which may be act- ing as a marker for other constituents in the foods. Also see chapter 4.2. Justification An integrated approach to the evidence shows that most diets that are protective against cancer are mainly made up from foods of plant origin. Higher consumption of several plant foods pr obably pr otects against cancers of various sites. What is meant by 'plant- based' is diets that give mor e emphasis to those plant foods that are high in nutrients, high in dietary fibre (and so in non-starch polysaccharides), and low in energy density. Non-starchy vegetables, and fruits, probably protect against some cancers. Being typically low in energy density,they probably also protect against weight gain. Furtherdetails of evidence and judgements can be found inChapters 4 and 8. Non-starchy vegetables include green, leafy vegetables, broccoli, okra, auber gine (eggplant), and bok choy , but not, for instance, potato, yam, sweet potato, or cassava. Non- starchy roots and tubers include carrots, (celer y root), swede (rutabaga), and turnips. The goals and recommendations here are broadly similar to those that have been issued by other international andnational authoritative organisations (see Chapter 10). Theyderive fr om the evidence on cancer and are supported by evi- dence on other diseases. They emphasise and fruits, and pulses (legumes), all of which contain substantial amounts of dietary fibre and a variety of micronu-trients, and ar e low or relatively low in energy density. These, and not foods of animal origin, are the recommended cen- tre for ever yday meals. Public health goals The points here are additional to those made in the footnotes to the goals above. Population average consumption of non-starchy vegetables and of fruits to be at least 600 g (21 oz) daily This goal r epresents amounts well above average population intak es in almost all parts of the world. Non-star chy veg - etables exclude starchy roots and tubers (such as potatoes and potato products). In populations wher e most people consume at least 400 g 381CHAPTER 12 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS of vegetables and fruits daily (see below), the average consumption is likely to correspond roughly to at least 600 g per day. Relatively unprocessed cereals (grains) and/or pulses (legumes), and other foods that are a natural source of dietary fibre, to contribute to a population average of at least 25 g non-starch polysaccharide daily All cereals (grains) and pulses (legumes) undergo some form of processing before they can be consumed. Cooking is a form of processing. This goal is designed to emphasise the value of wholegrains, and generally of plant foods naturally con- taining substantial amounts of dietary fibre. This does notinclude processed foods with forms of dietary fibre added, forwhich evidence of a protective effect is lacking. A total of 25g of non-starch polysaccharide is roughly equivalent to 32 g of dietary fibre. Also see box 4.1.2 in chapter 4.1. Personal r ecommendations The points here are additional to those made in the footnotes to the r ecommendations above. Eat at least five portions/servings (at least 400 g or 14 oz) of a variety of non-starchy vegetables and of fruits every day Eat r elatively unprocessed cereals (grains) and/or pulses (legumes) with ever y meal Limit r efined star chy foods These three linked recommendations also relate to the pub- lic health goals above. It is lik ely that ther e is further pr o- tective benefit from consuming more than five portions/ servings of non-starchy vegetables and fruits. The recom-mendation on relatively unprocessed cereals (grains) andpulses (legumes) is designed to ensure that these become afeatur e of all meals. Refined starchy foods include products made fr om white flour such as br ead, pasta, pizza; white rice; and also foods that ar e fatty and sugar y, such as cakes, pastries, biscuits (cookies), and other baked goods. People who consume star chy roots and tubers as staples to ensure intake of sufficient non-star chy vegetables, fr uits, and pulses (legumes) In many parts of the world, traditional food systems are based on roots or tubers, such as cassava, sweet potato, yam, or tar o. Traditional food systems should be pr otected: as well as their cultural value, and their suitability to local climate and terrain, they are often nutritionally superior tothe diets that tend to displace them. However, monotonous traditional diets, especially those that contain only small amounts of non-star chy vegetables, fruits, and pulses (legumes), ar e likely to be low in nutrients, which may increase susceptibility to infection and so be relevant to the risk of some cancers. Guidance Maintaining plant-based diets is easily done by planning meals and dishes around plant foods rather than meat andother foods of animal origin. Meat and other animal foods became centrepieces of meals as a r esult of industrialisation , one consequence of which is that meat becomes cheap. As stated above, foods of plant origin are recommended to be the basis of all meals. Ahealthy plate is one that is at least two thir ds full of plant foods; and instead of processed cereals and grains, whole- grain versions are better choices. As stated in recommendation 3, vegetables and fruits are generally low in energy density. Therefore, by consuming theamount of vegetables and fruits r ecommended above, and limiting the amount of ener gy-dense foods consumed, peo - ple can r educe their risk of cancer dir ectly, as well as the risk of overweight and obesity. One portion of vegetables or fruits is approximately 80 g or 3 oz. If consuming the r ecommended amount of vegeta- bles and fruits stated above, average consumption will be at least 400 g or 14 oz per day . Some plant foods are not the subject of goals or recommendations. Nuts, seeds, plant oils. The evidence on nuts, seeds, and plant oils, and the risk of cancer, is not substantial. However, nuts and seeds are sources of dietary fibre, essential fatty acids, and vitamins and minerals. Though they are energy-dense, and so should beeaten sparingly, they have not been associated with weight gain. Similarly, modest amounts of appropriate plant oils can be used as the primary form of fat for use in cooking and food prepa-ration. See chapter 4.2. Sugars. Sugars and also syrups in their various forms are refined from cane, beet, or corn. The evidence on sugary drinks is strong enough to generate goals and recommendations (3, above). The evidence suggesting that foods containing substantial amountsof added sugars increase the risk of colorectal cancer is limited, and so the Panel has made no recommendation. However, thegeneral implication of the goals and recommendations made here is that consumption of foods containing added sugars would be limited. See chapter 4.6.Other plant foods382PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS RECOMMENDATION 5 ANIMAL FOODS Limit intake of red meat1and avoid processed meat2 PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL Population average consumption of red meat to be no more than 300 g (11 oz) a week, very little if any of which to be processed PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION People who eat red meat1 to consume less than 500 g (18 oz) a week, very little if any to be pr ocessed2 1'Red meat' refers to beef, pork, lamb, and goat from domesticated animals including that contained in pr ocessed foods 2'Processed meat' refers to meat preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or addition of chemical pr eservatives, including that contained in processed foods Evidence The evidence that r ed meat, and particularly pr ocessed meat, is a cause of colorectal cancer is stronger now than it was in the mid-1990s. The evidence that red meat is a cause of colorectal cancer is convincing. The evidence that pr ocessed meat is a cause of colorectal cancer is also convincing. Cantonese-style salted fish (see chapter 4.3, box 4.3.5, and also box 12.5) is a prob-able cause of nasopharyngeal cancer: this conclusion doesnot apply to fish prepared (or salted) by other means. Milkfrom cows probably protects against colorectal cancer. Diets high in calcium ar e a pr obable cause of prostate cancer; this effect is only appar ent at high calcium intak es (around 1.5 g per day or more). Also see chapters 4.3 and 4.4. Justification An integrated approach to the evidence also shows that many foods of animal origin ar e nourishing and healthy if consumed in modest amounts. People who eat various forms of vegetarian diets are at low risk of some diseases including some cancers, although it is not easy to separate out these benefits of the diets from other aspects of their ways of life, such as not smoking, drinkinglittle if any alcohol, and so forth. In addition, meat can be a valuable source of nutrients, in particular protein, iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. The P anel emphasises that this over - all recommendation is not for diets containing no meat \u2014 or diets containing no foods of animal origin. The amounts are for weight of meat as eaten. As a rough conversion, 300g of cook ed red meat is equivalent to about 400-450 g rawweight, and 500 g cooked red meat to about 700-750 g raw weight. The exact conversion will depend on the cut of meat, the proportions of lean and fat, and the method and degree of cooking, so more specific guidance is not possible. Red or processed meats are convincing or probable caus- es of some cancers. Diets with high levels of animal fats are often relatively high in energy, increasing the risk of weight gain. Further details of evidence and judgements can be found in Chapters 4 and 8. Public health goal The points here are additional to those made in the footnotes to the goal above. Population average consumption of red meat to be no more than 300 g (11 oz) a week, very little if any of which to be processed This goal is given in terms of weekly consumption to encour- age per ception that r ed meat need not be a daily food. The goal of 300 g or 11 oz a week corresponds to the level of consumption of r ed meat at which the risk of color ectal can - cer can clearly be seen to rise. The evidence on processed meat is even more clear-cut than that on red meat, and thedata do not show any level of intake that can confidently beshown not to be associated with risk. Many animal foods are not the subject of goals or recommen- dations. Poultry, fish. The evidence on poultry and the risk of cancer is not substantial. The evidence suggesting that fish protectsagainst color ectal cancer is limited. (Cantonese-style salted fish is a special case \u2014 see chapter 4.3.) However, people who eat flesh foods are advised to prefer poultry, and all types of fish, tored meat. Flesh from wild animals, birds, and fish, whose nutri- tional pr ofiles ar e dif ferent from those of domesticated and industrially reared creatures, is also preferred. See chapter 4.3. Eggs . The evidence on eggs and the risk of cancer is not sub- stantial. Ther e is no basis for recommending avoidance of eggs to prevent cancer. See chapter 4.3. Milk, cheese, other dair y products. The evidence on cow' s milk, cheese, and foods high in calcium, and the risk of cancer , is har d to interpret. The evidence on colorectal cancer and on prostate cancer seems to be in conflict. After long discussion, the Panel chose to make no recommendations here. See chapter 4.4. Animal fats. The evidence suggesting that animal fats are a cause of colorectal cancer is limited. Animal fats are high in energy andthe Panel integrated the limited evidence suggesting that ani- mal fats ar e a cause of over weight and obesity into its findings on ener gy-dense foods. The implication is that it is best to limit consumption of animal fats, as part of meat and also as con- tained in pr ocessed foods, in par t because of the r elation with cardiovascular disease. See chapter 4.5.Other animal foods 383CHAPTER 12 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Personal recommendation The points here are additional to those made in the footnotes to the recommendation above. People who regularly eat red meat to consume less than 500 g (18 oz) a week, very little if any to be processed This recommendation relates to the goal above. In popula- tions where most people consume less than 500 g (18 oz) a week, the population average is likely to correspond to no more than roughly 300 g (11 oz) a week. Guidance There are many ways to enjoy meat and other animal foods as part of plant-based diets. For those who eat flesh foods, the amount of red meat con- sumed can be limited by choosing poultry and fish instead.It is better also to consume the lean parts of r ed meat. It is best that processed meats are avoided. They are gen- erally ener gy-dense and can also contain high levels of salt (see recommendation 7). They also tend to be preserved by smoking, curing, or salting, or with the addition of chemi-cal preservatives. Some of these methods of preservation areknown to generate carcinogens; while the epidemiologicalevidence that these are causes of cancer is limited, it is a wiseprecaution to avoid them. Processed meat includes ham, bacon , pastrami, and salami. Sausages, nitrates/nitrites or other preservatives are added, ar e also pr ocessed meats. Minced meats sometimes, but not always, fall inside this definition if they are preserved chemically. The same point applies to 'hamburgers'. Freshmeats that have simply been minced or gr ound and then shaped and cooked are not considered to be 'processed'. Substantial amounts of meat are not needed to sustain adequate consumption of protein and iron. All flesh foodsare high in protein, and for people who consume varied dietswithout any flesh foods, mor e than adequate protein can be derived fr om a mixtur e of pulses (legumes) and cereals (grains). Ir on is pr esent in many plant foods, as well as in meat. RECOMMENDATION 6 ALCOHOLIC DRINKS Limit alcoholic drinks1 PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL Proportion of the population drinking more than the recommended limits to be reduced by one third every 10 years1 2 PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION If alcoholic drinks are consumed, limit consumption to no more than two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women1 2 3 1This recommendation takes into account that there is a likely protective effect for cor onar y hear t disease 2Children and pregnant women not to consume alcoholic drinks 3One 'drink' contains about 10-15 grams of ethanol Evidence The evidence that all types of alcoholic drink ar e a cause of a number of cancers is now stronger than it was in the mid-1990s. The evidence that alcoholic drinks are a cause of cancers of the mouth, phar ynx, and lar ynx, oesophagus, and br east (pre- and postmenopausal) is convincing. The evidence that alcoholic drinks are a cause of colorectal cancer in men isconvincing. Alcoholic drinks are a probable cause of livercancer, and of colorectal cancer in women. It is unlikely thatalcoholic drinks have a substantial adverse effect on the riskof kidney cancer . Also see chapter 4.8. Justification The evidence on cancer justifies a recommendation not to drink alcoholic drinks. Other evidence shows that modestamounts of alcoholic drinks are likely to reduce risk of coro-nary heart disease. The evidence does not show a clear level of consumption of alcoholic drinks below which there is no increase in risk ofthe cancers it causes. This means that, based solely on the evidence on cancer, even small amounts of alcoholic drinks should be avoided. Further details of evidence and judge-ments can be found in Chapter 4. In framing the recom- mendation here, the Panel has also taken into account the evidence that modest amounts of alcoholic drinks ar e likely to pr otect against cor onary heart disease, as described in Chapter 10. The evidence shows that all alcoholic drinks have the same effect. Data do not suggest any significant differ ence 384PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS depending on the type of drink. This recommendation there- fore covers all alcoholic drinks, whether beers, wines, spir- its (liquors), or other alcoholic drinks. The important factor is the amount of ethanol consumed. The Panel emphasises that children and pregnant women should not consume alcoholic drinks. Public health goal The points here are additional to those made in the footnotes to the goal above. Proportion of the population drinking more than the recommended limits to be reduced by one third every 10 years The context for this goal, which like the others specified here is designed as a guide for national and other population poli- cies, is the current common rise in regular and heavy con- sumption of alcoholic drinks, including among youngpeople. The focus of the goal is especially on those con - suming above the recommended limits, rather than regular modest drink ers. Again as above, the goal pr oposes a time- frame. Achievement of this goal requires substantial support from regulatory authorities, the manufacturers of alcoholicdrinks, and from the owners of bars and other locationswhere alcoholic drinks are sold and consumed. Policy-makersare encouraged to frame goals according to their specificcircumstances. Personal recommendation The points her e are additional to those made in the footnotes to the recommendation above. If alcoholic drinks ar e consumed, limit consumption to no more than two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women Modest consumption of alcoholic drinks has been shown to be pr otective against coronary heart disease compared to no drinking, with higher levels of drinking in some cases show - ing incr eased risk. Nevertheless, no authoritative body has made specific recommendations for alcohol consumption to avoid coronary heart disease because of the adverse biolog-ical, behavioural, physical, social, and other effects of high - er levels of consumption. For those who do consume alcoholic drinks, no mor e than two drinks per day (men) and no mor e than one drink per day (women) are the recommended limits. These limits are expressed as amounts per day, because occasional heavydrinking (say , at week ends) while at other times alcoholic drinks are not consumed, is particularly likely to lead to adverse outcomes. Guidance For those people who choose to consume alcoholic drinks, the P anel endorses the advice of other authoritative bodies. These generally advise an upper limit of around two drinks per day for men and one for women. RECOMMENDATION 7 PRESERVATION, PROCESSING, PREPARATION Limit consumption of salt1 Avoid mouldy cereals (grains) or pulses (legumes) PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS Population average consumption of salt from all sources to be less than 5 g (2 g of sodium) a day Proportion of the population consuming more than 6 g of salt (2.4 g of sodium) a day to be halved every 10 years Minimise exposure to aflatoxins from mouldy cereals (grains) or pulses (legumes) PERSONAL RECOMMENDA TIONS Avoid salt-preserved, salted, or salty foods; preserve foods without using salt1 Limit consumption of processed foods with added salt to ensur e an intake of less than 6 g (2.4 g sodium) a day Do not eat mouldy cereals (grains) or pulses (legumes) 1Methods of preservation that do not or need not use salt include refrigeration, freezing, drying, bottling, canning, and fermentation Evidence Some methods of food preservation, processing, and prepa- ration affect the risk of cancer. The strongest evidence con-cerns pr ocessed meats, preserved by salting, smoking, pickling, addition of chemicals, and other methods (see r ec- ommendation 5, above); salt fr om all sour ces; and salt-pre- served foods. Salt and salt-pr eserved foods are probably a cause of stom- ach cancer: see chapter 4.6. The P anel judges that r efrigeration , while not lik ely to have any direct effect on the risk of cancer, indirectly protects against some cancers because it affects consumption of foodswhich themselves influence the risk of cancer . For instance, it may increase the availability and nutrient content of fresh, perishable foods (vegetables and fruits; meat; milk; seechapters 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4); and decrease the need for processed foods (preserved by salting, smoking, curing, and pickling; see chapters 4.3 and 4.9). Also see r ecommenda- tions 4 and 5, and bo x 4.6.4 in chapter 4.6. Some plant foods, notably cereals (grains) and pulses (legumes), may be contaminated with aflatoxins, producedby moulds (fungi) during storage in hot and humid condi - 385CHAPTER 12 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS tions. The evidence that aflatoxins are a cause of liver can- cer is convincing. Also see chapter 4.1. Justification The strongest evidence on methods of food preservation, processing, and preparation shows that salt and salt-pre-served foods are probably a cause of stomach cancer, and that foods contaminated with aflatoxins are a cause of livercancer. Salt is necessary for human health and life itself, but at lev- els very much lower than those typically consumed in most parts of the world. At the levels found not only in high- income countries but also in those where traditional diets arehigh in salt, consumption of salty foods, salted foods, andsalt itself, is too high. The critical factor is the overall amountof salt. Microbial contamination of foods and drinks and of water supplies, remains a major public health problem worldwide.Specifically , the contamination of cer eals (grains) and puls - es (legumes) with aflatoxins, produced by some moulds when such foods ar e stor ed for too long in warm tempera - tures is an important public health problem, and not only in tropical countries. Salt and salt-preserved foods are a probable cause of some cancers. Aflatoxins are a convincing cause of liver cancer.Further details of evidence and judgements can be found inChapter 4. Public health goals The points her e are additional to those made in the footnotes to the goal above. Population average consumption of salt fr om all sources to be less than 5 g (2 g of sodium) a day Proportion of the population consuming more than 6 g of salt (2.4 g of sodium) a day to be halved every 10 years The r eason for these link ed goals, which like the others spec- ified above ar e designed as a guide for national and other population policies, is the very high consumption of salt in most countries. Again as above, one of the goals proposes atime-frame. This time-frame implies a continuing effort into the future to achieve levels that might seem difficult within a single decade. Its achievement implies support fr om regu- latory authorities and fr om the manufactur ers of salty and salted foods. Policy-makers are encouraged to frame goals according to their specific circumstances. Minimise exposure to aflatoxins from mouldy cereals (grains) or pulses (legumes) Personal recommendations The points her e are additional to those made in the footnotes to the r ecommendations above. Avoid salt-preserved, salted, or salty foods; preserve foods without using saltLimit consumption of processed foods with added salt to ensure an intake of less than 6 g (2.4 g sodium) a day For most people, these two linked recommendations are designed to reduce salt consumption substantially. Usually most salt in diets is contained in processed foods. Some such foods are obviously salty. Others, bread for example, usual- ly do not taste salty, but bread and other cereal products are a major source of salt in high-income countries, togetherwith many other industrially processed foods that may not appear 'salty'. When preserving foods at home, methods that minimise use of salt are recommended. Avoid the use of salt at table. Do not eat mouldy cereals (grains) or pulses (legumes) The prudent approach is to avoid consumption of any cere- als (grains) or pulses (legumes) that may have been stored Most methods of food preservation, processing, and preparation are not the subject of goals or recommendations. Some of these are of public interest and some are mentioned here. Drying, fermenting, canning, bottling. There is no good evidence that these methods of food preservation in themselves have anyeffect on the risk of cancer. When they do not involve the use ofsalt, they ar e preferable to methods that do add salt. See chap - ter 4.9. Refrigeration. The epidemiological evidence associating use of refrigeration with reduction of the risk of stomach cancer is sub- stantial. The pr evious report judged this evidence to be convinc- ing. The Panel r esponsible for this Repor t judged that the ef fect of refrigeration as such on cancer risk was not likely to be dir ect- ly causative. Never theless, the benefits of industrial and domes- tic fr eezing, r efrigeration, and chilling include availability of perishable foods, including vegetables and fruits, all year round,protection against microbial contamination, and reduced need topreserve food by salting. In these respects, refrigeration is bene- ficial. Also see box 4.6.4 in chapter 4.6. Additives, contaminants. There is little epidemiological evidence on any r elationship between food additives and contaminants, whose use is subject to regulation, and the risk of cancer. Also seechapter 4.9. Steaming, boiling, stewing, baking, roasting, frying, grilling (broil- ing), barbecuing (charbroiling). While evidence suggesting that grilled (broiled) and barbecued (charbroiled) animal foods are a cause of stomach cancer is limited, there is evidence from exper-imental settings showing that carcinogens are formed when meats, animal foods, and some other foods ar e cooked at ver y high temperatures, and most of all when they are exposed to direct flame. While the epidemiological evidence that these are causes of cancer is limited, it is a wise pr ecaution to avoid foods cooked in this way. This effect is not found when foods are cookedby use of boiling water. Also see chapter 4.9.Other methods of pr eser vation and preparation 386PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS for a relatively long time in warm, ambient temperatures, even if they show no visible signs of mould. Guidance At all stages in the food chain, from production to purchase and storage ready for food preparation, prefer methods offood preservation, processing, and preparation that keep perishable foods relatively fresh, and that do not involve theuse of salt. Salt is just one way to add savour to foods. Many herbs and spices can be used instead. After a period of time of limit- ing the use of salt, taste sensitivity to it increases, preference decreases, and the natural savour of food becomes apparent.Food labels give some guidance. Products advertised as'reduced salt' may still be high in salt. Keep food fresh by use of refrigeration. Discard food show- ing signs of mould (other than those such as some cheeses manufactured by use of benign moulds). RECOMMENDATION 8 DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS Aim to meet nutritional needs through diet alone1 PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL Maximise the proportion of the population achieving nutritional adequacy without dietary supplements PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION Dietary supplements are not recommended for cancer prevention 1This may not always be feasible. In some situations of illness or dietary inadequacy, supplements may be valuable Evidence Randomised controlled trials have produced strong evidence that high-dose supplements of some nutrients modify therisk of some cancers. The evidence that high-dose beta-carotene supplements are a cause of lung cancer in smok ers is convincing. Calcium probably protects against cancers of the colorectum. Selenium in high doses probably protects against prostatecancer . It is unlik ely that beta-car otene, or foods fortified with this constituent, have a substantial effect on the risk of cancers of the prostate or skin (non-melanoma). Also seechapters 4.2 and 4.10. Justification The evidence shows that high-dose nutrient supplements can be pr otective or can cause cancer . The studies that demonstrate such effects do not relate to widespread use among the general population, in whom the balance of risksand benefits cannot confidently be pr edicted. A general rec- ommendation to consume supplements for cancer preven- tion might have unexpected adverse effects. Incr easing the consumption of the r elevant nutrients thr ough the usual diet is preferred. The r ecommendations of this R eport, in common with its general approach, are food based. Vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients are assessed in the context of the foods anddrinks that contain them. The Panel judges that the best source of nourishment is foods and drinks, not dietary sup- plements. Ther e is evidence that high-dose dietary supple- ments can modify the risk of some cancers. Although somestudies in specific, usually high-risk, groups have shown evi- dence of cancer prevention from some supplements, thisfinding may not apply to the general population . Their level 387CHAPTER 12 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS of benefit may be different, and there may be unexpected and uncommon adverse effects. Therefore it is unwise to rec- ommend widespread supplement use as a means of cancer prevention. Further details of evidence and judgements canbe found in Chapter 4. In general, for otherwise healthy people, inadequacy of intake of nutrients is best resolved by nutrient-dense diets and not by supplements, as these do not increase consump- tion of other potentially beneficial food constituents. The Panel recognises that there are situations when supplements are advisable. See box 12.4. Public health goal The points here are additional to that in the footnote above. Maximise the proportion of the population achieving nutritional adequacy without dietary supplements In many parts of the world, nutritional inadequacy is endem- ic. In cases of crisis, it is necessar y to supply supplements of nutrients to such populations or to fortify food to ensure at least minimum adequacy of nutritional status. The best approach is to protect or improve local food systems so that they are nutritionally adequate. The same applies in high-income countries, where impoverished communities andfamilies, vulnerable people including those living alone, theelderly, and the chronically ill or infirm, are also liable to beconsuming nutritionally inadequate diets. In such cases of immediate need, supplementation is necessary. See box 12.4. Personal recommendation The points here are additional to that in the footnote above. Dietary supplements are not recommended for cancer prevention This recommendation applies to self-administration of low (physiological) as well as high (pharmacological) doses of supplements, unless on the advice of a qualified health pro- fessional who can assess potential risks and benefits. Guidance Choose nutrient-rich foods and drinks instead of dietary sup- plements. This can be done by following all the recommendations made her e, in the context of appr opriate general r ecom - mendations on food, nutrition, physical activity, and body composition , designed to pr otect against disease and to pr o- mote health and well-being. The Panel judges that the use of supplements as possible pro- tection against colorectal and prostate cancer should not be rou-tinely recommended. In general, as alr eady stated, with secure food supplies and access to a variety of foods and drinks, when people follow therecommendations here in the context of general dietary rec- ommendations, supplements are normally unnecessary.Furthermore, in diets, nutrients are present in combinations often not found in 'multi'-supplements, and with other bioac- tive substances. The Panel recognises , however, that dietary supplements, in addition to varied diets, may at times be beneficial for specificpopulation groups. Examples include vitamin B12 for people over the age of 50 who have dif ficulty absorbing naturally occur - ring vitamin B12, folic acid supplements for women who may become or are pregnant, and vitamin D supplements for peo- ple who are not exposed to sufficient sunlight or some people (such as the elderly or people with dark skin) who do not syn-thesise adequate vitamin D from sunlight. The Panel advises against self-administration of supplements as protection against specific cancers. The findings on calcium and selenium apply in specific settings and specific doses. A r ecom - mendation for routine consumption in the general population might show a different balance of risks and benefits. Advice for individuals whose par ticular cir cumstances have been assessed is best given in a clinical setting in consultation with an appro- priately qualified professional. Box 12.4 When supplements ar e advisable388PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS This recommendation has a special significance. While derived from the evidence on being breastfed, it also indi- cates that policies and actions designed to prevent cancer need to be directed throughout the whole life course, fromthe beginning of life. Public health goal The points here are additional to those made in the footnotes to the goal above. The majority of mothers to breastfeed exclusively, for six months Sustained, exclusive breastfeeding was the norm until the development and marketing of infant formulas, which large-ly replaced breastfeeding in high-income and then in mostcountries by the second half of the 20 thcentury. While the practice of breastfeeding and exclusive breast- feeding has been increasing in many countries in recentdecades, in most countries now only a minority of mothers exclusively breastfeed their babies until four months, and aneven smaller number until six months. This is the context for this goal, which like the others spec- ified here, is designed as a guide for national and otherpopulation policies. It does not imply that in any populationwhere over half of all mothers breastfeed exclusively for six months that the ultimate goal has been reached: thegreater the proportion, the better. Its achievement will requir e increased support from regulatory authorities and from the manufacturers of infant formulas. Policy-makers are encouraged to frame goals accor ding to their specific circumstances. The Panel emphasises the importance of exclusive breast- feeding (other than vitamin dr ops wher e locally r ecom - mended), with no other sustenance, including water. There are special situations where breastfeeding is rec- ommended with caution or is not advised. The main specialsituation is when mothers have HIV/AIDS. On this, the UNGlobal Strategy as r evised in late 2006 states: 'Exclusive breastfeeding is r ecommended for HIV-infected women for the first six months of life unless r eplacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe for them and their infants before that time.' Personal recommendation The points her e are additional to those made in the footnotes to the r ecommendations above. Aim to breastfeed infants exclusively up to six months and continue with complementary feeding thereafter This and the population goal are references to the UN Global Strategy on Infant and Young Child Feeding, which is endorsed by the P anel. None of the phrasing of the goals and recommendations her e is designed to modify the Strategy , which allows for special circumstances, including those in which mothers are not able to breastfeed their babies or mayother wise be well advised not to do so . SPECIAL RECOMMENDATION 1 BREASTFEEDING Mothers to breastfeed; children to be breastfed1 PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL The majority of mothers to breastfeed exclusively, for six months23 PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION Aim to breastfeed infants exclusively2 up to six months and continue with complementary feeding thereafter3 1Breastfeeding protects both mother and child 2'Exclusively' means human milk only, with no other food or drink, including water 3In accor dance with the UN Global Strategy on Infant and Young Child Feeding Evidence The evidence on cancer supports the evidence on well-being, positive health, and prevention of other diseases: at thebeginning of life, human milk is best. The evidence that lactation protects the mother against breast cancer at all ages is convincing. Ther e is limited evi - dence suggesting that lactation protects the mother against cancer of the ovary. Having been breastfed probably protectschildr en against over weight and obesity , and ther efore those cancers for which weight gain, overweight, and obesity are a cause. Overweight and obesity in children tend to trackinto adult life. Also see recommendation 1 and chapters 6.3,7.10, and 8. Justification The evidence on cancer as well as other diseases shows that sustained, exclusive breastfeeding is protective for the moth-er as well as the child. This is the first major report concerned with the prevention of cancer to mak e a recommendation specifically on breast- feeding, to pr event br east cancer in mothers, and to pr event overweight and obesity in children. Further details of evi- dence and judgements can be found in Chapters 6 and 8. Other benefits of br eastfeeding for mothers and their chil - dren are well known. Breastfeeding protects against infec- tions in infancy, protects the development of the immatureimmune system, protects against other childhood diseases, and is vital for the development of the bond between moth- er and child. It has many other benefits. Br eastfeeding is espe- cially vital in parts of the world wher e water supplies ar e not safe and where impoverished families do not readily have the money to buy infant formula and other infant and youngchild foods. 389CHAPTER 12 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Guidance On breastfeeding, the Panel endorses the UN Global Strategy on Infant and Young Child Feeding. It is universally agreed, by UN agencies, national govern- ments, health professionals, civil society organisations, and the infant formula and milk industries, that human milk is the best food for infants and young children. Therefore, this Report recommends that mothers breastfeed exclusively, forsix months, as recommended in the Strategy. SPECIAL RECOMMENDATION 2 CANCER SURVIVORS1 Follow the recommendations for cancer prevention2 RECOMMENDATIONS All cancer survivors3to receive nutritional care from an appropriately trained professional If able to do so, and unless otherwise advised, aim to follow the recommendations for diet, healthy weight, and physical activity2 1Cancer survivors are people who are living with a diagnosis of cancer, including those who have recovered from the disease 2This recommendation does not apply to those who are undergoing active treatment, subject to the qualifications in the text 3This includes all cancer survivors, before, during, and after active treatment Evidence The available evidence on cancer survivors has limitations. It is of variable quality; it is difficult to interpret; and it hasnot yet produced impressive results. The evidence for thisreview does not include the active treatment period. The term 'cancer survivor' denotes people in a very wide range of cir cumstances. It is unlik ely that specific r ecom - mendations based on evidence applying to any one group of people would apply to all cancer survivors. In no case is the evidence specifically on cancer sur vivors clear enough to make any firm judgements or recommen- dations that apply to cancer survivors as a whole, or to thosewho are survivors of any specific cancer. Justification Subject to the qualifications made her e, the P anel has agr eed that its r ecommendations apply also to cancer survivors. There may be specific situations where this advice may not apply, for instance, where treatment has compromised gas-trointestinal function. If possible, when appr opriate, and unless advised other wise by a qualified pr ofessional, the r ecommendations of this Report also apply to cancer survivors. The Panel has made this judgement based on its examination of the evidence,including that specifically on cancer sur vivors, and also on its collective knowledge of the pathology of cancer and its interactions with food, nutrition, physical activity, and bodycomposition. In no case is the evidence specifically on can- cer survivors clear enough to make any firm judgements or recommendations to cancer survivors. Further details of evi- dence and judgements can be found in Chapter 9. Treatment for many cancers is increasingly successful, and so cancer survivors increasingly are living long enough todevelop new primar y cancers or other chr onic diseases. The390PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS recommendations in this Report would also be expected to reduce risk of those conditions, and so can also be recom- mended on that account. Recommendations In the special circumstances of cancer survivors, who until they have recovered from the disease are in a clinical setting, the Panel decided not to separate public health goals and per- sonal recommendations. The points here are additional tothose made in the footnotes above. All cancer survivors to receive nutritional care from an appropriately trained professional The circumstances of cancer survivors vary greatly. Given the increased importance of food, nutrition, physical activity, andbody composition in cancer survival, people who have received a diagnosis of cancer should consult an appropri- ately trained health professional as soon as possible. Theadvice r eceived will be designed to tak e their personal situ - ation and circumstances into account. People who ar e under going sur gical, chemical, or radio - therapy for cancer are likely to have special nutritional requirements; as are people after treatment whose ability toconsume or metabolise food has been altered by treatment;and people in the later stages of cancer whose immediateneed is to arrest or slow down weight loss. These are all clin-ical situations wher e the advice of an appropriately trained health pr ofessional is essential. The evidence does not support the use of high-dose sup- plements of micr oconstituents as a means of impr oving out - come. Cancer survivors should consult their physician and/or a qualified nutrition professional, who can evaluate the safe-ty and efficacy of specific dietar y supplements, and counsel appropriate action based on current research relevant to their particular clinical situation. All cancer survivors to aim to follow the recommendations for diet, healthy weight, and physical activity This general appr oach is for cancer sur vivors who are able, and have not been advised otherwise, to follow the recom- mendations of this Report. There is growing evidence that physical activity and other measures that control weight may help to prevent cancer recurr ence, particularly breast cancer. These findings are in line with the r ecommendations of this R eport. Cancer sur - vivors are also likely to gain health benefit, and a sense of control, from regular physical activity at levels that they cansustain . Guidance The general purpose of the recommendations made in this Report is to 'stop cancer before it starts'. Crucial support will be given to cancer sur vivors who decide to follow the over- all recommendations made in this chapter , when the people living closest to them also make this choice. As well as giv- ing crucial support and improving the quality of life of thecancer sur vivor , they will also be r educing their own risk of cancer. 391CHAPTER 12 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS Those responsible for reports such as this are faced with a number of challenges. Information, even from high-income countries where most research is carried out, isincomplete and often patchy, and that from many countries is fragmentary. Most modern research in the nutritional and other biological sciences is highly focused.Many researchers address not just what foods affect therisk of disease, but what specific agent or agents in thefood are responsible, or the exact biological pathwayinvolved. The amount of data produced by such studies is multiplying and its sheer volume can obscure the general view needed as a basis for public health goals andpersonal r ecommendations. As a result, until relatively recently, expert reports concerned with the pr evention of disease tended to frame their conclusions and recommendations in terms ofspecific dietary constituents being the most relevantfactors modifying the risk of disease. Thus, since the1960s, reports concerned with prevention of coronaryheart disease have recommended cuts in consumption ofsaturated fats and of dietary cholester ol. Such recommendations, while staying closer to the science as usually carried out, and of value to planners of foodsupplies and in the formulation of manufactur ed food, ar e less effective as ways of encouraging healthy choices of foods and drinks. People consume foods and drinks, ratherthan nutrients. Also, what people eat and drink and how they behave are only partly a matter of choice. Many other factors areinvolved including income, climate, and culture. Althoughfood supplies are now becoming increasingly globalised,the people of South India ar e not likely to move to meat- based diets, nor will most people in the USA adopt lentilsas staple foods. More recently, some reports have adopted a food-based approach to the prevention of disease and the promotionof well-being. This has pr esented the expert panels responsible for reports such as this one with another challenge. This is to r eview , assess, and judge the evidence in ways that r espect its natur e, yet at the same time also seek to discern 'the bigger picture'. A further challenge is to identify healthy patterns of food, nutrition, and physical activity that allow for \u2014 indeed encourage \u2014 the diversity both of traditional and modern food systems and cuisines. 12.3.1 The integrated approach Since its work began, five years before publication of this Report, the Panel has used a broad, integrative approach. This, while largely derived from conventional 'reductionist' research, has sought to find patterns of consumption of foods and drinks, degrees of physical activity, and scale of body composition that lead to recommendations designed to pre-vent cancer at personal and population levels. This approach has proved to work. As recommendation 2 indicates, meticulous examination of the many studies on physical activity and the risk of cancer shows that all types of activity \u2014 occupational, transport, domestic, recreational \u2014do or may pr otect against some cancers. The type of activity is evidently unimportant. Given the general tendency of pop- ulations living in industrialised and urbanised societies to become increasingly sedentary, this enables clear recommen- dations designed to encourage increased levels of physicalactivity. At a more detailed level, the same point applies to alco- holic drinks, as indicated in recommendation 6. Many stud-ies have been undertak en to examine the relationship of beer, wine, and spirits (liquor) to the risk of cancer \u2014 and to other diseases. Taken all together, these show that it is alcoholicdrinks in general \u2014 which is to say , the amount of ethanol consumed \u2014 that are or may be a cause of some cancers. Again, this enables the framing of clear recommendationsthat tak e into account the effect of modest amounts of alco - holic drinks on the risk of coronary heart disease. Recommendations 3, 4, and 5 also show how the inte- grated approach stays with the science and, by looking forpatterns, can create broad public and personal health mes-sages. After particularly car eful discussions, the Panel agreed that a k ey factor determining vulnerability to weight gain , overweight, and obesity , and thus to those cancers whose risk is increased in these ways, is not so much specific foods, drinks, or nutrients, but the relative energy density of diets.This is not an obvious conclusion fr om the studies whose results form the basis for this judgement. Up to now, epi- demiologists have rar ely used ener gy density as a concept in the design of their studies. Comparably, the vast amount of evidence on specific foods and drinks does indeed show a more general pattern withvegetables and fruits, and with r ed and pr ocessed meat. In framing recommendations 4 and 5, the Panel agreed that rec- ommendations on these types of food should be seen in thebroader context of plant and animal foods. This is not a new conclusion. Plant-based diets, which is to say diets within which foods of plant origin ar e more central than is typical in industrialised and urbanised settings, ar e now common - ly recognised as protective against some cancers. Again, the judgement requires qualification, as has been done in thefootnotes and text. Many foods of animal origin ar e nour -12.3 Patterns of food, nutrition, and physical activity 392PART 3 RECOMMENDATIONS ishing, and only the evidence on red meat and on processed meat is strong enough to justify specific recommendations. Nevertheless, with such precautions, the Panel has agreed that dietary patterns in which foods of plant origin are more central, with red meat less so, are protective. 12.3.2 Nutritional patterns The recommendations made in this Report do not specify every major type of food and drink. In this sense they donot, taken together, amount to whole diets. Nevertheless, combined with the text that accompanies them, they are likely to promote the nutritional adequacy of diets and healthy body composition. For this and other reasons, they will also be expected to help prevent nutritional deficien-cies and related infectious diseases. Thus, a diet based on these recommendations is likely to have modest fat content (through limiting energy-dense foods), especially in saturated fatty acids (limiting red and processed meat); to be relatively high in starch and fibre(from emphasis on r elatively unpr ocessed plant foods including cereals (grains)), while being low in sugar (due to limiting ener gy-dense foods and sugar y drinks). Overall, the macronutrient profile is likely to be similar to that rec- ommended in authoritative reports concerned more gener-ally with prevention of other chronic diseases. A number of the positive recommendations derive from evidence on foods that contribute various micronutrients to the diet. These, including relatively unprocessed cereals(grains), vegetables and fruits, and pulses (legumes), as well as various foods of animal origin, would be expected to sup- ply ample vitamin A (mostly in the form of carotenoids), folate, other B vitamins including vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, iron, zinc, potassium, and indeedsodium. 12.3.3 Integration with national recommendations In national settings, the recommendations of this Report will be best used in combination with recommendations issuedby governments or on behalf of nations, designed to preventchronic and other diseases. Also see box 12.5. In the Panel's judgement, based on its collective knowl- edge of food, nutrition, physical activity, and disease pre-vention , and also experience of national contexts, the recommendations here are likely to be harmonious with those designed to pr event disease in specific countries, which take local and national dietary patterns, food cultures, and social and other circumstances into account. Box 12.5 Regional and special circumstances The goals and recommendations specified in 12.2 are generally relevant worldwide. In thr ee cases, evidence that is str ong enough to be the basis for goals and rec- ommendations is of importance only in dis-crete geographical regions. That is not to say that if the same foods or drinks were consumed elsewher e they would not have the same ef fect, but rather that cur rently , people in the rest of the world do not con- sume them. These are the herbal drinkmat\u00e9, probably a cause of oesophageal can-cer; Cantonese-style salted fish, probably a cause of nasopharyngeal cancer; and cont- amination of water supplies with arsenic, a cause of lung cancer and (pr obably) skin cancer. The Panel considers that detailed goals and recommendations in these cases are most appr opriately set by local and/or regional regulatory authorities, other poli- cy-makers, and health pr ofessionals in the countries affected. Mat\u00e9 As stated in chapter 4.7 and elsewhere, mat\u00e9 is a herbal infusion originally culti-vated and drunk by the original inhabitantsin Ar gentina, Ur uguay , and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, wher e it is now adopted as a staple drink. Reports on the prevention of cancer have identified mat\u00e9 as a cause or possible cause of cancers of the oral cavityand oesophagus. The product is commonly available in supermarkets in many coun-tries, but the evidence shows that the causal factor is mat\u00e9 drunk very hot through a metal straw often left resting on the lip, theform traditional within Latin America. It is probable that the cause of cancer is not the herb but the ther mic ef fect. RECOMMENDATION Avoid consumption of mat\u00e9 as drunk in parts of Latin America, very hot and through a metal straw. Cantonese-style salted fish Cantonese-style salted fish, as stated in chapter 4.3 and elsewhere, is part of the traditional diet consumed by people living around the Pearl River Delta region in souther n China, and has been given to chil- dren, even as part of a weaning diet. This style of fish is prepared with less salt thanused on the northern Chinese littoral, is allowed to ferment, and so is eaten in adecomposed state. While it is also con-sumed by communities of emigrants fromthe Pearl River Delta in other countries, this particular preparation of fish is not other- wise an issue, and there is no good evidence that other forms of preserved fish affect the risk of cancer. RECOMMENDA TIONS Avoid consumption of Cantonese-style salted fish. Childr en not to eat this type of fish. Arsenic in water Contamination of water supplies with arsenic is a dif ferent type of special case. This may happen as a r esult of release of industrial ef fluents, and also because of geological and other envir onmental cir - cumstances. High concentrations of arsenic in drinking water have been found in areas of Bangladesh, China, and West Bengal (India); and also in more localised areas ofArgentina, Australia, Chile, Mexico, Taiwan, China, the USA, and V ietnam. Arsenic is classed as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. RECOMMENDA TIONS Avoid use of any source of water that may be contaminated with arsenic. Authorities to ensure that safe water supplies are available wher e such contamination occurs .393CHAPTER 12 PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AND PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS late 2008 will deal with the social and environmental fac- tors that influence the risk of cancer, with appropriate rec- ommendations. 12.3.4 General patterns The Panel has not been able to base its recommendations on general patterns of food and nutrition, as stated above, on evidence specifically directed towards that question. Reasonsfor this, as summarised in chapter 4.9, are that relatively few epidemiological studies examine diets in an integrated form; and of these, most do not define the nature of such diets in a way that can be compared with other studies. Those that do, such as studies of Seventh-day Adventists, often exam-ine the effects of whole ways of life, including factors that may confound findings specifically on food, nutrition, and physical activity. For the future, the Panel recommends that protocols be agreed to enable well conducted epidemiological studies tobe carried out on patterns of food, nutrition, and of physi-cal activity, using agreed definitions and methods that allowcomparisons and detailed analyses. A number of traditional and more modern food systems generate a variety of climatically and culturally appropriate,delicious, and nourishing cuisines that ar e harmonious with the recommendations made here. These include the many traditional cuisines of the Mediterranean littoral, and of South-East and East Asia, and some diets devised since the industrialisation and internationalisation of food systems.The latter are often adaptations of traditional diets, enjoyedby people in higher income countries as part of generallyhealthy ways of life. 12.3.5 Health, well-being, and ways of life Throughout our work we, the members of this Panel, have been awar e that pr evention of cancer thr ough changes to food and nutrition, physical activity, and body composition is a major global, regional, and national task; and also thatthis work is one part of a gr eater task, to pr event disease and to promote well-being throughout the world, sustainably and equitably. As part of this task, integrated and comprehensive pro- grammes should be developed on cancer prevention, togeth-er with pr evention of other chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, car diovascular diseases, osteopor osis, other chron- ic diseases, and also nutrient deficiencies and r elevant infec - tious diseases, especially of early childhood. This approach, broader than any now undertaken within the UN system,would need to be coor dinated by relevant international and national organisations. All reports on the pr evention of cancer must emphasise the fundamental importance of tobacco contr ol, as we do her e. The one habit that most unequivocally is a cause of cancer is smoking, and other use of and exposure to tobacco. Partlybecause of its addictive natur e, and for other r easons, tobac - co smoking is not a simple matter of personal choice. Its reduction requires vigilant commitment from governmentsand civil society at all levels. In general, ways of life \u2014 patterns of behaviour within societies \u2014 ar e never just personal matters. In this Report, we have concentrated our attention on nutritional and asso - ciated factors that affect the risk of cancer, and our goals and recommendations here for populations and for people areframed accor dingly .

In 2001, WCRF and AICR agr eed that it was time to com - mission a new report. Since the mid 1990s, the amount of scientific literatur eon this subject has dramatically increased. New methods of analysing and assessing evidence have been developed, facilitated by advances in electronictechnology. There is more evidence, in particular on over-weight and obesity and on physical activity. Examining food,nutrition, and physical activity in relation to cancer survivorsis a new field of study .The need for a new report was obvi- ous, and a multilevel pr ocess involving global collaboration was put in place. Commissioning this Report The goal of this second Report, Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity ,and the P revention of Cancer :aGlobal P erspective, has been to identify, review, and assess all the relevant research to date. It has used the most meticulous methodsfor assessment and review in order to generate a compre-hensive series of recommendations on food, nutrition, andphysical activity suitable for all societies and designed toreduce the risk of cancer .The process has also been devised as the basis for a continuous r eview that will k eep the evi- dence updated into the future. The process was organised into overlapping stages, designed to ensur eobjectivity and transparency as well as separation between the collection of evidence and the busi- ness of assessing and judging it. F irst, an expert task for ce developed a method for systematic r eview of the voluminous scientific literature. Second, research teams collected and reviewed the literature based upon this methodology. Third,an expert P anel assessed and judged this evidence and agreed recommendations. The results are published in this Report. The whole project has taken six years, with the launch and distribution of the second Report taking place in November 2007. Agreeing the methodology As a first stage, WCRF International developed an appro- priate method for collecting, synthesising, analysing, andreporting the evidence. In 2002, a Methodology Task Force of experts in nutrition, cancer, epidemiology, methodology,and statistics was convened. This Task Force drew on theaccumulated experience of existing techniques to develop a unique new process. The methodology is described in a Systematic Literature Review Specification Manual, which con- tains the instructions for conducting the systematic r eviews. The methods specified in the manual were tested at two centr es, one in the US Aand the other in the UK, and as a result the manual was modified. It has formed the basis of all the reviews of the literature on food, nutrition, physicalactivity, and the risk of cancer for all relevant cancer sitesand on weight gain, overweight, and obesity. Reviewing the literatur e WCRF International then invited scientific centr es to bid for the work of systematic literature review (SLR), and con- tracted with nine institutions in Eur ope and North America to conduct reviews of the literature on all cancer sites where evidence of links with food, nutrition, and associated factorswas alr eady appar ent, as well as that on determinants of overweight and obesity, and on authoritative reports con- cerned with other diseases. The project team from each centre included expertise in epidemiology, nutrition, cancer,mechanisms, statistics, and project management. Teams have been supported by a r eview coordinator \u2014 a member of the WCRF International Secr etariat. All r eviews have included the r elevant epidemiological and experimental literature. Using the specification manual to ensure a comprehensive and consistent appr oach to the analysis plus a common for- mat for displaying the evidence, each centre undertook one or mor eSLRs and pr oduced a report on the evidence for each cancer site. The r eports wer esubject to peer r eview both at the initial protocol stage and when the reports were sub- mitted in complete form. They were then revised beforebeing summarised and submitted to the P anel. The system - atic reviews present the findings of the review teams based on the agreed protocol. They stop short of assessing or judg-ing the strength and implications of the evidence. Judging the evidence The P anel of 21 experts was convened by WR CF International in 2003 to develop the second Report. Members of the Panel come from all the main continents andfrom 11 countries. Its collective expertise includes nutrition , Project process APPENDIX A397APPENDIX A PROJECT PROCESS cancer, obesity, other chronic diseases, physical activity, epi- demiology, biochemistry, statistics, public health, and pub-lic policy. The Panel includes members of the Panel from thefirst WCRF/AICR report and relevant World Health Organization expert consultations, as well as observers from the Methodology Task Force and the Mechanisms WorkingGroup and fr om six r elevant United Nations and other inter - national organisations. The Panel convened twice a year for three- or four -day meetings between 2003 and 2007. The Panel has been responsible for assessing the evidence from the SLRs, for agreeing judgements based on theirassessments, and for agreeing a comprehensive set of rec-ommendations. The Panel has also been responsible for iden-tifying issues arising from this work that would beappropriate topics for future research. For the next stage, the P anel, supplemented by addition- al expertise, examined the evidence on the determinants of dietar yand activity patterns, and of obesity ,and the effec - tiveness of interventions from personal to population level. Publication of this separate report is due in late 2008. Managing the project The second Report was commissioned by WCRF International and has been funded and published by WCRF/AICR. WCRFInternational set up a multilevel process to manage the pro- ject, and an Executive Team was established with the specif-ic responsibility of directing it. Executive Team: Executive body responsible for Report. Composed of WCRF International andAICR ex ecutives and advisors. Secretariat: Manages the whole report process. Advisor yGroup: Guides the Ex ecutive T eam and the Panel on policy and strategic and technical issues The Secretariat has included WCRF International staff in the UK, AICR staff in the USA, and consultants, including in thefollowing positions: Project Director: Overall responsibility for the report and its scientific content. Chair of Executive Team. Chief Editor: Responsible for editorial quality of the report. Chair of Advisor yGroup. Project Manager: Responsible for day-to-day management of the project; Chair ofSecretariat. Chapter Managers: Drive progress on chapters of the report. In addition to the work of pr oducing the second R eport, a Communications Strategy Group from within the WCRF global network was set up to be responsible for all aspectsof the pr omotion of the report before, during, and after its launch in November 2007. Keeping up to date This Report is meant to guide future scientific research, can- cer prevention education programmes, and health policyaround the world. It pr ovides a solid evidence base for pol - icy-makers, health professionals, researchers, and informed and interested people to draw on and work with. WCRF International has been mindful that the literature is continually expanding, and has commissioned a continu- ous r eview of the evidence. This process will be overseen by an expert panel convened by WCRF International, r esponsi - ble for assessing and judging the updated evidence as a basis for recommendations and action to prevent cancer world-wide. 398FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND THE PREVENTION OF CANCER: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE In September 1997, the World Cancer Research Fund and its affiliate in the USA, the American Institute for CancerResearch, jointly published Food, Nutrition and the Prevention ofCancer: a global perspective . On publication, this 670-page WCRF/AICR report, in its distinctive blue cover, and with its accompanying summary,was immediately r ecognised as the most authoritative and influential in its field. It became the standard text worldwide for policy-mak ers in government at all levels, for civil soci - ety and health professional organisations, and in teaching and research for centres of academic excellence. Responsibility for the first report and its conclusions and recommendations was taken by a panel of scientists con-vened by WCRF/AICR, chaired by Professor John Potter.Panel members came from Africa, Asia (India, China, Japan) and Latin America, as well as Eur ope and the US A. The col- lective knowledge of the panel included nutrition, cancer, other chr onic diseases, ener gy balance, epidemiology , biochemistry, toxicology, statistics, public health, and public policy. Official obser vers came fr om the W orld Health Organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UnitedNations, and the US National Cancer Institute. The Panel,supported by a WCRF Secretariat, held a series of seventhree-day meetings between 1993 and 1997. Special featur es The first report had a number of special features, adapted and developed in this second Report. All its findings wereintroduced and summarised in plain language, to make the science and its significance as clear and accessible as possi- ble. This facilitated its use as a tool for policy-mak ers at all levels fr om international government to municipalities, schools, and hospitals, as well as the standard basis for aca- demic teaching and practice. The panel r esponsible for the first r eport concluded that worldwide, around 4 million deaths each year are pre- ventable by adoption of its recommendations. Part of thepurpose of the report was to show that prevention of cancer by means of food, nutrition, and associated factors is as fea- sible and crucial as pr evention of coronary heart disease. Its recommendations tak einto account pr evention of other chronic diseases, and also prevention of nutritional defi- ciencies and food-related infectious diseases. The conclusions of the first r eport wer ebased on method -ical reviews of the epidemiological, experimental, and other relevant expert literature. The judgements of the panel werepresented in the form of matrices, adapted for this secondReport. This matrix approach, in which judgements such as 'convincing' and 'probable' were displayed according to com- mon specified criteria on the relative strength of evidence,was pioneer ed in the first WCRF/AICR r eport. The 14 recommendations of the 1997 report are food based. T aken together ,they amount to whole diets judged to give the best protection against cancer, other chronic dis- eases, and also other food-related diseases. The first reportalso included a chapter on the public policy implications ofits recommendations. As part of the second Report process,this aspect is the subject of a separate report to be publishedin late 2008. Impact and influence WCRF/AICR has a special commitment to ensur ethat the work for which it is responsible has a global impact and that its reports are placed in the right hands. Accordingly, over30000 copies of the first r eport and of its summar yhave been distributed throughout the world, to policy-makers in government, to health professional and civil society organi-sations, to scientists responsible for research and prevention,and to all other qualified and interested people. In addition ,the report and its summary have been trans- lated or adapted for a number of r egions and countries, including Latin America, China, Japan ,India, Germany , France, Italy, and the Asia-Pacific region. The report has had a powerful impact on cancer preven- tion at all levels. Governments and authoritative or ganisa- tions around the world use it to shape public health policy. The 2003 WHO r eport, Diet, Nutrition and the P revention of Chronic Diseases ,the scientific basis for the WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, adapted the methods pioneered by WCRF to classify the strength of sci-entific evidence and to display evidence-based judgements in the form of matrices. Research scientists use the first report as a basis for their work. Academics and public health educators use it as the pre-eminent textbook. Having set the agenda in its field, it is frequently cited in the academic and professional litera- tureand at international scientific confer ences. It has stim - ulated debate about how best to engage in a systematic and objective interpretation of the scientific data on food, nutri-tion,and the pr evention of cancer . The first WCRF/AICR Expert Report APPENDIX B399APPENDIX B THE FIRST WCRF/AICR EXPERT REPORT Directly, and also indirectly through its influence on pro- fessionals, it guides communities, families, and individualsthroughout the world as they make choices about their foodand nutrition, physical activity, and weight management. The report has also been used as the basis for the research, education, and associated programmes of the WCRF globalnetwork in the US A,the UK, the Netherlands, China (Hong Kong), and France, which together distribute tens of millions of br ochur es and newsletters each year to assist their sup - porters and to fulfil their missions. The first report laid solid foundations for this second Report, which has developed its methods and made use ofthe latest electronic technology in compiling, displaying, andassessing the evidence. The overall purpose of both reportshas been ,and will remain, that of WCRF and AICR: to pre- vent cancer ,worldwide. 400FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND THE PREVENTION OF CANCER: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE Since its foundation in 1982, the World Cancer Research Fund global network has been dedicated to the preventionof cancer. All the members of the global network have thesame mission: to prevent cancer worldwide. Cancer is a global disease. Some types of cancer are more common in the higher income countries of Europe, NorthAmerica, and elsewher e. Other types ar emorecommon in Africa and Asia and other lower-income parts of the world; and as shown in Chapter 1 of this R eport, these ar eamong the many compelling reasons why it is necessary to study cancer from a global perspective in order to understand howbest to prevent cancer in any one country. The WCRF global network consists of WCRF International and its member organisations. These are national charitiesbased in the US A, the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Hong Kong. Each member organisation is supported by donations from the public and is independent of government. Each is a sep - arate legal entity, responsible to its own board and account- able to the donors who support it. All member organisationsdetermine their own pr ogrammes, which ar edesigned to be most effective in national and local environments. Through national education and research programmes, a primary goalof the WCRF global network is to help promote changes thatwill decrease rates of cancer incidence. WCRF Internationalprovides each member with financial, operational, and sci- entific ser vices and support. Education The extensive education programmes of the global network encourage and enable individuals, families, and communi - ties to make healthy choices. Until 2007, these were based on the six Diet and Health Guidelines for Cancer P revention , developed fr om the r ecommendations made in the first expert report published in 1997 (see Appendix B). All the global network's education programmes reflect the most curr ent r esear chand the latest scientific agr eements. Aprime purpose of this second Report is to provide the basis for the WCRF global network's education programmes from2007. All network member organisations produce a wide variety of publications. Collectively ,these are the most extensive in their field. They include a quarterly newsletter ,booklets, brochures, and leaflets covering many themes, from the lat- est information on antioxidants to suggestions for the quickpreparation of healthy meals. The emphasis is on easy tipsand support for individuals and their families to adopt healthy ways of life. Public seminars and specific materialsfor dieticians, scientists, parents, and children all ensure thatrelevant information reaches these specific groups in appro- priate formats and language. National websites provide an immediate and interactive communication tool with the facility for nutrition hot lines, r ecipe corners, and daily tips, in addition to access to the wide range of educational materials. Research The global network funds research worldwide on the role of food, nutrition, physical activity, and associated factors in thecausation and prevention of cancer. There are two researchgrant pr ogrammes within the network. One is operated by WCRF International in L ondon; the other is based with the American Institute for Cancer Research, a member of the net- work, in W ashington ,DC. The pr ogrammes support epi - demiological studies and basic laboratory research. In 2007, the cumulative research funding by all members of the WCRFglobal network amounts to over $US 105 million ,support - ing almost 800 projects and involving over a thousand sci- entists from 23 countries. The research issues raised in Chapter 11 of this Report will be the basis for setting new research priorities for the glob-al network. Global impact In its first year in 1982, AICR, with the agreement of the US National Academy of Sciences, reprinted the pioneering NASreport on Diet, Nutrition and Cancer and distributed it to pol - icy-makers, opinion-formers, and health professionals throughout the US A. The findings and recommendations of the NAS r eport became the first basis for the education and other programmes of AICR. Following the foundation of WCRF in the UK in 1990, the decision was tak en to commission a new r eport with a glob - al perspective. This work took five years. The result was the first report, published by WCRF together with AICR in 1997(see Appendix B). With the development of the global net- work, the science in the field, and new understanding of the causes of cancer ,the decision was taken in 2001 to com- mission this second R eport, which has also been a five-year task. This Report will enable the global network to deliver the most current and reliable advice on food, nutrition, phys-ical activity ,body composition ,and associated factors, in The World Cancer Research Fund global networkAPPENDIX C401APPENDIX C THE WORLD CANCER RESEARCH FUND GLOBAL NETWORK order to reduce the risk of cancer. It replaces the 1997 report as the leading work of reference and basis for action in thefield, throughout the world. The global network is already committed to continue this work by continuous updating and evaluation of the scien- tific evidence. This commitment means that the network isnow able to offer the best and most r eliable advice now and also in the future. The global network is also pr oud of its work done in asso - ciation with United Nations and other authoritative inter- national and national organisations. This work is concernedwith the prevention of cancer, and also the prevention ofother diseases. The methods and findings of the first andnow this Report are offered as a basis for the work of otherorganisations that are also committed to the prevention of disease and the pr omotion of health and well-being, world - wide. Our membership World Cancer Research Fund International is the association that coor dinates the global network. The gr eatest impact can be achieved when allied organisations work together. Founded in 1999 and based in London and the USA, WCRFInternational maximises the potential of each member organ-isation, and strengthens their work. The commissioning andfunding of this R eport, and provision of the secretariat, is an example of all members of the global network combiningtogether .This has r equired collaboration on a global basis, in the interests of the network and all its members, and to further their joint mission. Founded in 1982, The American Institute for Cancer Research was the first organisation to focus exclusively on the link between diet and cancer ,and became the first member of the WCRF global network. L ocated in W ashington ,DC, AICR is now one of the largest cancer charities in the USA, funding scientific research and offering a wide range of edu-cation pr ogrammes. World Cancer Research Fund UK became the second mem- ber of the global network when it was established in 1990.Based in London, it is the UK's leading charity in the field of diet, nutrition, and cancer prevention, and is responsible for raising awar eness of the diet and cancer link among scien- tists, public health officials, media, and the general public. Wereld Kanker Onderzoek Fonds (WCRF NL) began work in 1994 in the Netherlands as the third member of the glob-al network. Based in Amster dam, it is the only Dutch char -ity specialising in cancer pr evention by means of food, nutri- tion,physical activity ,and associated factors, and has already made a major contribution to the acceptance of this message in the Netherlands. World Cancer Research Fund Hong Kong (WCRF HK) began work in 2002. As traditional Chinese diets have beenreplaced by mor ewestern diets, patterns of cancer incidence are changing. WCRF HK is playing a vital role, especially in working with government health departments in Hong Kong,to disseminate education and research programmes on can-cer prevention. Fonds Mondial de Recherche contre le Cancer (WCRF FR), founded in 2004, is the latest member of the WCRF globalnetwork. Based in P aris, WCRF FR is building its r esearch and education programmes, working with like-minded organisations to disseminate the vital information to helppeople to mak ehealthy choices and so reduce their risk of cancer. From its beginnings in the early 1980s, the WCRF global network has consistently been a pioneer and a leader ofresearch and education on food, nutrition, physical activity, and the prevention of cancer. The network has a special com-mitment to cr eation of the most r eliable science-based r ec- ommendations and their translation into messages that form the basis for action by professionals, communities, families,and individuals. This work is being done for these organisations in the USA, the UK, the Netherlands, F rance, and Hong Kong, and on behalf of people in all countries. The global network willremain one of the leaders of the international cancer pre- vention movement, in the broader context of better person-al and public health, worldwide. 402FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND THE PREVENTION OF CANCER: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE Terms here are defined in the context of this Report.

Cohor tstudy Astudy of a (usually lar ge) group of people whose characteristics ar erecorded at recruitment (and sometimes later), followedup for a period of time during whichoutcomes of interest are noted. Differences in the frequency of outcomes (such as disease) within the cohort are calculated in relation todifferent levels of exposure to factors of interest, for example smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and exercise.Differences in the likelihood of a par ticular outcome ar e presented as the relative risk comparing one level of exposur eto another (see box 3.4). Compliance The extent to which people such as study participants follow an allocated tr eatment programme. Computed tomography (CT) Aformof X-ray that pr oduces cr oss-sectional or other images of the body .Confidence interval (CI) Ameasure of the uncertainty in an estimate, usually reported as 95% confidence interval (CI), which is the range of values within which there is a 95% chance that the true value lies.For example the effect of smoking on the relative risk oflung cancer in one study may beexpressed as 10 (95% CI 5-15). This means that in this particular analysis, the estimate of the relative risk was calculated as 10, and that there is a 95% chance that the true value liesbetween 5 and 15. Confounder Avariable, within a specific epidemiological study ,that is associated with an exposur e,is also a risk factor for the disease, and is not in the causal pathway fr om the exposur eto the disease. If not adjusted for ,this factor may distor tthe appar ent exposur e-disease relationship. An example is that smoking is related both to cof fee drinking and to risk of lung cancer and thus, unless accounted for(contr olled) in studies, might make cof fee drinking appear falsely as a possible cause of lung cancer (see box 3.1).

Osteoporosis Loss of the tissues of bone (bone cells, mineral, and protein) to an extent that increases the risk of fracture. Oxidative damage Damage to cells or structures in cells caused by oxidation, either by chemicals or by radiation.Some oxidants are generated in the normal course of metabolism. Oxidation of DNAis one cause of mutation. p53 Aprotein central to regulation of cell growth. Mutations of the p53 gene are important causes of cancer (see oncogene and box 2.2).

Physical activity Any movement using skeletal muscles. Physical activity level (PAL) Energy expenditure per day as a multiple of basal metabolic rate (BMR) (see box 5.2). 408FOOD, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND THE PREVENTION OF CANCER: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE Physical activity ratio (PAR) The energy cost of an activity per minute divided by the energy cost of basal metabolic rate per minute. Thus, the energy cost of sitting at rest is about 1.2; for walkingat a normal pace, 4; and for jogging, 7. Phytochemicals Compounds found in plants not required for normal structure or function, which may modify physiological functions and influence health (see box 4.2.1). Point estimate Anestimate that is reported as a single value. The precision of a point estimate is indicated by the width of the confidence interval that surrounds it.

Pooled analysis (see pooling ) Pooling In epidemiology, a type of study where original individual-level data from two or more original studies are obtained, combined,and re-analysed. Positive energy balance (seeenergy balance ) Prebiotic Dietary carbohydrate that reaches the colon, where it promotes growth of beneficial bacterial flora (see box 4.10.2). Precursor Achemical compound from which another compound is formed.Processed meat Meat (usually red meat )preserved by smoking ,curing ,or salting, or by the addition of preservatives. Definitions vary between countries and studies as to whatprecisely is included (see box 4.3.1). Programming The process whereby events happening during fetal life (fetal programming), such as growth restriction, or in infancy can permanently affect the structure and function of particularorgans, and so also metabolic processes.Combined with other factors, this can in turn alter the response to environmental exposures and so susceptibility to disease. Promoter region The region of DNA in a gene which initiates the transcription of DNA to RNA when the enzyme RNA polymerase binds to it. Prostaglandins Arange of hormones derived from essential fatty acids .Among many other processes, they influence blood pressure and inflammation . Publication bias Abias in the overall balance of evidence in the published literature due to selectivepublication. Not all studies carried out are published, and those that are may differ from those that are not. Publication bias can betested for with either Begg's or Egger's tests . Randomised controlled trial (RCT) Astudy in which a comparison is made between one intervention (often a treatment or prevention strategy) and another (control).Sometimes the control group receives an inactive agent (a placebo). Groups are randomised to one intervention or the other,so that any difference in outcome between the two groups can be ascribed with confidence tothe intervention. Neither investigators nor subjects usually know to which condition they have been randomised; this is called 'double-blinding' (see box 3.4). RCT (see randomised controlled trial ) Reactive oxygen species Oxygen-containing radical or reactive ion that oxidises DNA (removes (OH-), hydrogen 2O2)or superoxide radical (O2-). Red meat Meat from domesticated cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats; not poultry and fish or meat fromwild animals. Refined sugars Sugars obtained by purification from plants which contain it, principally sugar cane orbeet.Relative risk (RR) The ratio of the rate of disease or death among people exposed to a factor, compared to the rate among the unexposed, usually used in cohort studies (see odds ratio ). Resting metabolic rate Metabolic rate in a fasting subject sitting quietly (also see basal metabolic rate ). Reverse causation The situation when an abnormal level of an exposure is caused by the cancer or its treatment, rather than the other way round. For example if cancer causes weight loss, then the finding that low BMIisassociated with increased risk may reflect weight loss due to cancer rather than low weight causing cancer. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) The molecule created by RNA polymerase from DNA(transcription )which carries the genetic message to ribosomes ( translation ),where proteins are made. Rickets Malformation of the bones in growing children due to deficiency of vitamin D. Inadults the equivalent is osteomalacia . RNA (see ribonucleic acid ) Salt iodisation The practice of fortifying salt with iodide as a means of ensuring adequate iodine intake. Satiation The development of fullness during eating that limits the size of a meal consumed (see satiety ). Satiety The suppression of appetite after eating that inhibits the starting of eating (see satiation ). Saturated fatty acids Fatty acids that do not contain any double bonds . Selection bias Bias arising fr om the pr ocedures used to select study participants and from factors influencing participation. Single bond Acovalent bond between two carbon atoms, each with two hydrogen atoms, for instance in saturated fatty acids . Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA sequence variation where a single nucleotide in the DNA is altered. SNPs accountfor 90% of all human genetic variation (see polymorphism and point mutation ). SLR (see systematic literature review ) 409GLOSSARY Smoking (foods) Smoking is the process of curing ,cooking, or seasoning food by exposing it for long periods of time to the smoke from a wood fire. 'Hot smoking' is a process that can be used to fullycook raw meats or fish, while 'cold smoking' isanhours- or days-long process that is generally used to preserve or flavour foods (usually meats or fish, but sometimes cheeses, vegetables, fruits). SNP (see single nucleotide polymorphism ) Socioeconomic status Acombined product of social and economic status reflecting education level, personal wealth, class, and associated factors. Solvent Substances (usually liquid) capable of dissolving or dispersing one or more other substances. Spontaneous physical activity (see non- exercise activity thermogenesis ) Squamous cell carcinoma Amalignant cancer derived from squamous epithelial cells. Stabiliser One of a number of food additives, such as agar or pectin (used in jam, for example), that give foods a firmer texture. While they are nottrue emulsifiers ,they help to stabilise emulsions. Statistical significance The probability that any observed result might not have occurred by chance. In most epidemiologic work, a study result whoseprobability is less than 5% (p < 0.05) is considered sufficiently unlikely to have occurred by chance to justify the designation'statistically significant' (see confidence interval ). Stem cell Acell that can self-renew or give rise to a lineage of mor edifferentiated cells. Sterilisation The destruction of bacteria or other microorganisms by heat, radiation, orchemical means. Steroid hormone One of several hormones derived from cholesterol and having a central effect on growth and metabolism. Supplement (see dietary supplement ) Systematic literature review (SLR) Ameans of compiling and assessing published evidence that addresses a scientific question with a predefined protocol and transparentmethods (see box 3.5). Testosterone An androgenic steroid hormone and the principal male sex hormone .Thermodynamics The branch of physics concerned with the study of energy and its conversion between different forms. Thermogenesis The process of heat production. In adults, arising from the metabolic processes during the digestion and assimilation of food and during shivering. Tocotrienol Aform of vitamin E.

It reflects the average amount of energy spentin a typical day, but may not be the exactamount of energy spent each and every day. Transcription Synthesis of RNAfrom DNAbythe enzyme RNA polymerase. Transition cultures Countries in the process of changing from one predominant social/cultural structure toanother, for instance moving from lower-income to higher-income status with the accompanying changes that this implies. Translation The process by which RNA carries the genetic message from DNA to generate proteins in the ribosome. Tumour suppressor gene Agene whose protein product inhibits tumour formation (see also oncogene and box 2.2). UICC International Union Against Cancer (www.uicc.org). Ulcerative colitis Adisease causing chronic inflammation of the large intestine (colon). Together with another disease of inflammation of theintestines called Cr ohn'sdisease, referred to as inflammator ybowel disease . Underwater weighing Amethod for estimating the proportions of body fat and lean mass.
