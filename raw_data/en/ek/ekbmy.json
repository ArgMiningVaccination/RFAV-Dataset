Essential oils are highly concentrated plant extracts that are obtained through distillation or cold pressing. They are called \"essential\" because they contain the essence of the plant from which they are derived, including its scent, flavor, and therapeutic properties. Essential oils have been used for thousands of years for their medicinal and therapeutic benefits. They can be used in a variety of ways, such as aromatherapy, topical application, and ingestion (although ingestion should only be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional). It's important to note that the effectiveness of essential oils can vary depending on individual factors such as the specific health condition being treated and the person's individual response to the oil. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before using essential oils, especially if you are pregnant, have a medical condition, or are taking medication. How to Use Essential Oils: Here are the ways we like to use Essential Oils: - Essential oils have a very small size and a chemical weight of less than 1,000m (m = weight of molecule). According to scientific testing, any substance with a molecular weight below 1,000m should be absorbed by the skin. This means that they are able to penetrate the skin and pass into the bloodstream and into different areas for internal therapeutic benefits. - There is great evidence that essential oils are absorbed into the bloodstream when inhaled. The large amount of blood vessels in the lungs absorb the oils and then circulate them throughout the body. Using a diffuser can help you experience the perks of these plant extractions. - Young Living Vitality oils are a line of essential oils that are specifically labeled for dietary use. They are designed to be used as a dietary supplement or to add flavor to food and drinks. The Vitality line includes a wide variety of oils, such as peppermint, lemon, and grapefruit, which can be added to water, tea, smoothies, or other foods and beverages. Oils like lemon and frankincense have great internal benefits and can be taken with water. Other essential oils like clove and oregano need to be diluted and shouldn't be taken internally for more than a week. Young Living Vitality oils are considered safe for ingestion when used as directed and can provide a convenient way to incorporate essential oils into your daily routine. However, it's important to note that not all essential oils are safe for ingestion, so it's important to follow the specific usage instructions for each oil and consult with a healthcare professional if you have any questions or concerns. - Essential oils are excellent choices to use for making homemade DIY personal care products. This is a great way to take advantage of essential oils to improve your beauty, home, and long-term health and to avoid the synthetic fragrances and ingredients in commercial products that contribute to the toxicity in your home and body.
