Engerix-B vaccine is used to help prevent hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is a liver disease that can cause mild illness lasting a few weeks, or it can lead to a serious, lifelong illness. Engerix-B vaccine helps your body develop immunity to the disease, but will not treat an active infection you already have. Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver that is spread through blood or bodily fluids, sexual contact or sharing IV drug needles with an infected person, or during childbirth when the mother is infected. Hepatitis causes inflammation of the liver, vomiting, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes). Hepatitis can lead to liver cancer, [cirrhosis](/cg/cirrhosis-of-the-liver.html), or death. Vaccination with Engerix-B is recommended for all adults who are at risk of getting hepatitis B. Like any vaccine, the hepatitis B vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person. Acute hepatitis B virus infection is a short-term illness that can lead to fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice (yellow skin or eyes, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements), and pain in the muscles, joints, and stomach. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the hepatitis B virus remains in a person's body. Most people who go on to develop chronic hepatitis B do not have symptoms, but it is still very serious and can lead to liver damage (cirrhosis), liver cancer, and death. Chronically infected people can spread hepatitis B virus to others, even if they do not feel or look sick themselves. Engerix-B side effects Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to Engerix-B: hives, difficult breathing, swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Keep track of all side effects you have. If you need a booster dose, you will need to tell the vaccination provider if the previous shot caused any side effects. Hepatitis B adult vaccine may cause serious side effects.

You can still receive a vaccine if you have a minor cold. In the case of a more severe illness with a [fever](/cg/fever-in-adults.html) or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving Engerix-B.
