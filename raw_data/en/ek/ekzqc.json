The Auth Method\u00ae of forearm massage, developed by Shari Auth, DACM, LMT, L.Ac., MA, demonstrates that by massaging with the forearms one can benefit from the advantages of this practice including more durability, more leverage, a larger surface area of contact and reduced wear and tear on the more fragile joints of the hands and wrist. Lauriann Greene, CEAS, Co-author of Save Your Hands! had this to say about the Auth Method\u00ae: Using the forearms instead of the hands is a great way to reduce stress to the hands, which are so overused in massage work. All massage therapists should learn the Auth Method\u00ae of forearm massage techniques to help protect and prolong their careers. Through text and video you will review how to massage the body in supine, prone and side lying position using the forearms. These techniques can be used for relaxing spa massage, deep tissue massage, medical and prenatal massage. The program also demonstrates Chi Gong (or Qi Gong) exercises for better body mechanics during massage.
