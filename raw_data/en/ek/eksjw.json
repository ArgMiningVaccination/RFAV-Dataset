The meeting was chaired by Dr Jean-Marc Oliv\u00e9 and opened by H.E. Dr Ferozud din Feroz, Minister of Public Health. In the context of the continuing transmission in Af ghanistan and the opportunity to interrupt transmission in the coming low transmission season, the meeting of the Afghanistan TAG was called with two key objectives: to review the p rogress in polio eradication activities, particularly in implementation of the national emer gency action plan (NEAP) 2015-2016 in past 6 months; and to make recommendations to achie ve the interruption of transmission by June 2016. The TAG expresses deep regret regarding the tragedy in Kandahar in which one polio worker lost her life in a horrific attack while wor king. The TAG observes that there is significant improvem ent in programme oversight, management and coordination through establishment o f national and regional emergency operations centres (EOCs), and there is a strong pa rtnership between government, United Nations agencies, and other partners. The TAG notes that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which form one epidemiological block, are the only remaining areas in the world infected with wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). There has been significant progress in the past few month s as evidenced by the reduced number of cases, especially in the Southern region, but trans mission continues particularly, but not exclusively in the Eastern region. The TAG notes that the deteriorating security situa tion and increased inaccessibility, particularly in Eastern and Northern regions, are a concern. The country has mechanisms in place to address inaccessibility which need to be c ontinually refined and adjusted - and assessed for impact -to address emerging challenges . TAG continues to urge the programme to maximize engagement with and use of external par tners, including in particular nongovernmental organizations implementing the basi c package of health services (BPHS). Despite some progress seen in Helmand, the quality of activity in the Southern region, particularly in Kandahar, remains suboptimal. Inter ventions for reducing missed children such as microplan validation, the revisit strategy, and the revision and implementation of the training curriculum for frontline workers have not been fully scaled up. The programme should seek to further disaggregate and analyse dat a on causes of missed children, in particular assessing individually the categories of 'sleeping', 'sick' and 'newborn' children. There is a mechanism for cross border coordination with Pakistan at national, regional and district levels but it needs to be strengthened , particularly in Eastern corridor. TAG appreciates that good quality surveillance is m aintained in most of areas, however low stool adequacy in two provinces of the Southern region is a concern. WHO-EM/POL/425/E Page 4 The TAG appreciates the country's achievements and the implementation status report on the recommendations of the previous meeting of t he TAG in June 2015. However, the TAG is concerned that implementation of some specif ic recommendations, particularly related to improvement of the quality of supplement ary immunization activities in accessible areas, has been slow. Key recommenda tions The national EOC should have a systematic weekly te leconference or videoconference with regional EOCs to track progress and provide fe edback and support in the implementation of the NEAP. Development and implementation of a clear and trans parent accountability framework needs to be accelerated. Full implementation of the NEAP 2015-16 should be e nsured and reviewed through monthly progress reports using the NEAP tracking da shboard. Intervention matrixes for low performing districts, as developed by the count ry, should be fully implemented. The country should initiate the process of developi ng the NEAP 2016-17 early enough to ensure that a draft NEAP is presented at the nex t TAG meeting. The TAG recommends fast-tracking thorough field val idation and revision of microplans for low performing districts priority 1 and 2 with integrated social components before the end of the first quarter of 2 016. The revisit strategy should be strengthened and exp anded to all five high-risk provinces by the March national immunization day campaign and the entire country before the next TAG meeting. The programme should conduct in-depth analysis of m issed children due to 'not available' and use the information to modify strate gies. Data on children missed should be disaggregated by 'refusals, newborn, sick, and s leeping', with each of the four as a distinct category of analysis to support developmen t of micro-strategies in response. The process of revising the training module for fro ntline workers and rolling it out should be fast-tracked by end of February and with preliminary assessment by end of March. Lot quality assurance sampling should be expanded t o all priority 1 and 2 low performing districts, where feasible, and those low performing districts where it is not possible to do so should be tracked. Intra-campaign data should be used to identify gaps and for corrective action in preparation for and du ring the subsequent campaign. For those low performing districts with continuing poor quality, simple district specific action plans should be developed and implemented to improve quality before the next campaign. The impact of the community health volunteer initia tive should be evaluated against traditional strategies. The pilot in Nangarhar shou ld be fully analysed and another pilot should be undertaken in a low performing district i n Southern region (possibly in Kandahar) to learn the lessons, challenges and impa ct in a different setting. If successful, expand the initiative in a phased manne r in prioritized persistently poor performing priority 1 districts for the May nationa l immunization days. WHO-EM/POL/425/E Page 5 Current programme activities and plans should be re viewed to maximize the engagement and contribution of external partners, i n particular those implementing the BPHS and other in-country nongovernmental organziat ions. The TAG recommends the implementation of area speci fic plans for the Eastern and Southern regions and for the rest of country by mid February, and reiterates that programme neutrality should not be compromised. Exp lore feasibility of, and where appropriate make plans for, delivering oral polio v accine (OPV) combined with other services (e.g. health camps) by the end of February , and measure impact on vaccine uptake. Robust preparations should be conducted for supplem entary immunization activities with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), with particul ar attention paid to having integrated microplans that incorporate social mobilization and fixed site locations, selection and training of vaccinators, social mobilization activi ties, monitoring, vaccine management, safe injection, surveillance for acute events follo wing immunization and safe disposal of waste. Coordination between the Eastern/South-eastern regi ons of Afghanistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan should be improved through bi-annual face-to-face meeting and fortnigh tly teleconferences at regional level. Low performing priority 1 and 2 districts of Afghan istan contiguous to Tier 1 and 2 districts in Pakistan should have stronger coordina tion at sub-district level with information sharing, risk management at micro-level and continued joint analysis of these areas. Urgent action needs to be taken to improve surveill ance in areas with low stool adequacy. Surveillance data should also be analysed by access status with the outcome shared with the TAG at its next meeting. Household and community engagement approaches shoul d be expanded in low performing priority 1 and 2 districts based on loca l issues. Every district should have an issue-specific monthly communication plan tracked b y the EOC, in place by end February. More focus should be placed on continuous communica tion approaches, including the work of the Immunization Communications Network whi ch goes beyond supplementary immunization activities allowing more time for pre- and post-campaign mobilization and missed children tracking and immun ization. The monitoring and evaluation platform should be strengthened to focus on measuring results of communications/social mobilization activities and p romoting accountability. Preparations for the switch to bivalent OPV (bOPV) should be monitored closely and the switch date synchronized with Pakistan. The polio legacy plan for Afghanistan should includ e a strong section on using the experience and infrastructure of polio to strengthe n the delivery of basic immunization services. A buffer stock of 2.3 million doses of bOPV should be replentished on a quarterly basis to accommodate related to the revision of microplan s, the needs of permanent transit teams, newly accessible areas and case response. WHO-EM/POL/425/E Page 6 1. INTRODUCTION The meeting of Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Po liomyelitis Eradication in Afghanistan was held 24-25 January 2016 in Kabul, A fghanistan. The meeting was attended by Dr Stanekzai, Senior Advisor to Minister of Publ ic Health, Dr Kakar, Presidential Polio Focal Point, members of the Afghanistan Polio Eradi cation Initiative (PEI) team from national and regional levels as well as representat ives from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Pr evention (CDC), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Kreditan stalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau and the Government of Canada, the last representing all bil ateral partners. The last meeting of the Afghanistan TAG was held on 1-2 June 2015 in Islama bad, Pakistan. There has been significant progress in polio eradic ation globally with a decrease in the number of cases from 359 in 2014 to 72 in 2015. Nig eria, one of the three polio endemic countries, was removed from the list of endemic cou ntries in September 2015. Three outbreaks of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), in the Horn of Africa, Middle East and Central Africa, were declared closed in 2015 following outb reak response assessment by an external team of experts. Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only two endemi c countries in the world. Pakistan has shown tremendous progress with significant reductio n in number of WPV1 cases from 306 to 53 whereas Afghanistan had 28 cases in 2014 and 19 cases in 2015. Although there was a significant reduction in number of cases in the Sou thern region in 2015, transmission spread from the south to the Western and Northern regions and the country witnessed a significant increase in number of cases in the Eastern region. Afghanistan experiences inherent challenges of inac cessibility and prevailing insecurity, which are further compounded by frequent population movement across the border with Pakistan. Continued spread of transmission across t he border poses a strong challenge as the two countries form one epidemiological block with t wo clearly defined zones, i.e. the Eastern region of Afghanistan with Khyber Pakhtunkh wa/Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FP/FATA) of Pakistan and the Southern region of Afghanistan with the Quetta block of Pakistan. Cross-border transmission in the Easte rn region is further aggravated by the number of inaccessible children which has increased 4.5-fold, with a total of 73 000 children unreached in the most recent campaign in December 2 015 (from 16 000 in November 2014). In its 12th meeting in October 2015 the Independent Monitoring Board on Poliomyelitis Eradication (IMB) concluded that \"The challenge for Afghanistan's programme is to clear the fog of doubt and dysfunction that is swirling aroun d it, as it too moves into the last low season. The establishment of a fully functioning em ergency operations centre is an essential first step and should happen immediately. Resolving ineffective inter-agency and government-partner working relationships is also a high priority. Polio will not disappear from the country without close and regular strategi c planning and implementation with neighbouring Pakistan.\" WHO-EM/POL/425/E Page 7 Since the last IMB meeting the management and coord ination of Afghanistan polio programme has gone through major restructuring incl uding establishment of national and regional emergency operations centres. The country has developed the national emergency action plan for polio eradication (NEAP) for July 2 015-2016 which, with its detailed work plans, provides the backbone for all polio eradicat ion activities to ensure interruption of transmission by June 2016. In the context of the continuing transmission in Af ghanistan and the opportunity to interrupt transmission in the coming low transmissi on season, the Afghanistan TAG meeting was called from 24 to 25 January with two key objec tives: to review the progress in polio eradication activit ies, particularly in implementation of the NEAP 2015-2016 in the past 6 months; and to make recommendations to achieve the interruption of transmission by June 2016. The meeting was chaired by Dr Jean-Marc Oliv\u00e9 and o pened by H.E. Dr Ferozuddin Feroz, Minister of Public Health in presence of the WHO an d UNICEF Representatives for Afghanistan. The list of participants is attached i n Annex 1. 2. SUMMARY O F DISCUSSIONS 2.1 G eneral conclusions The TAG expressed deep regret regarding the tragedy in Kandahar in which one polio worker lost her life in a horrific attack while wor king. The TAG acknowledges the extremely challenging situation in Afghanistan and appreciate s the hard work done by all involved in the programme. The TAG commends the leadership and active particip ation of national, regional and provincial government authorities and partners and participants from global partnership. It regrets the absence of some of partners who could n ot travel to Afghanistan due to security reasons. The TAG is pleased to observe a strong partnership between government, UNICEF and WHO in country at national and regional levels. Gov ernment and partners are commended for revamping programme management and coordination structures particularly the establishment of national and regional emergency op erations centres and the use of the national emergency action plan tracking dashboard t o monitor progress. However TAG notes that the agency surge staffing plan, particularly a t provincial and regional level is still not fully implemented. TAG is pleased to note that the country team is in process of developing and implementing an accountability framework. WHO-EM/POL/425/E Page 8 The TAG notes that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which form one epidemiological block, are the only remaining areas in the world infected with WPV1. There has been significant progress in past few months however it needs to be further enhanced to ensure transmission is interrupted by the end of this year (Fig. 1). Altho ugh progress is seen in the Southern region with reduced number of cases in 2015 compared to 20 14, transmission in Afghanistan has continued as evidenced by WPV cases in the east, so uth, west and north (Fig. 2) as well as in environmental samples. TAG notes that the deteriorating security situation and increased inaccessibility particularly in the Eastern and Northern regions, i s a concern and appreciates the effort of country to develop a systematic approach to reach t hese children (Fig. 3). WHO-EM/POL/425/E Page 9 The TAG appreciates that good quality surveillance is maintained in most areas, however low stool adequacy in two provinces of the Southern region is a concern (Fig. 4). The TAG appreciates that the country has clearly id entified gaps and outlined appropriate measures to improve surveillance at all levels. The TAG appreciates the strategies such as cross-border teams, permanent transit teams and spe cial nomadic teams as they are helping to reach children on the move. It encourages the count ry to continue strengthening implementation of these strategies (Fig. 5). The TAG appreciates the revised criteria for identi fication of low performing districts and plans for focused and prioritized interventions in these districts. It is encouraging to note that a microplan revision exercise combined with a revisit strategy has shown results where it has been fully implemented (Fig. 6). However, it is of concern that these initiatives ha ve not been scaled up despite recommendations made during the June 2015 TAG meeting. WHO-EM/POL/425/E Page 10 The TAG appreciates the significant improvement in quality of supplementary immunization activities in Helmand as seen in the r educed number of missed children. However, it expresses concern that high numbers of children are still being missed in accessible areas in Kandahar (Fig. 7). The TAG appreciates the innovations being tried by the country to reach missed children. However, it suggests that innovations suc h as the creation of community health volunteers (CHVs) should be fully tested in differe nt situations for impact and challenges prior to further scale-up in appropriate low-perfor ming districts. The TAG appreciates the efforts being made by the c ountry on reporting oral poliovaccine (OPV) utilization/wastage since the la st TAG. The TAG appreciates that supplementary immunization activities for inactivat ed poliovaccine (IPV) have been conducted and that the country has plans to expand into an additional 28 districts in the first quarter of 2016. The TAG also notes with concern that nongovernmenta l organizations are yet to be fully engaged and hopes recent efforts will help to engage them in a more systematic manner. The TAG appreciates the positive developments in cr oss border coordination but is concerned about delayed face-to-face at national le vel and suboptimal meetings in the eastern corridor. The TAG acknowledges the increased focus on househo ld and community engagement approaches to build further trust as an important a nd necessary addition to mass media activities. However, more emphasis must now be plac ed on expanding this work between campaigns and systematically monitoring activities to ensure they are having impact. The TAG appreciates country achievements and implem entation status report on the recommendations of the previous TAG meeting in June 2015. However, the TAG is concerned that implementation of some specific recommendation s, particularly related to improvement of the quality of supplementary immunization activitie s in accessible areas, has been slow. WHO-EM/POL/425/E Page 11 The TAG therefore makes the following conclusions. There is significant improvement in programme overs ight, management and coordination supported by a strengthening partnersh ip between government, UN agencies, and other partners. The deteriorating security situation in the country and increasing numbers of inaccessible children particularly in the Eastern r egion is a concern. The country has developed mechanisms to address inaccessibility tho ugh these need to be refined to address emerging challenges particularly in the eas t. Despite some progress seen in Helmand, the quality of overall programme activity in the Southern region, particularly in Kandahar, rema ins suboptimal. Interventions for reducing missed children such as microplan revision and validation, the long awaited introduction of a revisit strategy , and training for frontline workers under the newly revised curriculum have not been fu lly scaled up. There is a mechanism for cross border coordination with Pakistan at national level, regional and district levels. However, it needs to be further strengthened particularly in the eastern corridor. 2.2 Responses to questions fro m the country Is the 6-month plan presented, appropriate to achie ve interruption of polio transmission? The TAG recognizes the substantial progress made in the programme since the last TAG meeting, but believes that there is still space to strengthen programme fundamentals including improvement in the quality, consistency a nd analysis of programme data for missed children. This is related to the accuracy and detai l of microplans ensuring they are revised before each activity based on analysis of past aupp lementary immunization activity performance. Operational readiness needs to sustain ed and strengthened throughout the low transmission season even though little or no WPV ma y be seen during this period. Overall the TAG endorses the plan with the followin g modifications: prioritization of the activities so that they are i n sync with the national emergency action plan; focus on improvement of AFP surveillance rather tha n expansion of environmental surveillance - look to increasing the involvement o f private health facilities and traditional healers; and detailed preparation for IPV supplementary immuniza tion activities particularly social mobilization and vaccinators selection and training . What should the target age group be for cross borde r vaccination? All the cross border vaccinations should target chi ldren up to 10 years of age WHO-EM/POL/425/E Page 12 Is the plan to introduce the CH V approach in the Southern region and phased expans ion to poor performing priority 1 districts appropriate? The TAG endorses the CHV concept and encourages the programme to develop this strategy with some caveats. CHV should be viewed as a localized strategy for us e only in the poorest performing districts. Any new implementation/expansion of the CHV strateg y should be based on clear evidence of positive impact in low-performing areas like Kandahar, compared to the existing programme vaccinator model. CHV implementation should be based on clear and det ailed documentation of cadres eligible to be recruited, their operational role(s) , the management structure, and projections for sustainability, including financial sustainability models. Does the TAG endorse the plan presented for reachin g children in inaccessible areas? The TAG endorses the broad principles of the plan d escribed and suggests learning from experiences in countries facing access challen ges, e.g. Somalia The TAG also urges that adequate numbers of locally appropriate surge staff be urgently put in place to ensure implementation. 3. RECOMMENDATIONS Oversight, coordination and programme management 1. The national EOC should have systematic weekly tele conference or videoconference with regional EOCs to track progress and provide fe edback and support in implementation of the NEAP. National EOC members sh ould travel regularly to the regions and provinces to provide support. Provincia l polio coordination units should be established in the five high-risk provinces. 2. Government and partners should accelerate developme nt and implementation of a clear and transparent accountability framework including key measurable indicators and a system of tracking timely payment of vaccinators. T he country programme should look at the accountability framework of Pakistan and Nig eria and adapt as appropriate by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 3. Understanding the extreme difficulties of recruitin g staff in Afghanistan, partners should expedite recruitment as per the surge plan a nd build the capacity of newly engaged staff by the end of March 2016 to ensure ad equate staffing in low performing districts and regional and national levels. 4. Nongovernmental organizations should be systematica lly engaged in the polio programme, particularly for delivering polio vaccin e (in addition to other services as appropriate) in inaccessible and security compromis ed areas. All the nongovernmental organizations involved in delivering the basic pack age of health services (BPHS) should be engaged in intra-campaign monitoring as well as be part of regional EOCs and WHO-EM/POL/425/E Page 13 provincial polio coordination units; progress regar ding the engagement of nongovernmental organizations delivering the BPHS s hould be quantified and monitored. National emergency action plan 5. The TAG recommends that implementation of NEAP 2015 -2016 should be fast-tracked to ensure full implementation by the end of Februar y. The country should review progress made on a monthly basis using the develope d NEAP tracking dashboard and take timely corrective action. The programme needs to maintain a high level of vigilance and preparedness for responding to any WP V during low transmission season. 6. To avoid delay, the country should initiate the pro cess of developing NEAP 2016-2017 early enough to ensure that the draft NEAP is prese nted in next TAG meeting. 7. The intervention matrix for low performing district s as developed by the country should be fully implemented. A mechanism to track these in terventions should be developed and shared with TAG members on quarterly basis. Reaching missed children in accessible areas 8. Explore reasons for persistent poor performance in Kandahar by the end of February to inform revision of microplans, training and other i nterventions as appropriate. 9. The TAG recommends fast-tracking field validation a nd the revision of microplans to ensure that microplans for low performing districts priority 1 and 2 are revised on the basis of field validation findings before the end o f the first quarter of 2016. These plans should be fully integrated with social components. 10. Systematically strengthen implementation of migrant and mobile population strategy (including internally displaced) for vaccination as well as for surveillance activities. Nomadic vaccination strategy should target children up to 10 years of age. 11. Expand lot quality assurance sampling to all priori ty 1 and 2 low performing districts where feasible and track the low performing distric ts where it is not possible to do so. 12. After each campaign, supplementary immunization qua lity in all low performing priority 1 and 2 districts should be evaluated, and in those low performing districts with continuing poor quality, simple district specific a ction plans should be developed and implemented to seek to improve quality before the n ext campaign. 13. Intra-campaign data should be used to identify gaps and corrective action during the campaign. 14. The quality of post-campaign coverage assessment sh ould be reviewed and improved (with special emphasis on Kunar) before the March n ational immunization days campaign. 15. The revisit strategy is showing results; the strate gy should be strengthened and expanded to all five high-risk provinces by the Mar ch national immunization campaign and the entire country before the next TAG meeting. 16. The programme should conduct in-depth analysis of m issed children due to 'not available' and use the information to modify strate gies. Data on children missed should be disaggregated by 'refusals, newborn, sick, and s leeping', using each of the four types as a distinct category of analysis. WHO-EM/POL/425/E Page 14 17. Based on a previous recommendation, the TAG recomme nds that the process of revising the training module for frontline workers should be accelerated and it should be rolled out by the end of February. 18. The country should evaluate the impact of the CHV i nitiative as compared to traditional strategies. The initial pilot in Nangarhar needs to be fully reviewed to determine the impact of CHVs. A further pilot should be done in a low performing district in the Southern region (possibly Kandahar) to learn the le ssons, challenges and impact of the approach in a different setting. Equipped with thes e experiences (if successful), the country should plan to expand this strategy in a ph ased manner in prioritized persistently poor performing districts for the May national immunization campaigns. The CH V strategy should not be taken as an alternative to s trengthening existing campaign approaches including microplanning, training and th e revisit strategy. The implementation should be based on clear and detailed documentation of cadres eligible to be recruited, operational roles, management structure and project ions for sustainability. Reaching children in inaccessible areas 19. The TAG recommends the implementation of area speci fic plans for the Eastern, Southern and Northeast (Kunduz) regions, and for th e rest of country, by mid-February and reiterates that programme neutrality should not be compromised. The TAG also reiterates its earlier recommendation of expanding permanent polio teams in areas with access and security challenges. 20. The programme should explore the feasibility of, an d where appropriate make plans for, delivering OPV combined with other services (e.g. h ealth camps) by the end of February by engaging nongovernmental organizations, other sectors, line ministries, the private sector and elders. Supplementary immunization activities 21. The TAG endorses the OPV and IPV supplementary immu nization plans presented and recommends that the activities should be fully impl emented as per the planned schedule. Strong preparation for IPV supplementary immunization activities should be done with particular attention paid to having integ rated microplans (including social mobilization and fixed site locations), selection a nd training of vaccinators, social mobilization, monitoring including adverse events f ollowing immunization, vaccine management and safe disposal of waste. 22. The TAG requests the programme to develop a summary of experience of IPV use to date including lessons learned. Cross border coordination 23. Coordination should be improved between the east/so uth-east regions of Afghanistan and KP/FATA in Pakistan through quarterly videoconf erences between the Afghanistan and Pakistan national EOCs with bi-annual face-to-f ace meetings and fortnightly teleconferences at the regional level. National EOC s should monitor this. WHO-EM/POL/425/E Page 15 24. Low performing priority 1 and 2 districts in Afghan istan contiguous with tier 1 and 2 districts in Pakistan should be treated as a single entity for high focus interventions. They should have stronger coordination at subdistri ct level with information sharing, risk management at micro-level, shared communicatio n strategies and continuous joint analysis of these areas. Surveillance 25. The reasons for delayed stool collection should be analysed and action taken to improve surveillance in areas with low stool adequacy. Surv eillance data should also be analysed by access status and outcome shared with TAG in nex t meeting. Private sector and traditional healers should be systematically involv ed in the surveillance. The focus should be on improvement of AFP surveillance rather than expansion of environmental surveillance. Communication 26. Expand household and community engagement approache s in low performing priority 1 and 2 districts based on the local issues. Every di strict should have an issue-specific monthly communication plan in place by the end of F ebruary which is tracked by the EOC. 27. More focus should be placed on continuous communica tion approaches, including the work of the Immunization Communications Network whi ch goes beyond supplementary immunization activities allowing more time for pre- and post-campaign mobilization and missed children tracking/immunization. The monitori ng and evaluation platform should be focused more on measuring results and promoting accountability. Cold chain, switch and vaccine management 28. The programme should monitor the preparation and im plementation of the switch to bivalent OPV (bOPV) and synchronize the switch date with Pakistan. 29. Bi-annual inventory of cold chain for supplementary immunization activities should be conducted and monthly reports submitted on all vacc ine stock. 30. The TAG reiterates that a robust routine immunizati on system is critical to maintaining the progress achieved in eradicating polio, and urg es the government and partners implementing the BPHS to ensure high quality provis ion of immunization services. The polio legacy plan for Afghanistan should include a strong section on using the experience and infrastructure of polio to strengthen the deliv ery of basic immunization services. 31. Quarterly replenishment of a buffer stock of 2.3 mi llion vials of bOPV should be ensured to accommodate changing needs related to the revisi on of microplans, the needs of permanent transit teams, numbers of children in new ly accessible areas and case response. Next meeting of the TAG 32. The next meeting of the Afghanistan TAG is proposed to take place in Kabul, Afghanistan, during the week of 29 May 2016.
