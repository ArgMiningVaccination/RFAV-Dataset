It provides key inputs for policy formulation and appropriate programme interve ntions. HMIS is designed specifically to assist health departments, at all levels, in ma naging, planning, and monitoring and evaluation of the health programmes currently ru nning in the country. Considering the outdated software and hardware technologies of the existing HMIS portal and various technological requirements such as API, Real time d ynamic reporting, interactive dashboard etc., reva mping of the existing HMIS appl ication was felt need. Therefore, the HMIS 2.0 was developed and launched in 2020. 1.1 Journey of HMIS HMIS 1.0 started functioning from 2008-09 with District level r eporting. Gradually, facility level data entry initiated during 2011-12 and it was completed by 2016-17. Due to technological and programme need, HMIS revamping was initiated in 2019-20 and further launched in December 2020. The details Journey of HMIS is give n in Fig 1.1. Figure 1.1: Journey of HMIS 2008-09 HMIS Launched with District Level Reporting 2011-12 Facility level Reporting initiated 2016-17HMIS Augmentation (facilities Level reporting) 2019-20 Revamping of HMIS 2020-21 HMIS 2.0 Launched 5Health Management Information System (HMIS) 2.0 is a step towar ds digital transformation of health services delivery in the country. Duri ng 2016-17 and 2020-21, Digital India award also received for open data domain category . 1.2 Magnitude of Data Collection There are five types of formats available in HMIS to capture da ta from health facilities which include, Sub Centres (SCs), Primary Health Centres (PHCs) , Community Health Centres District Hosp itals (DHs) across the country. As of March 2022, there were around 747 districts and around 2.17 lakh health facilities mapped and reporting through HMIS Portal. 1.3 Key features of HMIS 2.0 Data Entry: x All types of public health facilities and private hospitals are mapped either as SC/PHC/CHC/SDH/DH and based on this mapping, set of data items for which data has to be filled are generated. x Person Specific User Credentials (mapped to an Individual) x Flexible: Data for multiple facilities can be entered through o ne credentials or one facility with one credential - as per requirement of the admini strative units of States x Compatibility with multiple devices (Mobile, Tab etc.) x The users can enter data regarding availability of infrastructu re and human resources at the facility only on ce in the system with an optio n to auto populate the same on a monthly basis. However, data can be edited as and when changes are required. x Inbuilt Consistency check for Data Quality i.e. inter-data vali dation, comparison with data reported in th e previous months etc. x Offline bulk upload options for health facilities having not so good internet connectivity x State -specific hierarchy was developed Integration with other Systems: x Linkage through API with other national level portal of Ministr y of Health & Family Welfare, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Tribal Affa irs etc. 6x State specific generic API for fe tching data from State MIS por tal (like PCTS portal of Rajasthan) Reporting: x Provisioning for real-time monitoring, Alerts, Analytics GIS In tegration with layers up to road, village boundary etc. x Data Visualization through GIS and Interactive Dashboard x Standard reports in public domain and real time reports in logi n available. Real time reports include data reporting status, all data items repo rt, Key HMIS report, Min-Max, Range report etc. 1.4 Data Captured in HMIS Data related to Service Delivery and Infrastructure/ Human Reso urce is captured in HMIS on monthly basis. Data for Service Delivery is to be entered every month by 5th of the following month. The data for Infrastructure/ Human Resource is also entered on monthly basis. Various modules for which data is captured in HMIS are a s follows: Service Delivery: x Maternal Health, Child-health & Immunization, Family Planning, x Vector Borne Disease, Tuberculosi s, Morbidity and Mortality, x OPD, IPD Services, Surgeries etc. Infrastructure: x Manpower, Equipment, x Cleanliness, Building, x Availability of Medical Services such as Surgery etc., x Super Specialties services such as Cardiology etc., x Diagnostics, x Para Medical and Clinical Services etc. 1.5 Health Facilities Status In all, there are around 2.17 lakh health facilities reported service delivery data on HMIS as on March 2022. All India distribution of health facilit ies by type is given in Figure 1.2. 7Figure 1.2: All India Mapping Distribution of Health Facilities by type of Formats The State/UT-wise breakup of P ublic Health Facilities by facili ty type as mapped in HMIS and Private Health Facilities by facility type as mapped in HMI S distribution as on 31st March 2022 are provided at Annexure-1.1 and Annexure-1.2 1.6 Categorization available in HMIS Facility Categories: As mentioned earlier in HMIS, the data is captured broadly on 5 types of formats i.e. SC, PHC, CHC, SDH and DH. However, o n ground there are many varied facility sub types or attributes to a facility for which demarcation is required. Accordingly, the following categorization is available on HMIS: 1. Services Category: 24X7, FRU, PPP, fully IPHS compliance, Other equivalent 2. Sub Facility Type: Medical College (For DH &SDH), & Health & Wellness Centre (For PHC & SC) 3.

Report: Under Health Sta tistics for RHS Report. 1.7 State Specific Hierarchies (Geographical) Although the HMIS system is LGD Compliant, i.e. it follows a st andard hierarchy as listed in LGD for State, District and Sub District, but as per the sta te's requirement, a provision has been created for incorporatin g state specific hierarchies b elow the level of sub district. The additional levels provided in HMIS are: 1. Urban Local Body (ULB) at Stat e as well as District Level 2. Health Block 3. Sub Division / Health Agency 4. City Town The details the generic structure of the State specific Hierarc hies is given below in Fig 1.3. Figue 1.3: Generic Structure of the State Specific Hierarchies 91.8 Reporting in Service Deliver y format by Public Health Facil ities Of 2.17 lakh health facilities, t here were around 99.8% reporti ng at all India level by all the health facilities for service delivery format. Only Delhi and Lakshadweep has a reporting below 90 percent in March 20222. The details of all States reporting of Service delivery is given at Fig 1.4. Figure 1.4: State/UT wise pe rcentage distribution of reporting of monthly Service Delivery data as on 31st March Assurance in HMIS Data quality is defined as the degree to which the data fulfill s its intended purpose. The volume of data, which HMIS generates, requires good Data qualit y assurance mechanism. Accordingly, a comprehensive Data Quality Assurance mechanism i s in place in HMIS. Ministry give top priority to quality of data coming into HMIS. Data reported in HMIS is expected to fulfill the various dimension of data quality. These dimensions include timeliness, completeness, consistent and cor rectness. To ensure timeliness, each facility is expected to enter the data by fift h day of the following month. HMIS has placed validation rules in data entry formats to ensur e data quality. There are some inbuilt data quality mechanism and some external data qual ity mechanism in place. i. Inbuilt Data Quality Assurance Mechanism The inbuilt data quality assurance mechanism in place includes following: a. Compare Option (available in data entry screen) b. Inter-Data Validation Checks (av ailable in data entry screen) a. Compare Option: HMIS has inbuilt features under which during th e time of data entry, data entry user can compare the entry of present month with tha t of previous month. That way they can observed any a dverted mistake or outlier data entry in the system. Screenshot of same is given below at Fig 1.5. Figure 1.5: Compare option in inbuilt data validation rules in place in its various data entry formats which restrict users from entering any garbage value in the system - some of the rules are 'mandatory' while the others are in terms of 'warning'. Mandatory validation rules are those which are having direct parent-child relations such as no . of 1st t r i m e s t e r registration of pregnant women cannot be greater that No. of AN C registration. A screenshot of the same is given below in Fig 1.6. Similar to th ese, there are some other mandatory validation rules inbuilt in HMIS. Figure 1.6: Inbuilt validation rules sample in place in HMIS ii. External Data Quality Assurance Mechanism The external data quality assurance mechanism, which includes reports such as min-max report, Real time data reporting status etc. through which comp leteness of reporting as well as any data quality related issues can be detected. In add ition, there is an automated tool developed through which data quality can assessed by the u sers. The tool is called as ADVTool. a. The ADVTool: Ministry in collaboration with National Institute of Medical Co llege, ICMR and Population Council developed an automated data quality tool as part of Nat ional Data Quality Forum 12(NDQF) support. The data quality thus developed tested and pilo ted. It is also available on HMIS portal also. The ADVTool is an automated system, is an effort in this direct ion to enable HMIS staff in faster review of errors and finalization of HMIS data. The s ystem will benefit the staff working at the national and sub-national levels to undertake da ta quality assessment checks and provide feedback to data entry operators at facility levels. iii. Training and Capacity Building: HMIS has a robust regular training and capacity building annual plan. One national and three to four regional workshops are held every year as per the plan. During 2020-21 and 2021-22, due to Covid-19 pandemic, number of virtual workshops were held where S t a t e s / U T s a n d D i s t r i c t s H M I S n o d a l w e r e o r i e n t e d o n H M I S. T h e s e w o r k s h o p s a r e organized to orient about new features and data definition. iv. Supportive Supervision: Supportive supervision and monitoring visits are important part o f d a t a q u a l i t y verification. During the field v isit random checks of HMIS data in the registers at facility level is undertaken. During Common Review Mission of National H ealth Mission HMIS data is extensively used during field visits. Population Resear ch Centre (PRCs) are also involved in the data verification exercise of the HMIS data. 13Annexure 1.1 State/UT-wise number of Public He alth Facilities by type of hea lth facility as mapped in HMIS (As on 31st March 2022) Sl.

This programme aimed at achieving a status in which women will be able to regulate their fertility, women will be able to go through their pregnan cy and child birth safely, the outcome of pregnancies will be successful and will lead to survival and well-being of the mother and the child. The couples will also be able to h ave their sexual relation free from fear of pregnancy and of contracting sexually transmi tted diseases. The second phase of RCH program i.e., RCH - II was launched on 1st April, 2005. The main objective of the program was to bring about a change in mainly three critical health indicators i.e., reducing total fertility rate, infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate with a view to realizing the outcomes envisioned in the Millennium Development Goals. RMNCH+A approach has been launches in 2013 and it essentially l ooks to address the major causes of mortality among women and children as well as t he delays in accessing and utilizing health care and services. Figure 2.1: The RMNCH+A strategic approach The RMNCH+A strategic approach h as been developed to provide an understanding of 'continuum of care' to ensure equal focus on various life stages. Priority interventions for each thematic area have been included in this to ensure that the linkages between them are contextualized to the same and consec utive life stage. It also introduces new initiatives like the use of Score Card to t rack the performance, National Iron + Initiative to address the issue of anaemia acro ss all age groups and 17the Comprehensive Screening and Early interventions for defects at birth, diseases and deficiencies among children and adolescents. The RMNCH+A appropriately directs the States to focus their eff orts on the most vulnerable population and disadvantaged groups in the country. It also emphasizes on the need to reinforce efforts in those poor performing distr icts that have already been identified as the high focus districts.

The World Health Organization defines maternal health as: \"The health of women during Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the postnatal Period.\" Maternal health also includes the absence of maternal morbidity , severe maternal morbidity, and maternal mortality. Maternal Morbidity refers to health conditions that complicate pregnancy and childbirth or that have a negative impact on a woman's health a nd well-being. Severe maternal morbidity (also called acute maternal morbidity) refers to outcomes of labor and birth that result in significant negative short- or long-term consequences to a woman's health. Maternal Mortality Death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its mana gement but not from accidental or incidental causes. Maternal health is an important aspect for the development of a ny country in terms of increasing equity and reducing poverty. The survival and wel lbeing of mothers is not only important in their own right but are also central to s olving large broader, economic, social and developmental challenges. Massive and stra tegic investments have been made under the Nationa l Health Mission for improvemen t of maternal health. The women who die are in the prime of life responsible for the health and wellbeing of their families. Their death represents a drain on all develo pment efforts. Above and beyond the social and economic rationale for preventing this bu rden of mortality and morbidity is moral imperative. Therefore, reducing the high maternal mortality in the developing world should be considered a key policy issue for he alth, social and economic development. STATISTICAL MEASURES OF MATERNAL MORTALITY Maternal mortality ratio (MMR): Number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100000 live births during the same time period. Maternal mortality rate (MMRate): Number of maternal deaths during a given time period divided by person -years lived by women of reproductive age (age 15- 49 years) in a population during the same time period. Adult lifetime risk of maternal death: The probability that a 15-year-old girl will eventually die from a maternal cause (4). The proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age t hat are due to maternal causes (proportion maternal; PM): The number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among women aged 15-49 years. 20One of the key indicators of maternal mortality is the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) which is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a giv en time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period. The target 3.1 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set by U nited Nations aims at reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births. It is heartening that the Maternal Mortality Ratio of India has declined over the years from 130 in 2014-16 to 97 in 2018-20, as indicated in the graph below. Figure 2.3: Showing Decline in Maternal Mortality in India. Source- SRS The Sustainable Development Goals and Maternal Mortality The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were launched on 25 Se ptember 2015 and came into force on 1 January 2016 for the 15-year period un til 31 December 2030. Among the 17 SDGs, the direct hea lth-related targ ets come under SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. With the adoption of the SDGs, the United Nations Member States extended the global commitments they had made in 2000 to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which covered the period until 2015. In the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), coun tries have united behind a new target to accelerate the decline of maternal morta lity by 2030. SDG 3 includes an ambitious target: \"reducing the global MMR to less than 70 per 100 000 births, with no country having a maternal mortality rate of mor e than twice the global average\". As per SRS (SPECIAL BULLETIN ON MATERNAL MORTALITY IN INDIA 201 8-20, released on November 22), Seven states have already achieved th e sustainable development goal target \u2014 Kerala (19), Maharashtra (33), Telang ana (43), Andhra Pradesh (45), Tamil Nadu (54), Jharkhand (56), and Gujarat (5), according to the data. (Annexure-2.1) Four key actions responsible for India's remarkable achievement are: First, India has made a concerted push to increase access to quality m aternal health services . Since 2005, coverage of essential maternal health services ha s doubled, MMR in INDIA 130 122 113 103 97 2014-16 2015-17 2016-18 2017-19 2018-20 21while the proportion of public faci lities have tripled, from 70.6% in 2008-09 to 95.5% in 2021-22 as per the HMIS Key Indica tor report for 2008- 09 and 2019-20) (including private facilities, institutional de liveries). Second, state-subsidized demand-side financing like the Janani Shishu S uraksha Karyakram - Pregnant women delivering in health institutions under the Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK) are entitled to absolutely fr ee/no expense delivery, including caesarean sections. The initiative stipulat es free diet drugs, diagnostics and blood, besides free transport from home to inst itution, or between facilities in case of a referral and drop back home. Similar en titlements have been put in place for ante-natal and post-natal complications during pre gnancy and all sick infants accessing public health institutions for treatment. (An nexure-2.2 & 2.3) The Janani Suraksha Yojana is a safe motherhood programme that provides cash assistance for delivery and post-delivery care under the Nation al Health Mission that aims to reduce maternal and neo-n atal mortality by promoting in stitutional delivery among the poor pregnant women. Figure 2.4: Percentage of JSSK beneficiaries to Total number of pregnant women registered for ANC in 2020-2021 & 2021-2022. Figure 2.5: Percentage of JSSK b eneficiaries to Total Number of public Institutional Deliveries conducted (Including C-Sections) 2020- 2021 & 2021-2022. Third, India has put significant emphasis on mitigating the social de terminants of maternal health. Women in India are more literate than ever, wi th 71.5% (Source: NFHS-5) now able to read and write. There is a drop in the overall rate of child 22marriages, from 26.8 per cent in the earlier National Family He alth Survey (NFHS-4) to 23.3 per cent in NFHS 5. These fa ctors alone have enabled Indian women to better control their reproductive lives and make decisions that reflec t their own interests and wants. Finally, the government has put in substantive efforts to facilitate po sitive engagement between public and private health care providers. Ca mpaigns such as the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan have been introduced with great impact, allowing women's easy access to a ntenatal check-ups, obstetric gynecologists and to track high-risk pregnancies - exactly what is needed to make further gains and achieve the SDG targets. Antenatal care (ANC): Human rights law includes fundamental commitments of states to enable women and adolescent girls to survive pregnancy and childbirth as part of their enjoyment of sexual and reproductive health and rights and living a life of dignity. The World Health Organization (WHO) envisions a world where \"every pregnant woma n and newborn receives quality care throughout the pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period\" There is evidence that effective interventions exist at reasona ble cost for the prevention or treatment of virtually all life-threatening mater nal complications , and almost two thirds of the global maternal and neonatal disease b urden could be alleviated through optimal adaptation and uptake of existing re search findings . But a human rights-based approach is n ot just about avoiding death an d morbidity - it is about enabling health and well-being while respecting dignity a nd rights. Definition- Antenatal care (ANC) can be defined as the care provided by sk illed health-care professionals to pregnant women and adolescent girl s in order to ensure the best health conditions for both mother and baby during preg nancy. The components of ANC include: x Risk identification; x Prevention and management of pregnancy-related or concurrent di seases; and x health education and health promotion. A proper antenatal check-up provides necessary care to the moth er and helps identify any complications of pregnancy such as anaemia, pre-eclampsia a nd hypertension etc. in the mother and slow/inadequat e growth of the foetus. Antenat al care allows for the timely management of complications through referral to an appro priate facility for further treatment. It also provi des opportunity to prepare a bi rth plan and identify the facility for delivery and referral in case of complication. Components of ANC: Quality ANC has several component s, which are described below: Section A: Primary Steps: x Early registration and first check-up is conducted within 12wee ks (first three months of pregnancy). 23x Track every pregnancy for conducting at least four antenatal ch eck-ups (including the first visit for registration), keeping in mind a ll the essential components listed under. Section B: x Administer two doses of Td injection. x Provide 180 tablets of IFA. Section C: Essential components of every antenatal check-up: x Patient's history taking. x Physical examination-measure the weight, blood pressure and res piratoryrate and check for pallor and oedema. x Abdominal palpation for foetal growth, foetal lie and auscultat ion of Foetal Heart Sound (FHS) according to the stage of pregnancy. x laboratory investigations, such as haemoglobin estimation and u rine tests (forsugar and proteins). Section D: Desirable components x Blood group, including the Rh factor. x The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL)/Rapid Plasma Re agin (RPR) test to rule out syphilis. x Test the woman for Human Immuno defi ciency Virus (HIV*). x Blood sugar. x Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) test. Section E: Counselling x Help the woman to plan and prepare for birth (birth preparedness/micro birth plan).This should include deciding on the place of delivery and the presence of an attendant at the time of the delivery. x Advantages of institutional deliveries and risks involved in ho me deliveries. x Advise the woman on where to go if an emergency arises, and how to arrange for transportation, money and bl ood donors in case of an emerge ncy. x Educate the woman and her family members on signs of labour an d danger signs of obstetric complications. x Emphasise the importance o f seeking ANC and PNC. x Advise on diet (nutrition) and rest. x Inform the woman about breastfeed ing, including exclusive breas tfeeding. x Provide information on sex during pregnancy. x Warn against domestic violence (explain the consequences of violence on a pregnant woman and her foetus). x Promote family planning. x Inform the woman about the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)/any ot her incentives offered by the state. ANC registration ANC registration means registering an antenatal or pregnant woman in a hospital. This ensures that you are having regular check-up during your pregnancy. 24Registration of a pregnant woman for ANC should take place as soon as the pregnancy is suspected. Every woman in the reproductive age group should be registered when pregnancy detect. Ideally, the first visit should take place wi thin 12 weeks. However, even if a woman comes for registration later in her pregnancy, she should be registered and care should be pro vided to her according to the gestational age. HMIS is capturing a series of data elements related to these as pects of Ante Natal care.To assess the extent of provision of services in any area, one of the benchmarks is to asses it against the Estimated/Expected beneficiaries. At National level, the total expected pregnant women for the year 2021-22 was 92.06%. (Annex ure:2.4) Figure 2.6: Coverage ANC Registration in India. Figure 2.7: Percentage of ANC Registered against Estimated Pregnancies: 2020-2021 Source: HMIS Report 2020-2021 2519 States have performed above th e National Average of 92% for ANC Registration with Puducherry reporting the highest ANC registration over est imated pregnancies. Whereas 18 States have reported values less than the National A verage of 92%. Figure 2.8 shows States/UTs performing b elow All India Average for Per centage ANC Registered to Estimated Pregnancies 2019-20. Number and timing of visits: Ensure that every pregnant woman makes at least four visits for ANC, including the first visit/registration. It should be emphasised that this is only a minimum requirement and that more visits may be necessary, depending on the woman's condition and needs. Early initiation of Antenatal care (ANC) The first visit or registration of a pregnant woman for ANC sho uld take place as soon as the pregnancy is suspected. Ideally, the first visit should take place in the first trimester, before or at the 12th week of pregnancy x Early registration of ANC within first 12 weeks of pregnancy ai ds early documentation of the woman's bas eline physiological and laborat ory parameters for subsequent compar ison, early detection of anomal ies with the progress of pregnancy, avoiding teratogens, provides opportunit ies for preventive health care's services such as immunization against neonatal tetanus, prophylaxis and treatme nt of diseases, diagnosis and t reatment of medical disorders. This also helps in providing the woman the o ption of an early abortion. It is important to find out as early as possible whet her the woman wants to go in for an abortion so that the procedure can be don e safely as per the legal provisions laid down under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1972. Early detection of pregnancy is important for the following re asons: x It facilitates proper planning and allows for adequate care to be provided during pregnancy for both the mother and the foetus. x Record the date of the Last Mens trual Period (LMP), and calcula te the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD). x The health status of the mother can be assessed and any medical illness that she might be suffering from can be detected and also to obtain/ record baseline information (on blood pressure, weight, haemoglobin, etc.) Help s in timely Suggested schedule for antenatal visits: xWithin 12 weeks\u2014preferably as soon as pregnancy is suspected\u2014fo r registration of pregnancy and first antenatal check-up x2nd visit: Between 14 and 26 weeks x3rd visit: Between 28 and 34 weeks x4th visit: Between 36 weeks and term 26detection of complications at an early stage and manages them a ppropriately by referral as and where required. Figure 2.8: Percentage of Early registration (within 12 weeks) of pregnancy to total Registration of ANC: Source: HMIS Report Increasing trend of early registration is observed as per the H MIS report. It is observed that in 2020-21 early registration percentage is only 78.3 wher eas 81.4 percentage in 21-22. This tells the success of the program at the ANC (WITHIN FIRST 12 WEEKS) 27Figure 2.9: Showing Comparison of Pregnant Women who had Antena tal Checkup in first trimester. 28PW received 4 or more ANC check-ups: The proportion of pregnant women receiving 4 or more antenatal care visits (ANC 4+) is used prominently as a global benchmark indicator to track ma ternal health program performance. Conventional ANC comprised about 12 visits (one visit each mont h during the first 6 months of pregnancy, once every 2-3 weeks for the next 2 months , and ANC 4+ has been the most frequently used summary measure of maternal healt h program performance. Receiving antenatal care at leas t four times increases the like lihood of receiving effective maternal health interventions during the antenatal pe riod. This is one of the indicators in the Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and A dolescents' Health (2016-2030) Monitoring Framework, and one of the tracer indicat ors of health services for the universal health coverage (SDG indicator 3.8.1). HMIS i s capturing ANC 4 + data since 2017-18. Figure 2.10: Showing Accending T rends of ANC Checkups 4 or more times during the Pregnancy. As per HMIS approximately 63.5% o f women receive four or more A NC in 2017-18 , in 2018-19 it is increased upto 73.3%, showing annual growth of 15 % and 9.3% of annual growth in 2019-20 however the HMIS data showing annual d ecrees (6.3%) of 4 or more ANC in 2020-21. The percentage of states of Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and Ma nipur with four or more antenatal check-ups is less than 50% in 2020-2021 and 2021 -2022.

Good quality of ANC helps in reducing the risk of stillbirths and pregnancy complic ations and give women a positive pregnancy experience. These quality indicators ensur e not only a healthy pregnancy for the woman and the baby, but also an effective tra nsition to positive childbirth and ultimately to a positive experience of motherhoo d. Tetanus toxoid vaccination: Tetanus is a disease that can be prevented by vaccines containing tetanus-toxoids. Antibodies produced by maternal immunization that pass to the f etus via the placenta protect the baby in terms of tetanus during the neonatal period . Elimination of maternal New-born Tetanus (MNT) has been defined as less than 1 NT case per 1000 live births in a specific region by the World Health Organizati on (WHO). MNT elimination strategies include v accination, hygienic practices at delivery, and surveillance. India was declared free of maternal and neonatal tetanus on 15th May, 2015. Unlike polio or small pox, tetanus can't be fully eradica ted as the tenacious spores of bacteria causing tetanus, clostridium tetani, are wid espread in the environment. The journey towards its elimination from India has not been easy, and sustained efforts will be required to maintain this status. HIMS captures the three indicators related to prevention of tet anus through tetanus vaccine coverage viz,: 1. Number of PW given TT1/Td1 2. Number of PW given TT2/ Td2 3. Number of PW given TT booster./TT booster. Figure 2.12 UIP schedule of Td vaccine during Pregnancy Source: Tetanus and adult diphthe ria (Td) Operational Guideline s, MOHFW The annual TT coverage rate in Pregnant women as per HMIS at al l India level is only 86.3% out of which 76 % coverag e is from Urban and 89% from r ural sector. 31The lowest TT coverage rate in pregnant women is found in Puduc herry 25%, Delhi 2.7) Figure 2.13: Showing TT coverage in India The dropout rate of TT1 from TT 2 in pregnant women at national level is 11.9% out of which 16% are from urban and 9 % from rural. Highest dropout s from TT1 to TT2 coverage is found in Nagaland (32%), followed Manipur (26%), Delhi (22%). 32Figure:2.14 Showing Dropouts of TT/Td vaccination during Pregna ncy. It is also observed that the coverage of TT in pregnant women o f India is better in the rural India as compared to the urban India. Maternal Anemia- Anemia has been recognized as the most common form of nutrition al deficiency worldwide. The overall iron requirement during pregnancy is sig nificantly greater than in the non-pregnant. Though anaemia is easily treatable and pre ventable disease, it continues to be significantly associated with pregnancy. The ph ysiological iron demand in pregnant women corresponds roughly to 1000-1200 mg for an av erage weight of 55 kg. Hemoglobin value <11 g/dL is def ined as anemia in pregnancy by WHO. Anemia in pregnancy can be further divided as: x Mild anemia : hemoglobin level 10.0-10.9 g/dL x Moderate anemia 7-9.9 g/dL x severe g/dL. 33 Who guideline estim x Compulsory by usi oto calorimeter. x At 14-16 weeks, 20-24 weeks, 26- 30 weeks and 30-34 weeks of pre gnancy in all pregnant women. x Minimum of 4 Hb estimation ; minimum 4 weeks apart. Figure 2.15: Percentage of Pregnant Woman tested for Hb 4 or more times for respective ANC . Prevalence of Anaemia in Pregnancy: At the national Level the preval ence anaemia in F.Y.20-21 is 67.9% & 70% in 2021- 22. In 2021-2022, highest prevalence of anemia found in o (97.5%), Himachal Puducherry and some north-eastern states have re corded a low p r e v a l e n c e a c r o s s c a t e g o r i e s , t h e s e s t a t e s h a v e a l s o w i t n e s s e d an increase in prevalence since F.Y. 19-20. 34Figure 2.16: Prevalence of Anaemia in Pregnancy. HMIS captures the two data eleme nts describing the severity of anaemia: 1. Number of PW having Hb level<11 (out of total tested cases)(7.1 to 10.9) 2. Number of PW having Hb level<7 (out of total tested cases) At national level in 2021-22, the Pregnant women falls in the category of mild anemia (10.9 to 7.1 gm% of Hb) are 95.5% and only 4.5% of the pregnant women have Hb less than 7 gm%. The State of Sikkim (13%) is having highest pe rcentage of pregnant women having Hb less than 7gm%, followed by Jammu & Kashmir (12 %) Telangana (8%), however the Stat e of Himachal Pradesh(0.6) is the lowest. 35Figure 2.17 Anemia prevalence by severity . Management of Anaemia at Institution: It is observed that at all India level only 65.56% of Pregnant women having severe anaemia (Hb<7) treated at institution to women having Hb level< 7 in 2021-2022 and 62% in 2020-2021.The Mizoram (18.8%), (35.5%) and Highest Jammu and Kashmir(98.9%), Maharashtra(97. 8%). 36Figure 2.18: Showing State wise coverage of treatment of Pregna nt woman having anemia (Hb<7). Anemia Mukt Bharat T o a c h i e v e t h e t a r g e t s o f W o r l d H e a l t h A s s e m b l y o f 5 0 % r e d u c t i o n of anemia in women of reproductive age by 2025 and POSHAN Abhiyan (2018-2022 ) to reduce the prevalence amongst young children (6-59 months), adolescents an d women of reproductive age groups (15-49 years) by three percent per year , Anemia Mukt Bharat has been designed. The operational guidelines were launched by Honorable Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi on 14th April, 2018 in Bijepur, Ch hatisgarh. The beneficiaries are children 6-59 months, children 5-9 years, ado lescent boys 10-19 y e a r s , a d o l e s c e n t g i r l s 1 0 - 1 9 y e a r s , w o m e n o f r e p r o d u c t i v e a g e (20-49 years), pregnant women and lactating women (0-6 months). 37Key interventions for Pregnant women in Anemia Mukat Bharat are: A Key intervention is to give IFA to pregnant women irrespectiv e of anemia under Anemia Mukat Bharat. Group Dose & regime Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers ( o f 0-6 months child) Daily, 1 Iron and Folic Acid tablet starting from the fourth month of pregnancy (that is from the second trimester), continued throughout pregnancy (minimum 180 days during pregnancy) a n d t o b e c o n t i n u e d f o r 1 8 0 d a y s , p o s t - partum Each tablet containing 60 mg elemental Iron + 500 mcg Folic Acid, sugar-coated and red-colour. Coverage of Iron Folic acid supplementation: HMIS captures the indicator for tracking of coverage of iron fo lic acid supplementation: Number of PW provided full Course 180 Iron Folic Acid (IFA) tab lets. At national level the coverage of Pregnant women provided full course 180 Iron fo lic acid is 92% in 2021-22 and 90% in 2020-21. The highest coverage found in S tate of Chhattisgarh (99.9%), Maharashtra (98.2%), of prophylactic 180 Iron Folic Ac id distributions to pregnant woman. 38Deworming during Pregnancy: WHO recommends periodic treatment with anthelminthic (deworming ) medicines, without previous individual diag nosis to all at-risk people liv ing in endemic It denes at-risk people as pre-sch ool-aged children, school-aged children, and women of childbearing age (including pregnant women in their second a nd third trimesters and lactating women. Considering the potential benets and high infestation load from the public health perspective, d eworming is recommended routine ly during pregnancy. Prophylactic dose and regime for deworming in India. Group Dose & Regime Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers (0-6 months) One d o s e o f 4 0 0 m g A l b e n d a z o l e ( 1 tablet), after the first trimester, preferably during the second trimester. Appropriate administration of antihelminthics results in curing t h e i n f e s t a t i o n o r lessening the intensity of worm burden, which benets both preg nant woman and communities by potentially improving the overall health and wel lbeing of these women and by reducing the number of eggs shed in the environment. As per HMIS report of FY 21-22 only 55.36 % of pregnant women g iven one tablet of albendazole after first trimester. Highest coverage found in th e State of Gujarat (87%) followed by Chhattisgarh(83.22%) The lowest Nagaland Figure 2.20: given one Albendazole tablet after 1st trimes ter: All India Hypertension is the most common medical problem encountered dur ing pregnancy, complicating 2-3% of pregnancies as per HMIS. Hypertensive pregnancy disorders cover a spectrum of conditions , including preeclampsia/eclampsia, gestational hypertension, chronic hyper tension, and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. Hypertensive p r e g n a n c y disorders complicate 10% of pregnancies and cause significant m aternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. 39 As per HMIS the national prevalence of Pregnancy induced hypert ension in 20-2021 is 2.17 % and 2021-2022 is 2.22%. However, Pregnancy induced hy pertension cases managed at institution in 2020-2021 is 71.9 and 71.5 in 2021-22 .

Undiagnosed o r inadequately treated GDM can lead to significant maternal & fetal complications. Mor eover, women with GDM and their offspring's are at increased risk of developing t ype 2 diabetes later in life. Consequences of GDM: Maternal risks of GDM include polyhydramnios, pre-eclampsia, pr olonged labour, obstructed labour, cesarean section, uterine atony, postpartum hemorrhage, infection and progression of retinopathy which are the leading global cau ses of maternal morbidity and mortality. Fetal risks include spontaneous abortion, intra-uterine death, stillbirth, congenital malformation, shoulder dystocia, b i r t h i n j u r i e s , n e o n a t a l h y p o g lycemia and infant Classification of Hypertension in Pregnancy Hypertension \u2014systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or more and/or diastolic bl ood pressure of 90 mmHg or more, on two consecutive readings taken four hours or more apart.

Lo n g t e r m c l i n i c a l e f f e c t s o f G D M are important contributors to the burden of non-co mmunicable diseases in many countrie s. National Guidelines on Diagnosis and Management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Government of India released a \"National Guidelines on Diagnosi s and Management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus\" in 2014 to address the need o f high prevalence of GDM in India. The initiatives led to integration of GDM diagnos is and management within ANC care package in public health system. Guidelines advocate for universal screening of all pregnant wom en at first antenatal contact. If the first test is negative, second test should be d one at 24-28 weeks of gestation. HMIS captures the Number of Pregnant woman tested for blood sugar using OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test).

Place of Delivery Home Delivery : A home birth is a birth that takes place in a residence rathe r than in a hospital or a birthing centre. Maternal delivery at home without skilled care at birth is a ma jor public health issue. Maternal death is a severe public health problem where home del ivery without skilled care at birth has a significant detrimental impact. Most import antly, as women are dying from preventable causes during childbirth, non-institutio nal or home delivery needs to be eliminated. Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG-3) targets: \"reducing the global MMR to less than 70 per 100,000 births, with no coun try having a maternal mortality rate of more than twic e the global average. In India 1067470 home delivery reported HMIS in 2020-21 and 922637 in 2021-22.

Keeping t his in view, it is essential that all mothers have access to a birth attendant, wh o has requisite midwifery skills to recognize complications, manage as per scope of pract ise and refer if needed. Government of India is committed to ensure universal coverage o f all births with skilled attendance both in the institution and at community level and t o provide access to emergency obstetric care services for women experiencing seriou s complications. To be called an SBA, the health workers (Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), Lady Health Visitors (LHVs) and Staff Nurses (SNs)) must possess technical competence related to routine care provision including identification and immediate m anagement of complications arising during pregnancy and childbirth. Figure 2.24: Showing Percentage of Home Deliveries attended by Skill Birth Attendant. Source: HMIS report. GoI considers an SBA to be a person who can handle common obste tric and neonatal emergencies and is able to timely detect and recognise when a situation reaches a point beyond his/her capability, and refers the woman/new-borns to an appropriate facility without delay. Out of total home deliveries only 18.5 % of home deliveries were attended by Skilled Birth Attendant in 2020-2021 and 20.5% in 2021-2022. (Annexure :2.10) C-Section deliveries in The caesarean section is a globally recognised maternal health- care indicator. Cesarean section (CS) when indicated is a live saving procedure but when performed without appropriate indications can add risk to both mother and baby. Unnecessary caesarean sections also pull resources away from other services in overloaded health system. 45Figure-2.25: Showing increasing trends of C- section deliveries in India as per NFHS report.

(Annexure:2.11) Comprehensive abortion care: Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy. It is defined as 't he intentional ending of a pregnancy', by the Cambridge Dictionary. Unsafe abortion is a preventable - cause of maternal deaths and morbidities. It can lead to physical and mental health complications and social and financial burdens for women, communities and health systems. (WHO, Key facts November 21) India was among the first countr ies to legalize abortion. Abort ion has been legal in India since 1971 under broad criteria, including economic or so cial necessity, rape, incest, fetal impairment or cont raceptive failure within marria ge. Comprehensive abortion care is included in the list of essentia l health care services published by WHO in 2020. Abortion is a simple health care inte rvention that can be effectively managed by a wide range of health workers using med ication or a surgical procedure.

However, several factors contribute to the inadequacy of access to public sector abortion services, including high proportions of public facilities lacking trained staff and necessary equipment and supplies. Based on the data reported on HMIS portal during 2020-21 and 2021-22, the abortion rate (Number of abortions to total ANC at all India level is 3. 9% and 4.1% respectively.

Therefore, it is important that women who decide t o get abortions can do so without unnecessary delays. In fact, 98.48% of all aborti ons in India are obtained within the first 12-13 we eks after the last menstrual period (LMP) (HMIS report 2021-22). Sometimes, however, women have compelling reas ons to obtain abortions in later weeks. While abortions at or after 13 we eks gestation comprise a minor ity (around 8.7%in 2020-21 & 10.09% in 2021-22) of the total abortions at Nationwi de as per HMIS reporting, they are responsible for the majority of serious abo rtion-related complications.

Source:HMIS report Post Abortion/ MTP Complications: MTP and spontaneous miscarriages, can lead to a variety of comp lications. Most complications are considered minor such as pain, bleeding, infe ction, and post- anesthesia complications. Others are major, including uterine a tony and subsequent hemorrhage, uterine perforation, injuries to adjacent organs (b ladder or bowels),cervical laceration, failed abortion, septic abortion, and disseminated intravascular fact sheet https://www.who.int/news-room/fact- sheets/detail/abortion ). 50 Showing All India of Post Abortion/MTP Complications identified Uttar Pradesh (9.0%) reported post Pradesh (7.7%) in 2021-22. Postnatal Care: (PNC) As per the World Health Organization, postpartum period or post natal period is defined as the period immediately following birth of the baby and extending for about 6 weeks. This period represents a critica l phase in determining the health and survival of the mother and her newborn. Most of the maternal and infant deaths occur in the 1st month after birth: \"Almost half of postnatal maternal deaths oc cur within the first 24 hour. According to the WHO (2015), the first 24h postpartum is the highest risk period for women and newborns. For both the mother and the infant, imm ediate postnatal care is important to treat complications, like postpartum infections, excessive bleeding, pain in the perineal area, vaginal discharge, etc., that arise from birth and to provide the mother with relevant information on caring for herself and her baby. The extent to which women receive such care is directly related to the len gth of their postpartum There are three major mechanisms by which abortion complication s can be classified. 1. Infection can be the result of a failure to exercise universal precautions prior to the procedure, such as hand washing, surgical glove use, proper ste rilization of the field, use of non-sterile instruments, as well as the presence of a pr e-existing infectious process in a patient such as cervicitis or endometritis. 2. Incomplete evacuation of the products of conception leads to th e collection of blood in the uterus, causing over distention and atony which results in hemorrhage. It can also lead to infection and possible sepsis. 3. Injury from the surgical procedure itself depends upon the method used and includes vaginal or cervical lacerations, as well as uterine, bowel, or bladder injury. 51stay. Postpartum length of stay after delivery has been identif ied as an essential quality indicator of woman care. Ensuring 48 hrs. stay in hospi tal during childbirth and through subsequent home visits on 3rd, 7th ,14,21,28, and 42nd days is the important c o m p o n e n t s f o r i d e n t i f i c a t i o n a n d m a n a g e m e n t o f e m e r g e n c i e s o c c urring during postnatal period. Figure 2.32: Showing Hours of Stay in Hospital after the delive ry in Percentage Source: HMIS Report Length of stay after childbirth is also an important factor inf luencing MMR, but it has not increased to the same degree as institutional birth. There was a gigantic increase in institutional births from 39% in 2005-06 to 95.45% in 2021-2 022 and 95% in 2020- 2021. During the same period, the percentage of mothers dischar ged within 48 hrs. is only 32% in 2021-2022 and 33.6% in 2020-21. As per maternal and child health program guidelines in India, i t is clearly mentioned that all the government health facil ities should dischar ge the mother and ba by only after 48 hours of delivery in case of normal delivery and after 7 days in case of delivery conduct ed by cesarean sections. 52 Figure 2.33: Showing top five states where woman stay in hospit al less than 48 hours after the delivery FY: 2021-2022. Although it is not desirable and all efforts should be made to convince the mothers to stay in the institution for the first 48 hrs. The above graph i s showing top five States where mothers return home before 48 hrs. of delivery reported i n HMIS. However this percentage is very low in Calcium Supplementation in Post-Partum woman: Dietary requirement for different nutrients increases during pregnancy and lactation. The dietary intake of many Indian women, however, is significan tly below recommended dietary requirements. Of these, two most important nutrients are iron and calcium. Iron Supplementation : Post-partum period may serve as a time to restore iron lost dur ing pregnancy and delivery, however this period may serve as a time to restore ir on lost during pregnancy and delivery. One of the strongest predictors of postpartum ana emia is anaemia during pregnancy, as iron stores tend to remain low for several months after childbirth, especially if t here is significant blood loss during the delivery and additional iron is not consumed in sufficient quantities. Iron deficiency and anaemia during the postpartum period may ha ve long-term health implications for the mother and her infant. Mothers with low ir on stores at the time of delivery and following childbirth may experience fatigue, alter ed cognition and depressive symptoms. These alterations in the mother's emotiona l and cognitive functioning may, in turn, affect her interactions with the infa nt and may negatively impact infant behaviour and development (WHO Guideline: Iron su pplementation in postpartum women). Iron supplementation has proven to be effective for increasing haemoglobin concentrations among pregnant and non-pregnant women (WHO), and i r o n supplementation has been recomme nded as a public health approac h to improve 53maternal and infant health outco mes in different age groups (An emia Mukt Bharat Training Tool Kit).

The National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) - 2012 54data from 10 Indian states shows that the daily calcium intake during pregnancy and lactation for Indian women is less than 30% of RDA (which means it is only 400 mg/d). This shows that most pregnant and lactating women in India have low dietary calcium intake.

Review of HMIS data in India shows that, despite major initia tives taken by the Government i n the last 10 years, , in some states still shows high home deliveries take place at home, and the coverage of antenatal care services is low. In some states MMR still remains high. Moreover, within the country, there is a wide interstate and intrastate v ariation in all maternal health indicators. The challenge is how to make safe motherhood strategies in the future more successful. Strengthening Health services and FRU s hould be the focus of the safe motherhood strategy, al ong with ensuring skilled care at all births. Policy and programmes designed to implement evidence-based strategies and detailed micro- level programme planning is needed. Monitoring effective implem entation and measuring progress is essential for success. 56Annexure-2.1 Maternal Mortality Ratio India & Major States MMR Maternal Mortality Rate INDIA 97 6 Assam 195 12.1 Bihar 118 11.2 Jharkhand 56 4.2 Madhya Pradesh 173 15.3 Chhattisgarh 137 9.9 Odisha 119 7.3 Rajasthan 113 9.6 Uttar Pradesh 167 14.3 Uttarakhand 11 Andhra 45 2.4 Karnataka 69 3.5 Kerala 19 0.9 Tamil Nadu 54 2.7 SOUTH SUBTOTAL 49 2 Gujarat 57 3.9 Haryana 110 8 Maharashtra 33 1.8 Punjab 105 5.4 West Bengal 103 5 Other states 77 3.9 OTHER SUBTOTAL 76 4 Source: SPECIAL BULLETIN ON MATERNAL MORTALITY IN INDIA 2018-20 , SRS. 57 Annexure- 2.2 State/UT wise distribution of Pe rcentage of Pregnant - wise distribution of Percentage of ANC Registered to Estimated Pregnancies State/UT 2020-2021 2021-2022 wise distribution of Percentage of four or more ANC in India to total ANC Registration State/UT 2020-21 21021-22 All India 78.3 Percentage of Pregnant women rece ived TT2+ TT Booster to Total distribution of Percentage of Deworming during Pregnancy to total ANC rcentage of Institutional deliv eries, Percentage of safe deliveries an d Percentage of home deliveries to total reported deliveries State/UT % Institutional deliveries to Total Reported Deliveries % Safe (Institutional +SBA Home) deliveries to Total Reported Deliveries % Home deliveries to Total Reported Deliveries 2020-2021 0.17 0 The 65 Annexure-2.10 State/UT wise of Pe rcentage of SBA attended home d eliveries to Total Reported Home Deliveries State/UT 2020-2021 2021-2022 Pe rcentage of State/UT % C-section deliveries (Public + Pvt.) to reported institutional (Public + Pvt.) deliveries % C-sections conducted at public facilities to Deliveries conducted at public facilities % C-sections conducted at Private facilities to Deliveries conducted at private facilities 2020-2021 2021-2022 2020-2021 26.01 78.69 83.88 6768 CHAPTER 3 CHILD HEALTH In India, an estimated 26 millions of children are born every year. Children 0-6 years age group accounts 13% (as per Census 2011) of the total population of country and nearly one fifth of the world's annual childbirths (as per UNICEF). Around 3.5 million babies in India are born too early and more than one million new-borns are discharg ed each year from Special New-born Care Units (SNCUs). The newborn delivered early and th ose who are admitted in SNCU are at high risk and need focused care. The Child Health programme under the National Health Mission (N HM) comprehensively integrates interventions that improve child survival and addres ses factors contributing to infant and under-five mortality. Critical services are made available through community outreach and through health facilities at various levels (primary, firs t referral units, tertiary heal th care facilities). The newborn and child health are now the two key pillars of the Reproductive, m aternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCH+A) strategic approach, 2013. Around 40% percent of neonatal deaths happen during delivery or first 24 hours of birth, which are preventable if skilled health care is provided and delivery conducted at institution. In addition, early initiation and exclusive breast-feeding aids in survival rates of a new born. Child survival is interlinked with the health of the mother Child health goals under SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) Go al 3.2: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborn an d children under 5 years of age , with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 liv e births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1000 live births.

Infant Mortality Rate: Infant mortality represents an important component of under-fiv e mortality. Like under-five mortality, infant mortality rates measure child survival. They reflect the social, economic and environmental conditions in which children (and others in socie ty) live, including their health care. Mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable pop ulations. In addition, infant mortality rate is an MDG indicator. The infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths for ev ery 1,000 live births. It gives us key information abou t maternal and infant health he nce infant mortality rate is an important marker of the overall health of a society. As per the Sample Registration System 2020 , the IMR at all India level is 28 per 1000 live births in 2020. The trend of Infant mortality at all India leve l is provided in Figure 3.1, which shows around 33% decline in Infant Mortality Rate is observed in India during 2 012 to 2020. Figure 3.1: Trend of Infant Mortality Rate from 2012 to 2020 at All India Level Source: Sample Registration System b. Neo-natal Mort ality Rate: Mortality during the neonatal period accounts for a large propo rtion of child deaths, and is considered a useful indicator of maternal and newborn neonatal health and care. The probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the fi rst 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first seven days of life, and 42 39 34 32 28 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020IMR 70late neonatal deaths, occurring after the seventh day but befor e the 28th completed day of life Neo-natal Mortality Rate (NMR) is defined as a number of deaths of children during the period of 0-28 days per 1000 live births . NMR stands 20 per 1000 live births in India in 2020 as per Sample Registration System 2020. Around 31% decline in Neo-natal Mortality Rate has been observed in India during 2012 to 2020. The trend of Neo-natal Mortalit y Rate at all India level is provided in Figure 3.2 Figure 3.2: Trend of Neo-natal Mortality Rate 2012 to 2020 at A ll India Level Source: Sample Registration System c. Under-five Mortality Rate Similar to the infant mortality rate, the mortality rate of chi ldren aged under 5 years is a baseline indicator of how a country is progressing towards assu ring children's rights - in particular, their rights to life, health care services, nutriti on, water, social security and protection. Under-5 mortality rate is a leading indicator of the level of c hild health and overall development of country. Under-five mortality is defined number of deaths of children in the age 0-5 years per 1000 live births. As per the Sample Registration System 2020 , the under five- mortality rate is 32 per 1000 live births in 2020. Around 39% d ecline in Under-five mortality Rate observed in India during 2012 to 2020.The trend of Under-f ive Mortality Rate at all India level is provided in Figure 3.3. 29 26 24 23 20 05101520253035 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) 71 Figure 3.3: Trend of Under-five Mortality Rate 2012 to 2020 at All India Level Source: Sample Registration System Under National Health Mission (NHM) , the programme of home based and facility based care for the newborn was launched to complete the continuum of care from facility to community. Health Management Information System (HMIS) collects data on around 100 d a t a elements related to Child health only. They are covered under various programs sub components like Pregnancy Outcomes, Home Based New Born Care (HBNC), Sick Newbo rn Weekly Iron fol ic acid (WIFS) Junior, Childhood Diseases and Death . 3.2 Home Based New Born care (HBNC): For reduction of neonatal mortality, Home Based New Born Care implemented since 2011. Home Based Newborn Care s cheme for the reduction of neonatal mortality, has incen tivized Accredited Social Healt h Activist (ASHA) for making visits to all newborns and their mothers according to specified schedule up to 42 days of life. ASHA records the weight, ensurin g immunization, safety of mothe r & newborn and registration. The information is recorded in MCP cards & ASHA v isit form. Also, provision for extra care to all newborn discharged after treatment of sickness from Special Newborn Care Units (SCNU) and th ose who are born as preterm or low birth weight babies is being ensured through structured home visits follow up by ASHA till 1 year of life. In case of SNCU discharged newborns, the day of discharge is day one. The HBNC schedule (as per revised guidelines 2014) is as follow: 52 45 3936 32 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020UNDER 5 MORTALITY RATE (U5MR) 72 6 HBNC- Six visits in case of Institutional Deliveries (Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 & 42) 7 HBNC- Seven visits in case of Institutional Deliveries (Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 & 42) \"During the HBNC visits\", services offered like essential care of new born, examination of the new born, early recognition of danger signs, stabilization and referral, Counselling of the mother for breast feeding, warmth, care of the baby, Immunizati on, post-partum care and use of family planning methods.

Therefore, home based care and management of illnesses is done through HBNC to all the home deliveries, which will also help in reducing neo-natal mor tality. Various States/UTs have shown an increase (FY 2021-22) in seven HBNC for home deliverie s from previous year (FY 2020-21) presented in Figure 3.5. In addition, 6% increase is s hown at All India level. 47.6%(FY 2020-21) 58.2%(FY 2021-22) 73 Figure 3.5.

Therefore, HBNC is again required for the remaining critical period. There are States/UT s presented in the Figure 3.6 where an increase in HBNC covera ge in case of Institutional del iveries is observed. At All India level 6% increase is seen in 2021 -22 as per the reported data o n HMIS when compared to previous year (FY 2020-21). Figure 3.6. Percentage of 6 HBNC coverage to total Institutional deliveries in States/UTs showing an increase during 2021-22 from 2021-21 States/UTs wise total number of H ome & Institutional Deliveries followed by 7 & 6 HBNC Visits respectively as reported in HMIS 2021-22 is provided at Annexure-3.1 3.3 Facility Based New Born Care (FBNC) Facility Based Newborn Care (FBNC) programme is one of the key initiatives launched by the Government of India under the National Rural Health Mission and RMNCH+A Strategic programme to improve the status of newborn health in the countr y. However, HBNC increased the admission of sick new born but care of newborn was also req uired. Therefore, Ministry 74 of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India (MoHFW, GoI) established Facility Based New-born Care services in health care facilities at different levels so that facility based intervention aids to drop Neonatal Mortalit y rate (NMR). The various components of FBNC are following: a. Newborn Care Corners (NBCCs) are established at all delivery points to provide essential newborn care. It is a dedicated space within the deli very room and located in every Labor Rooms (LR) and maternity Operation Theatres (OTs) a nd aims to provide immediate care to all newborns who require basic resuscitation and thermal care b. Newborn Stabilization Units (NBSUs) are being established at all Community Health Centers/First Referral Units for management of selected newborn conditions and to stabilize serious and sick newborns before referral to highe r centers. c. Special Newborn Care Units (SNCUs) are established at district hospitals and sub district hospitals with annual delivery load more than 3000 to provide care for sick newborns, that is, all type of n eonatal care except assisted ve ntilation and major surgeries. 3.3.1 Newborn Stabilizatio n Units (NBSUs): The second level of care after NBCC is known as Newborn Stabilization Units (N BSU), which is located at the block level facilities to manage newborns who are sick but stable. NBSUs are responsible to stabilize a sick baby before referring to a higher care center and being located at block level brings care nearer to homes/villag es of sick babies. NBSUs deliver first level of care under the FBNC framework, would manage low birth weight infants 1800 grams - provide phototherapy, thermal care using radiant warmer and feeding assistance as needed. As per HMIS data of 2020-21 & 2021-22, at all India level the - percentage of NBSU admission out of total live births reported is 3 percent . States/UTs wise percentage distribution of NBSU admissions to total live births i s represented in Table 3.2. 75 Live Births in States/UTs during 2021-22 States Reporting =<3% NBSU admissions i.e. reported NBSU admissions against the reported pre-term babies in States/UTs reported in HMIS in 2021-22 shows that few of the States/UTs re ported less than 45 percentage of admissions when compared to pre-term live births. The repre sentation is given in the figure.3.7 . Figure 3.7 State/UT- wise percentage NBSU Admission out of total pre-term new-borns 2021-22 States/UTs wise total live births, number of newborns & NBSU admissions as reported in HMIS 2021-22 is provided NBSU to total 76 3.3.2 Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU): The third level of care, the Special Newborn Care Units (SNCUs) located in district hospitals, Sub district Hospitals and tertiary care hospitals, targets the Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) newborns below 1800 grams and/or those suffering from other ser ious conditions. SNCUs are set up to improve the new born health within first week of thei r survival which is considered to be the most crucial period of newborns life. Approximately 15% of newborns require facility based care, thus under the FBNC program, Special Newborn Care U nits (SNCUs). Major admission criterion except weight, are Perinatal asphyxia, Apnea or gasping, Refusal to feed, Respiratory distress, jaundice, Hypothermia, Central cyanosis, Shock, Coma, convulsion or encephalopathy etc. SNCU is dedicated unit in labor room proposed to offer special care for sick newborns, which provides all essential neo-natal care except for assisted ventilation and major surgeries. Maximum of the deaths have bee n reported essentially in the first week of life thus for plummeting on IMR and under-5 morta lity rates, it is imperative to cut down NMR indispensably during first week of life. a. Admissions & Mortality in SNCUs During the year 2021-22 , there were a total of 12,55,875 admissions reported from the SNCUs out of which 89,770 babies died giving an annual mortality rate in SNCU of 7.14%. States/UTs wise distribution of the Inborn & Out born admission rate in the SNCUs (out of the total SNCU admissions) is repres ented in Figure 3.8 where varia tions in different States/UTs can be seen in the data report ed on HMIS for the FY 2021-22. Figure 3.8 State/UT wise percentage of Inborn & Admission % Outborn SNCU Admission 77 One of the key components of the National Health Mission is to provide every village in the country with a trained female community health worker- an ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) . An ASHA is a key pillar of NHM who works at the community lev el to provide the outreach health care service s and motivate the beneficiarie s to avail the health care services in the nearby facilities. Figure 3.9 shows the States/ UTs wise percentage of newborns admission in SNCU referred by ASHA reported in HMIS during 2021 -22. However, various reported nil data.

Despite low SNCU mortality, neonatal deaths (age-wise) reported out of total infant deaths reported are more than 50% (in infant deaths) to live births reported shows that it is imperative to cut down NMR indispensably during first week of l ife. As per data, 5% of total infants are admitted in SNCU to total live births reported duri ng 2021-22. Table 3.3 shows States/UTs-wise deaths in the SNCU to the total admissio ns happened during 2021-22.

The practice of early initiation can decreas e the newborn mortality and morbidity, which should be an integral part of safe delivery pr ocedure. Children who are exclusively breastfed are less likely to die from life threatening diseases. In FY 2020-21 and FY 21-22 percentage of new born breast fed wi thin 1 hr of delivery is more than 90% at All India Level including most of the States/UTs. H owever, few of the States/UTs have still shown percentages less than 85%, which is presented in figure 3.11. Figure 3.11 States/UTs wise new borns breast fed within 1 hour of birth during 21- 22 (reported less than 85% ) In addition to this, there are five States/UTs, which have show n decline in percentage of breast-feeding in FY 2021-22 in comparison to the 2020-21. In F Y 2020-21, these States/UTs reported more than 90% of initia tion of breastfeeding within 1 hr of delivery. However, in FY 2021-22 the States/UTs as shown in the figure, percentage declined below 90% presented in 85% new borns breast fed within 1 hour of birth during 21-22 81 Figure 3.12 States/UTs showing decline in breastfed within 1 hour during 2020-21 & 2021-22 3.4.2 Low Birth Weig ht Infant (<2.5 Kg) The weight of the newborn depends on the health of the mother d uring the pregnancy period. A birth is considered as of low birth weight when the weight of the infant at birth is less than 2500 g (WHO). Born with a low weight may elevate subsequent adverse health c onsequence for the infant. The immediate consequence of low birth weight i s infant mortality, particularly in the first month of life. Some low-birthweight babies are hea lthy, but others have serious health problems that need treatment. Premature birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) and fetal growth restriction are the most common causes of low birt hweight. Women who went for more than four ANC visit has lesser chance o f having low birth weight babies. The ANC visit for the women implies that they are being provided with necessary care during pregnancy, thus reducing chances of adverse pregnancy ou tcomes. In India, 12.49 percent infants were found to be of low weight against those infants weighed at birth. However, State/UT wise representation on the geograph ical map is represented in figure 3.13 in the four ranges as provided below: 1. < 5% Low birth weight infants 2. >=5 to <10% Low birth weight infants 3. >=10 to <15% Low birth weight infants 4. >=15% And Diu % new borns breast fed wit hin 1 hour of birth 20-21 % new borns breast fed wit hin 1 hour of birth 21-22 82 Figure 3 .13 States/UTs wise Low Birth Weight Infants (<2.5 kg) during FY 2021- 22 States/UTs wise total live births, Total New born weighed at birth, Newborns having weight less than 2.5 kg and newborns breast fed within 1 hour of birth as reported in HMIS 2021- 22 is provided at Annexure 3 .4. 83 3.4.3 Pre-term (High Risk) babies Preterm birth (premature birth) is a significant public health problem across the world because of associated neonatal (first 28 days of life) mortalit y and short- and long-term morbidity and disability in later life. World Health Organization (WHO) defines preterm as babies born alive before 37 completed weeks of gestation or few er than 259 days of gestation since the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP). In India, out of 27 million babies born every year (2010 data), 3.5 million babies born were premature. Newborn deaths (those in the first month of life) ac count for 40 percent of all deaths among children under five years of age. Preterm birth is the world's number one cause of newborn deaths. More than three-quarters of pret erm babies can be saved with in expensive care such as essential care during child birth, antenatal steroid injections and postnatal care like kangaroo mother and basic care for infections and breathing difficulties . Identification of risk factors in women with improved care befo re, between and during pregnancies; better access to contraceptives and increased empo werment/ education can further decrease the preterm birt h rate (the number of preterm births divided by the number of live births). Preterm newborns are classified b ased on completed gestation pe riod as: \u00be Extremely Preterm - Less than 28 \u00be Very Preterm - 28 to <32 weeks \u00be Late and Moderate Preterm - 32 to <37 weeks Extremely preterm babies require neonatal intensive care for su rvival. Most of the other preterm babies have a good chance of healthy survival with special newborn care envisaged at sub district, district and medical college hospitals, couple d with facility based kangaroo mother care and home based newborn care. Figure 3.14 shows 12 States/UTs, which have reported preterm to total live births more than equal to 5%. However, all remaining States/UT's reported less t han 5% of preterm delivered during 84 Figure 3.14 States/UTs livebirths FY 2021-22 3.4.4 Still Birth Rate A baby, who dies after 28 weeks of pregnancy, but before or dur ing birth, is classified as a stillbirth. The Still Birth Rate (SBR) is defined as the number of still bi rths per 1000 total births (live birth + still birth) . As per WHO, there are nearly 2 million stillbirths every year, one each 16 seconds. Over 40 per cent of all stillbirths occur duri ng labour - a loss that could be avoided with improved quality during childbirth including routi ne monitoring and timely access to emergency obstetric care. Experiencing a stillbirth during pregnancy or childbirth is a tragedy, there are psychological costs to women, especially women, and their families, such as m aternal depression, financial consequences and economic percuss ions, as well as stigma and ta boo. The stillbirth rate is a key indicator of quality of care durin g pregnancy and childbirth India's Newborn Action Plan has MOHFW vision \"E achieve \"Single Digit SBR\" by 2030, with all the states to i ndividually achieve this target by 2030 with 4.4% average annual r eduction rate (ARR) of Still Bir th Rate. Data reported in HMIS by States/UTs shows that the stillbirth-declining rate per 1000 births i.e. 11.79 during 2021-22, which was 15.5 in 2013-14 in India. Figure 3.15 presents the trend in the Still Birth rate declined around 24 percent at All India level. 13.7 12.3 10.49.9 9.78.9 6.1 5.9 5.85.4 5.2 5.0 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.0 The Haveli And And based on HMIS data reported during 2013-14 to 2021-22 In 2021-22, at all India level, still birth rate (Still births/Livebirths + Still Births) is 11.79 percent , however it is observed that there are 15 States/UTs which have reported lower than the national average. The details of the States/UTs -wise perce ntage of Still Births as reported in 2021-22 is provided in Figure 3.16.

When the natural sex ra tio at birth prevails, about 48.8% of all children born were girls. Sex ratio at Birth is defined as the number of females per 1000 males in the population and is an important social indicator to measure the extent of prevaili ng equity between males and females in a society at a given point of time. Child Sex Ratio is a very vital indicator to check the abnormalities, which are leading to imbalanced sex ratio. I f the sex ratio is improved only at birth, then it would surely lead to increase in overall sex ratio in each age group up to 6 years of age. As per data reported on HMIS by States/UTs, wise Sex Ratio at birth is shown in figure 3.18. 87 Figure 3.18 Sex ratio at Birth during 2021-22 Sex ratio is more accurate and r efined indicator of the extent of prenatal sex selection. Ministry of health & Family Welfare had passed an act 1994 as Pre-Concep tion and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, which emphasized to stop female feticides and arrest the 889892898920924924927928929933934934935938938939939940940941941943944945946946947947950950953957960963968981994 820 840 860 880 900 920 940 960 980 1000 1020The Dadra And Nagar 88 declining sex ratio in India. The act banned prenatal sex determination to promote the gender equality. Sex ratio at Birth at all India level has increased by around 2 percent only from 918 (2013-14) to 934 (2021-22). Figure 3.19 presents the trend of Sex ratio a t Birth at National level reported in HMIS during 2013-14 to 2021-22. Figure 3.19 Trend- Sex ratio at Birth at All India Level Figure 3.20 depicts those 11 States/UTs, contributing in declin e trend of SRB during 2021-22 when compared to 2020-21. Figure 3.20 States/UTs declining Live Births - Male, Live Birth s-Female and Sex Ratio at Birth as reported in HMIS duri ng 2021-22 is provided at Annexure 3.6 3.6 Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre (NRC) Nutritional Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs) are being set up in t he health facilities for inpatient management of severely malnourished children, with counselling of mothers for proper feeding. The NRCs are facility based care units where severely acute malnourished (SAM) children below five years are admitted with their mothers/ care givers for treatment, stabilization and rehabilitation. The Mothers/ Care Giver stays with the children at the NRCs and attend counseling sessions on how to take care of the SAM c hild after discharge from the NRC. Special foods, nutritional supplements, medicines are admi nistered according to the guidelines of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. 19.8 milli on children below age 6 in India are undernourished (ICDS 2015). Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) is an important contributing fa ctor for most deaths amongst children suffering from common childhood illness, such as diarr hoea and pneumonia. SAM is an important preventable and treatable cause of morbidity and m ortality in children below five years of age in India. A number of state governments have taken the lead and are in the process of scaling up the establishment of Nutritional Rehabili tation Centres (NRCs) with the intention to improve the quality of care being provided to chil dren with SAM and to reduce child mortality. The Major objectives of the NRC are: 1. To provide facility based mana gement to children with SAM 2. To reduce under 5 mortality due to Severe Acute Malnutrition There are two elements, which are captured under HMIS related t o NRC. These include Number of children admitted in NRC and Number of children disch arged with target weight gain from the NRCs. As mentioned in Figure 3.21, at national level percent of Child ren discharged with target weight gain (against the children admitted) from the NRCs during 2021- 22 is 59% which is showing a decline from 2020-21 which was reported as 61%. There are 17 States/UTs, which are showing children discharged with target weight gain higher than the national average reported on HMIS. 90 Figure 3.21: Percentage of Child ren discharged with target weig ht gain from the NRCs, States/UTs - HMIS during 2020-21 & 2021-22 State/UT-wise number of reported children admitted in NRC and d ischarged with target weight gain from the NRCs as reported in HMIS during 2021-22 is provid ed Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) is a program to improve the overall quality of life of children enabling all children achieve their full potential; and also provide comprehensive care to all the children in the community. This program involve s screening of children from birth to 18 years of age for 4 Ds- Defects at birth, Diseases, Deficiencies and Development delays, spanning 32 common health conditions for early detectio n and free treatment and management, including surgeries at tertiary level. Children dia gnosed with identified selected health conditions are provided early intervention services and follow-up care at the district level. These services are provide d free of cost, thus helping t heir families reduce out of pocket expenditure incurred on the treatment. According to March of Dimes (2006), out of every 100 babies bor n in this country annually, 6 to 7 have a birth defect. This would translate to around 17 lak hs birth defects annually in the country and accounts for 9.6% of all the newborn deaths. Variou s nutritional deficiencies affecting the preschool children range from 4 per cent to 70 per cent. Developmental delays are common in early childhood affecting at least 10 percent of the children. These delays if not intervened timely may lead to permanent disabilities includ ing cognitive, hearing or vision impairment. Also, there are group of diseases common in childre n viz. dental caries, rheumatic heart disease, reactive airways diseases etc. Early detection a nd management diseases including deficiencies bring added value in preventing these co nditions to progress to its more severe and debilitating form and thereby reducing hospitalizati on and improving implementation of Right to Education. Realizing the importance of Birth Defects and its implications on the affected individual, family and society, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India under Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) initiated Newborn screening for Birth Defects at all delivery points with special focus on visible Birth Defects. Those Newborns ide ntified with Birth Defects will be referred to higher centres for further evaluation and management. Under RBSK initiative 0-6 year's age group will be specifically managed at District Early Intervention Center (DEIC) level while for 6-18 years age group , management of conditions will be done through existing pu blic health facilities. DEIC wi ll act as referral linkages for both the age groups. 92 First level of screening is done at all delivery points through existing Medical Officers, Staff Nurses and ANMs. After 48 hours until 6 weeks the screening of newborns will be done by ASHA at home as a part of Home Based New-born Care (HBNC) package. Outreach screening is done by dedicated Mobile Health teams for 6 weeks to 6 years at anganwadis centres and 6-18 years children at school. Once the child is screened and r eferred from any of these points of identification, it would be ensured that the necessary treatment/intervention is delivered at zero cost to the family. Health screening of children was a kno wn intervention under the School Health Programme. In Health Management Information System (HMIS), around 12 data elements related to Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) are being captured rega rding screening for birth defect, screening by RBSK mobile team at Aanganwadi centers and schools, identification and management of Diseases, deficien cies and development delays. i. Screening for Defect at Birth- Child Health Screening and Early Intervention Services under NH M envisage covering 30 identified health conditions for early detection and free treatment & management. Based on the high prevalence of diseases like hypothyroidism, s ickle cell, anaemia and beta thalassemia in certain geographical pockets of some States /UTs , and availability of testing and specialized support facilities, States/UTs may incorporate them as part of this initiative. At all India level, there were 2 ,03,38,078 live birth, of which 81,43,177 (40%) newborn were screened for defects at birth (as per RBSK) during 2021-22 in comparison to previous year 2020-21 which was 36%. 4 percent increase was observed dur ing two financial years to total live births reported in the respective years. Figure 3.12 shows the Number of Newborns Screened for Defects at Birth. Figure 3.22- Number of Newborns Screened for Defect at Birth du ring 2020- 21and 2021-22 (in Lakhs) 93 Figure 3.23 presents the percentage of newborns screened for de fect at birth against total live birth as reported in HMIS during 2021-22.

Morbidity (common illnesses): Congenital anomalies, injuries, and non-communicable diseases ( chronic respiratory diseases, acquired heart diseases, childho od cancers, diabetes, and obesity) are the emerging priorities in the global child health agenda. Trends in morbidity and mortality in the children are important indicators of the status of health in a country. They also help in determining goals and allocatin g resources to areas of which needs more importance. Childhood morbidities are a major cause of mortality of children and the burden of child mortality from preventable and treatable di seases, which are treatable with simple interventions, is an important area of concern. Malaria, respiratory tract infection and diarrheal diseases are the leading causes of childhood morbidity and mortality. In HMIS data is being captured for 12 Childhood diseases treated in OPD (Pneumonia, Asthma, Sepsis, Diphtheria, Pertusis, Tetanus Neona trum, Tuberculosis, 97 Acute Flaccid Paralysis(AFP), Measles, Malaria, Severe Acute Ma lnutrition) and 2 Childhood Diseases treated in IPD (ARI and Diarrhoea). In the OPDs among childhood diseases, the footfall for the diar rhea (76%) is the highest, which is also treated in IPDs. P neumonia (12%) occurrence is th e most, followed by Asthma (4%) and SAM (3%). Percentage occurrence of rest of all disease s is less than 5% to total OPD for childhood reported on HMIS. Figure 3.26 represents the bifurcation of percentage of OPDs among childhood diseases (cause wise) as reported in HMIS during 2021-22. Figure 3.26 Cause - wise percentage distribution of OPDs among Childhood diseases during 2021-22 3.8.2 Infant & Child Mortality Infant mortality is the death of an infant before his or her fi rst birthday while Child mortality or the under-five mortality rate refers to the probability of a child dying between birth and exactly 5 years of age for every 1,000 live births. Infant mort ality rate is of high importance when it comes to the health of a society. As per UNICEF, globally infectious diseases, including pneumoni a, diarrhoea and malaria, remain a leading cause of under-five deaths, along with preterm birth and intrapartum-related complications. Despite this considerable progress, improving ch ild survival remains a matter Pneumonia 11.86% Asthma 3.92% Sepsis 2.34% Malnutrition (SAM) 3.00% 98 of urgent concern. In 2020 alone, roughly 13,800 under-five dea ths occurred every day, an intolerably high number of large ly preventable child deaths. HMIS captures data on Mortality age wise and cause wise of chil d up to 5 years of age. The data captured under the following heads: 1. Infants upto 24 hours of age 2. Infant Deaths up to 4 weeks 3. Infant Deaths 1-12 months 4. Child Deaths 1-5 years The figure 3.27 represents the States/UTs wise reported percent age total infant deaths to total live births reported above All India figure i.e., as reported o n HMIS during FY 2020-21 & 2021- 22. Figure. 3.27 States/UTs infant deaths reported during 2020-21 & 2021-22 Infant's deaths are bifurcated into three categories based on t he age of the infants for data collection under HMIS. Based on the HMIS data as uploaded by St ats/UTs during the FY 2021- 22 it is seen that based on the age group when the infant dies, maximum deaths (57%) are occurring during the neonatal period (within 28 days of post-pa rtum), followed by the infant deaths (25%) occurring in post neonatal period and then infant deaths (18%) within 24 hours. Figure 3.28 represents the age w ise bifurcation of the infant d eaths reported during 2021-22. 6.8 3.7 2.2 2.0 1.9 2.0 2.1 1.8 2.1 1.6 1.8 2.3 1.9 1.8 1.7 1.3 1.3 0.9 1.05.3 2.7 2.4 2.3 2.1 2.1 1.9 1.9 1.8 1.6 1.6 1.6 1.6 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.2 1.1 1.0% Infant Deaths 20-21 % Infant Deaths to live births 21-22 % Infant Deaths to live births 99 Figure 3.28 Total Infant Deaths by Age group wise during FY 202 1-22 Infant deaths up to 1 month (4 weeks) The first 28 days of life - the neonatal period - is the most v ulnerable time for a child's survival. Infants are at highest risk of dying in their first month of li fe at an average global rate as per UNICEF- 17 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2020, down by 54 per cent from 37 deaths per 1,000 in 1990. Children who die within the first 28 days of bir th suffer from conditions and diseases associated with lack of quality care at or immediately after birth and in the first days of life as the neonatal period is the most vulnerable time for a child. As per 2021-22 HMIS data, infant deaths occurring up to 4 weeks of age excluding the deaths within 24 hrs are being reported for two main causes i.e. sepsi s and asphyxia, rest all the deaths are reported under other causes. Out of two main causes which is captured by HMIS Asphyxia (22%) is the major reas on for the infant deaths in thi s age group, followed by Sepsis (17%).

Vaccines are substances that stimulate the body's own immune system to protect the person ag ainst subsequent infection or disease. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government o f India provides several vaccines to infants, children and pregnant women through the Un iversal Immunization Programme. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India introduced Immunization Programme in India in 1978 as 'Expanded Programme of Immunization' (EPI). It was further renamed as Universal Immunization Programme in 1 985 when its reach was expanded beyond urban areas included children upto 5 years and pregnant women. In 1992, it became part of Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Programme and in 1997, it was included in the ambit of National Reprodu ctive and Child Health Programm e. Since the launch of National Rural Health Mission in 2005, Univ ersal Immunization Programme has been an integral part of it. Universal Immunizati on Programme (UIP) of India is one of the largest public health programmes of the world imp lemented since 1985. It targets to cover around 2.67 crore newborns and 2.9 crore pregnant women annually. It is largely responsible for reduction of vaccine preventable under-5 mortal ity rate and maternal mortality (Source: NHM portal). The two major milestones of UIP have been achieved, one is elimination of polio in 2014 and 2nd is elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus in 2015. Under UIP, immunization is providing free of cost against 12 va ccine preventable diseases: Nationally against 11 diseases - Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus , Polio, Measles, Rubella, severe form of Childhood Tuberculosis, Rotavirus, diarrhea, Hepatitis B and Meningitis & Pneumonia caused by Hemophilus Influenza t ype B and Pneumococcal Pneumoni a. Sub-nationally against 1 disease - Japanese Encephalitis JE vac cine is provided only in endemic districts (Source: NHM portal). A child is said to be fully immunized if child receives all due vaccine (BCG, three doses of Oral Polio Vaccine, three doses of Pentavalent vaccine and one dose of Measles) as per national immunization schedule within 1st year age of child. 115 The details of National Immunization Schedule under UIP is give n in Table 4.1. Table 4.1: National Immunization Schedule Age Vaccination schedule after Td introduction At birth BCG, OPV-zero d ose, OPV-booster dose, Measles-2/ MR-2, JE-2* 5-6 years DPT second booster dose 10 & 16 years Td For pregnant woman Td-1 : early in pregnancy Td-2 : 4 weeks after Td-1 Td-B: if pregnancy occur within 3 years of last pregnancy and 2 Td doses were received Note * JE endemic States/Districts Government of India has expanded t h e b a sk et o f v a c c i n es t o i n c l ude six new vaccines - Tetanus and adult Diphtheria (Td ), Inactivated Poliovirus Vacci ne (PCV) at the national level and; Japanese encephalitis vaccine for adults at the subn ational level. Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV), introduced in November 2015 as part of Global Polio end- game strategy, to mitigate the risk associated with tOPV to bOP V switch. Rotavirus vaccine (RVV): RVV introduced in March 2016 to reduce mortality and morbidity caused by Rotavirus diarrhoea. Measles Rubella (MR) vaccine was introduced through campaign in 2017 targeting children in the age group of 9 months to 15 years (covering of the total population of the country) followed by 2 doses in routine immunization at 9-12 months and 16-24 months as part of goal of measles and rubella elimination by December 2023. Pneumococc al Conjugate Vaccine 116(PCV): PCV launched in May 2017 for reducing Infant mortality a nd morbidity caused by pneumococcal pneumonia. Tetanus & adult Diphtheria (Td) vaccine: Recommended by Nationa l Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) in 2016 due to epidemiological shift in age-group of diphtheria cases to school going children a nd adults. Thereafter, Td vacci ne has replaced 2 doses of TT or single booster dose of TT given to pregnant woman and booste r doses at 10 and 16 years of age. Adult Japanese Encephalitis (JE) Vaccine: Japanese National Vec tor Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) had identified 38 Districts from Assam, Utta r Pradesh and West Bengal with high burden of JE in adult age group for Adult JE vaccinat ion campaign. W i t h t h e a i m t o i n c r e a s e i m m u n i z a t i o n c o v e r a g e t o 9 0 % , t h e f l a g ship program Mission I n d r a d h a n u s h ( M I ) w a s l a u n c h e d i n D e c e m b e r 2 0 1 4 , f o l l o w e d b y t h e Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) in October 2017 for reaching the dropout and left-out children for immunization in pockets of low immunization coverage. With spec ial focus towards urban areas. As on May 2022, eleven phases of Mission Indradhanush ha ve been completed covering 701 districts across the country. In the National MIS portal of th e Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India called 'Health Management Information System (HMIS)', captures service delivery information reported primarily by public hea lth facilities across country o n monthly basis. There are around 50 data items related to Immunization services provided by various health facilities captured in Health Management Information System (HM IS). The various vaccines received by infants 0 to 11 mont h s i n c l u d e s B C G , D P T 1 , D P T 2 , D conjugate vaccine PCV1, PCV2; Various vaccines received by Children 9 - 11 months which include Measles & Rubella (MR) - 1st Dose, Measles 1st dose, JE 1st dose and PCV Booster. There are other vaccines related data items captured in HMIS wh ich includes vaccines given to Children of more than 12 months- Measles & Rubella (MR) - 2nd Dose, Measles 2nd dose, JE 2nd dose, DPT 1st booster, OPV booster ; Children of more than 23 months- DPT 2nd booster, Td 10 and 16 at 10 and 16 years of age respectively; Adverse Ev ent Following Immunization (AEFI), Number of Immunization sessions and Children received V itamin A Doses between 9 117months and 5 years, The analysis of some of the vaccines and im munizations coverage is provided in subsequent sections. 4. a. Immunization of Pregnant w omen/ mother against Tetanus an d Diphtheria: The use of Td is recommended during pregnancy to protect agains t maternal and neonatal tetanus & diphtheria during prenatal care. Vaccination during p regnancy also serves to boost immunity and increase the duration of protection to those pregnant women who had not received the full set of recommended booster doses. T e t a n u s T o x o i d ( T T ) v a c c i n e h a s b e e n r e p l a c e d w i t h T e t a n u s a n d adult diphtheria (Td) vaccine. Diseases like Tetanus and diphtheria can lead to hospitalizations or even cause death. The use of Td rather TT is recommended during pregnancy to protect against maternal and neonatal tetanus & diphtheria during prenatal care. A pregnant woman is said to be fully immunized for Td, if she g ets Td during her ANC visits (Td-1: early in pregnancy, Td-2: 4 weeks after Td-1 and Td-Boos ter: if pregnancy occur within 3 years). It is expected that programme should aim to achieve a t least 90 percent Pregnant W o m e n f u l l y i m m u n i z a t i o n f o r T d t a r g e t i n c o m i n g y e a r s . T h e d e t ails of Percentage of Pregnant Women fully immunized for T/Td at national level is given at Fig 4.1. Figure 4.1: Trend of Percentage of Pregnant Women fully immunized for TT/Td at National during 2017-18 to 2021-22 At All India level, percentage pregnant women registered for ANC fully immunized for Td during 2020-21 (86.3%) and 2021-22(86.5%) was almost same (Fig 4.2). There are twenty States, which have reported abov e the national average during 2021-22. The top five States are following Andhra The Details of Percentage of Pregnant Women fully immunized for Td during 2020-21 to 2021 -22 is provided in Fig 4.2. Figure 4.2: Percentage Pregnant Women fully immunized for Td during 2020-21 to 2021-22 and States having greater than national average duri ng 2021-22 (States/UTs with 2021-22 considered) States/UTs-wise number and percentage of Pregnant Women fully immunized for TT/Td during 2020-21 and 2021-22 is provided at Annexure-4.1. 4.2 Full Immunization of Children A Child aged between 9 and 11 months is said to be fully immuni zed if they receive one dose of BCG, three doses of Pentavale nt, three doses of Oral Polio Vaccines (OPV), and one dose of MR vaccine between 9-11 months of their birth. The full immunization coverage is measured as proportion of num ber of children provided all d u e v a c c i n es a s p e r i m m u ni z a t i o n sc h ed u l e w i t h i n 1st y ea r o f a g e against the estimated infants (0-1 year). In HMIS, data element \"Children aged between 9 and 11 months fully immunized- Male and Children aged between 9 and 11 months fully immunized- Female\" are captured. The sum of Children aged between 9 and 11 months fully immunized- Male and Children aged between 9 and 11 months fully immunized- Female\" is considered as total no. of children 9 to 11 months fully immunized. 86.3 86.5 0102030405060708090100 (2017-18 vs. 2021-22): While comparing the Childhood immunization in last 5 years from base year 2017-18 to 2021- 2 2 , i t i s o b s e r v e d t h a t f u l l i m m u n i z a t i o n o f c h i l d r e n h a s b e e n c o n s o l i d a t e d f u r t h e r a n d increased by around 3 percent in last five years. At the nation al level, Children aged between 9 and 11 months fully immunized was around 91%* in 2021-22 while same was around 88% in 2017-18. There were 17 States in 2017-18, which have reporte d 90%, and above with full immunization of Children. Same number of States have reported 9 0%, and above in 2021- 22. Some of the selected five States, which have reported 90% a nd above in 2021-22 are Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, Lakshadweep, and Andhra Pradesh.

Rubella is a mild disease but when infection occurs in early pregnancy, it has the potential to cause spontaneous abortions, fetal deaths, stillbi rths and serious congenital defects in the child causing lifelong disabilities. Measles Rubella vaccine is given for preventing both measles an d rubella disease in the child. The first dose of Measles-Rubella vaccine needs to be administe red, according to the National Immunization Schedule, after the completion of 9 months until 1 2 months of age while during 16-24 months the second dose shall be given. HMIS captures children given Measles 1st dose and children give n MR 1st dose (9-12 months), measles 2 nd dose and MR 2nd dose (16-24 months Measles & Rubella (MR) - 1s t Dose is provided between 9 to 11 months of age. As per HMIS reported da ta, there were 89.2% children in 2020-21 and 90.4 % children in 2021-22 were given M easles & Rubella (MR) - 1st Dose and Measles 1st dose at the national level. There are 17 States/UTs which have reported 90% or above Child immunization (9-11months) - Measles & Rubella (MR)- 1st Dose and Measles 1st dose in 2021-22 while, there were 19 States have reported 90% or above Child immunization in 2020-21. State/ UTs wise coverage of Measles/ MR vaccination greater than national average is given in Fig 4.5. Figure 4.5: Child immunization (9-11months) - Measles & Rubella (MR) - 1st Dose and Measles 1st dose during 2020-21 and 2021-22 and States having greater than national average during 2021-22 (States/UTs with more than national avg. in 2021-22 considered): States/UTs-wise number and percentage of Children 9 to 11 month s have received Measles & Rubella (MR) - 1st Dose and Measles 1st dose during 2020-21 a nd 2021-22 is provided at Annexure-4.3. 4.2. iv OPV-0 and Hepatitis-B Birth Dose: Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV-0) Birth dose is made from live-attenuated Polioviruses. The vaccine is given as two drops into the child's mouth. OPV-0 giv es protection against the two types of Polioviruses (types 1, and 3) that cause Poliomyelitis (Polio) \u2014 a disease of the brain and spinal 123At All India level, there were 87.1 percent of Oral Polio Vacci ne (OPV-0) Birth dose in 2021- 22 as compared to 86.3 percent of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV-0) Bi rth dose given in 2020-21. There are 20 States/UTs, which have reported more than 90 perce nt Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV- 0) Birth dose in 2021-22 while there were 19 States/UTs during 2020-21 which have reported more than 90 percent OPV-0 Birth d ose. The details of States/UT s-wise Percent of Child immunization - OPV 0 (Birth Dose) is provided at Fig.4.6. Figure 4.6: States/UT-wise Percent of Child immunization - OPV 0 (Birth Dos e) during 2020-21 and 2021-22 124 Hepatitis-B Birth Dose refers to the dose given to the children within 24 hours of th eir birth. A child vaccinated with Hep-B after more than 24 hours of birth is not considered to have received the birth dose. The birth dose of Hepatitis B vac cine is effective in preventing perinatal transmission of Hepati tis B only if given within the first 24 hours. In 2020-21, percent of children r eceived Hepatitis-B0 (Birth Do se) was 72.1 percent while in 2021-22, it was increased to 75.6 percent. There was eight Stat es/UTs which have reported more than 90 percent children received Hepatitis-B0 (Birth Dose ).

DPT (Dipht heria + Pertussis + Tetanus) and Hep B are already part of routine immunization in India; Hi b vaccine is a new addition. Together, the combination is called Pentavalent. Hib vaccine ca n prevent serious diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b like pneumonia, meningi tis, bacteremia, epiglottitis, septic arthritis etc. Giving pentavalent vaccine reduces the nu mber of pricks to a child, and provides protection from all five diseases. Globally, Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) bacteria kills mor e than 370,000 children under five every year. Nearly 20% of these children may die as well. Hib vaccine can prevent over a third of pneumonia cases and 90% of Hib meningitis cases. I n d i a i n t r o d u c e d p e n ta v a l en t v a c c i n e i n it i a l l y in t w o st a t es v i z.

Rotaviruses is primarily transmitted by the faecal-oral route, rotaviruses a f f e c t t h e v a s t m a j o r i t y o f c h i l d r e n w o r l d w i d e b e f o r e t h e a g e o f 3 y e a r s , a n d i n m o s t developing countries before the first birthday. It is well known that diarrhoeal diseases are one of the most c ommon causes for morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years of age. Among the diarr hoeal diseases, rotavirus infection is one of the most common causes for moderate to seve re diarrhoea in children. The protection from Rotavirus infection is vaccination. In India, t he Government of India has launched Rotavirus Vaccine (RVV) in 2016. In phased in manner i t was rolled out across the country. To see the dropout in administrat ion of rotavirus 1 to rotavirus 2 and rotavirus 1 to rotavirus 3, during 2020-21 and 2021-22, a comparative analysis with charts is made. Based on the Fig 4.9, it is observed that highest drop out in Rota 1 to Rota 2, was observed in (-6%), in Rota 1 to Rota 3 in same three northeastern 1 to Rota 2, highest dropout was observed States, Chandigarh Manipur Meghalaya ( -14.7%) in 2021-22. Decline from 1st dose to 2nd dose -Rotavirus and 1s t dose to 3rd Dose during 2020-21 and 2021-22 is provided in Fig. 4.9. 128Figure 4.9: States/UT-wise Comparative Decline from 1st dose to 2nd dose - Rotavirus and 1st dose to 3rd Dose during 2020-21 and 2021-22: States/UTs-wise number and percentage of Child Immunization - O PV 0 (Birth Dose), Hepatitis-B0 (Birth Dose) during 2020-21 and 2021-22 is provide d at Annexure-4.6. 129 4.3 AEFI Adverse Events Following Immuniz ation (AEFI) defined as any unt oward medical occurrence following immunization and which does not necessarily have a ca usal relationship with the usage of vaccines. These events may include one or more unfavor able or unintended sign, s y m p t o m s o r l a b o r a t o r y f i n d i n g s w h i c h r a i s e s c o n c e r n a m o n g i m m u nization program managers, policy makers, family o f beneficiary and the communit y. AEFIs can be common and minor (like fever, local pain and swell ing), severe (like pain and swelling which spreads beyond the nearest joint or high-grade f ever) and serious AEFIs (conditions requiring hospitalization or leading to death or di sability). In HMIS, at present, three data items are captured for AEFI, Number of cases of AEFI - Abscess, Number of cases of AEFI - Death and Number of cases of AEFI - Others. As per reported data in HMIS, there were 213 and 155 AEFI death s were reported across India respectively in 2020-21 and 2021-22. There are 13 States that have reported nil AEFI deaths in 2020-21, while there are 19 State/UTs in 2021-22, whi ch have reported 25(12%), Maharashtra 16(7%) and r States/UTs which have reported at least one AEFI death s w a s 5 1 ( 2 4 % ) w e r e h i g h e s t A E F I deaths reported States/UTs in 2020-21 and while Uttar Pradesh each, West Bengal 15(10%) and other States/UTs which have reported at least one AEFI deaths was 30(19%) were highest AEFI deaths reported States/UTs during 2021-22. The State/UT-wise distribution of AEFI deaths for those who hav e reported AEFI deaths in HMIS during 2020-21 number Others Reported in HMIS during 2020-21 and 2021-22 is provided at Annexure-4.7. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of programme data of Immunization reporte d through HMIS, it can be said that, although, during th e pandemic year 2020-21, there wa s slight dip; however, it has increased again during 2021-22. Over the last five-year period, Coverage of immunization in Children and Pregnant women has increased substantially from 20 17-18 to 2021-22.

An Expert Com mittee (1971) of the WHO defined family planning as \"a way of thinking and living that i s adopted voluntarily, upon the basis of knowledge, attitudes and responsible decisions by indi viduals and couples, in order to promote the health and welfare of the family group and thus contribute effectively to the social development of a country\". Another Expert Committee defined and described family planning as follows: \"Family planning refers to practices that help individuals or couples to attain certain objectives: (a) to avoid unwanted births; (b) to bring about wanted births; (c) to regulate the intervals between pregnancies; (d) to control the time at which births occur in relation to the ages of the parent (e) to determine the number of children in the family In 1952, India became the first nation in the world to introduc e a National Programme for Family Planning. The Family Planning Programme has transfor med in terms of policy and actual programme execution from its historic start in 1952. The National Population Policy (NPP), introduced in 2000, brought a holistic and target-free a pproach that helped in the reduction of fertility to not only achieve population stabiliza tion goals but also promote reproductive health, leading to reduction in maternal, infant, and child mortality and morbidity. There was a gradual transition from the clinical app roach to the reproductive child health approach. Family Planning is a major pillar of the RMNCAH+N strategy. The program has come a long way since its inception with introduction of many new schemes a nd initiatives like \"Mission Parivar Vikas\" in 13 States (Seven high focus states and Six No rth Eastern States).Inclusion of new contraceptive methods (Injectable MPAand Centchroman pil ls), operationalization of FPLMIS for logistic and supply chain management of contraceptiv es, focus on post pregnancy contraception and many more. As a result,TFR and CBR have falle n significantly and FP indicators have improved substantially. 141Figure 5.1: Total Fertility Rate (TFR) and Crude Birth rate, Ye ar on Year-India Source: Sample Registration Survey Figure 5.2: MCPR and Unmet Need Source: NFHS III, IV, V From the figure 5.2 it may be identified that MCPR (Modern Cont raceptive Prevalence Rate) is increasing and Unmet need is continuously decreasing. 5.2 Contraceptive Methods under N ational Family Planning Progra m Contraceptive methods are, by definition, preventive methods to h e l p w o m e n a v o i d unwanted pregnancies. They include all temporary and permanent measures to prevent pregnancy resulting from coitus. The Department of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for implementation of the National Family Welfare Programme by interalia, encouraging the utilization of contraceptives and distribution of the same to the States/UTs under Free Suppl y Scheme and through Public Private Partnership (PPP) under Social Marketing Scheme. Family planning allows people to have desired number of children and determine the spacing of pr egnancies which is achieved through use of contraceptive methods.

Antara Programme- Injectable MPA Services Injectable Contraceptive MPA (Antara Programme) was introduced in the National Family Planning program in 2016. More than 71.73 lakh doses of Injectable Contraceptive MPA (Antara Programme) have been reported till 2021-22 from the tim e of its inception into the Family Planning Programme. In the Year 2021-22, Injectable MPA 23.74 lakh doses were provi ded, which has improved by 22% when compared to 19.40 lakh doses provided in the Year 2 019 -20. Figure 5.4: Improvement in uptak e of continuous doses of Injectable MPA in HMIS (2019-2022) Maximum number of Injectable MPA in 2021-22 were reported by Uttar Pradesh (5.9 lakh) followed by West Bengal (4. 0 1 l a k h ) a n d R a j a s t h a n ( 3 . 1 5 l akh).

Pandemic years 2020-21 and 2021-22 were challenging years for a ll services including Family Planning. The key programmatic highlights for the year 2020-21 and 2021-2 2 are as follows : In spite of the huge challenges encountered on account of the p andemic, the programme was able to stand ground and barring a few expected setbacks sp ecially in the reduction of sterilizations performed (since t he OTs were closed in the init ial peak period) was able to either improve or maintain its performance over the last two ye ars in PPIUCD, Chhaya and Injectable contraceptives. 1. Growth in PPIUCDs performance was reported in 2020-21 and 2021- 22. Performance of PPIUCD insertion improved on average of ~11.7%. 2. Injectable MPAs performance showed only a marginal decline of a round 3% in 2020-21 but in the year 2021-22 the performance improved by ~26%. 3. Centchroman (Chhaya), the indigenously developed weekly contrac eptive pill was an exemplifier across most of the st ates and its national performa nce more than doubled over the last year. In the year 2019-20 its distribution improv ed by 65% compared to 2019 -20 and in 2021-22, it further improved by 35% when compar ed with 2020-21. 4. The acceptance of PAIUCD in the Year 2020-21 declined by nearly 10% but in 2021-22, it has started improving and expected to reach to the Pre pande mic level. 5. Expectedly, due to the restrictions imposed and OTs being instr ucted to close for routine surgeries, sterilization services declined by ~ 20% but in 2021 -22 it has started improving and reported a growth of ~11% compared to 2020-21. 6. The WPD fortnight 2020 too was observed, where there was increa se in use of spacing methods both in 2020-21 and 2021-22. 7. The MPV districts performed better than their counterparts and contributed to 66% of all Injectable MPA administrations. 8. The failure and death rates following sterilization have also declined. 153Annexure-5.1 States/UTs wise number of Injectable Contraceptive MPA (Antara 36 83 Odisha States/UTs wise number of total Sterilization as IS States/UTs 2020-21 2021-22 All 2021-22 All Haryana 1187 1339 Himachal Pradesh 328 1216 Karnataka 722 590 1 Nagaland 1 2 Odisha 719 993 Puducherry 2 3 Punjab 279 240 Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh 1932 Bengal 881 604 160Annexure-5.8 States/UTs wise number of total and Method Wise -% of Female Sterilization 2021-22 as reported 720495 49119 37.7 36.4 24.2 1.7 A & N Islands 598 161 138 249 50 26.9 23.1 41.6 8.4 Andhra Pradesh Pradesh 864 218 376 262 8 30.3 Assam 23619 59439 10051 2477 262 1362 25 Jammu and Kashmir 9747 2588 1858 5024 11.8 5.6 81.3 0 25 45 0 0 35.7 64.3 0 Lakshadweep 52 1 3 48 359 3 0 0.5 98.6 0.8 Meghalaya 2227 23 635 1526 43 1 28.5 68.5 1.9 Mizoram 877 20 390 459 8 2.3 44.5 52.3 0.9 Nagaland 900 435 191 264 10 48.3 21.2 29.3 1.1 Odisha 82806 31404 30366 20666 36.7 25 0.8 The DNH and DD 918 162 300 281 175 17.6 32.7 30.6 19.1 Tripura 2852 817 189 1949 3.6 of Postpartum Sterilizations Deliveries as reported in HMIS States/UTs Number of total Institutional Deliveries Number of total Postpartum Sterilizations % of A & N 163Annexure-5.11 States/UTs wise (PAS) HMIS States/UTs 2020-21 2021-22 All India 42572 49119 Andhra 66 Gujarat 2637 2977 Haryana 164 172 Himachal Pradesh 22 25 Jammu 113 277 Jharkhand 890 890 Karnataka 4324 3919 Kerala 23 8 Nagaland 33 10 Odisha 404 370 Puducherry 147 370 Punjab 64 Pradesh wise number of Centchroman ed ributed ADOLESCENT HEALTH What is Adolescence? Adolescence is the phase of life between childhood and adulthoo d, from ages 10 to 19. It is a unique stage of human development and an important time for laying the foundations of good health. Desp ite being thought of as a healthy stage of life, during this phase, adolescents establish patterns of behaviour - for instan ce, related to diet, physical activity, substance use, and sexual activity - that can protect their health and the health of others around them, or put their health at risk now and in the future. To grow and develop in good health, adolescents need informatio n, including age- appropriate life skills education; health services that are acceptable, equitable, appropriate and effective; and safe and supportive environments. They also need opportunities to meaningfully participate in the design and delivery of interven tions to improve and maintain their health. Expanding such opp ortunities is key to responding to adolescents' specific needs and rights. Current Status The total estimated population of the world in 2010 was 6.91 bi llion. The number of persons in the age group 10-19 years (defined as Adolescents) was 1.19 billion and that in the age group 15-24 years (defined as Youth) was 1.22 billion. Together, the adolescent and youth population (10-24 years) constituted about 1.82 billi on (or 26.3%) of the total population in the world. The population of the young varies from country to country depe nding upon rate of fertility and mortality levels of the population. Figure 6.1: Adolescent Populatio n in Developing and Developed c ountries Developed countries Due to decline in both fertility and mortality rates in the past, Higher proportion of population in the old age groups (60 +) Developing countries Due to still prevailing high fertility and its slow decline over the past several years Higher proportion of young population. 169In India, as per Census 2011, adolescent population (10-19) is 253.2 million and that of the youth (15-24) is 231.9 million, constituting 20.9 per ce nt and 19.2 per cent of the total population respectively. The population of the young (10- 24) is 364.6 million (30.1%). There has been a decline in the proportion of adolescent popula tion and an increase of youth population compared to Census 2001. Why focus on adolescents? India has the largest adolescent population in the world, 253 m illion, and every fifth person being between 10 to 19 years. India stands to benefit so cially, politically and economically if this large number of adolescents are safe, healthy, educated and equipped with information and life skills to support the country's conti nued development. Both adolescent girls and boys lack access to information on is sues affecting their lives and have limited spaces to develop competencies crucial f or active participation. Adolescent girls, especially, are exposed to multiple layers of vulnerability due to pernicious social norms affecting the value of girls, which in turn affect s their ability to move freely and to make decisions affecting their work, education, marriage and social relationships. About 43 per cent of girls drop out before completing secondary education due to household responsibilities, marriage, child labour, limited relevance of education for employment and employability, distance to school and/or lack of sanitation facilities at the school. Menstruation disrupts the lives of girls in ways that a re unimaginable in many countries. At least 42 per cent o f girls in India use cloth rat her than disposable sanitary napkins (source unicef.org) . Initiatives of MoHFW for Adolescents To ensure holistic development of Adolescent Population, the Mi nistry of Health and Family Welfare launched Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RK SK) on 7th January 2014 to reach out to 253 million adolescents including adolescent: x male and female, x rural and urban, x married and unmarried, x in and out-of-school adolescents x with special focus on marginalized and underserved groups. The expanded scope of adolescent health programming in India no w include the below six thematic areas x Sexual and reproductive health, x Nutrition, x Injuries and violence (including gender based violence), x Non-communicable diseases, x Substance Misuse, x Mental health The strength of the program is its health promotion approach. I t is a paradigm shift from the existing clinic-based services to promotion, preventio n and reaching adolescents in their own environment, such as in schools, families and comm unities. 170 The interventions under RKSK can be broadly grouped into three categories: Figure 6.2: Interventions under RKSK Adolescent Friendly Health Clinics (AFHC) The approach, in the form of Adolescent Reproductive Sexual Hea lth (ARSH) Clinics to provide counselling on sexual & reproductive health issues only was initiated in 2006 under RCH II. Now with the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) its facility based approach the programme has AFHCs which entail a whole gamut of clinical and counselling services on diverse adolescent health issues ranging from Sexua l and Reproductive Health (SRH) to Nutrition, Substance abuse, Injuries and Violence (inc luding Gender based violence, Non Communicable Diseases and Mental Health. These ad olescent friendly health services are delivered through trained service providers- MO, A NM and Counsellors at AFHCs located at Primary Health Center s (PHCs), Community Health Cent e r s ( C H C s ) , D i s t r i c t Hospitals (DHs) and Medical Colle ges. Over the years there has been an increase in the number of boys and girls registered in AFHC with a drop appeari ng in the year 2020-21 owing to Covid-19. Community-based interventions Facility-based interventions School-based interventions 171 Figure 6.3 Number of boys an d girls registered in AFHC from 2017-18 to 2021-22 The key mandates facility-based cl inical and counselling services for adolescents, which are non-judgemental, empathetic alongside having the following too. Figure 6.4 Components of an AFHC Comprehensive Care provision covers promotive, preventive and curative aspect sEffective The right health services are provided in the right way, and make a positive contribution to their health.Appropriate Required care is provided and any unnecessary and harmful pract ices are avoided.Acceptable Health providers meet the expecta tion of adolescents who use th e services.Accessible Ready accessibility to AFHCs by adolescentsEquitable Services are provided to all adolescents who need them 172During the year 2020-21, 52 lakh adolescents registered with the AFHCs, which increased to 82 lakhs during the year 2021-22. On comparing the adolescents registered per lakh estimated population for two years it can be seen that there has been a phenomenal increase in the figures which has increased from 383 to 601 dur ing 2020-21 and 2021-22 (Table 6.1). The State/ UT-wise details are given at Annexure 6.3 & Annexure 6.4 . Most of the states have registered an increase in the registration o f adolescents at AFHCs except a few.

But, it can be seen that the percentage of girls registering at AFHC is more than Boys in both the years. As per the programme guidelines after the girls and boys regist er with an AFHC there is a provision to provide counselling or Clinical Services to t hese adolescents. Following table depicts the % of girls and boys receiving Clinical and Counselling services respectively during 2 years.

Recognizing the importance of this, school based health promoti on activities have been incorporated as a part of the He alth and Wellness component of the Ayushman Bharat Programme. School Health & Wellness Programme (launched in Feb 2020) is being implemented in government and government aided schools in selec t districts (including aspirational districts). Two teachers, preferably one male and one female, in every school, designated as \"Health and Wellness Ambassadors\" are trained to transact health promotion and disease prevention information on 11 thematic areas in the form of interesting joyful interactive activities for one hour every week to promote joyful learning among school children. Weekly Iron folic acid supplementation (WIFS) The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched the Week ly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (WIFS) Programme to meet the challenge of high prevalence of anaemia amongst adolescent girls a n d b o y s . W I F S i s e v i d e n c e b a s ed programmatic response to the prevailing anaemia situation amongst adolescent girls and boys through supervised weekly ingestion of IFA supplementation and biannual helminthic control. The long term goal is to break the intergenerational cycle of anaem ia, the short term benefit is of a nutritionally improved human capital. The programme, imple mented across the country both in rural and urban areas, for both in and out of school ad olescents. The interventions in the programme include: x Administration of supervised Wee kly Iron-folic Acid Supplements of 60 mg elemental iron and 500ug Folic acid using a fixed day approach. x Screening of target groups for mo derate/severe anaemia and refe rring these cases to an appropriate public health facility. x Biannual de-worming (Albendazole 400mg), six months apart, for control of helminthic infestation. x Information and counselling for improving dietary intake and fo r taking actions for prevention of intestinal worm infestation. The programme has been rolled out in all States/UTs. The progra mme covers 11.2 crore beneficiaries including 9.7 crore in-school and 1.5 crore out of school beneficiaries. Adolescents provided Iron Folic Acid Overall there has been increase in the number of adolescents pr ovided 4 IFA in 2021- 22 as compared to 2020-21, whereas a few states/ UTs have exhib ited i.e. Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha and Puducherry.

The major objectives of the scheme are: 1. To increase awareness among adolescent girls on Menstrual Hygie ne 2. To increase access to and use of high quality sanitary napkins to adolescent girls 3. To ensure safe disposal of sanitary napkins in an environmental ly friendly manner. For implementation of the Scheme, funds are now being provided to States/UTs under National Health Mission based on the proposals received from th em in their Programme Implementation Plans, for decentralized procurement of sanitary napkin packs. These are provided to the adolescent girls at a subsidized rate of Rs 6 f or a pack of 6 napkins by the ASHA, who is responsible for distribution, receiving an incenti ve @ Rs 1 per pack sold and a free pack of napkins every month for her own personal use. Sh e convenes monthly meetings at the Anganwadi Centres or other similar platforms fo r adolescent girls to focus on the issue of menstrual hygien e and other relevant SRH issues. The data for all these 3 indicators related to Menstrual H ealth Scheme is captured in th e HMIS. As per the data reported on HMIS, 14 Daman And Diu are not reporting any data for Adolescent Girls p rovided sanitary napkin packs during 2020-21.

D i a g n o s i s i s t h e f i r s t s t e p t o d i s e a s e m a n a g e m e n t , w h i c h h e l p s in accurate i d e n t i f i c a t i o n a n d t r e a t m e n t . T h e w o r d d i a g n o s i s h a s n o t p r o b a b ly received so much attention and acclaim as it has now, during a worldwide pandemi c, when detection and timely treatment have clearly em erged as the need of the hour Diagnosis helps improve patient care, contributes to protecting a patient's health and in some cases even helps limit healthcare spending. It is a medical procedure that involves testing a sample of blo od, urine, stool, sputum, tissues etc. Diagnostic services facilitate the provisi on of timely, cost effective & high quality diagnostic care in a safe & secure environment. It includes Clinical services of Pathology, Laboratory, medicine, radiology & nuclear medicine. Diagnostics are an integral part of the health care system, which provide information neede d by service providers to make informed decisions about care provision related to prevention, screening, detection, treatment and management. Currently HMIS captures data related to diagnostics services re lated of various procedures such as Hb test, HIV, RTI/STI, Syphilis, Widal test, X-ray and Ultrasound etc. Some of the HMIS data Items Analysis pertinent to the same is p rovided below: 7.1 Laboratory Investigations:- Lab investigations constitute an important part of diagnostic e valuation of any patient for gathering information and it is a known fact that with the help of investigation some underlying systematic conditions of patients can be identified which they were not aware of. Lab tests includes examination of Blood, urine and other s pecimens. From figure 7.1, it can be seen that the total Number of labora tory tests conducted and reported at the India level thro ughout the year shows an increa sing trend. Figure7.1 Increasing trend of Total Laboratory Investigation (i n Cr.) reported in HMIS at All India l evel data elements w.r.t Lab tests are captured in HMIS. Figure 7.2 s h o w s percentage of tests performed at hospital, where maximum number of tests have been conducted for Haemoglobin, which is more than 40% in Both FY 20 20-21 and 2021-22 followed by Malaria. Types of Lab test conducted and captured under HMIS is: 7.1.1 Malaria Test 7.1.6 RDT Test Figure7.2 Showing Percentage of Laboratory Investigations By Ty pe. 7.1.1 Haemoglobin (HB) A Haemoglobin test measures the levels of Haemoglobin in the bl ood. A protein in the red blood cells carries oxygen from lungs to the rest of th e body. If the haemoglobin levels are abnormal, it may be a sign of disorder in the body. The ranges given below : Table 1: Ranges of Anemia (in g/dl) 186Figure 7.3 Percentage of tested cases having Hb<7 (g/dl) above National average (3.07 for FY 2020-21 & 3.06 for FY 2021-22): Around 11.3 Crore and 8.3 Crore Hb tests were performed in FY 2 021-22 and FY 2020-21 respectively. State/ UT-wise details given in Annexure 7.3. In Figure 7.3 shows,12 states have reported higher than National average i.e. more than 3.07 percent during the FY 2020- 21 with Chandigarh being the highest at 8.22%, followed by Tela ngana at 6.38% and Jammu & Kashmir at 5.33% on the other hand, in FY 2021-22 Puduc herry, Telangana and Jammu & Kashmir has reported high number of anemic patients. Below graphs represents, States reporting less than the Nationa l average of 3.07%. In Fy 2021-22 Lakshadweep, Goa followed Manipur by exhibit lessening the anemia cases as compare to National Average. Wher eas, Tripura and Nagaland also shows major reduction in anemia cases compare to 2020-21.

The above Map represent the State reported HB less than 7. The State(s) reported more than 3.21% of tested cases shows in color red represent i.e. high nu mber of patients having anemia in comparisons to other State(s). 7.1.1.a Haemoglobin (Hb) tes ting For Pregnant Women:- Hb investigation during pregnancy is important factor of ANC. A nemia during pregnancy is a health problem affecting nearly half of all pregnant women wo rldwide. High fetal demands for iron renders iron deficiency, which is the most common caus e of anemia, with other micronutrient deficiencies co ntributing less frequently Abnormally high Hb concentrations during pregnancy usually indi cate poor plasma volume expansion, which also lead s to risks for certain adverse pregnancy outcomes as 188LBW along with premature births, stillbirths & Maternal Deaths. Early diagnosis may help in improving the haemoglobin levels well in time. Based on the data reported by States/ UTs on HMIS during 2020-2 1 & 2021-22, 67.9% and 70% of pregnant women respectively were tested for Hb out of Total ANC i.e. 3% of increment in testing over the year. Out of this, not more than 5% of pregnant women diagnosed with severe anaemia. State/ UT-wise data is given in Annexure 7.10 . Figure 7.6 Pregnant Women Tested for Anaemia Blood Sugar using OGTT Testing during pregnancy Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that is first seen i n a pregnant woman who d i d n o t h a v e d i a b e t e s b e f o r e s h e w a s p r e g n a n t . S o m e w o m e n h a v e more than one pregnancy affected by gestational diabetes. Gestational diabete s usually shows up in the middle of pregnancy. Doctors most often test for it between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. In such cases the blood glucose level (blood sugar) of the moth e r s t a y s h i g h (hyperglycemia) because she is unable to make and use all the i nsulin needed to support the demands of the pregnancy. The OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) is gold standard for dia gnosis of Gestational Diabetes Milletus (GDM) is done between 24 and 28 weeks of preg nancy. If a pregnant woman had a history of gestational diabetes before, an OGTT is done at the time of registration and then another OG TT at 24 to 28 weeks if the fir st test is normal. Based on the data reported on HMIS during 2021-22, 20.5% pregna nt women were tested for Blood sugar using OGTT which is 5% higher as compare to 15% in FY 2020-21. State/ UT-wise details are given in Annexure 7.2 . Figure 7.7 Maternal Diabetes During Pregnancy. 189In addition, at all India level ou t of those who were tested, 2 .5% PW found Positive for gestational diabetes in FY 2021-22 which is less than as comp are to 2.8% in FY 2020- 21. Figure 7.8 illustrates that Pudu cherry has reported the highest rate of PW found positive for Gestational diabetes in FY 2021-22 i.e. (18.9%) fo llowed by Kerala (11.30%) and Lakshadweep (8.09%) which also shows that the rate was increased as compare to last year in these States. The reduction can also be seen in An dhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in FY 2021-22 in comparison with 2020-21. Figure 7.8 Prevalence o f Gestational Diabetes for States/UTs wh ich have surpassed the National Average On the other hand, Uttarakhand has reported lowest rate (0.02%) of gestational diabetes followed by Tripura and Ladakh in FY 2021-22.

When it g oes untreated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). HIV testing, also called HIV screening, is the only way to know if you have the virus present in the body. Antibody test checks for antibodies specific to HIV in your blood or oral fluid. In gene ral, this test use blood from a vein which can detect HIV sooner after infection than tests don e with blood from a finger prick or with oral fluid. The State/UTs details are given at Annexure 7.6. Figure 7.10 Gender wise percentage of HIV tests. Based on reported data, at National Level in FY 2020-21 highest test performed on ANC female (57.54%), lowest test perf ormed on Non ANC female (18.96 %) followed by Male (23.49%) Whereas, in FY 2021-22, lowest test performed was on m ales (25.25%) followed by Non ANC Female (20.90%) whereas ANC Female (53.85%) is the h ighest.

Blood tests c an reveal if the body is making the antibodies to fight the infection. Syphilis tests can help diagnose syphilis in the early stages of infection, w hen the disease is easiest to t reat. Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR), a syphilis blood test that looks for antibodies to the s yphilis bacteria and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test is Tested Positive 192HMIS is capturing data for Male and female tested for syphilis. At National level 3.3% Males are found sero positive for Syphillis and 1.6% Non ANC Female i n FY 2021-22, which has been declined as compared to FY 2020-21. Figure 7.13 Male and Non-ANC Female tested and positive for S yphilis. Syphillis Testing during pregnancy Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the spir ochete bacterium Treponema Pallidum, subspecies Pallidum that may also be transm itted from mother to foetus during pregnancy or at birth resulting in congenital syp hilis. It can seriously complicate pregnancy and result in spontaneous abortion and sti llbirth. Stillbirths and early childhood mortality due to syphilis are c ontinually being reported each year. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that up to 1.5 million cases of syphilis in pregnancy occurs eac h year. Timely diagnosis and pr oper management of the infection in the pregnant woman are important in order to preve nt adverse outcome. Syphilis in pregnancy remains an important medical condition du e to its consequences. Timely diagnosis and treatment o f the disease is therefore very important.

H e a l t h c a r e d e l i v e r y i n I n d i a h a s b e e n e n v i s a g e d a t t h r e e l e v e l s namely Primary, Secondary and Tertiary. The seco ndary level of health care esse ntially includes Community Health Centres (CHCs), constituting the First Referral Units (F RUs) and the Sub-district and District Hospitals. The CHCs were designed to provide referral health care for cases from the Primary Health Centres level and for cases in need of specialis t care approaching the Centre directly. Figure 8.1 Tiered structure of P ublic Health Facilities in Indi a Medical College District Hospital/ Sub- district hospital Community Health Centre (CHC) 30 bed hospital/referral unit for 4 PHC with specilised services Primary Health Center ( PHC) A 4-6 bed referral unit for six sub-centers manned with a medical office in-charge & 14 subordinate paramedical staff. Sub Centre (SC) First point of contact for community in India's Primary Healthc are ecosystem, manned with one femal e health worker/ auxillary nurs e midwife and one male health worker. 213 A CHC is a 30-bedded hospital providing specialist care in Medi cine, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Surgery, Paediatrics, Dental and AYUSH. These cent res are however fulfilling the tasks entrusted to them only to a limited extent. First Referral Units (FRU) provi des comprehensive obstetric car e services including like cesarean section, newborn care, emergency care of sick children , full range of family planning services, safe abortion services treatment of STI/RTI availabil ity of blood storage unit and referral transport services. Num ber of FRUs has increased signi ficantly from 940 in 2005 to 1685 Functional F RUs in 2021-22 . Background: Reduction in Maternal Mortality rate is the stated goal for Nat ional Population Policy, National Health Policy and Tenth Five Year Plan and is also one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) to which the country is a signatory and has to respond. The Maternal mortality in India con tinues to remain unacceptably high. Historical evidence at the global level has demonstrated that it is possible to bring down maternal mortality effectively if a package of obstetric services is provided within reach of the communities and the families. It is in this context that efforts were initiated in 1992 with the implementation of the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood (CSSM) Programme with assistance f rom World Bank and UNICEF for upgrading the existing community health centers and sub-district hospitals intoFirst Referral Units (FRUs), to be equipped for providing d elivery of emergency obstetric care to pregnant women with complications. 214 Over the years, a number of steps have been taken under the RCH Programme for facilitating the operationalisation of these FRUs. These have included funds for operationalising Operation Theatre (OTs) and Labour Rooms (LRs) , supply of equipment kits, supply of drug kits containing e mergency obstetric care drugs a nd funds for hiring of Anaesthetists from private sector . Drugs and Cosmetics Rules ha ve also been amended to enable setting up of Blood Storage Units in the institutions de signated as First Referral Units (FRUs). The Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) at the National level continu es to be above 178 per 100,000 live births. The MMR in many major states particula rly those, which are part of the Empowered Action Group (EAG), is much above the National av erage. This situation is a major cause of concern and it is imperative that focused effort s have to be made for making the First Referral Units fully operational, in case we have to meet the National objective of bringing down the MM R to less than 100. An existing facility i.e. district hospital, sub-divisional hos pital, Community Health Centre etc. can be declared fully operational First Referral Un it (FRU) only if it is equipped to provide round the clock services for Emergency Obstetric and New Born Care, in addition to all emergencies that any hospital is required to provide. Designated FRUs in India (as marked in HMIS) HMIS has a provision for marking a facility as First Referral Unit (FRU) in the facility master. As per the marking of facilities as FRU in the HMIS Fac ility Master, at All India level during 2020-21 3376 facilities have been marked as First Referr al Unit, whereas during 2021- 22 the number has increased to 3559. It can be seen that the share of District Hospitals and Sub Dis trict Hospitals marked as FRU have increased during 2021-22 from 677 in 2020-21 to 807 in 2021-22 and for SDH the number has increased from 891 in 2020-21 to 944 in 2021-22. Fig 8.2: Number State wise facility type wise brea kup of FRU reveals that in 4 States/ UTs i.e. Goa, Manipur, Puducherry, Sikkim all the FRU facilities are at District Hospi tal level only but no lower level facility has been marked as FRU d uring the year 2020-21.

NHM focuses on decentralized health planning, service delivery, creating knowledge hubs within district hospitals, strengthening seconda ry level care at district hospitals, expanding outreach services, improving community pro cesses and behaviour change communication, human reso urces development, public healt h management, and Health Management Information System (HMIS). Out Patient Department (OPD) services plays an important role i n measurement and availability of the various key h ealth services at facility lev el. After the implementation of Ayushmaan Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres, the range of OPD services has been extended even upto Sub Centre level. In HMIS, the data of OPD services is captured in the form of Ou tpatients for Diabetes, Hypertension, Stroke (Paralysis), Acute Heart Diseases, Mental Illness, Epilepsy, Ophthalmic, Dental, and Oncology etc. at the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary levels. Figure 9.1 Year wise comparison of total OPDs 178.22 Cr 113.74 Cr143.89 by States/ UTs in HMIS portal has been an alyzed for the year 2020- 21 and 2021-22 with respect to the total OPD cases and individu al contribution of the different facility level has been observed. It is noted that du ring the year 2020-21 at National Level SCs, PHCs, CHCs, and 15% of total OPDs respectively, whereas almost the same tre nd has been observed for the year 2021-22 as 16.7%, 31.9%, 19.4%, 15.6% However, at PHC and SDH level the re is decline of 2.8% and 1% o f OPD cases, whereas at DH there is 1% increase in the year 2021-22 w.r.t 2020-21. T he State/ UT wise OPD services provided by each facility type during year 2020-21 and 2021-22 are represented under Figure 9.1a DH 226Top 5 o the highest percentage of OPD to Total OPD- facility wise in FY 2020-21 and 2021-22 (Table 9.1 & Table 9.2 OPD Services per Doctor per year at Public Health Facilitie s (excluding medical college) HMIS data for the OPD cases (Allopathic + AYUSH) and the number of doctors reported against the health facilities for the year 2020-21 and 2021-22 has been analyzed at each facility level to get the inferen ce about the number of OPD cas es catered by per doctor per year. The State/ UT-wise number of OPD cases per doctor per year PHCs, CHCs, SDH & DHs for the year 2020-21 and is represented under Annexure 9.1 2279.2 a. Primary Healt h Centres (PHCs): PHC is the first physical point of contact between Patient and the Doctor, therefore OPD services play imp ortant role towards the preliminary diagnosis as well the further referral to the highe r level of health facilities, wherever required. 9.2 b. Community Health Centres (CHCs): CHCs caters to essential services including preventive, promotive, curative, palliative, rehabilitative ser vices along with the mandate to provide specialized care which is offered through specialist s (physicians, surgeons, obstetricians, pediatricians, and anesthesiologists etc.). 9.2 c. Sub District/ Divisional Hospital (SDH): SDH have a mandate to provide secondary care services and acts as Referral Units for the Tehs il/Taluk/Block population in which they are geographically located and SDHs are below the district and above the block level (CHC) hospitals. SDHs form an important link between SCs, PHCs and CHCs on one end and District Hospitals on the other end. They also s ave travel time for cases needing emergency care and reduce the workload of the district hospitals. States/ UTs like A & N Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kash mir, Ladakh, have no serving SDHs. For Meghalaya there was no facility mapped under SDH during 2020-21, whereas during 2021-22 there are two facilities mapped as SDH. Also, one SDH under Manipur has not reported any OPDs duri ng 2020-21. 9.2 d. District Hospital (DH): As per the defined guidelines every DH should comprehensively f unction for providing secondary care services along with the critical care services l ike Emergency, High Dependency Unit (HDU)/Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Operation Thea tre (OT), Labour Delivery, Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU), lab and diagnostic services etc. District Hospital has specialist OPD services in order to cater for the specific need of the population for the respective district. 2289.2 e. State/ UT wise analysis a t PHC, CHC, SDH and DH level fo r the year 2020-21 and 2021-22 are as follows: Year Average OPD at All India level Range of OPD cases per doctor per year across the States/ UTs No. of States / UTs with lesser OPD than the N ational average No. of States/ UTs with more OPD 17178 145 - 11749 516 - 28410 23 24 20 24 13 12 8 12 2021- 22 9973 8474 9176 21221 897 - 10462 24 24 21 28 12 12 7 8 9.2 f. Top five States catering to the maximum OPD per doctor p er year for each level of public health faci lities during 2020-21 and 2021- 22: For the year Nadu contributed in all four ca tegories, Kerala and Rajasthan have contributed in three categories, whereas Madhya Pradesh and Puducherry have contributed in two categories of health facilities among t he top performer States with respect to OPD cases per doctor per year. Whereas for the year 2021-22, Tamil Nadu and Kerala contributed in all four categories and Rajasthan & P uducherry contributed in three & two categories respectively. The States/ UTs highlighted in specific colors representing in particular health facility category may be referred in Table 9.3 (2020-21) and Table 9.4 ( 2021-22). Table 9.3 Primary Health Centre Community Health Centre Sub District Hospital District Hospital Tamil Nadu Kerala 9.4 Primary Health Centre Community Health Centre Sub District Hospital District Lab Investigations plays importa nt role in the healthcare system which help the service providers to make decisions about care provision related to the prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment or management of the illness at primary, secondary and tertiary level of health facilities. The facility of the La b investigations is available from the level of PHCs to DHs, as the functional Laboratory is avail able along with the required HR and Infrastructure. However, at the level of SC few lab test s are available which does not require an equipped lab and can be performed by HW (F) or H W (M). The facilities for certain important lab tests is available round the clock in the SDH & DH which provides the emergency services. Under HMIS the various Lab investigations like Hb tests conduct ed, HIV Tests for male and female (ANC & non-ANC), STI/ RTI attendees tested for syphilis, Widal tests, X-ray, USG etc. are being captured depending upon the level of the hea lth facility. The comparison of total Lab Tests conducted during 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 may be seen in Figure 9.2 , which clearly gives inference that the decrease in number of la b tests during the year 2020-21 is due to the covid-19 pandemic. 230 The current analysis has been done based on the number of Lab t ests done during the year 2020-21 and 2021-22. It is noted that during the year 2020 -21 at National Level PHCs, CHCs, SDHs & DHs caters to total Lab Tests of 13.5%, 15.3 %, 26.5% and 44.7% respectively, whereas almost the same trends have been observed for the year 2021-22 as 12.3%, 15%, 27.7% and 45% of Lab Tests respectively. At the PHC level there is the decline of 1.2% in Lab Tests, whereas at SDH there is 1.2% incr ease in the year 2021- 22 w.r.t 2020-21.

Health system inputs (infrastructur e, health workers, drugs, equipment, health information system and finances) are combined to provide quality health services that are equitable, accessible, affordable and responsive to the needs of the population. District Hospitals come under the secondary health care services which are responsible for providing comprehensive health care services in a defined geographical area containing a defined population. The facility should provi d e a s e t o f E s s e n t i a l (Minimum Assured Services) and Desirable services such as New-b orn services, Pshycharitic services, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation ser vices, Accident and Trauma services, Dialysis services, Anti-retroviral therapy and Patient Safety and Infection control. The services of District hospital have three pillars: clinical care, a knowledge hub for PRIMARY TERTIARY India's 3 tiered Public health system Basic Healthcare Services x Sub centres (SCs) x Primary Health Centres (PHCs) Intermediate Healthcare services x Community Health Centres x Sub- District Hospitals x District Hospitals Advanced Healthcare services x Medical colleges x Specialised intensive care units x Advanced diagnostic services 239 capacity development of HR in health and public health programm e to ensure the continuum of care and reduce the disease burden. x Clinical Care: includes curative, palliative and rehabilitative services along with services for implementation of national programmes, provision o f drugs, administrative services and other support services. The service s to be provided at different facilities are identified as 'Essential' and 'Desi rable'. \u0083 Essential services -includes those ' minimum assured services' that every facility at that level must provide. \u0083 Desirable services are those that a facility should aspire to u ltimately achieve (if not already being provided) over a period of time i n a phased manner. x Knowledge hub: providing services like medical courses including Diplomate of National Board, nursing schools, ANM training and a resource ce ntre equipped with computers, information resources and telemedicine capabili ty. x Continuum of Care: To ensure continuum of care, assured referra l with facility readiness to manage referred cases must be established. Key elements of district hospitals: 1. Affordability-Provide effective, affordable health care services (curative including specialist services, preventive, and promotive) for a defined p opulation 2. Accessibility- At least one district hospital for every distric t providing advanced secondary care and certain critical care services like emergenc y, High dependency unit (HDU), special New-born care unit (SNCU), lab and imaging servi ces, et c. need t o be prioritised. 3. Extensive coverage- Service coverage encompassing both urban (d istrict headquarter town) and the rural popul ation in the district. 4. Broad scope- Provide wide-rangin g technical and administrative support and education and training for primary health care. Importance of District Hospitals: When any patient reaches any nearby district hospital, they exp ect the following service s from the District hospitals OPD They expect a doctor in the required medical specialty in the outpatient department (OPD) to diagnose and treat their health disorder and prescribe tests and medicines, Pharmacy T h e m e d i c i n e s prescribed by the doctor can then be obtained at the pharmacy in the hospital.Diagnostics I f t h e d o c t o r orders diagnostic tests, the patient can get them done at a laboratory by a technician at that particular point of care. IPD I f t h e d o c t o r recommends admission, the patient can get a bed at the hospital..Surgery If a higher-level medical intervention, such as surgery, is suggested, the patient can be operated upon within a reasonable period of time. Intensive Care D u r i n g t h e patient's stay at the hospital, they are cared by the on-duty nurses. After the surgery, the patient should recover without any infection 240 The unavailability and inaccessibility of these health care ser vices at public h o s p i t a l s a d v e r s e l y i m p a c t t h e h e a l t h o u t c o m e s a n d o v e r a l l r e p u tation of public hospitals in the country. So, it is important to conduct p r e l i m i n a r y evaluation for the performance of all district hospitals at a regular interval of time in order to improve the hea lth care delivery system. Under taking such an exercise at a regular time perio d will help foster a sense of h ealthy competition between the individual district hospitals and provide them an o pportunity to showcase progress against relevant indicators. For monitoring the progress of health facility, Government of I ndia has developed a web based portal named Health Management Informatio n System (HMIS) which captures facility w ise data related to service del ivery and infrastructure. In service delivery Reproductive, Maternal and Child Health related, Immunisation family planning, Vector borne disease, Tuberculosis, Morbidity and Mortality, OPD, IPD Services, Surgeries etc. data are captured on monthly basis whereas in infrastructure, Manpower, Equipment, C leanliness, Building, Availability of Medical Services such as Surgery, Sup er Specialties services, Diagnostics, Para Medical and Clinical Services data are captured on annual basis. In this chapter, a comparative analysis of few indicators of go vernment district hospital (except Medical colleges) has been done for two consec utive financial years 2020-21 and 2021-22. The indicators are: Average function al bed occupancy rate, Bed occupancy ra te, C-section rate, Rate of ini tiation of breastfeeding, Blood replacement rate and Post- surgical site i nfection. The data reported on the HMIS portal was taken as a source of comparativ e analysis, and the data of district hospital in the financial year 2020-21 was taken as a base to compare the states performance w ith 2021-22 performance. In thi s analysis, medical colleges are excluded in the list of district hospitals . The details of Districts Hospitals are shown below: I. Number of district hospitals in the country In the financial year 2020-21, there were overall 818 (excludin g medical colleges) district hospitals in the country, which rose to 827 (excluding medical colleges) in the financial year 2021-22. The below map represents the number of district hospitals present in the each state of the c ountry in the financial year 2021-22. 241 Figure 10.1 Number of Dist rict hospitals as on 31st March 22 II. Distribution of District hospita ls based on the bed strength National Health Policy, 2017 recommends two beds per 1000 population. It is therefore proposed that the provision of one bed per 1000 popul ation is an 'Essential' norm for every district while two beds per 1000 is a target they should aspire towards 'Desirable'. The 'Essential' number of beds in a district should be provided through the public health system of tertiary care ( Medical Colleges), secondary ca re (DH, SDH and selected CHCs) and primary care (PHCs and remaining CHCs). 'Des irable' number of beds, the contribution of the private sector (based on the acce ss to private health care in the local area), Railways, Armed Forces, Power Grid, Co al fields, Employees' State Insurance (ESI) and other Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) hospitals may also 242 be considered while continuing to strengthen and increase bed p rovision at public health facilities. In 2022, Indian Public Health standards have developed guideli nes to strengthen the essential and desirable beds based on the size of population se rve by the district hospitals. These guidelines are helpful as it provides a system atic basis for identifying resources required at the DH acco rding to the size of the facil ity. Depending upon the bed occupancy and local health needs, states can propose mo re beds to achieve IPHS norms. The norms for bed strength are as follows: Population Essential beds Desirable beds Less than 2 lakh 50 beds+15 additional (Emergency and day care beds) 100 Between2-5lakh 100 beds+25 additional (Emergency and day care beds) 200 Between 5-10 lakh 200 beds+38 additional (Emergency and day care beds) 300 Between 10-20 lakh 300 beds+49 additional (Emergency and day care beds) 400 Between 20-30 lakh 400 beds+ 60 additional (Emergency and day care beds) 500 More than30 lakhs 500 beds+55 additional (Emergency and day care beds) 600 Figure 10.2 Distribution of District hospital as per availabili ty of beds (as on 31st March 22) As per data reported on HMIS in the financial year 2021-22, it can be seen that the number of district hospital having bed strength 100 or less tha n 100 is 292 at all India level .The number of distr ict hospitals are decreasing wi th raising number of 243 bed strength. There are merely 14 district hospitals at all ove r country having bed strength above 700. 1. Availability of functional beds in District Hospitals: A hospital bed constitutes the primary unit of any hospital i nfrastructure. The number of functional hospital beds is of fundamental importance to both the patients and staff. This indicator is largely under the control of the s tate. It refers to hospital beds which are regularly maintained and staffed and immediately available for the care of admitted patients. This indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of fu nctional beds present in district hospital in a month by the total number of District ho spital in the area. Significance x A shortage of available beds can seriously impact functionality of a hospital as it is the primary cause of denial of admission, surgery cancell ations, and delays in emergency admissions. Conversely, excess bed capacity may lead to additional costs and stagnant capital. x Identifying resource allocation, such as requirement of staff, support services, diagnostic testing facilities. Figure 10.3 shows that average bed availability in the mos t of the states remains same in both the financial years (2020-21 and 2021-22) except s ome few states. In the financial 2020-21, average bed availability in Rajasthan and Ka rnataka was 320 & 322 which decline to 298 and 319 in the financial year 2021-22. Sim ilar decline in the number of average functional availability bed can be seen in harashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Jharkhand, Nadu, Haryan a, Tripura and Mizoram remains same in both of these financial years. Average functional bed availability = Total number of functional beds in District hospitals in a mo nth Number of District hospitals 244 Figure 10.3 State/UT wise average availability of functional be ds in Government District Hospitals during 31st March 2021 and 31st M arch 2022 2. Bed Occupancy Rate: Bed occupancy rate helps in determining the efficiency of a dis trict hospital. It reflects efficiency in the use of hospital beds. The bed occupancy rate is calculated by dividing the total numb er of inpatients headcounts at midnight added for a year by the number of functi onal beds available in the District hospital multiplied by 365 days. The ratio is mult iplied by 100 to express the figure in percentage. The bed occupancy rate shows the effectiv e utilization of available beds in a hospital. An optimal bed occupancy rate is between 80 and 85 percent, at which point a facility will run most effectively. According to IPHS recommendatio ns from 2012, district hospitals should have 80% of their beds occupied. Bed Occupancy Rate = Total number of inpatients headcount at midnight added for a year\u00d7100 Total functional beds in District Hospital\u00d7365 245 Significance The bed occupancy rate aids in identifying facilities with the best resource utilization rates from the perspective of public health planning as high be d occupancy rate reflects the good quality of services, inf rastructure, tra ined staff, pa tient care and satisfaction provided by the facility whereas low bed occupancy rates (<42%) at primary health care level indicated lack of medically trained personnel, spora dic supply of drugs and other medical supplies and a comp lete breakdown in the transfer and referral system. x Hospitals cannot operate at 100% occupancy, as spare bed capaci ty is needed to accommodate variations in demand. Lack of available beds increa se delays in emergency departments, cause patients to be placed on clinically inappropriate wards and increase the rate of hospital-acquired infections. Th is also puts staff under pressure to free up beds that can pose a risk to patient safety. x Utilizing the indicator, hospitals can evaluate their performan ce and identify opportunities for development. The reasons for the respective l evel of utilization can be identified and future decisions can be made based upon this. x This indicator can be further used for comparison among facili ties at the state/region/national level and help to find out their efficien cy. The below figure no 10.4 shows the bar graph which compares the bed occupancy rates of all states in the fina ncial year 2020-21 and 2021-22. The red highlighted bars represent the states having bed occupancy rate less than the na tional average (which is highlighted in green colour) whereas blue colour horizontal bar s represent the states having bed occupancy rate higher than the national average. The given chart shows that there are overall 26 states which ha s bed occupancy rate lower than the national average. It can be clearly seen that, i n the both the financial years, Arunachal Pradesh and Andaman and Nicobar Island have lo west bed occupancy rate whereas Odisha has highest bed occupancy rate in both thes e financial years (2020-21 & 2021-22). 246 Figure 10. 4 State/UTs wise comparison of average bed occupancy rate in Govt. District Hospitals during financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22 247 3. C-section rate: A caesarean section is a form of childbirth in which a surgical incision is made through mother's abdomen and uterus into deliver one or more babies. It was introduced in clinical practice as a lifesaving procedure both for the mother and the baby. C-section deliveries are absolutely critical to save lives in situations where vaginal deliveries would pose risks, so all hea lth systems must ensure timely access for all women when needed. C-section rate is calculated by dividing the number of Caesarea n section deliveries performed in a year with the tot al number of deliveries in the year. The figure is multiplied by 100 in order t o express it in percentage. C-section rate = Number of C-section deliveries performed in the year \u00d7 100 Total number of deliveries in the year (Normal + Assisted Deliveries + C Section) The cases that come to district hospitals are often emergency o r complicated cases. A surgical procedure cannot be avoided in such cases. As per the WHO report, \"At population level, C-section rate s higher than 10% are not assoc iated with reductions in maternal and new born mortality rates. A district hospital would receive multiple complicated cases of pregnancy that require pe rforming C-section surgery. The WHO states that every effort should be made to pro vide caesarean sections to women in need, rathe r than striving to achieve a sp ecific rate. Significance x C-section deliveries are absolutely critical to save lives in s ituations where vaginal deliveries would pose risks, so all health systems must ensure timely access for all women when needed. x Both extremely low and extremely high rates of C-section delive ries pose adverse effects within maternal health care, and therefore, obs erving the trend of the C-section rate is cruci al in identifying its reasons. x C-section deliveries are associated with longer hospital stays, delayed initiation of breastfeeding and higher out- of-pocket expenses due to longe r duration of stay. x A high rate of C-section deliver ies can be associated with both short- and long- term risks which can extend for many years beyond the current d elivery and affect the health of the woman, her child, and future pregnanci es. The below map depicts the comparative analysis of C-section rat e in all states of the country in the financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22. In the finan cial year 2020-21, C- section rate at national level was around 27% which rose to 28. 8% in the next financial year 2021-22. 248 Overall, in the financial year 2021-22, C-section rate has incr eased in the most of the Indian states except some states such as Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Nicobar island have lowest C-section rate in the both the financial years whereas Tamil Nadu has highest C-section rate (56%) in the financial year 2020-21 and Telangana (53.5%) has highest C -section rate in the financial year 2021-22. Figure 10.5 Average percentage of C-section deliveries in Govt. district hospital of State/UTs during financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22 4. Rate of early initiation of breastfeeding: Early initiation of breastfeeding, within one hour of birth, pr otects the new-born from acquiring infection and reduces new-born mortality. It facilita tes emotional bonding of the mother and the baby and has a positive impact on duration o f exclusive breastfeeding. When a mother initiates breastfeeding within one hour after birth, production of breast milk is stim ulated. The yellow or golden first milk produced in the first days, also called colostrum, is an important source of nu trition and immune protection for the new-born. The rate of early initiation of breastfeeding is calculated by dividing the total number of 249 new-borns breastfeed within 1 ho ur of birth by total number of live births. The figure is multiplied by 100 in order t o express it in percentage. Rate of early initiation of breastfeeding = Total no. of new-borns breast feed within 1 hr of birth \u00d7 100 Total number of live births Significance x Early initiation of breastfeedin g has different health benefits like increase ability to defense infections, reduce the risk of diarrhea, and increas e the survival rate of children. x Neonatal mortality can be prevented by 33% if early initiation of breastfeeding is practiced by mothers. The below bar graph compares the rate of initiation of breastfe eding in all states of the country in the financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22. As seen from the graph, the red highlighted bars represent the s tates having rate of initiation of breastfeeding lower than the national average. The national average of (which is highlighted in green color) rate of initiation of breastfeed ing is 89.6 and 90 percent in t he financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22.The states having rate of initiation of breasting i s higher than the national average is represented by blue color. From the figure no 10.6 it is clearly seen that, Delhi has the lowest rate of initiation of breastfeeding while Lakshadweep a nd Mizoram has highest rate of breastfeeding in the financial year 2020-21. 250 Figure 10.6 Average rate of earl y initiation of breastfeeding i n public district hospitals of State/UTs during the financial year 2020-21 and 20 21-22 5. Blood Bank Replacement Rate In this indicator, blood units issued in a year includes volunt ary donation replacement. Number of blood units issued on replacement donation means that a patient's attendant is being asked to give blood units, for getting blood from the blood bank. Replacement needs to be phased out as the replacement donor has a chance of higher sero-positivity (giving a positive result in a t est of blood serum, e.g. for th e presence of a virus.) 251 It is calculated by dividing the total number of blood units is sued on replacement in the year by the total number of blood units issued in that year and then multiplied by 100 . This indicator has negative valence, implying that lower the sc ore, better the performance. Blood bank replacement rate = Total number of blood units issued on replacement in the year \u00d7 100 Total number of blood units issued in year This indicator measures the ability of the hospital to provide as well as manage the supply of blood from low-risk donors . Significance x This indicator measures the ability of the hospital to provide as well as manage the supply of blood from low-risk donors. x This indicator helps in identifying how much voluntary replacem ents are made a n d h o w m a n y a r e p a i d . I n a n i d e a l s i t u a t i o n t h e b l o o d b a n k s h o uld be replenished with voluntary donat ions rather than asking the pat ient's caretakers to replace the blood units being issued to the patie nt. x This indicator is to encourage voluntary donations and maintain a replenished blood bank. The spirit is not to refuse blood units by the pati ents' caretakers when issued, but also not insist upon replacing the blood units issued. 252 Figure 10.7: Average blood replacement rate in Govt. district hospitals of States/UTs during the financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22 The above chart reflects the blood replacement rate of all stat es in the financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22. Overall, there are 20 states /UTs whi ch have blood replacement lower than the national average. The national average of blood replacement in the financial year 2020-21 was 25.3% which rose to 26.8%in the next financial year 2021-22 which ind icates blood replacement score going downwards. In Andaman and Nicobar islands for this indicator there was no data reported on HMIS portal. 253 Apart of this, as per reported data on HMIS, Tamil Nadu state i s performing quite impressive in this indicator. As in the financial year 2020-21, 30,294 blood units and in the financial year 2021-22, 34,477 blood units are issued by Govt. district hospitals but in replacement they have zero reported data. 6. Surgeries Surgery is the branch of medicine that deals with the physical manipulation of bodily structure to diagnose, prevent or cure diseases. Due to increase in traumatic injuries, cancers, and many othe r diseases, surgical interventi ons on public health systems are also growing. Also at many instances, surgeries are the only intervention that alleviates disabilities and reduce the risk o f deaths from various ailments. Generally the patients are referr ed to District Hospitals or FR Us for surgical treatment related to trauma, obstetric, abdominal, orthopedic e mergencies etc. Therefore, surgical department should have surgical specialists available in these facilities for providing quality of surgical and acute care to patients. If there is, unavailability of apparatus, drugs, and various other essential supplies, it limits the good quality of surgical care. Overall 32 lakh surgeries were p erformed in financial year 2020 -21 which rose to 37 lakh in next financial year 2021-22. The graph given below comp ares the operation major, operation minor and C -section surgeries performed during the financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22. Figure 10.8 Average Percentage o f various surgeries conducted a t govt. district hospitals across all ov er the country during the finan cial year 2020- 21 and 2021-22 It can be seen from the graph that there is a slight change in the proportion of surgeries performed during the financial year 2020-21 and 2021- 21.In the financial year 2020-21 , 56% surgeries comes under operation minor and th e rest 21% and 23% comes under C section and operation major. In the next fina ncial year 2021- 254 22, proportion of operation minor and operation major reaches t o 57% and 24% whereas the percentage of C section during performed decline fr om 21% to 19% during the financial year 2020-21. 7. Post-surgical site infection Surgical site infection (SSI) is an infection related to an ope rative procedure that occurs at or near the surgical incision within 30 days of the p rocedure, or within 90 days if prosthetic material is implanted at surgery. Sometimes be superficial infections involving the skin only. Other surgical site infecti ons are more serious and can involve tissues under the skin, organs, or implanted materi al. It is calculated by dividing total number of cases developed su rgical site infection to total surgeries performed. The figure is multiply by 100. Post-surgical site infection = Total number of cases developed SSI \u00d7 100 Total surgeries performed In total surgeries addition of operation major, operation minor a n d C s e c t i o n surgeries is done as SSI can develop also after C-section deliv ery. Significance - x SSIs occur in 2% to 4% of all patients undergoing inpatient surgical procedures. Risk factors for SSI include patient factors (such as age, tobacco use, diabetes, and malnutrition) and procedure-specific risk fa ctors (including emergency surgery and the degree of bacterial contamination of the surgical wound at the time of the procedure). x SSIs remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality afte r surgery. They are the leading cause of readmissions to the hospital foll owing surgery, and approximately 3% of patients who contract an SSI will die a s a consequence. The below chart shows the average percentage of post-surgical i nfection in the all states/UTs of the country during the financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22.The national average (highlighted green bar) for post-surgical infe ction rate in the financial year 2020-21 is 0.34% which rose to 0.4 % in the next financial year 2021-21. The lowest post infection rate is found in Manipur and Lakshadweep in the financial year 2020-21. 255 Figure 10.9 Average Percent of p ost-surgical infection in Govt. district hospital of State/UTs during the financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22 256 Conclusion District hospitals cater to a wide spectrum of the population, including people from neighbouring states and districts, depending on its ease of acc essibility. The service delivery, maintenance of records and accurate data reporting ar e equally important to assess the performance of the hospitals and analyse their ou tputs and outcomes. District hospitals that had adopted digitized data reporting fo rmats and had a dedicated staff to monitor data not only fared better in the pe rformance assessment but also were able to utilize the data for internal decision-making and output improvement. Based on the analysis of these health indicators, among bigger states, bed occupancy rate was highest in Odisha in both the financial year (2020-21 & 2021- 22), and in smaller states and UTs Tripura and Ladakh were high est bed occupancy rate. Moving towards the lowest performing states in bed occupa ncy rates were Jammu & Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh and Andaman and Nicobar isla nds among the bigger, smaller states and UTs for both the financial years (2020-21 & 2021- 22). Considering C -section rate among bigger states, Tamil Nadu con ducted 56% and 52% in the financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22 which the highest percentage of C - section rate in the bigger states . In smaller states and UTs, G oa and Lakshadweep conducted highest percentage of C -section in-comparison to oth er smaller states and UTs. Apart of this, in Blood replacement rate, among bigger states, Tamil Nadu was the ideal state for blood replacement rate during both these financ ial year (2020-21 & 2021-22) and in UTs, Chandigarh (7.1% in financial year 2020-21 & 1 2 . 9 % i n financial year 2021-22) and in sm aller states, Mizoram (5.6% in financial year 2020- 21 & 5.1% in financial year 2021-22) performed best in terms of blood replacement rate. Furthermore, the performance of UTs in rate of initiation of br eastfeeding is quite impressive during these financial years. All UTs have breastfeeding rate higher than 90%. Additionally, among bigger st ates of the country, the rate of initiation of breasting in one hour was lowest in Govt. district hospital of Delhi and highest in Govt. district hospitals of Kerala during the whole financial y ear of 2020-21 & 2021- 22.
