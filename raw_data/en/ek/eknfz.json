Principles of Integrative Medicine Integrative medicine, as defined by the American Board of Integrative Medicine\u00ae (ABOIM) and the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine, is the practice of medicine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals, and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing. Specifically, these guiding principles include: - A belief in the benefits of interprofessional collaboration and openness to new ideas and approaches that help achieve better health outcomes - Partnering with patients in a context of open and honest communication and mutual respect - Using the power of the therapeutic relationship to support the healing process and to co-design a treatment plan that matches patients' preferences and abilities - Seeking to understand and address the context of illness, healing and wellness including the social, psychosocial, environmental, community, physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of the patient's life - Focusing on prevention, wellness and patient health education, emphasizing the role of patient participation and self-care in both healing and prevention - Taking the time to focus on what is needed on a step by step basis, utilizing effective interventions that are natural and less invasive as the first line of treatment Recognizing Faculty Achievements Arya Nielsen, PhD - Assistant Clinical Professor at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Department of Family Medicine & Community Health.
