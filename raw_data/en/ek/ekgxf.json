If you are suffering musculoskeletal pain conditions due to disease, injury or trauma, we recommend realignment of your spine through adjustment and manipulation techniques to alleviate chronic pain caused by nerve compression. In addition, adjustments also keep your body systems operating at peak efficiency by improving and supporting central nervous system functioning. Chiropractic Care and Pain Relief Non-invasive and drug-free, chiropractic techniques not only ease back and neck pain but can also address many other medical conditions, including: - Bulging or herniated discs - Auto Injuries - Sciatica - Chronic migraines - Muscle strains, sprains, tension and inflammation - Sports injuries Specific treatments prescribed by Eric Shaver depends on the underlying cause of your pain. Chiropractic practitioners do not believe in the traditional \"one size fits all\" treatments offered by your primary care physician. That's why we take all the time necessary to accurately evaluate and diagnose your symptoms so we can develop a customized treatment plan that focuses on you as a whole person and not just as a symptom. What to Expect During Your First Visit As a patient of Allied Chiropractic and Eric Shaver, you will receive an in-depth explanation about how chiropractic treatments work to stabilize a dysfunctional central nervous system. In addition to adjustments and manipulations, we will also explain how spinal decompression can relieve severe pressure on discs separating your vertebrae. Spinal decompression not only alleviates debilitating pain caused by herniated discs and sciatica but may also help people suffering migraines, neck pain and numerous other disorders associated with impaired CNS functioning. We may also suggest lifestyle and nutritional counseling to complement chiropractic care depending on your health issues. People suffering autoimmune diseases often find a combination of these treatments bring welcome relief to symptoms that simply do not respond to prescription drugs. Welcome to Allied Chiropractic!
