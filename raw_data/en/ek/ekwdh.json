Aimee Pierce, M.D., associate professor of neurology, OHSU School of Medicine The two strongest risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are age and genetics, but there is hope for Alzheimer's prevention, even if we can't turn back the clock. In fact, many other risk factors for Alzheimer's disease have been identified, including diet, exercise, and sleep. Novel clinical trials which combine lifestyle interventions or test new pharmacological treatments, such as lecanemab, the newest drug approved on January 6 of this year by the FDA, may provide a basis for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in the future. [Dr. Aimee Pierce](https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/aimee-l-pierce-md), associate professor of neurology and Director of Clinical Care and Therapeutics in the Layton Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Center, will give a tour of the landscape of Alzheimer's disease prevention.

Christopher Kroenke, Ph.D., professor, Advanced Imaging Research Center and Oregon National Primate Research Center's Division of Neuroscience, OHSU In the second half of pregnancy, the brain of a fetus grows dramatically. During this time the outer surface changes from smooth to the folded, wrinkled appearance we typically associate with brains. Meanwhile, the cells inside the brain are growing, dividing and changing shapes. Is there a connection between these two processes, and could such a link help determine whether a person develops a neurological disorder? In celebration of OHSU Research Week, [Christopher Kroenke, Ph.D.](https://www.ohsu.edu/advanced-imaging-research-center/christopher-d-kroenke-phd), will share his research using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to observe fetal brain growth and cell changes. Thanks to the safety and advancement of MRI it's possible to watch these changes over time with the goal of developing new strategies for predicting neurological disorders. May 12, 2022 | 4 p.m. PT | Micronutrients for mental health: Exploring the impact of vitamins and minerals on ADHD, anxiety, stress and mood disorders Jeni Johnstone, Ph.D., clinical psychologist and assistant professor of Psychiatry, Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, OHSU It's no secret that eating well can improve your physical health, but a good diet is just as important for your mental health, a fact our ancestors knew. Over the decades our diets have deteriorated along with the understanding of how nutrition affects mental health. Some people can maintain good mental wellness with a healthy diet. But for others, eating a healthy diet is not enough and nutrient supplementation is necessary. Join OHSU assistant professor Jeni Johnstone, Ph.D., for a journey into what we've known and are re-learning about nutrition's impact on mental health, and hear the latest research on how vitamin and mineral supplements impact a range of mental health conditions. May 18, 2022 | 4 p.m. PT | The computer-connected brain: 21st century treatment of epilepsy and brain cancer Ahmed Raslan, M.D., associate professor of Neurological Surgery; director of Epilepsy and Brain Mapping, OHSU Join neurosurgeon [Ahmed Raslan, M.D.,](https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/ahmed-m-raslan-md-faans) for a fascinating look at the future of awake brain surgery and how new technology promises better results for people with treatment-resistant epilepsy. Raslan and a team of researchers at OHSU and UC San Diego received a $12.25 million NIH grant to develop film-like sensors that show brain activity in resolution that is 100 times higher than what is currently available. A high resolution improves a surgeon's ability to conduct surgery with greater precision. The OHSU team brought their expertise with awake brain surgery to the project. In epilepsy surgery, the goal is to remove as much of a tumor or lesion without damaging nearby tissue. Using this new technology, Raslan has identified epileptic brain activity never seen before. The sensors will likely have uses far beyond epilepsy, opening up new understandings of the brain and how it functions. A recording of this lecture is not available. [2021: Brain Awareness Lecture Series](#accordion-492541-2) May 5, 2021 | 12 noon PT | Zebrafish and the Secret to Brain Development Kelly Monk, Ph.D., Co-director and Professor, OHSU Vollum Institute In celebration of [Research Week](https://www.ohsu.edu/research-week), OHSU is proud to share the ground-breaking research of Professor Kelly Monk, Ph.D. Zebrafish, a popular aquarium fish, can reveal the inner workings of the nervous system, according to exciting research from OHSU Professor Kelly Monk, Ph.D. Dr. Monk will share insights on her team's recent discoveries and how they are opening up opportunities to learn more about brain biology and neurological disease. With their transparent bodies, zebrafish larvae provide a unique opportunity to see a living nervous system in action including all the different cell types that make up a functional brain. Although historically, studies of the nervous system have focused on neurons, neurons only represent about half of the brain. Dr. Monk and her team study the other half - a diverse group of cells called glia. Using sophisticated tools, Dr. Monk's team is able to capture the birth and behaviors of several different glia in the brain including how they interact with each other and with neurons. Taking advantage of the fact that zebrafish live in water, Dr. Monk and her team are also able to perform large-scale chemical screens to find drugs that impact nervous system development and health. Understanding the role glia play in the brain will be key to understanding devastating neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathies, Alzheimer's, and autism.

Come hear about intriguing new scientific data on mindfulness and brain stimulation in addiction recovery. Lifestyle Tweaks for Teen Psychosis Lynne Shinto, N.D., M.P.H., Professor of Neurology, Oregon Health & Science University For teens with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the medication they need can also lead to an inactive lifestyle, with potentially negative long-term health effects. Can simple activities like yoga, meditation and cooking meals offset medication side effects and reduce psychotic symptoms? Magic Mushrooms: Easing Depression and Anxiety at End of Life Anthony Bossis, Ph.D., Clinical Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry, New York University Could the ancient practice of using psychedelic compounds for insight and healing have a legitimate and safe role in today's health care? For many people, receiving a fatal diagnosis leads to psychological suffering, including anxiety and depression. Discover the intriguing implications of psilocybin-facilitated experiences in offering a sense of connection, meaning and transcendence at the end of life. [2018: Nourishing Your Neurons](#accordion-492541-5) Trade Food for Thought to Power 86 Million Neurons If an elephant has such a large brain, why aren't they smarter than primates? What biologic discovery led some primates to an evolutionary crossroads of cognitive capability? Suzana Herculano-Houzel, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Psychology and Biological Science, Vanderbilt Brain Institute, Vanderbilt, will explain why you may be surprised by the answer. No presentation is available to view. The \"Secret Sauce\" to Honing the Mind Executive function skills - self-control, perseverance, creativity - are more predictive of success than IQ. What supports and what hinders these skills? Adele Diamond, Ph.D, Canada Research Chair Tier 1 Professor of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, University of British Columbia, will discuss the benefits of play and movement. Anxiety and Learning Problems: Could it be the Fats You Eat? As essential nutrient our brains need for developing and maintaining our mental muscle and moods has been systematically removed from the modern diet - for convenience and \"health food.\" Without it, we can't think, focus or control ourselves as well. Bita Moghaddam, Ph.D., Ruth Matarazzo Professor and Chair, Department of Behavioral Neuroscience, OHSU, shows how food matters in youth and age. No presentation is available to view. [2017: The Secret Life of the Brain](#accordion-492541-6) [The Criminal Brain](https://echo360.org/media/d3ea9320-ebd2-4763-84da-77e16a2c8d00/public) Why do some people live lawful lives, while others gravitate toward repeated criminality? Do people choose to be moral or immoral, or is morality simply a genetically inherited function of the brain, like mathematical ability? Research suggests certain regions of the brain influence moral reasoning. Dr. Octavio Choi will explore how emerging neuroscience challenges long-held assumptions underlying the basis\u2014and punishment\u2014of criminal behavior. [Touch: The Science of Hand, Heart and Mind](https://echo360.org/media/4e9f6728-fb46-445f-b31a-dc054ed75ac3/public) Dual-function receptors in our skin make mint cool and chili peppers hot. Without the brain's dedicated centers for pleasure and emotional touch, an orgasm would feel more like a sneeze\u2014convulsive, but not especially nice. Dr. David Linden, New York Times-best-selling author of The Compass of Pleasure, delves into how the organization of our body's touch circuits is a complex and often counterintuitive system that affects everything from social interactions to general health and development. [Sleep, Memory and Dreams: Putting It All Together](https://echo360.org/media/25aa0dfc-3bac-4ffd-a285-28cb68be8cd4/public) It's no secret that without a good night's sleep we feel mentally sluggish. But what does our brain do while we sleep? Is there a scientific reason we dream? Dr. Robert Stickgold will explore why dreaming and sleep are key to retaining, strengthening and processing new memories and skills. [2016: Healthy Pleasures, Unhealthy Habits](#accordion-492541-7) [Alcohol and the brain (YouTube)](http://acmail.ohsu.edu/lt.php?c=12601&m=16470&nl=154&s=4caf2600c8a78e037ef947146102a25b&lid=204102&l=-https--youtu.be/KvNDTr_1Epc) The positive health benefits of red wine have been popular news headlines for many years. In moderation, alcohol has been seen to improve cardiovascular health, immune system response, and even prevent gallstones. On the other hand, the negative health and social impacts of alcoholism are apparent in just as much news coverage. Dr. Kathleen Grant explores how behavioral neuroscience informs how, why, and when the risks of alcohol may outweigh the benefits. [Gaming and the brain (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waRPyfNwr7o) The generation just coming of age has been exposed to more electronic technology than any one prior to it. Video games in particular have drawn scrutiny as influencing the obesity epidemic, attention deficits, and pronounced violence of our youth. They also show promise as educational tools, memory enhancers, and improving high-level thinking. Dr. Adam Gazzaley presents the science behind your brain on games. [Marijuana and the brain (Youtube)](http://acmail.ohsu.edu/lt.php?c=12601&m=16470&nl=154&s=4caf2600c8a78e037ef947146102a25b&lid=204104&l=-https--youtu.be/sMjdw-s25g0) Oregon recently joined only three other states to legalize recreational marijuana. As consumption of the plant's products becomes more a mainstream activity, its health benefits and risks will be at the forefront of policy discussions. Dr. Nephi Stella explains the role marijuana plays in cutting edge neuroscience research. [2015: The Infinite Brain](#accordion-492541-8) The quest for consciousness What is consciousness? What is hiding in our unconscious mind? And how can you harness both for a more fulfilling life? Consciousness is like an orchestra, and our brain is its conductor. Stemming in part from a long-standing collaboration with the late Nobel Laureate Francis Crick, Christof Koch, Ph.D., will be exploring how the flickering of nerve cells in the brain leads to information processing and the unforgettable experiences that make us who we are. Alzheimer's disease is a world affair Alzheimer's tops the list as the most feared diagnosis \u2014 even more than cancer or heart disease. It's for good reason: One in three people will die with Alzheimer's or some form of dementia. But Nicolas Bazan, M.D., Ph.D. has created a message of exploration and hope: Although Alzheimer's silences the mind, science can help solve the puzzle of the disease. In addition to being a scientist, Dr. Bazan is also the executive producer of the movie Una Vida: A Fable of Music and the Mind, based on his book which has won several film festival awards. Touching a nerve: the self as brain Increasingly, philosophers have come to recognize that understanding how the brain works is also essential to understanding the mind. Patricia Churchland, B.Phil., a ground-breaking philosophical neuroscientist, author, educator and MacArthur Award winner will explore the impact of scientific developments on our understanding of consciousness, the self, free will, decision making, ethics, learning and religion. Breaking the brain: the impact of concussion at any age Robert Stern, Ph.D. During collision sports such as football, the developing brain is at particular risk. Nearly 10 percent of athletes in contact sports suffer from concussions: about 135,000 each year for athletes between the ages of five and 18. Concussion rates in the high school game are 78 percent higher than in college, and brain injuries such as concussion lead to structural changes. Concussion may be a risk factor for mood swings, behavioral problems, motor dysfunction and even Alzheimer's disease\u2014especially for football players who start very young. Robert Stern, Ph.D., one of the world's top researchers on the effects of trauma on the brain, will discuss concussion at all ages. Art and the learning brain At a critical time in public education, critics are scrutinizing all aspects of curriculum and teaching styles. As it turns out, arts integration actually improves memory, retention and creativity. Mariale Hardiman, Ed.D. has developed a rich exchange between teachers and neuroscientists. The results are showing in teacher and parent satisfaction, classroom atmosphere and student outcomes: Her Brain-Targeted Teaching Model is recognized as a national model for both arts programming and integration. [2014: Building Brain Bridges](#accordion-492541-9) The brain and concussion: What is the impact of traumatic brain injury on soldiers and society? While the General Peter Chiarelli, former U.S. Army General and chief executive officer of the non-profit One Mind for Research won't be able to present his lecture in person in Portland, he has prepared a video presentation for the Portland audience. And he has sent One Mind for Research's chief financial officer, Janet Carbary, to speak about their group's work to fund research to treat and cure traumatic brain injuries and other brain injuries and diseases. Congressman Blumenauer, the founder of the Congressional Neuroscience Caucus will be at the lecture and will speak to these issues. The brain and the heart: Does brain health equal heart health? Is there such a thing as brain food? What is lifestyle medicine? Brain and heart degeneration can be altered very profoundly, but it needs to happen earlier, before symptoms of decline appear. Learn the very latest on the best ways to improve brain and heart health, along with new research related to the brain/heart connection. Joe Quinn, M.D., and Kent Thornburg, Ph.D., lead a discussion. The brain and the adolescent mind: Why is it so special and vulnerable at the same time? Bonnie Nagel, Ph.D. Associate Professor, Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital; member, OHSU Brain Institute The brain and cancer: How does your brain affect cancer \u2014 and its future treatments?

Marcus Raichle, M.D. Professor of radiology, neurology, neurobiology and biomedical engineering Washington University in St. Louis Nature vs. nurture: A story of adoption, reunion, neuroscience and shock therapy Larry Sherman, Ph.D. Senior scientist, Oregon National Primate Research Center, OHSU Brain Institute; professor, OHSU Department of Cell and Developmental Biology; president, Oregon Chapter of the Society for Neuroscience, Portland, Oregon [2012 Brain Awareness Lectures](#accordion-492541-11) Alzheimer's and the brain: What can we do? Gary Small, M.D. Director, UCLA Center on Aging, Los Angeles Alzheimer's disease affects five million people in the U.S. It's true that we have no \"cure\" for the disease, but Dr. Small shows how genetics account for only part of the risk. Multiple, large-scale studies have found healthy lifestyle choices lower risk and may delay the onset of symptoms, sometimes for years. The only \"cure\" for Alzheimer's is prevention, and the Alzheimer's Prevention Program shows how to take control. Law, ethics, humanity and the brain: How do they get along? Henry Greely, J.D. Director, Stanford Law School Center for Law and Bioscience, Stanford Neuroscience increasingly allows us to explain, predict, and even control aspects of human behavior. The ethical issues that arise from these developments extend beyond the boundaries of conventional bioethics into philosophy of mind, psychology, theology, public policy and the law. In classrooms, courtrooms, offices and homes around the world, neuroscience is giving us powerful new tools for achieving our goals and prompting a new understanding of ourselves as social, moral and spiritual beings.= New understandings of the brain: Why do we need them and what do we do with them? Alan Leshner, Ph.D. Executive Director, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington, D.C. Advances in neuroscience are raising medical hopes for millions of people. Once futuristic ideas are now becoming reality and improving the lives of soldiers, accident victims and others. But with these benefits come critical social and ethical issues. Creativity and the brain: What is it, who has it and how do we achieve it? Jonah Lehrer Author, Imagine: How Creativity Works and Proust Was a Neuroscientist, Los Angeles Can we learn how to be more creative? As it turns out, we can, says Jonah Lehrer. Lehrer is the journalist whose writings on neuroscience\u2014for Wired, The New Yorker and The New York Times Magazine, among others\u2014become immediate flashpoints for discussion. In his new book, Imagine: How Creativity Works, Lehrer, the bestselling author, most recently of How We Decide, shows us that creativity is not some near-mystical trait that some people seem to possess, and which others try desperately to capture. We can\u2014all of us\u2014take practical steps to become more creative in everything we do. Addiction and the brain: What is the toll it can take on the brain and on society? Nora Volkow, M.D. Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Bethesda Addiction is both subtle and profound. It sneaks up on individuals and ruins families. Through neuroscience, we know more about addiction today than ever before. One of the country's leading experts on addiction, Dr. Nora Volkow, will explore how addiction starts, what it is and what can be done about it. She will present the most current findings on addiction which could ultimately lead to breakthroughs in preventing it. The brain on fire: Can inflammation cause diseases that destroy the brain? Story Landis, Ph.D. Director, National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda Inflammation is part of the body's natural immune response to tissue damage. However, chronic inflammation is associated with many diseases. Why does the brain \"turn on itself?\" What is neuroinflammation? In the brain, it's thought to play a role in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. By linking so many illnesses to inflammation, researchers are now rethinking their assumptions about what makes us sick and looking for ways to treat inflammation\u2014and perhaps avoid these outcomes. Much of the scientific work that is discovering the causes and potential treatments for such neuroinflammatory diseases is being done by The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). [2011 Brain Awareness Lectures](#accordion-492541-12) Window into the brain: a new approach to depression Helen Mayberg, M.D. Emory University Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a revolutionary technology\u2014electrodes implanted in the brain so that low-voltage electrical currents stimulate regions to counteract disease. This relatively new medical technique, already benefitting thousands of Parkinson's disease patients, may one day be employed to treat a wider range of diseases including: depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, dystonia, chronic pain and depression. From genes to brains: a new understanding of autism Daniel Geschwind, M.D., Ph.D. UCLA Autism is a tragic disease, for the patient and for the family. It is a poorly understood disorder. Nevertheless, the frequency among U.S. children is greater than that of pediatric cancers, diabetes and AIDS combined. Even more concerning: the prevalence of autism is increasing\u2014one of every 110 children is diagnosed with the disease. In recent years, few medical conditions of childhood have stoked deeper concern\u2014and ignited greater controversy. What is happening? Where does it come from? What can be done? Pain and the brain: perception and the pathways to relief Howard Fields, M.D., Ph.D. UCSF Pain is both a sensation and a motivation. Our expectations, mood and perspective on pain powerfully influence how much something actually hurts\u2014and the decisions we make every day. The relief of pain and production of pleasure are closely related functions in the brain. Both have strong influences upon and are influenced by learning. Most people think of pain as a result of physical injury or disease, but psychological factors also play a huge role in pain perception. Pain is intimately tied to brain functions that govern behavior and decision making, including expectation, attention and learning. Pain competes for our attention and reaches far into our psyches. Neuropathic pain is especially difficult to live with and to treat. It is the result of damage to the body's nervous system and can cause excruciating pain. The brain and the immune system: How the body can turn on itself and cause such problems as M.S., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke and other disorders Stephen Hauser, M.D. UCSF Sometimes our bodies turn on us. The immune system becomes our own worst enemy. This can especially happen with the brain and nervous system causing a neuro-inflammatory response that can lead to such diseases as MS, Alzheimer's, Stroke, and Parkinson's. Neuroinflammation is a new and rapidly expanding field that has revolutionized our understanding of chronic neurological diseases. This field has grown to encompass researchers with backgrounds in many diverse fields, including pathology, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, clinical medicine, and epidemiology. Important contributions to this field have come from work with populations, with patients, with postmortem tissues, with animal models, and with in vitro systems. [2010 Brain Awareness Lectures](#accordion-492541-13) How we decide: from brains to behavior Jonah Lehrer Author, \"How We Decide\" At times, man is faced with life or death decisions or forced to make choices that have lifelong impacts. But how exactly does the brain make decisions when faced with complex problems? Are our brains efficient and well equipped to make choices? At what age do we develop good decision making abilities and why are some of us better equipped to make tough choices? Does reason or emotion rule? Battling brain disorders: the critical importance of mental health advocacy for the individual and for society Congressman Patrick Kennedy, Rhode Island Congressman Earl Blumenauer, Oregon, filled in when Congressman Patrick Kennedy was not able to attend The mercurial mind: bipolar disorder and creativity Kay Redfield Jamison, Ph.D. Psychiatrist and author How can one survive if their brain is constantly riding an emotional rollercoaster? That is a question faced by those who suffer from bipolar disease, otherwise known as manic-depressive illness.This relatively common mental disorder can cause unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and even influence one's ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. It can also lead to unbridled exuberance and creativity. What does make the artistic temperament so unique and so volatile? The emotional brain: the mysterious underpinnings of emotional life Joseph LeDoux, Ph.D. Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science and Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology New York University We know our emotions by their intrusions (welcome or otherwise) into our conscious minds. Understanding emotion in the human brain is clearly an important quest, as most mental disorders are emotional disorders. Emotions become powerful motivators of future behaviors. Mental health is maintained by emotional hygiene and mental problems, and to a large extent reflect a breakdown of emotional order. The executive brain: the frontal lobes and the civilized mind Jordan Grafman, Ph.D. Chief of the Cognitive Neuroscience Section National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Can the characteristics of leadership be defined and mapped in the brain? Can we change our own brains to resemble those of outstanding leaders? Are there training programs for more \"leader-like' brains? Is there such a thing as \"executive intelligence\"?

Where are these memories stored in the mind and how can we hold on to them for so many years? Answering questions like these earned neuroscientist Dr. Eric Kandel the Nobel Prize. Hear how his memory research helped form the basis of modern neuroscience. You may also learn why you always forget where you left your car keys. The developing human brain Pat Levitt, Ph.D., Vanderbilt University Do our childhood experiences affect the development our brains? Is it possible to prevent depression or disability by addressing these problems early in life? Dr. Pat Levitt is an expert in diagnosing and disrupting abnormal brain development. As a parent, learn what you can do to spot early warning signs and attack brain disorders head on. 55 minutes Gender and the brain Larry Cahill, Ph.D. Men may be from Mars and women may be form Venus, but sometimes it feels like we're from different solar systems entirely. Dr. Larry Cahill is an expert on gender and the brain. His research has identified the many differences and similarities between the male and female brains and has resulted in some mind-boggling findings.

In this disaster, we all had to isolate. The central need for humans to connect with others for resilience became the biggest threat to physical safety. We have substantial data to support that the nature of this terrible reality particularly effected children at all stages of development in a variety of ways. This talk will consider the unique elements of the pandemic's effect on child development and health and the resulting challenges in the schools, and will share thoughts on strategies for educators trying to cope and support children and their families. [Ajit Jetmalani, M.D.](https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/ajit-jetmalani-md), is the director of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry and the Joseph Professor of Psychiatry in the OHSU School of Medicine. He brings a broad experience in treating children, adolescents and adults in outpatient, day treatment, group home, residential and hospital environments. For the past 15 years, he has consulted to the Oregon Health Authority and Department of Human Services implementing health policies and programs to improve care for youth and families in Oregon. For this conversation he will draw from his experience as a senior health advisor to OHA during the first year of the COVID pandemic. From evidence to action: How can we build systems to promote children's nutritional health with a focus on equity? The evidence is clear: access to healthy foods in childhood is an investment in long-term health. Despite this evidence, children and adolescents in the U.S. still do not have sufficient and consistent access to high-quality nutrition, specifically those in low-income situations and minoritized racial and ethnic populations. This talk will provide a brief overview of the evidence supporting the need to mitigate food insecurity in youth in relation to health, the steps needed to ensure equitable implementation of initiatives, and steps for the future including tangible ways teachers can support and benefit from these initiatives.
