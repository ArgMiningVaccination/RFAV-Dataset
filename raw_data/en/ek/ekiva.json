Vaccines for Children LearningObjectives Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention2Proper vaccine storage and handling has been an important factor in preventing and eradicating many common vaccine-preventable diseases. Yet, each year, storage and handling errors result in revaccination of many patients and significant financial loss due to wasted vaccine. Failure to store and handle vaccines properly can reduce vaccine potency, resulting in inadequate immune response in patients and poor protection against disease. Patients can lose confidence in vaccines and providers if they have to be revaccinated because the vaccines they have received may have beencompromised.This annual education requirement provides an overview of approved vaccine storage and handling best practices. For more detailed information, refer to the CDC's Vaccine Storage and HandlingToolkit. Introduction Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention3The vaccine cold chain is a temperature-controlled environment used to maintain and distribute vaccines in optimalcondition.The cold chain begins with the cold storage unit at the manufacturing plant, extends through the transport of vaccines to the distributor and delivery to and storage at the provider facility, and ends with the administration of vaccine to the patient. Appropriate storage and handling conditions must be maintained at every link in the coldchain. ColdChain Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention4Too much exposure to heat, cold, or light at any step in the cold chain can damage vaccines, resulting in loss of vaccine potency. Once lost, potency cannot be restored. Each time vaccinesare exposed to improper conditions, potency is reduced further. Eventually, if the cold chain is not properly maintained, potency will be lost completely, and vaccines will beuseless.While exposure to any inappropriate conditions can affect potency of refrigerated vaccines, a single exposure to freezing temperatures (0\u00b0C [32\u00b0F] or colder) will destroy some. Liquid vaccines that contain an adjuvant canpermanently lose potency when exposed to freezing temperatures. ColdChain Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention5Vaccine appearance in not a reliable indicator that vaccines have been stored in appropriate conditions. For example, inactivated vaccines, even when exposed to freezing temperatures, may not appear frozen, giving no indication of reduced or lostpotency. The Rights of Medication Administration Adapted forVaccines Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention6Results of a cold chain failure can be costly. ACIP's General best practice Guidelines for Immunization state, \"Vaccine exposed to inappropriate temperatures that is inadvertently administered should generally be repeated.\" Inappropriate storage can mean extra doses for patients, increased costs for providers, and damage to public confidence in vaccines. More importantly, patients who refuse revaccination can remain unprotected from serious, vaccine-preventable diseases. By maintaining the vaccine cold chain, your facility can avoid incurring the additional costs associated with loss and replacement of vaccines, as well as the resources needed to recall patients forrevaccination.

Staff Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention10All staff members who receive deliveries and/or handle or administer vaccines should be familiar with storage and handling policies and procedures at their facility. Keep plans and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for storage and handling near storage units and make sure staff knows where to findthem. Staff Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention11CDC recommends that storage and handling training should be done:As part of new employeeorientationAnnually as a refresher for all staff involved in immunization and vaccine storage and handling activitiesWhenever new vaccines are added toinventoryWhenever recommendations for storage and handling of vaccines areupdated.IfyouareaVFCprovider,itisrequiredthatboththevaccinecoordinatorandbackupvaccinecoordinatorcompleteanannualstorageandhandlingtraining. Staff Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention12Designate a primary vaccine coordinator for your facility who will be responsible for ensuring all vaccines are stored and handled correctly. Appoint a second staff member to serve as an alternate in the absence of the primary coordinator (this is particularly important in case of after-hour emergencies). Both coordinators should be fully trained in routine and emergency policies andprocedures.

CDC recommends that storage and handling training should be done as part of new employee orientation, annually as a refresher for all staff involved in immunization and vaccine storage and handling activities, whenever new vaccines are added to inventory, and whenever recommendations for storage and handling of vaccines areupdated. KnowledgeCheck Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention16Think of your storage and monitoring equipment as an insurance policy to protect your patients from inadvertent administration of compromised vaccine, and your facility against costs of revaccination, replacement of expensive vaccines, and loss of patient confidence in your practice. For the best protection, your facility needs appropriate equipment that is set up correctly and maintained and repaired asneeded.Proper Vaccine StorageTemperaturesRefrigerated vaccines should be stored at temperatures between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F). The thermostat should be set at midrange to achieve a temperature of about 5\u00b0C (40\u00b0F), which will decrease the likelihood of temperatureexcursions.Vaccines stored in the freezer should maintain temperatures between -50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C(-58\u00b0F and 5\u00b0F). The thermostat should be at the factory-set or midpoint temperature setting to assure appropriate frozen storagetemperatures. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention17To fully ensure the safety of vaccines, the following equipment isrecommended:Stand-alone refrigerator(s) with enough space to accommodate your maximum inventory withoutcrowdingStand-alone freezer(s) with enough space to accommodate your maximum inventory withoutcrowdingDigital data logger (DDL) with a current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testingfor each unit and at least one backup in case of a broken or malfunctioningdevice Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention18Refrigerators and freezers typically used for vaccine storage are available in different grades (household and purpose-built) and types (stand-alone and combination refrigerator/freezer). In addition to traditional refrigeration units, there are also purpose-built auto-dispensing units withoutdoors.Purpose-built units are sometimes referred to as \"pharmaceutical grade\" and are designed specifically for storage ofbiologics.These units oftenhave:Microprocessor-based temperature control with a digital temperature sensor (thermocouple, resistance temperature detector [RTD], or thermistor)Fan-forced air circulation, with powerful fans or multiple cool air vents inside the unit that promote uniform temperature and fast temperaturerecovery Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention19CDC make the following recommendations for vaccine storageunits:Use purpose-built units designed to either refrigerateor freeze (can be compact, under-the-counter-style or large units).If a purpose-built unit is not available, use astand-alone householdunit.If you must use a household-grade combination refrigerator/freezer unit, only use the refrigerator compartment for storing vaccines. These units have cold spots and temperature fluctuations, and air circulating from the freezer could exposerefrigerated vaccines to freezing temperatures. Use a separate stand-alone freezer to store frozenvaccines. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention20Do not store any vaccine in a dormitory-style or bar-style combined refrigerator/freezer unit under any circumstances. These units have a single exterior door and an evaporator plate/cooling coil, usually located in an icemaker/freezer compartment. These units have been shown to pose a significant risk of freezing vaccines, even when used for temporarystorage.Not all small storage units are dormitory-or bar-style units. Compact purpose-built units for biologics can be used to storevaccines. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention21Make sure the storage unit has enough space to store the largest inventory you might have at the busiest point in the year (e.g., flu season) withoutcrowding.Remove any deli, fruit, and vegetable drawers from refrigerator units. This provides extra space for water bottles to help maintain stable temperature and prevents use of the drawers for storing food, beverages, orvaccines.Use safeguards to ensure the doors of the unit remain closed (for example, self-closing door hinges, door alarms, door locks,etc.).Keep in mind that it may take 2 to 7 days to stabilize the temperature in a newly installed or repaired refrigerator or 2 to 3 days for a freezer. Before using a unit to store vaccines, check and record the minimum and maximum temperatures each workday for 2 to 7 days. In addition, check and record temperatures a minimum of 2 times each workday. Once you have 5 consecutive days of temperatures recorded within the recommended range, your unit is stable and ready to beused. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention22Determine the correctanswer.You need to store a vaccine that requires freezer temperatures between -50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C(-58\u00b0F and 5\u00b0F). Which type of storage unit would be acceptable for storing thesevaccines?Freezer compartment of a combination refrigerator/freezer unit, as long as there is an external freezerdoorStand-alone freezerunitDormitory-style refrigerator with internal freezerareaA stand-alone freezer should be used for storing vaccines that require temperaturesbetween-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C (-58\u00b0F and 5\u00b0F). Best practice is to NOT use the freezer compartment of a combination refrigerator/freezer unit or a dormitory-style unit to store vaccines at anytime. KnowledgeCheck Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention23An accurate temperature history that reflects actual vaccine temperature is critical for protecting your vaccines. Every vaccine storage unit must have a temperature monitoring device, and investing in reliable devices is less expensive than replacing vaccines wasted due to inaccurate temperaturereadings. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention24CDC requires the use of a specific type of temperature monitoring device known as a digital data logger (DDL) for continuous temperature monitoring and recording. The DDL should be set to measure and record temperatures no less frequently than every 30 minutes and should have a current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing (also known as a Report of Calibration). Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention25Unlike a simple minimum/maximum thermometer, which only shows the coldest and warmest temperatures reached in a unit, DDLs provide detailed information on all temperatures recorded at presetintervals.Many DDLs use a buffered temperature probe, which is the most accurate way to measure actual vaccine temperatures. Temperatures measured by a buffered probe match vaccine temperatures more closely than those measured by standard thermometers, which tend instead to reflect air temperature. DDLs provide the most accurate storage unit temperature information, including details on how long a unit has been operating outside the recommended temperature range (referred to as a temperatureexcursion). Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention26Your facility should have a temperature monitoring device (DDL)for:Each vaccine storageunitEach emergency transport unit (this is particularly important if there are more transport units than storageunits)At least one backup temperature monitoring device in case a primary device malfunctions or is out for calibration testing (make sure the backup device has a different calibration testing schedule than the primary device so it is available when the primary device is being tested) Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention27CDC recommends DDLs with the followingfeatures:Detachable probe that best reflects vaccine temperatures (e.g., a probe buffered with glycol, glass beads, sand, orTeflon\u00ae)Alarm for out-of-rangetemperaturesLow-batteryindicatorCurrent, minimum, and maximum temperature displayRecommended uncertainty of +/-0.5\u00b0C (+/-1\u00b0F)Logging interval (or reading rate) that can be programmed by the user to measure and record temperature no less frequently than every 30minutes Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention28CDC recommends that a DDL's current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing (Report of Calibration) shouldinclude:Model/device name ornumberSerialnumberDate of calibration (report or issuedate)Confirmation that the instrument passed testing (or instrument intolerance)Recommended uncertainty of +/-0.5\u00b0C (+/-1\u00b0F) orless Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention29Certain types of temperature monitoring devices have significant limitations and should not be used to measure temperatures in a vaccine storage unit. These devices can be difficult to read and, because they only show the temperature at the exact time they are checked, may fail to detect temperatures outside the recommendedrange. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention30Specifically, CDC does not recommend the following temperature monitoringdevices:Alcohol or mercury thermometers, even if placed in a fluid-filled biosafe liquidvialBi-metal stem temperature monitoringdevicesFood temperature monitoringdevicesChartrecordersInfrared temperature monitoringdevicesTemperature monitoring devices that do not have a current and valid Certificate of CalibrationTestingDevices sold in hardware and appliance stores are generally designed to monitor temperature for household food storage. They are not calibrated and not accurate enough to ensurevaccines are stored within the correct temperature range. Using these devices can pose a significant risk of damaging expensivevaccines. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention31Determine the correctanswer.Which temperature monitoring device is recommended by CDC for use in a vaccine storage unit?Alcohol or mercury thermometers, even if placed in a fluid-filled biosafe liquidvialInfrared temperature monitoringdeviceChartrecorderDDL with detachable probe that best reflects vaccinetemperaturesThe DDL should have an alarm for out-of-range temperatures and a low-battery indicator.The DDL should have an indicator for current, minimum, and maximum temperatures and a logging interval that can be programmed by the user to measure and record temperatures no less frequently than every 30minutes. KnowledgeCheck Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention32Good air circulation around the outside of the storage unit isimportant.Place storage units in a well-ventilated room, leaving space between the unit, ceiling, and anywall.Nothing should block the cover of the motorcompartment.The unit should be firm and level, with the bottom of the unit above thefloor.Make sure the unit door opens and closes smoothly and fits squarely against the body of theunit.Studies find that most units work best when placed in an area with standard indoor room temperatures, usually considered to be between 20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F and 77\u00b0F).Check the manufacturer-supplied owner's manual for additional guidance on placement and spacing. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention33Take the following precautions to protect the storage unit's powersupply:Plug in only one storage unit per electrical outlet toavoid creating a fire hazard or triggering a safety switch that would turn off power.Use a safety-lock plug or an outlet cover to preventthe unit from beingunplugged.Post \"DO NOT UNPLUG\" warning signs at outlets and on storage.Label fuses and circuit breakers to alert people not toturn off power to storage units. Labels should include immediate steps to take if power is interrupted. If your building is owned by a third party and you do not have access to the circuit breakers, work with your building manager. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention34Avoid using power outlets that can be trippedor switched off, including:Built-in circuit switches (may have resetbuttons)Outlets that can be activated by a wallswitchMulti-outlet powerstripsIf the entire storage unit is impacted by a temperature excursion because of a power outage or unit malfunction, refer to your facility's emergency storage and handlingSOPs.

KnowledgeCheck Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention36Following recommended guidelines and best practices for placement of vaccines in a storage unit will help to prevent conditions that could reduce vaccine potency or cause vaccinefailure.Always refer to manufacturers' product information/package inserts for the mostup-to-date storage and handling recommendations for specific vaccines anddiluents. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention37Refrigerated vaccines should be stored between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F), with a desired 5\u00b0C (40\u00b0F). Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine may be stored in eithera refrigerator or a freezer. Some diluents must be refrigerated, while others may be stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature (no warmer than 25\u00b0C [77\u00b0F]). Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention38Best practices for storing vaccine and diluent in a refrigeratedunit include:Always store vaccines in their original packaging with lids closed unit ready for administration. This protects them from light and provides additional thermal protection/stability. Never store loose vials or manufacturer-filled syringes outside of their packaging. This increases the risk of administration errors, exposes vaccine to light, and makes it more difficult to track expiration dates and manageinventory.Place water bottles on the top shelf and floor and in the door racks. Putting water bottles in the unit can help maintain stable temperatures caused by frequently opening and closing unit doors or a power failure. It can also prevent vaccines from being stored in areas where there is a greater risk of out-of-range temperatures (such as the top shelf, floor, and door). Place water bottles carefully so they cannot dislodge, preventing the door from closing securely or weighing the door down so the sealsare not tight. Label all water bottles, \"DO NOTDRINK.\" Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention39Best practices for storing vaccine and diluent in a refrigerated unit(continued):Whenever possible, store diluent with the corresponding refrigeratedvaccine.Store each type of vaccine or diluent in a separatecontainer.Attach labels to shelves and containers to clearly identify where each type of vaccine and diluent isstored.Storevaccinesanddiluentswithsimilarpackagingornamesorwithbothpediatricandadultformulationsondifferentshelves.Makesuetolabeltheformulation\"pediatric\"or\"adult\",ifapplicable.Place vaccines and diluents in the center of the unit, 2 to 3 inches away from walls, ceiling, floor, and door.

Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention40Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention41Best practices for storing vaccine and diluent in a refrigerated unit(continued):Do not store vaccines in deli, fruit, or vegetable drawers, or in the door. Temperatures in these areas are not stable and can differ from those inside the main part of theunit.Arrange vaccines and diluents in rows, allowing space between rows to promote air circulation. This helps each vaccine and diluent maintain a consistenttemperature.Place vaccines and diluents with the earliest expiration dates in front of those with later expirationdates.Do not pack a storage unit too tightly. This can restrict circulation and impact vaccine temperature. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention42Freezers should maintain temperatures between -50\u00b0Cand-15\u00b0C (-58\u00b0F and 5\u00b0F).

Never store loose vials or manufacturer-filled syringes outside of their packaging.Place water bottles against the walls, in the back, on the floor, and in the door racks. Place water bottles carefully so they cannot dislodge, preventing the door from closing securely or weighing the door down so the seals are not tight. Label all water bottles, \"DO NOT DRINK.\" Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention44Best practices for storing vaccine in a freezer unit(continued):Store each type of vaccine in a separatecontainer.Attach labels to shelves and containers to clearly identify where each type of vaccineis stored.Store vaccines with similar packaging or names or with both pediatric and adult formulations on different shelves. Make sure to label the formulation \"pediatric\" or \"adult\", ifapplicable.Place vaccines in the center of the unit, 2 to 3 inches away from walls, ceiling, floor, and door. Avoid storing vaccines in any part of the unit that may not provide stable temperatures or sufficient air flow, such as directly under cooling vents or shelves on the door.Arrange vaccines in rows, allowing space between rows to promote aircirculation.Place vaccines with the earliest expiration dates infront.Do not pack a storage unit too tightly. This can restrict air circulation and impact vaccine temperature. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention45If possible, no items other than vaccines, diluents, and water bottles should be placed or stored in theunits.Food and beverage should never be stored in the unit with vaccines. Doing so can lead to frequent opening of the doorto access food, putting vaccines at risk of temperature fluctuations and excessive light exposure. It can also result in spills andcontamination.If other medications and biological products must be stored in the same unit as vaccines, never store these products in the same container with vaccines. Always store them below vaccines and on a different shelf. This prevents contamination and reduces the likelihood of medicationerrors. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention46Determine the correctanswer.The temperature inside the freezer unit used to vaccines (0\u00b0F) and 15\u00b0F)The freezer temperature for vaccine storage must be between -50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C (-58\u00b0Fand5\u00b0F). This helps ensure optimal conditions for maintaining the potency of vaccines that require storage in thefreezer.

Each vaccine also needs to be stored separately to avoid confusion ormistakes. KnowledgeCheck Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention50It is important to follow recommended best practices for placement of a temperature monitoring device to ensure that the device reflects the temperature of thevaccines.If using a digital data logger (DDL) in a storageunit:Place the buffered probe of the DDL in the center of the unit with the vaccines surrounding it. A device placed near the walls, floor, vent, ceiling, or door may indicate temperatures that are colder or warmer than the actual vaccinetemperature. This may not be true for pharmaceutical units because air flow and temperature are better regulated. Refer to your owner's manual for instructions on temperature monitoring deviceplacement.Place the DDL's active digital display outside the unit so temperatures can be read without opening the door and disturbing the prove. CDC recommends that DDLs be set to measure and record temperatures no less frequently than every 30minutes. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention51CDC recommends that provider who are using a DDLshould:Check and record storage unit minimum and maximum temperatures at the start of each workday. This is a requirement for VFC providers. The min/max temperatures recorded should be those obtained since the last workday when the min/max temperatures were reset. This should be done even if there is a temperature alarm. A temperature monitoring log sheet should be placed on each storage unit door (or nearby), and the following information should berecorded:-Min/maxtemperatures-Date-Time-Name or initials of person who checked and recorded thetemperatures-Any actions taken if a temperature excursionoccurredThe current temperature should be check and recorded a minimum of 2 times during workday (at the start and end of theworkday).Also check the current temperature each time vaccines are accessed in the storage unit. If a reading is missed, leave a blank entry in thelog.These checks provide an opportunity to inspect the storage unit, reorganize any misplaced vaccines, and remove any expiredvaccines. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention52CDC recommends on a weekly basis:Review storage unit temperature readings and review continuous DDL software or website information for changes in temperature trends that might require action (adjusting unit temperature or repairing/replacing storage or temperature monitoringequipment).Filethisinformationsoitanbeanalyzedforlong-termtrendsand/orrecurringproblems.Temperaturedatashouldbekeptfor3years(unlessstatestatutesorrulesrequirealongerperiod).If there appears to be any fluctuation in temperature, troubleshoot the problem based on additional information provided in CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit, manufacturer manuals, and/or your storage and handlingSOPs. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention53Temperature excursions or inappropriate conditions for any vaccine require immediate action. Any temperature reading outside ranges recommended in the manufacturers' package inserts is considered a temperatureexcursion.In general, manufacturers analyze information about the magnitude of the temperature excursion and the total amount of time that temperatures were out of range, as well as information about the vaccine in question, to determine whether a vaccine is likely to still be viable. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention54If there is any question about whether vaccines may have been exposed to a temperature excursion because the unit became too cold or too hot, CDC recommends the followingsteps:1.Any staff member who hears an alarm or notices a temperature excursion on the DDL should notify the primary or alternate vaccine coordinator immediately or report theproblem to theirsupervisor.2.Label exposed vaccines \"DO NOT USE\" and isolate them from other vaccines in thestorage unit (do not discard thesevaccines). Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention553. The vaccine coordinator, supervisor, or if necessary, the person reporting the problem should begin to document the event with the followinginformation:Date and time of the temperatureexcursionStorage unit temperature and room temperature, if available (including minimum/maximum temperatures during the time of the event, ifavailable)Name of the person completing thereportDescription of the event, including: a general description of what happened, the length of time vaccine may have been affected (if using a DDL), an inventory of affected vaccines, items in the unit (including water bottles) other than vaccines, any problems with the storage unit and/or affected vaccines before the event, and other relevantinformation4. Implement your facility SOPs to adjust unit temperature to the appropriate range. At a minimum, check the temperature monitoring device to make sure it is appropriately placed in the center of thevaccines. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention565.Contact the vaccine manufacturer(s) for further guidance on whether to use affected vaccines and for information about whether patients will need to be recalled for revaccination.

A door that is not sealed properly or that is left open unnecessarily not only affects the temperatures in a unit, it also exposes vaccines to light, which can reduce potency of some vaccines. Leaving the door open can cause the thermostat to respond to warmer room temperatures, and the unit will work harder to maintain the correct temperature inside. The unit will continue to adjust its output of cool air, and the temperature may become very cold in some parts of the unit, possibly freezing refrigerated vaccine. Using an open-door alarm and a self-closing door may behelpful.If your facility has a backup generator, it should be tested quarterly and serviced annually (check the manufacturer's guidance for testing procedures and maintenanceschedules). Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention64Because all temperature monitoring devices experience \"drift\" over time that affects their accuracy, calibration testing should be done every 1 to 2 years or according to the manufacturer's suggestedtimeline.If calibration testing indicates your temperature monitoring device is no longer accuratewithin+/-0.5\u00b0C (+/-1\u00b0F), it should be replaced. Adjustments to correct accuracy of the device arenot recommended. You may prefer to replace the device rather than submitting it for calibration testing. Any new temperature data logger must have a current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing (also known as Report ofCalibration). Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention65Is the statement below true orfalse?Calibrated temperature monitoring devices require periodic calibration testing to ensure accuracy.TRUE FALSEBecause all temperature monitoring devices experience \"drift\" over time that affects their accuracy, calibration testing should be done every 1 to 2 years or according to the manufacturer's suggestedtimeline. KnowledgeCheck Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention66Storage unit temperatures will likely need to be adjusted over time. In some situations, thermostats may need to be reset in summer and winter, depending on roomtemperature.Thermostat adjustments should only be made by the primary or alternate vaccine coordinator, based on temperature monitoring devices and temperature monitoringlogs.Post a warning sign on all storage units stating, \"Do NOT adjust temperature controls. Notify (name of vaccine coordinator) if adjustments arenecessary.\"Temperature adjustments should not be done during a busy clinic day when the unit door is being frequently opened andclosed. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention67Remember that temperatures within any storage unit will vary at least slightly, even with normal use. Therefore, before makingadjustment:Confirm the unit is securely plugged into a powersource.Check the temperature inside the storageunit.Wait 30 minutes, without opening the door, and check it again. Use your backup device if you think there might be a problem with your monitoringdevice.If you confirm that an adjustment isneeded:Refer to the owner's manual for detailedinstructions.Turn the thermostat knob slowly to avoid going outside the correct temperature range, and make a small adjustment asnecessary.Allow the temperature inside the unit to stabilize for 30 minutes without opening thedoor.Recheck thetemperature.Repeat these steps asneeded.Consider placing additional water bottles in the unit to help improve temperaturestability.Please note: with a combination storage unit, adjustments to the freezer temperature can adversely affect the refrigerator compartment temperature, possibly resulting in frozen refrigeratedvaccines. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention68Do not leave vaccines in a storage unit that does not maintain temperature within the recommendedrange.If you are unable to stabilize the temperature in your unit within the required range, or temperatures in the unit are consistently at the extreme high or low end of the range, your vaccine supply is at high risk. Use your emergency storage and handling plan and SOPs to identify an alternative unit with appropriate temperatures and sufficient storage space until the primary unit can be repaired orreplaced. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention69If the temperature alarm goes off repeatedly, do not disconnect the alarm until you have determined and addressed thecause.Do basic checks of the unit door, power supply, and thermostatsetting.If the alarm continues to trigger or the temperature remains out of range, transfer vaccines to a backup unit as directed by your emergency storage and handling plan andSOPs.Have a repair technician check your equipment to determine the need for repairor replacement. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention70Mishandling a temperature monitoring device can affect its accuracy. If a temperature monitoring device is dropped, hit against the side of a storage unit, or potentially damaged in any other way, its accuracy should be checked against another calibrated temperature monitoring device. If there is any question about accuracy, the device should be sent for calibration testing orreplaced.It is common with some devices to see a slight variation in temperature from one reading to another, even when the unit thermostat is set at a particular temperature. Temperatures within any storage unit will vary at least slightly, even with normal use. If you observe no fluctuation in your temperature monitoring device, the device may be faulty and may need calibration testing orreplacement. Storage and Temperature MonitoringEquipment Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention71Vaccines are expensive, so it's important to make sure they are unpacked and stored correctly, and to account for every dose received and used by your facility, whether administered, wasted, compromised, expired, or transferred. Keeping accurate records to assist you in ordering and rotating stock on a regular basis will ensure that your facility has available the vaccines your patientsneed. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention72All staff members who might receive vaccine deliveries must be aware of the importance of maintaining the cold chain. They should be trained to immediately notify the vaccine coordinator or alternate when deliveries arrive so that vaccines are checked in and stored quickly.The person arranging for deliveries should know which staff member will be available to receive them, considering holidays, vacations, and any changes in the facility's hours of operation. Ideally, the vaccine coordinator or alternate should be available to receivedeliveries.Never leave a vaccine shipping container unpacked or unattended. If vaccines and diluents inside get too warm, they cannot be used. Be sure all staff members know that vaccine deliveries require immediateattention. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention73Vaccines and diluents must be carefully unpacked, stored at recommended temperature, and documented immediately after they arrive. Do not place an unopened and/or unpacked shipment box in a vaccine storageunit.When unpackingdeliveries:Examine the shipping container and vaccines for signs of physicaldamage.Check the contents against the packing list to be sure theymatch.If the shipment includes lyophilized (freeze-dried) vaccines, make sure they came with the correct type and quantity ofdiluents.Check both the vaccine and diluent expiration dates to ensure you have not receivedany expired or soon-to-expireproducts.Check the cold chain monitor (CCM) for any indication of a temperature excursion during transit.If there are any discrepancies between the contents and the packing list or other concernsabout the contents, immediately notify the vaccinemanufacturer. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention74Understanding expiration dates is a key component of managing your vaccine inventory. Vaccine and diluent expiration dates indicate when the product must be discarded if it has not been used. These dates are printed on vials, manufacturer-filled syringes, andpackages.When the expiration date has only a month and year, the product may be used up to and including the last day of that month. If a day is included with the month and year, the product may only be used through the end of thatday. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention75Be aware of instances when vaccines expire before the expiration date on thelabel.Sometimes vaccines must be used before the expiration date, by an earlier date known as the \"beyond use date\" (BUD). The BUD is calculated based on the date the vial is first entered and the storage information in the package insert. The BUD replaces the expiration date and should be noted on the label along with the initials of the person making thechange.Examplesinclude:Reconstituted vaccines have a limited time frame for use once the vaccine is mixed with a diluent. This time frame or BUD is noted in the package insert. For example, if the package insert states that the reconstitution vaccine must be used within 30 minutes, it must be discarded if not used by thattime.Multidose vials might have a specified time frame for use once they have been entered with a needle. For example, the package insert may state that the vaccine must be discarded 28 days after it isentered.Manufacturer-shortened expiration dates may apply when vaccine is exposed to inappropriate storage conditions. The manufacturer might determine that the vaccine can still be used, but will expire on an earlier date than the date on thelabel. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention76Determine the correctanswer.Today is 10/19 and the date on the single-dose vaccine vial you are about to give is also 10/19 of the current year. Can this vial of vaccine beused?YESNOVaccines can be used until the end of the expiration date listed. This vaccine can be used today, but would be invalid if used tomorrow(10/20). KnowledgeCheck Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention77A stock record helps you keep track of your vaccine inventory. These records can be inpaper or electronic form, or part of an immunization information system (IIS) with the capacity to manage vaccine inventory. The stock record should be updatedweekly.You should account for and document every dose of vaccine on a stock record,including:Date of delivery (and initials of the person who unpacked thedelivery)Vaccine and diluent name andmanufacturerNumber and expiration date for each lot (including expiration dates based on beyond use date guidance in the productinformation)Number of dosesreceivedCondition of each vaccine and diluent uponarrivalCold chain monitor (CCM) reading if CCM is included in the shippingcontainerNumber of doses used (i.e., administered, wasted, expired ortransferred)Balance of remaining doses after subtracting the amountused Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention78If you receive multiple doses of the same vaccine in the same presentation from the same lot with the same expiration date, you can document these doses as one entry on the stock record. Indicate the total number of doses received, regardless of how many vials or syringes the doses came in. For example, if you receive 10 single-dose vials of the same vaccine with the same lot number and expiration date, you can make a single entry on the stock record, noting that 10 doses werereceived.Doses of diluents that come with lyophilized (freeze-dried) vaccines should be documented on a separate stock record. Quantities of vaccines and their corresponding diluents should be equal at alltimes. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention79Use tally sheets to help you keep your stock record up to date. Place tally sheets outside the storage unit door (or another easily accessible location), and have staff use tick marks to keep a count of every dose removed from the unit (with columns for those administered, wasted, compromised, expired, ortransferred).At least weekly, add up the dose counts on the tally sheet and transfer that information to the stockrecord. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention80Vaccine stock should be rotated and checked for expired dosesregularly.The vaccine coordinator (or other designated person) should rotate vaccine and diluent stock at least once a week, as well as each time your facility receives a vaccine deliver. Arrange stock in the storage unit so that for each vaccine type, doses with the earliest expiration dates are placed in front of those with later expirationdates.Check expiration dates on vaccines and diluents at least once a week, and immediately remove any expired vaccines and diluents to avoid inadvertently administeringthem.Be sure to document expired doses on the tally sheet and stock record. Maine Immunization Program expired vaccine must be reconciled out of inventory and returned using a return authorization form that can be obtained by calling theprogram. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention81The information in your stock record will help you determine the type and amount of vaccine your facility should stock to meet the needs of your patients. Make sure you are only ordering the vaccines and presentations that are appropriate for the ages and types of patients your facilityserves.CDC recommends provider should order and stock only enough vaccine to meet patient needs. Storing a larger volume than your facility needs can increase the risk of wasting vaccines if they expire before they can be used or they are compromised in someway.Most facilities should also reorder based on patient needs after doing a stock count. Vaccine orders usually arrive within 1 to 2 weeks, but keep in mind there could be delays. If possible, avoid placing a last-minute or rush orders to prevent the risk of running out ofvaccines. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention82Medical waste disposal requirements are set by state environmentalagencies.General disposal guidelinesfor:Vaccine doses that have expired or been compromised -contact the Maine Immunization Program.

Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention83\"Transport\" has a different meaning than \"shipping\" which usually involves a professional carrier and a longer distance and time period for moving vaccines between locations. Transport involves the movement of vaccine over a short time frame and distance between providers. The time needed to transport should be fewer than 8 hours and vaccine should be placed in a stable storage unit as quickly aspossible.CDC does not recommend any shipment of vaccines from your vaccine supply or any routine transport ofvaccines.Vaccines should only be transported when absolutely necessary (e.g., for a mass immunization clinic, in an emergency, or to ensure vaccines that are about to expire can be used rather than wasted). Frozen vaccines should never be transported except in anemergency.CDC does not recommend reshipping vaccines after receiving them from a commercial distributor or manufacturer because doing so would put the cold chain, and ultimately, the viability of the vaccines, atrisk. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention84Vaccine that will be used at an off-site or satellite facility should be delivered directly to that facility. If that is not possible, vaccines should be transported using a portable vaccine refrigerator with a temperature monitoring device. If this is not available, qualified containers and pack-outs can be used with a temperature monitoringdevice.If you must transportvaccines:Transport only what is needed for theworkday.The total time for transport and workday should be a maximum of 8hours.If you must transport vaccines in non-commercial vehicles, use the passenger compartment -not the trunk.Immediately upon arrival at an off-site/satellite facility, vaccines should be stored in an appropriate storage unit with a temperature monitoring device. If the device displays min/max temperatures, they should be checked and recorded. If the device does not display min/max temperatures, then the current temperature should be checked and recorded a minimum of 2 times (at the start and end of theworkday).If vaccines cannot be stored in an on-site storage unit, they should be kept in the portable vaccine refrigerator during an off-siteclinic:Place a temperature monitoring device (preferably with a probe in a thermal buffer) as close as possible to the vaccines, and read and record temperatures at leasthourly.Keep the container closed as much aspossible.Remove only 1 multidose vial or 10 doses at a time for preparation and administration by each person administeringvaccines. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention85Transport diluents with their corresponding vaccines to ensure there are always equal amounts of vaccine and diluents for reconstitution.

There have been outbreaks of infections caused by pooling contents and/or storing contents for futureuse.Do not open an SDV until ready to use. Before you remove the protective cap, always check the vial to make sure you have the correct vaccine. Once you remove the cap, you must use the vaccine because it may not be possible to determine if the rubber seal has been punctured. Discard any unused SDVs without a protective cap at the end of theworkday. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention88A multidose vial (MDV) contains more than one dose of vaccine. Because MDVs typically contain a preservative to help prevent the growth of microorganisms, they can be entered or punctured more than once. Only the number of doses indicted in the manufacturer's package insert should be withdrawn from the vial. After the maximum number of doses has been withdrawn, the vial should be discarded, even if there is residual and the expiration date has not beenreached.MDVs can be used until the expiration date printed on the vial unless the vaccine is contaminated or compromised in some way or there is a beyond use date (BUD) noted in the packageinsert.Never use partial doses from two or more vials to obtain a dose ofvaccine. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention89A manufacturer-filled syringe (MFS) is prepared and sealed under sterile conditions bythe manufacturer.Do not active an MFS (i.e., remove the syringe cap or attach the needle) until ready to use.

Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention90Lyophilized (freeze-dried) vaccine may be in the form of a powder or pellet that must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) in a process known as \"reconstitution\" before beingadministered.Diluents are not interchangeable unless specified by themanufacturer:Only use the diluent supplied with the vaccine to reconstituteit.Never use a stock vial of sterile water or normal saline to reconstitutevaccines.Liquid diluents vary in volume and composition and are specifically designed to meet the requirements of their correspondingvaccine.Some diluents contain antigen or an adjuvant (refer to manufacturer's package insert for guidance on storage and handling).Never administer vaccine reconstituted with the wrong diluent. If the vaccine has already been administered, contact your immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer guidance onrevaccination.Always check expiration dates on both diluents and vaccines before reconstitutingthem. Inventory Management, Transport, andPreparation Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention91CDC recommends drawing up vaccines only at the time of administration. Once vaccines are inside syringes, it is difficult to tell them apart, which can lead to administrationerrors.Predrawing can also result in vaccine waste if more is drawn up than isneeded.General-use syringes are designed for immediate administration -not for storage. Contamination and growth of microorganisms can occur in syringes with predrawn vaccine that does not contain a preservative. In addition, vaccine components may interact with polymers in a plastic syringe over time, potentially reducing vaccinepotency.Vaccine manufacturers do not recommend predrawing vaccines in advance of influenza vaccination clinics because no data exists on the stability of vaccines stored in general-use syringes that been filled byproviders.As an alternative to predrawing vaccines, CDC recommends using manufacturer-filled syringes for large immunizationclinics.

EmergencyPreparations Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention99An on-site generator can prevent having to transport vaccine to an alternative storage facility during a power outage. Keep sufficient fuel on hand to continuously run the generator for at least 72hours.A backup battery power source can also be utilized in lieu of a generator. If your facility hasa backup battery power source, it should be tested quarterly and serviced annually (check the manufacturer's guidance for testing procedures and maintenanceschedules). EmergencyPreparations Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention100Even if you have backup equipment or a generator, you should establish a working agreement with at least one alternative storage facility with a backup generator where vaccines can be appropriately stored and monitored in an emergency.

EmergencyPreparations Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention104For the safe transport and storage of vaccines, proper supplies are essential. Your facility should have a sufficient supply of materials needed for emergency vaccine transport of your largest annual inventory. Appropriate materialsinclude:Portable vaccine refrigerator/freezer units(recommended)Qualified containers andpack-outsHard-sided insulated orStyrofoamCoolant materials: frozen 8-ounce bottles that can be conditioned or 4\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C phase change materials(PCMs)Insulating materials such as bubble wrap or corrugated cardboard -enough to form two layers percontainerTemperature monitoring device for eachcontainerDo not use soft-sided coolers. Most commercially available soft-sided coolers are poorly insulated and likely to be affected by room or outdoortemperatures. EmergencyPreparations Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention105Frozen water bottles can be used as coolant packs if they are properly conditioned, which should take only a fewminutes:Hold the bottles under running tap water or submerge them in a sink filled with tap water until you can see a layer of water forming near the surface of theplastic.Once the ice block inside the bottle can spin freely, the bottle is ready to be used for packing.Use appropriate insulating materials, such as bubble wrap, to protect vaccines from direct contact with the waterbottles.Phase change materials (PCMs) at 4\u00b0C -5\u00b0C (39\u00b0F -41\u00b0F) can also be purchased to maintain proper temperatures. Follow the manufacturer's instruction for use to reduce the risk of freezing vaccines duringtransport.Do not use frozen gel packs or coolant packs from vaccine shipments to pack refrigerated vaccines. EmergencyPreparations Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention106Improper packing for transport is as risky for vaccines as a failed storage unit. To help make sure your vaccines arrive safely, follow your facility's emergency storage and handling plan and SOPs. These should include, at a minimum, the procedures and protocols outlined on the followingpages. EmergencyPreparations Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention107PackingIf possible, suspend vaccination activities before the onset of emergencyconditions.Contact the alternative vaccine storage facility before packing any vaccine to confirmthey can accept your vaccines forstorage.Take an inventory of your vaccines and record actions taken to protect thevaccines.Open unit doors only when absolutely necessary and after completing all preparations for packing and movingvaccines.Use appropriate materials forpacking.CDC has compiled recommendations on the methods and materials to use for emergency vaccine transport, Packing Vaccines for Transport during Emergencies, available on the Maine Immunization Programwebsite. EmergencyPreparations Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention108TransportIdentify primary and backup vehicles and drivers inadvance.Consider renting a refrigerated truck if you have a large quantity of vaccines or needto transport vaccines an extendeddistance.If using a noncommercial vehicle, only transport vaccines inside the passenger compartment (not in thetruck).Move transport containers directly to a preheated or precooledvehicle.Avoid leaving containers in areas where they are exposed to directsunlight.Check vaccine temperature upon arrival at the alternative vaccine storage facility, and store vaccines at recommended temperaturesimmediately.Check with the Maine Immunization Program for additional guidance and resources on emergency transport of vaccines, particularly in majoremergencies. EmergencyPreparations Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention109Transport ofDiluentsTransport diluents with their corresponding vaccines. Follow the manufacturer's guidance for specific temperaturerequirements.If diluents that are stored at room temperature (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F or 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) are going to be transported with refrigerated vaccines, they should be refrigerated in advance for aslong as possible so they do not raise the container temperature when placed with refrigerated vaccines. Place an insulated barrier (e.g., bubble wrap) between the diluents and conditioned water bottles or phase changematerials.Never freeze diluents, not even duringtransport. EmergencyPreparations Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention110The manufacturer does not recommend transporting frozen vaccines (V AR, ZVL, MMRV). If these vaccines must be transported during an emergency, CDC recommends using a portable vaccine freezer unit or qualified container and pack-out that maintains temperatures between -50\u00b0Cand-15\u00b0C (-58\u00b0F and5\u00b0F).Follow these steps for transporting frozenvaccines:Place a calibrated temperature monitoring device in the container as close as possible to thevaccines.Record the time vaccines are removed from the storage unit and placed in the container, the temperature during transport, and the time at the end of transport when the vaccines are placed in a stable storageunit.Immediately upon arrival at the destination, place vaccines in a freezer at a temperature rangebetween-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C (-58\u00b0F and5\u00b0F).Do not use dry ice, even for temporary storage. Dry ice might expose the vaccines to temperatures colder than -50\u00b0C (-58\u00b0F).If necessary, frozen varicella-containing vaccines that have not been reconstituted may be transported at refrigerator temperatures between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F). Frozen varicella-containing vaccines can be refrigerated for up to 72 continuous hours before reconstitution. Transported frozen varicella-containing vaccines cannot be put back in the freezer. They must be used ordiscarded. EmergencyPreparations Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention111Transport of Multidose Vials(MDVs)If absolutely necessary, a partially used vial may be transported to or from an off-site/satellite facility operated by the same provider, as long as the cold chain is properly maintained.However, a partially used vial cannot be transferred from one provider to another or across statelines. EmergencyPreparations Maine Center for Disease Control andPrevention112Use a continuous temperature monitoring device, preferably a digital data logger, for monitoring and recording while transportingvaccines:The continuous temperature monitoring device should have an accuracy of +/-0.5\u00b0C (+/--1\u00b0F).Place liquid or solid buffered probe material in a sealed vial directly with thevaccines.Keep the continuous temperature monitoring device display on top of vaccines so you can easily see thetemperatures.CDC does not recommend using cold chain monitors during transport since they provide limited data on temperature excursions that mayoccur.If you have concerns about vaccines or diluents that may have been compromised (exposed to inappropriate conditions or temperatures or handled improperly), label them as \"DO NOT USE\" and store them in appropriate refrigerated conditions (set apart from othervaccines).Immediately contact the vaccine manufacturer(s) for guidance. Do not discard thevaccines.
