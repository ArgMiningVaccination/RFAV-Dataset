Rev. 277 (2007) ................................ ................................ ............. ................................ ................................ ..................... 11 Federal Food HONORABLE SONIA SOTOMAYOR , ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT AND ACTING CIRCUIT JUSTICE FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT: Applicant Anthony Marciano, on behalf of himself and all other s similarly situated, brings this legal challenge seeking a Stay in this Honorable Court, and to ultimately, strike down an Emergency Use Authorized (EUA) Covid 19, adult - vaccination -mandate being imposed on him, and all New York City municipal workers , as a newly, created condition of employment with the City of New York . The EUA Covid 19 vaccination mandate at issue requires all NYC municipal employees to either submit to a Covid 19 vaccination , or be fired , losing any accrued time, vested pension, health benefits , and sadly, ending many careers . The EUA Covid 19 mandate went into effect on October 20, 202 1, and was supplemented on October 31, 202 1, (collectively the \"Vaccination Orders \"), authorized in an Emergency Executive Order No. 98, signed March 12, 2020, by the former Mayor of New Yor k City, Bill de Blasio. (App. 145 to App. 154). Your Applicant now comes before the Supreme Court , respectfully, seeking a Stay, to restore a State Court Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) that was granted to Appellant on December 14, 202 0, but then dissolved in error, upon removal of the case by the City Respondents to the District Court on December 15, 2020 , after losing in State Court. (App. 2: 87 to 135 ; App. 6: 132 - 161). On October 20, 2020, the challenged Vaccination Orders went into effect, signed by the NYC Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene , requiring an EUA Covid 19 vaccination for all NYC City municipal employees, and Certain City contractors . (App. 7 & 8: 145 - 154). Applicant's claim is that an EUA Covid 19 adult vaccination is prohibited by state and federal law in NYS from being mandated on adults , and, thus, the mandate is violating inter alia due process to refuse informed consent , rendering the Vaccination Orders void ab initio . Id. 2 A majority of this Court would likely agree the Mayor of the City of New York has no executive authority that permits him to mandate an EUA Covid 19 vaccination, that is pro hibited under existing NYS and federal laws from being imposed on any adult in NYC, employee or otherwise. Nonetheless, the challenged adult -vaccination -mandate requires all NYC municipal workers receive an EUA Covid 19 vaccination , with or without requisite informed consent, and\\or with or without a Judicial Order of Quarantine PHL \u00a72120 (3) , required by state and federal law, or be fired. Id. Although exemptions for medical and religious reasons were ostensibly permitted, out of an estimated 6000 exemption requests from members of the N.Y.P.D. alone, an estimated 97% have been denied. (App. 3: 69). Approximately , 1500 municipal workers have been fired thus far for refusing the EUA Covid 19 vaccination, and thousands more are still waiting for determinations on exemption appeals , to previously denied religious and medical exemptions , that will likely be terminated also. Thousands of other municipal employees and City residents have already acquiesced to the vaccination mandate(s) under duress, and many municipal employees face booster vaccinations to continue working in NYC without informed consent provided . (App. 91 - 92). Applicant now comes before the Supreme Court seeking a Stay, reinstating the dissolved State Court TRO, while his current appeal is pending in the Second Circuit . The Vaccination Orders should be Stayed because, among other reasons, the mandate is violating the due process rights of those adults affected withholding informed consent , and is causing them continuing , and future irreparable harm . Appellant, respectfully, asserts that a majority of this Court would likely agree that an EUA Covid 19 vaccination , adult -mandated is prohibited by state and federa l law in NY S, without uncoerced, informed consent . New York Public Health Law , PHL \u00a7 3 206(1)(l) ; New York Public Health PHL \u00a7 613; see also Garcia v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene, 31 N.Y.3d 601 (2018) . On June 24, 2021, the former Governor of the State of New York , Andrew Cuomo announced the \"Covid 19 Emergency\" was over in NYS . The Governor's unprecedented \"Emergency Powers ,\" extended to him on March 7, 2020 , in Executive Law 202 by the NYS legislature were fully rescinded on June 24, 2021, in Executive Law 205, and not a minute too soon. This unprecedented delegation of power by the NY Legisl ature to Governor Cuomo , to create and suspend laws and directives in response to the coronavirus was, in and of itself, an unconstitutional delegation of authority, violating the Separation of Powers Doctrine. (See Appendix 9: 2dc D.E. 100 @ pg. 1, Appel lant's Opening Brief ). In October of 2021, four (4) months after the Covid 19 emergency was declared over by former Governor Cuomo , former Mayor Bill de Blasio spontaneously, granted unto himself similar, extraordinary \"Emergency Powers\" to impose a serie s of unprecedented Covid 19 restrictions and mandates (A pp. 25 to 26 , 39, 44), including the now rescinded \"Key to NYC\", requiring vaccination passports to enter public buildings in the five boroughs of the City (App. 146), and the municipal employee Vaccination Orders , that are still effect and at issue in this case, that requir e all municipal employees receive the EUA Covid 19 vaccination (s) or be fired. (App. 146 - 151). This Court in National Federation of Independent Business, et al., (NFIB) v. Department of Labor , et al., No. 21A244 (Jan. 13, 2022), per curiam , granted a stay to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (\"OSHA\") challenged rule, mandating that employers with at least 100 employees require covered workers receive a COVID -19 vaccine, or submit to weekly PCR testing. The holding in NFIB is the legal authority applicable to Applicant's claims in this 4 case, challenging the Vaccination Orders , that are imposing an even stricter mandate than the OSHA's rule stayed by this Court earlier this year , that provides no testing option or alternative , and requir es all City municipal workers to be either vaccinated with Covid 19 or be terminated for cause . (App. 146 - 155). This Court's determination in NFIB , upholding the Fifth Circuit's stay in BST Holdings, L.L.C. v. Occupational Safety and Health Admin., 17 F. 4th 604, 609 (CA5 2021), has, respectfully, been overlooked here by the Second Circuit in denying Your Applicant nearly identical relief to Stay the Vaccination Orders . Each day more and more municipal workers are being fired for refusing the EUA Covid 19 mandate in a City riddled with crime, and rapidly decaying , in need of more, not less, skilled municipal workers. The Applicant, and all others similarly situated, are facing termination of employment for refusing informed consent to the Covid 19 employee mandate or have been fired already . Thus far approximately 1500 municipal workers have been fired for refusing the Covid 19 mandate , many others acquiesced under duress . The municipal workers who acquiesced are now facing more and more booster vaccines , even though by all accounts the Covid 19 emergency is over and was declared over in NYS by Governor Cuomo in June of 2021, four (4) months before the adult mandate was imposed in the Mayor's October 20, 2021, Emergency Order. (App. 108 to 109). The Secon d Circuit erred in denying the Stay because municipal employees are suffering a continuing , and future , irreparable harm that no money damage award could compensate, and moreover, any damages are speculative at best due immunity, sweeping federal preemption and liability protections for all EUA Covid 19 Countermeasures covering all liability claims . (App. 1 to 2, 57 to 62, 91) . 5 The only currently available Covid 19 vaccination being distributed in the United States is designated as an Emergency Use Authorize d (EUA) drug (App. 4 , 91-93, 100, 106) and is an unlicensed, vaccination prohibited by state and federal law in NYS from being mandated upon anyone without uncoerced, informed consent . (A-100, 106, 132). Upon information and belief, the licensed versions of the Covid 19 vaccinations are just that licensed but have no actual products behind them currently being distributed in the United States . This is likely due to a current lack of no -fault, liability protection to the pharmaceutical companies for injuries resulting from a licensed product . In contrast, a n EUA Covid 19 vaccination 's use implies informed consent , and this eliminat es complete liability to the manufacturers as a Covid 19 covered countermea sure. Thus, it is precisely because of the no -fault liability to the manufacturer, current federal and state law prohibit EUA drugs and products from being mandated in NYS . (Appendix 9, 2dc Dkt. # 100 at. Pgs. 13 -16, Appellant's Opening Brief). There is a split in the Circuits on the lawfulness of the EUA Covid 19 vaccination mandate s. In BST Holdings , the Fifth Circuit addressed the lack of emergency and arbitrariness of the federal OSHA mandates concisely, and preliminary restrained them. On January 26, 2022, OSHA officially withdrew the mandate. Applicant, respectfully, seeks for this Honorable Court to rule the same when it upheld the Fifth Circuit stay in BST Holdings . Indeed, to see the comparison between BST Holdings and this case, one need only swap out the name \"Joe Biden\" for \"Eric Adams\" and substitute \"OSHA mandate\" for \"Vaccination Orders\" to readily determine just how arbitrary and capricious Covid 19 mandate really is being applied to municipal workers refusing informed consent . According to a study done by Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare, Inc., less than 1% of adverse vaccination reactions are reported to the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 6 (VAERS).1 This is a significant finding because since December 11, 2020, when the first Emergency Use Authorized (EUA) Covid 19 vaccination became available, VAERS has reported as of June 10, 2022: 28,859 Deaths, 53,989 Permanent Disabilities, and 163,121 Hospitalizations attributed to the EUA Covid 19 vaccinations currently being distributed in the United States . The EUA Covid 19 vaccination is designed to target an allegedly, man -made coronavirus, that first was reported by health officials sometime in November of 2019 , causing worldwide pandemonium, fear, hysteria and millions of unconfirmed, reported deaths . A CDC Nationwide blood donor seroprevalence survey estimates that 94.7% of the U.S. population has developed antibodies against SARS -CoV -2 (the virus which causes the disease Covid 19) either from natural infection or vaccin ation.2 A 2021 Johns Hopkins Mortality Analysis report ed a 98.7% survival rate if infected with Covid 19 . This is promising news to all Americans who were terrified by Covid 19 , and its global death , destruction and hysteria .3 4 OPINIONS BELOW The decisions in this case in the lower courts are styled either Marciano v.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE Currently pending in the Second Circuit is the Applicant's Opening brief seeking to reverse Judgment entered March 15, 2022, (App. 3 to 32) incorporating the Memorandum and Order of the Hon. Jed S. Rakoff dated March 13, 2022, dismissing Applicant 's lawsuit with prejudice pursuant to Rule 12 (b)(6), for failure to state a claim. Id. A pplicant now comes before this Court with a renewed request for an Emerge ncy Stay, denied by the Second Circuit (App. 1 to 2), to reinstate the State Court TRO, which was dissolved in error upon removal to the District Court. (A pp. 248 - 284). Applicant requested below either review in th e Second Circuit of Applicant 's claims de novo with a preliminary injunction while the Appeal is pending, that stay being denied, or to reinstate the State Court TRO, and Certify a Question of Law back to the NYS Court of Appeals, on the state Court's highest ruling in Garcia vs. NYC Dept. of He alth and Mental Hygiene , and its holding on the preemption of adult vaccination Use Authorizations (EUA). A majority of this Court would likely agree r einstatement of the State Court TRO by this Court in the form of Stay is just and proper because , among other reasons, removal to the District Court, and dissolution of the state Court TRO by Judge Rakoff was an abuse of discretion overlooked in the Second Circuit. (App. 32 -34, 71 - 85). 9 Applicant , Anthony Marciano, is a Dete ctive with the New York City Police Department with a stellar performance record and ten (10) years of dedicated service to the police department and residents of the City of New York. (A pp. 131 ). He is by all accounts a hero.5 Applicant was deemed an essential worker and reported for duty throughout the early stages of the virus when its consequences were uncertain and predicted to be dire. Fortunately, Covid 19 has turned out to be far less lethal than forewarned by the experts leading the US Covid 19 Countermeasure response including Anthony Fauci, M.D., Bill Gates of Microsoft, Klaus Schwab of World Economic Forum (WEF), and other notable pandemic influencers. Today, many effective treatments for the disease are widely available too. By all accounts the emergency is over. (A pp. 131 to 132). Applicant is refusing coerced, informed consent to the EUA Covid 19 Countermeasure, adult -vaccination -mandate because, among other reasons, he acquired natural immunity as a front -line worker when h e was exposed to Covid 19 in the early stages of the virus \u2014a clear benefit of putting himself in harm's way in service to the citizens of the City of New York. (A pp. 49, 79 -80, 94, 100, 108, 130 ). The EUA Covid 19 vaccination has simply too many adverse consequences that Applicant is unwilling to risk, which is his legal, due process right to refuse in NYS (App. 80) Garcia v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene, 31 N.Y.3d 601 (2018). Applicant is a husband and father of three small children, he cannot and will not assume the health risks associated with an illegal, experimental EUA drug he does not need, and by does not have to submit to as part of his job, without informed consent (A131 -132). is refusing because an adult mandate is illegal in NYS without informed consent in the absence of a Judicial Order of Qua rantine. Id. (App. 100, App. 132 ). When an experimental drug is being involuntarily imposed on anybody in NYC, the Board of Health must petition the Supreme Court for a Judicial Order of Quarantine, when informed consent is withheld. Id. (App. 100, 133 ). PHL \u00a72120(3) , affords all municipal workers broad due process protections, such as Notice, an appointment of counsel, and the right to examine evidence in a due process hearing to refuse any drug or treatment, including EUA products . PHL \u00a72120(3) shifts burden of proof to the City to prove the there is a compelling government interest to be served, and the vaccination is the \"least restrictive\" alternative for achieving the public health objective . (App. 79, 100, 107 to 108 ). There is a balancing required by the legislature between a compelling government interest versus a fundamental personal right and, where there is a communicable disease health threat, that balance may well shift to the government. Eichner v. Dillon , 73 A.D .2d 431, 455 422 U.S. 563 , 975 (the \"substantial government interest\" cannot be achieved by less drastic means, i.e., the \"least restrictive alternative\"). Shelton v. Tucker , 364 U.S. 479, 488 (1960) ; City of New York v. Doe , 205 A.D.2d 469 (1st Dep't 1994) ; City of New York v. Antoinette R ., 165 Misc. 2d 1014 (Sup. Ct., Queens Co., 1995) . The same procedural due process balancing test for the timing of the holding of a hearing for judicial review must apply as well. Applicant and all other municipal workers refusing the vaccination, for whatever reasons, are being denied due process in that there have 11 been no due process hearings held as required under the NYS Public Health Law and NYC Health Code. See , to 132 ). Procedural History On December 7, 2022, Applicant commenced this hybrid Article 78/42 U .S.C \u00a71983 action in New York State Supreme Court, from which it was subsequently removed to the Southern District of New York, challenging the Vaccination Orders as invalid facially, preempted by state and federal law, and invalid as applied, as arbitrary and capri cious inter alia violating the substantive and procedural due process rights of all municipal workers to refuse the EUA Covid 19 vaccination without informed consent. (App. 56, 89, 129 -132). The Complaint clearly states \"Petitioner brings this hybrid action as an Article 78 proceeding in the nature of prohibition, pursuant to the New York State Civil Practice Law and Rules (\"CPLR\") \u00a77803 (2) , and as an action for Declaratory Judgment pursuant to CPLR \u00a7 3001 and 42 USC \u00a71983\" raising both a facial challenge and as applied challenge to the adult mandates.6 Id. (A -26).7 The Complaint asserted four claims: (1) \"separation of powers\" under the New York State Constitution, (2) preemption by state law and federal laws, (3) substantive due process, brought 6 The District Court in a footnote 6 to its decision stated : Although stylized as a hybrid complaint and Article 78 petition, nevertheless, because the complaint exclusively sought to challenge the Order on facial grounds, it was an Ar ticle 78 petition in name only. See Corbett v. City of New York, 816 Fed. App'x 551 (2020) (An Article 78 court \"may not rule on [a regulation's] facial validity \" v. F.3d 687, 695 (2d Cir. 1998) ). The District Court overlooked Applicant 's claim, is on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated and raised both a facial challenge and as applied challenge to the Vaccination Orders. The Vaccination Orders are facially invalid because they are preempted by the state and federal law, and unconstitutional as applied, because they are arbitrary and capricious violating due process. 7 As of the date of this Memorandum Opinion, Eric Adams is Mayor of the City of New York and Keechant Sewell is the New York City Police Commissioner. When a government official is sued in an official capacity and subsequently leaves office, the official's successor is automatically substituted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d) . 12 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 , and (4) procedural due process, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 . Id. (App. 8) . The challenged Vaccination Orders require that \"Any city employee who has not provided the proof described in Paragraph 2 must be excluded from the premises at which they work beginning on November 1, 2021.\" (A pp. 145 to 154 ), Paragraph 2 of the Vaccination Order requi res \"all City employees, except those employees described in Paragraph 5\" (\u00b6 5 refers to \"uniformed Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") employees\"), to submit proof that: a. they have been fully vaccinated against COVID -19; or b. they have received a single -dose C OVID -19 vaccine, even if two weeks have not passed since they received the vaccine; or c. they have received the first dose of a two -dose COVID -19 vaccine . (App. 145 - 165). On December 14, 2021, Applicant successfully obtained a Temporary Restraining Ord er (TRO) in State Court after a briefing and oral argument was conducted by the Hon. Frank P. Nervo, SCJ. (A pp. 87 - 135). The following day, on December 15, 2014, after losing in state Court, the City Respondents sought removal to the District Court and to dissolve the State Court TRO. (A pp. 12 to App. 13, 33 to 34) . Applicant opposed removal and sought to sever the state law claims by remanding them back to the State Court on the issue of the legality of an adult mandate in NYS (A pp. 12 ). Th e District Court denied that relief in error. The City Respondents never filed an answer, and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice all claims in error. ( App. 3 - 28). Removal was an abuse of discretion because Applicant was still able to amend his sta te law claims to remove the 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 claims, as of right, \"...[b]ecause no answer has yet 13 been filed, they were entitled to amend as of right. The amendment disposes entirely of their federal claim.\" Spehar v. (1994) , permits a district court, in its discretion, to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims if it has dismissed all federal claims. See Liberian Cmty. Ass'n of Conn. v. Lamont , 970 F.3d 174 (2d Cir. 2020) (amending judgment to reflect that the state law claims were dismissed without prejudice in a quarantine case). On March 22, 2022, in opposition to removal, Applicant sought to sever the state law issues of Preemption, Separation of Powers and Informed Consent by remanding them to back to State Court with the hard -earned TRO in place, which was denied on December 29, 2021. (A pp. 33 to 34 ). Notably, the same issues of state law regarding Preemption and Separation of Powers , raised by Applicant in suppor t of severance and removal, were later determined by Judge Rakoff in his March 8, 2022, Memorandum Order . denying the relief , to be questions of state law \"left open\" by the Court of Appeals in Garcia v NYC Dep't of Mental Health and Hygiene supra (App. - 19). A majority of this Court would likely agree that Removal and Dissolution of the State Court TRO was an abuse of discre tion because any state law questions deemed \"left open\" by the District Court by the Court of Appeals were best answered by the Court of Appeals, where this case was headed before removal. Id. Removal was improper because the \u00a71983 claims alleged are not even reached in this case, until the state law issues, already adjudicated by the Court of Appeals in Garcia restricting adult mandates were enforced in NYS Supreme Court against the City Respondents , where the case belonged. \"A decision of the Court of Appeals on these questions of state law might well resolve all the claims brought by the parties in the case before us, and to do so without requiring any 14 decision as to the validity of the statute und er the United States Constitution.\" Allstate Insurance Co. v. Serio , 97 Civ. 670 (RCC), 97 Civ. 23 (RCC), at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 7, 2003). Further, \"...when all federal claims are eliminated in the early stages of litigation, the balance of factors generally favors declining to exercise pendent jurisdiction...\" Tops Markets, Inc. v. Quality Markets, Inc. , 142 F.3d 90, 102 -03 (2d Cir. 1998 ). Generally speaking, \"where the federal claims had been dismissed at a relatively early stage and the remaining claims involved issues of state law t hat [are] unsettled...the exercise of supplemental or pendent jurisdiction [is] an abuse of discretion.\" Valencia ex rel. Franco v. Lee, 316 F.3d 299, 306 (2d Cir. 2003). On January 19, 2022, City Respondents then moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) for lack of standing and failure to state a claim, respectively, opposed by Applicant .(App. 5 - 7). The District Court denied the motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction but granted the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Id. The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on March 13, 2022 . An Appeal was timely filed in Second Circuit, t he Stay request was denied on August 2, 2022 . (App. 1 to 2). Applicant now requests relief in this Court, pending the outcome of his Appeal, to Stay the Vaccination Orders that are causing him, and all others similarly situated irreparable harm. REASONS FOR GRANTING THE APPLICATION The All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) , authorizes an individual Justice or the full Court to issue an injunction when (1) the circumstances presented are \"cr itical and exigent\"; (2) the legal rights at issue are \"indisputably clear\"; and (3) injunctive relief is \"necessary or appropriate in aid of the Court's jurisdiction.\" Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U.S. 15 1312 (1986) (Scalia, J., in chambers) (citations and alterations omitted) . The Court also has discretion to issue an injunction \"based on all the circumstances of the case,\" without its order \"be[ing] construed as an expression of the Court's views on the merits\" of the underlying claim. Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Sebelius, 571 U.S. 1171 (2014). A Circuit Justice or the full Court may also grant injunctive relief \"[i]f there is a 'significant possibility' that the Court would\" grant certiorari \"and reverse, and if there is a likelihood that irreparable injury will result if relief is not granted.\" Am. Trucking Ass'ns, Inc. v. Gray, 483 U.S. 1306, 1308 (1987) (Blackmun, J.); see also Lucas v. Townsend, 486 U.S. 1301, 1304 (1988) (Kennedy, J., in chambers) (considering whether there is a \"fair prospect\" of reversal). I. PREEMPTION A. The Vaccination Orders Are Void Ab Initio Violating The Separation Of Powers And Informed Consent Doctrines EUA Covid 19 Countermeasure, adult -vaccination -mandate s are preempted by state and federal law from being mandated in NYS. The preemption doctrine is most often applied where inferior levels of government have attempted to regulate despite pronouncements on the same subject at a higher governmental level. See, e.g ., New York State Club Assn. v City of New York, 69 N.Y.2d 211 ; Consolidated Edison Co. v Town of Red Hook, 60 N.Y.2d 99 ; Monroe - Livingston Sanitary Landfill v Town of Caledonia, 51 N.Y.2d see also Boreali v. Axelrod , 71 1, 14 -15 (N.Y. 1987) . In Garcia , the NYS Court of Appeals identified two (2) provisions of state's public health law explaining that PHL \u00a7206(1)(l) and PHL \u00a7613 preempt adult vaccination mandates in 16 NYS. Garcia , 31 N.Y.3d 601 , at 619, 620. \"A local law will be preempted either where there is a direct conflict with a state statute (conflict preemption) or where the legislature has indicat ed its intent to occupy the particular field (field preemption).\" (A pp. 48 ). There were no questions \"left open\" by the Court of Appeals with respect to adult mandates in NYS that are prohibited by law. (App. 19 ). 1. Conflict Preemption New York PHL \u00a7206 (1)(l) , general duties and responsibilities states, in relevant part: \"establish and operate such adult and child immunization programs as are necessary to prevent or minimize the spread of disease and to protect the public health... Nothing in this paragraph shall authorize mandatory immunization of adults or children, except as provide d in sections twenty -one hundred sixty -four and twenty -one hundred sixty -five of this chapter.\" Garcia at 840, 841. NYS PHL \u00a7613 (c), State aid: immunizations, similarly states, in relevant part : \"The commissioner shall invite and e ncourage the active assistance and cooperation in such education activities of: the medical societies, organizations of other licensed health personnel, hospitals, corporations subject to article forty -three of the insurance law, trade unions, trade associ ations, parents and teachers and their associations, organizations of child care resource and referral agencies, the media of mass communication, and such other voluntary groups and organizations of citizens as he or she shall deem appropriate... Nothing in this subdivision shall authorize mandatory immunization of adults or children, except as provided in sections twenty -one hundred sixty - four and twenty -one hundred sixty -five of this chapter.\" Id. The City's defense to preemption is that the Court of Appeals in Garcia had permitted Board of Health to mandate a flu vaccination, failing to distinguish the vaccination permitted in Garcia was a for a school required FDA licensed, immunization, already authorized by PHL \u00a72164 . (App. 20 ). Upon a plain reading of the decision in Garcia, it is clear City Respondents ' defense to preemption has no merit. In Garcia, the Court of Appeals permitted NYC's Board of Heal th to add a flu shot for toddlers to the school immunization schedule because the school 17 vaccines were licensed and legislatively authorized in PHL \u00a72164 and \u00a72165 , while advising at the same time, tha t NYS PHL \u00a7206(1 )(1) and PHL \u00a7613 prohibit adult mandates. Id. The Garcia Court held: \"The legislature intended to grant NYSDOH authority to oversee and encourage voluntary adult immunization programs, whil e ensuring that its grant of authority would not be construed as extending to the adoption of mandatory adult immunizations.\" Garcia , 31 N.Y.3d 601 at 842. The legislature has not authorized adult mandates in NYS . The Vaccination Orders are violating the Separation of Powers and Informed Consent Doctrines. The Court of Appeals decision in Garcia, clearly distinguished school required vaccinations from adult m andates with respect to the Board of Health's regulatory authority and left no questions of preemption unanswered. Id. 2. Field Preemption. On January 1, 2021, the NYS Legislature enacted PHL \u00a72180 -\u00a72182 , Novel Coronavirus Covid 19 Legislation, restricting available Covid 19 Countermeasures in NYS as limited to \"contact tracing\" only. ( App. 47, 93 ). The Novel legislation reads as follows: \u00a72180 . Definitions. As used in this title the following terms shall have the following meanings: 1. \"Contact tracing\" means Covid 19 case investigation and identification of case individuals and contact individuals. In January of 2021, when the NY Legislature enacted \u00a72180 -\u00a72182 , the law preemp ted an EUA Covid 19 vaccination as part of the allowable countermeasures because EUA drugs may not be mandated on adults or children under state and federal Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene, 31 N.Y.3d 601 (2018). 18 As discussed in Vatore v . Comm'r of Consumer Affairs of City of New York , \"Where the State has preempted an entire field, a local law regulating the same subject matter is inconsistent with the State's interests if it either (1) prohibits conduct which the State law accepts or at least does not specifically proscribe (see, New York State Club Assn . v. City of New York , 69 N.Y.2d 211, 221 , affd. 108 L.Ed.2d 1 ; Monroe - Livingston Caledonia , 51 N.Y.2d 679 , 683 ), or (2) imposes restrictions beyond those imposed by the State law (see, Robin v . Incorporated Vil . of Hempstead , 30 N.Y.2d 347 350 Vatore Consumer Affairs, 83 N.Y.2d 645, 649 (N.Y. 1994 ). The State's intention to preempt an entire field need not be specified in a law as \"Preemptive intent, however, may be inferred from the nature of the subject matter being regulated and the purpose and scope of the State legislative scheme. (See, Albany Area B ldrs. Assn . v. Town of Guilderland , 74 N.Y.2d 372, 377; Consolidated Edison Co . v. Town of Red Hook , 60 N.Y.2 d 99, 105 ).\" Id. Where such preemptive intent exists, the locality may not legislate \"unless it has received 'clear and explicit' authority to the contrary (Robin v Incorporated Vil. of Hempstead ., 30 N.Y.2d 347 , 350-351 (1972) ; Matter of Kress Co. v Department of Health of City of N.Y., 283 N.Y. 55, 60 (1940) (State's Agriculture and Markets Law's regulation of the manufacture and sale of frozen desserts held pr e-emptive).\" People v. De Jesus , 54 N.Y.2d 465, 469 (N.Y. 1981) . State laws preempt EUA Covid 19 adult -vaccination - mandates in NYS , and this applies equally to the NYS Commissioner of Health and NYC's Board of Health and cannot be such that it restricts adult vaccinations mandates without informed consent, but at the same time permits the City by fiat to impose adult vaccinations mandates on municipal employees. (App. 41 to 48, 94, 107, 129 to 132 ). And \"[v]iewed in that light, the agency's actions were a far cry from the 19 'interstitial' rule making that typifies administrative regulatory activity.\" Boreali v. Axelrod, 71 N.Y.2d 1, at 13 . 3. Federal Preemption In deciding whether federal law preempts state law, a court must (1) assess the comprehensive nature of the federal regulatory scheme; (2) determine if there is a dominant federal interest in the matter to be regulated and if there is a need for national u niformity; and (3) analyze the threat of conflict between state laws and the effective administration of the state program. Bravman v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 842 F. Supp. 747, 750 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (Sweet, J.) and Pennsylvania v. Nelson, 350 U.S. 497 (1956) . Supremacy clause analysis begins with the \"assumption that the histo ric police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by [a] Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\" Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947). Title 21, U.S.C. \u00a7360 bbb -3(e)(1)(ii)(I -III), Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ; Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA ) is a comprehensive, complex, well -developed, regulatory scheme that preempts mandating EUA drugs (USCA ECF #35). In John Doe #1 v. Rumsfeld, the Department of Defense (DoD) attempted to mandate an EUA Anthrax vaccine among service members despite its EUA status. A district court halted the mandate citing its lack of legislative authority and application to all persons being \"illegal absent informed consent\": \"The Court is persuaded that the right to bodily integrity and the importance of complying with le gal requirements, even in the face of requirements that may potentially be inconvenient or burdensome, are among the highest public policy concerns one could articulate...Absent a 32 informed consent or presidential waiver, the United States cannot demand th at members of the armed forces also serve as guinea pigs for experimental drugs.\" John Doe #1 v. Rumsfeld , 297 F.Supp.2d 119 (D.D.C.2003) John Doe #1 affirms Applicant 's position that mandates are incompatible with EUA products. addition, the 20 Vaccination Orders are preempted in NYS under state law. & Mental Hygiene , 31 N.Y.3d 601 , 617 (N.Y. 2018) . Based on preemption, Applicant , respectfully, seeks a ruling the Vaccination Orders violate the Separation of Powers Doctrine and Informed Consent Doctrines, and the City Respondents , should be temporarily, preliminarily and permanently enjoined as void ab initio . Id. B. The Vaccination O rders Are Arbitrary And Capricious The Vaccination Orders are arbitrary and capricious because they are both underinclusive and overinclusive in that they target certain municipal employees while excusing just about everyone else from the \"emergency\" manda te.8 (App. 84 ). The limitation of the Vaccination Orders to City employees undermines the claim that vaccinations are necessary emergency measures. For one thing, City employees are the people most easily punished for failing to comply. For another, th e alleged \"public health emergency\" can apparently be overlooked when there is \"a staff shortage at Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") facilities\" who are excused from the adult mandate due to a worker shortage, and for famous movie stars and ball players. (App.149 ). The Vaccination Orders are clearly arbitrary and capricious because a basketball player or theatre performer recently excused from the vaccination by the Mayor, is no less or no greater a risk than a police officer, member of the fire department , EMS worker, sanitation worker, or teacher doing their job in service to the City of New York required to be vaccinated or be 8 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/23/nyregion/nyc -vaccine -mandate -adams.html 21 terminated .9 The Vaccination Orders are arbitrary and capricious because they are including some individuals while arbitrarily excluding others, without a rational basis. The Fifth Circuit recently reaffirmed a Stay, barring OSHA from enforcing the November 5, 2021, Emergency Temporary Standard (the \"Mandate\") requiring employees of covered employers to undergo Covid 1 9 vaccination or take weekly Covid 19 tests and wear a mask. See BST Holdings, L.L.C. v. OSHA , 17 -60845, Cir. Nov. 12, 2021) . Under -inclusiveness is one of the reasons underpinning the Fifth Circuit's Stay in BST Holdings of the OSHA Mandate, because \"...this kind of thinking belies the premise that any of this is truly an emergency. Indeed, under -inclusiveness of th is sort is often regarded as a telltale sign that the government's interest in enacting a liberty -restraining pronouncement is not in fact 'compelling'...The underinclusive nature of the Mandate implies that the Mandate's true purpose is not to enhance workp lace safety, but instead to ramp up vaccine uptake by any means necessary.\" See BST Holdings, L.L.C. *20. The goal \"to ramp up vaccine uptake by any means necessary\" is not merely an inference. Mayor de Blasio sta ted as much in media appearances around the mandate. (App. 67) The Vaccination Orders are arbitrary and capricious violating due process. Under applicable Public Health Laws and NYC Health Code, any person subject to an involuntary, unlicensed drug ( EUA vaccine) is entitled to refuse an unauthorized medical intervention and is entitled to a due process hearing under PHL \u00a72120 (3), and 24 RCNY \u00a711.23 , when informed consent is withheld. The failure to pr ovide any municipal employee with a due process hearing is 9 https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/mayor -adams -fired -nyc-workers -can-get-their-jobs- back -if-they-get-vaccinated/ 22 arbitrary and capricious, and thus, the Vaccination Orders should be struck down as causing irreparable harm to all NYC employees affected by the mandate. Further, the Covid 19 \"emergency\" is over . (App. 131 ). Covid 19 is now another \"on - going\" health concern. Id. New York City is no longer experiencing the widespread crisis that marked the spring of 2020, attributed mostly to controversy over a spike in nursing home deaths. According to Respondent 's own expert Dr. Jay Varma's honest assessment of Covid 19 is an \"ongoing public health concern\", and not a \"widespread crisis\". Dr. Varma's findings do not support the a \"state of emergency\" declaration, as claimed by the Mayor and the Health Commissione r, in justification of the exercise of their emergency powers in direct violation of the New York Public Health Law and Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act restrictions on coerced informed consent. (App. 106 to 107 ). See BST Holdings , L.L.C. v. OSHA , No. 21 -60845, Slip Op. at *19 (5th Cir. Nov. 12, 2021); Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. (NFIB ) , No. 21A244 (Jan. 13, 2022). This Court's determination in NFIB , upholding the Fifth Circuit in BST Holdings is binding on th e Second Circuit . In BST Holdings , the Fifth Circuit addressed the lack of emergency and arbitrariness of the federal OSHA mandates concisely and struck them down. Indeed, to see the striking similarities between BST Holdings and this case, one need only swap out the name \"Joe Biden\" for \"Eric Adams\" and substitute \"OSHA mandate\" for \"Vaccination Orders\" to readily determine just how arbitrary and capricious the mandate being applied to handful of municipal workers refusing an illegal, adult vaccination mandate real ly is. (A pp. 41 to 48, 94, 107, 129 to 132 ). The Fifth Circuit stated in BST Holdings: \"On the dubious assumption that the Mandate does pass constitutional muster \u2014which we need not decide today \u2014it is nonetheless fatally flawed on its own terms. Indeed, 23 the Mandate's strained prescriptions combine to make it the rare government pronouncement that is both overinclusive (applying to employers and employees in virtually all industries and workplaces in America, with little attempt to account for the obvious d ifferences between the risks facing, say, a security guard on a lonely night shift, and a meatpacker working shoulder to shoulder in a cramped warehouse) and underinclusive (purporting to save employees with 99 or more coworkers from a \"grave danger\" in th e workplace, while making no attempt to shield employees with 98 or fewer coworkers from the very same threat). The Mandate's stated impetus \u2014a purported \"emergency\" that the entire globe has now endured for nearly two years, and which OSHA itself spent nea rly two months responding to \u2014is unavailing as well. And its promulgation grossly exceeds OSHA's statutory authority.\" See BST Holdings v. Occupational Safety & Health Admin. , 17 F.4th 604 , 611 -12 (5th Cir. 2021). Id. 1. School vs. Adult Mandates The District Court, respectfully, erred overlooking that EUA Covid 19 vaccinations cannot be mandated in NYS because the EUA versions are unlicensed drugs, and more important, there is no adult vaccination mandate allowable in the NYS' legislation, in contrast to the legislation authorizing school required vaccination schedule found in PHL \u00a72164 and \u00a72165, student immunizations . (SPA - 21). See Garcia v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene , 31 N.Y.3d 601 , 619 (N.Y. 2018). This key difference between the school required vaccinations in PHL \u00a72164 and \u00a72165 , allowable by state statute, in contrast to an adult mandate preempted by state statute, PHL \u00a7206(1)(l) and PHL \u00a7613 , were clearly articulated by the Court of Appeals in Garcia , and were overlooked by the District Court deeming these questions of state law were \"left open\" in Garcia . Id. The District Court in dismissing the case chose instead to rely upon December 2020 Second Department Appellate Division decision in C.F. v New York City Dept. of Health & Mental Hygiene , 191 AD3d 52 (NY App. Div. 2020) , interpreting C.F. as extending legislative authority to the Board of Health to impose an adult, unlicensed EUA Covid -19 vaccination, 24 without informed consent, on municipal workers being terminated for refusing. (App. 42 -43). V.S. v. Muhammad , 595 F.3d 426, 432 (2d Cir. 2010) (a federal court \"is bound to apply the law as interpreted by a state's intermediate appellate courts unless there is persuasive evidence that the state's highest court would reach a different conclusion\"). Id. A majority of this Court would likely agree the Second Circuit erred in denying the Stay because Court of Appeals holding in Garcia is \"persuasive evidence that the state's highest court would reach a different conclusion.\" Bone v. CNA Fin. Corp. , 20 CV 6073 (VB), at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Sep. 22, 2021). The Court of Appeals in Garcia not only distinguished school required vaccinations from adult mandates, but also has previously, clearly, rejected similar holdings to the C.F. case, sharply curtailing the Board of Health's perceived \"unique\" legislative authority, striking down cigarette bans and soda cup si ze regulations when it deemed NYC's Board of Health to be delving too far into fundamental, legislative decision making reserved for the legislature, violating the Separation of Powers Doctrine. (A pp. 94 ). See Boreali v. Axelrod , 71 464, 1355 (1987) (\"It is an 'oft -recited principle' in New York 'that the legislative branch of government cannot cede its fundamental policy -making responsibility to an administrative agency. '\" Id at 9, and see, Matter of N.Y. Statewide Coal. of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce v. N.Y.C.

We disagree.\"). If C.F. had been appealed to the Court of Appeals, it likely would have been reversed under the authority of Garcia, Bore ali and NY Hispanic Chambers of Commerce, supra. Clearly, if the state's highest Court has previously determined the Board of Health lacks legislative 25 authority to ban cigarette smoking, and dictate the size of a soda cup, the Court of Appeals would not pe rmit the imposition of an unprecedented, adult vaccination mandate by fiat, for an experimental EUA Covid -19 vaccination, preempted under state and federal law from being mandated on adults without uncoerced, informed consent . (App. 46, 101). In C.F., the Second Department upheld the Board of Health 's authority to impose an FDA licensed, adult measles vaccine in 2019, for a few weeks that quickly expired, thus, moot ing the case. (App. 18, 42 - 43). A majority of this Court would likely agree the Second Department, in C.F., erred in that case when imposing a measles vaccine (that was FDA Approved)10 on adults prohibited by Garcia . The nuisance ordinance upheld in C.F. had been issued by the Board of Health during a measles \"inbreak\" in Brooklyn where, it is believed, that certain religious observants were spreading measles to avoid vaccinations that violated their sincerely held religious beliefs contrary to the practice of vaccinating and affected approximately eight (8) adults . Id. A majority of this Court would also likely agree a plain reading of Garcia shows the NYS Court of Appeals left no question open as to the distinction between school required vaccinations allowable in PHL \u00a72164 and \u00a72165 , and adult preempted by state law PHL \u00a7206(1)(l) and PHL \u00a7613 being imposed in the Vaccination Orders . The District Court in relying on C.F. over Garcia 's clear holding , is reversible error , and the Second Circuit's denial of the Stay an abuse of discretion . (App. 19) A majority of this Court would likely agree, as it did in NFIB , the City Respondents' have no inherent legislative authority to engage in fundamental, medical policy decision reserved 10 The vaccine known as MMR or MMRV. The and chicken pox. 26 for the legislature . Per the NYS Court of Appeals, \"In Boreali we held t hat, under the separation of powers doctrine, the Public Health Council went beyond its lawfully delegated authority when it promulgated comprehensive regulations governing tobacco smoking in areas open to the public. We determined that the Council had usu rped the role of the Legislature when, rather than employing its public health expertise in making technical determinations to implement legislative policies, the Council engaged in a balancing of political, social, and economic factors and drew up a 'code embodying its own assessment of what public policy ought to be.'\" Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Conservation , 71 N.Y.2d 186, 191 -92 (N.Y. 1988) . The Mayor has no authority to enact an unprecedented, EUA Covid 19 adult, vaccination mandate on municipal employee s in NYC that is preempted by state and federal law from being mandated on anyone . \"The Court of Appeals concluded the 'agency stretched that statute [the legislative grant of authority] beyond its constitutionally valid reach when it uses the statute as a basis f or embodying its own assessment of what public policy ought to be' Boreali v. Axelrod, 71 N.Y.2d 1 , 9 (N.Y. 1987)\" N.Y. Statewide Coal. of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene , 2013 N.Y. Slip Op. 3 0609, 11 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2013) . Even if this Court was somehow persuaded City Respondents have some authority to mandate a vaccine on adults (FDA licensed ) than their actions would still be nonetheless ultra vires , and well beyond the scope of any regulatory authority because, among other reasons, fortunately, there is no longer a Covid 19 emergency in NYS. The Hon. Lizette Colon, J.S.C., Richmond County Supreme Court, observed, regarding Respondent Mayor's Emergency Executive Order 225, \"The current pandemic status, despite its worldwide impact, does not seem to meet the first element necessary to declare a state of emergency under the quoted language of 27 New York City's code ('an act of violence or a flagrant and substantial defiance of or resistance of a law ful exercise of public authority...').\" Indep. Rest. Owners Ass'n Rescue (I.R.O.A.R.) v. Ct. 2021 ). (App. 145 -155). The Vaccination Orders as written do not support the City ' claim that the required Vaccination of City employees is a necessary response to a \"public health emergency.\" Id. The \"WHEREAS\" clauses state \"City employees and City contractors provide services to all New Yorkers that are critical to the health, safet y, and well -being of City residents, and the City should take reasonable measures to reduce the transmission of Covid 19 when providing such services\". The determination by the Health Commissioner, a mayoral appointee, as to what measures are \"reasonable\" does not justify violating state law, and municipal worker's constitutional and civil rights to refuse . These are rights protected by state and federal law . Id. The \"WHEREAS\" clauses, citing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\"), also s tate \"the [CDC] reports that new variants of Covid 19, identified as \"variants of concern\" have emerged in the United States.\" Id. (EXHIBIT 1). The City Respondents' concerns simply do not justify the disregard of municipal workers due process rights to t he statutory protections preempting EUA Covid 19 Countermeasure requiring informed consent, nor do their concerns permit the City to contravene duly enacted legislation of the New York Senate and Assembly prohibiting adult vaccination mandates. See PHL \u00a720 6 (1)(l) and PHL \u00a7613 . The Court of Appeals left no question open in Garcia as to preemption of adult mandates when permitting the Board of Health to add a flu shot for toddlers to the already, statutorily authorized school schedule in PHL \u00a72164 , \u00a72165. Id. There is no corresponding adult vaccination schedule in NYS for the Board of Health to append an EUA Covid 19 adult mandate 28 to by fiat. See Garcia, Boreali and N.Y. Statewide Coal. of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce. Id. \"The point is simply this: if there is any new reason to doubt an earlier federal court's decision as to state law, the state's highest court should be given the opportunity to weigh in.\" Tapia v BLCH 3rd Ave. LLC , 906 F3d 58, 65 (2d Cir 2018) . (App. 40 - 41). A majority of this Court would likely agree if there w as a statutor ily, authorized adult schedule in NYS, the Respondent Board of Heal th could have simply added the Covid 19 vaccination to the adult schedule, in the same way the Board of Health added the flu shot for toddlers to the school schedule in 2018. See Garcia v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene, 31 N.Y.3d 601 , 604 -05 (N.Y. 2018). Since there is no adult schedule to add to in NYS, the Mayor conjured up the Emergency Executive Order 98, and the Board of Health manufactured the unprecedented Vaccination Orders , violating state and federal law, and Applicant 's substantive and procedural rights of due process to withhold uncoerced informed consent to mandate . (App. 145 - 155). 2. Police Power In 1905, the Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts , a landmark, vaccine -refusal case, upheld a smallpox vaccination mandate for the adult population based on a criminal statute imposing a $5 dollar fine as a valid exercise of police power . 197 U.S. 11 (1905) . The unlicensed, EUA Covid 19 Countermeasure vaccination mandate , at issue here, is dramatically different from the sole (discontinued) smallpox vaccine of more than a century ago, and of questionable necessity, proportionality, and harm avoidance particu larly in the absence of true emergency. Jacobson requires that a compulsory vaccination be made possible only in highly circumscribed situations: when there is \"an emergency,\" \"imminent [society 's] members\" and when the epidemic 29 \"imperil[s] an entire population.\" Id. at 29, 27, 29, 31. The Jacobson Court did not recognize or condone unlimited authority to mandate every vaccine , EUA or otherwise, that exist s today. In 1905, Henning Jacobson was never at risk of being forc ibly vaccinated without consent. Today, in NYS, EUA Covid 19 countermeasure vaccinations cannot be mandated on adults without uncoerced informed consent by law. The Court stated in Jacobson that a public health initiative to control disease is constitutionally permissible only if the powers exercised conform with principles of fairness and necessity, i.e., comply with the statutes. Under Jacobson's legacy, the legitimacy of the licensed vacci nation may not go \"beyond what was reasonably required for the safety of the public.\" Jacobson , 197. U.S. 11, at 28. There must exist a reasonable relationship between the legislation and the achievement of a public health objective. Id. at 26. Justice Harlan writing for the majority stated in circumstances where the \"regulations [are] so arbitrary and oppressive in particular cases...justify the interference of the courts to prevent wrong and oppression.\" Jacobson, 197 U.S. 11, at 38 -39. The mandating of unlicensed vaccinations on municipal workers must conform with the state and federal laws that extend far beyond Jacobson's constitutional minimums, and cannot be \"a plain, palpable invasion of rights.\" Id. at 31. (A -237). This case square ly addresses the type of overreach against which the Jacobson Court expressly forbid as an exercise of police power . Id. To force front line, essential workers, who have suffered so much already, to play Russian Roulette and risk injury from an unlicensed, illegal EUA Covid 19 Countermeasure vaccination, without the possibility of a damage claim for any loss other than physical injury or death, would be \"cruel and inhuman to the last degree,\" especially when its punishing front lin e municipal workers and no one else. The challenged 30 actions of the City Respondents fail every aspect of the Jacobson's fairness and reasonable test violating municipal workers substantive and procedural due process rights to refuse uncoerced , informed consent. The Vaccination Orders should be struck down as void ab initio and unconstitutional. Id. The federal restrictions on mandating EUA drugs, and the NY legislature's guarantee of due process protections in PHL \u00a7206(1) , \u00a7613 and PHL \u00a72120 (3) go far beyond what the Supreme Court, and this Court have declared as the minimum with respect to the constitutional rights of refusers to avoid an otherwise legal vaccination mandate. See We the Patriots U.S., Inc. v. Conn. Office of Early Childhood Dev., CIVIL 3:21cv597 (JBA), at *25 (D. Conn. Jan. 11, 2022) . C. The Vaccination Orders Violate Procedural And S ubstantive Due Process. 1. Due Process Applicant 's due process rights are not predicated solely upon a Fourteenth Amendment due process right to refuse an otherwise lawful vaccination mandate for that relief would be no different than the relief Jacobson sought in 1905. (SPA -22). \"This argument is forec losed by the Supreme Court's decision in Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 , 25 S.Ct. 358, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905).\" , 775 F.3d 538, 542 (2d Cir. 2015) . Here, today in NYS, an adult mandate for an EUA Covid 19 Countermeasure, unlicensed vaccine, is covered under complex federal regulations, and statutory restrictions that require either uncoerced informed consent or a Judicial Order of Quarantine for any unwanted unlicensed, drug or device, not otherwi se authorized by law. 31 A majority of this Court would likely agree the due process rights are not derived directly from the Constitution itself, but rather from the state and federal statutes that protect municipal workers' rights to refuse informed consen t. See Matter of K.L , 1 N.Y.3d 362, 372 (N.Y. 2004) ; Rivers v. Katz , 67 N.Y.2d 485, 496 -98 (N.Y. 1986) . Viewing the adult mandate the Applicant is facing solely through the lens of Jacobson, as the District Court's decision seems to do, is both incomplete and insufficient to protect the constitutional rights to refuse informed consent protected by the state and federal statute. (SPA -22). The state and federal law and regulations go far beyond Jacobson's due process minimums. \"The Supreme Court and the Second Circuit both have held that the \"Constitution embodies no fundamental right that in and of itself would render vaccine requirements imposed in the public interest, in the face of a public health emergency, unconstitutional.\" Id. at 293 (citing Jacobson , 197 U.S. at 25 -31, 37; Phillips , 775 F.3d at 542 -43.) In light of the Second Circuit's recent reliance o n Jacobson , Plaintiffs' contention at oral argument that it is outdated and nonbinding lacks force here. Id. at 293 n.35, 294 (\" Jacobson remains binding precedent.\"). We the Patriots U.S., Inc. v. Conn. Office of Early Childhood Dev. , CIVIL 3:21cv597 (JBA), at *25 (D. Conn. Jan. 11, 2022). A majority of this Court would likely agree this case is not about police power to mandate a legislatively authorized vaccination as erroneously determined below . The Vaccination Orders should be Stayed because they are violating state and federal statutes, causing irreparable harm to all municipal workers affected being denied due process in refusing informed consent. 32 a. PHL \u00a72120 , Control of Communicable PHL \u00a72120(3) , states: \"The magistrate after due notice and a hearing, if satisfied that the complaint of the health officer is well founded and that the afflicted person is a source of danger to others, may commit the said person to any hospital or institution established for the care of persons suffering from any s uch communicable disease or maintaining a room, ward or wards for such persons.\" In making the determination whether mandatory treatment is constitutional, courts apply the same substantive and procedural due process standards as they would for any seriou s deprivation of liberty, i.e., the same standards applicable to isolation and quarantine. See Matter of Sampson, 29 N.Y.2d 900 (N.Y. 1972) . These include a finding that the th reat to the community is supported by \"clear and convincing evidence,\" and that mandatory treatment is the \"least restrictive alternative.\" See O'Connor v. Donaldson , 422 U.S. 563 , 975 (the \"substantial government interest\" cannot be achieved by less drastic means, i.e., the \"least restrictive alternative\"). It would be difficult for City Respondents , if not impossible, to show by clear and convincing evidence how a municipal employee with acquired natural immunity, asymptomatic, would meet the burden of proof required under PHL\u00a72120 (3) to obtain a Judicial Order of Quarantine, satisfying the broad due process protections afford ed to municipal employees refusing the EUA mandate, which by law, cannot be mandated. It is highly unlikely the Board of Health could meet its burden of proof under PHL \u00a72120, by clear and convincing evidence showing how a person, asymptomatic, with natur al immunity is a health risk, or demonstrating how an EUA Covid 19 vaccination is the \"least restrictive\" alternative for achieving the public health goal. The City Respondents would have to disclose their evidence of vaccine safety and efficacy in a Court of Law, for scrutiny and 33 inspection by Applicant 's experts and the Court \u2014something the government has never been called upon to do before in any Court proceeding, with respect to any Covid 19 Countermeasures. This is significant because v accinations are a n area of science \"bereft of complete and direct proof of how vaccines affect the human body. \" Althen v. Sec'y of HHS, 418 F.3d 1274, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2005) . Typically, when a licensed, legislatively authorized vaccination mandate is challenged, say for example, a school required immunizations in PHL \u00a72164 , \u00a72165 , the government is entitled to a \"high degree of judicial deference,\" and it is a petitioner's \"heavy burden\" to demonstrate that health department's actions are \"unreasonable and unsupported by any evidence,\" Home of The Franciscan Sisters v. Novello; 7 NY3d 538, 544 (2006 ); quoting Consolation Nursing Home, Inc. v Comm'r of New York State Dep't of Health, 85 NY2d 326, 331 (1951) . PHL \u00a72120 (3), shifts the burden of proof to the City Respondents , a burden they cannot meet. b. NYC Health Code, 24 RCNY \u00a711.23 , (k) Removal and Detention of Cases, Contacts and Carriers Who Are or May Be a Danger to Public Health, Other Orders. (A -37) 24 RCNY \u00a711.23 (k) states: \"(k) In addition to the removal or detent ion orders referred to in subdivision (a) of this section, and without affecting or limiting any other authority that the Commissioner may otherwise have, the Commissioner may, in his or her discretion, issue and seek enforcement of any other orders that h e or she determines are necessary or appropriate to prevent dissemination or transmission of contagious diseases or other illnesses that may pose a threat to the public health including, but not limited to, orders requiring any person or persons who are no t in the custody of the Department to be excluded; to remain isolated or quarantined at home or at a premises of such person's choice that is acceptable to the Department and under such conditions and for such period as will prevent transmission of the con tagious disease or other illness; to require the testing or medical examination of persons who may have been exposed to or infected by a contagious disease or who may have been exposed to or contaminated with dangerous amounts of radioactive materials or t oxic chemicals; to require an individual who has been exposed to or infected by a contagious disease to complete an appropriate, prescribed course of 34 treatment, preventive medication or vaccination , including directly observed therapy to treat the disease and follow infection control provisions for the disease; or to require an individual who has been contaminated with dangerous amounts of radioactive materials or toxic chemicals such that said individual may present a danger to others, to undergo decontami nation procedures deemed necessary by the Department. Such person or persons shall, upon request, be afforded an opportunity to be heard, but the provisions of subdivisions (a) through (j) of this section shall not otherwise apply.\" NYC's own Health Code requires a Court Order be obtained by the Board of Health from a magistrate to impose any mandatory drug involuntarily within the City of New York, affording the same due process protections as the state law PHL \u00a72120 (3), Judicial Order of Quarantine. 24 RCNY \u00a711.23 . c. NYS PHL \u00a7\u00a72440 \u00a72442 . Informed consent, states: \"No human research may be conducted in this state in the absence of the voluntary informed consent subscribed to in writing by the human subject. If the human subject be a minor, such consent shall be subscribed to in writing by the minor's parent or legal guardian. If the human subject be otherwise legally unable to render consent, such consent shall be subscribed to in writing by such other person as may be legally empowered to act on behalf of the human subject. No such voluntary informed consent shall inclu de any language through which the human subject waives, or appears to waive, any of his legal rights, including any release of any individual, institution or agency, or any agents thereof, from liability for negligence.\" (A -23). PHL \u00a72442 applies because the EUA Covid 19 vaccinations are unlicensed, and thus are considered \"experimental\" and their use is restricted unless uncoerced, informed consent is obtained in writing under state law. The right of informed consent to refuse unwant ed, unlicensed drugs, are not only deeply rooted in myriad ethical, philosophical, and legal foundations of this nation, but are the pivotal principles articulated by the Nuremberg Declaration and form the basis for internationally recognized fundamental human rights protections . See, e.g., TRIALS OF WAR CRIMINALS BEFORE THE NUREMBERG 35 MILITARY TRIBUNAL COUNCIL LAW No. 10, at 181 -82 (1997), also see In Re Cincinnati Radiation Litig ., 874 F. Supp. 796, 816 -18 (S.D. Ohio 1995) 2. Level of Scrutiny While many things have changed in the world since Jacobson 's case was decided it still remains the supreme law on police power in the United States. The Supreme Court held that mandatory vaccination was within the State's police power. Zucht v. King, 260 U.S. 174, 176 (1922) (\" Jacobson ... settled that it is wit hin the police power of a state to provide for compulsory vaccination.\"). Phillips v. City of New York , 775 F.3d 538 , 542 (2d Cir. 2015). Yet, undeniably, with the advent of the electron microscope and advances in medicine, a great deal has changed over the course of the last century, not least the way the Supreme Court views personal autonomy, the right to informed consent and the right to medical decision - making. In Jacobson , the Supreme Court's standard of review was only rational basis. Jacobson's fine was $5, and the Supreme Court applied a rational basis standard upholding the Massachusetts ordinance. This case is different. It requires intermediate scrutiny, if not strict scrutiny because it involves statutory interpretations that exclude adult vaccination mandates in NYS, protecting municipal worker's fundamental liberty interests. It is undisputed on ce vaccinated the p erson cannot be unvaccinated . The EUA Covid 19 adult mandate is imposing on fundamental liberty interests protected and inherent in the statutes. City of Cleburne Texas v. Cleburne Living Center , 473 U.S. 432 (1985) . To view New York's vaccination mandates solely through the lens of the police power , as the District Court seems to do, without considering Applicant s' liberty interests protected by statute, is to look at only one side of a two -faced coin. A majority of this Court would likely agree the District Court misapprehended Applicant s' \u00a71983 claims because the procedural and due process violations alleged are not 36 derived directly from the 14th Amendment in and of itself. The due process rights are inherent in state and federal laws protecting municipal workers' First, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional rights to refuse informed consent . The state and federal laws preempting adult mandates without informed consent protect a citizen's religious beliefs contrary to the practice of vaccinating, property interests and rights in their jobs, rights of bodily integrity to refuse an experimental EUA drug, and to protect the procedural and due process rights afforded to municipal workers in the judicial process being sidestepped by avoiding a Judicial Order of Quarantine required by PHL \u00a72120 (3). While it is understood the legislature could likely ma ndate an adult Covid 19 vaccination that was licensed in NYS, the fact is when the opportunity was available to the legislature, the 2021 Novel Coronavirus Covid 19 legislation preempted all countermeasures to \"contact tracing.\" See PHL \u00a72180 -\u00a72182 Moreover, the vaccination is unlicensed by the FDA and requires informed consent. Thus, when a state legislature does make legislative determinations excluding adult mandates and preempting EUA Covid 19 vaccination countermeasures, the statutes must be applied lawfully and equally to everyone . Id. For example, \"[t]he United States Constitution mandates that, if New York wishes to allow a religiously based exclusion from its otherwise compulsory program of immunization... it may not limit this exception from the program to members of specific religious groups but must offer the exemption to all persons who sincerely hold religious beliefs that prohibit the inoculation... See Sherr v. Northport -East Northport U. F. Supp. 81, 98 (E.D.N.Y. 1987) . 11 The s ame holds true here. If the applicable state 11 NYS \u00a72165 (9) provides for religious exemptions to adults attending school. NYS repealed \u00a72164(9) for school children k - 12th grade in June of 2019. 37 and federal laws preempt unlicensed, EUA Covid 19 vaccination, c ountermeasure , adult - mandates , then those same laws must protect equally and fairly all adults, including all NYC municipal employees refusing info rmed consent. Since the 1960's, the Supreme Court has established clear precedents under the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause requiring states to prove that their interference in medical autonomy is \"necessary, and not merely rationally related to, the accomplishment of a permissible state policy.\" Griswold v. Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479, 497 (1965) (citing McLaughlin v. Florida , 379 U.S. 184 (1964) ). In the 1990's, the Supreme Court set limits on state interference with medical autonomy in three landmark cases: Cruzan v. Dir., Mo. Dept't of Health , 261 (1990 ), Washington v. Harper , 494 U.S. 210 (1990) and Washington v. Glucksberg , 521 U.S. 702 (1997) . Considering these precedents, the reasoning supporting bodily integrity and medical decision making locates a constitutionally protected, fundamental liberty interest in refusing unw anted, experimental medical treatment, not authorized by law in NYS, without informed consent or a Judicial Order of Quarantine. Cruzan found that the \"freedom from unwanted medical attention is unquestionably among those principles 'so rooted in the tra ditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental'\". Cruzan at 305 (quoting Snyder v. Mass ., 291 U.S. 97, 105 (1934) ). The Supreme Court has upheld two distinct and con tradictory lines of cases that pertain to state vaccination mandates - one focused on collective health and the limits of individual rights, and the other focused on the fundamental rights to liberty and bodily integrity. See B. Jessie Hill, The Constitut ional Right to Make Medical Treatment Decisions: A Tale of Two Doctrines , 86 Tex. L. Rev. 277 (2007) . Because both lines of cases pertain to Applicant 's challenges, it is 38 critical that this Court inquire the Vaccination Orders meet the requirements of intermediate or strict scrutiny. Jacobson requires for courts to assess the constitutionality of vaccination mandates; courts may not defer blindly to state authorities. Jacobson at 29 -35. The Second Circuit has previously stated that New York's vaccination program is \"well within the State's police power and thus its constitutionality is too well established to require discussion.\" Caviezel v. Great Neck Pub. Sch ., 500 F.App'x 16 (2d Cir. 2012), citing McCart ney v. Austin , 31 A.D.2d 370 (3d Dep't 1969) . This assertion does not address EUA adult vaccination mandates without informed consent, and the due process requirements of the statutes that still apply to police power even in a perceived emergency. Jacobson , 197 U.S. 11 , at 29, 27, 29, 31. \"[E]ven in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.\" Agudath Isr. v. Cuomo , 983 F.3d 620, 635 -36 (2d Cir. 2020) Jacobson hardly offers states carte blanche it goes further still. It requires that if vaccination mandates are arbitrary and unreasonable, then courts must \"interfere for the protection\" of those affected. Id. at 28. Jacobson foresaw that there might be vaccination mandates that are so arbitrary the Supreme Court considered it \"the duty of the courts to so adjudge.\" Id. at 31. In short, Jacobson does not permit executive or regulatory agencies to impose whatever mandates they like; it requires that courts assess the constitutionality of the manda tes individually, as the Supreme Court did for the sole mandate in Jacobson . The burden of proof is on the City. See PHL \u00a72120 (3). The sweeping assertion in Caviezel that the constitutionality of vaccination mandates is \"too well established to require discussion\" has a profound and tragic legacy. Id. It was precisely this judicial outlook that led the Supreme Court in 1927 to affirm the constitutionality of 39 Virginia's compulsory eugenic sterilization law in Buck v. Bell . 274 U.S. 200 (1927) . Oliver Wendell Holmes, writing for the majority, stated \"the principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is b road enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.\" Id. at 207. This misguided, eugenic decision led directly to the compulsory sterilization of tens of thousands of poor, minority and working -class Americans bei ng between the 1920's and mid -1970's. Today, forced sterilization is considered a war crime, yet the Supreme Court sustained its constitutionality through its overbroad interpretation of Jacobson. Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Art. 8(2)( b)(ii) (1998) . Surely courts should avoid this tragedy today and apply Jacobson 's fairness and reasonable test, and rule on the statutory due pro cess violations with intermediate, if not heightened scrutiny . II. The Equities Weigh In Favor Of Injunctive Relief Applicant s seeking an \"injunction while an appeal is pending\" before this Court, must satisfy the traditional standard for injunctive relief: (1) likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable injury absent an injunction; (3) balance of the hardship tips in the Applicant s' favor; and (4) the public interest would not be disserved by the issuance of an injunction. Benihana, Inc. v. Benihana of Tokyo, LLC , 784 F.3d 887, 895 (2d Cir. 2015) . A. Likelihood of Success Applicant is likely to prevail as a matter of law. The Vaccination Orders are void ab initio in that they violate the Separation of Powers and Informed Consent Doctrines, which preempt adult vaccination mandates in NYS. The Vaccination Orders violate Applicant 's due process rights to the statutory protections of the state and federal laws that pro tect municipal worker's due process rights to refuse informed consent . The Vaccination Orders are arbitrary 40 and capricious because they are both overinclusive and underinclusive, and moreover, the emergency is over. BST Holdings, L.L.C. v. OSHA , , No. 21A244 (Jan. 13, 2022). \"It is the province of the people's elected representatives, rather than appointed administrators, to resolve difficult social problems by making choices among competing ends\" N.Y. Statewide Coal. of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce v DOMHH , 23 N.Y.3d at 696-97. The NY legislature can and has spoken and in January of 2021, chose not to mandate a Covid 19 vaccination while approving measures to conduct contract tracing. See PHL \u00a72180 -2182, (1-3). B. Irreparable Harm Your Applicant is seeking a Stay pending a de novo review of the dismissal of his lawsuit in the Second Circuit , and to reverse the District Court's Judgment granting removal from state Court, and dissolving the State Court TRO, as an abuse of discretion. Applicant sought an Emergency Stay \\Preliminary Inj unction in the Second Circuit that was denied causing the Applicant, and all others similarly situated, irreparable harm, depriving City employees of their due process rights to refuse an EUA Covid 19 adult vaccination or be terminated from employment. \"Th e deprivation of constitutional rights, such as due process, causes irreparable harm. Covino v. Petrissa , 967 F.2d 73 at 77, (2d Cir. 1992) Mitchell v. Cuomo , 748 F.2d 804, 806 (2d Cir. 1984) .\" York , 04 Civ. 8255 (WHP), at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Sep. 30, 2005) . In dissolving the State Court TRO, the District Court found there was no irreparable harm to the Applicant because he was still working pending a review of his religious exemption to excuse him from the employee mandate. The District Court discounted the fact that although the 41 Applicant was still working, his religious exemption was likely going to be denied, and was denied as expected. On about March 1, 2022, Applicant filed an appeal of the denial of his religious exemption, which is still pending with the Law Department, and will likely be denied along with nearly every other exemption request and appeal, g iven that the City has denied 99% of all religious and medical exemptions for municipal workers to the EUA Covid 19 vaccination thus far. The Second Circuit in denying the Stay overlooked the Vaccination Orders are void ab initio violating the due process rights of thousands of other municipal employees, similarly, situated to Detective Marciano, who have already been terminated or are facing imminent termination causing them irreparable harm. In Elrod v Burns, U.S. Supreme Court noted in upholding the gr anting injunctive relief, \"[a]t the time a preliminary injunction was sought in the District Court, one of the respondents was only threatened with discharge.\" 427 U.S. 347 (1976) . The District Court reasoned that any harm endured by Applicant could be remedied by a Monell claim as a source for monetary damages. (A -275). See Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York , 436 U.S. 658 (1978) . The District Court overlooked the sweeping no -fault liability protections giving City complete immunity from suit with respect to any claims for losses arising out of a ny Covid 19 covered countermeasure. The PREP Act provides for no damages awards, outside of the illusory Countermeasure Injury Compensation Program (CICP), entitlement prog ram, which only rarely will cover medical costs not covered by the vaccinee's health insurance, if at all. Parker v. St. Lawrence Cnty. Pub. Health Dep't, 102 A.D.3d 140 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012). 42 The District Court stated during oral argument, \"In Monell , which, for the benefit of the record, a 1978 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Supreme Court held, as a matter of constitutional la w, that if a state agent acting in their official capacity violated the federal Constitution, an action for damages would lie. I don't see how that can be possibly affected by what you are referring to...\" (A - 275). Any Monel claim filed by Applicant would b e dismissed pursuant to 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1) as fast as it was filed under the no -fault, no -liability protections of the PREP Act preempting all damages for Covid 19 EUA Countermeasures. Under the PREP Act, the waiver of liability for any Countermeasure use is premised upon implied informed consent to the submit to the EUA Countermeasure voluntarily. (A -276 to A-277). The Second Circuit has defined irreparable harm \"as certain and imminent harm for which a monetary award does not adequately compensate.\" Wisdom Imp . Sales Co ., LLC v. Labatt Brewing Co ., Ltd., 339 F.3d 101, 113 (2d Cir. 2003) (citations omitted); see also Tom Doherty Assocs ., Inc. v. Saban Entm't , Inc., 60 F.3d 27, 37 (2d Cir. 1995) (stating that \"[i]rreparable harm is an injury that is not remote or speculative but actual and imminent, and 'for which a monetary award cannot be adequate compensation'\"(quoting Jackson Dairy , 596 F.2d at 72)). Doe v. Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst., 1:18-CV-1374 (FJS/CFH), at *4 (N.D .N.Y. Jan. 11, 2019). Applicant is refusing informed consent and has no legal remedy. Applicant is facing either loss of his job or receiving a dangerous and illegally mandated EUA Covid 19 Countermeasure vaccine under duress, which he does not need, nor want, because among other things, in NYS, adult mandates are illegal as a matter of state law, and he has natural immunity . See PH L \u00a7206(1)(l) , PHL \u00a7613 , also see Garcia v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene, 31 N.Y.3d 601 (2018). 43 More importantly, this endless abuse of power by the City's Respondents is likely to continue and repeat with more mandates, more emergencies, more drugs, more vaccines, more medical devices, and other bold, unprecedented restrictions and mandates, in a se a of executive and regulatory abuses by an overactive NYC Board of Health. \"The separation of powers doctrine of the State Constitution establishes the boundaries between actions of the legislature and an administrative agency. Because the constitution ve sts legislative power in the legislature, administrative agencies may only effect policy mandated by statute and cannot exercise sweeping power to create whatever rule they deem necessary. In other words, '[as] an arm of the executive branch of government, an administrative agency may not, in the exercise of rule - making authority, engage in broad -based public policy determinations'\". Rent Stabilization Assn. of N.Y. City v. Higgins, 83 N.Y.2d 156, 169, (1993 ), cert. denied 512 U.S. 1213 (1993 ), citing Boreali, 71 N.Y.2d at 9. A majority of this Court would likely agree that to avoid continuing irreparable harm, the State Court TRO should be reinstated, the City Respondents should be preliminarily enjoined, and the Vaccination Orders, ultimately, struck down in the Second Circuit upon conclu sion of the Appeal process . Balance of the Equities & Public Interest The balance of the equity's tips in Applicant 's favor and requires this Court to find \"that the harm to the plaintiff without the injunction will be greater than the harm to the defendant if the injunction is granted. Nassau Roofing & Sheet Metal Co. v Facilities Devp't Corp ., 70 A.D.2d 1021 (3d Dept. 1979) . Where there is \"no evidence to suggest [Respondent] will be harmed in the interim\" and the first two prongs of the standard have been satisfied, a preliminary injunction is properly granted. Park Briar Assoc. v Park Briar Owners, Inc., 182 A.D.2d 685, 44 687 (2d Dept. 1992) . The status quo to be preserved here is period before the vaccine orders went into effect in October of 2021, not after. It is well -settled that there is no public interest in preserving an unconstitutional governmental order. See, e.g ., Gordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013) . CONCLUSION For the reasons stated above , Detective Marciano respectfully requests for this Honorable Court to reinstate the State Court Stay, pending the outcome of Applicant's Appeal in the Second Circuit.

In the two years since the first confirmed COVID -19 case in New York City was reported on March 1, 2020, the virus has inflicted death and disruption upon the City on a scale unparalleled in recent memory.1 Seeking to control and mitigate the virus's impact, the New York City Board of Health has put into place various measures. Among these measures was an order, first issued by the Commissioner of the City's Department of Health and 1 According to the most recent data, at least 39,903 individuals have died of COVID-19 in New York City. See \"Trends and Totals,\" NYC Health, https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid -19-data- totals.page (last accessed 7, 2022). ANTHONY MARCIANO, Plaintiff, -against- BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK, in his official capacity, DAVE A. CHOCKSHI, COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE, in his official capacity, DERMOT SHEA, POLICE COMMISSIONER, in his official capacity, THE NEW YORK CITY BOARD OF HEALTH, and THE CITY OF NEW YORK, Defendants. Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e2 Poaf g2e8 2 of 28 2 App. 5 Mental Hygiene on October 20, 2021, requiring all City employees and certain contractors to be vaccinated against COVID -19. Plaintiff Anthony Marciano, a detective with the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\"), commenced this action in New York State Supreme Court, from which it was subsequently removed to this Court, challenging the Commissioner's October 20, 2021 order as facially invalid under state law and as violating his federal constitutional rig ht to substantive and procedural due process. Listed as defendants in this action were Bill de Blasio, in his (former) official capacity as Mayor of the City of New York, Dave A Chokshi, in his official capacity as Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, Dermot Shea, in his (former) official capacity as Police Commissioner, the New York City Board of Health, and the City of New York.2 Defendants have now moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) for lack of standing and failure to state a claim, respectively. See ECF No. 2 As of the date of this Memorandum Opinion, Eric Adams is Mayor of the City of New York and Keechant Sewell is the New York City Police Commissioner. When a government official is sued in an official capacity and subsequently leaves office, the official's successor is automatically substituted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). Were this case to continue beyond the motions disposed of here, it would be appropriate to substitute -in the successors of the named government officials. Marciano's complaint also misspells Commissioner Chokshi's name as \"Dave A. Chockshi,\" which it would similarly be appropriate to correct were the case to move forward. Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e3 Poaf g2e8 3 of 28 3 App. 6 27. For the reasons set forth below, the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is denied, the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is granted, and the complaint is dismissed with prejudice. BACKGROUND A. Factual Background The New York City Board of Health (the \"Board\") is part of the City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the \"Department\") and consists of the Commissioner of that Department, the Chairperson of the Department's Mental Hygiene Advisory Board, and nine other members, appointed by the Mayor. See New York City Charter (\"Charter\") \u00a7 553. On March 25, 2020, David Chokshi, the Department's Commissioner, declared a public health emergency within New York City to address the threat posed by COVID -19 to the health and welfare of City residents. See ECF 28-1 (\"Order\") at 2. That order remains in effect. Id. The Commissioner's declaration followed Mayor De Blasio's issuance of Emergency Executi ve Order No. 98, which similarly declared a state of emergency in the City to address the threat posed by the pandemic to the City residents \u2014 and that executive order also remains in effect. Id. A week after Commissioner Chokshi's declaration, the first wave of the pandemic hit its peak within the City, with approximately 1,850 daily hospitalizations reported on March 30, 2020. ECF of 28 4 App. 4 In late 2020, the first COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 developed by Pfizer and BioNTech \u2014 was granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). See ECF 1-1 (\"Complaint\") \u00b6 126. Subsequently, on August 23, 2021, the FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine for individuals 16 years of age and older.3 In a press release announcing the vaccine's approval, the FDA stated that the vaccine had proven \"91% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease\" in clinical trials.4 The following week, Mayor de Blasio issued Executive Order No. 78, requiring that, beginning September 13, 2021, City employees and covered City contractors either be vaccinated against COVID-19 or be tested for COVID-19 on a weekly basis. See Order at 3. Pursuant to his prior declaration of a public health emergency, Commissioner Chokshi, on October 20, 2021, issued an order (the \"Department's Order\" or the \"Order\") requiring COVID- 19 vaccinations for City employees and certain City contractors. See id. In setting out the justification for the Order, Commissioner Chokshi noted, among other things, that, that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventi on (\"CDC\") \"has stated that vaccination is an effective tool to prevent the spread of 3 See \"FDA Approves First COVID-19 Vaccine\" (Aug. 23, 2021), Poaf g2e5 of 28 5 App. 5 COVID-19 and the development of new variants, and benefits both vaccine recipients and those they come into contact with, including persons who for reasons of age, health, or other conditions cannot themselves be vaccinated.\" Id. at 2. He also noted that, according to one study, \"the Department's vaccination campaign was estimated to have prevented about 250,000 COVID-19 cases, 44,000 hospitalizations, and 8,300 deaths from COVID -19 infection since the start of vaccination through July 1, 2021,\" and that \"the number of prevented cases, hospitalizations, and death has risen since then.\" Id. The Board ratified the Department's Order by a unanimous vote on November 1, 2021. ECF No. 28 -2 at 22. The Order set a deadline of 5:00 p.m. on October 29, 2021 by which time City employees \"must provide proof to the agency or office where they work that either (1) they have been fully vaccinated against COVID -19; or (2) they have received a single dose COVID -19 vaccine, even if two weeks have not passed since they received the vaccine; or (3) they have received the first dose of a two -dose COVID -19 vaccine.\" See id. at 5. Further, under the Order, any City employee who has not provided the above- described proof must be excluded from their assigned work location beginning on November 1, 2021. See id. at 4. The Order specifically states that it shall not \"be construed to prohibit any reasonable accommodations otherwise required by law.\" Id. at 6. Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e6 Poaf g2e6 of 28 6 App. 6 After the Order was issued, the City published a set of Frequently Asked Questions (\"FAQs\") to clarify the application of the vaccine mandate.5 The FAQs state that, \"[b]eginning November 1, [2021,] City staff who are not in compliance with the vaccine mandate and have not applied for a reasonable accommodation will be placed on Leave Without Pay\" (\"LWOP\"). Id. The FAQs further explain that an employee may be immediately \"removed from LWOP\" and restored to payroll if he or she arrives at work with proof of one dose of a vaccine; however, \"[e]mployees who refuse to comply will be terminated in accordance with procedures required by the Civil Service Law or applicable collective bargaining agreement.\" Id. Subsequently, the NYPD issued an Administrative Bulletin advising members of the police force of the Order and its requirements. See ECF No. 20 -3. Then, on November 10, 2021, Police Commissioner Shea issued Operations Order 49, which incorporated the requirements of both Mayor de Blasio's August 31, 2021 Executive Order and the Department's Order, including the requirement that NYPD employees who are not in compliance with 5 \"FAQ on New York City Employees Vaccine Mandate,\" https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dcas/downloads/pdf/guidelines/faq - vaccine-mandate.pdf (last accessed February 22, 2022). The Court may take judicial notice of these state agency-promulgated guidelines in deciding the motion to dismiss. See T.P. ex rel. Patterson v. Elmsford Union Free Sch. Dist., 2012 WL 860367, at *4 Poaf g2e7 of 28 7 App. 7 these order would be placed on LWOP. See ECF No. 20-4. The order also sets out a process by which NYPD employees may seek a reasonable accommodation to be exempted from the Department's Order and provides that any member of the service with a pending application may continue to report to duty so long as he or she undergoes weekly COVID -19 testing. Id. at 2. Plaintiff Anthony Marciano is a detective with the NYPD. See Complaint \u00b6 44; ECF 31-1 \u00b6 1. Marciano has served as a member of the City's police force through the pandemic, including after contracting and recovering from COVID -19 in March of 2020. See Complaint \u00b6 91. Following the issuance of Police Commissioner Shea's order, Plaintiff Marciano ap plied for an accommodation exempting him from the Department's Order, citing religious objections. See ECF 8-1 at 24. In accordance with the NYPD's procedures, he was not put on LWOP pending a decision on his accommodation request. See ECF 8-1 at 24. On February 8, 2022, Marciano was notified that his accommodation request was denied, and he was given seven days to appeal the decision before it was put into effect. ECF No. 30 -6. Marciano timely proceeded with such an appeal on February 11, 2021, and, as a result, he remains on active duty pending a final decision regarding his accommodation request. ECF No. 32 at 2. Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e8 Poaf g2e8 of 28 8 8 B. Procedural Background On December 6, 2021, Marciano commenced this action in New York State Supreme Court by filing a complaint6 on behalf of himself and \"others similarly situated\" against the defendants challenging the vaccine mandate imposed by the Department's Order and seeking a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") preventing the implementation of the mandate as well as a declaration that the Order is void. Complaint at 2. The complaint asserts four claims: (1) \"separation of powers\" under the New York State Constitution, id. \u00b6\u00b6 235-40; (2) preemption by state law, \u00b6\u00b6 241 -44; (3) substantive due process, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, id. \u00b6\u00b6 245-49; and (4) procedural due process, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, id. \u00b6\u00b6 250-53. On December 14, 2021, both parties appeared before the Honorable Justice Nervo of the New York State Supreme Court for oral argument concerning Marciano's TRO application. At the conclusion of oral argument, Justice Nervo issued an oral decision from the bench granting the TRO. See ECF No. 20 -5 at 48. The next day, on December 15, 2021, defendants timely removed the 6 Although stylized as a hybrid complaint and Article 78 petition, nevertheless, because the complaint exclusively sought to challenge the Order on facial grounds, it was an Article 78 petition in name only. See Corbett v. City of New York, 816 Fed. App'x 551 (2020) (An Article 78 court \"may not rule on [a regulation's] facial g2e9 of 28 9 App. 9 action to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1443 based on Marciano's federal claims, viz., his third and fourth claims alleging substantive and procedural due process violations, respectively. See ECF No. 5. Subsequently, on December 23, 2021, Marciano filed an emergency motion seeking that his state law claims be severed and remanded to the state court. ECF No. 17. On December 27, 2021, defendants filed a motion to vacate the TRO issued by the New York State Supreme Court. ECF No. 18. On December 29, 2021, the parties appeared remotely before this Court for oral argument on Marciano's motion to remand the state law claims to the state court and defendants' motion to vacate the TRO. First, the Court denied Marciano's motion to sever and remand his state law claims. ECF No. 24 at 16. Next, noting that Marciano's reasonable accommodation request was still pending and, as a result, he was continuing to be paid his salary and work in his position, the Court granted defendants' motion, vacating the TRO, although without prejudice to plaintiff bringing a renewed application for a TRO if his circumstances changed. ECF No. 24 at 28. The Court then set a briefing schedule with respect to defendants' motion to dism iss Marciano's complaint.7 7 Subsequently, on January 13, 2022, Justice Nervo issued a Decision and Order in which he concluded that, notwithstanding defendants' removal of the matter to this Court, the state court retained jurisdiction \u2014 at least insofar as a federal court had not yet granted the motion to remove \u2014 and denied Marc iano's complaint on the merits. See ECF 28-8. Because was Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e10Paogf e2810 of 28 10 App. 13 On February 8, Marciano filed a renewed TRO motion, citing the City's denial of his request for reasonable accommodation. ECF No. 30-1. Oral argument on defendants' motion to dismiss and Marciano's renewed TRO motion was held before this Court on February 28, 2022. At the hearing, the Court denied Marciano's renewed TRO motion, citing, among other reasons, that Marciano remains on active duty while his appeal of the denial of his accommodation request is pending. See Transcript of February 28, 2022 Hea ring. LEGAL STANDARD To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must provide grounds upon which his claim rests through \"factual allegations sufficient 'to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.'\" ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).8 To do so, the complaint must allege \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" Starr v. Sony BMG Music Entm't, 592 F.3d 314, 321 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). \"A claim has facial issued after defendants' notice of removal was filed, it is void and without effect. See N.Y. State Nat'l Org. for Women v. Terry, 697 F. Supp. 1324, 1330 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. v. Silberglitt , 441 F.2d 225, 227 (2d Cir. 1971)). 8 Unless otherwise indicated, in quoting cases all internal quotation marks, alterations, emphases, footnotes, and citations are omitted. Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e11Paogf e2811 of 28 11 App. 14 plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). In applying this standard, the Court accepts as true all well -pled factual allegations but does not credit \"mere conclusory statemen ts\" or \"[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action.\" Id. In deciding a motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), \"the Court may consider documents that are referenced in the complaint, documents that the plaintiff relied on in bringing suit and tha t are either in the plaintiff's possession or that the plaintiff knew of when bringing suit, or matters of which judicial notice may be taken.\" Jovani Fashion, Ltd. v. Cinderella Divine, Inc. , 808 F. Supp. 2d 542, 545 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (citing Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 153 (2d Cir.2002)), aff'd, 500 F. App'x 42 (2d Cir. 2012). In resolving a challenge to standing under Rule 12(b)(1), \"the Court may consider extrinsic evidence proffered by the parties in addition to facts alleged in the pleadings.\" Bekker v. Neuberger Berman Grp. LLC, 2018 WL 4636841, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2018). DISCUSSION Defendants move to dismiss Marciano's complaint both for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), and for lack of standing, pursuant to Rule defendants' Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e12Paogf 28 12 App. 15 challenge to standing implicates whether the Court has the subject matter jurisdiction necessary to consider the merits of the action, see Rhulen Agency, Inc. v. Ala. first addresses Marciano's standing to pursue this action. I. Standing To satisfy the \"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing . . . the plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judi cial decision.\" Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins , 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016). Defendants' arguments concern the first of these three elements \u2014 injury in fact. An injury in fact is \"an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\" Id. at 339. Because Marciano has not yet actually been put on LWOP or terminated pending the resolution of his appeal of the denial of his request for accommodation, defendants argue that he faces at most a hypothetical harm, insufficient to give rise to standing. The Court disagrees. Satisfying the injury-in-fact requirement is \"a low threshold which helps to ensure that the plaintiff has a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.\" John v. Whole Foods Mkt. Grp., Inc., 858 F.3d 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e13Paogf e13 of 28 13 App. 13 injury in the future is sufficient to satisfy standing so long as the injury is \"certainly impending[] or there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur.\" Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus , 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014). Although it is true that Marciano's departmental appeal is still pending and, as a result, he has neither been placed on LWOP or terminated, defendants have not offered any reason to conclude that an ultimate denial of his accommodation request is anything but very likely. Indeed, the evidence submitted by Marciano, including an internal guidance document for reviewing accommodation requests and a sworn affidavit from the executive director of the NYPD's Equal Employment Opportunity Division, see ECF Nos. 31-15, 31-25, strongly suggests that his accommodation request \u2014 based on purported objections to fetal cell derivative research \u2014 will ultimately be denied. Accordingly, the Court denies the motion to dismiss for lack of standing and proceed to the merits.9 9 The Court's determination that Marciano has standing to proceed with this suit is not inconsistent with its prior holding that Marciano failed to establish a sufficiently immediate harm to justify a TRO. \"[E]stablishing that there is a substantial threat of irreparable injury on a motion for preliminary injunction is a much taller task than showing injury -in-fact to survive a motion to dismiss.\" Gbalazeh v. City of Dallas, 394 F. Supp. 3d 666, 672 (N.D. Tex. 2019); see also Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp., 822 F.3d 1011, 1022 (9th Cir. 2016) (\"A plaintiff must do more than merely allege imminent harm sufficient to establish standing; a plaintiff must demonstrate immediate threatened injury as a prerequisite to preliminary injunctive relief.\"). While the allegations and Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e14Paogf e14 of 28 14 App. 17 II. Ultra Vires Marciano's first cause of action seeks a declaration that the Department's Order is facially invalid as an ultra vires act under the New York State Constitution. However, as recent case law has made clear, the Commissioner and the Board's authority to issue the sort of vaccination requirement at issue here is firmly established. In particular, the Board's authority to mandate vaccinations was confirmed by the Court of Appeals of New York in its decision in Garcia v. New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene, 31 N.Y.3d 601 (2018). As the court explained in that case, the New York City Charter, as enacted by the state legislature, \"empowers the Department with 'jurisdiction to regulate all matters affecting health in the city of New York and to perform all those functions and operations performed by the city that relate to the health of the people of the city,'\" including in matters relating to the \"control of communicable and chronic limited evidence proffered by the parties in connect ion to the 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss suggest a sufficiently likely injury so as to ensure Marciano has a \"personal stake in the outcome of the controversy,\" Whole Foods , 853 F.3d at 767, that Marciano's pay continues for the time being has provided the Court sufficient opportunity to reach a decision on the merits before any harm is actually suffered, obviating the need for a TRO, see Citibank N.A. v. Citytrust , 756 F.2d 273, 275 (2d Cir. 1985) (\"[T]he single most important prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction is a demonstration that, if not granted, the applicant is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a decision on the merits can be rendered.\"). Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e15Paogf e15 of 28 15 App. 18 disease and conditions hazardous to life and health.\" Id. at 610 (quoting Charter \u00a7 556). Consistent with this broad grant of jurisdiction, Section 17- 109 of the New York City Administrative Code \"delegates to the Department \u2014 and by extension, the Board \u2014 the power 'to collect and preserve pure vaccine lymph or virus, produce diphtheria antitoxin and other vaccines and antitox ins, and add necessary additional provisions to the health code in order to most effectively prevent the spread of communicable diseases'\" and \"to take measures . . . for general and gratuitous vaccinations.\" Id. at 610-11 (quoting New York City Admin. Code \u00a7 17 -109(a), (b)). Concluding that these provisions constituted a \"legislative delegation of authority\" sufficient to enable the Board \"to adopt vaccination measures,\" the Court of Appeals upheld the Board's rule mandating influenza vaccines for children attending city - regulated childcare or school -based programs. Id. at 611. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that \"the flu vaccine rules necessarily impinge upon personal choice to some degree,\" but explained that \"the rules challenged here do not relate merely to a personal choice about an individual's own health but, rather, seek to ensure increased public safety and health for the citizenry by reducing the prevalence and spread of a contagious infectious disease.\" Id. at 612. Accordingly, there was a \"very direct between the Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e16Paogf e16 of 28 16 App. 19 flu vaccine rules and the preservation of health and safety,\" placing the vaccine measures in question clearly within the Board's purview. Id. at 612. The same can be said about Board's requirement that City employees and contractors be vaccinated against COVID -19. As Commissioner Chokshi explained in promulgating the Order, \"a system of vaccination for individuals providing City services and working in City offices will potentially save lives, protect public health, and promote public safety,\" both because vaccination protects the City employees and contractors themselves from serious illness and death and because it reduces the risk that those employees and contractors will transmit the disease to those members of the public they serve. ECF 28-1 at 2. Indeed, it is not hard to see how that rationale applies with full force to the city's police department, Marciano included: The NYPD's officers regularly interact with the public, whom they have sworn to protect, often in emergency situations where close contact is unavoidable. It is incumbent on the City to take steps that mitigate the health risks such interactions with the police pose to its residents, thus reinforcing the public trust on which effectiv e policing relies. In Garcia, the Court of Appeals explained that the Board's authority to require vaccination was further supported by \"the Board's long history of mandating immunizations for children Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e17Paogf e17 of 28 17 App. 17 attending City-regulated child care programs beyond those required by the [state] legislature\" \u2014 a history beginning no later than 1866, when the Board, in a predecessor form, mandated smallpox vaccinations for minors. 31 N.Y.3d at 613 -14. Notably, the Board's deep history of such actions similarly supports its authority to impose vaccination as a condition of employment for those in service of the City. As the Court of Appeals recognized when upholding the constitutionality of the Board's predecessor over a century and a half ago, the City's health officials have long been endowed with immense control \"over persons and property, so far as the public health was concerned,\" including the authority \"to regulate, abate or remove all trades or manufactures that might be by them deemed injurious to the public health.\" Metropolitan Bd. of Health v. Heister , 37 N.Y. 661, 670 (1868); see also John Fabian Witt, American Contagions: Epidemics and the Law from Smallpox to COVID -19 24-26 (2020) (discussing the Metropolitan Board of Health). Regulation of those the City employs or with whom it contracts to work within its limits through the imposition of a vaccine requirement would certainly seem to fall within that broad mandate. Cf. Viemeister v. White, 179 N.Y. 235, 240 (1904) (noting that vaccination against smallpox is a requirement to serve \"in nearly all the armies and navies of the world\"). In any case, although the decision in Garcia only explicitly addressed mandated vaccinations for children, the Appellate Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e18Paogf e18 of 28 18 App. 18 Division recently extended that prior holding to adult vaccinations in C.F. v. New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene, 191 A.D.3d 52, 64-65 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d Dep't 2020). In its decision issued on December 23, 2020, approximately nine months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the court upheld the Board's adoption of a mandatory vaccination requirement \u2014 applicable to all persons \"older than six months of age who lived or worked within four specified zip codes\" \u2014 arising out of a severe measles outbreak in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Id. at 57, 69. The court's decision also upheld the Commissioner's authority to promulgate such a vaccination order pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the New York City Health Code, which provides, in relevant part, that upon the declaration of a public health emergency, the Department's Commissioner may . . . issue necessary orders and take such actions as may be necessary for the health or the safety of the City and its residents,\" provided that any such orders \"shall be effective only until the next meeting of the Board,\" where \"the Board may continue or rescind\" those orders. See C.F., 191 A.D.3d at 57 - 58, 67. In its opinion in C.F., the Appellate Division made clear that it understood itself to be deciding \"whether the Board of Health, as a means of controlling a contagion that has already spread, may mandate the vaccination of all persons who live or work, and children who attend school, within the affected area.\" Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e19Paogf e19 of 28 19 App. 19 Id. at 62. In so doing, the court explained that it was \"very much aware of the COVID -19 pandemic[,] which has caused so much death, severe illness, and economic dislocation in our state and nation,\" as well as \"the concerns expressed as to the willingness of the public to accept the vaccine voluntarily,\" potentially necessitating \"the public health authorities to mandate the administration of a vaccine.\" Id. The court, in other words, presciently anticipated a case not unlike the present one challenging th e authority of the Commissioner and the Board to require vaccination for COVID -19 and laid down a rule plainly deciding the issue in favor of sustaining such an order. Thus, to the extent the Court of Appeals, in Garcia, left open any question as to the Commissioner's authority to issue a vaccine requirement applicable to adults to address a public health emergency, no ambiguity persists following the decision in C.F. See V.S. v. Muhammad , 595 F.3d 426, 432 (2d Cir. 2010) (a federal court \"is bound to app ly the law as interpreted by a state's intermediate appellate courts unless there is persuasive evidence that the state's highest court would reach a different conclusion\"). Nevertheless, Marciano seeks to distinguish the decision in C.F. from the present case, pointing to various differences between the Department's Order pertaining to COVID -19 and the measles - related order at issue in C.F., including that the Board's measles order provided an exception for people who could demonstrate they Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e20Paogf e20 of 28 20 App. 20 \"already had immunity to the disease,\" an exception the Order at issue here lacks. 191 A.D.3d at 58. But, as the Court of Appeals explained in Garcia, it is not for the courts to \"determin[e] whether a regulatory agency adopted the most desirable method or type of regulation.\" 31 N.Y.3d at 616. Rather, once a court has concluded that \"the agency has been empowered to regulate the matter in question, the separation of powers analysis goes no farther in reviewing the agency's methods.\" Id. (citing Boreali v. Axelrod, 71 N.Y.2d 1 (1987)). Accordingly, having concluded that the authority to require vaccination for City employees and contractors falls clearly within the Board's regulatory purview, The Court grants defendants' motion to dismiss count one of the complaint, which seeks a declaration that the Order is ultra vires under the New York State Constitution. III. Preemption Marciano's second cause of action assets that the Department's Order is invalid as preempted by state law. Specifically, he argues that the Order is preempted by New York's Public Health Law, which h e characterizes as \"explicitly limit[ing] the commissioner's authority to 'children' and 'post-secondary students.'\" ECF No. 31 at 25. In support of this position, Marciano points to Section 206(1)(l) of the law, which states, in relevant part, that Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e21Paogf e21 of 28 21 App. 21 \"[n]othing in this paragraph shall authorize mandatory immunizations of adults or children, except as provided in [Public Health Law \u00a7\u00a7 2164 and 2165, mandating vaccination of children].\" But, as the Court of Appeals explained in Garcia, these statutory provisions are directed to the powers and duties of the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health and in no way limit the New York City Department or its Commissioner from issuing separate and independent vaccine requirements. See Garcia, 31 N.Y.3d at 620. Indeed, in C.F., the Appellate Division explicitly rejected the argument that the state Public Health Law preempted the City Commissioner's authority to issue a vaccine mandate applicable to adults. See C.F., 191 A.D.3d at 67.10 Accordingly, the Order is not preempted by state law, and Marciano's second cause of action is dismissed. IV. Substantive Due Process Marciano's third cause of action alleges that the Department's Order violates his \"right to bodily integrity,\" constituting a denial of substantive due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. ECF No. 31 at 33. Such a substantive 10 Marciano also suggests that New York State Department of Labor will likely adopt a rule mandating a mask and test requirement that will preempt the Department's Order. But this Court knows of no authority allowing a federal court to invalidate a duly issued order on such speculative grounds, and Marciano offers none. Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e22Paogf e22 of 28 22 App. 22 due process claim, however, is foreclosed by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Jacobson v. Massachusetts , 197 U.S. 11 (1905). At issue in that case was a regulation, promulgated in the midst of an epidemic by the board of health of the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts pursuant to a state statute, mandating that all inhabitants of the city of Cambridge be vaccinated against smallpox or face criminal penalty in the form of a fine. Id. at 12. The plaintiff argued that the statute violated his \"inherent right\" to \"care for his own body and health in such a way as to him seems best.\" Id. at 26. But the Court rejected that argument, explaining that \"[t]he possession and enjoyment of all rights are subject to such reasonable conditions as may be deemed by the governing authority of the country essential to the safety, health, peace, good order, and morals of the community.\" Id. Accordingly, the Court upheld the vaccine requirement, concluding that a court must not invalidate a law or regulation \"enacted to protect the public health\" so long as it has \"real or substantial relation [to public health]\" and is not \"beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.\" Id. at 31. Although decided over a century ago, Jacobson remains good law. As the Second Circuit recently stated in declining to enjoin a COVID-19 vaccination requirement similar to the one at issue here, \"[b]oth [the Second Circuit] and the Supreme Court have consistently recognized that the Constitution embodies no Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e23Paogf e23 of 28 23 App. 23 fundamental right that in and of itself would render vaccine requirements imposed in the public interest, in the face of a public health emergency, unconstitutional.\" We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul, 17 F.4th 266, 293 (2d Cir. 2021) (citing Jacobson , 197 U.S. at 25-31 and Phillips v. City of New York, 775 F.3d 538, 542 (2d Cir. 2015)). As such, a requirement that City employees and contractors receive a vaccine approved by the FDA, implemented in the throes of a pandemic to help stem the unremitting waves of illness within the City, does not facially violate any right to substantive due process. In the face of this precedent, Marciano concedes that it is within the power of the state to enact a compulsory vaccination law like the one at issue here. Nevertheless, he argues that while Jacobson upholds a state's authority to require vaccination, it does not similarly authorize Commissioner Chokshi, \"a municipal health commissioner\" who is not \"accountable to the people,\" to exercise such power. ECF No. 31 at 34. But this assertion has no basis in the law. Indeed, in Jacobson itself the vaccine mandate upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court had been issued by local health authorities - not the state legislature. See 197 U.S. at 12 -13. More broadly, a state's delegation of its police power to an administrator is not subject to review as a matter of federal constitutional law. See Sweezy v. State of N.H. by Wyman, 354 U.S. 234, 255 (1957) (\"[T]his Court has held that the concept of Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e24Paogf e24 of 28 24 App. 24 separation of powers embodied in the United States Constitution is not mandatory in state governments.\"). Accordingly, courts in this Circuit have uniformly recognized the validity of vaccine requirements imposed by the City and the Board when challenged on substantive due process grounds. See Maniscalco v. New York City Dep't of Educ. 4344267, at (denying motion to preliminary enjoin COVID -19 vaccination requirement for New York City Department of Education employees for failure to show likelihood of success on the merits), aff'd, 2021 WL 4814767 (2d Cir. Oct. 15, of New York, 2022 WL 347632, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2022) (denying motion to preliminary enjoin requirement that all City employees and covered contractors either be vaccinated or take weekly test for COVID-19 for failure to show likelihood of success on the merits). For these reasons, the Court dismisses Marciano's third cause of action. V. Procedural Due Process Marciano fourth cause of action asserts a procedural due process claim based on the threatened loss of pay and employment he faces for failure to meet the Order's vaccine requirement. \"A procedural due process claim requires the plaintiff to establish (1) possession by the plaintiff of a protected liberty or property interest, and (2) deprivation of that interest without Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e25Paogf e25 of Tooly v. Schwaller , 919 F.3d 165, 173 (2d Cir. 2019). As a public employee subject to discharge only for cause, Marciano has a constitutionally protected interest in his continued employment. See O'Connor v. Pierson, 426 F.3d 187, 196 (2d Cir. 2005); see also O'Neill v. City of Auburn , 23 F.3d 685, 688 (2d Cir. 1994) (\"[The New York Civil Service Law] gives covered employees a property interest in their employment, so that they may not be terminated without notice and hearing.\"); Capul v. City of New York, 2020 WL 2748274, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 27, 2020) (holding that the New York Civil Service Law covers NYPD employees), aff'd, 832 F. App'x 766 (2d Cir. 2021). Accordingly, the question of whether Marciano's constitutional rights have been violated depends on what process he has or will be provided i n connection with his threatened relegation to LWOP and termination and whether that process is constitutionally adequate. Marciano argues that his procedural due process rights were violated because the NYPD has failed to adhere to the disciplinary procedures set forth in section 14 -115 of the New York City Administrative Code and the NYPD Patrol Guide in enforcing the vaccine requirement. As an initial matter, it does not appear that Marciano is entitled to these protections as a matter of state or city law. Marciano has failed to satisfy a condition of his employment, that is, that he be vaccinated against COVID -19, and Case 1:C21a-scev-2120-755720-,JDSoRc-uBmCeMnt 2D, o0c3u/1m7e/2n0t 2326, 3F2i8le1d20431/,0P8a/2g2e26Paogf e26 of 28 26 App. 26 \"the termination of a public employee based on the employee's failure to satisfy a qualification of employment unrelated to job performance, misconduct, or competency does not implicate the [Administrative Code's or the Patrol Guide's] disciplinary procedures.\" Garland v. City Fire WL at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 2022) (\"Recent case law from this Circuit and in the State of New York supports a finding that vaccination is a lawful condition of employment.\") More importantly, Marciano's arguments are beside the point. The question for the Court is not whether state procedural law was correctly followed or applied, but rather whether the process provided satisfies constitutional requirements. And to determine whether process is adequate, the Court looks to \"[f]ederal constitutional standards rather than state statutes.\" Robison v. Via, 821 F.2d 913, 923 (2d Cir. see also Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill , 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985) (\"[O]nce it is determined that the Due Process Clause applies, the question remains what process is due . . . . The answer to that question is not to be found in the [state] statute.\"); Russell v. Coughlin (2d Cir. 1990) (\"[T]he fact that the State may have specified its own procedures that it may deem adequate for determining the preconditions to adverse official action 28 27 App. 27 does not settle what protection the federal due process clause requires.\"). In order to satisfy the constitutional minimum, the predeprivation proceedings \"need not be elaborate.\" O'Connor , 426 F.3d at 198 (quoting Loudermill , 470 U.S. at 545). \"[T]he Constitution mandates only that such a process include, at a minimum, notice and opportunity to respond.\" Id. As defendants argue, Marciano received multiple forms of notice regarding the Department's Order more than a month before the deadline to comply or to seek an accommodation, including through an Administrative Bulletin sent to members of the police force and through an order issued by Police Commissioner Shea. See ECF Nos. 20-3, 20-4. Further, as reflected in Commissioner Shea's order, Marciano was given the opportunity to be heard as to the application of the Order against him by seeking an accommodation through the appropriate channels. See ECF No. 20 -4 at 2. Marciano fails to articulate how this process falls below the constitutional floor; and, given the case law making clear that \"informal procedures,\" as opposed to a \"formal hearing,\" are sufficient prior to an employee's termination, see Ezekwo v. N.Y.C. Health & Hosps. Corp., 940 F.2d 775, 786 (2d Cir. 1991), it appears that he was afforded constitutionally adequate process. Accordingly, Marciano's fourth cause of action is dismissed.

(212) 805-0300 App. 38 1 papers -- 2 THE COURT: Let me ask you one question. It was 3 timely, right? They had 30 days. 4 MS. FINN: Right. But it did not include some very 5 key documents that I think the rules require. Now, you may 6 consider -- 7 THE COURT: The hearing transcript should have been 8 annexed, but you, very kindly, cured this defect by filing the 9 transcript with the Court, and I've read it and am fully 10 familiar with it. So I think that objection is no longer 11 meaningful. 12 MS. FINN: Your Honor, there were other documents that 13 were omitted. 14 For one, defense counsel Fowlkes' December 13, 2021, 15 46-page opposition to her application for a temporary 16 restraining order that was E-filed in state court was not 17 included. The affidavit of Michael Melikofsky E-filed in state 18 court in opposition was also not included. A copy of a 19 reasonable accommodation E-filed by the defendant -- I'm sorry. 20 It was a department of health reasonable accommodation form 21 that was filed in the lower court was not provided to the Court 22 and then there was the transcript. 23 I think that, you know, this kind of dovetails with 24 the argument that this really is -- it should have stayed in 25 the state court. If they were going to remove it, they should CLCaTseMM1A:2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 39 of 35 39 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 39 1 have removed it before they briefed, they opposed, they 2 appeared, and this argument that the TRO was not on notice is 3 completely incorrect. They were noticed, they opposed, and 4 they appeared. 5 THE COURT: My question is this. What I think you're 6 basically saying is that having 30 days, they, in your view, 7 waited around to see how they were doing on the TRO and when it 8 didn't come out the way they liked, they removed, a variation 9 on forum shopping. That, of course, goes on all the time. It 10 may be that strategic choices of that sort are not wholly 11 commendable, but they are part and parcel of normal litigation 12 strategy. So even on your view of the underlying facts, I 13 don't see how they weren't still within their rights to remove. 14 MS. FINN: If that's your opinion, your Honor, I'll 15 move on to why it's improper. 16 The reason it's improper is that they failed to 17 substantively address the nature of the federal claims or 18 explain why the state court cannot adjudicate them. The 19 substance of this claim is a state law violation. The 20 defendants are trying to lop Detective Marciano into a basket 21 with numerous amounts of other cases in state and in federal 22 court. 23 For example, one of the exhibits provided, I think, 24 yesterday, it's docket entry 20-6, Exhibit F, that is a 25 decision on an order on motion in the state court. And I CLCaTseMM1A:2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 40 of 35 40 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 40 1 believe the defendants are trying to lump our case in with all 2 these other cases. 3 And I think, if you carefully look at what Judge Perry 4 did in Supreme Court, it's fairly clear. These cases are 5 completely different. This case is not about religious 6 accommodation. It is not a First Amendment right to refuse. 7 It is not a collective bargaining argument. It's none of those 8 things. If you look at the decision -- 9 THE COURT: Your complaint, of course, says that the 10 defendant, among other things, violated federal law by denying 11 your client both substantive and procedural due process. From 12 the very outset you asserted that there were both federal and 13 state issues here. 14 MS. FINN: Indeed there are. But the predominant 15 claim is a state court claim. You don't reach the federal 16 constitutional claims until the state court issue is resolved. 17 And in all these other cases that the defendants are trying to 18 claim Detective Marciano is akin to, there is a presumption in 19 those cases that the vaccination mandates were lawful. 20 Plaintiff is asking the Court to take a step back 21 further. The plaintiff is asking the Court to determine 22 whether or not the city has the authority to mandate anything. 23 Let me just go back to due process. Indeed there is a 24 due process and substantive due process claim, but they are not 25 a claims of a right to refuse the vaccine. The claims are, CLCaTseMM1A:2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 41 of 35 41 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 41 1 their substantive and procedural due process rights are 2 violated by a dereliction of the statutory protections. It's a 3 due process right to the statutory protections in the state 4 law, namely, Public Health Law 206(1)(l) that specifically 5 excludes adult vaccine mandates in this state. 6 The defendants go on and then they attempt to contort 7 Garcia, Garcia v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 8 which I think, your Honor, is the pivotal case here. The 9 reason defendants are trying to move into federal court and lop 10 our case in with all the other ones is because they don't want 11 to address Garcia. In their papers that they filed yesterday 12 the defendants indicated that the Court of Appeals had not 13 ruled on the authority of DOHMH to mandate vaccines during an 14 emergency. That is actually incorrect. 15 The fact is, that case, Garcia, had -- I mean, it was 16 like a boxing match. It started in the state court and the 17 state court agreed with plaintiff that 2164, Public Health Law 18 2164, prohibited the city from adding a flu shot. The case was 19 appealed to the First Department. The First Department upheld 20 that but on different grounds. The First Department held that 21 it was not necessarily a separation -of-powers claim but, 22 rather, the city was ultra vires. 23 It finally got to the Court of Appeals, and the Court 24 of Appeals reversed and determined that the Department of 25 Health and Mental Hygiene could indeed mandate a CLCaTseMM1A:2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 42 of 35 42 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 42 1 school-required vaccine for children. That's not disputed. We 2 understand that. 3 But where the problem is or the rubber meets the road 4 here is that the case in Garcia, the Court of Appeals was very 5 clear that it applied to childhood school-related vaccines and 6 went on to state that the legislature in New York State has 7 prohibited adult vaccine mandates. 8 THE COURT: Forgive me for interrupting. What about 9 the case of CF v. New York City Department of Health and Mental 10 Hygiene, which seemed to approve the vaccination for a 11 different disease, but vaccination for adults. 12 MS. FINN: Your Honor, that was a very interesting 13 case and Judge Scheinkman, of course, he is well known for his 14 bulletproof decisions. I don't really take issue with any of 15 those findings other than the case was mooted before it really 16 had a chance to go further. That case involved a nuisance that 17 was declared by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene 18 regarding a measles inbreak. At the time there were -- we were 19 in a measles crisis. That is what preceded COVID. 20 In Rockland County and in Brooklyn there are large 21 observant Jewish communities. In many of these communities, in 22 order to avoid having to vaccinate in New York State, you can 23 provide a positive immunity or what's known as a titer test. 24 If you show a positive titer to measles, you do not have to get 25 an MR vaccine. CLCaTseMM1A:2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 43 of 35 43 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 43 1 What I believe was going on in those communities, and 2 this is very common and it was common before the advent of 3 vaccines, if one kid got chicken pox, the mom would expose all 4 the kids to get it over with, to get the natural immunity. My 5 understanding of what happened is that these people in 6 Brooklyn, the community in Brooklyn, were actually 7 intentionally spreading the measles -- 8 THE COURT: Excuse me. Someone seems to be typing or 9 something in the background and haven't muted themselves. I 10 heard every word you said, but I ask whoever that person is to 11 make sure they are muted. 12 Go ahead. 13 MS. FINN: What was going on in Brooklyn was and in 14 Rockland, there was somewhat of an intentional spreading of the 15 measles. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which 16 has the authority to control children's school-related 17 vaccines, issued a nuisance order. And I would submit that it 18 was properly voted on, etc., and Judge Scheinkman upheld that. 19 The fact is, there were adults encompassed in that 20 mandate, but the nuisance order expired and the case was not 21 appealed. I believe, had it gone to the Court of Appeals, the 22 Court would have reversed, like it did in Garcia, and would 23 have held that Public Health Law 206(1)(l) prohibits adult 24 mandates. So that was kind of a unique case. It had sort of 25 expired on its own before it really had a chance and I know if CLCaTseMM1A:2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 44 of 35 44 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 44 1 I had -- 2 3 THE COURT: I'm sorry. I understood your point. Anything else you wanted to say on this motion before 4 I hear from the city? 5 MS. FINN: Your Honor, the procedural and substantive 6 due process claims do not even -- they are not even reached 7 until there is a determination as to whether or not Public 8 Health Law 206(1)(l) prohibits adult vaccine mandates. This is 9 a very simple case. And the defendants have a tendency to try 10 to suck these plaintiffs up into a vacuum with discovery and 11 this, that, and the other thing. There is no need. This is a 12 question of law. Either the legislature allows adult mandates 13 or they don't. And I think I sufficiently distinguished CF. 14 I would also add, the Second Department ruled at the 15 same time, in a Rockland measles challenge, that the measles 16 outbreak, or the claimed outbreak or inbreak, did not rise to 17 the level of an epidemic defined under the Executive Law 20.A, 18 which is also something that we would like a ruling on. 19 I'm not suggesting COVID is not a problem. I 20 understand it is. But our experts -- we have the same experts 21 as the defendant. We are relying on CDC data. And CDC data 22 says there is a 99 percent survival rate if you are infected 23 with COVID or one of its variants. The Supreme Court in 24 Jacobson v. Massachusetts , which articulated its state police 25 power to mandate a vaccine, there had to be an emergency. CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 45 of 35 45 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 45 1 There had to be an epidemic. It had to imperil society. 2 THE COURT: Wait. Hold on. I'm sorry. These are 3 important arguments, but I think they go to the second motion, 4 to the TRO. 5 The issue on the first motion, the one that I'm asking 6 be addressed now, is whether I should sever the two state 7 claims and send them back for the reasons you previously 8 articulated, or keep them together. Whether or not the CDC has 9 given you ammunition for seeking a TRO is a separate question. 10 So let me take the liberty of interrupting and asking 11 the city to respond, and then we will come back to you in a 12 minute. 13 MS. FINN: Your Honor, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to go 14 down the path with Jacobson there. But if I could just make 15 the point regarding the constitutional claims. Ten seconds. 16 THE COURT: Yes. 17 MS. FINN: The fact is, the due process and the 18 substantive due process arguments are not involving a right to 19 refuse a vaccine, a right of bodily autonomy. There is no 20 presumption here that the mandates are lawful. 21 And all the other cases that were brought had 22 presumed -- even if you look at Judge Perry's decision, she 23 says that plaintiffs concede the mandate is lawful. We do not 24 concede that. So this due process challenge is to the 25 Fourteenth Amendment right to the statutory protections the CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 46 of 35 46 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 46 1 public health law affords my client. He is an adult and he 2 does not want to vaccinate. Thank you. 3 THE COURT: Thank you very much. 4 Let me hear from the city. 5 MS. FOWLKES: Good morning, your Honor. My name is 6 Eugene Fowlkes. My colleague, Mr. Mendez, is addressing the 7 defendants' motion to dissolving the TRO, and I'm addressing 8 our response to plaintiff's motion to sever. 9 Now, we believe that we have addressed everything in 10 our papers which were filed yesterday evening. To the extent 11 that the Court has any specific questions, I would be happy to 12 attempt to answer them. 13 THE COURT: I do. Lucky you. 14 Implicitly, I think, plaintiff concedes that if CF v. 15 New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, a 16 decision of the Second Department in 2020, were the law of New 17 York that she would have a weaker case for remand because the 18 issue has already been, in effect, decided adversely to her. 19 But she says that case was not appealed and that Garcia, in her 20 view, casts doubt on that decision. What is your view of that? 21 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, both CF and Garcia make 22 clear that the board of health has the authority to mandate 23 adult vaccinations. In CF specifically, the Court specifically 24 upheld the board of health's authority to mandate specifically 25 adult vaccinations. CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 47 of 35 47 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 47 1 With respect to Garcia v. the New York City Department 2 of Health and Mental Hygiene, there the Court was addressing 3 the challenger's arguments with respect to holding that the 4 legislature did not have authority. They rejected that. The 5 Court stated that the legislature clearly delegated authority 6 and specifically that it did not violate the separation of 7 Harris doctrine to adopt these vaccination measures. 8 Specifically, on CF it's important to note that the 9 petitioners there filed an Article 78 alleging that the mandate 10 was arbitrary and capricious and nothing more, which is 11 different from what was filed here by plaintiff. 12 Initially, when he filed in state court, he filed a 13 hybrid Article 78 and complaint action alleging, as we have 14 stated, substantive and procedural due process rights and, as 15 counsel has specified just now, that this is based on the 16 Fourteenth Amendment. It's irrelevant specifically for the 17 motion to sever. Looking into the merits of CF and Garcia are 18 premature. The case here clearly discusses constitutional 19 violations. 20 And with respect to the preemption and 21 separation -of-powers arguments, they are merely amounting to 22 statutory interpretation issues, which this Court is able to 23 handle, especially given the claims and how they are 24 intertwined with the substantive and procedural due process 25 claims. CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 48 of 35 48 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 48 1 THE COURT: That was the main question I had for you. 2 Anything else, though, that you wanted to respond to? 3 MS. FOWLKES: No, your Honor. That will be all. 4 Thank you. 5 THE COURT: Back to plaintiff's counsel. Anything 6 further you wanted to say? 7 MS. FINN: Yes, your Honor. It's been held in the 8 Second Circuit and the Southern District that you can sever the 9 law claims and remand to the state court -- 10 THE COURT: I totally agree. I have that power. I am 11 not required to do it. It's a question of discretion. 12 MS. FINN: That's right. But where the claims raised 13 are novel and complex issues of state law or where the state 14 claims predominate, which is the case here, that is the real 15 body of the case. 16 We have a real conflict here with Garcia. The 17 defendants claim that the Court of Appeals authorized DOHMH to 18 authorize an adult vaccine, and that is not what Garcia said 19 and that is not what the legislature intended. 20 I would add that in December of 2020, the legislature 21 enacted a novel coronavirus legislation. And it's worth 22 pointing out they delegated no authority to any regulatory or 23 administrative agency to do anything other than contact 24 tracing. Traditionally, a mandatory vaccine, which admittedly 25 involves rights of bodily autonomy, is within the authority of CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 49 of 35 49 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 49 1 the legislature of the State of New York. Boreali v. Axelrod 2 was very, very clear. It stated that the legislature cannot 3 cede fundamental medical decision making to anyone other than 4 the legislature. The City of New York was struck down on the 5 size of the soda cap ban under Boreali. They were struck down 6 on smoking ban regulations. 7 Now, you can put a cigarette out. You can avoid a 8 Coca-Cola in a 25-ounce cup. But once you're vaccinated, 9 that's it. There is no way to unring the bell. My client has 10 demonstrated he has natural immunity, and there is a wealth of 11 evidence to show that people with natural immunity who are 12 revaccinated can in fact experience a hyperimmune reaction, and 13 they do die. 14 I recently settled a case for a child who had the 15 exact reaction to a countermeasure vaccine, which is my final 16 point, your Honor, on irreparable harm. They are claiming that 17 my client's loss of health insurance, loss of his stature, loss 18 of his position, loss of his pay, is something that can be 19 compensable in a later action. That's completely not true. 20 THE COURT: Again, I'm sorry. These are important 21 arguments, but I think they go much more to the TRO question of 22 irreparable harm and so forth. So I do want to get to that, 23 but I want to, for now, deal with the severance issue. 24 Let me once again take the liberty of interrupting. 25 I'm impressed with the arguments, the skill with which you are CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 50 of 35 50 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 50 1 making those arguments, but I do want to keep the two motions 2 separate. 3 I think I'm ready to rule on the first motion. I am 4 going to deny the motion. Once again, I think plaintiff's 5 counsel has raised some interesting points. 6 I start with the obvious proposition that all these 7 claims ultimately arise from the same factual situation, and 8 there is obvious judicial economy in not having two separate 9 lawsuits arising from the same basic facts. Furthermore, in my 10 court we move with considerable expedition, and we would be 11 able to resolve all these matters in prompt fashion. 12 But if the plaintiff's arguments really raised novel 13 or complex issues that substantially predominated over the 14 federal claims, that would give me pause. I take a longer view 15 of that and I think it's not really the case. Ever since 16 vaccinations or, as they used to be called, immunizations came 17 into play more than a hundred years ago, these kinds of issues 18 involving the authority of New York City's Board of Health, as 19 well as the state, to require immunization in certain 20 circumstances has been the subject of litigation. Most of the 21 litigation has resolved itself in favor of the city and the 22 state. 23 A case that was not mentioned by the parties, and no 24 reason they should, but, in my view, is really the seminal 25 case, is the Metropolitan Board of Health v. Heister, which is CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 51 of 35 51 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 51 1 37 N.Y. 661. It's a decision by the highest court of the State 2 of New York in 1868. That just shows you how early these kinds 3 of issues got decided. That case very strongly supported the 4 authority of the New York Board of Health to issue the kind of 5 mandates they have issued here. I'm not deciding today whether 6 that is dispositive. I am just saying these issues are not 7 nearly as novel as I think plaintiff believes. 8 I also think that this is further supported both by 9 the CF case that I mentioned, which I think plaintiff's counsel 10 agrees would be very devastating to her position. And so far 11 as Garcia is concerned, I read it the way the city reads it 12 and, therefore, not supportive of plaintiff's position. 13 In the end, exercising my discretion, I am going to 14 keep the entire case and deny the motion to sever and remand. 15 Let's turn to the city's motion to vacate the TRO and 16 here the city is the moving party. So let me hear first from 17 the city. 18 I am not hearing anything, which makes me think 19 someone is on mute. 20 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, this is Ms. Fowlkes. Mr. 21 Mendez may be having trouble unmuting himself. Just one second 22 while I confirm. 23 THE COURT: That's a serious problem for any lawyer. 24 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, it appears that the clerk 25 may have muted Mr. Mendez. CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 52 of 35 52 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 52 1 THE LAW CLERK: If that's the case, if he just hangs 2 up from the conference and then calls back, we will have him 3 back. 4 THE COURT: While we are waiting, just a quick 5 question that doesn't have to do with these motions, but just 6 really out of curiosity a question for Ms. Finn. 7 My understanding is your client separately has filed a 8 request for reasonable accommodation. What is that based on? 9 MS. FINN: His religious beliefs, your Honor. 10 THE COURT: What religion is he? 11 MS. FINN: He is Catholic. 12 MR. MENDEZ: I am back, your Honor. 13 THE COURT: Just finishing what I was saying. Hasn't 14 the Pope strongly encouraged people to have the vaccine? 15 MS. FINN: Yes, he has. But the courts have been 16 very, very clear, including the Supreme Court. I think you can 17 look at, if I pronounce it right, Lukumi v. Babalu, you have 18 Yoder v. Wisconsin , you have Seiger. In those cases the 19 Supreme Court held -- actually, in the Eastern District, Judge 20 Wexler in Sherr and Levy v. Northport , there were multiple 21 determinations that one does not have to be a member of a 22 particular religious or organization in order to obtain a 23 religious exemption to a vaccine. In fact, it has been 24 determined that it is a personal interpretation of one's faith. 25 THE COURT: That's very helpful. It's not before me, CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 53 of 35 53 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 53 1 so I don't want to get -- I was just curious. But it's not an 2 issue before me. In the present posture it's before the state 3 authorities, the city authorities. 4 Now that we have counsel, let's turn to the motion to 5 vacate the TRO. Let me hear from the city. 6 MR. MENDEZ: Good morning, your Honor. I am back. 7 The first thing I want to do is just briefly clarify 8 an error in our papers, your Honor. 9 In point 1 of our papers I indicated that the TRO, 10 pursuant to the Carrabus case and Rule 65(d) of the Federal 11 Rules of Civil Procedure, would expire yesterday. Upon a 12 closer reading of Carrabus , the TRO would actually expire 13 today, which is 14 days from when the case was removed to 14 federal district court. 15 I want to start briefly. I think the Court 16 understands the holding in Garcia, so I am not going to dwell 17 on Garcia unless the Court has specific questions about that. 18 THE COURT: My question, and this will be more for 19 plaintiff's counsel than for you, but I had trouble seeing 20 where there was, at this stage, irreparable harm because the 21 plaintiff is still being paid. He has his pending motion for a 22 reasonable accommodation on religious grounds. 23 So it seems to me, while there might be a stage later 24 on, if that accommodation request is denied, that there might 25 be a basis for saying that there is irreparable harm. I don't CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 54 of 35 54 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 54 1 really see it now. And that's even aside from the fact that we 2 are only talking about money. Because plaintiff's counsel is 3 saying, yes. But this is not like a big company or a 4 multimillionaire. This guy needs his pay. But as of now, as I 5 understand it, he is getting his pay, correct? 6 MR. MENDEZ: Yes, your Honor. 7 THE COURT: Now, what about the argument that 8 plaintiff's counsel makes that, OK, but if the mandate were 9 upheld and if the reasonable accommodation were denied, then he 10 would suffer irreparable harm because he is not in a financial 11 position to go without pay. What about that? 12 MR. MENDEZ: So the first thing I'll say, your Honor, 13 is that that's what counsel had said and that was the 14 assumption that the state Supreme Court made. But there is 15 nothing on the record suggesting that plaintiff will suffer 16 financial harm. We can only go by what's on the record. 17 THE COURT: Excuse me. Hold on. Someone, again, is 18 not muting themselves. Whoever is talking need to mute 19 themselves. 20 Go ahead. 21 MR. MENDEZ: We can only go by what's in the record. 22 I'm not saying that somebody losing their paycheck isn't a bad 23 thing. It can lead to some bad things as well, your Honor. 24 But we can only go by what's on the record. 25 Point 1 is, there is nothing on the record suggesting, CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 55 of 35 55 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 55 1 as the Supreme Court stated, that the plaintiff is going to be 2 homeless, for example, as a result of not receiving his 3 paycheck. And the type of harm that plaintiff is alleging 4 here, literally every court that has passed upon this has 5 concluded that pecuniary harm, it's settled. It is not 6 sufficiently irreparable within the context of an application 7 for a TRO or a preliminary injunction. I preface that by 8 saying that I'm not insensitive to the potential hardships that 9 that could impose on someone, but the law is what the law is. 10 The law is that way in the State of New York and it is that way 11 in the United States, in the courts of the United States. 12 THE COURT: Let me turn to plaintiff's counsel. 13 Again, although, as you know, to warrant a TRO you 14 have to make various showings. The one that I'm really 15 focusing on and I would ask you to focus on is irreparable 16 harm. Am I right that at the moment the plaintiff is being 17 paid? 18 MS. FINN: Yes. He is waiting for a determination on 19 his accommodation. 20 I would point out that the defendants indicated they 21 have already denied 6,000 of them. I don't know what that 22 decision will be. 23 THE COURT: I guess what strikes me is, we don't know 24 how that decision is going to come out. If it comes out 25 adversely to you, then I would think you would have a basis for CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 56 of 35 56 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 56 1 coming back to this court and saying, OK, now we have 2 irreparable harm. Although the city points out, I think 3 correctly, that the vast majority of cases have said that where 4 there are damages available that deprivation of this sort is 5 not irreparable harm, I'm open to considering that that may not 6 be ultimately how the case should be viewed in the case of an 7 everyday working person because I can see -- and I'm not making 8 any determination now, but I can see an argument that it's very 9 different for an everyday working-class person to lose his pay. 10 We would need, as the city points out, to know a lot 11 more. We would need to know what the plaintiff's savings were. 12 We would need to know whether he had available loans, whether 13 he had available family support. All of those would have to be 14 the subject of evidentiary submissions. But I'm not prepared 15 to totally foreclose the possibility that there could be an 16 unusual case where economic harm would nevertheless be 17 irreparable harm. 18 But here we are not there. He is getting his pay. 19 Until he is no longer getting his pay, why should I consider 20 that a TRO is warranted? 21 MS. FINN: Your Honor, the due process and substantive 22 due process claims are a right to the statutory protections of 23 the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment right to 24 the statutory protections of Public Health Law 206(1)(l) that 25 prohibits adult mandates. Constitutional violations are CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 57 of 35 57 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 57 1 routinely recognized as triggering irreparable harm unless they 2 are promptly remedied. This has been going on for months and 3 it's not getting better. It's getting worse. 4 Moreover, the fact is that my client is responsible 5 for his family and he is very, very afraid. And to suggest 6 that he would be able to get damages at a later time, which 7 these other courts have held, has two problems. One, in those 8 cases the presumption was the mandate was lawful. We do not 9 concede it's lawful. In fact, we rely on Garcia and we rely on 10 the novel coronavirus legislation. This is an illegal mandate. 11 The mayor, the police commissioner, even the health department 12 do not have the authority to mandate. All these efforts are 13 considered COVID-19 countermeasures. 14 They are preempted under the PREP Act. I think there 15 is another act. But if you look at a case called Parker v. St. 16 Lawrence in the Third Department in New York State, in that 17 case the mother had declined consent to have her child 18 vaccinated. When the kid got to school, the school nurse went 19 ahead and vaccinated. She turned around and sued for battery. 20 The Third Department held that liability protections for 21 countermeasures taken by certain covered persons in response to 22 a declaration of public health by the secretary are provided 23 for by the PREP Act, and it provides that covered persons shall 24 be immune from suit and liability under federal and state law 25 for all claims for loss. CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 58 of 35 58 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 58 1 So to suggest that he can get another job or he can 2 sue the city, it's never going to happen. The city has such 3 broad immunity. If I was defending the city, I would argue no 4 standing because the PREP Act is a liability protection for a 5 pandemic countermeasure, and this is a pandemic countermeasure, 6 so he is out of luck. The threat of losing one's job, not to 7 mention all the other plaintiffs similarly situated. 8 Maybe we could talk a little bit, if your Honor wants, 9 about this argument that we are trying to skirt a putative 10 class. And the Second Circuit in the Kane case talks about how 11 defendants raised an applied constitutional challenge to the 12 mandate that the teachers were facing. The Second Circuit in 13 that case allowed for a stay to address the 15 plaintiffs on 14 the applied constitutional challenge, but did not allow the 15 same for the in fact challenge. 16 And the reason is for precisely this point I'm trying 17 to make. You have to independently show that you have 18 particular damage if you are alleging the constitutional 19 violation in the denial of the religious exemption. That's not 20 what's happening here. 21 If Detective Marciano is successful in convincing your 22 Honor that the state legislature has prohibited an adult 23 vaccine mandate to avoid piecemeal litigation, then everybody 24 else affected by this same mandate would be covered, and that 25 is not uncommon. It's actually quite common when it comes to CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 59 of 35 59 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 59 1 vaccine cases. 2 Again, I direct the Court to Sherr and Levy v. 3 Northport and Judge Wexler's 1983 decision. Judge Wexler 4 decided, he took a look at the Public Health Law 2164 and the 5 requirement that somebody be a member of a religious 6 organization in order to get a religious exemption to attend 7 school. Judge Wexler took that case and he struck down 2164 or 8 at least that part that required membership in a religion that 9 had bona fide tenets contrary to vaccinating, which gets to 10 your point about the Pope. 11 Judge Wexler said, and this has been adopted in all 50 12 states, that you do not have to be a member of a religious 13 organization; that you have to have a personal religious 14 belief, your interpretation. You could be in a synagogue and 15 sitting next to somebody who is reading the torah and comes to 16 a completely different conclusion about your body, about 17 vaccines. It's the same in a church. 18 THE COURT: I don't know enough about the Catholic 19 religion, but I would say there is no person in the Jewish 20 religion who corresponds to being a Pope. So I am not sure the 21 analogy is totally apt, but I understand your point. 22 MS. FINN: Thank you, your Honor. 23 I would say that many rabbis throughout this state 24 have come down on both sides of this issue. 25 So, again, it goes to the wisdom of Judge Wexler in CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 60 of 35 60 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 60 1 Sherr and Levy where he said it doesn't matter what your 2 established orthodox religion thinks. It's what you think. 3 It's how you interpret this scripture. It's your relationship 4 with Jesus Christ. 5 What Judge Wexler did there is what I'm concerning you 6 to do, please, is to look at how Judge Wexler found it 7 incumbent upon him to address the statute, to avoid piecemeal 8 litigation. 9 Currently, there are many police officers that are 10 refusing the vaccines and not getting paid. They are 11 ineligible for unemployment. And the threat of termination, 12 based on a substantive and procedural due process violation in 13 the denial of the statutory protections of Public Health Law 14 206(1)(l), is sufficient to establish irreparable harm. He 15 can't sue. Even if you determine in the end that plaintiff was 16 right, he can't turn around and sue the city. And if the law 17 department doesn't know that, they should. 18 THE COURT: I'm sorry. At least so far as the federal 19 claims are concerned, you can bring an action for damages 20 against state authorities acting in their official capacity. 21 That's the famous Monell case that has been law of the United 22 States now for several decades. I think, at least so far as 23 the federal claims are concerned, that you are not correct. I 24 see these cases every day. 25 MS. FINN: Your Honor, dare I disagree, but I would CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 61 of 35 61 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 61 1 submit to you that this is not the case. The PREP Act is a 2 broad liability protection and it covers, among other things -- 3 let me see. There is one exception and that is for death or 4 serious injury. Otherwise, a COVID-19 countermeasure is 5 no-fault liability. There is no way that the plaintiff in this 6 case would be able to sue. The immunity provisions apply to 7 any claim for loss that has a causal relationship with the 8 administration of the covered countermeasure. 9 I have dealt with these cases for a long time, and 10 defendants rarely understand the preemption of the PREP Act, 11 and I think it goes to the heart of irreparable harm. You have 12 a constitutional violation. 13 THE COURT: Maybe I'm still not understanding your 14 point. In Monell, which, for the benefit of the record, is 15 Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New 16 York, 436 U.S. 658, a 1978 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, 17 the Supreme Court held, as a matter of constitutional law, that 18 if a state agent acting in their official capacity violated the 19 federal Constitution, an action for damages would lie. I don't 20 see how that can be possibly affected by what you are referring 21 to. 22 MS. FINN: Your Honor, I don't presume to know the 23 breadth that you know of the law, but I am quite sure that 24 liability protections for pandemic countermeasures taken by the 25 mayor are preempted from a liability suit under federal and CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 62 of 35 62 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 62 1 state law. And the fact that maybe nobody has raised it is 2 possibly because this area of jurisprudence is so bizarre and 3 it's evolving so rapidly. 4 And I would submit that a lot of the cases that were 5 filed, with all due respect, they were ill-conceived. Even the 6 unions. They are arguing that this is a non-- that the term 7 for the vaccine was not part of the collective bargaining. 8 It's seen deeper than that. 9 The fact is, you can't collectively bargain for a term 10 that is fundamentally illegal that violates the statute. You 11 don't even get to collective bargaining. You don't even get to 12 religious accommodation. 13 This is purely a question of state law. You've 14 already ruled on that, and I appreciate that. But it's whether 15 or not you can permit an adult mandate in New York State. The 16 answer is no. If we prevail, my client is precluded, under the 17 PREP Act, from bringing a cause of action against his employer, 18 a Monell with standing. 19 THE COURT: Let me hear from the city on that last 20 point. 21 MR. MENDEZ: Though I am not familiar with the PREP 22 Act, your Honor, I do still remember from Professor Cheryl 23 Hannah's first-year common law class that Congress can't, 24 through legislation, abridge a right guaranteed by the 25 Constitution. CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 63 of 35 63 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 63 1 The Supreme Court has said that a private litigant can 2 sue a state pursuant to that Monell decision to seek money 3 damages for redress for a constitutional violation. I don't 4 see how the PREP Act changes that. 5 We have nothing further to add that hasn't been 6 included in the papers, and we will rest on our papers, unless 7 the Court has further questions. 8 THE COURT: No. Thank you very much. 9 Again, I'm prepared to rule. I am going to vacate the 10 TRO, though without prejudice to its being reraised on terms 11 I'll get to in a moment. 12 In my mind, this is a fairly simple issue because, in 13 fact, the plaintiff is being paid his salary and has not 14 suffered any financial harm. Nothing has changed in the status 15 quo other than the threat of possible action. And the threat 16 of possible action can sometimes be a basis for a TRO. 17 And I take plaintiff's point that this may be 18 particularly true when it's an alleged constitutional 19 violation, although I think the argument that it is an 20 alleged -- it a constitutional violation may not be the 21 strongest of plaintiff's arguments. 22 But here he has a pending request for a reasonable 23 accommodation. And while there are cases that go both ways on 24 that issue, it would be, I think, premature to impose a TRO 25 barring the city from going forward with a mandate until, at an CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 64 of 35 64 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 64 1 absolute minimum, we know that his request for reasonable 2 accommodation has been denied. If it is denied, then on the 3 question of irreparable harm we'd have to get into some of the 4 issues that have been raised, and that would probably require a 5 prompt evidentiary hearing. 6 I don't reach at this point the other requirement for 7 a TRO, namely, a likelihood of success on the merits. But I do 8 agree with plaintiff's counsel that most of the issues in this 9 case appear to be issues of law rather than fact. 10 My understanding is that Magistrate Moses granted the 11 city until February 15, the time to move or answer. Magistrate 12 Moses, of course, is one of the great magistrate judges of our 13 court, but I'm a much more inpatient person. 14 I assume that the city is going to move to dismiss and 15 that all the pure issues of law that both sides have spent a 16 lot of time already discussing in connection with the pending 17 emergency motions will be raised there. 18 So I'd like to ask the city whether they can get in 19 their motion to dismiss much sooner than February 15. 20 MR. MENDEZ: We can, your Honor. Would three weeks 21 from today be satisfactory to the Court? 22 THE COURT: Yes. Today is the 29th. That would be 23 Wednesday, January 19. 24 How long does plaintiff's counsel want to respond? 25 MS. FINN: Thirty days is the usual, right, Judge? CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 65 of 35 65 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 65 1 THE COURT: Not in my court it isn't. Plus, don't you 2 have every reason to want to move this promptly? 3 MS. FINN: I do, your Honor. We will respond -- I'm a 4 solo. I don't have all the resources -- 5 THE COURT: But you've already impressed me with the 6 realty of your knowledge. Plus, this is right up your alley, 7 right? 8 MS. FINN: Yes, sir, it sure is. 9 THE COURT: Why don't I give you the same three weeks 10 I gave them. How about that? 11 MS. FINN: I will move as quickly as I can. 12 THE COURT: When I set a deadline, it's a deadline in 13 my court. 14 MS. FINN: Yes, sir. 15 THE COURT: Three weeks from -- let me ask my law 16 clerk, who has got a 2022 calendar. 17 THE DEPUTY CLERK: Judge, three weeks from the 19th is 18 February 9. That's a Wednesday also. 19 THE COURT: February 9. 20 How long does the city want to put in reply papers? 21 My suggestion is a week or a week, but take your choice. 22 MR. MENDEZ: We will take the Court's suggestion. 23 THE COURT: Very good. 24 Linda, that is -- 25 THE DEPUTY CLERK: February 16. CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 66 of 35 66 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 66 1 THE COURT: We will have oral argument a week from 2 then. 3 THE DEPUTY CLERK: You're at Berkeley. 4 THE COURT: I'm at Berkeley. 5 MR. MENDEZ: Your Honor, could I ask for the city to 6 have 30 pages in the moving brief? 7 THE COURT: Yes. Let me finish the schedule. Then 8 I'm happy to talk about length of papers. 9 MR. MENDEZ: Thank you. 10 THE COURT: Linda, when am I back from Berkeley? 11 THE DEPUTY CLERK: You're back on Monday, the 28th, at 12 which time we are picking a jury. 13 THE COURT: Let's do it at 3:30 on the 28th. 14 THE DEPUTY CLERK: I'm just pulling up the balance of 15 that day. You already have a sentencing at that time, and you 16 have to leave at 5:45. That's not bad. But the sentencing is 17 on at 4:30. You could do it at 3:30. Sorry. 18 THE COURT: If necessary, we can move the sentencing. 19 I think this is important and we move it forward. 3:30 then on 20 February 28. Very good. 21 In terms of length of papers, I have no problem with 22 30 pages for the city in their moving papers, 30 pages for the 23 plaintiff in her responding papers. But I think reply papers 24 need to be limited to 10 pages. 25 In terms of everything else, I am going to stay all CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 67 of 35 67 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 67 1 discovery and all further proceedings in this case because I 2 think the motion to dismiss has a fair chance of resolving this 3 case one way or the other. 4 Is there anything else we need to take up today? 5 MS. FINN: Your Honor, if I may, I know it is 6 premature to reargue. But the Supreme Court has got a rocket 7 docket going on right now with January 7 scheduled to hear 8 challenges brought by, I think it's 25 states with regard to 9 the OSHA mandate. I would say there is a clear analogue here 10 with what the mayor has done. The Fifth Circuit ruled the 11 actions of the president exceeded his power. The Sixth Court 12 disagreed. Now the Supreme Court is going to rule on that. 13 Is there any way that you would possibly consider 14 extending the TRO to at least the 7th? Because I need to meet 15 with my client, and there are other police officers that are 16 out of work. 17 THE COURT: They are not before me. I appreciate what 18 you are saying. As I said, my vacating of the TRO is without 19 prejudice. So if either something arising from the Supreme 20 Court or something arising from other people that they want to 21 join this lawsuit, or whatever changes the situation, of 22 course, then you can come back to me. 23 Let me mention in that regard, both sides should 24 familiarize themselves with my individual rules. I don't allow 25 parties to submit anything in writing to the Court before first CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 68 of 35 68 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 68 1 jointly calling the Court. The reason I do that is, I can move 2 things much more quickly. If either side has an application at 3 any time, get a hold of your adversary, call my chambers. 4 Usually, if I'm not on the bench, I will give you a ruling 5 right then and there. One of my clerks described this as a 6 dial-a-judge system, but hopefully it's a little more formal. 7 In any event, if I'm on the bench when you call, I'll get back 8 to you before the end of the day with a ruling. 9 I am not going to extend the TRO now. But I leave the 10 door open for you to come back to me if circumstances change. 11 MS. FINN: Yes, sir. Thank you. 12 THE COURT: Anything else anyone needs to raise? 13 MR. MENDEZ: Your Honor, I would just ask that if it 14 is plaintiff's intention to amend her complaint to either add 15 claims or parties that she provide a date certain or that the 16 Court set a date certain by which she is to do so. We don't 17 want to run into a situation where the amended complaint or an 18 amended complaint is being filed the day before or the day our 19 motion papers are due. I think it would just provide more 20 clarity to the parties moving forward if we have a date 21 certain. 22 THE COURT: I think that's reasonable. But I also 23 think, in fairness to the plaintiff, that should await her 24 receipt of your moving papers. I would say, if she is going to 25 amend, she has to do so within 10 days after receiving your CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 69 of 35 69 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 69 1 moving papers, and then we can adjust. If we have to adjust 2 schedule, we will on that basis. 3 I assume that works for plaintiff's counsel as well? 4 MS. FINN: Your Honor, am I precluded from amending 5 prior to that, if I can? 6 THE COURT: No. You can amend tomorrow, if you would 7 like. But my suggestion is, since you're as hard working as 8 you are, that you wanted to take a couple of days off before 9 you turned to amending. In any event, you are not precluded 10 from amending sooner than that. You just can't amend after 11 that. 12 MS. FINN: Judge, one more thing, if I can. 13 THE COURT: Yes. 14 MS. FINN: With respect to the putative class argument 15 raised by defendants, if I am to amend and include an 16 individual that is -- or -- there has been 6,000 city employees 17 or NYPD employees denied religious accommodations. They are 18 out of work. Most of them are not vaccinated. My firm can't 19 handle 6,000 plaintiffs. 20 THE COURT: If you want to amend with a proposed class 21 action, of course. 22 MS. FINN: No, I don't. 23 THE COURT: You don't. If you just want to join one 24 person, that's OK too, but you can't have it both ways. 25 In your original complaint, if I remember correctly, CLaCsTeM1M:A2R1H-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 24 Filed 01/13/22 Page 70 of 35 70 SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 70 1 you said something about, and others similarly situated. 2 That's a nonstarter as far as federal procedure is concerned. 3 If you want to go the class-action route, fine. You can amend. 4 And if you want to just add one or two people who you think 5 will make it a stronger case for your legal arguments, that's 6 fine too. But you can't have it both ways. 7 MS. FINN: Understood, and thank you. 8 THE COURT: Anything else? 9 MS. FINN: No, sir, for plaintiffs. 10 MR. MENDEZ: No, your Honor. 11 THE COURT: Very good. I appreciate all your good 12 arguments, and I look forward to the continuation of this case. 13 I will issue a short order today just summarizing my 14 rulings And then maybe a longer opinion. I'll have to think 15 about that. 16 Thanks again. Bye-bye. 17 (Adjourned) 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 App. 71 APPENDIX 5 (Dist. Ct. Dkt. No. 42) 72 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

RAKOFF, District Judge APPEARANCES NEW YORK CITY LAW DEPARTMENT 17 OFFICE OF THE CORPORATION COUNSEL Attorneys for Defendants 18 BY: EUGENIA FOWLKES, ESQ. Assistant Corporation Counsel 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 73 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 73 1 THE COURT: This is Judge Rakoff. Would counsel 2 please identify themselves. 3 MS. FINN: Good afternoon. Patricia Finn, F-I-N-N, 4 for Anthony Marciano, plaintiff. Good day, sir. 5 THE COURT: And counsel for the defendants? 6 MS. FOWLKES: Good afternoon, your Honor. This is 7 Eugenia Fowlkes, assistant corporation counsel, and counsel for 8 defendants. 9 THE COURT: Okay. So we're here on both the 10 defendants' motion to dismiss and the plaintiff's renewed 11 request for a temporary restraining order. Let me deal with 12 the latter first. 13 Ms. Finn, do I understand that your client has 14 appealed the denial of his request for an exemption for an 15 accommodation. And so he still is on active duty, yes? 16 MS. FINN: Yes, your Honor. 17 THE COURT: So there's no reason to have a TRO at this 18 point. Aren't we in the position that we were at once before? 19 You know, if and when he is actually in immediate danger of 20 losing his job, you could come before this Court and ask for a 21 TRO and I will give it expedited treatment at that time, 22 probably the very same day, but until that happens, there's no 23 reason for a TRO, is there? 24 MS. FINN: Well, you know, your Honor, I think there 25 is and primarily Detective Marciano has a 3 percent chance of 74 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 74 1 getting his religious exemption approved. And when we met last 2 time, you know, irreparable harm was a very important issue. 3 And at the time, your Honor, we discussed whether or not 4 Detective Marciano, you know, had a large trust fund and, you 5 know, would be able to withstand that financial or pecuniary 6 injury. And, you know, I thought a lot about that, and I 7 explained to you that there is no way for him to recover any 8 type of damage, even in the end -- 9 (The reporter interrupted for clarification) 10 MS. FINN: If he were to be injured, whether 11 physically by the vaccine, or whether or not he was discharged 12 from his job. Your Honor, I would read a Supreme Court 13 decision, Elrod v. Burns . I cited it in my papers. And the 14 Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals, a decision to grant 15 the preliminary injunction, where the plaintiff was threatened 16 with dismissal based on a lack of patronage for the political 17 party in power. And I was very clear on what you explained, 18 and I understood that, but I do believe that he's got a very, 19 very slim chance here, and the constitutional violations are 20 the irreparable harm. It's not necessarily a pecuniary loss 21 but rather it is the denial of his Fourteenth Amendment and 22 Ninth Amendment due process rights to the statutory protections 23 and -- 24 THE COURT: But he has so far taken the position that 25 he's not going to comply because he thinks he's exempt or he 75 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 75 1 thinks it's illegal or whatever, and so in the meantime, he's 2 remained on active duty. And we all know that things are 3 changing rapidly and lots of restrictions are being eliminated 4 or reduced. It just seems to me that I shouldn't willy nilly 5 start issuing temporary restraining orders until there's a real 6 genuine imminence of harm because he's about to be taken off 7 active duty. And what I say to you, once again, is, if that 8 were to happen, then of course it would be easy for you to 9 reapply because you've already done your papers, so to speak, 10 and ditto the defendants, and I would decide that matter on a 11 highly expedited basis, probably within a matter of hours. But 12 I just don't see why it's a prudent use of this Court's 13 resources to issue a temporary restraining order now, assuming 14 arguendo that you qualify for one, when in fact nothing has 15 happened. I recognize that -- and we'll sort of get into this 16 on the standing issue when we turn to the motion -- that 17 threats of being fired and the like provide standing and maybe 18 even a basis for a TRO, but I just don't see it. It seems to 19 me like it's a waste of everyone's time at this point. 20 So I'm going to deny the TRO but expressly without 21 prejudice to your reapplying on an expedited basis if he is 22 told, you're about to be taken off active duty. So let's turn 23 to -- 24 MS. FINN: Thank you. 25 THE COURT: Let's turn to what I think is the more 76 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 76 1 interesting issue, frankly, which is the motion to dismiss. 2 And let me hear first from defense counsel, then from 3 plaintiff's counsel. 4 MS. FOWLKES: Good afternoon. This is Eugenia Fowlkes 5 for the defense. 6 I want to start off by saying that the standing issue, 7 as I recognize you just mentioned it, your Honor, the standing 8 issue is still -- defendants believe it's still the 9 predominating argument here because the decision has not been 10 finalized and so there is no injury in fact yet that plaintiff 11 can bring forth and can bring forth to this Court for it to be 12 redressed, and so -- 13 THE COURT: Well, there are cases out there that seem 14 to suggest that the imminent threat of action can provide 15 standing. 16 MS. FOWLKES: Yes, your Honor. Defendants recognize 17 that there is this imminent threat piece, but that imminent 18 threat consideration is not necessarily a factor here for the 19 same or similar reasons that the TRO -- that defendants argue 20 that the TRO should not be granted, because there has not been 21 anything that has occurred yet, and so there is yet no standing 22 on the part of the plaintiff to argue an injury that has yet to 23 occur. And in terms of imminence, it's not yet clear what the 24 injury might be, and it's hard to tell -- as your Honor 25 mentioned previously, things are changing, and things are 77 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 77 1 changing in a matter of moments. And so it's hard to tell 2 whether this may be imminent, that plaintiff's denial will be 3 finalized and it will be affirmed. That's too attenuated at 4 this moment to tell whether or not it is imminent and whether 5 it can be considered under the imminence prong. 6 THE COURT: So do we have any idea what the time frame 7 is here? 8 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, I was trying to get an 9 answer so far, and what it looks like here is -- you've read 10 the papers and opposing counsel has read the papers as well -- 11 that now that the appeal is before the Citywide Panel. The 12 Citywide Panel is handling all of these appeals, and there seem 13 to be as many as thousands of appeals in the process. The 14 first appeals in this batch, according to the Citywide Panel, 15 is the BOE, and then we have the fire department, FDNY. So the 16 NYPD just recently, as of last week, sent over the latest batch 17 of appeals, which means that they are essentially -- if they're 18 being considered in order, they are at the end. So it's really 19 difficult to tell at this moment how long that appeal will be. 20 But as you've mentioned, as you recognized earlier, 21 your Honor, while it's being appealed, the plaintiff is not 22 going to be moved. Plaintiff is not -- his status is going to 23 be unchanged. And so even though it's not quite clear or even 24 though we cannot articulate a very clear time line right now, 25 it is before the Citywide Panel, and they're just having to 78 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 78 1 handle a lot of appeals at the moment. 2 THE COURT: So it's not imminent, at least in any 3 ascertainable respect. 4 MS. FOWLKES: Correct. 5 THE COURT: Okay. So there are other arguments I know 6 that moving counsel has raised, but let me go, on this 7 argument, to Ms. Finn. 8 MS. FINN: Your Honor, I was told that the information 9 being shared in the department is that it can be quite some 10 time before they get to discussing whether or not the appeal is 11 valid. So I think we would be looking at quite a long time. 12 And there seems to be some dilatory tactic, waiting to the last 13 minute to turn us down, things like that, so I think it's going 14 to be quite a stretch. However, you know, my client had 15 standing in state court, and the city came to this court and 16 argued that there was jurisdiction for you to hear the case. 17 And you agreed, and here we are. And now for them to allege no 18 standing because there's no injury, well, I, again, dispute 19 that. I would direct your Honor's attention to the Supreme 20 Court's determination in National Federation case, a decision 21 rendered January 7th, and that case upheld the Fifth Circuit's 22 ruling in BST. And I suggest in my papers that all you really 23 need to do in our case is swap out the words \"President Biden\" 24 for \"Mayor Adams\" and then swap out \"OSHA mandates\" for \"the 25 vaccine orders.\" And I would also point out that in BST, and 79 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 79 1 in the National case in the Supreme Court, the issue of whether 2 or not those people had been fired was not relevant to this 3 determination. What the Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit 4 are looking at is whether or not there is an alleged 5 constitutional violation, and I do believe that it was -- I 6 think the language was even a minimal violation was sufficient. 7 The substance of those cases I think is -- the conclusion that 8 the Court had was you can't take a public health mandate and 9 then convert it to a workplace mandate through regulations. 10 They are -- regulations, particularly by the Court of Appeals 11 in Garcia and under the statute, public health law. 12 Moreover, if the health department was going to 13 attempt to impose a mandatory vaccine that is not provided for 14 in the legislation, my client is entitled to a hearing under 15 the Public Health Law 2120, and in that situation, the burden 16 would shift to the city to prove that my client is infected or 17 suspected of infection and that the vaccination is the least 18 restrictive alternative as opposed to PCR or -- PCR testing 19 or -- I suppose, or masking. 20 Your Honor, there were several early release inmate 21 cases, and it was held in one of those cases that the fact that 22 the inmate seeking early release had been exposed to COVID and 23 recovered demonstrated that natural immunity has a prophylactic 24 type of effect. 25 There is also evidence to suggest that an individual 80 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 80 1 that has natural immunity, like my client, could suffer an 2 adverse reaction. I don't know if you read the paper today, 3 but CDC is reporting 21 children -- I realize that's out of 4 millions, but there's a connection being made to people that 5 have previous immunity and are vaccinated again experience 6 hyper -immediate reaction. Now we're not here on the science; 7 we're here on the law. And the law protects my client's 8 substantive and procedural due process rights to the statutory 9 protections afforded to him under Public Health Law 2120, and 10 under that, he can file an Article 78 proceeding and demand a 11 hearing, and he did that, and we were ready to go in state 12 court, and now the city is claiming you have jurisdiction but 13 he doesn't have standing because he wasn't injured. Well, he 14 is injured, because he's entitled to a hearing, and in that 15 hearing, the burden shifts to the city. It is off of my 16 client. My client would have an opportunity to demonstrate 17 natural immunity, he would have an opportunity to demonstrate 18 PCR and masking, and he would be able to demonstrate that he's 19 not infected or suspected of infection, and that -- 20 THE COURT: I don't think it's an issue I need to 21 reach on the pending motion, but just out of curiosity, how do 22 you propose to prove that he has natural immunity? 23 MS. FINN: Well, he has positive titers, and positive 24 titers are blood work showing that somebody is naturally 25 immune, and that is on the record. 10 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 81 1 And I would add that when it comes to childhood 2 vaccines, where we all have a lot more experience, there are 3 many vaccines required under state law whereby an individual is 4 able to avoid that vaccine when they provide a positive titer. 5 For example, the measles MMR vaccine, where an individual has 6 the positive titers to the MMR vaccine, they can get a medical 7 exemption. So these issues would be appropriate, and I believe 8 we would have had an opportunity with Judge Nervo to present 9 this type of evidence. 10 THE COURT: All right. Let me go back to defense 11 counsel, and you can say anything you want to in response, but 12 also, if you wanted to briefly say anything on the merits, I'm 13 happy to hear that as well. 14 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, as far as the -- in response 15 to standing, defendants have already made the distinctions in 16 their papers, but to the extent that opposing counsel is 17 proposing that the right way for the defendants to proceed is 18 through Public Health Law 2120, Public Health Law 2120 only 19 applies to the control of dangerous patients. It's explicitly 20 titled as such. And so that is inapplicable here. We have the 21 New York City Charter, Section 553, which gives the 22 Commissioner and Board of Health the authority to promulgate 23 these types of issues in pursuit of protecting the public 24 health, and the New York City Administrative Code empowers the 25 Department of Health, specifically Section 17-109, which is 1 82 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 82 1 specifically about taking measures for vaccination. And so the 2 citations to the public health law are inapplicable here 3 because they ultimately do not -- they don't apply to the 4 plaintiff. 5 Plaintiff is asserting a right to bodily autonomy, but 6 defendants are not forcing plaintiff to do anything. 7 Defendants are not holding plaintiff down. And so the cases 8 that are cited to that reference detainee or confining 9 patients, they're not applicable here. And so this case and 10 similar cases have been upheld as a condition of a job, as a 11 condition of employment. And so that's not implicating a 12 fundamental right. And it's implicating the right to pursue 13 your employment, but it's not absolute. And defendants propose 14 that plaintiff had a choice here, and has a choice still. So 15 defendants will emphasize that we are not holding anyone down 16 for a vaccination, but we are proposing a choice here, and as a 17 condition of employment for a municipality \u2014here, for the New 18 York City Police Department \u2014a condition of employment was 19 lawfully promulgated, and that condition of employment is not 20 far off and it does not implicate a substantial fundamental 21 right. 22 And so, your Honor, defendants maintain that as of 23 this moment, plaintiff's requests are premature. There is 24 nothing for which he needs to be redressed at this moment. But 25 even on the merits, his claims would fail in light of the fact 1 83 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 83 1 that cases similar to this, disputing the vaccine mandate, have 2 continued to be upheld as a condition of employment, and it's 3 no different here. 4 THE COURT: All right. Thank you very much. 5 And I'll hear finally from plaintiff's counsel. 6 MS. FINN: Your Honor, first of all, the cases that 7 the city is referring to involve First Amendment claims, 8 collective bargaining, and EEOC violations. Every one of those 9 cases presumes the lawfulness of the mandate. We do not 10 presume any such lawfulness. The executive law does not give 11 the mayor the authority to implicate -- to mandate a vaccine 12 under the charter. The fact is that the court was crystal 13 clear in Garcia that the Board of Health authority is limited. 14 And I ask you this, your Honor. This is something 15 that occurred to me. If Garcia is interpreting the way the 16 city is suggesting, to give them the authority to impose an 17 adult mandate -- first of all, that's not what Garcia said. 18 Garcia said it was a child mandate that was provided for in 19 2164 and 2165. And in that case, schools requiring a flu shot 20 was what was at issue, and they at the same time clarified this 21 is not an adult mandate. 22 And the courts in Boreali , which was the smoking ban 23 case; Hispanic Coalition , which was the soda cup case; or in 24 Garcia , ruled that the authority was to oversee repeated 25 vaccinations and not to impose a mandatory vaccine. 1 84 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 84 1 And finally, if indeed the board of health has the 2 authority to mandate a vaccine, then why is it that the mayor 3 and the police commissioner and the fire commissioner and all 4 the department heads are trying to mandate this as an employee 5 mandate, which has already been shut down by the Supreme Court. 6 And I think BST from the Fifth Circuit is completely applicable 7 here. There was no allegation there that anybody had been 8 fired. But if indeed the Board of Health of the City of New 9 York has the authority to mandate a vaccine in the same way 10 they did to a flu shot, then why didn't the Board of Health do 11 this? There is absolutely no explanation from the City of New 12 York as to why they're deviating from the precedent in Garcia . 13 Garcia said you can do this for kids. If they think that 14 applies to adult mandates, then what is the explanation for 15 trying to do this through an employee mandate? It's arbitrary 16 and capricious. That alone demonstrates arbitrary and 17 capricious, because the Supreme Court, in a case called In re 18 Charles -- I'm sorry -- Court of Appeals, in a case called In 19 re Charles , specifically held that when a board or a body 20 deviates from preexisting precedent and they fail to provide an 21 explanation, that would be arbitrary and capricious. If the 22 city has authority to do this, then why is there a mandate? It 23 is arbitrary and capricious. 24 I believe you read all my papers, though. I'll end on 25 that point. But that is something that occurred to me. 1 85 M2S1MARA SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. (212) 805-0300 App. 85 1 THE COURT: Okay. So I'm sure that there are further 2 things that both sides might want to say, but I have your 3 excellent briefs and I also have other matters still later this 4 afternoon that I have to turn to. So this has been very 5 helpful. I will take the matter under advisement. You have my 6 ruling for the TRO, but on the motion, I will get you a 7 decision certainly, in the next week or two. And I thank both 8 counsel again for their excellent help. Thanks very much. 9 Bye-bye. 10 MS. FOWLKES: Thank you. 11 MS.

Supreme Court, 2 State of New York, Civil Term is now in session. 3 Honorable Frank Nervo presiding. Be seated and come to 4 order. 5 THE COURT: All right. Be seated please. 6 Before we begin, I am going to request that counsel 7 address the Court from the podium. When you are 8 addressing the Court from the podium, if you are 9 comfortable with it, you could remove your mask. When 10 not addressing the Court and when at counsel table 11 kindly leave your masks on. You will see the Court is 12 without a mask so I could be heard through the PA 13 system. I hermetically sealed myself in this little 14 box as best as I could. Under the new modified rules 15 of the court that is permissible, what I just 16 suggested. 17 So this is the matter of Anthony Marciano, 18 individually, and on behalf of all other individuals 19 similarly situated. Plaintiff/petitioner is against 20 Bill De Blasio, Mayor of the City of New York and 21 others, under Index Number 160914 of 2021. 22 May we have your appearances for the record, 23 please, initially on behalf of the plaintiff. 24 MS. FINN: Yes. Good afternoon, your Honor. 25 THE COURT: I can't hear. Sorry. Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 89 of 59 App. 89 3 Proceedings 1 MS. FINN: Patricia Finn, F-I-N-N, for 2 plaintiff. 3 THE COURT: Okay. Very good. And on behalf 4 of the defendant/respondents? 5 MS. FOWLKES: Good afternoon. 6 COURT OFFICER: Press the button. 7 MS. FOWLKES: Good afternoon. This is 8 Eugenia Fowlkes, assistant corporation counsel, counsel 9 for the City, respondents. 10 MR. MENDEZ: And Ivan Mendez, your Honor, 11 just observing. 12 THE COURT: The Court has reviewed the 13 submissions by the plaintiff and of course by the 14 defendants. And it's -- it appears to the Court, and I 15 am sure I will be corrected if I am wrong, that the 16 petition is based on essentially three premises; the 17 order that was issued -- the orders that were issued 18 violate certain of petitioner's constitution on civil 19 rights to, among other things, refuse informed consent; 20 that it violates the petitioner's right to Due Process 21 because the vaccinations have not been approved. 22 Secondly, that the authority to make the 23 determination to impose vaccination mandates is in the 24 legislature. And with respect to the action against 25 the Police Department and the Commissioner, that said Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 90 of 59 App. 90 4 Proceedings 1 Commissioner had no right or authority to issue said 2 rules and then enforce them, both constitutionally and 3 because they violate a contract. 4 Ms. Finn, did I essentially state your 5 position? 6 MS. FINN: Yes, your Honor. 7 THE COURT: Okay. I would like you to 8 address, if you don't mind, at the outset, the 9 allegation that the Mayor had no authority to issue 10 these orders to begin with in as much as, among other 11 reasons, there was no legislative authorization 12 provided? 13 MS. FINN: There or here? 14 THE COURT: Please. I think it's probably 15 best if you go from the podium. 16 MS. FINN: Sure. 17 THE COURT: If that works for you. 18 MS. FINN: Yes. 19 (Brief pause.) 20 MS. FINN: Your Honor, I -- our position is 21 indeed that the respondents do not have the authority 22 to mandate a mask on any NYPD employee. And you had 23 mentioned that it was a lack of legislative authority, 24 but I think we could peel that back and go one further; 25 it's actually preempted by Congress. That goes to the Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 91 of 59 App. 91 5 Proceedings 1 issue of informed consent. 2 In the documents that I received last night 3 from the City in opposition, docket entry 19, paragraph 4 25, the City indicates that the vaccine has been 5 approved. That is incorrect. While indeed in August 6 the FDA issued a rather confusing and convoluted 7 emergency use authorization, the fact is the only 8 vaccine -- although it's a Pfizer vaccine, the only 9 Pfizer vaccine is called Comirnaty. And Comirnaty is 10 not available in the United States. So it's somewhat 11 disingenuous to suggest that the Pfizer vaccine, the 12 EAU Comirnaty is available in the United States. It 13 definitely is not. And that's likely because there is 14 no liability protection. 15 Comirnaty is available -- or will be 16 available this month in Europe. But here in the United 17 States vaccines are typically liability -free, 18 particularly vaccines given to children. If you are 19 injured by vaccines, you go to vaccine court where you 20 sue the government. You don't sue the pharmaceutical 21 company. So right off the bat, that is a big problem. 22 And, you know, I could brief you on it, but the 23 Comirnaty vaccine, which is the only FDA approved 24 vaccine, is not available. 25 So, therefore, this brings in to the Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 92 of 59 App. 92 6 Proceedings 1 emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer and Moderna 2 vaccine that are available. Under the Food and Drug 3 FDA and Cosmetic Act -- sorry, I will look that up. 4 But it's under the Cosmetic Act, an emergency use 5 authorized drug, whatever it is, and there are 6 plenty -- anthrax vaccine was an emergency use drug, 7 but under Federal Law Congress has preempted mandates 8 of emergency use drugs. That's the bottom line. 9 I think there is a case that's illustrative 10 on this point. It was the District Court for D.C., and 11 it was a 2000 case involving vaccines mandated, 12 emergency use authorized anthrax vaccines mandated on 13 the military. And the Court clearly indicated that you 14 cannot mandate an unapproved off label vaccine. I 15 believe, also, although I can't keep up with all the 16 orders striking down all the mandates, but I do believe 17 a Florida court had struck down the Biden mandate on 18 soldiers. That would be in line with the case that I 19 talked about. 20 Secondly, under the state law, in December of 21 2020, a couple weeks after the emergency use vaccines 22 became available in New York, the legislature under the 23 novel coronavirus legislation specifically did not 24 mandate emergency use vaccinations, and the only 25 authority that the legislature had given to the Health Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 93 of 59 App. 93 7 Proceedings 1 Department, or in this case the City, was to do contact 2 tracing. There is absolutely no mandate for masks, 3 there is no mandate for PCR testing, and there is no 4 mandate for the vaccine allowed under the novel 5 coronavirus legislation, and the reason being Congress 6 preempted it under the Cosmetic Act. Period. 7 Now, if Comirnaty was available, you know, 8 that might be a horse of a different color, but it's 9 not. And I am not even sure if it's even being 10 distributed. So I draw the Court's attention to the 11 affirmation, paragraph 25, which boldly declares the 12 Pfizer vaccine is authorized. So now we have the novel 13 coronavirus legislation. I explained to you it only 14 allows for contact tracing; nothing else. 15 And then we move to the statute. Public 16 Health Law 206(1)(l) specifically prohibits an adult 17 mandate. Now, there is an exception for children. And 18 that issue has been exhaustively litigated in the 2nd 19 Department. We have the C.F. case, which respondents 20 -- the respondents referenced in their opposition. And 21 several other cases. And so there is a massive 22 difference between a childhood vaccine that if you are 23 injured from that you get to go to court and you -- you 24 get to go to vaccine court and get compensation. 25 Currently right now under the emergency use Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 94 of 59 App. 94 8 Proceedings 1 you can't do that. But, very specifically, this 2 statute clearly prohibits an adult vaccination mandate. 3 And I would suggest, or I would draw the Court's 4 attention to a recent Fifth Circuit Decision in BST 5 Holdings versus OSHA that shot down the Biden mandate. 6 And I think the Court's language in BST is highly 7 relevant here because the Mayor is doing exactly what 8 the President had tried to do. They are trying to take 9 a public health mandate that involves fundamental 10 decision -making about one's bodily autonomy and they 11 are trying to bypass legislative determination and 12 decision -making and convert this public health mandate 13 into an employment mandate. And that is exactly what 14 the Fifth Circuit reviewed in BST. 15 In addition to that, the Fifth Circuit talked 16 about how over-inclusive -- how overbroad and at the 17 same time under-inclusive this mandate is for the NYPD. 18 Specifically, it's overbroad because it takes no 19 account of natural immunity. Now, I want to be clear. 20 I am not -- this is not a battle of the experts. Half 21 of that opposition that I got last night is praising 22 the glories of the vaccines. I am not at all 23 challenging safety and efficacy of the vaccines. This 24 is a purely legal argument; preemption, separation of 25 power, and statutory construction, which brings me to Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 95 of 59 App. 95 9 Proceedings 1 my next point. 2 In the City's opposition they spend quite a 3 bit of time talking about the union cases that have 4 been brought and reasonable accomodation. I could 5 simply tell you this case is not that. This is not a 6 PERB issue. It's not a collective bargaining issue. 7 And the reason is you cannot contract for a mandate 8 that is fundamentally illegal. You cannot negotiate a 9 contract term that imposes an illegal mandate. And, 10 again, starting at the top, Food and Cosmetic Act, 11 novel coronavirus legislation, Public Health Law 206. 12 So, although I respect what the unions are 13 trying to do, and they may ultimately prevail, but 14 without a temporary restraining order which I am asking 15 you for here on the basis of statutory construction, 16 not bargaining, okay, I think it's so important to make 17 that decision. Those cases could take years to be 18 resolved because of the inability to really obtain a 19 TRO in a collective bargaining, unlike this case where 20 there are clear statutory problems, constitutional 21 problems, preemption, and of course separation of 22 powers, which brings us to the Mayor. 23 The Mayor has absolutely no authority to -- 24 nor does he have any authority to order it or to direct 25 subordinates to direct the Police Commissioner or the Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 96 of 59 App. 96 10 Proceedings 1 Health Department. Now, an important distinction here 2 might be with the Board of Health. If this Court is 3 familiar with Garcia versus City of New York, it's a 4 very interesting case. In the State Supreme Court that 5 involved a flu mandate that was added to the childhood 6 schedule. And the Court struck that down as -- as -- 7 it was violating the separation of powers. The 1st 8 Department upheld that, but on different grounds, 9 finding it was ultra vires. 10 The Board of Ed did have the authority, but 11 in this particular instance it had been overturned. 12 However, the Court of Appeals, you know, reversed and 13 said that the Board of Health does have the authority. 14 But, again, I emphasize, that flu shot was for children 15 and Public Health Law excludes adult mandates. It does 16 carve-out school-related vaccines. So I think Garcia 17 is illustrative here, and Garcia absolutely explained 18 Public Health Law and the difference between the adult 19 mandate. 20 THE COURT: Since you have segued into the 21 authority, or lack of authority of the Board of Health, 22 what is it -- 23 MS. FINN: Yes? 24 THE COURT: -- what is it -- this might be a 25 question perhaps directed to the Corporation Counsel Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 97 of 59 App. 97 11 Proceedings 1 when they are at the podium, but under what authority 2 did the Department of Health, and of course you would 3 say they had no authority, to issue the mandate that 4 they issued? 5 MS. FINN: They don't. 6 THE COURT: What authority -- so let me 7 rephrase the question for you. 8 What authority would they have needed to 9 issue the mandate that they issued? 10 MS. FINN: Okay, but it applied to children 11 on -- 12 THE COURT: Adults only. 13 MS. FINN: There is none. It's precluded. 14 THE COURT: Well, can it be argued that the 15 Commissioner has the authority under circumstances, and 16 of course they would argue this is one of those 17 circumstances, that the Commissioner could, in fact, 18 issue an emergency mandate such as we have here, but 19 then it would have to be brought before the Board 20 within five days for it to continue? 21 MS. FINN: No, it could not. 22 THE COURT: Could not. So you say -- your 23 position is that the -- that the Commissioner of the 24 Health and Mental Hygiene Service the Department of 25 Health has no authority under any circumstances to Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 98 of 59 App. 98 12 Proceedings 1 direct adults to be vaccinated? 2 MS. FINN: No, and the point I was making is 3 in Garcia you had a different situation. The Court of 4 Appeals found that the Board of Health does have the 5 authority to regulate childhood vaccines, but there is 6 no corresponding authority. 7 Moreover, even if the Board of Health was to 8 do it, there is procedural rules. There has to be a 9 notice. There has to be a hearing and there has to be 10 a vote. 11 THE COURT: That's right. And the hearing 12 and vote would be by whom? 13 MS. FINN: The Board of Health. 14 THE COURT: Okay. 15 MS. FINN: So -- 16 THE COURT: Was that done in this case? 17 MS. FINN: Pardon me? 18 THE COURT: Was that done in this case? 19 MS. FINN: No. 20 THE COURT: Okay. My question may be 21 rhetorical, but I just want to confirm my understanding 22 of the facts. 23 MS. FINN: No, it's a procedural issue. But 24 let me explain to your Honor why the Mayor is doing 25 this and not the Board of Health. Because the law is Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 99 of 59 App. 99 13 Proceedings 1 very -- 2 THE COURT: Wait a minute. The Board of 3 Health issued -- didn't the Board of Health also issue 4 a mandate? 5 MS. FINN: No. 6 THE COURT: It was just the -- 7 MS. FINN: Okay. Why is the Mayor tackling 8 this beast instead of the Board of Health? 9 THE COURT: So why is the Board of Health -- 10 why is the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene in 11 this case? 12 MS. FINN: Pardon? 13 THE COURT: Why did you sue the Commissioner 14 of Health and Mental Hygiene? 15 MS. FINN: Because they reissued a series of 16 orders that lack any legislative underpinning. And 17 they're a necessary party. We had to sue them. I 18 would have preferred to leave them out, but they are 19 in. 20 But the bottom line is, the Board of Health 21 is -- let's say even if the Board of Health wanted to 22 try and do this, it is possible that if the Board of 23 Health determined that a particular officer was a 24 threat, and they wanted to either impose a physical 25 restraint such as a mask mandate or they demanded they Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 100 of 59 App. 100 14 Proceedings 1 get tested every week, or the dreaded emergency use 2 vaccine, they would have to petition a magistrate under 3 Public Health Law 2120, and they would have to 4 demonstrate two important things; they would have to 5 demonstrate that the person being restrained or subject 6 to a judicial order of quarentine, that person would 7 actually have to be infected or suspected of infection. 8 My client has natural immunity. He tested 9 positive. He has already had COVID. So you can't make 10 that. Then we get to the second part; the least 11 restrictive means. Your Honor, I respectfully say -- I 12 do not diminish the totality of this COVID nightmare. 13 It has affected everybody. I mean, me personally. 14 Everybody in this room is struggling. But when you 15 look at this opposition document, everything is 16 hysterical. It's all exaggerated. It's one hundred 17 percent increase. Well, what does that mean? We went 18 from two people to four people? The fact is, the 19 government, the City is trying to, you know, drag us 20 into this battle of the experts where, you know, the 21 Courts are differential to a public health authority -- 22 THE COURT: Well, we don't get there, do we, 23 Ms. Finn, until we first establish that the Mayor had 24 authority to issue this order to begin with. 25 MS. FINN: I think, your Honor, even if the Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 101 of 59 App. 101 15 Proceedings 1 Mayor -- the Mayor cited an Executive Law authority, 2 but if you look at the Executive Law, Section 22-A, 3 it's a -- it defines disaster, and that definition 4 includes an epidemic. But although the City pointed 5 out the C.F. case, which was a completely different 6 case; you had a nuisance, it was declared by the Board 7 of Health that was procedurally appropriate, nothing 8 like what is going on here, the 2nd Department held in 9 C.F. that it was temporary, it had been over by the 10 time it got to the court, and the issue was whether or 11 not it was arbitrary and capricious. It's not. 12 What I am trying to point out here is that 13 the Executive Law, in order to enact an emergency 14 regulation, you have to have an emergency. The CDC -- 15 this is not -- this is not Patricia Finn or a couple 16 people that are protesting against vaccines. The CDC 17 is our authority. I didn't bring in a scientist from 18 Germany or someone else. I am asking you, your Honor, 19 to take a look at what CDC is saying. Aside from the 20 fact that they are all over the place scaring everyone 21 to death, unaware of the potential of the variants -- I 22 mean, everyone knows diseases have variants. How are 23 they so shocked that an omicron variant, or that the 24 delta variant -- is it reality? Is it really the 25 number of cases? Sometimes, your Honor, you want Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 102 of 59 App. 102 16 Proceedings 1 cases. Currently children seem to have a prevalence of 2 COVID antibodies, and yet they experience zero -- few 3 to none symptoms. Any children that have been injured 4 tended to have comorbidities; overweight, other 5 illnesses. I will set aside for a moment the total 6 inability to even track COVID data -- COVID deaths. 7 But the fact is that children, if they get COVID, they 8 decrease the prevalence of the illness in the 9 population. That's a good thing. Cases are a good 10 thing. 11 What we want to look at is infection fatality 12 rate. And according to the CDC we have a 98.7 percent 13 survival rate. And I would respectfully ask your Honor 14 to give me a ruling as to whether or not a 98.7 percent 15 survival rate rises to the level of an epidemic or 16 disaster as defined in the Executive Law. 17 I believe Judge Colon also in the I.R.O.A.R. 18 case specifically went through what the Mayor has to do 19 in order to declare an emergency. And she found that, 20 you know, this ain't it. This is not it. So, your 21 Honor, it's not case -- it's not the number of cases; 22 it's infection fatality rate. 23 THE COURT: Why are you limiting the criteria 24 to fatalities? 25 MS. FINN: Pardon me? Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 103 of 59 App. 103 17 Proceedings 1 THE COURT: Why are you limiting the criteria 2 to just fatalities? Why can't serious illnesses or 3 hospitalizations constitute an emergency? 4 MS. FINN: That is an excellent point, but 5 prior to COVID-19 we already had a hospital shortage. 6 The problem, what's going on in the -- there was 7 insufficient healthcare workers, insufficient -- 8 THE COURT: I am just questioning the 9 criteria that you are developing for what establishes 10 an emergency. 11 MS. FINN: That is what I am asking you. In 12 W.T. versus County of Rockland upheld by the 2nd 13 Department a week -- 14 THE COURT: How could I make that 15 determination without expert testimony as to what an 16 emergency is? 17 MS. FINN: Well, your Honor, you could rely 18 on the statistics and the definition in the Executive 19 Law. Judge Thorsen held that the minuscule number of 20 measles cases did not, in his opinion, and that was 21 based on government data -- it was actually based on 22 data offered by the county -- that the number of cases 23 did not rise to level of an epidemic. And that was 24 appealed to the 2nd Department and it was upheld. So 25 it wasn't disturbed. And then a week later Judge Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 104 of 59 App. 104 18 Proceedings 1 Knipel ruled in C.F. that that measles mandate was 2 lawful. The point being, in Rockland County and in 3 Brooklyn you have these concentrations of has Hasidic 4 communities. And what was happening in these 5 communities, they weren't intentionally spreading 6 measles to a point having to be vaccinated. It wasn't 7 an outbreak; it was an in-break. 8 And so the Health Department went through 9 appropriate procedures, Board of Health rules, they 10 declared a nuisance and, you know, I personally -- I 11 mean, I tried that case in Rockland, so I think I did a 12 good job. But I think my counterparts in Brooklyn 13 might have missed the mark slightly. 14 So, your Honor, in summary, unless you have a 15 question, you know, in addition to all this I would ask 16 you to think about what the Court -- the 2nd Department 17 did in C.F.. The 2nd Department specifically upheld 18 Jacobson versus Massachusetts. I know a lot of lawyers 19 have argued it's bad law, it's old law, it should be 20 updated, and that may be true, but this lawyer doesn't 21 believe that. I think Jacobson is an excellent 22 holding. And recently the Supreme Court, Justice 23 Gorsuch in Candan v. Newsome and Doe v. Mills -- I am 24 sorry, your Honor, it was Roman Catholic Archdiocese 25 versus Cuomo and Justice Gorsuch said that if Jacobson Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 105 of 59 App. 105 19 Proceedings 1 was to come in front of them today it would be upheld. 2 Why would it be upheld? Because Jacobson, all he faced 3 was a five dollar fine. He wasn't facing losing his 4 job, a suffocating mask mandate, an invasive PCR test 5 that could cause injury to the nasal cavity and the 6 brain. All he had to do was pay five bucks. And I 7 doubt that there's very few people that would pay five 8 dollars to get out of one of these mandates. 9 Jacobson foresaw the possibility of a vaccine 10 mandate being a plain and palpable invasion of 11 fundamental rights, and it's here. This is it. COVID 12 is absolutely overblown. It's the infection fatality 13 rate that matters, not the case rate. And that is true 14 of many, many viruss. We are an ecosystem. People 15 need exchange in order to develop immunity. 16 But, again, I really do not want to get 17 sucked into the science. Jacobson said a vaccine 18 mandate had to be necessary, harm avoiding, 19 proportional and nondiscriminatory. This mandate 20 imposed by NYPD is none of those things. Jacobson said 21 in order to -- the legislature, not the Executive, not 22 the regulatory agencies, for the legislature to impose 23 a mandate there must be grave danger. The Court -- I 24 believe the language was \"imperils society.\" There 25 must be an epidemic, there must be an emergency, which Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 106 of 59 App. 106 20 Proceedings 1 is how this ties into the statute, the Executive Law 2 20.A. 20.A defines a disaster as an epidemic. And the 3 2nd Department upheld Judge Thorsen's determination 4 that the rate of measles infection, which is higher 5 than COVID now, did not rise to the level of an 6 epidemic. 7 So I am not asking you to rule on the science 8 per say; I am asking you to rule on the legal 9 definition, and particularly to rely on the 1905 10 landmark vaccine refusal case, Jacobson versus 11 Massachusetts. The Court held there was a duty for -- 12 the Supreme Court held there was a duty for this Court 13 to adjudicate when a vaccine mandate is cruel -- not 14 sure if I remember the language specifically, but it 15 was -- it would be cruel to vaccinate people. And, you 16 know, that is what is going on right now. 17 May I just sum up thirty seconds? 18 THE COURT: Absolutely. 19 MS. FINN: So, your Honor, I will start at 20 the top. It's always a good place to start. 21 Congress has under the Food and Drug and 22 Cosmetic Act prohibits emergency use authorized drugs 23 from being mandated. It's preempted that the Comirnaty 24 vaccine is not available in the United States. And, by 25 the way, we have two weeks before Mayor De Blasio is Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 107 of 59 App. 107 21 Proceedings 1 replaced by Mayor Adams -- soon-to-be Mayor Adams. And 2 he's expressed relaxing these mandates. So I think a 3 temporary restraining order is appropriate because 4 think of the damage it's going to cause. 5 Secondly, that statement about Comirnaty to 6 the best of my knowledge is completely false. It's not 7 available. It's only EAU. Second, in December of 8 2020, when the EAU vaccines were already available the 9 legislature did not mandate a vaccine. And they 10 couldn't because they were preempted under the Food and 11 Drug and Cosmetic Act. It's simple as heck. And then 12 you got the statute 206(1)(l) which prohibits adult 13 vaccines. You have the authority of Garcia versus City 14 of New York for a resource on interpreting that 15 statute. 16 Finally, even if the Board of Health or the 17 Governor, or the Mayor, or the Police Commissioner 18 determined that an individual officer is a particular 19 threat, Public Health Law 2120 requires an additional 20 order of quarentine. I am sure this Court is well 21 aware of cases of people that may be mentally ill, or 22 someone who is sick that refuses to follow guidance. 23 It is the burden of the local Health 24 Department to petition the Court to establish that the 25 person is infected or suspected of infection, and it is Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 108 of 59 App. 108 22 Proceedings 1 the least restrictive means. They have not done that, 2 and they cannot do it, which is why the Board of Health 3 can't mandate a blanket mandate like they have. And 4 that was reaffirmed in BST versus OSHA in the Fifth 5 Circuit. And the Court was crystal clear; you cannot 6 convert a public health mandate into an employment 7 mandate particularly when the mandate is overbroad, 8 does not include a potential for natural immunity which 9 Federal Courts have recognized in the prisoner release 10 cases that -- inmates that had already been infected 11 and were let out, or were petitioning to be let out, 12 they had no risk of reinfection because they had 13 already gotten COVID and recovered. 14 So I think it's clearly defined that this 15 mandate, even if it was legal, is overbroad. It's also 16 at the same time under-inclusive. What about the 17 people being arrested? What about the mailman that's 18 coming into the police department? Or the Fed-Ex guy 19 or delivery guy, or whoever is there? The Court has 20 struck down mandates for larger companies over one 21 hundred as being both overbroad and under-inclusive. 22 And we have the same thing here. These police officers 23 are involved with people all over. 24 And, you know, I take issue with this 25 conclusion that eighty percent of the population is Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 109 of 59 App. 109 23 Proceedings 1 vaccinated. I highly doubt that. And I will just 2 leave it at that. But if they are, I would submit to 3 your Honor that the majority of them acquiesced because 4 they were afraid of losing their jobs. So I ask you, 5 your Honor, this does not rise to the level of a 6 disaster that imperils society. It's bad, I get it, 7 but it's not there. Thank you. 8 (Brief pause.) 9 THE COURT: Ms. Fowlkes, you care to respond? 10 MS. FOWLKES: Yes, your Honor. Just one 11 moment. 12 (Brief pause.) 13 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, we have addressed 14 these arguments as presented in the petition in our 15 opposition papers that we submitted last night. So to 16 the extent that you have any specific questions, I'd be 17 happy to answer them after I give my formal 18 presentation. 19 Now, specifically here for the purposes of 20 today, this issue regarding the vaccine mandate and 21 specifically regarding granting a preliminary 22 injunction on the vaccine mandate, this has been 23 litigated over and over again. It has been litigated 24 repeatedly and each time the courts here in New York 25 and the Second Circuit have refused to grant a Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 110 of 59 App. 110 24 Proceedings 1 preliminary injunction. And this Court's decision 2 today should be no different. 3 Now, specifically here for the purposes of 4 this preliminary injunction, opposing counsel has not 5 addressed the existence of irreparable harm. Now, 6 first, this case was brought over a month after the 7 Commissioner's order, over a month after the 8 Commissioner's order was distributed to municipal 9 employees and over a month after Mr. Marciano 10 presumably had notice on the order. So this delay 11 contradicts any irreparable harm -- 12 THE COURT: Sorry. Sorry for interrupting. 13 Has Mr. Marciano been put on leave without 14 pay status? 15 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, all that we are 16 aware of right now is that Mr. Marciano has applied for 17 a reasonable accomodation, and is awaiting a decision 18 on that. So since he applied for it he is not yet on 19 leave without pay status. 20 THE COURT: He is not yet on -- 21 MS. FOWLKES: That's correct. He is not yet 22 on leave without pay status because he has submitted a 23 reasonable accomodation request. 24 THE COURT: Okay. 25 MS. FOWLKES: Now, as for the irreparable Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 111 of 59 App. 111 25 Proceedings 1 harm, the only points that are brought up in the 2 petition is that Mr. Marciano would be forced to 3 succumb to a vaccine. Now, the vaccine mandate is not 4 compelling anyone to receive a vaccine. It's not 5 holding someone down and forcing them to receive a 6 vaccine. Rather, it is -- that the vaccine mandate is 7 asking municipal employees to comply with a term of 8 employment. 9 THE COURT: Was this term of employment in 10 effect at the time these people were initially 11 employed? 12 MS. FOWLKES: No, it was not, your Honor. 13 THE COURT: So it was a term of employment 14 that has been recently added under the current emergent 15 conditions? 16 MS. FOWLKES: That's correct, your Honor. 17 This is a term of employment that was, as you just 18 stated, your Honor, added as of recent developments in 19 the last few months. Now, the vaccine mandate is 20 asking municipal employees to meet this term of 21 employment, and they have the choice to meet this term 22 of employment or to not meet this term of employment. 23 THE COURT: And face possible -- being placed 24 on leave without pay? 25 MS. FOWLKES: That's correct, your Honor. Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 112 of 59 App. 112 26 Proceedings 1 THE COURT: Isn't that -- to use to a 2 colloquial term, strong-arming tactic? 3 MS. FOWLKES: No, your Honor, it is not. And 4 petitioner, plaintiff/petitioner would be subject to -- 5 THE COURT: Oh, it's a motivation. It's a 6 motivation for these employees to comply with this 7 mandate -- or this order which we will discuss in a few 8 moments with respect to its validity in the first 9 place -- to comply with the order that the Mayor issued 10 or you will be on leave without pay. So it's an 11 incentive, correct? 12 MS. FOWLKES: That's correct, your Honor. 13 THE COURT: Like the other incentives we've 14 heard about where the City offers one hundred dollars 15 to get a vaccination, things of that nature. 16 MS. FOWLKES: Similar. 17 THE COURT: Similar, but different effect to 18 the party. 19 MS. FOWLKES: Effectively, this would be 20 different in the sense that the Mayor is asking 21 pursuant to his authority as the Executive Branch. And 22 as -- 23 THE COURT: He is asking? So the ask is, 24 kindly follow my directive or you will soon be without 25 income? Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 113 of 59 App. 113 27 Proceedings 1 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, essentially yes, it 2 is to -- for municipal employees specifically to comply 3 with this term of employment, and it's a lawful 4 directive by the Mayor as has been -- 5 THE COURT: Under what authority can the 6 Mayor establish a term of employment after people have 7 been employed by the City of New York, or, in this case 8 the New York Police Department for some period of time? 9 How does that work? 10 MS. FOWLKES: Yes, your Honor. Allow me to 11 outline the process for this authority here. The Mayor 12 has the authority, and this was specifically outlined 13 in the I.R.O.A.R. case that opposing counsel cited to. 14 Judge Coleman described that the Executive Branch made 15 issue with reference to those entities within its 16 authority. 17 Now, Judge Coleman specified who is within 18 the authority. Those are subject to the Mayor's orders 19 and these are generally employees of the Executive 20 Branch which include municipal employees. Now, 21 additionally, this order was provided -- or was created 22 by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. And 23 that is pursuant to their own authority, specifically 24 that is brought in the City Charter. 25 Now, the City Charter, specifically Section Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 114 of 59 App. 114 28 Proceedings 1 556 -- 556 Subsection C, empowers the DOHMH with 2 jurisdiction to regulate all matters effecting the 3 health in the City of New York, including communicable 4 diseases. And, furthermore, the New York City 5 Administrative Code, Section 17-109 Subsection B 6 delegates this authority to the DOHMH to take measures 7 of general and gratuitous vaccines, or vaccination. So 8 the DOHMH has authority to adopt these vaccine 9 measures, and as for the -- 10 THE COURT: Pardon my unfamiliarity with some 11 of statutes you are referencing, and how they all work 12 together. Let me ask you this. Can the DOH do this in 13 total abrogation of Section 3.01(c) of the Health Code 14 which states, in substance, \"the Health Code does not 15 require the immunization of adults?\" 16 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, I am not sure I got 17 the first part of the -- before you asked the question. 18 THE COURT: Well, can the Department of 19 Health ignore Section 3.01(c) of the Health Code which 20 states \"the Health Code does not require the 21 immunization of adults?\" How does that factor into 22 what you just said? 23 MS. FOWLKES: Yes, your Honor. The 24 authorities that we cited separate from what you just 25 cited to the Section 3.01 of the Health Code, they are Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 115 of 59 App. 115 29 Proceedings 1 not exclusive of each other. Because the authority 2 that we are citing to here is legislatively -- this was 3 brought by legislative means. And this delegated the 4 authority to specific actors. And here it was 5 delegated specifically to DOHMH, and specifically to 6 the Commissioner. 7 THE COURT: And what statute was that that 8 was delegated by the legislature? 9 MS. FOWLKES: So, first, this is the New York 10 City Charter. 11 THE COURT: Yes? 12 MS. FOWLKES: And then we have the New York 13 City Administrative Code. New York City Charter 556, 14 Subsection C. New York City Administrative Code 15 Section 17-109, Subsection B, as in boy. 16 (Brief pause.) 17 THE COURT: Doesn't 17-109 refer specifically 18 to vaccinations that may be provided gratuitously, and 19 does not provide for mandatory vaccination? 20 MS. FOWLKES: That is correct, your Honor, it 21 doesn't say anything about mandatory vaccinations but 22 it does provide for gratuitous vaccinations. But this 23 is important because, as we have made clear in the 24 papers, this was promulgated in -- under the lawful 25 authority of what we just cited here. And the DOHMH is Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 116 of 59 App. 116 30 Proceedings 1 essentially providing a choice to municipal employees, 2 because it is able to provide this term of condition to 3 municipal employees specifically. This is not for the 4 rest of the city. This is not for private citizens. 5 This is for employees that work for the city. And it's 6 giving them a choice that they could either comply with 7 this or they could choose to find a job somewhere else 8 that has no vaccine mandate. 9 THE COURT: And that's a reasonable choice in 10 your estimation? 11 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, this is reasonable 12 because this is a term of employment. And although 13 this was something that they may not have signed on to 14 when they initially joined, this is a term of 15 employment that's been promulgated in light of 16 circumstances recently. 17 THE COURT: In terms of employment, can 18 themselves be changed during the course of somebody's 19 employment? 20 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, yes. 21 THE COURT: Not to be flip, were the 22 Commissioner of the Police Department or the Mayor 23 decide, well, we have a new term of employment; 24 everybody must be six foot tall to be a policeman. If 25 you don't fit that term of employment, nice knowing Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 117 of 59 App. 117 31 Proceedings 1 you. 2 3 4 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor -- THE COURT: How is that different? MS. FOWLKES: -- unfortunately, your Honor, a 5 hypothetical such as that or any sort of analogy is not 6 spot-on to the case at hand. But in an attempt to 7 answer the logic there, that would be subject to some 8 sort of judicial review as is the case here. 9 THE COURT: Exactly right. That is why we 10 are here; Judicial review of this term of employment, 11 which you are arguing is permissible by the 12 Commissioner -- by the Police Commissioner and is 13 reasonable -- 14 MS. FOWLKES: Yes, your Honor. 15 THE COURT: -- under the circumstances. 16 MS. FOWLKES: Yes. And, your Honor, I would 17 like to specifically point to the New York City Charter 18 Section 434 -- 19 THE COURT: Okay. 20 MS. FOWLKES: -- which delegates authority to 21 the New York Police Department's Commissioner to have 22 control of the government, administration, disposition 23 and discipline of the department and the police force 24 of the department. 25 And so specifically as to the argument that Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 118 of 59 App. 118 32 Proceedings 1 the Commissioner was unable to promulgate or enforce 2 the order at issue here, the Section 434 states that 3 this is within the Commissioner's authority. 4 THE COURT: Okay. 5 MS. FOWLKES: And, your Honor, specifically 6 here, as stated before, petitioner is not being 7 compelled to succumb to a vaccine. The petitioner is 8 being given a choice. 9 Now, essentially what the petitioner is 10 alleging is irreparable harm, for purposes of the 11 preliminary injunction, is that there is a loss of 12 employment. And the loss of employment has been the 13 type of harm that is plainly repairable. It can be 14 redressed through monetary damages. And as compared to 15 what is the situation currently, that we are fighting 16 this public health issue, petitioner should not be able 17 to -- should not be allowed to pause a vaccine mandate 18 that is designed to cover the public health's 19 interests, to cover the public health issues here just 20 for their personal interests. 21 They -- if they are successful, they could be 22 redressed after the merits have been heard, after the 23 conclusion of this. Loss of employment is not an 24 irreparable harm and, thus, should not be the reason 25 why the preliminary injunction is granted as to the Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 119 of 59 App. 119 33 Proceedings 1 vaccine mandate. 2 THE COURT: I understand that, without 3 question. But as a matter of discretion, let's say, 4 what harm would there be to the defendants in this case 5 were the Court to issue a TRO? And I am aware that's 6 not the standard, but I am just asking, what harm would 7 there be to the defendants in this case were the Court 8 to issue the TRO so that, in effect, the plaintiffs 9 such as Mr. Marciano and others similarly situated 10 could continue to litigate these matters without the 11 possibility of being without income, and all the 12 problems that would raise, including possible 13 foreclosure on their homes, their children -- of course 14 maybe I am exaggerating to make the point -- and their 15 wife and children to be homeless? What would the harm 16 be to the City under those circumstances? 17 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, the harm would be 18 that there would be nothing in place to at least 19 attempt to mitigate coronavirus COVID-19 infections. 20 If the City is unable to -- 21 THE COURT: So you are making my point that 22 what this effectively is, is strong-arming the 23 plaintiff and others to get the vaccine or face the 24 possibility of homelessness. 25 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, we disagree, but Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 120 of 59 App. 120 34 Proceedings 1 essentially if that is -- you know, if that is the 2 position you wish to take, absolutely. 3 THE COURT: It's a reasonable perspective. 4 MS. FOWLKES: Yes. 5 THE COURT: Okay. 6 MS. FOWLKES: But specifically here it is a 7 reasonable -- it's also reasonable for the Executive 8 Branch to create a term of employment, and the terms of 9 employment have been created time and again here, 10 specifically for municipal employees. So this is 11 limited to municipal employees and it is not as for any 12 other private citizens or private entities. 13 THE COURT: How does the reality that police 14 officers such as Mr. Marciano, detectives such as 15 Mr. Marciano are employed pursuant to a contract factor 16 into your argument? 17 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, you are referring 18 to the collective bargaining agreement? 19 THE COURT: Exactly. 20 MS. FOWLKES: Yes. So the Commissioner, the 21 NYPD Commissioner's order is, in effect, supplementing 22 the CBA, so the Commissioner, by the authority that was 23 promulgated to him, was the New York City Charter, is 24 able to supplement the terms of conditions here. And 25 so with respect to the CBA, this -- as for the specific Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 121 of 59 App. 121 35 Proceedings 1 terms that might be effected here, the Commissioner's 2 order would replace that. 3 THE COURT: Are there any restrictions on the 4 terms of employment that can be added or modified by 5 the Police Commissioner, or is it anything he believes 6 in the best interests of the City and police department 7 is appropriate? 8 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, the New York City 9 Charter has not specified, or lists any terms of 10 conditions that may be modified or that cannot be 11 modified. But the Commissioner by his or her very 12 position would have the authority to decide those 13 issues if and when they arise. 14 THE COURT: So there is no beginning point 15 and no ending point as to the Commissioner's authority 16 in that regard? 17 MS. FOWLKES: No, your Honor. There is 18 absolutely a beginning point in terms of the -- they 19 could not surpass what has been lawfully promulgated to 20 them. But it's specific to the administration of the 21 police force, specific to the governance of the police 22 force. And separate from whatever is at issue here -- 23 THE COURT: And you say that is not subject 24 to review? 25 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, you mean -- Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 122 of 59 App. 122 36 Proceedings 1 THE COURT: The terms of employment change. 2 MS. FOWLKES: Presumably this could be 3 subject to Judicial review if they are being asked to. 4 But we submit, your Honor, that this is -- this has 5 been upheld by numerous courts. And specifically as 6 for the New York Police Department's authority and the 7 order that he promulgated, this is not any different 8 from on the other orders as specific to the Fire 9 Department of New York, or to the Department of 10 Education. And so those two have been affirmed 11 unanimously. 12 THE COURT: By the 1st Department? 13 MS. FOWLKES: Sorry? 14 THE COURT: By the Appellate Division, 1st 15 Department? 16 MS. FOWLKES: By the 2nd Department. 17 THE COURT: Appellate Division, 1st 18 Department? 19 MS. FOWLKES: I would have to -- 20 THE COURT: I don't think you will find any. 21 MS. FOWLKES: Sorry? 22 THE COURT: I don't think you will find any. 23 MS. FOWLKES: So, your Honor, it's that the 24 Police -- 25 THE COURT: I understand the rules that I am Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 123 of 59 App. 123 37 Proceedings 1 bound by any Appellate Division whose already taken a 2 position on it, and I will take that into 3 consideration. 4 MS. FOWLKES: Thank you, your Honor. 5 THE COURT: Yes. 6 MS. FOWLKES: Is there -- does your Honor 7 have -- 8 THE COURT: May I look at my notes? I think 9 you'll concede it's an awful lot of material to absorb 10 in a week, particularly in view of all our busy 11 schedules. 12 All right. The orders were issued by the 13 Department of Health. 14 MS. FOWLKES: That's correct. 15 THE COURT: Was it issued by the Board of the 16 Department of Health or just the Commissioner? 17 MS. FOWLKES: The Commissioner, your Honor. 18 THE COURT: Correct me if I am wrong, I may 19 have read the cases differently, but isn't there a 20 requirement for the Commissioner then to present the 21 matter to the Board for a full vote of that board? 22 MS. FOWLKES: There is that requirement in 23 the statute but that requirement is not applicable 24 here. What the Commissioner ordered here is something 25 that has already been promulgated to him, and that is Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 124 of 59 App. 124 38 Proceedings 1 the -- that's a measure regarding a communicable 2 disease. 3 THE COURT: That was promulgated to him by? 4 MS. FOWLKES: By the New York City Charter, 5 or more specifically, by the Administrative Code 6 Section 17-109. 7 THE COURT: Just as a thought, there seems to 8 be an awful lot of run-arounds for the Executive to 9 take to avoid certain statutory or legislative 10 requirements. That obviously I will take a closer look 11 at. 12 MS. FOWLKES: If I may respond? 13 THE COURT: Sure. 14 MS. FOWLKES: The City is of the position 15 that this is not anything -- this is not skirting 16 around any sort of legislative policy making. This is 17 rule making, which is -- it's what the legislature gave 18 to the agencies. The legislature chose the end of 19 public healthcare and the means to promote that end by 20 empowering the agencies to add these necessary 21 directives or measures. And here it's specific to 22 mitigate this threat of communicable diseases. 23 So this is not -- this is not law making or 24 legislation creation, policy making, this is just 25 embracing the directives and the measures have been Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 125 of 59 App. 125 39 Proceedings 1 lawfully promulgated by statute. 2 THE COURT: Which would be -- which an 3 examiner of the various statutes may come to the 4 conclusion are inconsistent with other statutes 5 developed by the legislature. For example, Public 6 Health Law 206 which clearly says -- it was mentioned 7 in Garcia, Public Health Law 206, \"does not authorize 8 the mandatory vaccination of adults.\" 9 MS. FOWLKES: Your Honor, we would submit 10 that specifically without trying to go into the 11 specifics of Garcia, I would have to brief you at a 12 later date, this specifically is not in contradiction 13 with any other statutes because this is specific to the 14 Executive Branch and specific to municipal employees as 15 is provided by the statutes that we've discussed. 16 THE COURT: We are not dealing with the 17 general public, we are dealing with municipal employees 18 and, therefore, there is other criteria to be met. 19 MS. FOWLKES: That's correct. 20 THE COURT: All right. I understand there 21 are a number of other matters pending addressing 22 similar or the same issues in this one in other courts, 23 correct? One in particular, Justice Hagler of this 24 court, which has been put over to February. 25 MS. FOWLKES: I would have to confirm. Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 126 of 59 App. 126 40 Proceedings 1 THE COURT: I only mention it because it 2 appears to me that it's going to take some time for 3 these cases to work their way through the trial and 4 perhaps Appellate process. 5 MS. FOWLKES: Yes, your Honor. 6 THE COURT: At the -- frankly, at the risk of 7 stating the obvious, I presume there are others 8 elsewhere. 9 Did you want to speak to your co-counsel? 10 MR. MENDEZ: I just want to -- 11 THE COURT: Use the mic. 12 MR. MENDEZ: I just want to share with the 13 Court, yes, the matter before Justice Hagler that was 14 brought by the Correction Officers Benevolent 15 Association has been put off to February. There is 16 another matter tomorrow before Judge Frank on 17 preliminary injunction. That is in a case brought by 18 the Police Benevolent Association, the union 19 representing the police officers. And in that case the 20 union is challenging -- they claim not to be 21 challenging the mandate, though they actually are, but 22 they are focused on the reasonable accomodation process 23 that was offered to police officers. 24 THE COURT: Which raises the question in this 25 case, which either counsel could address; why is the Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 127 of 59 App. 127 41 Proceedings 1 reasonable accomodation standard not applicable to 2 Officer Marciano? Or is it your position that there is 3 no possible way to reasonably accommodate someone that 4 hasn't been vaccinated? 5 MR. MENDEZ: No, your Honor, he has requested 6 an accomodation. That is pending with the NYPD. No 7 decision has been met. While that is pending he's not 8 on leave without pay. He tests. He can continue to 9 work until such time as that request is provided. 10 THE COURT: Until such time as the hammer 11 comes down and the Commissioner says you are now 12 without pay, unless they come up with a reasonable 13 accomodation. 14 MR. MENDEZ: That's correct, your Honor. 15 THE COURT: All right. I just want to make 16 sure I was seeing the obvious. 17 MR. MENDEZ: Just briefly, your Honor, if I 18 may? 19 THE COURT: Certainly. 20 MR. MENDEZ: There's been a lot of talk about 21 Detective Marciano and, quote, unquote, other similarly 22 situated. I just want to put before the Court there is 23 no record before the Court as to the individual 24 circumstances of any other officers. There are no 25 affidavits, there is no testimony. We don't even have Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 128 of 59 App. 128 42 Proceedings 1 testimony from Detective Marciano. 2 So the assumption that as a result of the 3 imposition of the mandate the detective would 4 potentially lose his home and go homeless, that is not 5 a reasonable assumption based on this record, your 6 Honor. It's not in the record. They -- petitioner 7 made the record. 8 THE COURT: I understand your position. 9 Sure. For all we know Mr. Marciano could be 10 independently wealthy and in the end the proposition is 11 totally moot. But we don't know that. 12 MR. MENDEZ: That is as possible as some of 13 the other speculation that we could sit here and engage 14 in all day with the circumstances of thousands of other 15 police officers. Without a proper record, counsel 16 doesn't have organizational standing like a union 17 potentially would to bring a claim on behalf of 18 similarly situated individuals. There is one 19 petitioner. 20 THE COURT: All right. So, therefore, it's 21 your position that, at best, the caption is 22 inappropriate. 23 MR. MENDEZ: That and -- 24 THE COURT: And -- 25 MR. MENDEZ: And any order issued by the Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 129 of 59 App. 129 43 Proceedings 1 Court should necessarily be limited to Detective 2 Marciano because there is nobody else before -- 3 THE COURT: Well, that may be an argument you 4 may have to make in another court before another Judge 5 or not. I have not determined that yet. 6 MR. MENDEZ: We will just point out, we 7 addressed the standing issue in the papers. 8 THE COURT: Sure. 9 MR. MENDEZ: There is only one petitioner 10 here. 11 THE COURT: Right. Very good. Anything 12 further you wish to advise the Court, Ms. Fowlkes? 13 MS. FOWLKES: Nothing else, your Honor. 14 THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Finn, would you like 15 to respond? 16 MS. FINN: Yes. 17 THE COURT: I thought so. Okay. 18 (Brief pause.) 19 MS. FINN: Thank you. Your Honor, there is 20 indeed testimony on this record. Detective Marciano 21 has given an affidavit. And, quite frankly, and 22 respectfully, it doesn't matter if he's a millionaire 23 or if he is the poorest person in the world. The fact 24 is that he has a 14th Amendment Due Process right to 25 the statutory protections that prohibit adult vaccine Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 130 of 59 App. 130 44 Proceedings 1 mandates. He voted in the election. He voted for 2 legislatures that were in the position to engage in 3 fundamental medical decision -making, and the Court in 4 Boreali versus Axelrod specifically indicated in the 5 smoking ban, that it's -- it's an excess of power to 6 get involved with things involving fundamental medical 7 decision -making. 8 I mean, what could be more fundamental than 9 injecting someone with a substance they don't want 10 which could potentially injure them if they already 11 have natural immunity? You are absolutely correct, all 12 of these police officers are being strong-armed. And 13 the decision here is not about one police officer. If 14 it's invalid to him, it's invalid to everybody. And I 15 believe Garcia was a case also representative of others 16 individually situated, and that holding in Garcia 17 affected all children in numerous cases. 18 F.F. versus State of New York, the 2019 19 Fourth Department case challenging the repeal of the 20 religious exemption. That was a vaccine mandate case 21 brought on behalf of all similarly situated. So if it 22 violates Detective Marciano's rights, it violates 23 everybody. 24 And I would like to address one thing about 25 the temporary restraining order. I find it remarkable Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 131 of 59 App. 131 45 Proceedings 1 that the City actually claims that my client dragged 2 his heels when they have had this vaccine available for 3 over a year now. What is the hubbub? Another variant? 4 Another omicron? These things are coming like 5 watershed. You know what, the emergency is over. We 6 have to learn to deal with it. And the law, as you 7 absolutely pointed out, prohibits adult vaccine 8 mandates. It's the City that dragged their heels here. 9 It's the City that is manufacturing an emergency. If 10 they were so concerned about police officers, fireman, 11 sanitation workers, why didn't they do this last year? 12 I think that is an important point. 13 Further, Detective Marciano tried to obtain 14 anonymity. I am not sure if you were aware of that. 15 That was declined in the ex-parte division. And I 16 would respectfully ask that you allow me to reargue 17 that, because this case could end up to be another 18 Jacobson. And my client is a modest man. He's a 19 police detective. He takes his job and family life 20 seriously. And he doesn't want to be the poster case 21 for refusing vaccine mandates. But the fact is, he is 22 not. 23 With respect to the litany of cases raised by 24 the City, I respectfully advise this Court that those 25 cases involve religious freedom, religious Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 132 of 59 App. 132 46 Proceedings 1 accomodation, and whether or not this is a union 2 contract. Our case is different. There is no other 3 case out there. We have challenged this on preemption 4 and separation of power and statutory construction. 5 And regarding DOH's authority, as again you 6 aptly pointed out, it's gratuitous. Traditionally, the 7 authority of the Department of Health has been to 8 provide vaccine information. Free vaccines. Subway 9 signs. There's never before been this type of mandate. 10 I mean, all over the world people are looking at New 11 York and wondering what is going on here. The City is 12 crumbling under the weight of this. But the fact is, 13 you could offer free vaccines, you could put a sign up 14 in the subway but you can't hold somebody down and 15 mandate them without legislative authority; and in the 16 extreme, a Judicial Order of quarentine would be 17 required under 2120. 18 My client has a Due Process right to the 19 statutory protections of the State's law, which 20 specifically limit adult vaccine mandates. 21 Thank you. 22 THE COURT: Do you wish to be heard further? 23 MS. FOWLKES: No, your Honor. 24 THE COURT: Or Mr. Mendez? 25 MR. MENDEZ: No, your Honor. Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 133 of 59 App. 133 47 Proceedings 1 THE COURT: I will take a ten minute recess 2 and we will be back. I will review my notes here. 3 (Recess taken.) 4 COURT OFFICER: All rise. 5 THE COURT: Thank you. Please be seated. 6 All right. Thank you for your indulgence. 7 After hearing the arguments of both counsel and reading 8 the documents that have been submitted with all 9 appropriate references and exhibits, while the Court is 10 not unmindful of the precedent with respect to 11 temporary restraining orders, this Court at this time 12 grants the temporary restraining order in the interests 13 of equity and this Court's overarching power to 14 exercise the Court's inherent interest of justice 15 jurisdiction. They attempted no prejudice asserted by 16 the municipal defendants that they will retain the 17 right to seek fiscal recovery in the event they 18 ultimately prevail. 19 Conversely, requiring the individual 20 first-responders to bear the financial difficulties 21 during the pendency of these matters is not only an 22 unjust burden, but perhaps more concerning, provides 23 the defendants with the ability to exercise their 24 financially strong opposition to coerce the 25 first-responders to succumb to the demands of the Case 1:21-cv-10752 -JSR-BCM Document 20-5 Filed 12/27/21 Page 134 of 59 App. 134 48 Proceedings 1 Executive at the expense of losing their right to be 2 heard on the merits. 3 While a number of other judicial opinions on 4 the one hand recognize the sacrifices of our vaccinated 5 and unvaccinated first-responders during these 6 unprecedented times, such as the plaintiff in this 7 case, and on the other hand deny them the benefits of 8 their assured continued pay status while these matters 9 proceed through the courts, this Court will not adhere 10 to what this Court perceives as a most blatant 11 injustice and hindrance to the plaintiff's right to be 12 heard on the petition. 13 So, therefore, the temporary restraining 14 order is issued pending the determination of this 15 application. Thank you all very much. 16 MS. FINN: Thank you, Judge. 17 MR. MENDEZ: Your Honor, if I may? 18 THE COURT: How could I stop you? 19 MR. MENDEZ: I would just ask the Court to 20 clarify as to whom the TRO is being issued, which 21 employees? Are we talking all police officers? 22 THE COURT: I presume your argument is only 23 Mr. Marciano; and the petitioner -- counsel on the 24 behalf of petitioner is arguing all police officers. 25 Court declines to clarify anything further.
