Milwaukee, WI\u2014The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology has determined that most people with egg allergy can safely receive the flu vaccine under the care of an allergist or immunologist. In the past, individuals allergic to eggs were told to avoid flu vaccination because the egg protein in the vaccine could trigger an allergic reaction. However, flu vaccines contain only a tiny amount of egg protein, and recent clinical studies have found that the vast majority of people with egg allergy did not experience a reaction upon immunization. Either a two-step graded challenge or a single, age-appropriate dose may be used for safe administration in egg-allergic patients.To comment on "}
