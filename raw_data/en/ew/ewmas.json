We examined HPV type-specific antibody levels in unvaccinated young men who have sex with men (MSM) with natural infection and compared these with levels in those vaccinated against HPV. METHODS: Serum specimens at baseline were collected from MSM aged 16-20 years in the HYPER1 (Human Papillomavirus in Young People Epidemiological Research) and HYPER2 conducted HPV16-, and antibodies. We compared antibody levels for each HPV genotype between unvaccinated men (HYPER1) and vaccinated men (HYPER2) using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: There were 200 unvaccinated men and 127 vaccinated men included in the analysis. Median antibody levels among vaccinated men were significantly higher than levels among unvaccinated men for HPV6 (223 milli-Merck units per milliliter [mMU/mL] vs 48 < 21 < mMU/mL 72 mMU/mL, < .0001), HPV18 (161 mMU/mL vs 20 mMU/mL, P < .0001). Antibody levels did not change over time for up to 66 months for all 4 genotypes among vaccinated men. CONCLUSIONS: Among young MSM vaccinated with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, antibody levels for HPV6, HPV11, HPV16, and HPV18 were significantly higher than those in unvaccinated MSM following natural infection. Antibody levels following vaccination appeared to remain stable over time. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01422356 "}
