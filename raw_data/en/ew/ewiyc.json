Nowadays, there are various available formulations used as food supplements to stimulate the immune system. In light of the current pandemic and the large amount of fake news circulating the internet, it is important to analyze which of the active compounds from essential oils can be successfully used in the treatment of COVID-19 infections. We analyzed the current literature on the effects of essential oils against the new SARS-CoV-2 virus to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these compounds and establish their possible antiviral efficacy. The available studies have highlighted the antiviral potential of active compounds from essential oils, indicating that they could be used as adjuvants in treating various viral infections, including COVID-19, leading to a milder course of the disease, and improving patients' outcomes. At the same time, these compounds relieve pain and lift the mood in comorbid patients suffering from opioid addiction. Essential oils might be useful as adjuvant tools, not only against SARS-CoV-2 but also for a subset of especially vulnerable patients affected with both COVID-19 and opioid addiction. However, randomized clinical trials are needed to determine their efficacy and develop standardized high-quality preparations that can be safely administered to the general population.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-11-10", "cleaned_text": "Can Essential Oils Provide an Alternative Adjuvant Therapy for COVID-19 Infections and Pain Management at the Same Time? [https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15111387](https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15111387) Another study reviewed the chemical composition of herbal medicines known to be active against coronaviruses and evaluated their potential to prevent viral entry and replication as well as inhibit the viral enzymatic system. Many of these compounds have immunomodulatory properties (e.g., phenolics, terpenoid, polysaccharides) and some have been recently used as vaccine adjuvants (polysaccharides, saponins), highlighting the antiviral potential of herbal medicines [ [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Essential oils are known to have a stabilizing effect on mood fluctuations, depression, and anxiety, which has been shown in clinical studies [ [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Another important use for essential oils is pain relief [ [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. The first and hardest step in treating opioid misuse is going through the opioid withdrawal phase. The opioid withdrawal symptoms (OWS) vary in severity, type and duration, but are often severe and lead to the patient's death, if not treated properly [ [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Some of the symptoms include insomnia, anxiety, dysphoria, fever, sweating, vomiting and diarrhea, muscle spasm and pain, abdominal cramps, tremor, piloerection, rhinorrhea, mydriasis, and tachycardia [ [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. The treatment of OWS uses mainly -opioid receptor and partial (buprenorphine) agonists, 2-adrenergic receptor agonists (clonidine, lofexidine), and ancillary medications for anxiety and sleep (benzodiazepines), muscles cramps (ibuprofen), nausea and vomiting (bismuth subsalicylate, ondansetron) [ [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. However, essential oils could be used as both adjuvants for pain management and instead of the ancillary medication to reduce OWS. [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. The situation is comparable to the application of aromatherapy to reduce opioid Therefore, the intention of this review article is to point out the not fully recognized potential of aromatherapy and essential oils for a specifically vulnerable subset of COVID-19 patients who also suffer from opioid misuse and addiction. 2. In Silico Effectiveness of Essential Oil Constituents [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Another docking study analyzed the inhibitory effects of various major components from essential oils (star anise, cinnamon, tea tree, lavender, thyme, mint, etc.) against the S1 unit of the spike protein, which is responsible for the binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme prevented viral replication in the host cells [ [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Many of these essential oils are already known for their antiviral activity. The antiviral activity of carvacrol on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease was also confirmed by a second study using molecular docking and molecular dynamics, which also assessed the ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties. Cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol, eugenol and menthol also suppress macrophage recruitment and production of different proinflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, having anti-inflammatory and beneficial effects on the lungs [ [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Carvacrol is a compound that has already been analyzed for its antimicrobial potential [ [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Eucalyptus oil is another essential oil, which is worth a second look, as it has already been used in the treatment of various respiratory diseases. Besides its antimicrobial activity, one of its main active components 1,8-cineol (eucalyptol) has myorelaxant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects reduces monocytes and macrophage recruitment. Inhalation of 1,8-cineol improves the quality of life in patients suffering from asthma and COPD and is recommended as adjunctive therapy. In silico studies have described the binding of 1,8-cineole and jensenone (another active compound from eucalyptus oil) to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and forming hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic and ionic interactions [ [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. A further in silico used to inhibit ACE2 in silico. Isothymol showed the most promising results, having good drug-likeness properties and high binding affinity, which were comparable to captopril and chloroquine [ [27](#B27-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. The essential thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, -terpinene, and -linalool) was tested in vitro for its therapeutical potential in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) caused by coronavirus. As cases of feline infections with the SARS-CoV-2 have already been reported and treatment options are very limited, it is important to devise therapeutic alternatives to treat not only human but also animal COVID-19 infections [ [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Quercetin is available as a food supplement and has already been used in various countries as an adjuvant to treat COVID-19. Molecular docking revealed that 17 organosulfur compounds from garlic (99.4% of garlic essential oil components) can strongly interact and block ACE2 protein and SARS-CoV-2 main protease [ [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. ACE2 in the host cells and SARS-CoV-2 main protease represent valuable targets to develop new drug candidates. Melaleuca cajuputi Powell is a plant common in southeast Asia. Through GC-MS analyses, 24 main compounds were identified in the essential oil of M. cajuputi, including terpineol, cineol, -selinenol, -eudesmol, -eudesmol, and that ACE2 protein and SARS-CoV-2 main protease can be blocked, thereby preventing the viral replication through the synergistic interaction of 10 of these compounds. According to the screening program, terpineol, guaiol and linalool have the strongest inhibitory effect, followed cineol, -selinenol, and - and -eudesmol [ [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. These results play a key role for the Brazilian population in the fight against COVID-19, since many of the species containing these essential oils are traditionally used. In addition, another promising candidate is Buriti oil extracted from Mauritia flexuosa L., a native plant from the Amazon region, which is famous for its biodiversity. Buriti oil is rich in carotene compounds (13-cis--carotene, 9-cis--carotene, and -carotene), which interact with the main viral peptidase [ [33](#B33-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. One of the world's smallest countries, the Seychelles islands, offers another possible candidate against COVID-19. Lodoicea maldivica (J.F.Gmel.) Pers. (Arecaceae), a palm their antimicrobial properties [ [34](#B34-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. 3. The Pathway from In Silico to In Vivo [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Various clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of garlic extracts in viral diseases such as acute respiratory viral infections, flu, hepatitis B and C and human papillomavirus-induced recalcitrant multiple common warts (RMCW), using different administration routes (oral, nasal, or topical) and doses. The severity of the infections was significantly reduced in the case of common cold and flu infections. In patients suffering from chronic hepatitis, the administration of garlic extract improved the serum levels of aminotransferase (ALT and AST). Furthermore, lipid garlic extract eradicated genital RMCW significantly (70%) better than cryotherapy [ [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. [35](#B35-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. N. active nigellone, -hederin, immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects. Patients with co-morbidities (respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes) are at a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 infections, as these cases are often accompanied by bacterial coinfections (pneumonia or sepsis). However, animal experiments have showed beneficial effects of N. sativa extracts in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and release of histamine, modulating autophagy, improving serum glucose, and cholesterol levels. Therefore, administration of N. sativa oil as a supplement may have beneficial effects in patients with comorbidities [ [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Furthermore, in a clinical trial, patients suffering from mild COVID-19 infection received capsules containing 500 mg of Nigella sativa oil twice a day for 10 days. Patients receiving Nigella sativa oil had reduced COVID-19 symptoms and recovered faster from the infection, compared to the control group [ [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. [39](#B39-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Tea tree oil inhibited the replication of influenza virus A/PR/8 subtype H1N1 in vitro by preventing endosome acidification and membrane fusion. It revealed high antiviral efficacy in aerosol and vaporized form, as it inactivated 99% of the influenza A virus. Additionally, the essential oils of M. angustifolia inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory effects [ [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. The antimicrobial potential of tea tree oil was further highlighted by in situ analyses. Accordingly, tea tree oil films on keyboard surfaces significantly reduced the contamination and transfer of pathogens (S. aureus, MRSA, and Enterobacteriaceae) to patients treated in an intensive care unit (ICU). Thus, tea tree oil could be used in combination with other surface cleaning products in ICUs to control bacterial spread [ [41](#B41-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. [42](#B42-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. [43](#B43-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Furthermore, in vitro studies have proved the potential of Listerine\u00ae (an ethanolic solution containing menthol, thymol, eucalyptol, and methyl salicylate) to significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 activity, in comparison to the use of ethanol alone. Clinical trials are still ongoing to establish the potential of these compounds in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections [ [44](#B44-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. According to the Cochrane Special Collection, the use of antimicrobial mouthwash and nasal sprays is recommended for healthcare workers who have direct contact with COVID-19 patients, patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures, and COVID-19-positive patients, whose outcome was improved by these mouthwashes and nasal sprays. Because most of the studies are still ongoing, the results regarding the efficacy of these measures remain to be determined [ [45](#B45-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. 4. Essential Oils in Pain Management and Opioid Dependence [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-15-01387-t001)) for their analgetic role. for its antimicrobial, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects and found in the essential oils of thyme and oregano, is possible candidate. The dose-dependent (50 or 100 mg/kg) antinociceptive effects of carvacrol have been assessed by using different models of pain in mice, such as acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction, formalin, and a hot-plate test. Two studies described a reduction of pain in mice after oral or intraperitoneal administration of carvacrol, but the underlying mechanisms of carvacrol remained unclear, as the acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction and formalin test did not show any effects on the opioid system or the nitric oxide pathway [ [46](#B46-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [47](#B47-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Lower doses of carvacrol (12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg) administered orally in mice revealed anxiolytic effects without impairing locomotor activity [ [48](#B48-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Animal tests have showed that carvacrol decreased the expression of various inflammatory factors in the brain (IL-1 and TNF-), regulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), dopamine expression and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) and activated the nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2), demonstrating its antioxidant and neuroprotective effects [ [49](#B49-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. This is an essential role of carvacrol, as the chronic use of opioids leads to neurodegeneration [50](#B50-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), esters of thymol and carvacrol have a more potent analgesic effect, compared to the initial monoterpenes. Additionally, these novel esters also revealed a prolonged anticonvulsant activity and, in combination with gidazepam, they have a synergistic effect in preventing seizures [ [53](#B53-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. A small clinical trial showed that the analgesic effects of essential oil of Thymus vulgaris L. are comparable to ibuprofen in treating dysmenorrhea in young adults [ [54](#B54-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. The neuroprotective effects of thymol are partially explained by its potential to reverse the effects of amyloid-- and rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in rats [ [56](#B56-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [57](#B57-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)], activation nuclear respiratory factor (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway [ [58](#B58-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)], and interaction with the GABAA receptor, which also explains the anticonvulsant potential [ [53](#B53-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [59](#B59-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Through the above-mentioned effects, plus its antispasmodic and anxiolytic activity, thymol proves to be a promising candidate to reduce the severity of OWS [ [60](#B60-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. [61](#B61-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)], have been previously demonstrated. Animal studies using different models of pain (hot-plate, formalin, tail-pinch, and acetic acid-induced writhing tests) or inflammation (carrageenan-induced paw oedema) have confirmed the dose-dependent efficacy of Nigella sativa oil and thymoquinone after systemic or local administration [ [62](#B62-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [63](#B63-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Additionally, a small clinical trial reported the successful use of N. sativa in treating opioid dependence. Subjects received 500 mg N. sativa orally, three times per day, and reported significantly reduced OWS. Additionally, the results also indicated that N. sativa can be safely used in the long-term treatment of opioid addiction [ [64](#B64-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. However, in order to correctly evaluate the efficacy of N. sativa in opioid addiction, further evidence was necessary. Repeated morphine administration stimulated malondialdehyde expression (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) production, and oxidative reduced intracellular glutathione (GSH) expression and glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. To investigate the effects on morphine-induced tolerance and dependence, mice were administered N. sativa oil or thymoquinone and morphine. This co-administration reduced the development of morphine tolerance and dependence and explains the possible mechanisms involved in the brain, as the oil, through thymoquinone, prevents both upregulation of MDA expression, NO overproduction, and oxidative stress, and the reduction of GSH and GSH-PX after repeated morphine administration [ [65](#B65-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [66](#B66-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Similar effects were observed in mice after tramadol and N. sativa oil co-administration [ [67](#B67-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)], but this also reduced tramadol-induced hepato- and [ [68](#B68-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. By using opioid receptor expressing U87 glioblastoma cells, it has been demonstrated that thymoquinone decreased intracellular cAMP concentration after chronic morphine treatment, preventing opioid tolerance and dependence [ [69](#B69-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Repeated tramadol administration induces apoptotic cell death through oxidative stress and cell damage in the brain tissue. The oil prevented tramadol-induced ultrastructural apoptotic changes in the motor cerebral cortex of rats by protecting the cortical neurons and myelinated axons, thereby confirming its therapeutic potential in treating opioid dependence [ [70](#B70-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Furthermore, thymoquinone also prevents epileptic seizures and consequent neurodegeneration through the interaction with GABA receptors [ [71](#B71-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [72](#B72-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)] and it was found to attenuate OWS by clocking the calcium channels [ [73](#B73-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [74](#B74-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. A growing body of evidence suggests that N. sativa oil and its main component, thymoquinone, are effective and can be safely used, not only during the opioid withdrawal phase but also as therapeutic alternatives in long-term treatment of opioid addiction. [20](#B20-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [75](#B75-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Advances in nanotechnological drug delivery formulations have improved the therapeutic efficacy of numerous drugs, including essential oils. An optimized nanoemulsion from micellar nanoparticles of eucalyptus oil demonstrated high central and peripheral analgesic activity in rats [ [76](#B76-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. In addition, patients who inhaled eucalyptus oil after a total knee replacement surgery described less pain after the surgery and had lower blood pressure [ [77](#B77-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Taken together, eucalyptus essential oil and its main active component, 1,8-cineol, have proved to be promising candidates in pain management. [78](#B78-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [79](#B79-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [80](#B80-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)], and a synergistic effect of co-administration of ginger extract with morphine has been established [ [81](#B81-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Additionally, ginger extract also reduced the expression levels of proteins involved in neuroinflammation (glial fibrillary acidic protein and p38 mitogen-activated nucleus accumbens, caused by chronic morphine administration [ [82](#B82-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Patients with moderate to severe knee pain, who were administered ginger and orange essential oils topically (through massage therapy), reported only short-term pain relief [ [83](#B83-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. However, patients with knee osteoarthritis, who received standardized ginger (25 mg) and echinacea (5 mg) supplements for 30 days against inflammation and chronic pain, reported an improvement of pain and quality of life as well as a reduction in knee circumference [ [84](#B84-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Additionally, the use of lavender oil in obese patients after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding reduced their post-operative opioid demand [ [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. However, lavender oil showed no significant effect in reducing pain after open-heart surgery or spinal procedures, but it did reduce patients' anxiety levels [ [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [85](#B85-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. An animal model of inflammatory and neuropathic pain provides new information on the underlying mechanisms of action of lavender oil in pain management. The results indicate that inhalation of lavender oil reduces hyperalgesia and inflammation by activating the opioid receptors and cannabinoid receptor 2 [ [21](#B21-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Taken together, these data indicate the benefits of aromatherapy combined with other nonpharmacological and/or pharmacological treatments in pain management. 5. Conclusions and Future Perspectives [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-15-01387-t001)), making them perfect candidates to be used as adjuvants in pain management. Nigella sativa and its main compound thymoquinone also have a proven potential in long-term treatment of opioid dependence. These results indicate that N. sativa oil and T. vulgaris oil could be safely used in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms and those who are suffering from opioid dependence. [86](#B86-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. [87](#B87-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [88](#B88-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that their readiness to use aromatherapy is high. Currently, there are multiple dietary supplements available on the market that promise to boost the immune system or relieve pain. While, for some of them, scientific data are available to support these claims, many others lack scientific evidence. As more and more people are turning to alternative medicine as adjuvant therapies, it is necessary to ensure that they have access only to medicines that are efficient in alleviating their discomfort and available in adequate formulations to assure the therapeutic efficacy. This is a reason why essential oils that have already been investigated in preclinical and small clinical trials should be further analyzed in combination with approved pharmacological therapies, to establish their efficacy. Hand-held, portable inhalators, initially developed for asthma and other related symptoms, could be easily used to release essential oils into the nose. While some clinical trials support the effectiveness of essential oils and aromatherapy, others do not [ [89](#B89-pharmaceuticals-15-01387), [90](#B90-pharmaceuticals-15-01387)]. Thus, well-designed randomized clinical trials must be performed to prove their efficacy. The combination of aromatherapy with modern devices utilizing pharmaceutical technology has the potential to ease the disease burden described here.
