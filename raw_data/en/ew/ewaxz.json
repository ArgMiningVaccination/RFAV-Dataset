Examples include the characteristics of the disease and how it impacts on different groups of individuals as a function of sex, age or socioeconomic status, its transmission mode, or the demographic structure of the affected population. Here we introduce a compartmental model of infection propagation with vaccination and reinfection and analyse the effect that variations on the rates of these two processes have on the progression of the disease and on the number of fatalities. The population is split into two groups to highlight the overall effects on disease caused by different relationships between vaccine administration and various demographic structures. We show that optimal administration protocols depend on the vaccination rate, a variable severely conditioned by vaccine supply and acceptance. As a practical example, we study COVID-19 dynamics in various countries using real demographic data. The model can be easily applied to any other disease and demographic structure through a suitable estimation of parameter values. Simulations of the general model can be carried out at [this interactive webpage][1] [[1][2]]. Author summary Vaccination campaigns can have varying degrees of success in minimizing the effects of an infectious disease. It is often very difficult to assess a priori the importance and effect of different relevant factors. To gain insight into this problem, we present a model of infection propagation with vaccination and use it to study the effects of vaccination rate and population structure. We find that when the disease affects in different ways distinct population groups, the best vaccination strategy depends non-trivially on the rate at which vaccines can be administered. The application of our analysis to COVID-19 reveals that, in countries with aged populations, the best strategy is always to vaccinate first the elderly, while for youthful populations maximizing vaccination rate regardless of other considerations may save more lives. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This study was funded by grants PID2020-113284GB-C21 (I.A., S.M.) and BADS (PID2019-109320GB-100, S.A.) funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033.

Yes I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals. Yes I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance). Yes I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.
