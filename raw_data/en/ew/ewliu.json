Different theories to understand various aspects that influence the [purusha](/index.php?title=Purusha) are postulated, such as those of [atma](/index.php?title=Atma) (spirit), swabhava (nature), Prajapati (creator), and Kala (time). After considering all these postulations, it is concluded that the same factors that are responsible for the origin of humans are responsible for diseases too. The wholesome diet is responsible for proper growth and development of holistic human being, while the unwholesome diet for diseases. The most commonly applicable wholesome (and unwholesome) diet is discussed with examples. A specific collection called agrya samgraha (collection of definitive and first choice of medication or treatment) is introduced. In all, one hundred fifty-six drugs and therapies have been enumerated in this chapter. Also ingredients used in 84 naturally fermented preparations named 'asava' that help in strengthening the patient's mind, body and digestive power (agni) are listed. Keywords: [Purusha](/index.php?title=Purusha) (conscious beings - humans, souls, etc.), agrya samgraha (foremost collection/formulation/medication applicable), hitakara, ahitakara, wholesome, unwholesome, asava (alcoholic preparations). Introduction This chapter discusses various theories (regarding the origin of [Purusha](/index.php?title=Purusha) as well as the diseases that afflict him) postulated by ten sages (or scholars) under the aegis of Lord Punarvasu Atreya - providing insights into the various aspects that influence the shaping of the being, and also the origin of the ailments or disorders that afflict it. Kashipati Vamaka initiated the discussions with a query about the origin of human beings and disease, followed by Maudagalya Parikshi (on [atma](/index.php?title=Atma) theory), Sharaloma (on kala theory). Lord Punarvasu Atreya concluded the discussions by stating that the same factors that are responsible for the origin and growth of human beings can cause diseases also. This chapter is closely associated with the third chapter of [Sharira Sthana](/index.php?title=Sharira_Sthana) (Khuddika garbhavakranti), which provides additional insights into the origins of human beings. Considering the health of human beings, dietary articles that are beneficial and harmful have been provided in this chapter with relevant examples. The first choices in medication, the best factors in various categories, and suggested lifestyle have been grouped into a category named agrya samgraha. Also, Lord Atreya answers Agnivesha's query about asava (alcoholic preparations) with an elaborate explanation of eighty-four types of asava, categorized by parts of herbs used in their preparation. Thus, this chapter provided an introduction to food and beverages that are beneficial to health. Sanskrit text, Transliteration and English Translation expound the chapter \"Yajjah Purushiya\" (Origin of Human Beings and the best things for life). Thus said Lord Atreya [1-2] Symposium on origin of [purusha](/index.php?title=Purusha) The objective of great sages (thinkers) assembled before Lord Punarvasu (Atreya), who had directly perceived and realized all knowledge. A discussion arose about the determination of the truth of the primal origin of [Purusha](/index.php?title=Purusha) (an aggregate of soul, senses, psyche and sense objects) and the origin of the diseases. [3-4] Query by Kashipati Vamaka the king of Kashi, who was learned in the science of the subject (medicine), approached the assembly of the sages (learned persons/exponents in various subject matters) and put the following questions. \"Oh sirs! What is the truth? Do diseases originate from the same source, which is also the origin of humans? Is it truth or otherwise?\" In this reference, Lord Punarvasu addressing the sages said as follows- \"You all sages are enlightened and have broad knowledge. Your doubts have been cleared by your unlimited knowledge of science. You are capable of resolving the doubts raised by the king of Kashi.\" [5-7] The opinion of Maudgalya Parikshi Parikshit formulated his answer first. He said \"Human being is born of [Atma](/index.php?title=Atma) (spirit) and like that all the diseases are born of [atma](/index.php?title=Atma). The spirit is the source of all things. The [atma](/index.php?title=Atma) acquires the actions and enjoys the merits of action as the fruit of actions. In the absence of this [atma](/index.php?title=Atma), there is no activity either pleasurable or painful. [8-9] The opinion of Sharaloma as Sattvaja [Purusha](/index.php?title=Purusha) (mind Sharaloma said, \"No. This is not correct, because [atma](/index.php?title=Atma) dislikes pain naturally and, therefore, would never repress itself with disease and other types of pain. The [manas](/index.php?title=Manas)(mind), influenced by rajas and tamas, which is also called sattva, is the real cause of the origin of the body and its afflictions, both.\"[10-11] The opinion of Varyovida as views of Sharaloma. He said,\"No! Manas (mind) alone is not the cause of the origin of both (human and disease) because, without the body, there can neither be any somatic disease nor mind will get existence. All creatures (animates) originate from rasa (fluid), and so are the various types of diseases. Rasas originate from water and, therefore, water is ascribed as the source of their manifestations.\" [12-13] The opinion of Hiranyaksha as Shad-dhatuja Varyovida, Hiranyaksha said, \"No! It is not right. Human beings are born neither from the atman, nor rasa (fluids) nor even the super-sensual mind because there are some diseases caused due to sense objects (such as sound) as well. Human is the result of shad-dhatu (six elements, including panchamahabuta or the five elements, and atman). Diseases also arise from those six elements. This is the principle of Samkhya philosophy. This type of constitution is also referred to as Rashi Purusha. [14-15] The opinion of his views, sage Kaushika said, \"No, This is not true. How can the six elements create an individual without any role of the father and the mother? A human is born of a human (parents), the cow is born of cows, and the horse is born of horses. Diseases such as prameha (obstinate urinary diseases), and various other diseases, are considered to be hereditary. Therefore, the father and the mother (parents) are the origin of the humans and also the diseases. [16-17] The opinion of Bhadrakapya as Karmaja [Purusha](/index.php?title=Purusha) (deeds in above views and said, \"No. This is not true because blind children are not born to blind parents. Parents themselves also are not born before the creation. Therefore, human beings, as well as the diseases, originate from the deeds performed in past life. Without karma (past action or deeds) neither human beings nor their diseases could have been created. [18-19] The opinion of Bharadwaja as Svabhavaja sage Bharadwaja said, \"No, this is not true. For the doer always precedes the deeds. There is no deed performed without the presence of the doer. Nor any human being is born as a result only of deeds. The intrinsic nature alone (svabhava) is the cause of the existence of living beings and their diseases just as roughness (khara), fluidity (drava), mobility (chalatva) and heat (ushnatva) are respectively the intrinsic nature (or svabhava) of prithvi, apa, vayu and tejas.\"[ 20-21] The Kankayana said, \"No, such an effort would be fruitless. Things would either get accomplished or not get accomplished by the course of nature. The son of Brahma, Prajapati, who possesses infinite creative powers, is the origin of living beings as well as non-living things, happiness as well as misery\".[22-23] The opinion of Bhikshu Atreya as not true. Prajapati (the Lord of Creation) always seeks the well-being of all of the creation. So he would never bring misery to his creations, like some cruel friend??. Human beings and their diseases are caused by time (kala) because the whole universe is under control of kala. Kala is the origin of all. [22-25] Explanation and Decision by Punarvasu Atreya the course of such a controversial and sensitive discussion involving such eminent sages, Lord Punarvasu stated, \" Please do not dispute over this matter, O Sages! It is difficult to arrive at the whole truth in this debate considering only partial aspects. Those who argue and counter argue over points go on circumventing without reaching any conclusion, like a person who operates an oil press. Therefore, let us avoid this war of words and put our collective minds to arrive at the truth. One cannot attain any true knowledge without clearing the obscuring cloud or the darkness of ignorance. The fact is that the same elements, whose wholesome combination gives rise to the well-being of human beings, bring about various kinds of diseases when combined in an unwholesome manner. [26-29] Origin of disease Second query by Lord Atreya, Kashipati Vamaka again asked, \"Sir, what is the cause of the growth of human beings who are born with wholesome combination and diseases which are born of unwholesome combinations? [30] Reply by Atreya- Cause of growth of human being and diseases - , [] replied to him, \"Ingesting wholesome food is the only cause of the nourishment of [Purusha](/index.php?title=Purusha), and unwholesome diet is the cause of diseases.\" [31] Wholesome and unwholesome things for holistic human being Query by Agnivesha - Agnivesha asked, \"Sir, How shall we distinguish correctly between wholesome and unwholesome diets? Because, in practice, we find that the articles of diet that are described to be wholesome and unwholesome produce opposite results by variation of dose (quantity ), time (meal time, season), a method of preparation, location, constitution of the body, the predominant [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) and the age of an individual. [32]. Explanation by Those food articles that maintain an equilibrium state in body elements ( [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu)) and help in eliminating abnormalities or disturbances in the path to equilibrium can be considered as wholesome food articles, while those that act in the opposite manner are considered unwholesome. This would be the most accurate description of wholesome and unwholesome food articles. [33] Query of Agnivesha - stated this, Agnivesha said, \"Sir, the definition which is thus propounded will not be comprehended by all kinds of physicians.\" [34] Explanation by Lord Atreya - ! , Agnivesha), \"Oh Agnivesha! Those physicians only, who have the knowledge of the science of dietetics (or the knowledge of dravya) including the knowledge of properties, actions, contents of food articles, dosage, etc. would prefer to learn from instructions imparted in this (comprehensive) manner. We shall now explain the various specifications of food articles for the understanding of such physicians. It is not possible to explain the dosages of the food articles as their variations (preparations in various forms etc.) are too many according to specification. Variations in the specific rules related to diet and dietary articles utilized in them will be explained with relevant examples in detail and brief (as per the need).[35] The classification of food - ; , ; ,; , ; , food is as follows: Food is all of one kind in the view of eatability as a common feature. According to the source, food articles are of two types - those based on vegetable sources and those that are based on animal products. It is also of two types based on specific action: actions that have a positive effect and actions that have an unhealthy, unwholesome, or negative effect. Food can also be classified into four groups by the way it is ingested: drinkables, eatables, chewables, and linctuses. Another method of classification categorizes food by taste - and these are six categories. Similarly, from the point of view of their texture or properties, food articles are twenty types : heavy, light, cold, hot, unctuous, dry, slow (dull), sharp, stable, fluidity, soft, hard, clear, viscid, refined, smooth, rough, subtle, gross, dense (or solid) and liquid. Thus, classifications of food can be countless due to the sheer diversity of ingredients, combinations and their preparations. [36] Two main classes of diet Nevertheless, we shall now delve upon certain classes of food articles that are mostly commonly used and are naturally the most wholesome and unwholesome to the majority of human beings. [37] Wholesome(beneficial) are thus: Red rice (Oryza Sativa Linn.) is the best among all cereal crops having bristles, green gram (phascolus mungalim) among pulses, rain water (collected directly before falling on ground) among various types of drinking water, rock salt among salts, jiwanti (Leptadenia reticulate W.S.A.) among pot herbs, antelope (ena) among meat of animals, common quail (lava) among meat of birds, the iguana (godha) among meat of burrowing animals, rohita among fishes, cow ghee among ghee, cow milk among milk, the tila (sesame) oil among fats of vegetable sources, lard (hog's fat) among the fats of marshy animals, fat of chuluki (gangetic dolphin) among fish fat, the fat of pakahamsa (white swan) among fats of aquatic birds, the fat of hen among fats of gallinaceous types of birds, the fat of goat among fats of branch-eating animals, ginger among rhizomes and roots, grapes among fruits, and sugar among the products of sugarcane. In this manner, various natural food articles have been identified to be the most wholesome in their class. [38] Unwholesome (harmful) food most unwholesome of food articles: Yavak (wild barley) is the most unwholesome among cereal crops with bristles, masha (phaseolus radiations linn) among pulses, river water in the rainy season among types of drinking water, ushara (saline soil salt) among salts, mustard leaf among pot herbs, beef among meat of animals, young dove (kapota) among meat of birds, frog meat among meat of burrowing animals, chilichima meat among meat of fishes, ghee made of sheep's milk among ghee, sheep milk among milk, oil of kusumbha (Canthamus finctorious liom) among vegetable fats, fat of the water buffalo among fats of marshy animals, fat of gangetic gharial (kumbhira) among the fats of fishes, the fat of water foul among fats of aquatic animal, fat of the sparrow (chatak) among fats of gallinaceous types of bird, fat of elephant among fats of branch-eating animals, the nikucha (Atrocarpus nikucha Roxb.) among fruits, the aluka among the bulbs, phanita (treacle) among derivatives of sugarcane, etc. These above (mentioned food articles) have been enumerated, each of which is the most unwholesome of its class naturally. The wholesome food articles and unwholesome food articles have been explained in such context. [39] Agrya samgraha (collections of best food articles, factors and drugs in various conditions) | - to the above mentioned food articles, the table below provides a ready reference of key food articles and Ayurvedic therapies and their superior qualities: |1. Food is said - The foremost in their class, one hundred and fifty-two varieties of the best drug, regimen, etc. have been explained as enumerated above. These are sufficient for guiding treatment of various diseases. [41] Use in therapeutics provided a detailed list of dietary preparations and therapies having superior qualities that keep a person healthy. The most effective medicines to pacify [vata](/index.php?title=Vata), [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) are described. A skillful physician should prescribe the right dietary regimen and therapy after gaining a thorough understanding of the qualities of these articles. Only then does he attain his dharma(duties) and kama(all desires) [42-44] Pathya articles and activities that do not adversely affect the body systems and are liked by the mind are regarded as pathya (wholesome). Likewise, dietary articles and activities that adversely affect the body system and are disliked by the mind are regarded as unwholesome. This is, however, not a cardinal rule, and food articles and drugs do have a variety of effects depending on the dosage, time, mode of preparation, geographical location, the body constitution of the patient, and [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha). Hence, the physician who desires success in treatment shall consider effects of the natural properties of drugs and dietary articles, as well as the usage patterns associated with such articles. [45-47]. Agnivesha's query regarding asava (self generated above statement of the Lord Atreya, Agnivesha once again asked Lord Atreya, \"O Lord, this subject has been dealt with exhaustively as proposed and we have followed it too. Now we would like to hear from you a detailed and precise description of the ingredients that get into asava (alcoholic) preparations.\"[48] Explanation by Atreya about asava (self generated fermented alcoholic preparation) - ! | | - ,- , ,- , , , to him, \"O Agnivesha! In brief there are eight types of ingredients that are used in alcoholic preparations: grains, fruits, roots, pith, flowers, branches, leaves, and barks. The ninth additive is sugar. Asava is innumerable because there could be innumerable combinations of ingredients and methods for preparation. However, 84 asavas are regarded very wholesome: - Dhanyasava (alcoholic preparation from grain): There are six alcoholic preparations from fruits from which phalasava (alcoholic preparations using fruit) are prepared. - Mulasava (alcoholic preparation from roots): There are eleven mulasava (alcoholic preparations made by root). The roots Indica). The pulp or sara of these twenty trees are considered to be ideal for preparation of asava. - Pushpasava (alcoholic preparation from flowers): Padma woodfordia fruticosa kurz). These flowers are considered suitable for making pushpasava. - Kandasava (alcoholic preparation from stem): Ikshu (Sugar pundraka (white Sugercane). The kanda (stem) of these four plants are considered ideal for making kandasava (alcoholic preparation of stem). - Patrasava (alcoholic preparation from Borassus flabellifer lin). The leaves of these two plants are considered best suited for preparation of patrasava (alcoholic preparation from leaves). - Twagasava these four trees are used for making twagasava (alcoholic preparations from barks). - Sharakarasava (alcoholic preparation from sugar): Sugar is the only one thing from which sharakarasava (sugar wine) is prepared. Using each of these ingredients exclusively (i.e., without mixing or combining with any other additive or ingredient) results in eighty four varieties of alcoholic preparations. All these are known as asava (self generated alcoholic preparation) because of the process of fermentation involved in their preparation. The outcome or result of these asavas (alcoholic preparations) is based on the combination, properties of ingredients and the process or method of preparation. Thus, a skillful Ayurvedic practitioner proficient in the art of preparing asavas should be able to concoct a preparation with the right combination of ingredients, depending upon the doshas of the patient, his physical constitution, time, season, location, and other factors [48-49] Beneficial effects of asava is the verse, again - The eighty four types of best alcoholic preparations have been enumerated that strengthen the mind, body and digestive power. Such preparations dispel insomnia, depression, anorexia and induce exhilaration. [50] - In this chapter titled [Yajjah Purushiya](/index.php?title=Yajjah_Purushiya) (Origin of the Human Being), sages debated upon the origin of human being and diseases with different thoughts on the topic. Finally, Lord Atreya presented his view on the most wholesome and unwholesome food articles (eatables as well as beverages). [51] Tattva Vimarsha (Fundamental Principles) Multiple factors (fluid), shad dhatu deeds), swabhava (nature), prajapati (Creator), and kala (time) have been considered as the source of creation of the purusha (human beings). The same factors are considered responsible for origin of diseases. - In order to sustain health, one shall follow a wholesome diet and restrain from following unwholesome diets and activities. - The best things shall be used as first choice in various respective conditions (samgraha). - Those food articles that help maintain a state of equilibrium among body elements ( [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu)) and also help in eliminating imbalances that could occur due to abnormalities are considered to be wholesome food articles, while those articles that act in an opposite manner are unwholesome articles. - Classification of food articles could be done by their suitability for consumption, source (vegetarian or non-vegetarian), effects on body (wholesome or unwholesome), mode of consumption (to eat, to drink, to chew or to lick), six tastes and twenty ( [guna](/index.php?title=Guna)) qualities. There could be innumerable combinations. - Dietary preparations and drugs that do not affect the body system adversely, and those that are liked by the mind are considered pathya (wholesome). Likewise, those that adversely affect the body system and are disliked by the mind are considered apathya (unwholesome). - Drugs and food articles are also considered wholesome or unwholesome depending upon the dose (measure), time, mode of preparation, habitat of the drugs or food articles, body constitution, and [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha). - Asava (alcoholic preparation, wine) are prepared by the process of fermentation. Combinations possible for preparing asava are unlimited. - The effect of asava depends upon the combination and properties of ingredients used, as well as the process or method of preparation, duration of fermentation (time), place of preparation, mode of preservation, quantity etc. - Asavas help in strengthening the mind, body and digestive power. Such preparations dispel insomnia, depression, anorexia and induce exhilaration. Vidhi Vimarsha (Applied Inferences) - An Ayurvedic practitioner proficient in therapeutics, dietetics, or preparation of the various forms of asava should know the properties and attributes of all ingredients, as well as the expected effects of the preparation of the said drug. - Of the innumerable combinations of food articles and beverages, 152 forms of eatables and therapies, and 84 forms of alcoholic beverages are known to be wholesome. As per Lord Atreya, wholesome foods are the key source of creation of the purusha, and unwholesome food of diseases. - Food and physical regimen that are beneficial to the body and mind are called pathya and those that are harmful are called apathya. - A food or beverage's therapeutic properties also depend upon quantity, season, way of preparation, soil, place and [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha). - 84 types of asava (fermented products), contain probiotics and have effect on body, mind and digestive power are listed indicating gut brain relationship. They help in regulation of sleep, appetite and mental activity. Wholesome and unwholesome factors for holistic human being Diet and lifestyle habits can favorably or adversely impact the development of holistic human being ( [purusha](/index.php?title=Purusha)). Therefore, wholesome dietary and lifestyle factors are described in this chapter. A list of unwholesome dietary factors that can play role in etiopathogenesis of a disease is also given. Both are equally important in providing healthcare to an individual. Classification of dietary articles and its utility The best and worst food items in categories of cereals, pulses, milk, meat classes, oils, vegetables etc. are described based upon their beneficial and harmful effects on human biology. The beneficial food items can be used judiciously for health preservation and prevention of diseases. Agrya sangraha: A ready to use index in healthcare Agrya samgraha is an index of all items that are beneficial in healthcare management. It includes a description of actions of various food preparations (aharavikara), medicines (aushadha), and associated factors (anubandhini). It is imperative to note that when more than one action (karma) is attributed to one factor, it is describing the collective action and not each action separately. The pharmacological activity profiles of dietary, medicinal and lifestyle factors can be easily referred from the list. Vagbhata focuses on specific dravya and its action in a particular disease.[A.Hr. Uttara Tantra 40] [[1]](#cite_note-Hridaya-1) Superiority attributed in the list is relative to other materials (dravya) having similar actions. Some examples are given below. The following table extends description of articles listed in agrya samgraha [Gangadhara on Cha.Sa.

[Chikitsa Sthana](/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana)22/45] Classification of Agrya Dravya The 152 entities can be better understood by categorizing them into these 6 sets. - Wholesome substances for both healthy and patients (swasthaturahita drayva).Eg: Food, Water, Milk, Meat, etc. - Wholesome actions for both healthy and patients (swasthaturahita karma).Eg: Emesis, acidissima (kapittha), Ghee of sheep milk etc. - Food articles that are wholesome for patients (aturahita anna).Eg: Milk of goat, Milk of Buffalo, Sugarcane juice, etc. - Medicines that are wholesome for A group of actions which are either wholesome or unwholesome (hita/ ahita karma)Eg: Suppression of natural urges (vega sandharanam), timely intake of food (kalabhojanam) etc. Pathyam (wholesomeness) Pathyam is another term for wholesomeness (hitam). The definition of pathya encompasses both body and mind (good for the body and pleasing for the mind). The wholesomeness of a substance/activity is in terms of the final effect that it brings about in the body and not in its immediate or local effect. For example, the use of bitter medicines is not pleasing for the mind when advised in fever (jvara), but when it cures the fever (jvara), the final result becomes pleasing for the mind. Thus, while advising pathya, it is necessary to counsel the patient to ensure patient compliance. In healthy, the wholesomeness can definitely be attributed to certain articles, but in patients, the wholesomeness of a particular substance is to be evaluated against various factors like the state of the disease, season, the quantity, etc. For example, though water in moderate quantity is pathya in healthy, it is forbidden in diseases like anemia (pandu), ascites (udara), piles (arsha) etc. Further research area It is required here that some researches on scientific ground to support the views and concepts of this chapter, which is very unique and practical.
