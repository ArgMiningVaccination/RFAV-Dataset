This ambitious effort might be wasted if the public heeds the [warnings of critics](http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/naturopathy.html) that naturopathy is [devoid of medicine](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/nd-confession-part-1-clinical-training-inside-and-out/) and abounds with [dangerous and unethical practices](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/is-there-a-naturopathic-standard-of-care/). Ozone therapy is one such case of unsafe quackery that is endorsed by the naturopathic profession. Naturopaths claim that ozone, a highly reactive gas, can be used to treat a plethora of serious medical conditions, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes and HIV infection. But ozone is extremely poisonous. It is an unstable molecule that reacts aggressively with biological compounds to form free radicals\u2014the ultimate threat to health that alternative medicine zealots warn about. To be sure, the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRsearch.cfm?fr=801.415) has unequivocally concluded that \"ozone is a toxic gas with no known useful medical application.\" Yet, in naturopathic medicine, and even among some integrative medical doctors, ozone therapy is publicly touted as a panacea that has grabbed the attention of concerned citizens. A source who wishes to remain anonymous reported to me that complaints had been filed in May 2016 against a total of 55 licensed naturopaths in Oregon and California who had advertised ozone therapy on their websites. Posing as a prospective patient, the complainant had called many of the offending naturopathic practices to confirm that ozone therapies are used. The complaints document that the most common type of ozone therapy used is major autohemotherapy, in which blood from the patient is drained into an IV bag, mixed with ozone gas and re-injected into the bloodstream. Other routes of administration documented in the filings include using a catheter to insert ozone vaginally and rectally, which has been featured in naturopathic peer-reviewed literature. In a 2014 [article published](http://ndnr.com/neurology/ozone-therapy-an-effective-solution-for-acute-and-chronic-pain/) in Naturopathic Doctor News and Review, the flagship journal of naturopathic physicians, Bryan Rade, N.D., characterizes ozone as a \"safe, inexpensive and effective clinical tool with a wide range of therapeutic applications.\" He goes on document how ozone gas can be mixed into a patient's blood, injected into joints and muscles, inhaled or put into the bladder, rectum or vagina. Ozone therapy is even taught at some of the accredited naturopathic schools and elsewhere by their faculty members. In July 2016, Bastyr University, one of the most prominent naturopathic training institutions, hosted a [weekend course](https://www.bastyr.edu/civicrm/event/info?id=2052&reset=1), in which chiropractor Dennis Harper taught how to use ozone gas on patients. Bastyr's very own director of intravenous therapy, Brenden Cochran, N.D., has continued to teach [online seminars](http://www.keycompounding.com/providers/webinars/webinar-ozone-injections-and-other-agents/) on ozone injections. He claims that \"ozone injections provide an effective way a [sic] killing chronic infections and stabilizing painful joints.\" The AANP and naturopathic state associations have approved Cochran's courses for continuing education credits that naturopaths are required to complete to maintain licensure. Medical doctors have long expressed grave concern for patients receiving such treatments. In 1994, [Stanley Feldman](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/health-fears-over-doctors-use-of-ozone-1420612.html), professor of anesthesia at Charing Cross Westminster Medical School, said, [\"Injecting ozone seems to me to be an absolutely lethal thing to do.\"](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fbrittmariehermes%2F2016%2F10%2F13%2Fnaturopathic-medicine-week-endemic-quackery-ozone-therapy%2F&text=%E2%80%9CInjecting%20ozone%20seems%20to%20me%20to%20be%20an%20absolutely%20lethal%20thing%20to%20do.%E2%80%9D) The widely trusted [Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database](http://naturaldatabase.therapeuticresearch.com) classifies ozone therapy as \"likely unsafe,\" which means that there is enough reliable clinical evidence showing significant adverse outcomes. Its summary concludes there is not enough evidence to rate ozone therapy as effective for any medical condition. The complaints against the 55 licensed naturopaths practicing ozone therapy correctly reference that ozone is not a substance approved by the naturopathic regulatory boards in Oregon or California. Yet given the poor track records of any state naturopathic board to protect the public against health fraud, these 55 practitioners are unlikely to face appropriate discipline. Two cases highlight the flaccid actions naturopaths have taken against their own. In 2013, John Catanzaro, N.D. faced disciplinary action by the Washington state Board of Naturopathy for collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars from cancer patients in exchange for bogus vaccines that he made from their urine. Having previously been fined for illegally prescribing drugs in 2007, [some expected](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/warrenthrockmorton/2014/11/18/john-catanzaros-naturopath-license-suspended-can-apply-for-reinstatement-in-january-2015/) his license to be permanently revoked. Instead, he served a one-year suspension and had to [repay $180,750](http://www.casewatch.org/board/nat/catanzaro/agreed_order_2014.shtml) to the patients who did not receive his concoctions, in addition to paying a $5,000 fine and being put on probation for eight years. Catanzaro has moved onto a dubious genetic testing business called [Health Coach 7](https://www.healthcoach7.com/about-us/). In 2014, I reported Michael Uzick, N.D. to the Arizona state Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board for importing and selling a rogue chemotherapeutic drug called Ukrain that is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Uzick's patients had advanced and aggressive cancers, for which some of their medical oncologists had discharged them from their care. But in response to this gross violation of state and federal law, the board issued Uzick a [letter of reprimand](http://directorynd.az.gov/agency/pages/directorySearchDetail.asp?holderID=102) without having to pay fines, to reimburse the tens of thousands of dollars he charged individual patients or to accept restrictions on his license. [Ozone therapy is at the same level of quackery as fake cancer vaccines made from urine and illegal cancer drugs imported from overseas.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fbrittmariehermes%2F2016%2F10%2F13%2Fnaturopathic-medicine-week-endemic-quackery-ozone-therapy%2F&text=Ozone%20therapy%20is%20quackery%2C%20like%20fake%20cancer%20vaccines%20made%20from%20urine%20%26%20illegal%20cancer%20drugs%20imported%20from%20overseas.) The public should remain doubtful that naturopathic regulators will act commensurately. The [American Association of Naturopathic Physicians](http://www.naturopathic.org/ev_calendar_day.asp?date=12/1/2015&eventid=14), [Oregon Board of Naturopathic Medicine](https://www.oregon.gov/obnm/CEPage/2016CEByDate.pdf) and [California Naturopathic Doctors Association](http://web.archive.org/web/20150907045138/http://www.calnd.org/pw28) had previously accepted ozone therapy online seminars taught by Brenden Cochran, N.D., among others, as acceptable continuing education credits in pharmacology. Rebecca Mitchell, the executive officer of the California Naturopathic Medicine Committee, wrote in an email to my source that the same medical experts who work for the Medical Board of California and the Osteopathic Medical Board of California will review the ozone therapy complaints. She explained that the timeframe of enforcement cases can range from several months to years. Ahead of the ozone complaints, it seems, California naturopaths who were practicing ozone therapy had been warned. [Setarah Tais, N.D.](http://fresnoholisticmedicine.com/about/dr-setareh-tais-nd/), former president of the California Naturopathic Doctors Association, wrote in a mass email in December 2015 that members should scrub their websites of treatments that fall within \"gray areas\" of the scope of practice; she specifically mentioned ozone therapy. She did not respond to a request to comment for this article. In her mass email, Tais cautioned that \"any complaints against our members could be damaging to the progress of [expanding our scope of practice].\" That political forewarning didn't seem to matter. Tais was referring to the naturopathic \"Scope Modernization Bill,\" [SB 538](http://www.forbes.com/sites/brittmariehermes/2016/08/17/are-california-lawmakers-gullible-enough-to-allow-naturopaths-to-prescribe-drugs), that would have indefensibly allowed naturopaths to prescribe drugs without physician oversight.
