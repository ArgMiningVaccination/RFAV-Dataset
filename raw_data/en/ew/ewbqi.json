Nancy Goodman, Executive Director and Founder After the death of her ten-year-old son Jacob, to cancer, Nancy Goodman founded Kids v Cancer and successfully championed the passage of two federal laws: the pediatric priority review voucher program in 2012 and the RACE for Children Act in 2017. The pediatric priority review voucher program creates a financial incentive for rare pediatric disease drug development - vouchers that are currently trading at around $100 million and that constitute a significant incentive. The RACE for Children Act authorizes the FDA to direct newly developed cancer drug to have pediatric studies through phase 2 when the molecular target of the drug in development is relevant to pediatrics. In 2022, Goodman is championing the Give Kids a Chance Act to authorize the FDA to direct newly developed cancer drugs to have pediatric studies of those drugs in combination with other cancer therapies. Goodman was a member of the U.S. Vice President's Blue Ribbon Pediatric Oncology Panel for the Cancer Moonshot and the National Cancer Institute Board of Scientific Counselors. Goodman and Kids v Cancer have been awarded the Fast Company Magazine as top ten most innovative nonprofits, the Peter Drucker Nonprofit Innovation Award, the American Association of Cancer Research Distinguished Advocacy Award, and the US Food and Drug Administration Group Recognition Award.

Clinical mentors Each Invent at Seattle Children's scholar will have the opportunity to have a clinical mentor with deep experience in the disease that is central to the scholar's research. Ideally, clinical mentors will help the scholar connect with colleagues regarding tissue bank resources, clinical trial networks, and preclinical models. Clinical mentors will help scholars understand current standard of care, emerging therapeutics that are in clinical development, unmet medical needs for patients, and which therapeutic modalities would or would not be acceptable to families. In some cases, clinical mentors may help arrange clinic shadowing opportunities or participation in discussions with patient families outside the hospital setting (for example, advocacy summits). Clinical mentors will typically be recruited from the more than 1,200 pediatricians and pediatric specialists in the Seattle Children's network. "}
