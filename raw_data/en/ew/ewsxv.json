Who Is Vianna Stibal? She is the founder of the ThetaHealing method and a well-known spiritual teacher and healer who teaches her spiritual philosophy and type of meditation, i.e. ThetaHealing worldwide. Witnessing her own healing two decades ago, she found that our beliefs and emotions influence us on a core, history, genetic, and soul level.

Until now, Stibal has trained more than 500,000 practitioners throughout the world and has written several books as well. How Does ThetaHealing Work? According to Stibal, the purpose of this teaching is to bring your brain in a deep state known as theta and through it, to renew the link with the Creator, which will further allow you to learn how to ease mental, physical, and emotional shifts. What's more, she shows you how to build your own reality and how everything that happens in your life is with a purpose. According to [Theta Alchemy,](https://www.thetaalchemy.com/what-is-theta-healing/) our brains have 5 basic frequencies, that is, Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta, and Delta and we usually use them one at a time; however, one frequency tends to be dominant, depending on the situation. In the phase of deep meditation, sleep, or hypnosis, the dominant wave is the Theta one and scientists have concluded that this frequency has the ability to lower stress and anxiety, lead to deep relaxation, enhance the mental clarity and creativity, minimize ache, and increase euphoria. During ThetaHealing, the brain enters this wave within minutes and the individual works with the Creator, God, or the Universe (depending on one's beliefs). Is ThetaHealing the Right Choice for You?

Usually, a session lasts between half an hour and an hour and a half and how many sessions you need is conditioned by the problem you want to address. As explained on [Theta Alchemy](https://www.thetaalchemy.com/what-is-theta-healing/), the practitioner is concentrated on defining the crucial beliefs which are encouraging your emotional or physical issue with the help of a tool known as digging. It gives the practitioner the ability to unravel the numerous layers of belief and reach the bottom one. Hence, it is believed that when this bottom belief is shifted, the remaining beliefs which come after it will consequently change and the individual will be free of limits and will not have to pass through early traumas. Another important aspect of a ThetaHealing session is when the practitioner checks out to discover if you hold specific beliefs through muscle testing; remember that everything which is being done during a session requires your consent, i.e. a simple yes signalizes that you are ready for the new reality. The sessions are done in a safe and supportive area where the practitioner and the individuals involved can freely explore all aspects of their life that they would like to change or improve.
