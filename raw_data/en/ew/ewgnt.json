But if the perception spreads that vaccination is a greater risk that the disease it prevents, and in consequence vaccination is regarded as optional, the risk is far greater. What will be impaired is herd immunity. Herd immunity means that virtually all the individuals in the group have been immunized, and therefore the disease-causing organisms have no place to hide. It is because of herd immunity that we no longer need to worry about smallpox or polio. But when some individuals are not immunized as in parts of Africa, where the polio vaccine was viewed as an anti-Islamic plot, the disease can spring back with deadly consequences. Herd immunity is much more potent protection against disease than the individual immunization, which depends on the degree to which the individual mounts an immune response to the vaccine. But herd immunity depends on all the individuals in the group being vaccinated. Society has an obligation to preserve herd immunity, and to insist that immunization be universal. Michael Jorrin Ridgefield, Conn., June 25, 2007 To the Editor: Thank you for continuing this important discussion on a possible vaccination-autism connection. I have been observing this situation since my children were born in the 1980s. One thing I have noticed is the frequency of this comment, included in one of your June 25 letters, that when alerted to changes in a child's health after vaccination, the doctor dismisses it. So much potential data lost! We need a national registry where these claims can be registered and explored. Something is causing this amazing surge in autism cases.
