Or are you experiencing flu-like symptoms and just want to get back to feeling better? An IV nutrition treatment with us might just be what you need for overall wellness. Here's what you should know about the benefits of IV nutrition for integrative medicine. What is IV Nutrition? Also known as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), IV nutrition is a form of therapy that involves delivering essential nutrients to a patient intravenously. It may sometimes also be referred to as intravenous micronutrient therapy (IVMT) or IV vitamin therapy. What are the Common Uses of IV Nutrition? Traditionally, IV nutrition has been used when a patient's gastrointestinal tract cannot provide the body with nutrients through digestion and oral diets. This can occur for several reasons, including acute pancreatitis, short bowel syndrome, and nausea and constant vomiting during pregnancy. Today, IV nutrition therapies are frequently used to treat: - dehydration - hangovers - jet lag - food poisoning - fibromyalgia - migraines - allergies For many patients, IV nutrition therapies form a part of their regular wellness routine and can be used to manage stress, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue syndrome. Regular use of IV nutrition can improve overall levels of wellness and quality of life. What Are the Benefits of IV Nutrition? There are multiple benefits to undergoing IV nutrition. First off, IV nutrition consists of nutrients that are in their elemental form, allowing for immediate nourishment of the cells and energy to the body when directly administered into the bloodstream. Nutrients present in the IV fluid will depend on why you need IV nutrition. Nutrients present in IV nutrition can include macro and micronutrients, such as: - proteins\u2014present as amino acids - carbohydrates\u2014typically in the form of dextrose - fats - electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals such as manganese, zinc, vitamins K, B and C When administered by a trained healthcare individual known as an IV therapist, IV nutrition is relatively painless and minimally invasive. Most people who regularly use IV nutrition report an immediate improvement in their symptoms. What to Expect During an IV Nutrition Appointment If you've never had IV nutrition therapy before, you might wonder what to expect during your first appointment. A certified IV therapist or trained physician at One Source Integrative Medicine will begin by asking you a series of questions to determine your current health, including your lifestyle and dietary choices, as well as any medications you may currently be taking. During the actual process, your doctor will insert an intravenous catheter into your vein\u2014this will be used to deliver the IV nutrition fluid directly into your bloodstream. The mix of electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals will differ from one patient to the next and is a highly personalized form of therapy. A treatment plan may involve weekly IV sessions initially, especially in the case of chronic illnesses and pain, before being spaced to two to three weeks apart. Your appointment can last anywhere from 30 minutes to up to 90 minutes, depending on your symptoms. Effective IV nutritional therapies require an accurate evaluation and prompt care using safe, effective IV techniques.
