Researchers want to learn more about these reactions to provide guidance on who can safely receive the vaccines, including a second dose in people who had a reaction to the first. Objective: To study the safety of giving a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose to people who had a systemic allergic reaction to their first dose. Eligibility: People aged 16-69 who had a systemic allergic reaction to their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Design: Individuals who have underlying health issues may need to come to the NIH for screening tests to make sure they are safe to receive the vaccine. People who are eligible to participate in the study will be admitted to the NIH hospital and stay for at least 4 days. They will give urine samples. They will have a nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 test. They will have an intravenous line placed in each arm. They will get the study vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) and one dose of placebo on different days. They will have breathing tests. They may have clinical photography if they develop a rash. Participants will have 4 follow-up visits - 2 by phone and 2 in-person visits at the NIH campus . They will have allergy skin testing at one visit. Drops of different allergens or controls will be placed on their back or arm. The skin under each drop will be scratched with a tool. If the results are negative, a small amount of allergen will be injected just below the surface of their skin. Participants who have no or only a mild allergic reaction to the second dose of the vaccine may be eligible to receive a Booster dose at the NIH. Participation will last for approximately 5 months. |Condition or disease||Intervention/treatment||Phase| |Systemic Assess the Safety of Administering a Second Dose of a COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in Individuals Who Experienced a Systemic Allergic Reaction to an Initial Dose| |Actual Study Start Date :||September 8, 2021| |Actual Primary Date :||June Active Vaccine | Participant receives the active mRNA COVID-19 vaccine | Biological: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (Comirnaty) | mRNA vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.
