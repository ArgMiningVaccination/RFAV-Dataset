Seeing blood clots during your period is not a cause for concern and is experienced by most women around the world. Menstrual blood clots develop when the uterus sheds an increased amount of blood which coagulates in your vagina before coming out of the body. While blood clots during menstruation are not harmful, if you experience heavy bleeding for more than seven days, consult a doctor immediately. In this article, we take a look at some of the natural remedies available for the treatment of blood clots during your periods. In This Article What Is A Menstrual Blood Clot? Menstrual blood clots are globs of coagulated blood that have a gel-like appearance. These globs can also be tissues and by-products of blood that are expelled from the uterus during the menstrual cycle. Small and less frequent blood clots are a common occurrence, and you don't need to worry about them. However, if you are regularly passing large clots during your period, it could be an indication of an underlying medical condition. Blood clots are often classified as normal or abnormal, depending on their appearance. Let's look at the types in detail Types Of Blood Clots Normal blood clots are usually: - Smaller (not larger than a quarter) - Occasional (usually occur at the beginning of your menstrual cycle) - Bright or dark in color On the other hand, abnormal blood clots are: - Larger than a quarter - Occur frequently So, what causes these clots in the first place? Let's find out. What Causes Blood Clots During Periods? The menstrual cycle of a fertile woman repeats every 28 to 35 days, lasting for about 4 to 8 days. It causes the shedding of the uterine lining (also called the endometrium). The endometrium, which thickens and grows in response to the hormone estrogen, supports a fertile egg upon conception. However, if a woman does not conceive during this period, this lining sheds off. This whole process is called menstruation. This shedding causes blood clots during menstruation. When the lining is shed, it may get mixed with - Blood - Blood by-products - Mucus - Tissue The endometrium usually pools in the bottom of the uterus and waits for the cervix to contract to be expelled. To help with the breakdown of this lining, your body produces anticoagulants. When the blood flow surpasses the amount of anticoagulants produced, it results in blood clots. Medical conditions responsible for heavy blood flow during your periods are: - Uterine obstructions that enlarge the uterus - Fibroids, which are noncancerous muscular tumors that grow in the uterine wall - Polyps, which are tissue growths that develop in the inner lining of your uterus - Endometriosis, a condition in which the uterine lining grows outside the uterus and into your reproductive tract - Adenomyosis, which occurs when the uterine lining grows into the uterine wall - Cancerous tumors - Hormonal imbalances - Postpartum hemorrhage - Uterine cancer and cervical cancer - Pelvic inflammatory disease According to a [survey](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/uterine-cancer/statistics#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20an%20estimated%2066%2C200,with%20uterine%20cancer%20in%202020.) in 2023 about 66200 people in the United States are likely to be diagnosed with uterine cancer. It is the 4th most common cancer that affects women in the the US. In 2020, about 417367 cases were registered worldwide. It is more prevalent among Black women than White women in the US. The number people diagnosed with uterine cancer has been rising by 2% every year among women aged 49 and below and by 1% per year in elderly women. Hence, it is advisable to consult a doctor when you observe symptoms like blood clots in your period to avoid risks. Menstrual clotting can also be accompanied by the following side effects. Side Effects Of Menstrual Clotting - Anemia due to abnormally heavy blood flow - Severe pain or period cramps We strongly recommended you visit a doctor if your menstrual blood clots are more frequent.
