Not only was I looking forward to viewing that country's untouched natural beauty (which we drove around and polluted with fossil fuels), but I was very curious to meet these remark- able islanders. Iceland consistently ranks high on worldwide health scales. According to the 2019 Bloomberg Global Health Index, Iceland is the world's third-healthiest country. Canada ranks sixteenth. Iceland also rated fourth in the 2018 World Happiness report. I began my study of these healthy, happy locals as I emerged jet lagged from Icelandic Air flight one (maybe it was two). My first opportunity for evaluation was the car rental attendant who much to my surprise didn't have blond hair or blue eyes. I gained his trust by smooth small talk. \"How will traffic be?\" \"Shouldn't be bad as many people are at the island festival.\" \"So Icelandic people like festivals?\" \"I wouldn't know as I am Polish.\" (Poles make up 3% of the population.) Clearly, I would have to dig deeper. After finding our bed-and-breakfast, which wasn't easy as it is common to get directions in Iceland such as, \"Our road isn't on GPS so find the second gate past the two sheep,\" I decided to do some research. Perhaps, I thought, the secret to Icelanders' health and happiness is the health care system. However, similar to our own system, in Iceland health care is a publicly funded and divided into health regions. They also have had problems with retention of physicians and other health professionals due to lower salaries than other Scandinavian countries\u2014so I guess health care isn't the reason for their happiness after all. I thought, maybe the answer lies in Iceland's natural wonders. Mountains, rivers, and water- falls (which in Icelandic is a foss ) are plentiful. I saw Dentalfoss, Permafoss, Candyfoss, Jackfoss, and more. But BC is beautiful as well\u2014it even says so on our licence plates. How about bad habits? Smoking rates in our two countries are similar, and when it comes to alcohol, Icelandic people are descended from Vikings so horns of ale abound. I decided the answer must lie in the local diet so I scanned in detail the first restaurant menu I was given\u2014 mostly lamb, fish, and cheese. Farther down the list I noticed I could order shark, whale, horse, and puffin. Other cultures consume the first three, but cute little puffins? (By the way, it takes a few to make a meal.) Fruit and vegetables are rare, likely due to the fact they are hard to grow on cold volcanic rock. Icelandic people also love hotdogs, which don't appear on any top 10 healthy lists. I had one, which was delicious mostly due to the crumbled Icelandic delicacy lining the bun\u2014I think they are locally know as Doritos. So the mystery isn't revealed in the diet. Perhaps the people are in better physical condition. I did notice a lot of pools and gyms. They also love soccer (football) and 10% of the population accompanied their team to last year's World Cup. I haven't heard of any famous Ice-landic cyclists as their 90 km per hour paved roads don't have shoulders, so they are probably all dead. But Canadians are a pret - ty fit bunch as we all play hockey. (Well, I don't, but the rest of you do.) So maybe the answer was to be found in a couple of other interesting Icelandic facts. Ice- land has the lowest population density of any European country at three people per square kilometre. Also, Icelandic couples often don't get married\u2014they just don't see the need for it. Perhaps the secret to health lies in the abun- dance of sheep, I next wondered. You can hike up a remote mountain, and around some corner sitting in a crevasse will be three sheep staring back at you. Apparently the farmers put them out in the late spring and round them up in the fall. They are all tagged to show which farm they are from, so the mischievous part of me wanted to pack a few of them in my car, drive them to the other end of the country, and re- lease them there. The chance of being pulled over by police was slim; I saw only two officers (they don't carry guns) during the whole trip and, you guessed it, it was at a bakery (donut shop). However, Canada also has a lot of sheep and even more cows, so I don't think the answer lies in cloven hoofs. So after 2 weeks of extensive scientific study I concluded the secret to health and happiness is this: don't get married, don't have neighbors, do eat puffin. Either that or drink like a Viking. n \u2014DRRThe secret to i celandic health and happiness icelandic people love hotdogs, which don't appear on any top 10 healthy lists. speech technology specialists for 19 years speakeasysolutions.com 1-888-964-9109 CONT ACT US TODA Y!

This happens in our household every September, and gradually the number of photo subjects decreases with each matriculation. Our youngest ones are in grade 12, and they went for their actual graduation photos this week- end. That just seems weird and too soon, but it is a fact of life. We mark births, marriages, graduations, birthdays, anniversaries, and reunions with pho- tos and proud social media posts and emails. They seem like happy things to document and we take photos and send details simply as a matter of course. But there are other natural milestones that we are less likely to mark and share: an elderly person's last day in their own home, the begin- ning of the last day in the office, the last surgery performed, the slow or not-so-slow change from brown to grey, the first set of cheaters, the last moments of life. I mean, people do document these things, but sharing them proudly seems a bit more edgy, or taboo, or not fun, or just in bad taste. I've been thinking that we should honor these transitions too. As humans and biological Transitions creatures, we are always transitioning. In life, as we get older, people tend to just become more invisible, especially women. We exist, we keep on going, but for most people, it's as though there is a mute on being interesting enough to warrant updates, or we think that maybe because we aren't as youthful we wouldn't want to appear unattractive, having let ourselves go. We kind of become hangers onto our kids' or associates' transi- tions and ignore our own. Think about those lists of people we lost that they trot out at the Oscars ev-ery year. Most of those people lived for much longer after their careers than during them, but we don't think about that part of their life as being newsworthy or important. In a medical career, we go from new recruit to junior staff to senior staff to retired (hope-fully) emeritus. The time during which we are working passes by, and except for maybe some posed shots at a retirement party, or lifetime achievement awards, we usually don't mark the declining transitions in work except en passant. I don't know. I guess as I see myself inching closer to retirement, I want to start looking at these natural, gentle declining transitions as being just as positive as starting a new job, or getting a promotion, or having a baby. Any- one can be young; not everyone gets to be old. I want to have pictures of my wrinkles and grey hair in all their non- glory. I want to know that as I get a thicker middle and become more hobbly- kneed that I'll accept that as a kind of marker of making it to a certain stage and be okay with the consequences and deci- sions I'll have to make. I want a party when I go into an old age home, when it eventually happens. And I want some- one to tell the story of my last days even if that transition is not pretty. Life is short, shorter for some than others. Careers and families transition naturally, like a bell curve of what we think of notability. Let's not avoid embracing the downhill side of that curve. Sunsets are often longer and more beau- tiful than sunrises. n \u2014CVi want to start looking at these natural, gentle declining transitions as being just as positive as starting a new job, or getting a promotion, or having a baby.

Each of us deals with the changes brought on by life differently\u2014some embrace them, while others fight them, seeing them as a herald of physical or cognitive limitations and challenges. No matter your view, we can all agree that aging is unavoidable. The experience of aging is an individual journey. How we achieve healthy aging is of popular interest, particularly as it relates to \"aging in place\" initiatives across the country aimed at supporting seniors who wish to remain in their homes. There are definitely a number of factors out of our control that contribute to aging, such as genetics and the presence of mul- tiple medical conditions. However, diet and exer- cise also play important roles in the experience of aging well, and we do have control over these factors. Maintaining our mental health and limiting our substance use are increasingly being explored as contributors to overall body health and wellness.1 The most graciously aging person I know is my dance teacher who at 83 years of age is still dancing the hula on stage with her aging dance group. Her smile is bright and welcoming. Her arthritic hands are gracious and evoke emotion and meaning with each motion. Her knee range isn't the same as it was 8 years ago before she was hit by a car, and her back doesn't move as well as it did before she fell and broke three vertebrae last winter, but there she is on stage, in her flowing dress, smiling and entertaining us all. It would never occur to her to stop dancing; it has been her life. Compare this with a patient of the same age with diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal disease, and arthritis. His idea of exercise is walking from his chair to the fridge and back, his best friends are his TV remote and reclining chair, and he continues to make poor food choices. These individuals have different expectations and attitudes on aging. So what can we as individual practitioners do to encourage active healthy aging in our patients? I would argue that making time to be- gin the conversation is a first step. A healthy diet really does make a differ- ence to disease develop- ment, but also to weight and muscle mass mainte- nance. Regular exercise, as little as 4400 steps a day, can help increase life ex- pectancy.2 Exercise in gen - eral improves our mental health and contributes to control of or even elimination of a variety of chronic diseases and improves frailty.3 If we, as trusted advi- sors, consistently incorporated diet and exer- cise questions into each patient encounter, and consistently shared the message that these vitals are as important as heart rate and blood pres- sure, we could shift patient expectations and motivate even the most at-risk patients to effect meaningful change one step at a time. As our population demographic ages we should highlight the benefits of healthy aging. Society is beginning to recognize the limiting effects of agism. We need to shift the dialogue on aging from a vision of fading into the sun-set to an active maintenance program akin to properly maintaining a vintage car. It is just too easy to park the body out back, enjoy the easy life, and let the grass grow over the tires. n \u2014Kathleen Ross, MD Doctors of BC President references 1.

These injuries tend to occur in younger individuals with a high risk of subsequent blindness or very poor vision, often accompanied by chronic irritation and pain. Be- tween 2009 and 2018, 198 WorkSafeBC claims were accepted for nail-gun-related injuries. The injured workers were a mean age of 34 years, most were males, and 75% were employed in a construction trade. Pneumatic nail guns, which are relatively easy to use and can significantly increase pro-ductivity, are commonly used in the construc- tion industry. The gun fires a nail, which, at high velocities of up to 160 km per hour, can act as a missile. The nail can injure the eye directly, via ricochet after striking a hard surface or metal, or the gun might backfire or jam. These guns are controlled by a finger trigger and a contact safety tip. Diagnosis On presentation, obtain a careful history and assess visual acuity. In a high percentage of cas- es, the nail may have lodged firmly in the eye. Often, however, the worker removes the nail from the eye at the worksite. Initial slit lamp examination may reveal a sclera or corneal pen- etration, often including prolapsed uveal iris iridodialysis (the iris is disinserted from its root), or lens trauma. An intraocular foreign body may be detected by CT scanning or, in selected cases, by gentle ultrasonography, taking care not to put pres- sure on the eye. Nail-gun eye injuries Treatment Treat the patient with anti-tetanus, if required, and intravenous antibiotics. Arrangements should be made for urgent examination under anesthesia. If the injured worker has not removed the nail, it should be surgi- cally removed from the eye as gently as possible, followed by primary su- turing of sclera or cor- neal wounds. Prolapsed uveal tissue may need to be reposited or excised. If there is marked lens dam- age, primary lensectomy may be necessary. Subse- quently, the patient will need to be assessed by vitreoretinal services. Common posterior segment complications include hemorrhagic choroidal or retinal detachment. Pars plana vitrectomy, with or without gas or silicone oil, may be required. Retinal tears may need to be surrounded by laser. Secondary complications may ensue that require further surgery such as penetrating keratoplasty for corneal scars, cataract extrac- tion, and glaucoma valve implant for secondary glaucoma. Scar tissue may form in the vitreous gel or on the retina (proliferative vitreoreti- nopathy) causing tractional retinal detachment, often requiring multiple surgeries. Visual results may be poor. Prevention Nail-gun injuries can be prevented with strict adherence to established safety measures, in- cluding proper training and education of nail- gun operators. Some studies have found a high percentage of nail-gun injuries among work- ers from overseas with poor English-language skills. Wearing safety glasses and a hard hat are mandatory, and workers must not disable safety features of the gun to increase speed. The risk of nail-gun injury is doubled when a multiple-shot contact trigger is used rather than a single-shot sequential trigger. The lat- ter forces the worker to push the safety tip against the wood and then pull the trigger to shoot one nail, whereas the former allows the worker to squeeze the trigger before pushing in the safety tip, resulting in \"bump\" firing. All nail-gun injuries at work must be reported. Nail guns are useful tools to increase productivity, but they are also poten- tially lethal weapons that need to be treated with respect to prevent life-changing ocular injury. For more information or assistance with an injured worker with a nail-gun eye injury, contact a medical advisor in your nearest Work- SafeBC office. n \u2014Michael O'Donnell, MD, FRCSC WorkSafeBC Additional reading BM, Kelty PJ, Bowie EM.

But the technology hasn't always kept pace with the complexities of health care. Physicians know, for example, that confi- dential information about patients cannot be transmitted via text messages. But that's changing. New privacy-compliant texting platforms are making it possible for Canadian doctors to use their smart phones to conveniently and securely exchange information about patient care. In 2018, physicians working at the Univer - sity Hospital of Northern BC (UHNBC) in Prince George agreed that texting could be a This article is the opinion of the Specialist Services Committee and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.valuable tool for their day-to-day work. While texting does not replace in-person clinical con- versations, it provides many advantages to sup- port communication: it is less intrusive and more responsive than a phone call or voicemail, and it is a simple, quick way to access and share information, especially when a timely response is needed. With this potential in mind, seven UHNBC physicians representing the medical staff ap- proached Northern Health's information tech- nology (IT) department to see if a means of secure texting could be found. Unknown to them at the time, the IT team had already been looking into technology for secure texting. The timing was good: an opportunity for the two groups to collaborate was available through the Specialist Services Committee Facility En- gagement Initiative, a BC-wide program that is increasing physician involvement in health authority decision making. It provides funding for physicians to help identify, plan, and lead improvements in their clinical environment and patient care. Together with Dr Bill Clifford, Northern Health's chief medical information officer and a former family doctor in town, and Ron Klaus- ing, a project manager for Northern Health IT, the physicians got to work to explore secure texting options. They explained their practical, day-to-day needs that texting could support, and the IT team advised on functionality and appropriate use of the technology. The group settled on an application for purchase by North- ern Health that would meet their respective needs as well as BC's privacy requirements. The benefits Once in place, the texting application worked better than anyone imagined it would. The app allows physicians to connect to the patient rec- ords system, search for a patient's name, and link to their chart. As well, physicians can exchange information and photos securely with each oth- er and other clinical providers for consults and handovers, and communicate with nurses and the following mocked-up screenshots show various example exchanges using the texting app. these screenshots do not include any patient information. the ankle image is a stock photo.313 BC MediC al Journal vol. 61 no. 8 | october 2019313spEcialist sErvicEs committEE residents. For example, doctors can alert radi- ology to prepare for an urgent CT and then receive a text back with the results. The app's features offer a welcome change for physicians. When using pagers and voice- mail, it isn't always clear if a communication has been received, but with texts, doctors get an acknowledgment when a message is read and can move on to focus on other things. Other features include alerts when a pa - tient is admitted to hospital. Physicians can also access a directory of all Northern Health departments and on-call schedules, and with one click, connect with other doctors across the region. More functionality will be added over time, including notifications for doctors about critical lab results.Safe and secure Information sent by text remains secure because it is transmitted through the app but never stored in the app, on the company's software, on the phone itself, or in cloud storage. All infor- mation flows through and is stored on Northern Health's servers, with details of conversations retained for legal purposes. Security software is installed on the phone itself and in the app, with a six-digit passcode, facial recognition, and encryption features. Further, Northern Health IT can control the device\u2014including locking or erasing information\u2014if it is lost or stolen. Collaboration: key to success Since it was introduced in spring 2019, secure texting has been embraced by more than half the UHNBC physicians and other clinical staff and residents, with further adoption expected over time. While it is not the main or only method of communicating, it is a convenient, secure way of improving the efficiency of physi- cians' medical practice to support patient care. Throughout this process, collaboration was key to success. Having physician users work with the IT design team to consider needs from their respective viewpoints ultimately led to higher uptake and satisfaction with this excit-ing new tool at UHNBC. n \u2014Brian Hillhouse, MD Family Doctor, Emergency Room Physician, University Hospital of Northern BC 314 BC MediC al Journal vol. 61 no. 8 | october 2019314Your opinion needed: First Link dementia support services The Alzheimer Society of BC and the Univer- sity of British Columbia are working together to evaluate the First Link dementia support services.

Do discharge incentives in emergency departments lead to higher readmission rates? In an effort to address emergency department overcrowding, pay-for-performance incentive programs have been implemented in various regions around the world, including hospitals in Metro Vancouver. But a new study from the UBC Sauder School of Business shows that while such programs can reduce barriers to ac- cess for admitted patients, they can also lead to patient discharges associated with return visits and readmissions. The study looked at over 800 000 patient visits to the four major emergency departments in Metro Vancouver over a 3-year period from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2016. The study focused on patients with higher acuity levels (triage level 1, 2, or 3). During the first year of the study period, two pay-for-performance incentive programs were in effect, funded by the BC provincial government: emergency de- partments received a $100 compensation for each discharged patient with a length of stay of less than 4 hours. Emergency departments also received a $600 compensation for admitted patients who spent less than 10 hours in the emergency department. The government terminated both pay-for- performance programs on 31 March 2014; however, the regional health authority govern- ing all four emergency departments studied decided to internally fund the exact same $600 admission incentive scheme, which continued without interruption. Only the $100 discharge incentive completely disappeared after the gov- ernment pay-for-performance program was terminated. \"In the past, the extent to which these types of programs affected the length of stay of individual patients was not well understood because previous studies have only examined aggregate performance metrics as they relate to length of stay,\" says Yichuan (Daniel) Ding, study co-author and assistant professor in the Operations and Logistics Division at the UBC Sauder School of Business. \"Our study took a much more granular approach, where we fo- cused specifically on patient discharges that took place within 20 minutes of the deadline for the incentive, because we wanted to know if these patients were discharged to catch the deadline.\" The study found that for those patients who were discharged home, there was a significant discontinuity around the 4-hour mark, meaning that there was a significant number of patients who were discharged right before the 4-hour mark. But after the 4-hour mark, there was a decreasing likelihood that a patient would be discharged. This phenomenon was observed in only two of the four emergency depart- ments; the other two did not exhibit this same discontinuity. \"Our study confirmed that this type of financial incentive altered system performance. And in the positive sense, that means that the program is effective because it impacts length of stay for both discharged and admitted pa- tients,\" says Eric Park, study co-author and assistant professor in the Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Hong Kong. \"But when we looked more granularly at the patients who were discharged within 20 minutes before the deadline, we found that one of the four emergency departments had a greater revisit and readmission rate within 7 days\u2014mean - ing that within 7 days, those patients are more likely to come back and be admitted to hospital. It is possible that this is a signal of premature discharge.\" \"However, we cannot assert that discharge is premature using this metric alone, especially given that it was only observed in one of the four emergency departments, but it is a poten- tially worrisome finding,\" adds Yuren Wang, study co-author with the National University of Defense Technology in Changsha, China. The study also found that for the case of admitted patients at the 10-hour mark, the discontinuity was even more significant, and it applied to all four emergency departments, not just the two. \"Our recommendations based on this re - search are that setting an incentive for admitted patients improves length of stay, but the 4-hour benchmark for discharged patients should be implemented with care,\" says Dr Garth Hunte, study co-author and emergency physician at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver. \"There is no sense for an incentive to discharge patients that may require admission to hospital.\" This is consistent with what the hospitals are actually now doing, due to the regional health authorities' ongoing funding of the admission incentive.

In a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers at the University of British Columbia, in partnership with the Provincial Health Services Authority's Therapeutic Evaluation Unit, found that current users of fluoroquinolone antibiotics, such as Ciprofloxacin or Cipro, face a 2.4 times greater risk of developing aortic and mitral regurgita- tion, where the blood backflows into the heart, compared with patients who take amoxicillin, a different type of antibiotic. The greatest risk is within 30 days of use. Recent studies have also linked the same class of antibiotics to other heart problems. Some physicians favor fluoroquinolones over other antibiotics for their broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and high oral absorption, which is as effective as intravenous treatment. \"You can send patients home with a once- a-day pill,\" said Mahyar Etminan, lead author and associate professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences in the Faculty of Medicine at UBC. \"This class of antibiotics is very conve-nient, but for the majority of cases, especially community-related infections, they're not re- ally needed. The inappropriate prescribing may cause both antibiotic resistance as well as serious heart problems.\" The researchers hope their study helps in- form the public and physicians that if patients present with cardiac issues, where no other cause has been discovered, fluoroquinolone an- tibiotics could potentially be a cause. \"One of the key objectives of the Thera- peutic Evaluation Unit is to evaluate different drugs and health technologies to determine whether they enhance the quality of care de- livered by our programs or improve patient outcomes,\" said Dr Bruce Carleton, director of the unit and research investigator at BC Chil- dren's Hospital. \"This study highlights the need to be thoughtful when prescribing antibiotics, which can sometimes cause harm. As a result of this work, we will continue working with the BC Antimicrobial Stewardship Committee to ensure the appropriate prescribing of this class of antibiotics to patients across British Co- lumbia, and reduce inappropriate prescribing.\" For the study, scientists analyzed data from the US Food and Drug Administration's adverse reporting system. They also analyzed a mas- sive private insurance health claims database in the US that captures demographics, drug identification, dose prescribed, and treatment duration. Researchers identified 12 505 cases of valvular regurgitation with 125 020 case-control subjects in a random sample of more than 9 million patients. They defined current fluoro- quinolone exposure as an active prescription or 30 days prior to the adverse event, recent expo- sure as within 31 to 60 days, and past exposure as within 61 to 365 days prior to an incident. Scientists compared fluoroquinolone use with amoxicillin and azithromycin. The results showed that the risk of aortic and mitral regurgitation, blood backflow into the heart, is highest with current use, followed by recent use. They saw no increased risk aortic and mitral regurgitation with past use. Etminan hopes that if other studies confirm these findings, regulatory agencies would add the risk of aortic and mitral regurgitation to their alerts as potential side effects and that the results would prompt physicians to use other classes of antibiotics as the first line of defence for uncomplicated infections. This study was funded and conducted by the Department of Ophthalmology and the Therapeutic Evaluation Unit at the Provincial Health Services Authority. Lack of racial diversity in cancer drug trials New research published in JAMA Oncology has found a lack of racial and ethnic diversity in clinical trials for cancer drugs. The study\u2014conducted by researchers from UBC, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, and Baylor University in Tex- as\u2014raises concerns about the effectiveness of cancer drugs in some patients, especially since genetic differences may affect how well a patient responds to a drug. The researchers found that fewer than 8% of cancer drug trials reported participation from the four major races in the United States\u2014 white, Asian, black, and Hispanic\u2014between 2008 and 2018. Black and Hispanic patients were particularly underrepresented at 22% and 44%, respectively, considering their populations' incidence of cancer. The findings show that the science might not be applicable to the popula- tion that's going to receive the medications. The researchers found that both reporting about race in trials and enrolment rates had changed minimally over the decade. For this study, Dr Jonathan Loree (assistant professor, UBC Department of Medicine, Di- vision of Medical Oncology) and colleagues reviewed all reported trials supporting US Food and Drug Administration oncology drug ap- provals granted between July 2008 and June 2018. They scrutinized 230 trials with a total of 112 293 participants. They calculated the US population-based cancer estimates by race using National Cancer Institute and US census data. Although the researchers used US data, Dr Loree says the findings are relevant in Canada, as well. Pharmaceutical companies typically ap- ply for drug approvals through the FDA first, because it serves the largest market, and then submit to the European Medicines Agency and Health Canada. The trials considered in the approvals are usually the same. Dr Loree also notes that they weren't able to analyze the participation of Indigenous people in trials because there were only 13 patients reported out of a total of 112 000 participants. The researchers are now looking at whether clinical trials represent the same gender ratio as the general population to ensure the drugs are effective in all people.

This article has been peer reviewed.ABSTRACT Background: The total cost of mental health dis- orders to Canada's economy is estimated to be more than $50 billion annually. Although evidence supports the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression and anxiety disorders, access to therapy is limited. This is especially the case in the Vancouver Island community of Victoria, where depression and anxiety are prevalent but treat - ment is difficult to obtain. In 2015 the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) Skills Group program was initiated to provide early, destigmatizing, equi- table, and timely intervention on a large scale and to enhance collaborative care between psychiatrists and family physicians. Funding was provided by the Shared Care Committee with contributions from the Victoria Division of Family Practice and Island Health. Family physicians were trained by psychiatrists to facilitate the CBT-based training to be delivered in 90-minute group medical visits over 8 consecutive weeks. A referral centre was established and participants were asked to sign up online to join a skills group of 15 members. Methods: Four psychometric scales were used to measure participant depression symptoms, anxi-ety symptoms, and functional disability: the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Participants used these scales to provide preintervention and postintervention self-reports. As well, participants rated the impact of the program and provided qualitative feedback. All participant responses were converted into non-nominal data and analyzed by an external agency (Reichert and Self-reported data suggest participants experienced a reduction in symptoms of depression and anxiety. Average patient satisfaction was 4.66 on a 5-point scale. Self-Management Training in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Skills J. Cheek, MD, FRCPC, E. Burrell, MD, FRCPC, C.

A wait-time analysis was also conducted partway through the project period. Results: From September 2015 to April 2018, a total of 2352 participants registered in 149 CBT skills groups. The majority of participants were female (1820) and their average age was 46 years. More than half of participants attended most sessions. Self-reports were collected from 874 of 1403 par - ticipants attending six or more of the eight sessions for a response rate of 62%. Mean symptom scores on psychometric scales for anxiety, depression, and functional disability indicated improvement, with many participants demonstrating a shift from moderate to mild levels of symptom severity (n = 802). The average participant satisfaction rating for the program on a 5-point Likert scale was 4.66. The wait-time analysis showed that approximately three-quarters of participants referred had entered a group within 3 months of referral (628 of 832), and approximately one-quarter entered a group within 1 month of referral (204 of 832). Conclusions: The self-report data analyzed dur - ing the project suggest participants in the CBT Skills Group program experienced a reduction in symptoms of depression and anxiety. How - ever, these results must be interpreted cautiously because data were not collected for research purposes but for program quality improvement. A particular challenge encountered during the project was the lack of resources to individually screen and prepare each patient. Consequently, patients who were not a good fit for group CBT delivery (e.g., patients with personality disorder or active trauma symptoms) were occasionally referred. While it may seem costly to use family physicians to facilitate CBT skills groups, the cost of usual care wherein family physicians provide four 20-minute individual appointments ($209.80) was comparable to the per-person cost of the intervention ($197.52), where patients receive 12 hours of physician-led group time, making the skills groups a cost-effective and equitable way to deliver early intervention services. Current limita- tions in mental health care also make physicians the only viable service providers. Furthermore, having family physicians deliver mental health services may reduce stigma by showing that mental health affects general health and is valued as a vital part of primary care. Background Mental health conditions are the leading cause of chronic illness in Canada. In 2016 one in five people were affected by a mental illness, nearly twice the number affected by heart disease and type 2 diabetes.1 The costs of untreated mental health disorders are immense: in- dividuals suffer poor qual- ity of life, disability, lost productivity,1 physical health problems, increased mortality,2 impaired social functioning, and negative impacts on the develop- ment and mental health of offspring.3 The total economic burden of mental health problems in Canada is estimated to be over $50 billion annually.1 Surveys report a high rate of mental health conditions on Vancouver Island.4 Equally alarming is the steady rise in depression and anxiety each year in this region, as seen by com - paring the 2013 prevalence rate of 24.3% with the considerably lower 1992 rate of 3.7%.4 A recent Canadian study showed that the rise in mental health conditions is growing most rap- idly in children and youth, suggesting this trend will continue.2 Unfortunately, mental health services have not kept up with the demand, and access to treatment is a major obstacle to managing this crisis. Treatment A biopsychosocial model is used most com- monly to treat depression and anxiety, with treatment guidelines addressing both the biological component (e.g., antidepressant therapy) and psychosocial component (e.g., psychotherapy and self-management skills such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based interventions, and inter- personal interventions).3 Meta-analyses show that CBT is equivalent to antidepressants in treating depression5 and most anxiety disorders.6 Consequently, psycho- social treatments are often recommended as monotherapy for mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression, or in combination with medication for more severe symptoms.3,7 However, access to psychosocial treatments is extremely limited in the Vancouver Island community of Victoria. While psychiatrists and public mental health teams provide publicly funded psychosocial treatments, the criteria for entry is a very high level of symptom severity, meaning those with mild- to-moderate symptoms are frequently deemed \"not sick enough.\" Treat- ment from a nonphysician mental health professional such as a clinical counselor or psychologist typically falls under the private sys- tem for people with mild- to-moderate symptoms, making cost a major barrier to treatment. This is especially the case for those most in need, as mental health conditions are associated with lower earning potential and socioeconomic sta- tus, both as risk factors and as a consequence of such illnesses. 8 With 1.6 million Canadians reporting unmet mental health care needs each year, a recent Canadian Mental Health Associa- tion survey reported that 85% of Canadians felt that mental health services are among the most underfunded services in the health care system. 9 Since treatment by a physician is covered by the BC Medical Services Plan (MSP), fam- ily physicians remain the only viable service providers for many of those with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression. Indeed, up to 80% of Canadians rely on the primary care system for mental health care. 9 However, fam- ily physicians experience many limitations in providing adequate psychosocial treatments for their patients. First, the major family physician shortage in most of BC, including Vancouver Island, 10 leaves family physicians with limited time and resources to adequately address men- tal health needs. Second, family physicians are restricted to eight 20-minute individual coun- seling sessions and one mental health planning session per patient (equivalent to 3.2 hours to- tal), as outlined in the General Practice section of the Medical Services Commission payment schedule.11 Finally, many family physicians have too little experience to provide evidence-based Cheek J, Burrell E, Tomori C Mental health services have not kept up with the demand, and access to treatment is a major obstacle to managing this crisis.Cheek J, Burrell E, Tomori C318 BC MediC al Journal vol. 61 no. 8 | october 2019318 CliniC al psychosocial care to their patients, as these skills are not consistently included in family practice training. Further complicating service delivery is the added burden of stigma concerning mental health conditions. Many people with mental health conditions describe this stigma as more debil- itating than the illnesses themselves.12 Stigma leads to discrimination and dis- empowerment and can ultimately prevent those who most need servic- es from seeking them.13 Mental health interven- tions need to address stig- ma both when promoting an intervention to patients and physicians and as a treatment target. While accessing evidence-based treatment is difficult for people struggling with mild-to- moderate depression and anxiety, the Mental Health Commission of Canada has stated that \"Investments in evidence-based programs that focus on early and timely intervention can go a long way to prevent or mitigate the impact of illnesses over the life course.\"1 The challenge is translating knowledge about treating depression and anxiety into action\u2014specifically, deliver- ing early interventions for mild-to-moderate depression and anxiety conditions.1,14 Based on suggestions from the Organisation for Eco- nomic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank, and the World Health Organiza - tion, the Mental Health Strategy for Canada states we must focus on delivering \"upstream efforts, timely intervention, improved access to evidence-based treatment, and addressing inequities and the social determinants in trans- forming mental health care.\"1 CBT Skills Group program The Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) Skills Group program was developed to de- liver evidence-based primary care treatments for mild-to-moderate depression and anxiety. Our primary aim was to implement a cost- effective and highly accessible service able to provide early, destigmatizing, equitable, and timely intervention on a large scale. Our sec- ondary aims were to enhance collaboration and mentorship between psychiatrists and family physicians, and to expand family physicians' knowledge and confidence in promoting the use of evidence-based psychosocial skills. A team of family phy- sicians and psychiatrists secured funding from the Shared Cared Commit - tee and the Victoria Di- vision of Family Practice to develop curriculum and assist with start-up costs for the program. The team developed 90-minute sessions to be delivered through group medical visits over 8 consecutive weeks: Session 1. Introduction to CBT; distress tolerance skills (dialectical behavioral therapy\u2014DBT). Session 2. Introduction to mindfulness (mindfulness-based cognitive therapy\u2014 MBCT; mindful self-compassion\u2014MSC). Session 3. Mindfulness approach to difficult thoughts (MBCT). Session 4. Cognitive therapy (CBT). Session 5. Introduction to emotions and opposite action (DBT/CBT). Session 6. Troubleshooting and motiva - tion enhancement (CBT/motivational interviewing). Session 7. Exploring values and value-based specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-based (SMART) goals (acceptance and commitment therapy\u2014ACT). Session 8. Relapse prevention and moving forward. The integration of skills seen in the program mirrors recent protocols designed by leaders in CBT approaches such as Barlow and col- leagues,15 and emphasizes psychoeducation and skills acquisition for a primary care population. A collaborative process was used to train four family physicians to facilitate CBT skills groups. A family physician first observed a psy- chiatrist facilitating a full set of eight sessions, then took on a minor co-facilitator role for another set of sessions, and finally acted as a major co-facilitator for a third set of sessions. After the training period, family physicians facilitated groups on their own, with ongoing consultation with psychiatrists as needed. Phy- sician facilitators were compensated through MSP with a GMV (group medical visit) code fee. Sessional support was available to the fam- ily physician and the mentoring psychiatrist for 30 to 60 minutes of debriefing time per session during the training. A centralized referral centre was established, embedded within the Victoria Division of Fam- ily Practice, and a medical office assistant was hired to manage referrals, communicate with referring physicians, book rooms for groups, and schedule groups and facilitators. Methods Prospective participants were screened by re - ferring family physicians, who received infor-mation about the CBT Skills Group program through a launch event and written media (e-newsletter, website, brochure). Exclusion criteria for participants included severe depression, active risk of harm to self or others, cognitive impairment, significant level of substance use, personality disorder that may interfere with group process, and active psycho- sis, mania, or trauma/dissociative symptoms. Psychometric scales Group facilitators provided participants with self-report measures to complete before and after treatment: the Patient Health Question- naire-8 (PHQ-8), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). The PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 are self-report symptom checklists that score each DSM de- pression criterion from 0 to 3, with the PHQ- 8 omitting the final question in the PHQ-9 about suicidal ideation.16 The original validation studies for the PHQ consisted of 6000 patients and showed identical thresholds for the scor-ing of depression severity in both the PHQ-8 and PHQ-9. 16 The GAD-7 is a self-report symptom checklist that scores seven generalized anxiety symptoms from 0 to 3, and has been found to have high internal reliability and validity.17 The WSAS is a self-report scale measuring Self-management training in cognitive-behavioral therapy skills Our primary aim was to implement a cost- effective and highly accessible service able to provide early, destigmatizing, equitable, and timely intervention on a large scale. 319 BC MediC al Journal vol. 61 no. 8 | october 2019319 CliniC alperceived functional disability on a scale from 0 to 8 (i.e., impairment regarding certain tasks related to work, home, leisure, and social rela-tionships). The WSAS has high internal reli- ability and sensitivity. It is comparable to the PHQ and GAD-7 in measuring treatment effects, and also measures a distinct functioning factor not captured in the PHQ and GAD-7.18 Midway through the evaluation process, feedback led to a change in the measure of functional status from the WSAS to the Shee- han Disability Scale (SDS), as this scale is more commonly used in clinical practice in primary care. The SDS is a three-item self-report. It is a discretized analog measure of functional dis- ability in work, social, and family life that has high internal reliability and construct validity in primary care 19 and is sensitive to treatment effects.20 Participants were also asked to rate their experience in the program and the impact of the program on them by responding to statements such as \"I felt welcome in the group\" and \"I am more confident managing emotions.\" They were asked to do this using a Likert scale ranging from 1 for strongly disagree to 5 for strongly agree. All program completers were also in- vited to submit written qualitative feedback, and volunteers were interviewed in focus groups by independent evaluators. Demographic and wait-time data were collected. Ethics approval was not sought because the project was con- ducted for quality improvement purposes under the auspices of the Shared Care Committee and the Victoria Division of Family Practice, not under the auspices of an academic institution. Data analysis All participant responses were converted into non-nominal data and analyzed by an exter- nal agency (Reichert and Associates). Results from the four psychometric scales (PHQ-8, GAD-7, WSAS, and later SDS) completed by participants before and after the program were compared. Symptom response rates were also obtained, with \"full response\" defined as a 50% or greater reduction in symptoms, and \"partial response\" defined as a 25% to 49% reduction in symptoms. The PHQ-8 scores were further analyzed to determine rates of remission from depression before and after intervention.A wait-time analysis was conducted partway through the project to determine how many days participants waited for treatment. Refer- rals from September 2016 to July 2017 were considered. Results The program received 4150 referrals from 376 referring physicians between September 2015 and April 2018. Of those patients referred, 2352 registered themselves in 149 groups. The ma- jority of participants (77%) were female (n = 1820). The average age of participants was 46 years (range 17 to 89 years). Sixty percent of participants attended six to eight sessions (n =1403), while 29% attended one to five sessions (n = 687), and 8% did not attend any sessions (n =193).

No attempts were made to follow up with non- responders due to a lack of additional resources for this. Results from t test analyses [Figure 1] in- dicate improvements in mean symptom scores of program completers for depression (PHQ-8: -4.2, P < .0001, Cohen's d effect size = 0.86, n = 802), anxiety (GAD-7: -4.6, P < .0001, Cohen's d effect size = 0.99, n = 802), and work and social function (SDS pre-post: -5.3, Cohen's d effect size = 0.77, n WSAS: -4.8, Cohen's d effect size = 0.62, n = 292). A small minority of participants with a change in work status during the course of the program (N = 13) did not fill out the work score of the SDS at T1 or T2, and were thus removed from analysis as their scores were artificially low because they did not complete a third of the questionnaire.

Analyses of the findings revealed that all improvements were statistically significant, and clinical significance was demonstrated by mean score changes that represented a shift from moderate to mild symptomatology. Participant responses to questions about their experience indicate that most would rec- ommend the program to friends and family [Figure 4]. Participant responses to questions about program outcomes indicate most felt more able to manage their mental health symp- toms [Figure 5]. The average participant satis- faction rating was 4.66 out of 5.00. Qualitative feedback suggests that partic- ipants valued learning new skills to manage mental health problems, receiving support and a sense of normalization in the group setting, and learning they were not alone in their suffer- ing. Many participants recommended offering longer or more sessions. A wait-time analysis on referrals from Sep- tember 2016 to July 2017 showed that three-quarters of participants (628 of 832) entered a group within 3 months of referral, with one- quarter (204 of 832) beginning within 1 month of referral [Figure 6]. Conclusions Project findings suggest the Cognitive Behav- ioural Therapy (CBT) Skills Group program provides accessible and timely intervention for those with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression. Self-reports completed before and after participants took part in a skills group showed symptom improvements comparable to those found in the literature for both group and in- dividual CBT.21,22 However, outcome measures reported here must be interpreted cautiously, as the purpose of data collection was quality improvement, not research. There was no ran-domization, and there were no control groups.

A large meta-analysis of 115 studies (N = 20 995) exam- ining dropout rates found group CBT to have higher pretreatment dropout rates of 14.5% compared with 9.7% for individual CBT, and a dropout rate of 24.6% during group CBT that was comparable to the rate for individual CBT.25 High dropout rates occur in both indi- vidual and group interventions for depression and anxiety because of the symptoms of the conditions themselves (i.e., those with anxiety disorders often practise avoidance and those with depression often suffer from poor moti- vation and fatigue). The group setting can be especially anxiety-provoking for individuals with mental health symptoms. As well, group interventions are less flexible than individual interventions and require a more structured pro- tocol to serve all participants. Consequently, the group format may not meet the specific needs of each participant. While the CBT Skills Group program emphasizes self-management rather than psychotherapy proper, the outcomes found are reflective of those reported for group CBT. A particular challenge encountered in this project was the lack of resources to individually screen and prepare each patient. The program relied on referring physicians to screen and orient prospective participants.

To address this, quality improvement efforts tar- geted referring physician selection skills via presentations at grand rounds, dine-and-learns, and annual general meet- ings. As well, direct feed- back was provided by the group facilitator to the re- ferrer on each patient's ap- propriateness for the group setting, and inclusion and exclusion criteria were featured repeatedly in the Victoria Division of Fam- ily Practice e-newsletter. A patient no-show fee is currently being trialed to address patient nonatten-dance and dropouts. Benefits As observed in the qualita- tive feedback, group CBT skills delivery may offer benefits over individual delivery, especially for re- ducing stigma. Contact with group members reminds participants they are not alone and provides opportunities to build social support, which is known to improve outcomes in mental health.26 Participants in the project commonly exchanged contact informa- tion when the group sessions ended, and several groups continued to meet as peers. The skills groups proved to be a cost- effective and equitable way to deliver early in- tervention services with service providers who already provide care for patients with mild-to- moderate mental health concerns. Traditionally, family physicians provide mental health care to their patients through individual visits instead of groups. Based on the payment schedule that was current when the project began, the cost to the health care system for a patient to receive 12 hours of group time led by a family physi- cian was $197.52 (based on 15 patients per session). This cost was comparable to the cost of four 20-minute individual appointments ($209.80) with a family physician.27 Currently, if a family physician were to use all MSP and General Practice Services Committee incen- tive fee codes for in-person care per patient per year, the cost would be twice as much to see a patient individually compared to a patient at-tending a group medical visit. The group visits would also provide 3.75 times more in-person in- teraction.11 Furthermore, having family physicians deliver mental health ser- vices can reduce stigma by showing that mental health affects general health and is valued as a vital part of primary care. The use of family physicians as group fa- cilitators also enhances collaboration and mentor- ship between psychiatrists and family physicians. Having family physicians and psychiatrists work together expands family physicians' knowledge and confidence regarding psy- chosocial skills in primary care, opens pathways for communication, and enables family physicians to coach patients with mental health conditions in their individual practices. Further quality improvements In response to feedback from participants, more advanced program offerings (e.g., booster groups, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, CBT for insomnia) are now available for those who have completed six or more sessions of the original program. Participants are also invited to register in a CBT skills group as many times as they desire. Other quality improvements being tested are group sessions of 2 hours in length and skills programs with more than eight sessions. While this quality improvement project suggests CBT skills groups are a cost-effective and accessible intervention for patients in primary care, more research is needed. This might include formal, randomized, controlled trials with an intention-to-treat analysis and longitudinal follow-up to more robustly as- sess the potential benefits of this short-term intervention. Summary The CBT Skills Group program was imple- mented to provide early, destigmatizing, eq- uitable, and timely mental health intervention on a large scale and to enhance collaboration between psychiatrists and physicians. The self- report data collected from September 2015 to April 2018 suggest participants experienced a reduction in symptoms of depression and anxi- ety. However, these results must be interpreted cautiously because data were not collected for research purposes but for program quality im- provement. Average participant satisfaction rated on a 5-point Likert scale was 4.66, and a wait-time analysis showed that the majority of participants entered a group within 3 months of referral. The cost of physician-led group time compared favorably to the cost of individual family physician appointments, making the skills groups a cost-effective way to deliver early intervention services. n competing interests None declared. references 1.

When the first park opened in Canada in 2011, it was one of 40 worldwide; in 2017, there were over 1000 parks worldwide and 50 million users in North America. 1 The growing popularity of these parks has been matched by growing concern about their safety, spurred by high-profile, serious injuries that have occurred. In 2017, for example, an Ed- monton teenager became paralyzed following a neck injury in a trampoline park, and in 2018, a 46-year-old man died after being injured while using a park in Richmond, BC. Seven months later, at the same Richmond park, a toddler fell through a trampoline and onto a concrete surface underneath. 2 While there is anecdotal evidence of an increase in visits to BC emergency rooms in-volving injuries sustained at trampoline parks, there are no BC-specific surveillance data of the topic. National surveillance databases of hospital-treated injuries, however, show that trampoline park injuries have increased sig- nificantly since 2012.3 These included fractures, dislocations, traumatic brain injuries, and rare spinal injuries. Lower extremity injuries, more stunt-based injuries, and sprains were also more likely compared to injuries sustained on back-yard trampolines. This article is the opinion of the Emergency and Public Safety Committee, a subcommittee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opinion of Doctors of BC. This article has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.These injuries have focused attention on the fact that trampoline parks are unregulated in BC and all other Canadian provinces. While operators may voluntarily join the International Association of Trampoline Parks, which requires members to pledge to meet the organization's safety standards, as of August 2019, only four BC operators are listed as members. 4 In response to this lack of oversight, regional health authori- ties have been advocating for Technical Safety BC, the independent provin - cial body that oversees the safety of rollercoast - ers, zip-lines, waterslides, and other amusement de- vices, to be empowered to also regulate trampoline parks under the Safety Standards Act. Led by the municipality of Richmond, the Union of British Columbia Municipalities passed a resolution expressing a similar position in the fall of 2018. These efforts have had an impact. Techni - cal Safety BC has, over the past months, undertaken a review of the risk of injury at trampoline parks and options for their regula-tion. During the public engagement phase of this review, they heard strong and consistent feedback from the public that regulation was desired,5 and they have recently recommended to the provincial government that the relevant regulations be amended to require oversight of trampoline parks. The BC government has signalled general support for this recommendation.6 However, it is unclear when or how vigorously the needed amendments will be pursued, and there are significant details that remain to be resolved before regulation could begin. Following their consultation, for example, Technical Safety BC highlighted topics such as the safety of flips, the safety of foam pits, and the degree of training required for staff that generated very differ- ent responses among operators.5 In particular, the consultation identified differences between trampoline facilities associated with formal training programs and strictly recreational fa- cilities. The former are regulated by Gymnastics BC, which imposes restrictions based on coach- ing, supervision, first-aid training, and other safety considerations. How to differentiate these types of trampoline facilities has not yet been addressed by Technical Safety BC. For the time being, physicians should be aware of the risks of trampoline parks as well as guidance from the Ca - nadian Paediatrics Asso-ciation, which states that trampolines put children at risk of injury, and chil- dren and their parents should be counseled about this risk and ad- vised not to use trampo- lines. This guidance was formally updated in 2013 and relates primar- ily to home trampoline use, but the associa- tion's current position is that trampoline parks should not be considered to be safer than home trampolines.7 Doctors of BC will continue to monitor injury prevention guidance on this topic as well as changes in trampoline park regulation and will update members as needed. n \u2014David A.

Today's physicians are in a unique position to lead this era of technological integra- tion and innovation. Large amounts of patient data currently being collected will be leveraged to provide clinical insight into personalized health care on a global scale. However, there remain many barriers to wide-scale implementa- tion of artificial intelligence tools, including our historic practices of collecting and documenting patient data, as well as the organization of our health care system. Furthermore, a lack of training has physicians underprepared to reap the full potential of these tools and safeguard against adverse consequences for patient care. Given the exciting opportunities for the use of artificial intel- ligence in medicine, ways to overcome associated challenges must be found. In 2014 the BC Ministry of Health's report, \"Setting Priorities for the BC Health System,\" outlined information management and technology as one of seven strategies to enable efforts toward cre- ating health system change. One subcomponent of this strategy is to Preparing for the future of medicine: Considering the need for data-literate physicians The revolution is here: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are being applied to medicine, though there are considerable challenges ahead. Azzra Mangalji, UBC medical student who enjoys exploring how the current practice of medicine could be enhanced, specifically the technologies entering medical practice in rural and remote areas to allow for improved access to quality health care. She hopes this article will spark discussion about how a practitioner's scope could include data-literacy. Mr Karthikeyan is a third-year UBC medical student interested in the intersection of technology and medicine. During the foundational years of his medical studies, he sought out opportunities to engage in machine learning research. He is excited about the prospective roles that machine learning and artificial intelligence could play in augmenting physicians' practices. He hopes to contribute to efforts to foster a community of data-literate physicians equipped to leverage technology to improve patient outcomes and care. This article has been peer reviewed. build BC's \"informatics capacity to use data to enhance decision making and improve outcomes at all levels of the system.\"1,2 Thus far, the medi- cal community has started to adopt digitization of health information in practice to better collect, communicate, and store medical data.3 In 2016, the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) reported that 75% of general practitioners use electronic medical records (EMRs) to enter or retrieve patient notes, an increase from 26% in 2007.4 More recently, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has surfaced.5 AI is a field that involves computers using data to simulate human cognition, including our ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, and learn from experiences in order to make informed decisions.3 As we move into the intelligence age of medicine, physicians will have to adapt in order to harness the true potential and benefits of AI for patients. Benefits of AI integration in medicine Machine learning (ML), a subfield of AI, has recently received attention for its potential impact on medical practice. ML employs algorithms that can learn patterns from large data sets without being explicitly programmed, and can be equipped with self-correcting tools to improve accuracy with exposure to new data.6 For example, ML is widely used by online retailers to identify additional products a shopper may be in-terested in based on their previous purchases. 6 In medicine, ML maps structured data, in the form of patient input variables (e.g., imaging, genetic markers, laboratory results, a patient's age, gender, symptoms, or medications) to an output (outcome of interest), providing a pattern that can be used to make predictions in future cases. To understand how this is playing out in practice to enhance personalized medicine,7 we look at a few applications of AI in relation to breast cancer. Genetics In 2007, the FDA approved MammaPrint, which uses the weighted average of 70 measured genes in patients with early-stage breast cancer to predict 10-year recurrence risk. It is being used clinically by oncolo-gists to select patients for adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. 8Bcmd 2B326 BC MediC al Journal vol. 61 no. 8 | october 2019326Imaging In 2018, the FDA approved Transpara, which identifies soft tissue and calcification lesions on mammograms to generate a cancer suspicious- ness score. It is being used clinically to improve the decision-making accuracy of radiologists while reading scans.9 Clinical IBM's Watson for Oncology accesses over 300 medical journals and textbooks to \"read\" updated literature, guidelines, over 550 breast cancer cases, as well as patient characteristics, medical history, imaging, and laboratory findings to develop patient-specific breast cancer treatment recommendations. It suggests multiple options for each patient. 10 ML has the potential to significantly assist phy- sicians in proactive decision making. While AI is predicted to first be incorporated into fields that favor structured data such as radiology, dermatology, and pathology, it is relevant to numerous clinical specialties.11 Not only can it augment clinical deci- sion making, it can also help with logistic operations, clinic performance analysis, continuing education, professional development, and population health. 4 Furthermore, the use of natural language process- ing is another subcomponent of AI that deals with transforming unstructured data in the form of clini- cal notes, patient interviews, or medical journals into structured data that can be analyzed by ML, heightening the utility in qualitative aspects of medicine. 12 In order to harness the utility of AI in physicians' day-to-day practices, barriers to integration must first be ad- dressed, and physicians must be taught how to evaluate and use such tools. Challenges of AI integration in medicine Data availability The successful integration of AI into medicine will depend largely on the quantity and quality of accessible electronic data. The data are required to train and test ML models, whether diagnostic, treatment, or admin- istrative. The current structure of the health care system makes obtaining this data challenging. The required data are currently stored in isolated data silos used by pharmacies, laboratories, hospitals, clinics, administra- tive systems, and others. The data need to be collated before they can be used for ML purposes.13 Furthermore, while the use of EMRs may be widespread among primary care physicians, the use of electronic health records (EHRs) in hospitals remains limited, although it is underway. Barriers to data access are compounded by privacy and security issues related to patient data sharing between health authorities.13 In 2016, the CMA reported that due to the structure of the system, harnessing the utility of big data analytic opportunities may be restricted to pri- mary care for now.4 The exchange of data between computer systems and health records is vastly complex, and there is currently no simple, economical way to achieve it.14 Despite these challenges, there are mul- tiple interoperability plans in the works in BC and nationally, offering an optimistic future. 15,16 Data quality When training ML algorithms, patient variables (e.g., age, sex, vitals, and lab results) must be available and represented in a standardized format to allow for aggregation of data sets. Furthermore, these predictor variables should be low cost and commonly collected by physicians.6 However, the variability in recording and formatting data poses a challenge to its use in ML. Patient data are often reported using common clinical terms rather than standardized vocabulary. The nature of medical notes adds another complication as many components lack mathematical characterization. 13 Without a foundation of vast amounts of high- quality data, ML models can perform poorly. There are also important considerations regard- ing ethical challenges, such as the mirroring of hu - man biases in decision making. The application of ML algorithms outside the health care setting has highlighted some of these concerns, including a propensity for racial discrimination. Similar biases may also enter medicine. For instance, if algorithms are trained only on data from certain populations, they may be prone to conclude false generaliza- tions to other groups.6,17,18 Poor representation of populations has been a long-standing issue in the academic community. For example, the Framingham Heart Study poorly predicts the risk of cardiovascular events in non-white populations due to sampling bias.19 Thus, it is paramount to establish measures to minimize these biases from affecting ML models through early critical evaluation of methodological practices, preventing exacerbation of the disparities that currently plague the medical community. Physicians must advocate for their patients by being at the forefront to ensure that core ethical principles are preserved in the development of ML tools. To augment this process, one suggestion is that data warehouses be built before the data are used. This way, the data can be reused by mul- tiple researchers or developers for a variety of purposes and the collecting and cleaning process does not need to be repeated.13 In addition, having physicians equipped with skills to critically evaluate, develop, and deploy such models will help inform appropriate use. The future physician's role As the role of ML in medicine expands, physicians practising clinical medicine will need to evolve.17 With the help of ML, physicians will be able to leverage greater amounts of information from the biological, psychological, and social aspects of patients' lives to further augment personalized patient care. To make this possible, continuous, detailed, and affordable monitoring of patients will contribute to big data sets.3 However, it is of the utmost importance that physicians have a baseline understanding of the tools they are using. They will have to become Bcmd 2B Machine learning employs algorithms that can learn patterns from large data sets without being explicitly programmed, and can be equipped with self-correcting tools to improve accuracy with exposure to new data.327 BC MediC al Journal vol. 61 no. 8 | october 2019327familiar with the legal implications of these new tools, as they protect the privacy and security of their patients. Many argue that medical education must begin to incorporate some of these topics. Despite medical curriculums being time-constrained, it may be necessary to alter teaching strategies and incorporate concepts that are going to revolutionize the field. It may be unrealistic for medi-cal students to become developers or data scientists, but we can begin to train future physicians to become data literate. Students should un- derstand the concepts within ML and AI to critically appraise how data were aggregated and analyzed, and ensure they are appropriately applied.3 Students should also be competent in navigating the terminol- ogy.6 Furthermore, they should understand what it means to practise in a data-rich environment. One study suggests having a foundation of the four Vs of big data: volume of data being collected, variety of data being collected from different sources, ve-locity of data generation, and veracity of data (i.e., its quality).3 In addition, understanding the output of ML algorithms and being able to interpret the prediction will help guide clinical decision making. Lastly, medical students will need to learn how to communicate the information to patients and their families.20 The need for this shift in thinking is being rec- ognized. For example, Boston University School of Medicine has an introductory ML course,21 and Stanford University has an AI-assisted health care course available to their medical stu- dents.22 While curriculums begin to transform, alternate options such as accredited CME courses can be provided to begin educating current medical professionals. Conclusion As we experience the transformation of the medical landscape through the integration of AI, many new possibilities arise. Physicians will play an important role in ensuring these new tools will maximize benefits to all health care stakeholders. However, we anticipate challenges that require system-level preparation. Data literacy will enable physicians to evaluate the role of these tools, optimize their use in patient care, and help to mitigate any pitfalls that may arise. This can potentially open the way for active participation in the research and development of AI-centred medical tools. This is an exciting revolution: we will be able to draw from the insight gathered from the culmination of billions of patients and their outcomes to inform the care of future patients. n competing interests None declared. references 1.

In the context of 919 cases of infectious syphilis re- ported in BC in 2018\u2014representing the highest number of cases in 30 years\u2014and other concern - ing epidemiologic trends (for example, increased cases in females of child- bearing age), BC's provin- cial health officer declared a syphilis outbreak in July 2019. Following consul- tation between members of the BCCDC, Perinatal Services BC, and repro- ductive and pediatric in- fectious diseases experts from BC Women's Hos- pital and Health Centre, the decision was made to institute interim provincial guidelines for en- hanced syphilis screening in pregnancy. These took effect in September 2019. The existing standard recommendations for syphilis screening in pregnancy remain the same: for testing to be done in the first trimester or at the first prenatal visit; additional screening done only in cases where there is clinical sus- picion for ongoing risk during pregnancy. Ad- ditionally, a pregnancy test is recommended for any individual diagnosed with syphilis who is able to become pregnant. The revised guidelines recommend the addition of a syphilis screening test at delivery (or any time after week 35 for those planning home births). The overarching Syphilis outbreak in BC: Changes to syphilis screening in pregnancy This article is the opinion of the BC Centre for Disease Control and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.goal of these interim guidelines is to maximize detection and prevention of maternal and con- genital syphilis while maintaining a responsible approach to screening. More specifically, the objectives of the guidelines are the following: 1. To determine the epidemiology of mater- nal and congenital syphi- lis in BC. Ultimately, the goal is to determine how many cases of maternal and/or congenital syphi- lis are being missed with BC's current screening approach. Given the high rates of syphilis-associat- ed spontaneous abortion,1 the elevated transplacental transmission rate, partic - ularly in early syphilis,2,3 and the long window pe- riod,4 it is plausible that cases are, in fact, being missed in BC. The addi- tion of screening at delivery over a time-limited period will provide valuable information and ensure a comprehensive picture of syphilis epi- demiology in BC is obtained. 2. To ensure timely identification and treatment of maternal and congenital syphilis. Syphilis in pregnancy is associated with adverse health outcomes that can significantly impact the health of both mother and fetus.5 As a ma- jority of infants born with congenital syphilis are asymptomatic at birth, 4 most of those un- treated will develop symptoms within months.6 In the vast majority of cases, maternal treat- ment is curative for fetal infection, and early treatment of the newborn will prevent most symptoms,7,8 making early detection a priority. Implementing these revised, interim syphilis screening guidelines in pregnancy are one part of a larger effort led by the BCCDC and its partners in addressing the syphilis outbreak. Near-future efforts will focus on revising BCCDC's Syphilis Action Plan,9 and empha- sis will be placed on addressing the outbreak in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, who remain the population most impacted by syphilis. n \u2014Troy Grennan, MD BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC), University of British Columbia (UBC) \u2014Ellen Giesbrecht, MD UBC, Perinatal Services BC, BC and Health Centre \u2014Gina Ogilvie, MD BCCDC, UBC, BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre \u2014Ann Pederson, PhD UBC, Perinatal Services BC, BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre \u2014Julie van Schalkwyk, MD UBC, BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre \u2014Mark Gilbert, MD BCCDC, UBC \u2014Jason Wong, MD BCCDC, UBC references 1.

Several times a year, the BCMJ presents a theme issue devoted to a particular discipline or disease entity. We welcome letters, blog posts, articles, and sci- entific papers from physicians in British Columbia and elsewhere. Manuscripts should not have been submitted to any other publication. Articles are subject to copyediting and editorial revisions, but authors remain responsible for statements in the work, including editorial changes; for accuracy of references; and for obtaining permissions. The cor- responding author of scientific articles will be asked to check page proofs for accuracy. The BCMJ endorses the \"Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals\" by the Inter- national Committee of Medical Journal Editors (updated December 2016), and encourages authors to review the complete text of that document at www.icmje.org.

The Board normally meets the last Friday of every month, at which time submissions are distributed for review the following month. We do not acknowl- edge receipt of submissions; the editor will contact authors of articles by email once the submission has been reviewed by the Board (usually within 8 to 10 weeks of submission). The general criteria for acceptance include accuracy, relevance to practising BC physicians, validity, originality, and clarity. The editor contacts authors to inform them whether the paper has been rejected, conditionally accepted (that is, accepted with revisions), or accepted as submitted. Authors of letters are contacted only if the letter is accepted and editorial staff need further information. Scientific papers and other articles typically take 5 to 10 months from the date of receipt to publication, depending on how quickly authors provide revisions BCMJ Guidelines Guidelines for authors and on the backlog of papers scheduled for publica- tion. Manuscripts are returned only on request. The BCMJ is posted for free access on our website. For all submissions Avoid unnecessary formatting, as we strip all for-matting from manuscripts.

Include a descriptive title and units of measure for each table and figure. Obtain permission and acknowledge the source fully if you use data or figures from another published or unpub- lished source. Tables. Please adhere to the following guidelines: Submit tables electronically as Word or Excel files so that they may be formatted for style. Number tables consecutively in the order of their first citation in the text and supply a brief title for each. Place explanatory matter in footnotes, not in the heading. Explain all nonstandard abbreviations in foot - notes. Ensure each table is cited in the text. Figures (illustrations). Please adhere to the follow- ing guidelines: Images must be high resolution; if unsure, send highest resolution possible and we will advise if necessary. Number figures consecutively in the order of their first citation in the text and supply a brief title for each. Place titles and explanations in legends, not in or on the illustrations themselves.
