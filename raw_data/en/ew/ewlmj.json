This treatment needs to be carried out for several weeks before showing results. B is for Bladder problems Bladder problems can be categorized in two ways. One is a weak bladder with a tendency to infections, frequent urination, and possibly incontinence. The other is a bladder with a disorder that withholds urine. A general lack of necessary energy often causes a weak bladder, often associated with fear and difficulties in life. Here, controlling one's immediate situation or specific parts of one's life can improve the bladder problem. An inflamed bladder may also be caused by disease, though any existing weakness will exacerbate it. All bladder infections should be treated professionally. Any advance of infection, through the urethra to the kidneys, may well cause dangerous complications. In particular, [Agate with a pink spot](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B85IVF2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00B85IVF2&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=212129d590d3961254daf1de17b6768e) in the middle is particularly useful for treating bladder infections.

C is for Cellulite Cellulite is the physical evidence of a structural change of the subcutaneous tissue, where fat deposits are formed in the body, resulting in irregularities on the skin's surface. These skin changes have nothing to do with cellulitis's actual medical condition, an inflammation in the skin cell tissue. Cellulite, the cause of which is often incorrectly referred to and ascribed as being age-related, is caused (as are many diseases of the skin and tissues) by waste deposits and accumulation of lymph. Many crystals can enhance the breakdown of such waste deposits and toxins. Exercise, healthy nutrition, massaging the skin, and showering with alternating hot and cold water help alleviate this condition. For regeneration of skin that's affected by cellulite, try [Ocean Jasper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HGF7PP4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07HGF7PP4&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=a56047bbccf75eb06000e10dff255b20).

Therefore, it can be applied as \"preparation\" before using [Brown Tourmaline](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAQCG1L/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01NAQCG1L&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=e840f33d3c17c488cfbc9b80990b001a) (Dravite) gem water.

The cellulite's fat deposits are dissolved in this way, and the small dents and bumps on the surface of the skin disappear. D is for Detoxification Detoxification has nowadays come to be regarded as one factor to cure disease. Overeating, particularly with a high animal protein content, can lead to similar \"pollution\" within the body. This harmful bombardment forces our bodies to work extra hard to stay healthy. Further, it tends to transform our connective tissues systematically, in particular, into a regular \"waste disposal site.\" This occurs because all the substances that our bodies cannot adequately transform or excrete will be deposited temporarily within our connective tissues. There are many ways of detoxifying the tissues, of which the following have been used successfully: - annual cures using spring herbs - regular curative fasting - diet, especially reduction of animal proteins - salt baths (e. g. with natural, high-quality, unprocessed salt) - sauna treatment - intestinal cleansing - drinking plenty of good quality water - wholesome nutrition based on organic food Crystal can support detoxification processes in two ways: firstly, they help with the purification of tissues of wastes and toxins. Secondly, they encourage the excretion of these substances through the liver, kidneys, the intestine, and skin.

Consider using this crystal for acute illness cases during the period when other polluting substances are not to be released from the tissues. [Blue Chalcedony](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UTY6UQ0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00UTY6UQ0&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=3c492a559b27e2a017c7e5511d1602ed) is always a sensible choice when excretion through the skin (foul-smelling sweat) and the intestine (diarrhea) is too high. As an ancient Chinese saying puts it: What the kidneys do not excrete, is excreted by the intestine. [ Ocean Jasper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HGF7PP4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07HGF7PP4&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=a56047bbccf75eb06000e10dff255b20) can improve the discharge of waste and toxic substances while, at the same time, furthering gentle, continuous detoxification of the tissues.

[ Green Tourmaline](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CVMV851/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07CVMV851&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=b0bfaea199c359475b28e03f2c05a3db) helps with degenerative processes in the joints, nerves, and tissues caused by waste products' deposition.

Wear as a bracelet, a necklace, a polished crystal with a hole, or a pendant for long periods and place or fix a crystal (Tourmaline), a polished stone, or a liver segment in the evening. It's suggested to drink gem water. E is for Exhaustion Exhaustion occurs because of excessive strain or a lack of recovery from an illness. It signifies that one's available energy resources are used. Suppose exhaustion occurs without any apparent cause and within an otherwise normal, healthy state. In that case, one's energy must have already decreased by some other factors, e.g., some undetected physical illness or emotional burden. For short-term exhaustion caused by physical strain, an old home remedy can be applied, closely connected to the crystal therapy - a pinch of table salt on the tongue's tip.

F is for Fertility Problems A few crystals are known, even - to stimulate fertility, i. e. the procreative capacity and women's ability to conceive. If you can be specific about the cause of reduced fertility, the more purposefully and effectively these crystals can be applied. Nevertheless, as ever, the cause should always first be clarified by a specialist or doctor. Common fertility problems are disturbances in ovaries, hormonal disorders (of the pituitary gland and thyroid gland), blocked fallopian tubes (e. g. following inflammation), or a uterus disease. Common male fertility problems include trouble with sperm production, impotence, or difficulties with the sperm-conducting channel - such as inflammation of the testicles, the epididymis, prostate, or the urethra. Crystals can be a tremendous help with any impaired fertility that arises from both organic and emotional causes. However, they cannot provide a substitute for open dialogue or a healing heart to heart interchange between the affected partners.

G is for Grief Grief is the emotion that occurs with broken relationships, the loss of a loved one, rejection, unrequited love, disappointment, loss of security, or essential possessions. One of the greatest helps in connecting with grief is an attentive, discreet listener - someone to whom one can talk about everything that is causing the suffering. This way, it becomes easier to identify the real causes of what is hurting. Even if the painful circumstances do not change; as a result, the feelings of grief should then be less overwhelming. Talking it through seems to take away some of the \"enormity\" of the emotion, thereby once more creating \"space\" for the everyday aspects of life. Crystals can support overcoming grief. They help tears flow freely, help accept the inevitable, assist in talking to others about the suffering, or enable the rediscovery of what otherwise makes one happy.

Later, these may also be cracks in the skin due to permanent inflammatory states, abscesses, and extremely painful thromboses in the affected veins. In such cases, seek immediate help from a doctor. To avoid letting matters get that far, hemorrhoids should be encouraged to shrink as soon as possible. For this purpose, exercise such as regular walks, a diet rich in fiber, and - if necessary - treatment of the intestines to prevent constipation are all recommended. Agate in various forms but with a vein signature is particularly recommended for use in connection with hemorrhoids. These can be agates with circular, concentric rings (so-called Eye-Agates) that resemble cross-sections of veins or the Mexican Crazy Lace Agates with red markings, displaying the entire network veins in the rectal area correctly. Agates can be affixed above the rectum or worn in one's underwear for an external application. One can drink crystal elixir. [ Amethyst](https://gemstonewell.com/collections/frontpage/products/additional-gemstone-set-for-elixir2go-crystal-elixir-bottle?variant=5037187792923) may help relieve the itchiness and can be worn in one's underwear or be applied externally in the form of Hildegard von Bingen's [Amethyst](https://gemstonewell.com/collections/frontpage/products/additional-gemstone-set-for-elixir2go-crystal-elixir-bottle?variant=5037187792923) Water.

It furthers both the healing of the wound and the shrinkage of the hemorrhoids. I is for Immune Health Frequent infections and illnesses can indicate a weakened immune system. Therefore, it makes sense to strengthen one's immune system to avoid diseases and similar illnesses wherever possible. Naturally, a detoxification program will be required. It is worth considering alternative exercise techniques such as yoga, Tai Chi, and similar routines in the open air - as well as a regular tapping of the thymus gland (on the breastbone, between the heart and throat). Crystals can also support and help protect against illness and the regeneration of the immune system after a severe illness. [ Chrysocolla](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C5CNQHR/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07C5CNQHR&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=dadc0ed3f9d42de2bf9e40d990cc8a7b) is known to strengthen the immune system.

Heliotrope supports the immune system by neutralizing infection and limiting the disease. Emotionally, Heliotrope also furthers psychological self-protection and helps to ward off any unwanted influences.

While supporting the tissues' detoxification, it helps the immune system's ability to react to infection. It is incredibly helpful with stubborn or very debilitating illnesses, where it brings in a new impetus to the healing process. To support your immune health, wear a necklace or pendant or drink gem water (taken in small sips during the day). J is for Joint Pain Joint problems first become evident as bending and stretching pains. They are caused either by mechanical action, inflammation, or some degenerative phenomena. While such immobility can be connected with mental paralysis, problems resulting from an enforced lifestyle change is not always the case. However, whenever there is such a connection, it is essential to be aware and highlight such issues. Always consult with your doctor as joint problems can result in severe restriction of physical mobility. Two things are essential for a successful cure to joint pain: unrestricted circulation and regular detoxification. The following crystals will support both these requirements. [Apatite](https://gemstonewell.com/collections/frontpage/products/additional-gemstone-set-for-elixir2go-crystal-elixir-bottle?variant=32658629623907), especially in its blue and green forms, helps with arthrosis and regenerates damaged cartilage. (Interestingly, its chemical composition is close to that of human bone and cartilage.) Place (or fix with a bandage) a tumbled stone on the joint. Drink gem water (200-300 ml taken in small sips during the day) [Rock Crystal](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FW18GLZ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07FW18GLZ&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=8e66d8dc79ea784e3283604f93143371) cleanses the joints and helps with both arthritis and arthrosis. It relieves swelling and pain. Depending on each case's specific requirements, an unpolished crystal can be placed on the body in two different ways. If energy is required, the crystal should be placed on that side of the joint closest to the torso, but pointing towards the joint. If there is a need to draw away from superfluous energy, place the crystal on the joint's opposite side. When in doubt about what is needed, try a brief test for 60 seconds, then change. [Garnet Pyrope](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083Z2PN4D/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B083Z2PN4D&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=8c6051849f37f1e1711e012e0f233542) helps supply the joints with energy and blood, relieves pressure pains in particular, and helps both with arthritis and arthrosis. Try wearing a necklace or pendant with body contact or drink gem water. Garnet Pyrite crystals primarily help relieve pain in connection with joint problems. Nevertheless, they also cleanse the joint and, in this way, improve the effects of other crystals. They are placed directly on the painful joint or put into a small cotton bag, fixed on the joint with a bandage. Direct contact of the Pyrite with perspiration should not be allowed for too long to avoid skin irritations caused by iron sulfide compounds. [ Green Tourmaline](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M9TZ96H/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07M9TZ96H&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=6c7eef5863fcca4cd6364e947a29e410) is known as the most effective crystal for arthritis. Place a crystal along the body axis or on the joints or alongside the extremities. This stimulates the energy flow that's required for healing through the joint. Furthermore, it relieves inflammation and prevents the formation of degenerative damage (arthrosis). If no crystal handy, drink gem water. Emotionally, [Green Tourmaline](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M9TZ96H/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07M9TZ96H&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=6c7eef5863fcca4cd6364e947a29e410) also assists in creating open-mindedness, with a flexible and cheerful outlook. K is for Kidney Problems Your kidneys are the most important excretory organ. They perform functions for our well-being while maintaining our entire fluid balance of minerals, nutrients, vitamins, and hormones. Disturbances in the kidney function resulting from pain-relieving drugs or other kinds of vital medicines can lead to a considerable loss of water, minerals, nutrients, or an accumulation of toxins and waste products. Any pain near the kidneys should be examined and treated immediately by a doctor or an alternative practitioner. Indeed, never instigate any arbitrary treatment without the necessary professional knowledge! In Traditional Chinese Medicine, our central energy reserve, our life force, or chi, is regarded as being linked directly with the kidneys. So, put more conventionally; the health of the kidneys is connected directly to the well being of the whole. Thus it makes excellent sense to strengthen and support the kidney functions. In so doing, the kidneys' efficiency is maintained in their process of detoxification during general diseases (flu, colds, and mild infections) or in cases of low or high urine excretion. The most crucial action you can do is drink good, clean water without any additives such as sugar, flavoring, or stimulants! [ Chrysoprase](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GC2SD5J/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08GC2SD5J&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=699371eb4cce7871165f26ae6fb04485) and Chalcedony improve the flow of body fluids through the body. This alleviates stress on the kidneys. Therefore, these specific crystals should be applied as a precaution rather than for acute situations. Wear as a bracelet, necklace, pendant, or drink lots of gem water.

Place a tumbled stone, sections or slices, on the area over both kidneys - or wear as a bracelet, necklace, pendant, or gem water. L is for Liver Health The function of your liver is to cleanse and store. It contributes to the detoxification process and produces essential proteins for the body. It accumulates many vital substances, such as glycogen and red blood corpuscles. The consequences of a weak liver is a weakened total organism (\"tiredness is the pain of the liver\") with lowered resistance to infection and other symptoms indicative of insufficient detoxification and regeneration. Therefore, it is clear that maintaining a healthy liver leads to better physical harmony and improved emotional states and general equilibrium. The following crystals can have a positive influence on this process.

It stimulates all liver functions and furthers the cleansing and regeneration of the organ itself. Especially useful for detoxification. The copper silicate, [Dioptase](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N8QYDNP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01N8QYDNP&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=d081f48c03fb8b18b668b9ba4ae10ff0), has a refreshing effect on the liver. It's most effective if placed directly over the liver. It stimulates the liver's cleansing function, aiding the organ itself, and processes are driven by liver metabolism and liver energy in other parts of the body (e. g. in the eyes, the spinal discs, and the menisci). [Emerald](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HISXRQU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01HISXRQU&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=655fbc1b2347d86575054d0c17d56f43) furthers the healing when coping with liver disease.

It can help with the detoxification process and regeneration of cells. Place a crystal; a tumbled stone, or a flat slice/section of any of the above on the liver every night, or, if more comfortable, use sticking plaster to affix it to the area for a longer time. An alternative is to drink gem water. M is for Menopause These hormonal changes, caused by a decreased estrogen generation, can cause challenges for middle-aged women. Some of the common symptoms are: - Irregular bleeding - Hot flushes - Red skin - Heavy perspiration - Disturbed heart rhythm - Dizziness - Prickling sensations in limbs - Lack of sleep - Irritability - Reduced levels of performance - Fear and depression - Weight gain - Osteoporosis Doctors, therefore, usually administer estrogen to slow the process or to deal with these symptoms. Alternative practitioners go the opposite way. They ensure that the hormonal change consequences are offset by a conscious, natural way of life: a balanced diet; avoidance of alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine; regular physical exercise; gym, swimming; and contrast baths. All of these measures may offset the problems mentioned above.

Wear this crystal as a bracelet, necklace, pendant. Or drink gem water. N is for Nausea Nausea is caused by stomach or intestinal diseases, over-eating, alcohol, poisoning, sunstroke, travel sickness, migraine, various kinds of inflammation, smells, grief, or nerve and brain diseases.

O is for Osteoporosis Reduced bone mass and bone structure is the cause of osteoporosis. Women are prone to the condition as it commonly occurs with hormonal changes (menopause). A lack or deficiency of calcium and vitamin D, plus particular medication (such as cortisone), can also be a significant factor when body tissue excesses toxic deposits. Overall, metabolism is thus impeded, and together with insufficient physical exercise, this also can contribute to osteoporosis. Detoxification, which includes a diet without animal protein but rich in calcium and vitamin D, and appropriate physical activity, is crucial in avoiding osteoporosis. Crystals with significant calcium content such as [Apatite](https://gemstonewell.com/collections/frontpage/products/additional-gemstone-set-for-elixir2go-crystal-elixir-bottle?variant=32658629623907), [Aragonite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0094B07ZE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0094B07ZE&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=16975d94a954d5c3d6f88a63acf2fd4e), [Calcite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UC6KSEK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00UC6KSEK&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=65826b765ae33d88f5fdc5e38b0c10c4), and [Fluorite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GHDQZQK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08GHDQZQK&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=f96b6b55bc9dae1c5a0180c7daaad47c), stimulate the body's calcium metabolism and encourage bone growth and health.

In turn, the metabolism then supplies the calcium to the body and boosts the skeleton's strengthening. All four crystals complement each other perfectly well and can also be applied together. Wear them as a necklace or pendant for a more extended period, with direct body contact. Besides, drink gem water with these crystals. R is for Revitalization/Regeneration Revitalization or \"regeneration\" (Latin: regenerate \"rebirth\") - is a return to an original, healthy, and harmonious state of well being. Physically, regeneration means renewal or rejuvenation of our cells, tissue, and organs. Sleep provides us with our most important period of regeneration. Healthy food rich in vitamins, daily walks, relaxing baths, and time on one's own is essential in this revitalization process. Crystals that speed up the regeneration and revitalization processes can be very supportive - although without applying for the above self-healing programs, they cannot by themselves bring about a full recovery, and their use alone will only have a short-term effect.

In this way, it contributes to fundamental cell renewal and physical revival. Besides, it fortifies liver function and provides both physical and energetic improvement. In parallel, it also strengthens emotional renewal and brings new hope and courage and has even been described as the \"crystal bringing with it the energy of waking up on a spring day.\" [Rutile Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TTANHO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003TTANHO&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=57d9c7b738f0874cf049792d3d66b6d2) furthers cellular renewal and thus also the regeneration power in all cells and organs. Besides, it brings hope during challenging periods, when everything seems dark and hard to take. It helps one to \"think big\" and view the actual situation from a more subjective perspective. [Zoisite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TT8HFO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003TT8HFO&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=bafc36413cf7ad753921212510ea7890), especially forms containing Ruby, encourages regeneration during cells and tissue sleep after inflammation or severe illness. It enhances recovery from any exhausting, strength-draining efforts or experiences. For all of the above, wear as a bracelet, necklace, pendant, or drink gem water. They may all complement and enhance the effect of other relevant crystals during the overall healing process. S is for Sight Problems Weak or impaired sight is typified by an extreme reduction in the sharpness of vision. Typical causes are disease in the retina, blurring of the lenses, or impaired formation of the so-called \"yellow spot\" (the point upon the retina, where the eye is sharpest) and disturbances in the nerves or the brain's sight center. In turn, the latter may be connected with varying or unequal vision in the eyes or squinting. Weakened sight is not a disease in itself. Instead, it is a symptom of the consequence of many, often complex, causes. Previous research has proven there is a close connection between the eyes and a healthy liver. Your priority is to start eating a sensible diet and drink clean water. [Agate crystal](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BNJL3B7/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08BNJL3B7&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=fd2538f90278944ff7a56afa88c5309a) containing an eye signature is incredibly helpful in connection with diseases of the retina or choroids and any blurred vision. Agate sections/ slices or a tumbled stone with prominent inclusions of Rock Crystal are exceptionally recommended and be placed on the eyes regularly for about 15 minutes (evenings are best). [Rock Crystal](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FW18GLZ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07FW18GLZ&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=8e66d8dc79ea784e3283604f93143371) is incredibly helpful in the early stages of blurring. Place a small crystal, or a tumbled stone directly on the closed eyelids. The clear, bright so-termed \"Herkimer Diamonds\" are particularly suitable. [Chalcedony](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UTY6UQ0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00UTY6UQ0&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=3c492a559b27e2a017c7e5511d1602ed) and Noble Opal improves the fluid regulation of the eye. They are helpful in cases of blurred vision and some diseases in the retina. [Chrysoberyl](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082VGPQZX/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B082VGPQZX&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=22e4cd6e64a7f36d47f84056392c8c71) is helpful with impaired vision, mainly if the latter is caused by disturbances of the optic nerve or the brain's sight center. Place a crystal between the eyebrows three times a day for about 15 minutes. Diamond will reduce toxins' accumulation around the eye, particularly if taken in the form of gem water (200-300 ml taken in small sips over the day). Diamonds can be placed directly on the closed eyes or between the eyebrows as a supplementary treatment. [ Dioptase](https://www.healing-crystals-for-you.com/dioptase.html) usually is connected with the liver. It can have a positive effect on the eyes. If you have impaired vision, place a small crystal or a small group of crystals directly onto the liver. [Dioptase](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N8QYDNP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01N8QYDNP&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=d081f48c03fb8b18b668b9ba4ae10ff0) eye drops applied simultaneously heighten the beneficial effect of the body's metabolism on the eyes.

In such cases, it can also be worn in the form of a necklace or pendant, be placed on the liver, or be taken in gem water. Being a tri-colored Chalcedony and an Agate-related mineral, [Sardonyx](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GYJQV1T/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08GYJQV1T&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=78c60d9a0ed2f8bece4317034bf7565d) is also the best and most crucial crystal in weak sight and impaired vision. It affects all the affected areas such as eye metabolism, retina, choroid, eye nerves, and the brain. With its various color varieties (blue, pink, green, and watermelon), Tourmaline is incredibly helpful when impaired vision is caused by nerve damage. Take a crystal or a tumbled stone directly on the eyes or drink gem water. T is for Throat Pain Common causes are straining the voice, irritation (e. g. cigarette smoke), thyroid, gland problems, and infections (diseases in the airways, sore throat). Another common cause is emotional stress (holding something back and the resulting tenseness of something unspoken and \"stuck in our throats\"). Dislocated cervical vertebrae, tensed neck muscles, jaw tension and dislocations, abnormal occlusion, or teeth problems are other causes not as easily recognized. The throat has a connection with the lymphatic system and intestines as the mucous often takes over the detoxification job that the intestines or the lymph cannot cope with. Allergies, especially food allergies, can hamper the problem. Intestinal cleansing is crucial when you have acute throat pains. A consultation with a professional for medical diagnosis is highly recommended. Crystals can relieve acute throat symptoms. [Apophyllite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007C31CWS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007C31CWS&linkCode=as2&tag=yourlifest06a-20&linkId=2b1c2fa7cada9728556c170ea25cacf9) helps a sore throat from developing into bronchitis.

V is for Vomiting Not an illness in itself, vomiting is a symptom with various causes. Vomiting can also be caused by, among other things, the following; congestion and irritation of the stomach (e.g., because of alcohol), general feverish illnesses (particularly in children), stomach/intestinal diseases, gall bladder colic, metabolic disorders, various types of inflammation, poisoning or migraine. Besides, unpleasant experiences, smells, disgust, shocking images or sights, etc. may also result in vomiting.

W is for Warts Warts are virus-based growths that show up on the skin. They can be contagious if a tendency toward the formation of warts is present. Flat warts are soft, round, mall knots, which often occur in relatively large numbers, but only cause little discomfort. Popular and home-based folk remedies for their treatment include moistening the wart with one's urine (for several weeks!), the use of oil of red thyme and tea tree, or fixing a clove of garlic with sticking plaster directly on the wart.
