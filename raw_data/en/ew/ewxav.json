The construction and operation of ITER will represent the fulf illment of a decades-long undertaking to demonstrate the technical feasibility of fusi on power, building on a remarkable period of progress, scientific achievement and discovery. At the same time, it is clear that ITER will not resolve all of the scientific and technical questions that remain on the road toward practical fusion energy. For the U.S. to exploit the knowledge gained on ITER, it is worthwhile to consider other research activitie s, to be carried out in parallel with and following the ITER project. This report su mmarizes a six month study of opportunities available to the program as it considers the pa th from ITER, toward Demo. It seeks to answer the charge given to FESAC by undersecretary Orbach in March 2007. \"To assist planning for the ITER era, it is critic al that FESAC identify the issues arising in a path to DEMO, with ITER as a central part of that effort 1. Identify and prioritize the broad scientific and technical questions to be answered prior to a DEMO. 2. Assess available means (inventory), including all existing and planned facilities around the world, as well as theory and modeling, to address these questions. 3. Identify research gaps and how they may be addressed through new facility concepts, theory and modeling.\" The charge assumed a fusion energy development scenario with a direct path from ITER to Demo based on the tokamak and its low-aspect ratio and advanced variants. Stellarator issues were also reviewed, as it is the next most developed concept and operates intrinsically steady-state and without disruptions - two critical issues for the tokamak. The charge asked for priorities, but did not ask for a review of th e entire program. In particular, it did not ask the panel to assess the research program nece ssary to make ITER and U.S. participation a success, though it is clear that th is is the top priority of the U.S. program. Other elements, such as inertial confinement, were excluded and alternate magnetic concepts were considered only to the extent that they could influence or facilitate, in a significant way, the main-line sequence from ITER to Demo. The charge anticipated additional planning activities that would consider specific major facilities and programs and include parts of the program not within the scope of this one. Comparative judgments have not been made between the activities covered in this repor t and those excluded from consideration. The scope of this report extends over severa l decades, but the panel's main intent is to inform decisions about major next steps in th e U.S. program. In the report, we hope to provide the groundwork for those decisions, to lay out options and to place the near-term 6research program into the context of long-term needs and directions. Long-term plans will certainly be reviewed and revised many times before a fusion reactor is proposed. Finally, while the charge is placed in an international context, it seeks avenues for U.S. leadership and challenges our community to be ready for a Demo built in the U.S. if and when that decision is made. The panel sought to identify th e scientific questions and t echnical challenges likely to remain after the successful completion of curr ent and planned research, including ITER, and to formulate major research initiatives that c ould answer those questions and confront those challenges. Consistent with the overall mission of the Offi ce of Fusion Energy, the aim was to outline new program elements that are requi red to provide the knowledge base to enable an eventual step to Demo. In addressing the ch arge, the panel: 1) Identified 15 broad scientific questions , organized into three general themes (Findings 1 and 2). 2) Prioritized these issues as to their importance for fusion energy, urgency and generality (Finding 3) 3) Analyzed the full breadth of the world program including specific missions and capabilities of major f acilities (Finding 4) 4) Assessed U.S. strengths and opportunities (Finding 5) 5) Summarized gaps in our knowledge on a path to Demo (Finding 6) 6) Identified research activities that could fill the gaps (Chapter 4) A full and detailed set of findi ngs can be found in the following chapter. Technical backup is provided in chapters 2-4. The panel found that remarkable progress has be en made by the program. The approach has been based on developing the underlying scien tific bases and a significant predictive capability. It is worth quoting a pa ssage from the recent NRC report, Plasma Science: Advancing Knowledge in the National Interest , \"The scientific oppo rtunities in magnetic fusion science are compelling, intellectually challenging, and a direct product of the scientific focus of the U.S. magnetic fusion program over the past decade.\" At the same time, we recognize significant chal lenges that remain and have outlined those in this report. And while the issues in front of us are at least as difficult as those that have been overcome, the panel is optimistic about the prospects for resolving remaining issues, given adequate resources. As such, the panel recommends: 1) A long-term and detailed st rategic plan should be de veloped and implemented as soon as possible to meet the challenges iden tified in this report. The plan should include metrics to prioritize research, scie ntific milestones to judge progress, and should identify ways to educate and tr ain a new generation of scientists. 2) The plan should recognize and address al l scientific challe nges of fusion energy including fusion engineering, materi als sciences and plasma physics. 7 3) Such a plan should include bold step s and encourage adoption of major new initiatives or construction of new facilities in order to resolve scientific challenges. 4) The panel has identified 9 potential initia tives, ranging from targeted research on key topics in fusion science and engineering to large, inte grated plasma experiments exploring aspects of the fu sion reactor environment. The detailed set of recommendations can be found in the following chapter. 8 9 Summary Of Findings And Recommendations Findings Charge 1 requires that we identify the broad scie ntific and technical qu estions that must be answered before we are ready to proceed to De mo. Together, these questions should define the challenges ahead and set the long-term research agenda for the U.S. In carrying out its work, the panel reviewed all aspects of fusi on systems that would be required for Demo, attempted to identify all of the critical issues , then organized these into logical categories. The panel also recognized a se t of overarching issues, which were entwined with almost all of the others and which, in many cases, explicitly or implicitly drive research in other areas. The overarching issues describe necessary characteristics of an overall fusion system and include availability, maintainability , reliability, economics and safety. Finding 1. Achieving the required state of knowledge The panel found that remarkable progress has been made by the program but recognized that formidable challenges remain. While the issues in front of us are at least as difficult as those that have been overcome, the panel is optimistic about the prospects for resolving remaining issues, given adequate resources. Finding 2. Broad scientific and technical questions The panel identified a set of scientific a nd technical questions organized into three broad themes. The themes were defined in terms of knowledge required prior to Demo. In the definitions, we insist that the knowledge gained must be based on sound scientific principles and rigorously tested in the labora tory so that the step to a demonstration power reactor would be taken with high confidence of success. Similarly, each question was accompanied by a concrete definition and substantial backup detail (which can be found in chapter 2.) The particular decomposition and organization of issues chosen is clearly not unique, but was designed to aid in answering subsequent parts of the charge. The themes and questions identified were: Theme A. Creating predictable high -performance steady-state plasmas: The state of knowledge must be sufficient for the constr uction, with high confidence, of a device that permits the creation of sustained pl asmas that meet simultaneously, all the conditions required for practica l production of fusion energy. 1. Measurement: Make advances in sensor hardware, procedures and algorithms for measurements of a ll necessary plasma quantities with sufficient coverage and accura cy needed for the scientific mission, especially plasma control. 10 2. Integration of high-performan ce, steady-state, burning plasmas: Create and conduct research, on a routine basis, of high performance core, edge and SOL plasmas in steady-state with the combined performance characteristics required for Demo. 3. Validated Theory and Predictive Modeling: Through developments in theory and modeling and ca reful comparison with experiments, develop a set of computational models that are capabl e of predicting all important plasma behavior in the regimes and geometries relevant for practical fusion energy. 4. Control: Investigate and establish sche mes for maintaining high- performance, burning plasmas at a desire d, multivariate operating point with a specified accuracy for l ong periods, without disr uption or other major excursions. (Provision for sensors is included under issue 1 a nd for actuators under issue 6.) 5. Off-normal Plasma Events: Understand the underlying physics and control of high-performance magnetically confined plasmas sufficiently so that 'off- normal' plasma operation, which could c ause catastrophic fa ilure of internal components, can be avoided with high reliability and/or develop approaches that allow the devices to tolerate some number or frequency of these events. (Because of their implications and impor tance, these 'off-normal events' are called out separately from the control issues listed above). 6. Plasma Modification by Auxiliary Systems: Establish the physics and engineering science of auxiliary systems that c an provide power, particles, current and rotation at the appropriat e locations in the plasma at the appropriate intensity. 7. Magnets: Understand the engineering and materials science needed to provide economic, robust, reliable, maintainable magnets for plasma confinement, stability and control. Theme B. Taming the Plasma Material Interface: The state of knowledge must be sufficient to design and build, with high con fidence, robust material components that interface the hot plasma in the pr esence of very high neutron fluences. 8. Plasma-Wall Interactions: Understand and control of all processes that couple the plasma and nearby materials. 9. Plasma Facing Components: Understand the materials and processes that can be used to design replaceable co mponents that can survive the enormous heat, plasma and neutron fluxes without degrading the performance of the plasma or compromising the fuel cycle. 1110. RF Antennas, Launching Structur es and Other Internal Components: Establish the necessary understanding of plasma interactions, neutron loading and materials to a llow design of RF antennas and launchers, control coils, final optics and any other diagnos tic equipment that can survive and function within the plasma vessel. Theme C. Harnessing fusion power: The state of knowledge must be sufficient to design and build, with high confidence, robus t and reliable systems that can convert fusion products to useful forms of energy in a reactor environment, including a self- sufficient supply of tritium fuel. 11. Fusion Fuel Cycle: Learn and test how to manage the flow of tritium throughout the entire plant, in cluding breeding and recovery. 12. Power Extraction: Understand how to extract fusion power at temperatures sufficiently high for ef ficient production of electricity or hydrogen. 13. Materials Science in the Fusion Environment: Understand the basic materials science for fusion breeding blankets, structural components, plasma diagnostics and heating compone nts in high neutron fluence areas. 14. Safety: Demonstrate the safety and envi ronmental poten tial of fusion power to preclude the tec hnical need for a public evacuation plan, and to minimize the environmental burdens of radioactive waste, mixed waste, or chemically toxic waste for future generations. 15. Reliability, Availability, Main tainability and Inspectability: Demonstrate the productive capacity of fusion powe r and validate economic assumptions about plant operations by rivaling ot her electrical energy production technologies. The first charge also asked for prioritization of the issues that had been identified. While not defining precisely what was meant by the term, it seems clear that the charge was seeking guidance on which areas would benefit most from additional emphasis or investment. As the panel developed the list of issues, it was cl ear that none were unimportant and that all would have to be resolved even tually. Thus it is crucial fo r readers to understand that the panel's judgments on priorities should not be taken as a recommendation to abandon certain broad lines of research. Rather, they are m eant to inform decisions concerning which areas to stress now. Some level of research w ill be needed in all key areas to ensure the knowledge required for a step toward Demo is available. Finding 3. Priorities All the issues listed above must be a ddressed and resolved before Demo. What distinguishes them is the timeline required to obtain answers, uncertainties about which paths would lead to success and the amount of effort that will be needed. The 12panel notes the desire of program managers to maximize the speed with which commercial fusion energy is attained, while minimizing overall risk within a realistic budget. The aim of the prioritization is to provide guidance on which areas to stress and the timing for the most productive investments, noting that some ongoing effort is required in all of the areas identified. It is also important to note that since there are many important interactions and coupli ngs between the issues, they cannot be addressed in complete isolation. The panel ranked the issues using three criteria: 1. Importance: Importance for the fusion ener gy mission and the degree of extrapolation from the curre nt state of knowledge 2. Urgency: Based on level of activity requi red now and in the near future. 3. Generality: Degree to which resolution of the issue would be generic across different designs or approaches for Demo. After evaluation, the issues were grouped into three tiers, with the tiers defined to suggest an overall judgment on the state of knowledge an d the relative requirement and timeliness for more intense research for each issue. The results of prioritization were: Tier 1: solution not in hand, major extr apolation from current state of knowledge, need for qualitative impro vements and substantial development for both short and long term Plasma Facing Components Materials Tier 2: solutions foreseen but not yet ac hieved, major extrapolation from current state of knowledge, need for qualitative improvements and substantial development for long term Off -normal events Fuel cycle Plasma-wall interactions Integrated, high performance burning plasmas Power extraction Theory and Predictive modeling Measurement Tier 3: solutions foreseen but not yet ac hieved, moderate extrapolation from current state of knowledge, need for quantitative improvements and substantial development for long term RF launchers and other internal components Plasma modification by auxiliary systems Control Safety and environment Magnets 13 To answer charge 2, the panel gathered information on the missions, capabilities and schedules for current and planned programs, th en evaluated U.S. st rengths and opportunities to contribute in each of the 14 broad areas. Wh ile it was clear that th e international program is very strong and that unnecessa ry duplication should be avoide d, the panel felt that the U.S. should not shrink from competing wher e we have the abilit y to make strong contributions. We evaluated the U.S. position w ith respect to four ques tions. 1. What were areas of current and historical U.S. strength or leadership? 2. In what areas was the U.S. in greatest danger of losing leadership or competitiveness given current trends? 3. What were areas where the U.S. had an opportu nity to sustain leadership by strategic investment? 4. In what areas could the U.S. gain leadership by making significant new investments? Finding 4. Scope of world program The panel noted that the issues identified in this report were widely recognized in the domestic and international fusion progr ams, providing ample opportunities to collaborate on their resolution. However, the U.S. fraction of the world program is decreasing and the ability to partner effectively or to co mpete for leadership may be threatened in the future wit hout adequate U.S. investment. Finding 5. U.S. Strengths and opportunities The panel assessed current U.S. strength an d tried to identify areas where additional investment would be most effective with respect to the international program. a) In evaluating areas of current strength, the panel felt that the U.S. could claim leadership in: Measurement Theory and Predictive modeling Control b) That the U.S. was strongly competitive in: Plasma wall interactions Integrated, sustained, high-performance plasmas Safety/environment c) That the U.S. was at risk of losing leadership or competitiveness in many areas, particularly: Measurement Control Antennas and launchers Materials Integrated, sustained, high-performance plasmas Plasma-wall interactions and Plasma facing components Safety Magnets d) That there were areas where investment could sustain strength: Measurement Theory and Predictive modeling Control 14Plasma-wall interactions e) That investment could provide ne w opportunities for U.S. leadership in: Plasma facing components Materials f) That while there are major world res earch efforts to avoid off-normal plasma events in tokamaks, U.S. strengths in three-dimensional physics and modeling provide an opportunity for an alternate reso lution of this issue via exploitation of quasi-symmetric helical shaping. g) That there was, nonetheless, a need to ma intain core competencies in all relevant areas. Clearly the U.S. will be working w ith and relying on foreign programs for the foreseeable future, however, maintaining some level of core competency in all areas is a prerequisite for effective partnership a nd a necessity if the U.S. is to build the knowledge base for a step to Demo. As the set of broad questions was developed in response to the first part of the charge, considerable detail was amassed concerning the scie ntific and technical issues that will need to be addressed and the extra polation required from the cu rrent state of knowledge. To address charge 3, these finer-scale issues were considered in light of existing and planned programs and a fine-granularity se t of gaps was compiled. This list represents gaps in our knowledge that are likely to remain, with some reasonable probability, even after completion of the world-wide research program th at is currently underway or in the pipeline. Success for the basic ITER mission was assumed, but it is not possible, of course, to predict with certainty, the results of scientific research, so this assessment represents only the best guesses and judgments of the panel. Finding 6. Evaluation of current a nd planned programs and summary of gaps By considering extrapolations in our scie ntific and technical understanding and in machine performance in all of the identified areas, and comparing these against the research plans in current and planned program s, the panel derived a set of gaps in our knowledge base that would likel y remain when all of thes e programs were complete. (Details for this analysis can be found in chapters 2, 3 and 4.) The gaps were first compiled at a fine level of granularity (section 4b) then consolidated into 15 categories. These areas are similar, but not identical, to the list of scientific questions found in chapter 2, however there is a crucial distinction between the two sets. The consolidated gaps have been heavily filtered by considering expected progress, leaving a smaller subset of each or iginal issue. This difference can only be fully appreciated by carefully reading s ection 4d, which summarizes the residual issues in each category. The most significant gaps were: G-1. Sufficient understanding of all ar eas of the underlying plasma physics to predict the performance and optimize the design and operation of future devices. Areas likely to require additional research include turbulent transport and multi-scale, multi-physics coupling. 15G-2. Demonstration of integrated, st eady-state, high-performance (advanced) burning plasmas, including first wall a nd divertor interact ions. The main challenge is combining high fusion gain with the strategies needed for steady- state operation. G-3. Diagnostic techniques suitable for control of steady-state advanced burning plasmas that are compatible with the nuclear environment of a reactor. The principle gap here is in developing measurement techniques that can be used in the hostile environment of a fusion reactor. G-4. Control strategies for high-performance burning plasmas, running near operating limits, with auxiliary systems providing only a small fraction of the heating power and current drive. Innovative strategies will be required to implement control in high-Q burning plas ma where almost all of the power and the current drive is generated by the plasma itself. G-5. Ability to predict and avoid, or detect and mitigate, off-normal plasma events that could challenge the integrity of fusion devices. G-6. Sufficient understanding of altern ative magnetic configurations that have the ability to operate in steady- state without off-normal plasma events. These must demonstrate, through theory and experiment, that they can meet the performance requirements to extrapolat e to a reactor and th at they are free from off-normal events or other phenomena that would lower their availability or suitability for fusion power applications. G-7. Integrated understanding of RF la unching structures and wave coupling for scenarios suitable for Demo and comp atible with the nuclear and plasma environment. The stresses on launching structures for ICRH or LHCD in a high radiation, high heat-flux environmen t will require designs that are less than optimal from the point of view of wave physics and that may require development of new RF techniques, new materials and new cooling strategies. G-8. The knowledge base required to model and build low and high-temperature superconducting magnet sy stems that provide robust, cost- effective magnets (at higher fields if required). G-9. Sufficient understanding of all pl asma-wall interactions necessary to predict the environment for, and behavior of, plasma facing and other internal components for Demo conditions. The science underlying the interaction of plasma and material needs to be significantly strengthened to allow prediction of erosion and re-deposition rates, tritium retention, dust production and damage to the first wall. G-10. Understanding of the use of low activation solid and liquid materials, joining technologies and cooling strate gies sufficient to design robust first- 16wall and divertor components in a hi gh heat flux, steady-state nuclear environment. Particularly challenging issues will include tritium permeation and retention, embrittlement and loss of heat conduction. G-11. Understanding the elements of th e complete fuel cycle, particularly efficient tritium breeding, retention, recovery and separation in vessel components. G-12. An engineering science base for th e effective removal of heat at high temperatures from first wall and breeding components in the fusion environment. G-13. Understanding the evolving propert ies of low activation materials in the fusion environment relevant for stru ctural and first wall components. This will include the effects of materials chemistry and tritium permeation at high-temperatures. Important properties like dimensional stability, phase stability, thermal conductivity, fracture toughness, yield strength and ductility must be characterized as a function of neutron bombardment at very high levels of atomic displacement with concomitant high levels of transmutant helium and hydrogen. G-14. The knowledge base for fusion sy stems sufficient to guarantee safety over the plant life cycle - including licensing and commissioning, normal operation, off-normal events a nd decommissioning/disposal. G-15. The knowledge base for effici ent maintainability of in-vessel components to guarantee the availability goals of Demo are achievable. Finding 7. Mitigation of programmati c risks through breadth of program including international collaboration The principle strategy to mitigate risk is to implement a sufficiently broad program so that alternative approaches or tec hnologies are available at each step. Any research program, no matter how carefully planned may not provide the information or knowledge at the time it is needed to take the next logical step in development. One goal of a strategic plan for fusion would be to maximize the chance that the required information is available by providi ng deep scientific foundations for the necessary disciplines and by pursuing multiple research paths where uncertainties are greatest. It is clear that there is a dire ct trade-off between risks and costs and that budgets will always require making choices ab out which lines of research to follow. One important set of choices for the U.S. program involves decidi ng which issues to address through international collaborat ion and which to take on itself. Finding 8. Importance of ma intaining support for ITER Success on ITER must be the overall top priority for the fusion program. While considering the recommendations in this report, the panel reiterates the importance of maintaining support for ITER within its domestic program. 17 Recommendations The panel wanted to go on record as suppor ting the development of a comprehensive strategic plan for MFE and encouraged the bold ne w vision that is implicit in the charge. It was also apparent to the panel, that fundament al physical sciences research will be required to answer the challenges cont ained in areas traditionally designated as \"technology\". The panel urges that these areas not be overlooked in future planning exercises. These areas are also critical as enablers of fusion plasma res earch as they expand options for design of new experiments. Recommendation 1. A long-term strategic plan should be developed and implemented as soon as possible to begin addressing the gaps identified in this report. Such a plan should include metrics to priori tize research areas, scientific milestones to judge the progress, and should identi fy means to educate and train a new generation of scientists. Recommendation 2. Such a strategic plan should recognize and address all scientific challenges of fusion energy including fusion engineering, materials sciences and plasma physics. It is clear from the identification of issues, priorities and gaps that there are many important scientific questions that are no t directly or entirely related to plasma physics. Well before we ar e prepared for the step to Demo, a comprehensive research program will be needed to answer these questions. Of particular importance would be ongoing research to explore innova tive approaches in many areas. The fusion program can't wait until the detail ed design of new experiments has begun, since options must be available as plans are formulated. Recommendation 3. A long-term strategic plan needs to include bold steps The panel encourages the adoption of new initiatives or the construction of new facilities that are vital in filling the gaps identified in this report and that can hold their own in the inte rnational arena. To complete work on charge 3, the panel derived a lengthy set of \"mission elements\" from the compilation of gaps. These are research ac tivities, usually many mo re than one per gap, which could provide the required knowledge base. From these, a set of major initiatives is proposed, each representing an oppor tunity, with appropriate inve stment, for U.S. leadership in the world program. Most could be carried out with substantial international collaboration, or could be led by an international partner with substantial U.S. involvement. Each makes a dominant contribution to at least one of the identified ga ps and typically secondary contributions to several others. A sense of th e priority of each initiative can be gained by considering the priorities of the i ssues that are addressed. In some cases more than one initiative is listed to address a particular gap. For example, a major effort to enhance the advanced tokama k program on ITER has a similar goal as a new 18major facility aimed at investigating the sa me science. Only one of these would be necessary, in our judgment, to provide the in formation required to go forward with a Demo based on AT physics. The choice between th e alternatives would be based on technical, political and economic factors. It may be al so possible or desirable to combine the missions of two or more of the facilities listed below into a single, larger in itiative, though only after careful consideration of costs a nd benefits. The potential for each initiative to fill identified gaps is summarized in figure 1. Recommendation 4. The development of a long-t erm strategic plan should include careful consideration of th e following nine major initiatives. [note these are not listed in priority order] I-1. Initiative toward predictive plasma modeling and validation This activity describes a coordinated program that would combine major advances in theory based plasma simulations, especially multi-scale, multi-physics issues combined with a vigorous effort to validate these models against large and small-scale experiment s. A critical element would be the development and deployment of new measurement techniques. I-2. Extensions to ITER AT capabilities This initiative would entail new or enhanced drivers (heating, current drive, etc.), control tools and diagnostics cap able of carrying out a comprehensive AT physics program. The aim would be to achieve an understanding of burning AT regimes sufficient to base Demo on. I-3. Integrated advanced bur ning physics demonstration This facility would be a dedicated sustained, high-performance burning plasma experiment with a goal to achi eve an understanding sufficient to base Demo on. It is predicated on the cond ition that extensions to the ITER AT program and predictive understanding from the international superconducting tokamaks will not achieve an understanding sufficient for extrapolation to Demo. I-4. Integrated experiment for plasma wall interactions and plasma facing components This very-long pulse or steady-state confinement experiment would perform research on plasma wall interactions and plasma facing components in a non- DT integrated facility. It would atte mpt to duplicate and study, as closely as possible, all of the issues and (non- nuclear) problems that PWI/PFCs would face in a reactor. I-5. Advanced experiment in disruption-free concepts This would be a performance extension device for a concept that had demonstrated promise for fusion applications by projecting to high performance and efficient steady stat e, and which was significantly less 19susceptible to off-normal events compared to a tokamak. A stellarator would be the mostly likely candidate for such a facility. I-6. Engineering and materials physics modeling and experimental validation initiative This would be a coordinated and comp rehensive research program consisting of advanced computer modeling and labor atory testing aimed at establishing the single-effects science for majo r fusion technology issues, including materials, plasma-wall interactions , plasma-facing components, joining technologies, super-conducting magnets, tritium breeding, RF and fueling systems. I-7. Materials qualification facility This initiative would involve testi ng and qualification of low-activation materials by intense neutron bombardment. The facility generally associated with this mission is the Internationa l Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF). The potential for alternative irradiation facilities to reduce or possibly eliminate the need for the US to participate as a full partner in IFMIF needs to be assessed. I-8. Component development and testing program This would entail coordinated research and development for multi-effect issues in critical technology areas. Ex amples are breeding/blanket modules and first wall components but this init iative could include other important components like magnet systems or RF launchers. This program would most likely be carried out as enabling research in direct preparation and support of planned nuclear fusion facilities such as ITER, CTF or Demo. I-9. Component qualification facility This facility is aimed at testing and validating plasma and nuclear technologies in a high availability, hi gh heat flux, high neutron fluence DT device. It would qualify components for Demo and establish the basis for licensing. In fusion energy development plans, this machine is called a Component Test Facility (CTF). 20 How Initiatives Could Address Gaps Legend Major Contribution 3 Significant Contribution 2 Minor Contribution 1 No Important Contribution G-1 Plasma Predictive capability G-2 Integrated plasma demonstration G-3 Nuclear-capable Diagnostics G-4 Control near limits with minimal power G-5 Avoidance of Large-scale Off- normal events in tokamaks G-6 Developments for concepts free of off-normal plasma events G-7 Reactor capable RF launching structures G-8 High-Performance Magnets G-9 Plasma Wall Interactions G-10 Plasma Facing Components G-11 Fuel cycle G-12 Heat removal G-13 Low activation materials G-14 Safety G-15 Maintainability I-1.

To what extent does each proposed initia tives (rows) address the important gaps (columns) 21 Chapter 1 Introduction and Background 1.a. Discussion of Charge With the approval of ITER, the magnetic fu sion program has entered an exciting new era in which scientific and technological progress, gained over long years of research, will be brought to fruition. At the same time, it is und erstood that ITER will not resolve all of the issues in front of us. In this context, FE SAC has been charged to identify gaps still remaining in the international program and major program elements which could augment existing and planned activities in building the knowledge base required for fusion energy. The relevant porti on of the charge letter reads: \"To assist planning for the ITER era, it is critical that FESAC identify the issues arising in a path to Demo, with ITER as a central part of that effort\" 1. Identify and prioritize the broad scie ntific and technical questions to be answered prior to a Demo. 2. Assess available means (inventory), including all existing and planned facilities around the world, as well as theory and modeling, to address these questions. 3. Identify research gaps and how they may be addressed through new facility concepts, theory and modeling.\" These questions ask in effect, \"what do we ne ed to learn and what do we need to do, aside from ITER and other current programs, so that we would be prepared to take the s t e p t o D e m o ? \" T h i s i s n o t a n e x e r c i se in designing or planning Demo, but in identifying the knowledge base that Demo w ould be based on and outlining the research program necessary to obtain it. It is und erstood that the panel's efforts are meant primarily to inform near-term decisions about major next steps in the U.S. program. Long-term plans will certainly be revis ited many times before a fusion reactor is proposed. However, in taking the next step, it is prudent to consider the entire path. Finally, while the charge is placed in an in ternational context, it seeks opportunities for U.S. leadership and challenges the program to be ready for a Demo built in the U.S. if and when that decision comes from policy makers. The panel viewed this as an opportunity to expand our vision for the fusi on program and to look toward a future where the U.S. is at the forefront of this critical and exciting field. 1.b. Scope of the Panel's Work In discussions with program leaders from OFES and OSC, the scope and boundaries of the charge were clarified. The charge was meant to cover a \"mainline\", two-step 22approach to fusion with ITER followed by Demo as the major elements. In defining gaps in the fusion research program, the panel assumes that ITER will successfully carry out its burning plasma mission. Demo is intended as a pre-commercial, electricity-producing reactor, demonstrating high av ailability and all relevant technologies and realizing the environmental and safety features inherent in fusion. A more complete discussion of Demo can be found below in section 1.d. The charge foresees no other reactor-scale device intervening between ITER and De mo, though smaller, but still significant facilities, may be required. The charge asks the panel to assume that ongoing and planned research, including I TER, meet its basic objectives, but recognizes that these programs, by themselves, will not provide answ ers to all the scientific and technological questions that we face on the road to practic al fusion energy. (Summaries of the missions, capabilities and plans for majo r facilities and research pr ojects in the international program are detailed in chapter 3.) While the charge asks for priorities, it does not ask for a review of the entire program. In particular, it does not ask us to assess the research program necessary to make ITER and U.S. participation in ITER a success, though it is clear that this is th e top priority of the U.S. program. (A committee of the Burning Plasma Organizati on is actively pursuing this topic.) Other elements of the program are ex cluded by construction, for example inertial confinement and alternate magnetic concepts ar e considered only to the extent that they could influence or facilitate, in a significant way, the direct path from ITER to Demo. We note that the charge anticipated additiona l planning activities th at would cover parts of the program not within the scope of this one . The panel carried out its prioritization in this context and readers should not assume that any comparative judgments have been made between the activities covered in this report and those excluded. The charge does not request a new fusion road map or development plan, Where needed, the panel assumed the program developmen t pace to be given roughly by the FESAC fusion development plan [1.1], modified by th e delays in ITER approval and the start of construction. This ambitious schedule leads to an emphasis on the most developed approaches, mainly involving the tokamak and its advanced and low-aspe ct ratio variants. Stellarator issues were also reviewed, as it is the next most developed concept and operates intrinsically steady-st ate and without disruptions - two critical issues for the tokamak. Other magnetic configurations were discussed in so far as they have potential for contributing to the main-line path, but under the assumptions of the charge, their principle role would be to mitigate technica l risk and provide possible improvements for the next generation of fusion plants. While our attention was concentr ated on more or less conventional approaches, the panel was mindf ul that the program must be open to opportunities for breakthroughs, for example in new concepts, materials or magnets, which have the potential to ch ange the landscape for fusion. The charge was oriented toward \"major\" activities. In addition to possible new facilities, the panel was asked to examine large-scale computational initiatives or other large coherent programs that would be needed to answer critical que stions. The panel restricted its attention to general missions, f acility concepts and approaches and did not review specific machine designs or proposals, neither were budgets ex plicitly considered. 23 1.c. Recent Planning Exercises and Reviews The policy groundwork for the current directio n of the U.S. program was set down in a series of workshops [1.2,1.3], studies and re ports from the NRC[1.4] and FESAC[1.5,1.6] which all stressed the importance of burni ng-plasma research and recommended U.S. participation in ITER. Preparing for ITER operation and carryi ng out its research program will occupy a large part of the U.S. fusion community for several decades. In this context, the major U.S. facilities have been reviewed [1.7] and found to have a solid record of achievement, a strong foundation fo r our involvement in ITER and, given the diminished budgets, a surprising level of le adership in many important areas. A comprehensive assessment of scientific quest ions challenges laid out the technical priorities and identified opportunities for futu re progress [1.8]. Most recently, an NRC decadal study of plasma science heralded a \"new era in magnetic fusion research\", built on the start of ITER, and challenged the fusi on program to begin long-term planning in that circumstance [1.9]. It posed two ques tions for this exercise, the first concerned preparation for the ITER research program and the second asked \"What science and enabling technology must be developed to move beyond ITER to fusion-generated electricity?\". This is precisely the question th at the panel has attempted to address in this report. In our own deliberations, we have been able to build on the solid foundation provided by all of the previous studies noted here. 1.d Discussion of Demo and Characteristics To answer the charge, the panel needed a working definition for Demo and an outline of its characteristics. Given the time span, it was not possible or reasonable to try to predict precisely how Demo would be implemented, thus we chose to use a broad definition to ensure that the program does not foreclose options prematurely. In U.S. planning, Demo is the last step before commercialization of fusion energy. Demo must provide power producers with the confidence to invest in commercial fusion power plants, i.e., demonstrate that fusion is practical, reliab le, economically competitive, and meets public acceptance. In addition, Demo must operate reliably and safely on the power grid for long periods of times ( i.e., years) so that power producers ga in operational experience. (Further details on the U.S. vision for Demo and a comparison with the plans of our ITER partners can be found in s ection 3.e of this report.) The top level goals for the U.S. Demo were summarized in the FESAC fusion development plan [1.1]: Integration and Scalability to a Commercial Power Plant: 1. Use the physics and technology anticip ated for the first generation of commercial power plants as an integrated system 2. Be of sufficient size for confident scalability (>50%-75% of commercial). Reliability 3. Demonstrate robotic or remote maintenance of fusion core. 4. Demonstrate routine operation with minimum number of unscheduled 24shutdowns per year. 5. Ultimately achieve an availability > 50% and extrapolate to commercially desired levels. Safety and Environmental Impact: 6. Not require an evacuation plan. 7. Generate only low-level waste. 8. Not disturb the public's day-to-day activities. 9. Not expose workers to a higher risk than other power plants. 10. Demonstrate a closed tritium fuel cycle. Economics: 11. Demonstrate that the cost of electric ity from a commercial fusion power plant will likely be competitive. The panel noted that this definition of Demo is different than that used by some other fusion programs in the world. In particul ar, the requirement that a U.S. Demo use and demonstrate the same technologies that will be incorporated in a commercial power plant is fundamental for enabling pr ivate investment. If the ba sic technologies are improved following the Demo, they may require demo nstration in a new De mo to reduce risk before incorporation in a commercial plant. The differences between the U.S. and other international fusion programs approach to Demo are discussed in Chapter 3. 1.e Approach Taken By Panel And Organization Of Report The panel began by attempting to identify all th e scientific and technical questions which confront magnetic fusion research. We then consolidated these under three major themes into a tractable set of high-level issues which would serve as the basis set for our prioritization and gap analysis. We recognize d that our particular organization of the issues is not unique, but it was designed esp ecially to be useful for the rest of our activities. Chapter 2 carefully and concrete ly defines each issue, the extrapolations in knowledge that each required and the importa nt couplings between issues. This provided the common understanding for prioriti zation, which was carried out, in the first place, using a well-defined set of criteria a nd scoring system. Further discussion was needed to resolve discrepancies in scoring and to reach consensus. The inventory of \"available means\" was straightforward. Chap ter 3 presents an inventory of \"available means\" to address these issues. It summa rizes the mission, capabilities, schedule and plans for each major facility as well as large computational initiatives, technology programs, and test stands. For further perspe ctive, it surveys the international plans for fusion development. As far as possible we ha ve relied on original sources. Using this background, the anticipated gaps in our knowledge are analyzed in Chapter 4, including a compilation of fine-scale gaps and activities or \"mission-elements\" which could fill the gaps. The gaps were then combined into a smaller set of \"significant\" or major gaps and the mission elements consolidated into a list of possible major initiatives facilities and programs in chapter 5. The relationship between the gaps and initiatives is shown graphically in figure 1. This provides, in effect, a menu from which a set of activities which would fill all gaps could be chosen.. 25References [1.1] FESAC - Fusion Development Path 2003 report from Snowmass http://www.ofes.fusion.doe.gov/More _HTML/FESAC/Austinfinalfull.pdf [1.6] 2001 http://www.ofes.fusion.doe.gov/More _HTML/FESAC/BurningPlasma8-2001.pdf [1.7] FESAC - http://www.ofes.fusion.doe.gov/more _html/FESAC/FacilitiesVolume2_v3.pdf [1.8] \"Scientific Challenges, Opportunities for the U.S. Fusion Energy Science Program\", FESAC Report, 2004 http://www.ofes.fusion.doe.gov/more_html/FESAC/PP_Rpt_Apr05R.pdf [1.9] NRC decadal study of plasma science 2007 [1.10] \"Non-Electric Applications of Fusion, FESAC Report, 2003 http://www.ofes.fusion.doe.gov/More _HTML/FESAC/FESACFinalNon-Elec.pdf 26 27 Chapter 2 Scientific and Technical Questions on the Road Toward Demo 2.a. Themes and Issues Charge 1 requires that we identify the scien tific and technical questions which must be answered before we are ready to proceed to Demo. Together, these questions should define the challenges ahead and set the l ong-term research agenda for the U.S. The panel also recognized a set of overarching issues, which were entwined with most of the others and which, in many cas es, explicitly or implicitly drive research in other areas. These issues describe necessary characterist ics of an overall fusion system and include availability, maintainability, reliability, economics and safe ty. The panel debated about the treatment of these issues an d decided, with the exception of safety, that they were best thought of as aspects of the other issues and that treating them sepa rately would diminish their importance and impact. (It was felt that there were features of the safety and environment issues that were sufficiently se parable which warranted somewhat different treatment.) It was useful to organize the issues into three broad themes, which provided a narrative framework into which specific issues fit and which helped to clarify the relationship between issues. These themes have some commonality with those used by the FESAC priorities panel but are not identical due to different emphases in the charges. The themes were defined in terms of the knowledge that will need to be accumulated prior to Demo and the use to which that knowledge would be put. In the definitions, we emphasize that the knowledge gained must be based on sound sc ientific principles and rigorously tested in the laboratory so that the step to a dem onstration power reactor would be taken with high confidence of success. Theme A. Creating predictable high- performance steady-state plasmas The state of knowledge must be sufficient for the construction, with high confidence, of a device that permits the creation of sustaine d plasmas which meet simultaneously, all the conditions required for practica l production of fusion energy. Theme B. Taming the Plasma Material Interface The state of knowledge must be sufficien t to design and build, with high confidence, robust material components which interface th e hot plasma in the presence of very high neutron fluences. 28 Theme C. Harnessing fusion power The state of knowledge must be sufficien t to design and build, with high confidence, robust and reliable systems which can convert fusion products to useful forms of energy in a reactor environment, including a self-sufficient suppl y of tritium fuel. Identification of the issues began by compila tion of a long list of outstanding questions organized topically. After cons iderable discussion, these were consolidated into a shorter list, at appropriate granularity, which could provide the basis set needed for prioritization and gap analysis. This decomposition and organi zation of issues is clearly not unique, but was designed to aid in answering subsequent parts of the charge. Concrete definitions and detailed descriptions were written for each issue. This was cruc ial, since the precise boundaries between related issu es has a marked impact on the assessment of priorities. Extrapolations from the current state of knowledge and device performance to the level required for Demo were also identified. Th e detailed descriptions are included in section 2.b. below. The issues, sorted under their thematic headings are: Theme A. Creating predictable high- performance steady-state plasmas 1. Measurement: Make advances in sensor hardw are, procedures and algorithms for measurements of all necessary plas ma quantities with su fficient coverage and accuracy needed for the scientific mi ssion, especially plasma control. 2. Integration of high-performan ce, steady-state, burning plasmas: Create and conduct research, on a routine basis, of high performance core, edge and SOL plasmas in steady-state with the combin ed performance characteristics required for Demo. 3. Validated Theory and Predictive Modeling: Through developments in theory and modeling and careful comparison with experiments, develop a set of computational models which are capable of predicting all important plasma behavior in the regimes and geometries relevant for practical fusion energy. 4. Control: Investigate and establish schemes for maintaining high-performance, burning plasmas at a desired, multiva riate operating point with a specified accuracy for long periods without disruption or other major excursions. (Provision for sensors is included under issue 1 and for actuators under issue 6.) 5. Off-normal Plasma Events: Understand the underlying physics and control of high-performance magnetically confined plasmas sufficiently so that 'off-normal' plasma operation, which could cause catastr ophic failure of internal components, can be avoided with high reliability and/or develop approaches that allow the devices tolerate some number or frequency of these events. (Because of their implications and importance, these 'off normal events' are called out separately from the control issues listed above). 296. Plasma Modification by Auxiliary Systems: Establish the physics and engineering science of auxiliary syst ems which can provide power, particles, current and rotation at the appropriate locati ons in the plasma at the appropriate intensity. 7. Magnets: Understand the engineering and materials science needed to provide economic, robust, reliable, maintainable magnets for plasma confinement, stability and control. B. Taming the plasma material interface 8. Plasma-Wall Interactions: Understand and control of all processes which couple the plasma and nearby materials. 9. Plasma Facing Components: Understand the materials and processes that can be used to design replaceable component s which can survive the enormous heat, plasma and neutron fluxes without degradi ng the performance of the plasma or compromising the fuel cycle. 10. RF Antennas, Launching Structur es and Other Internal Components: Establish the necessary understanding of plasma interactions, neutron loading and materials to allow design of RF antennas and launchers, control coils, final optics and any other diagnostic equipment which can survive and function within the plasma vessel. C. Harnessing fusion power 11. Fusion Fuel Cycle: Learn and test how to manage the flow of tritium throughout the entire plant, in cluding breeding and recovery. 12. Power Extraction: Understand how to extract fusion power at temperatures sufficiently high for efficient produc tion of electricity or hydrogen. 13. Materials Science in the Fusion Environment: Understand the basic materials science for fusion breeding blankets, st ructural components, plasma diagnostics and heating components in high neutron fluence areas. 14. Safety: Demonstrate the safety and enviro nmental potential of fusion power: to preclude the technical need for a public evacuation plan, and to minimize the environmental burdens of radioactive waste, mixed waste, or chemically toxic waste for future generations. 15. Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Inspectability: Demonstrate the productive capacity of fusion power and validate economic assumptions about plant operations by rivaling other electr ical energy production technologies. 302.b. Detailed Discussion of the Issues 2.b.1. Measurement: Make advances in sensor hardware , procedures and algorithms for measurements of all necessary plasma quantities with sufficient coverage and accuracy needed for the scientific mission, especially plasma control. Measurement capability is essential to the development of plasma science and fusion power. Progress toward the development of predictive physical mo dels and validated computer simulations is paced by deploymen t of innovative plasma diagnostics. The ability to measure quantities that characte rize the plasma-material interface is also required to help specify materi al properties able to withsta nd a fusion environment. The long term control and stability of fusion plasmas depends on robust diagnostics that provide a continuous stream of reliable and detailed information. Although measurement capability is mature for existing experimental facilities, significant gaps remain in the coverage of desired measurements and in the development of measurement capability within a nuclear burning plasma environmen t. Four sub-issues describing measurement capability are described below. a. Diagnostic Capability (adequacy of measurements for achieving predictive understanding and plasma control) The understanding of fusion plasmas is adva ncing rapidly, building on improvements in theory, applied math and powerful codes, comb ined with the development of diagnostics able to measure a wide range of plasma quantities. A significant portion of effort and funding, at every magnetic confinement facility, is devoted to the development and deployment of diagnostics. Some measurements remain extremely difficult and relatively rare, yet vital to the development of predicti ve fusion science. Perhaps most notable in this category are detailed measurements of plasma fluctuations in the frequency and wavelength range important fo r turbulent transport. The science of plasma control has also a dvanced greatly. Many of the high performance configurations that would maximize the attr activeness of a fusion power source have stringent requirements on quantities such as the plasma shape and profiles for the plasma pressure and current. Controlling such plasma s in steady-state, including avoidance and mitigation of off-normal transients, is increasing important. The quantities that need to be measured are mostly known, and future development needs focus more on providing a robust, high quality data stream to interface w ith actuators that directly influence plasma quantities. Extrapolation: A reasonable understanding of the desired measurements is already in hand. The existing and planned low-neutron facilities are or will be substantially diagnosed. Measurements that directly iden tify turbulent transport mechanisms are notably rare and challeng ing; most measure density fluctuations only while measurements of other fluctuating fields, su ch ion or electron temperature and potential would be invaluable in making comparison with theory. Many established diagnostic techniques will not work in a burning plasma (nuclear) environment. Hence substantial 31development of diagnostics suitable for a De mo environment must ensue, as described below. b. Diagnostic compatibility in nuclear environment Many of the diagnostics presentl y employed will be unavailable or much more difficult in Demo. These issues are already exposed in the diagnostics planned for ITER. For example, ITER (and Demo) will not have neutral beams that penetrate deeply into the plasma. Measurements that are enabled by beam-plasma interactions will therefore be limited or unavailable. If new techniques ar e not developed to provide equivalent measurements, the advanced tokamak program on ITER could be seriously hampered by lack of vital pressure and cu rrent profile information. This could limit the ability to control the plasma in advanced, high performance modes of operation. These issues are accentuated in Demo. Generally it is believed there will be less access to the plasma, while at the same time control of profiles, monitoring of material erosion, accounting for tritium inventory, etc. will be e ssential. The neutron fl uence in Demo will be several-fold larger than in ITER, restricting material choices for nearby diagnostics components. Like many other components, diagnostics will need to be remotely maintainable. The robustness of the measurements will need to be gr eater than presently achieved in order to maintain plasma control over long periods of time. Extrapolation: Many existing diagnostic tech niques are not compatible with an intense nuclear environment. The neutron fluence will be much larger in Demo than ITER. The ITER diagnostic set is currently not adequa te for the plasma control envisioned in advanced tokamak regimes. New diagnostics will be required for the plasma-boundary interface, and for monitoring tritium inventory. c. In situ, long term calibration and testing The continuous operation of Demo demands a degree of measurement robustness that has not been required to date. Not only does the data n eed to be continually reliable, but a gradual change in the instrume ntation physical characteristic s from neutron and radiation damage must be accounted for. At the same time, the near steady-state operation of the device will limit access to diagnostic hardware and its ability to operate during diagnostic maintenance. Extrapolation: There is limited experience in this area (it has not been a major issue so far). Accounting for continual damage an d degradation of optical and electrical components will be essential. New calibration an d testing approaches will be needed that do not rely on substantial \"off-line\" access, bot h in the amount of time available and in hands-on accessibility (remote maintenance required). d. Interpretation and analysis 32Many plasma diagnostics are easy to interpre t, while others required sophisticated analysis to glean important measurement information. The fusion community includes many experts in data analysis. Looking to the future, the main challenge will be providing this information in real-time with high reliabi lity. This may be more a technical issue as opposed to a conceptual issue. Coupling measurements more closely to vali dated predictive fusion science might enable a reduction in diagnostic coverage and analysis requirements. This is important given the likelihood for reduced diagnostic access in Demo. Extrapolation: There is a great deal of established experience and expertise for data interpretation and analysis in the fusion program. Future requirements will stress steady-state, real-time analysis for control with an extremely high degree of reliability. There may be a need for more sophisticated mode ling as a part of measurement analysis, particularly if diagnostic access is more limited in ITER and Demo. Associated coupling and integration issues: - measurement requirements for validation of predictive fusion science - measurement requirements for robust, l ong-term plasma control, including off- normal transients - monitoring the plasma boundary in terface, including materials - compatibility with remote handling and maintenance - requirements for safe operation of a fusion reactor 2.b.2. Integration of high-performance, steady-state, burning plasmas: Create and conduct research, on a routine basis, of hi gh performance core, edge and SOL plasmas in steady-state with the combined perf ormance characteristics required for Demo. An essential challenge for Demo is to successfully manage the complex integration of all the fundamental physics elements of fusion so that a stable, steadily burning plasma state is achieved. The burning plasma core is repl ete with complex intern al feedback loops and non-linear couplings. The dominant (>80%) internal source of heat in the plasma will be from alpha particles produced in the fusi on reactions, and the magnitude and spatial distribution of that heat s ource will depend on the magnitude and spatial distribution of the plasma pressure. But the pressure distri bution itself is determined by the dominant alpha particle heat source a nd external sources of heat and particles and the spatial profiles of the plasma transpor t. The plasma transport is determined largely by plasma turbulence which is in turn determined by th e gradients of the plasma temperature and density, and is also profoundly affected by the spatial distributio ns of magnetic and electric fields. The energetic alpha particles may promote or deteriorate the stability of the plasma, perhaps causing loss of the alpha particles and thei r vital heating effect. An efficient Demo plasma needs to operate at high pressures to en sure adequate fusion power, and to sustain this power level at very high availabili ty and preferably steady-state for attractive economics. In addition, this complex burning plasma core must be coupled to the edge and SOL plasma to exhaust plas ma energy and particles at manageable power 33 Fig. 2.b.2 Lawson Diagram for Magnetic Fusion densities under steady-state conditions while maintaining efficient confinement and sustainment of the plasma core. The integration of high performance, steady- state burning plasmas can be divided into four elements; a. High performance burning plasma core, b. Edge and scrape-off plasmas, and c. Sustainment of magnetic configuration and plasma. d. Optimization of the plasma configuration a. High Performance Burning Plasma Core Fusion Gain - A fusion power plant plasma, and hence Demo, will require a fusion power gain (Q = P fusion/Pext-heat ) in the range of Q = 25 - 50 to provide net electricity at competitive prices. [2.b.2.1, 2.b.2.2]. At th ese fusion gains, the plasma is 83 -91% self- heated. The physical requirements for the achievement of high gain, developed by Lawson [2.b.2.3] in 1957 are summarized for a typical magnetically confined plasma in the Lawson Diagram [Fig 2.b.2]. High fu sion gain in a 50/50 DT plasma requires a fusion fuel density (n e) times energy confinement time ( E) product of 6x1020 m-3s at a fuel temperature in the 10-20 keV range. Th e primary challenge has been to obtain the required temperature, density and confinement simultaneously in an integrated manner. 34Plasma Confinement - A crucial issue in designing a de vice to attain high fusion gain is the uncertainty in predicting plasma energy and particle confinement. In the past, the primary method of predicting confinement was to use empirical scaling relations determined from extensive data bases of e xperimental results from many experiments. A significant effort has been underway to deve lop more accurate physics based models of plasma energy and particle transport, and to then test these models under conditions relevant to Demo plasmas. Extrapolati on of plasma confinement should be more straightforward from plasmas wh ose dimensionless parameters ( cE = /Te, V rot/VAlfv\u00e9n, a/R, , q ) are similar to those expected in a Demo plasma. The overall similarity parameter, BR5/4 , of ITER and Demo are approximately the same, so ITER will have the capability to access pl asma physics regimes very close to those of a Demo plasma. Fusion Power Density - In addition to high fusion gain, the burning plasma core must produce a sufficient fusion power density to achieve economic attractiveness. For D-T plasma temperatures in the range of 10-20 keV, fusion power density is proportional to p 2, where p is the plasma pressure. For tokamaks, the plasma pressure is constrained by MHD stability limits, = <p>/B 02 < limit = I/aB 0 where B 0 is the magnetic field in the center of the plasma chamber. MHD stability limits can be increased by the use of conducting walls surrounding the plasma or by feedback stabiliza tion of modes. Typically, N < 3 can be achieved without conducti ng walls, full exploita tion of advanced tokamak modes with N ~5 will require feedback stabilizat ion. The magnetic field in the plasma is limited by stresses and current de nsity limits produced by the magnetic fields (Bc) at the coil, and by the geometric confi guration of the magnetic coil. The maximum fusion power density is therefore p2 ~ [N(I/aB 0)]2 (B 0/Bcoil)4 Bcoil4 In a Demo design, the required fusion power density can be obt ained by a tradeoff between the physics challenges of high , the engineering challenges of high B coil, and optimization of the coil geometry, (B 0/Bcoil). Consequences of Plasma Instab ility and Magnetic Asymmetries (see section 2.b.5) - When the operational stability limits are violat ed large scale instabilities can occur with a range of consequences. Most of these inst abilities serve to reduce plasma confinement thereby degrading the fusion power output. Howe ver, the most virulent instabilities such as the major disruption, can produce significan t transient heat load s and electromagnetic loads on internal components. While exis ting devices have de veloped designs and operational techniques to mitigate and survive the effects of disruptions, the consequences will increase for ITER and Demo. The presence of large repetitive edge localized modes (ELMs) can also cause ex tensive melting and erosion of divertor components. Metrics include: W th, dur, Ihalo, scaling of thermal and EM loads with size, and disruption frequency) The loss of a small fraction of the energetic alpha population due to instabilities or magnetic field asymmetries can produce severe localized heat loads and the possibility of localized damage to internal components. Th is has been observed in present experiments and techniques have been developed to eliminate the source and mitigate the effects. The losses due to field asymmetries are relatively well understood and can be predicted if the 35field asymmetries are known. A new issue wi ll be the magnetic asymmetries introduced by the ferromagnetic materials being proposed fo r the first wall and breeding blankets in a Demo or power plant. This issue will be addressed using non-burning plasmas in JT- 60SA and by test ITER. Metric: allowed P loss (MW, MWm-2, % of P) b. Edge and Scrape-off Plasmas The edge and scrape-off plasma provi des the interface between the high temperature of the fusion plasma core and material walls of the vacuum chamber while exhausting the plasma energy and particles (esp ecially alpha ash) at high power densities under steady-state conditions. The plasma edge is required to provide a high temperature (~4 keV) boundary condition for the plasma core that allows the plasma core to maintain adequate plasma confinement and low plasma densities to increase core current drive efficiency. The outer edge of the plasma scrape-off interacts with the first wall and divertor material and is desire d to have higher density to he lp reduce the temperature to ~ 20eV to reduce material erosion to allowable levels. Materials erosion and re-deposition must also be compatible with low tritium retention. The edge plasma has the additional complications of: significant plasma flows, increased levels of impurities, alpha ash and neutrals, significant radiation losses and complicated geometry. In addition, Edge Localized Modes (ELMS) periodically collapse the edge transport barrier injecting large fluxes of energy into the scrape-off plasma. The parameters of interest in understanding the edge plasma include: T, n e, v//, Zeff, q//, Ploss/Adiv (MWm-2). c. Sustainment of the Magnetic Configuration and Burning Plasma. Studies of magnetic fusion power plants in dicate the need to operate with high availability over periods of ~ 1 year. Stea dy-state operation is highly desirable with an approximately factor of two reduction in es timated cost of electricity for steady-state operation relative to pulsed operation (as in an inductively driven tokamak). The goal is to have the capability of c ontinuous operation for periods of 1 year. Magnetic Configuration Sustainment - Tokamak : The magnetic configuration of a tokamak relies on a large toroidal plasma current which is sustained by an inductive electric field for durations of minutes in present experiments. The toroidal current can also be driven for longer peri ods of time by the injection of radio frequency (RF) waves or neutral beams (NB). The physics of RF and NB current driv e is relatively well understood, and has been verified in several experiments. Tokamak plasmas have been sustained for > 5 hours using RF waves. In addition, a substantial fraction (~80%) of the toroidal current can be produced by pressu re gradients within the plasma by the \"bootstrap\" current effect which has been demonstrated for short durations on existing experiments. A range of continuous operati on power plant designs have been analyzed with bootstrap fractions ranging from 60% to 90% with the remainder driven by RF waves and NB. The economic benefit rises over this range. The major issues are the cost required to construct and ope rate a reactor-relevant current drive system, and the robustness of high gain burning plasmas to provi de a large fraction of the plasma current 36in the presence of the strong coupling among alpha heating defined plasma pressure profiles, MHD stability and plasma transport. Magnetic Configuration Sustainment - Stellarator : The magnetic configuration of a stellarator is inherently steady-state and is produced primarily by three dimensional magnetic coils, with internal \"bootstrap- like\" plasma current s providing additional magnetic transform. Generally, stellarators do not suffer from disruptions and ELMS are not observed at high- . Stellarators optimized for low plasma currents such as W-7X lead to very large fusion power plants [2.b.2 .4]. Recent theoretical studies indicate that \"quasi-symmetric\" stellarator (QAS) confi gurations [2.b.2.5] exist with desirable properties. A QAS design can be optimized for equilibrium, MHD stability, energetic particle confinement, etc. at a lower aspect ratio R/a min than the standard stellarator with an increased bootstrap plasma current that pr oduces up ~25% of the transform. Such a configuration has been analyzed in the Ar ies-CS study potentially produce an attractive reactor. The higher density limit in stella rators is advantageous for reducing alpha- particle driven instabilities and reducing edge temperatures for interfacing with the PFCs. The issues for the stellarator are general validation of the QA S principle, closure of flux surfaces, energetic particle confinement in non-symmetric geometry, uncertain limits, power and particle removal in 3-D geometry and the complexity and cost of the three dimensional structure. Experiments are requir ed to confirm that these issues can be resolved simultaneously, and to develop the un derstanding of how to optimize future 3D configuration designs. Plasma Sustainmen t: The fuel mix in a burning plasma must be sustained by continual refueling of the plasma core through a combina tion of external fuel injection (e.g., gas or pellet injection) penetrating past the plasma SOL followed by internal processes that transport fuel into the central core region. While fuel is being transported inward, alpha ash must be removed from the fusion core a nd impurities originati ng from the PFCs must be prevented from migrating to the plasma core. Finally, the SOL must transport alpha ash, impurities and spent DT fuel into the divertor pumping system for separation and re- injection of the DT fuel. Key parameters for the fueling, ash rem oval and impurity control processes are line density (na), plasma temperature and profile sh apes. Particle transport processes are not well understood on existing tokamaks, but sati sfactory techniques have been developed that are effective on plasmas with large na such as JET and C-Mod. ITER will provide a major test and demonstration of particle co ntrol techniques since it is the roughly the same line density and temperature as a Demo plasma. Plasma Facing Component Sustainment : The plasma facing components must be have erosion lifetimes compatible with continuous operation at high power density in an intense neutron irradiation environmen t for up to one year. (Section 2.b.9) d. Optimization of the plasma configuration for Demo The default choice for the first Demo has not changed significantly ove r the past 20 years, 37and is based on a tokamak with a standard aspect ratio an d modest advanced capability (N= 3-4, f bs =60-70%. Over the next decade, improved understanding of the physics phenomena and engineering capab ilities gained from physical experiments and ever improving computer simulations will determine how much this default choice may be modified for the initiation of Demo design activities. A key on-going activity will be systems studies aimed at identifying the high leverage technical areas and characteristics of interest to the eventual customer. Strongly Self-Heated Plasma Coupling Issues: The degree to which a strongly self-heated plasma creates a robust operati ng range with the desired pr operties is an over arching issue for magnetic fusion. The strong self-h eating removes our ability to control the plasma with external sources, and allows the inte rnal couplings to define the plasma state. The associated coupling and integration issues are: High performance with sustained/sustainable configurations o Self-consistent, self-heating at high Q, pressure profile o Self-generated current consistent with self-heating o Burn control (thermal stability) o Control with Demo relevant measurements o Ultra-Low disruptivity High-performance sustained core plasma with FW/Divertor o Fueling, impurity control and as h removal consistent with high- performance sustained core o Edge densities and temperatures consistent with efficient current drive and reliable divertor operation o Heating and current drive systems consistent with core and edge conditions required for Demo o Sustainable transient heat loads- ELMs, disruptions, etc at high performance.

Validated Theory and Predictive Modeling: Through developments in theory and modeling and careful comparison with exper iments, develop a set of computational models which are capable of predicting all im portant plasma behavior in the regimes and geometries relevant for practical fusion energy. The ITER design is based primarily on extrapol ation from existing experiments. Some of these extrapolations are not large and are well-guided by theoretical ideas. In many 38important cases, however, the extrapolations are large and no clearly validated and widely accepted theoretical ideas exist to info rm mission-critical design decisions. In the face of this uncertainty, the cost of the ITER project is higher than it otherwise would have been, and its success cannot be assumed to follow without further significant investment. Even assuming success in mee ting specific operational targets over the lifetime of the experiment, significant extrapolations from ITER to DEMO will remain. How will the DEMO plasma behave? What ar e the critical design elements that will allow the DEMO operators to get the plasma performance required for safe, reliable operation? Without validated, predictive models of plasma behavior, these questions will not be answerable, and the cost and risks of DEMO will be higher than necessary. Successful operation of the ITER burning pl asma experiment depends on continuing to improve our understanding and predictive capabili ty. However, further progress in four critical areas (turbulence/transport, magnetohydrodynamic physics, boundary physics and wave-particle interactions) will not be possi ble with a significant expansion of plasma diagnostic capabilities. We cannot understand what we cannot measure. The nuclear and high heat flux environments of ITER (a nd more so, DEMO) mean that diagnostic information will be especially expensive. We will be forced to measure less of the fantastically large range of spatio-temporal processes that comprise \"plasma behavior\", not more. It is vitally im portant, therefore, that we de velop clearer ideas about what must be measured and understood in ITER to design DEMO. In light of tremendous strides in theoretical modeling that have been taken over the last decade or so, the least expensive and highest value investment that can be made today to address DEMO plasma performance issues is in the area of valid ating emerging theoretical models of all important aspects of plasma behavior. Model validation is the process through which the scientific community comes to accept that a particular model reliably predicts importa nt aspects of plasma behavior. Hence, the development of validated predictive models will require active coll aboration between the experimental, theoretical and computational communities. This effort will be the major mission of the \"base program\" through the completion of ITER operations as new experimental data leads to the refinement (or even abandonment) of theoretical models. New or refined theoretical models generally must be implemented in large computer codes if they are to capture the complexity of actual experiments. Testing the predictions of these models against experiments will requi re new diagnostics and will generally lead to further refinements in the underlying mode l and/or the numerical implementation. This iterative process is at the heart of the sc ientific method. Important aspects of plasma behavior which must be mastered include: Turbulence and Transport. Achieving high fusion gain requires minimizing the transport of energy across magnetic surfaces; while achieving steady-state in a high-performance plasma requires control of the density (par ticularly the impurity density) and rotation profiles. It is generally accepted within the magnetic fusion community that, in the vast majority of experimental discharges, the dominant cause of the transport of particles, momentum, and energy across magnetic surfaces is plasma microturbulence \u2014 small fluctuations in the plasma electric and magnetic fields which result from the growth and 39saturation of waves driven unstable by the e xpansion free-energy of the plasma. Plasma micro-turbulence differs from macroscopic, or MHD turbulence in that it saturates at a low level. The growth and saturation of plasma microturbulence generally depends on the velocity distribution of the various plasma species (electrons, deuterium, tritium, etc.). This turbulence can be described by a combin ation of the gyrokinetic equation [Antonsen, 1980; Frieman, 1982], to describe the state of the plasma velocity distribution(s), and Maxwell's equations, to describe the self-c onsistent electric and magnetic fields. Computer codes implementing the gyrokinetic/Maxwell model have been developed. These codes can be run on the current ge neration of supercomputers modeling time intervals which include many turbulence corr elation times, thereby enabling detailed studies of plasma microturbulence as it ex ists in the computational models, and the validation of the gyrokinetic/Maxwewll m odel through comparisons between detailed code predictions and experiment. This va lidation effort will re quire investment in experimental diagnostics to measure microtur bulent fluctuations, experimental time on major tokamaks to make measurements over a wide range of plasma parameters, and continued development and maintenance of computer codes implementing the gyrokinetic/Maxwell system. Turbulence correlation times ar e typically of the order of 100 \u00b5s and these simulations, which may take weeks on modern supercom puters, model only a few milliseconds of a tokamak discharge. Confinement times (the ti me for the profiles of temperature, rotation, and density to change significantly) on IT ER are expected to be several seconds (requiring simulations with a duration that is a thousand times longer) while the ITER discharge is expected to last 1000's of seconds (requiring simu lations with a duration that a million times longer). These daunting computational requirements have motivated the development of reduced models for tracking the evolution of toka mak discharges over macroscopic time intervals. It is currently a matter of controversy whether such reduced models have retained e nough of the physics governing pl asma microturbulence to provide a reliable basis for predicting the tran sport of energy, momentum and particles in ITER and DEMO discharges. Generating a scie ntific consensus that such a reduce model will provide a reliable extrapolation from ITER to DEMO will require extensive collaborative effort on the part of expe rimental, theoretical and modeling groups. Plasma Edge Turbulence The plasma edge includes open magnetic field lines, where the plasma impinges on material surfaces, together with an annulus of closed field lines enclosing the core plasma. Radial gradient s in the in the temperature, rotation, and density are generally much larger in the plasma edge than in the plasma core. The transport of thermal energy across this region is important to the overall performance (and fusion gain) of the discharge; the flux of particles and energy from open field lines onto material surfaces is critical to the de sign of plasma facing components; and an important class of off-normal events, ELMs, originate in the plasma edge. A low frequency model like gyrokinetics is expected to describe fluc tuations in the edge plasma. However, the steeper gradients can lead to substantially higher levels of turbulent fluctuations which challenge the gyrokinetic ordering; th e presence of both open and 40closed magnetic surfaces complicates the geometry; and neutrals generated by the recycling of plasma on material surfaces can provide important sources of particles and sinks for momentum and energy that are not in cluded in current gyrokinetic codes. These complications are being addressed in a new generation of computer codes, currently under development, which are aimed at modeling plasma edge turbulence. Substantial investment will be required to complete the development of these codes and to validate them. MHD. Magnetically confined plasmas are subj ect to spontaneous deformation. In extreme cases this results in the loss of conf inement. The stability of the plasma against such deformations is described by magnet ohydrodynamics (MHD). MHD is important DEMO because the configurational instabil ities described by MHD theory limit the plasma pressure and, hence, the fusion power density (which is propor tional to the square of the plasma pressure). In addition, off- normal events, including disruptions and ELMs are described by MHD theory. Computer codes implementing ideal MHD th eory are well developed and accurately describe the onset and linear gr owth of configurational inst abilities. Studies of the saturation and nonlinear consequences of such in stabilities require the inclusion of finite plasma resistivity, viscosity, and other diss ipative (non-ideal) effects. The plasma's motion is affected by the presence of conducti ng walls near the plasma. Computer codes have been developed which implement non-ideal MHD models. These codes have had success in modeling important plasma phenomena such as the \"sawtooth crash\", plasma disruptions and ELMs. Further work is requ ired to extend MHD theory to the long mean- free-path limit appropriate to fusion plasmas, including long mean free path and finite Larmor radius effects in computer codes that can also describe conventional MHD physics, and validating these models against experiment. Substantial opportunities exist to increase the plasma pressure limit using active feedback coils located outside the plasma, and this remains an active area of resear ch. It is not current ly clear which plasma properties should and can be measured in I TER and especially DEMO to provide the \"sensors\" for these feedback coils. RF Wave Propagation and absorption. Radio frequency (RF) waves are used to heat plasmas to temperatures conducive to thermonuclear reactions (~108 \u00b0C) and to drive toroidal current and deposit momentum within the plasma. RF waves are envisioned as an important actuator for systems designed to control the operating point (particularly temperature, pressure, current, and rotation prof iles) in burning plasmas. The theory of RF wave propagation within plasmas is well developed. However, large computer codes are required for the implementation of this theory to accurately address the geometric complexity of tokamaks, and the even greater geometric complexity of stellarators. In addition, the absorption of RF waves often results in substa ntial modification of to the plasma distribution function which, in turn can substantially modify the absorption of the RF waves. Computer codes which address th ese have been developed and efforts to validate them against tokamak experiments ha ve begun. A continuing effort on RF code development and validation will be required to address novel issues associated with 41burning plasmas, such as the presence of energetic alpha particles (produced by DT fusion reactions), which can substantially modi fy RF wave absorption. Accurate models of the propagation of RF waves from the ante nna through the edge plas ma are required to reliably predict the antenna loading, that is the voltage required to launch a specified RF power into the plasma. Accurate estimates of antenna loading is critical to antenna design and remains an area of active resear ch. Although open issues remain, RF wave propagation is a relatively mature field, and efforts have begun to couple RF modules into more comprehensive models of tokamak plasmas, investigating (for example) the effects of RF waves on MHD stability. 2.b.4. Control: Investigate and establish schemes for maintaining a high-performance, burning plasmas at a desired, multivariate ope rating point with a specified accuracy for long periods without disruption or other major excursions. (Provision for sensors is included under issue 1 and fo r actuators under issue 6.) Plasma control by definition is crucial to cont rolled thermonuclear fusion. In particular, a magnetically confined burning plasma must be maintained for long periods - on the order of months. In control parlance, control ac tions are provided by actuators with the magnitude of the actuator response determined by sensors. The precise requirements for these actuators and sensors are described in sections 2.b.6 and 2.b.1 , respectively. For a burning plasma control loops will be required for the following areas. a. Plasma shape control Plasma shape control is achieved by varying the currents in the poloidal field coils. Usually the plasma location is determined by magnetic diagnostics, although optical detection means have also been used succes sfully. The plasma boundary is well described by the ideal MHD equilibrium equation. There has been a long history of successful plasma shape control on a myriad of different experiments. b. Vertical position control Although this topic is really a subset of shape control, it is usually treated separately because tokamaks, with highly elongated cross- sections, are unstable to vertical motion. The physics of this instability is well understood, and there is a large body of work aimed at developing sophisticated c ontrollers in a tokamak. Remain ing uncertainties arise from the difficulty in predicting the precise evol ution of global parameters, such as the peakedness of the plasma current profile, that determine the growth rate of this mode. c. Current magnitude and profile control Potential current drive actuators include neut ral beam current drive, lower hybrid current drive, and electron cyclotron current drive with the bulk of the plasma current coming from the pressure driven currents. The pl asma current profile can be measured by 42motional stark effect polarimetr y, using neutral beams, or Fa raday rotation. It is worth noting that the base plan of ITER does not address this issue. d. Plasma heating control Plasma heating comes primarily from fusi on generated alpha particles in a burning plasma, so the primary method of heating control will come from burn control. However a small additional plasma heating system could be used to help control the plasma pressure. ITER will address many of the plasma heating control issues, including burn control. e. Plasma fueling control and helium ash removal The control of plasma fueling is an unsolved issue for Demo. Actuators for effective core fueling in plasma larger than ITER do not exist. If actuators could be developed, the principles of fueling control ar e straightforward, and measurem ents that scale to a larger device are available. It should be noted th at the primary method for burn control in a burning plasma is fueling control. Therefore the issue of fueling control is crucial to ITER. The issue of plasma helium ash remova l is one that ITER will address and will likely extrapolate to Demo. f. Divertor material temperature control Control of the temperature in the divertor of Demo is an extremely challenging topic for which there is no clear solution. Effective strategies for controlling the power flux in the plasma divertor area need to be developed prior to Demo. Demo will have a much higher divertor heat load than ITER, so ITER cannot adequately ad dress this issue. g. Disruption avoidance and mitigation Frequent disruptions can not be tolerated in a Demo. The control of disruptions has not been achieved, and ITER will not be able to demonstrate the steady state avoidance of disruptions, due to its relatively short pulse length. Disruption mitigation is a field in its infancy, and it is not clear that any of the id eas currently being invest igated scale to ITER, or to Demo. In addition, to date no reliable r eal time predictor of plasma disruptions has been demonstrated on an existing device. This is an important research activity for ITER and the accompanying tokamak program. h. Stability control The topic of stability control includes the c ontrol of various instabilities such as ELMs, NTMs and RWMs. Each of these instabili ties requires an indepe ndent controller and actuator loop. It is unclear to what exte nt ITER will address ELM and RWM control, although there is a high probability that ITER will address NTM control. 43i. Integrated control The concept of integrated control implies de veloping a successful control strategy that encompasses all of the above control concep ts along with the control of the understood aspects of plasma control (e.g. shape control, vertical stability control). It seems likely that if actuators and sensors for the unsolved control problems can be identified that a integration strategy could be created. However this has yet to be done. 2.b.5. Off-normal Events: Understand the underlying physi cs and control of high- performance magnetically confined plasmas sufficiently so that 'off-normal' plasma operation, which could cause catastrophic fa ilure of internal components, can be avoided with high reliability and/or develop approaches that allow the devices tolerate some number or frequency of these events. (Because of their implications and importance, these 'off normal events' are call ed out separately from the control issues listed above). Some undesirable events or modes affecting plasma confinement can seriously damage plasma-facing components (PFCs) and other structures. These \"off-normal\" plasma events include disruptions, run-away electr ons, large edge localized modes (ELMS), and possibly bursts of energetic alphas ejected by processes involving energetic particle modes (EPMs) or Alfven eigenmodes (AEs). The state of understand ing of these events and their implications for ITER are describe d in Progress in the ITER Physics Basis, a special issue in Nuclear Fusion [2.b.5.1]. For this discussion, the term \"off-normal\" w ill refer to deviations from normal plasma operation that have proved challenging fo r the ITER design, and may not have design solutions for the higher-performance requirements of a Demo. The PFCs for Demo must face more intense plasma and radiation environments, must have higher reliability and longevity, must allow self-sufficient tritium breeding, and must be consistent with higher coolant temperatures needed for efficient energy conversion to electricity. These requirements lead to designs that make them less able to withstand even the off-normal events expected in ITER. Unless radically new materials or designs for PFCs are discovered, the only solu tions to this issue are to find methods to avoid or mitigate all off-normal plasma even ts in Demo, or to make such events exceedingly rare. a. Possible Approaches Avoiding or mitigating off-normal plasma events in tokamaks is very challenging, particularly in the AT perf ormance regime (high Q, high beta, high bootstrap fraction, steady state) anticipated for Demo. The issue appears to have only two possible plasma-based solutions: 441. Discover and develop improved techniques to predict and either avoid or mitigate off-normal events in an AT-regime tokamak with a high degree of confidence. A successful Demo design must provide for recovery from damage caused by low-probability off-normal events within the availability, safety, and environmental constraints of an economica lly attractive electric power source. 2. Improve the understanding and performance of other confinement configurations that either avoid off-normal events or allow more confidence in their control. A successful non-t okamak Demo design must be based on demonstrated capability of steady-stat e, high-beta confinement and other properties consistent with providing the Q, availability (including recovery from any off-normal event), safety, and environmental features of an economically attractive electric power source. The stellarator is the most advanced configuration that has the potenti al to meet these requirements. b. Status and Extrapolation of Approach 1: AT-Regime Tokamak The implications of the present understanding of four types of off-normal plasma events are summarized in this section. The focus will be on the most troubling aspects of these events, including the implications for ITER and the additional challenges for an AT- based Demo. Disruptions Research has focused on understanding various causes of disruptions and on many techniques for predicting, avoiding, and m itigating them [2.b.5.2]. The well-known operational limits on plasma current, electron density, and beta provide some guidance for reducing disruptions, but exceptions fr equently occur that are not understood. Improved modeling and real-time analysis of diagnostic signals, including the use of neural networks have improve d the ability to predict disruptions. For some types of disruptions the success rate on JT-60U was as high as 98%. However, the success rate for beta-limit disruptions is mu ch lower. Reliable precursors have not been found for this type [2.b.5.3]. The lack of useful precursors poses a significant challenge for ITER exploring high-beta regimes, and is pa rticularly troubling for an AT Demo. Disruptions are considered inevitable in ITER as it will be used to explore a variety of operating modes. For this r eason its PFCs are designed with extra armor that would not be allowed in Demo because of thermal transfer and breeding concerns. Nevertheless, disruptions are expected to shorten the useful lifetime of these components [2.b.5.4]. To minimize the impact of disruptions on ITER, strategies for predic ting, avoiding, and mitigating them will continue to be studied on a variety of existing f acilities, planned new large tokamaks, and on ITER. Avoidance a nd mitigation schemes include: avoiding the three limits mentioned above, soft-stop techni ques, tearing mode stabilization by ECRH injection, vertical position control, and ma ssive injection of impurities (killer pellet injection, massive gas injection, cooled liquid jets, etc.). However, these schemes do not help with high-beta disruptions that do not exhibit useful precursors. 45 Extrapolation. An AT-type Demo will requir e the discovery high-beta, steady-state (high-bootstrap-fraction) regime that is ei ther disruption free, or exhibits useful precursors. If precursors are discovered, the diagnostics for reliably detecting them must endure the nuclear fusion environment of Demo. The actuators for avoiding or mitigating the disruptions must also function in that high-Q plasma environment and must ensure that unmitigated disruptions are exceedingly rare. Moreover, the frequency and duration of mitigation events must be small enough so that cyclic fatigue does not unduly shorten the lifetime of PFCs and other components, and so that availability remains adequately high. These requirements for Demo exceed those needed for ITER, and meeting them will necessitate major advances in understanding and demonstrated performance. Runaway Electrons The most likely cause for major runaway elect ron events is current conversion that can occur either during disruptions or during controlled fast-shu tdowns (soft-stops) used to avoid disruptions. This close connection be tween runaways and disruptions motivates coupled research efforts. Conve rsion efficiencies of up to 70% of the plasma current into ~10MeV runaways are predicted in ITER. If the resulting 25 to 50 MJ is deposited in a small region of the first wall or divertor, majo r damage to the PFCs is expected [2.b.5.5]. The high electron energies imply deep penetrat ion, which could resu lt in damage down to the cooling channels, particularly in the thinner PFCs anticipated for Demo. Two classes of mitigation strategies are bei ng studied for ITER. One involves controlling an existing runaway discharge and slowly ramping it down over more than 10 s. The other uses massive injection of particles, by one of the previously listed techniques, to slow the runaways. Extrapolation: The linkage between disruptions and runawa ys leads to the conclusion that avoiding disruptions in Demo should be sufficient to avoid runaway events. As described in the Disruption section, avoi dance requires the discovery of a high- performance regime that is either disruption free or that exhibits useful precursors. All of the additional challenges described above apply. If soft-stops are used as a mitigation tool, then massive electron injection will also be needed to mitigate the resulting runaway events. These requirements for Demo ex ceed those needed for ITER, and they necessitate major advances in understa nding and demonstrated performance. Large (Type I) ELMS Large edge-localized modes ( ELMs) are often found in plasmas with substantial pedestal pressure gradients and high confinement. Type I ELMS may be expected to dominate high confinement discharges in ITER and pose a significant challenge to PFCs in the divertor. Present empirical projections based on the low pedestal collisionality required for ITER indicate that the ELM energy will be 2 to 3 times greater than can be handled by the divertor. However there is substant ial uncertainty in the detailed physics basis governing ELM losses, and hence in these proj ections [2.b.5.6]. Other high-confinement 46regimes or techniques have been studied that are ELM free or exhibit only small ELMs. However, extrapolation of these regimes to ITER has not yet been demonstrated. Radiation has been used successfully to \"buffer\" small ELMs, but attempts to use this technique on Type I ELMS resulted in only ma rginal (<25% in JET) reduction in energy deposited [2.b.5.7]. Extrapolation: Uncertainty in the physics understandin g of ELMs energy losses makes projections to ITER uncertain, and to an AT Demo even more so. Research on present experiments, on ITER, and on the planned ne w large tokamaks operating in AT regimes should provide more empirical information and hopefully more fundamental understanding. This research may also lead to techniques for avoiding or mitigating Type I ELMs in Demo. Bursts of Energetic Alphas Some energetic alphas may be lost from bur ning plasmas in short, intense bursts that could seriously damage PFCs. Such losses have been observed in nonlinear numerical simulations of Alfven eigenmodes (AEs) and energetic particle modes (EPMs). Some experimental tests have been made and ot hers can be carried on planned non-burning tokamaks. However, the burning plasmas planned in ITER will be essential in the exploration of this issue [2.b.5.8]. Extrapolation: More understa nding is needed before the im pact of alpha bursts on Demo is understood. ITER will be the major experi mental source for this understanding. The higher density AT regime in Demo may mitigate these bursts. Status and Extrapolation of Appr oach 2: Stellarators, etc. This section compares the implications of the four types of off-normal plasma events just described for AT tokamaks with the implicatio ns for a stellarator-based Demo. It also comments on the relative maturity of unders tanding of stellarators and other concepts compared to the tokamak, and the extrapolations needed for Demo. Disruptions, Runaway Electrons, Large ELMS, and Bursts of Energetic Alphas Experiment and theory indicate that stellara tors can be operated without disruptions or runaway electron events. However, stellarators can suffer from radiative collapse or other unplanned plasma termination. Thought these occur over a relatively slow time scale, they would impose a time varying heat load on reactor components. Stellarator performance must be extended to the high-pe rformance confinement regimes required for Demo to ensure that these off-normal events can be completely avoided in such a regime. Stellarators can exhibit pede stals and ELMS, but not in al l high performance plasmas. For example, ELMs are generally not observe d in LHD, and were not observed in the W7-AS high beta experiments. Stellarators are predicted to support EPMs and AEs in a burning plasma at moderate densities, which could result in bursts of alpha particles 47being expelled. However, stellarators ty pically operate at sufficiently high plasma density so that these alpha-p article-driven modes are predic ted to be stable.(e.g. see Aries-CS). s. As noted earlier, the basi c physics of ELM energy losses is not well understood, but some empirical evidence in to kamaks indicates that higher density may result in higher collisionality in the pedestal leading to smaller, more easily mitigated ELMs. These conjectures would need to be tested and understood in a stellarator operating in a Demo-relevant regime. Extrapolation: A stellarator Demo would requi re the testing of a stellarator configuration that simultaneously demonstrates the required confinement and high-beta in steady-state operation, while avoiding all off-normal even ts including various types of thermal collapse. Here again \"off-normal\" means any events that can cause serious damage to PFCs or other structures. For disruptions a nd runaways, this means maintaining presently observed behavior. For ELMs, it means operati ng in a confinement regime that reliably does not have ELMs or alpha bursts, it mean s operating at sufficien tly high density so that the relevant modes are not predicted to be unstable. It also re quires that the plasma not exhibit any new unexpected type of off-normal event. The reversed field pinch (RFP) configurati on does not exhibit ELMs (it has no H-mode pedestal) or tokamak-like disruptions. But si nce most of the magnetic energy is due to current in the plasma, disruptions in the RFP wo uld be dangerous. It remains to be seen if disruptions occur as the RFP concept matures toward longer pulse and higher current. Other toroidal configurations are even le ss well developed, and could exhibit very different off-normal event behavior that might be easier to control or mitigate. The extrapolation to a Demo would be much gr eater for the RFP or other configurations. It is not likely that they could advance rapi dly enough to be ready for a Demo-regime test on the timescale being considered in this repor t. However, allowing them to advance at an appropriate pace could lead to improve d understanding of the physics underlying off- normal events and help find solutions for tokamaks or stellarators.

Plasma Modification by Auxiliary Systems: Establish the physics and engineering science of auxiliary systems wh ich can provide power, particles, current and rotation at the appropriate locations in th e plasma at the appropriate intensity. In order to achieve the conditions needed for high performance core, edge and SOL plasmas in steady-state with the combined pe rformance characteristics required for Demo, methods need to be developed and applied that can modify plasma parameters using external means. The parameters that need to be modified include plasma temperature, current, density, current profile, pressure profile , stabilization of instabilities, plasma fuel mixture ratio, impurity content, shape and rotation. A variety technologies have b een exploited over the years to produce external plasma manipulation. These can be grouped into the categories of Plasma Heating, Current Drive, Fueling and Exhaust Control, Shaping, and Edge Control. Technologies utilized are high velocity neutral particles, microwav es, radio waves, gas valves, frozen hydrogen pellets, magnetic coils, high speed switching power supplies, and liquid cryogen cooled vacuum pumps. The extrapolations of these technologies to the needs of Demo will be discussed below and range from extensive development needed to readily available commercially. All technologies will have to be evaluated for robustness, reliability and compatibility in the Demo environment. a. Plasma Heating To reach the temperatures necessary for si gnificant amounts of fusion reach energy needs to be deposited into the plasma at various locations. While fusion power supplies most of the required heat in a high gain burning plasma , some level of auxiliary plasma heating is needed for startup, sustainment and control. New systems and technologies have to be developed or expanded to meet the requirement s of Demo Systems which may be used to heat the plasmas are: 1. Ohmic Heating - Magnetic configurations that are based on the tokamak, such as ITER, use internally driven current in the plasma to achieve stability and increased confinement. This form of heating is not sufficient to achieve high fusion gain with attainable values for the magnetic field. 2. Ion Cyclotron Heating- Energy from ra dio waves in the Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies, ICRF, can be transfe rred to the plasma ions under resonant conditions or to electrons if the wave group velocity is lowered to match the electron velocity. ICRF is the main hea ting system for most Demo concepts. ICRF will be used on ITER and other Steady State tokamaks, which will establish a sound technologi cal data base for the performance of ICRF systems. Experience on present day devices are indicating that the antenna-plasma gap should be increased because of lifetime concerns of the antenna, 49leading to poor plasma-antenna coupli ng. To mitigate this concern new concepts to enhance RF coupling or provide wider bandwidth need to be pursued, with the realization that any new concept will need to be validated on existing devices prior to implementation on Demo. A proposal for ITER to provide gas puffing in front of the antenna to incr ease coupling may not be practical for Demo owing to the large gas load placed upon the plasma, again leading to the need to explore new c oncepts. The understanding and potential solution to these issues will be he lped by the development of improved integrated models of the coupling ne twork, antenna, and wave physics in nuclear environment - validated with experiments and diagnostics. 3. Electron Cyclotron Heating (ECH) - The energy from Electron Cyclotron waves can be transferred to electrons where the wave frequency matches a low-order multiple of the electron gyro frequency, a localized resonance phenomena in most magnetic configurat ions. The waves can not penetrate a plasma whose density produces a plasma frequency higher than the wave frequency. Because of the highly localized energy deposition, ECH is typically used for locali zed plasma modification, and plasma breakdown at startup. Since there is no wave-pla sma coupling requirements, the EC beam can be simply steered to the location desired using mirrors. The EC waves are produced in electron tubes called gyrotrons. The gyrotrons developed for ITER operate at 170 GHz, 1 - 2 MW, and cw operations. For several of the Demo concepts these gyrotrons will be sufficient. However, there are versions that operate at high ma gnetic fields or at high densities. For these applications higher frequency sources, 250 -300 GHz, will be required. Since the economics of EC Systems w ould improve with larger unit powers, development of higher power gyrotrons would reduce the capital cost of Demo. It is anticipated that for Demo , the plasma facing mirrors will have severe erosion and deposition issues, similar issues exist for ITER, and operating experience on ITER will form a good basis towards Demo. 4. Neutral Beam Injection, NBI - High veloc ity neutral particles can be injected into the plasma, where when ionized by collisions, they become trapped on the magnetic field lines. These trapped ion transfer their energy to the plasma through multiple collisions with plasma pa rticles. The velocity of the neutral particles is required to be high enough so that most of the energy is deposited in the center of the plasma, but not so high that they pene trate through to the far wall of the vacuum chamber. Fo r ITER 1 MeV neutral particles are required. If the NBI beam is launc hed in a more tangential direction momentum is imparted to the plasma producing plasma rotation. By having multiple NB Injectors with opposite toroidal tangency, it has been demonstrated that plasma rotation can be controlled. Most Demo concepts have higher dens ity plasmas than ITER, therefore to penetrate to the core, higher energy ~ 1. 5 - 2 MeV, neutral particles would be needed. The technical ch allenge of developing su ch high-energy neutral beams has forced all present concepts of Demo to forego the use of NBI as a heating system. NBI for rotation control may still be possible. 50b. Plasma Current Drive For the tokamak, plasma current plays a key role in providing for plasma stability and confinement. For steady-state operation the pl asma current will have to be produced in a non-pulsed (non-inductive) manner, and because of the low current drive efficiencies of most non-inductive means, a high fraction of internally generated current (bootstrap current) is desirable. However, high perfor mance plasmas, with high bootstrap currents are susceptible to inst abilities, where tearing modes crea te zones of zero or low bootstrap current. It has been demonstrated on severa l tokamaks that these zones can be prevented from growing by compensating for the lost bootstrap current by injecting localized current into the zones. Approaches for non-inductive current drive are: 1. Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) - LH CD is the primary choice of auxiliary current drive for steady state Demo concepts. This comes from the high current drive efficiencies as compared with othe r wave-plasma current drive technologies. Long pulse experience from ITER and ot her Steady State devi ces could dictate that the launcher-plasma gap be increased because of lifetime concerns, leading to poor coupling; gas puffing in front of the antenna to increase coupling may not be practical for Demo owing to the large gas load placed upon the plasma; alternate launcher concepts need to be validated for effectiveness and functionality prior to use on Demo. 2. Electron Cyclotron Current Drive (ECCD ) - Electron Cyclotron waves when launched tangentially to the plasma result s in localized current deposition, where the microwave beam crosses the resonant magnetic field shell, by using focusing mirrors the localization of current can be only a few cm wide. This precise localization makes ECCD a prime candidate for suppression of NTM instabilities, and modification of the current density profiles as needed to support high performance plasmas. Issues with ECCD 3. Ion Cyclotron Current Drive (ICCD) - Energy from radio waves in the Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies, ICRF, can be transferred to el ectrons if the wave group velocity is lowered to match the electron velocity. This requires antennas with multiple straps with the phasing be tween straps adjusted to produce the appropriate k parallel. I ssues for ICCD sources and launchers are similar to those for ICRF heating. 4. Neutral Beam Injection Current Drive (NBCD) - By aligning the neutral beam injectors such that the path of the neutral particles are approximately tangential to the plasma core, energy is preferentially transferred to the electrons by collisions, driving current in the direct ion of the beam. Owing to th e large size of the neutral beam, it is normally used as a central current driv e tool, although by aiming the injector slightly off-center some off-axis current drive can be achieved, albeit with a broad profile. Issues for NBCD technol ogy are similar to those for NBI heating. c. Fueling and Exhaust Control Operation of Demo at high fusion power production, will require that the fuel concentration in the core of the plasma be controlled continuously, with replacement of 51D-T fuel and removal of He ash. Particularly important will be the ability to measure the isotopic mix in the core, enabling the op timization of the fusion performance. In most operating magnetic confinement de vices fueling is achieved by gas puffing, which is also planned for ITER but is not expected to be effective at core fueling. For ITER fueling of the core is to be achieved by high speed frozen D-T pellets injected on the low or high field edge of the plasma. Fueling of a Demo reactor poses significant scientific and technological issues beyond our present kn owledge of fueling tokamak plasmas. The primary issues arise from the steady state nature of a Demo and its anticipated operation at high density wi th significant tritium fueling throughput requirements. The areas where further knowledge will be needed for Demo are in fueling physics, isotopic control, steady-state oper ation, tritium handling, and technology reliability. New technological solutions for core fueling will most likely be needed, which should be first tested on test stands and later tried on opera ting devices such as ITER or other magnetic confinement devices. d. Shaping The ability to manipulate the plasma shape is critical to obtaining optimum plasma performance. Critical shape characteristi cs that need controlling are; elongation, triangularity, edge-wall gap, radial position, sepa ratrix position, divertor footprint, etc. These manipulations are achieved by magnetic coils located appropriately around the plasma, connected to high speed power suppl ies, responding to commands from the Plasma Control System, which utilizes a variety of sensors to predict the plasma shape real-time. In general, shape control coils must be loca ted far from the plasma edge, providing room for shielding the superconducting material. However, the need to manipulate the outer surface of the plasma with three-dimensional fields, for example with coils designed to inhibit the presence of Edge Localized M odes (ELM), or Resistive Wall Modes (RWM), may require coils placed relatively close to th e plasma. This will likely rule out the use of superconducting materials and require the development of liquid or gas cooled coils that can survive the heat and neutron flue nce near the plasma boundary. Edge pressure control by resonant magnetic perturbation (R MP) coils is being evaluated by the ITER Design Review Program e. Edge Rotation Control Edge rotation can improve performance by produc ing radial velocity shear, which acts to stabilize micro-turbulence a nd thereby improving plasma confinement. With much lower input torque than most current experiments and lower *, predictions suggest that the rotation in ITER may be below the threshold where the radial velocity shear can be effective. Thus alternate means to enhance plasma rotation may be needed. Two methods have been demonstrated with this capability, neutral beams injected tangentially, and ICRF waves (primarily Ion Bernstein Wave s, IBW), which can drive plasma poloidal flows. RF driven poloidal flow and tangential neutral beam injection is not presently part of the ITER base line program, however these could be added as part of an ITER AT enhancement program. 522.b.7. Magnets: Understand the engineering and materials science needed to provide economic, robust, reliable, main tainable magnets for plasma confinement, stability and control. Magnets are the quintessenti al enabling technology for ma gnetic confinement and are typically the most expensive component in the construction of MF E experiments. While the current level of understanding for fu sion-relevant superconducting magnets is sufficient for an device like ITER, we note that designs for two leading tokamak reactor studies, ARIES-RS with BT=8 T and ARIES- AT with high-tempera ture superconductors, are significant extrapolations from ITER. Im provements in performance, cost, reliability and maintainability will only be obtained af ter significant research. The goal of this research is to have the capabilities in ha nd for producing more reliable, more compact, higher-field, lower-cost magnets for future devices like Demo. Currently, superconducting magnets are designed with large safety margins because of incomplete understanding of th eir properties. For example, existing codes cannot self- consistently predict the dist ribution of strains and electr ical current in superconducting cable. Also lacking is the ability to pred ict crack growth and damage in composite materials. Large safety margins are also needed because the lack of adequate quench detection diagnostics require s very conservative magnet pr otection designs. Nuclear effects including heating in the conductor and damage to thermal and electrical insulators have not been fully characterized. High-te mperature superconductors have the potential to enable operation at higher magnetic field in the fusion geometry. However this is a less mature technology and will require significant research before they can be employed reliably in fusion devices. For example, high-temperature superconductors, quench propagation slows about three orders of magnitude from 10m/s to 10mm/s, requiring development and integration of new techniques (optical perhaps) for quench detection. The focus in magnet research for fusion is ofte n on the toroidal field coils since they are the largest and require the highe st fields. However the poloidal field coils used for shape control and current drive and the helical or modular coils need for stellarators raise additional issues. Control coils, for thei r function, must carry time varying current which leads to internal heating. This de mands care in their design and in the plasma control systems which drive them. Coils for stellarators require very complicated and very precise control of geometry. Recent experience in construction of stellarators with modular coils suggests that th e challenges are formidable. With further research, a wide range of opportunities are available to improve superconducting magnet performance. Adva nces are possible in the underlying superconducting material - whether standard or high-temperature variants are used. The latter, because they maintain their high critical current-densities at higher magnetic fields, offer the possibility of higher-field reactor operation, increasing the headroom with respect to plasma physics limits. Higher temperature operation could simplify the cryogenics systems and reduce cooling power re quirements. Better structural materials or better designs could allow higher stress. Th e following opportunities for improvement in superconducting magnet designs have been identified: 531. Improved modeling and testing techniques to validate integrated simulation of thermal, electrical and mechanical prope rties of superconducting magnet systems. 2. Improvements in low-temperature supe rconducting strand, including current carrying capacity and stability 3. Improvements in high-tempe rature superconducting strand 4. Innovative approaches to design fu sion magnets with high-temperature superconductors 5. Innovative quench diagnostics and pr otection systems to allow higher performance and lower design margin 6. Improvements in conductor conduit to allow better to lerance to NbSn heat treatment 7. Electrical and thermal insulators capable of operating in nuclear environment 8. Better insulator properties for cooling lin es, which could allow higher voltage and lower current operation 9. Improved manufacturing techniques to lower costs In realizing these opportunities, a vigorous magnet research program that studies materials and components could be much less expensive than construction and testing of large prototypes. Extrapolation parameters for low temperature superconductors Metric Current Value Required Value Extrapolation JEFF 500 A/mm2 1000 above, high temperature superc onductors offer additional opportunities for magnet improvements, but will require substantial research and development. These materials have shown the ability to carry hi gh current densities at fields beyond the capacity of low-temperature materials. The principle challenge for exploiting high- temperature superconductors arises from their physical form. These conductors are mostly forms of copper oxide crystals and inhe rently difficult to form into the large-scale wires or plates. Instead, high-temperatur e superconducting magnets are typically made by winding flexible, though fragile, tapes. Innovative designs, using thick films deposited on structural material s are being pursued. It is pos sible that such designs could allow construction of demountable s uperconducting magnets which would ease maintenance for fusion systems. Many proposals for future experiments requir e long-pulse, high-performance resistive magnets (usually copper or copper alloys). For example, spherical tokamak geometry is hard to obtain if substantial neutron shieldi ng is required over the i nner leg of the toroidal 54Extrapolations for high te mperature superconductors Metric Current Value Required Value Extrapolation Factor Cost $160/kA-m 10/kA-m 15 JEFF (Current Density) 500 A/mm2 1000 A/mm2 2 Piece size (unbroken length) 200 kA-m 50 MA-m 250 Design Stress 60 - 500 MPa 100 - 250 MPa ~1 field magnet, as it is for superconductors. And while heating of normal conductors by radiation is not quite as seve re as for superconductors, ques tions remain about activation, neutron damage to structural components an d the survival of thermal and electrical insulators. Copper magnets are typically cheaper and mo re robust those made with superconductors, but must be carefully de signed for heat removal in long-pulse applications. Such magnets, if they are to be operated economically, must be designed to minimize electrical power dissipation. De mountable joints, which are desirable for preserving the maintainability of fusion sy stems, are relatively straightforward for resistive magnets. Although a fairly matu re technology, there are opportunities to improve the performance of resistive magnets . Historically, magnets for fusion systems cost 20 to 90 times the cost of the bare conduc tor. Experts believe that with simplified conductor and coil designs a reduction of at le ast 2 could be realized. The following opportunities for improvement in resistive magnet designs have been identified: 1. Improvements in conducting materials, including new alloys or composites 2. Extended performance and operating life fo r thermal and electrical insulators, especially resistance to radiation damage 3. Sliding demountable joints or fixed demountable joints 4. Improved conductor joining processes, to avoid degrading the structural properties of conductor near the joints. 5. Improvements in manufacturing techniques to reduce fabrication cost and time 6. Improvements in modeling the coupled thermal, electrical and mechanical properties of magnets including nuclear da mage, embrittlement, crack growth, etc. 7. Innovative designs which allow hi gher field and/or lower cost. 8. Optimization of active cooling designs to ex tend the available pul se length and/or field strength As with superconducting magnets, realizing th ese improvements will require a vigorous research program. 2.b.8. Plasma-Wall Interactions: Understand and control of a ll processes which couple the plasma and nearby materials. The complex coupling of a high-temperature plasma to material surfaces remains a major scientific challenge. Pressure balance, includi ng ram pressure and coll isions with neutrals, is approximately maintained along the field lin es which connect the main plasma with the divertor surface, but intense heat fluxes ar e driven by temperature gradients along these 55field lines. The ultimate interaction with the divertor surface involves pre-sheath gradients, and sheaths which acc elerate impurities pr eferentially into th e divertor plate, resulting in enhanced sputtering erosion. Cross-field transport can result in large particle flux, and significant heat flux, being deposited at the main chamber first wall, or at the entrance to the divertor. Whereas transport al ong open field lines is generally believed to be classical, cross-field transp ort is not understood. There is an effort to build a science based model to explain edge plasma conditions from the top of the pedestal to material surfaces, but the effort is just beginning. As complex as these phenomena are during normal operation, additional difficulties are encountered in fully understanding off-normal events, which can result in vaporizati on of plasma facing co mponent surfaces and self-shielding. Demo concepts are typically pr edicted to have more severe edge plasma conditions than ITER. a. Erosion of the plasma facing surface of th e first wall is caused by physical sputtering, chemical mechanisms yielding volatile species, or evaporation at high temperature. Not all of these processes are applicable to all materials. Many of the mechanisms are dependent on plasma particle flux and temper ature. If the PFCs are composed of more than one material there can be either a re duction or increase in erosion depending on the materials. Research on mixed material effect s is relatively new. Er osion and redeposition may lead to the formation of dust that may contain tritium and create a risk of strong reactions with coolant in case of a loss of coolant accident. The complex interactions between the hydrogen and helium particle flux to a surface mixed with multiple impurities are not well understood. ITER will pr ovide important data on erosion because it is a long pulse device and because the ba seline configuration has mixed materials, however, the step to Demo requires an increase in duty factor by at least a factor of 10. Control of the interaction between the plasma and surrounding materials has been accomplished through the use of coatings applied to the surfaces, special conditioning plasmas that scrub the wall, and baking of the device. Extrapolation: The integrated plasma operating time on exis ting devices is one to two orders of magnitude less than ITER and, on Demo, will be one to two orders of magnitude longer yet. This means that the thickness of redeposited films will be proportionally thicker. The deposition will alter the surface properties in ways that have not been measured. On existing machines, the ratio of time spent conditioning the walls to the time spent operating with high performance plasmas is much greater than one. For Demo this ratio must be much less than one. ITER has the ability to explore ratios around one. All plasma-wall interactions are sens itive to the surface temperature of plasma- facing components. No device in the world program, including ITER, will be capable of operation with a first wall temperature in the range of ~600C, as is desired for Demo. b. Impurity generation is the result of erosion of the plasma facing wall. All of the erosion mechanisms produce a flux of impurities toward the plasma. Extrapolation: There is increas ing understanding of the tran sport of impurities from the wall or divertor to the main plasma but extr apolation is required to simulate Demo. In particular, the understanding of the transport of impurities in the scrape-off layer and pedestal region must be increased. ITER will provide important data if the edge has sufficient diagnostics. 56c. Tritium retention has been observed on bot h of the DT tokamaks. Between 20 and 50% of the tritium injected in the plasma was reta ined in the graphite plasma facing materials. Deuterium experiments on other devices have been analyzed to show much lower retention but the interpretation of the data is much more difficult. ITER will provide extremely accurate data on retention because of the high tritium input and long pulse length. Demo will have much higher neutr on fluence than ITER and operate at higher temperatures. Tritium retention on Demo must be accurately predicted using a validated code as part of th e licensing process. Extrapolation: Because of safety consideratio ns the in-vessel releasable tritium inventory in ITER is limited to ~100 gm. Experience shows that this level may be accumulated in 100-1000 discharges on ITER. Because of higher operating temperatures and greater tritium consumption on Demo, the allowed in ventory is likely to be reduced. Coupled with low tritium retention, plasma facing mate rials chosen for Demo must also have low impurity emission (whether due to physical sput tering, chemical erosion, or evaporation). The much thicker redeposited layers on ITER and Demo will have the ability to trap much larger quantities of tritium. It will be much more difficult to remove trapped tritium from the thicker layers. ITER must partiall y solve this problem but Demo will require even more improvement because of increased operating time (roughly ten times). ITER should provide data on the equi libration of particles betwee n the wall and the plasma. Demo will probe even further into the regi me where higher operating temperatures and greater neutron damage increase the depth to which particles can communicate with the plasma. d. Particle and heat loads (including partic le control, plasma compatibility with liquid PFC) See Sections 2.b.6 and 2.b.9. e. Particle recycling and pumping requirements See Section 2.b.6. Associated coupling and integration issues Ideally, a plasma facing material would have the low sputter and evaporation yield of a high Z refractory metal, the low Z of Be or C, and low tritium retention simultaneously. It is a delicate optimization process to find a ma terial that can be constructed from the existing elements and do the best job of satisfying these seemingly conflicting requirements. Plasma wall interactions can alter the scrape-off layer plasma (impurity radiation, recombination, temper ature dependent sheath, etc.). 2.b.9. Plasma Facing Components: Understand the materials and processes that can be used to design replaceable components whic h can survive the enormous heat, plasma and neutron fluxes without degrading the perf ormance of the plasma or compromising the fuel cycle. a. Overall Design issues (inc luding heat flux removal enhanc ement techniques (e.g., swirl tape), surface shape optimization or generaliz ation for margin, regulatory requirements, stress and strain allowables a nd testing regimes.) It is th eoretically possible to optimize the shape of a plasma facing component to minimize the heat flux to the surface. In practice, the lack of ability to perfectly align the component with field lines or 57irregularities in the field structure make th e application of such an optimized surface subject to higher peak heat flux than a less optimized surface that is designed to accommodate unexpected irregularities in alignment. A variety of heat removal enhancement devices have been tested for the coolant channels in a PFC. The majority of those experiments have been done for water cooling. Extrapolation: Only a few preliminary expe riments have been done for gas coolants which are preferred for Demo. Improved heat transfer techniques that work for water cooling are generally not appli cable for gas cooling. New me thods must be invented and tested. While the properties of the major mate rials used for PFC have carefully measured properties, the joint between the plasma faci ng material and the heat sink is typically a few microns thick and is composed of interm etallics whose propert ies are uncertain and where measurements of properties after neutro n irradiation are not available. Extensive heat flux testing of new designs must be c onducted on test stands and the designs applied to long pulse fusion devices (non-nuclear) before the designs can be considered for Demo. In addition to being the first burning plasma device, ITER will also test the design process for actively cooled components w ith significant neutron fluence (~0.3 DPA). ITER will provide the first data on failure modes and effects and the ability to replace actively cooled PFCs in a fusion device. Si nce Demo will have 100 times the neutron fluence and 2-5 times more heat flux, the understanding of plasma facing component design must be gained from experiments in addition to ITER. Movi ng liquid PFC designs offer both unique capabilities to remove h eat and resist neutr on damage and unique challenges for design and modeling . b. Materials Issues (including reduced activ ation, adequate thermal conductivity (after irradiation), high operating temperature capab ility (600-1000C), joining methods to heat sink, coolant compatibility (oxygen content of He gas) Efficient removal of the plasma heat flux to PFC requires mate rials with moderate to hi gh thermal conductivity. Because of the desire to operate PFC at high temper ature for efficient power conversion, solid materials must be refractory. Only a few ca ndidate starting elements can be considered for PFC because of these restrictions. The lowe st activation material in this category is tungsten. Tungsten has a high ductile to brit tle transition temperature (DBTT) that is raised by neutron irradiation. Alloying W to decrease the DBTT always decreases the thermal conductivity. Research in Japan and el sewhere is providing clues as to how to improve the properties of tungsten (and mol ybdenum) without a pronounced decrease in thermal conductivity.. Helium gas cooling of refractory metals requires very low oxygen levels in the He gas. There is a small research effort in Russia to develop joining materials that can be used for W and Mo PFCs. Extrapolation: Demo will require creation of new improved refractory metal alloys (most likely tungsten but molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and vanadium are possible candidates depending on the heat flux). These new materials will have to be fully characterized in both the unirradiated and neut ron irradiated condition. Effective methods for oxygen contamination control in helium gas must be discovered. Robust methods for joining refractory plasma facing materials to refractory heat sinks are necessary. Refractory heat sinks are likely to ne ed creative joining techniques also. 58 c. Thermal Issues (following neutron irradiation, including cyclic fatigue, thermal creep, fracture toughness, fracture mechanics at interfaces.) Neutron irradiation typically hardens materials while decreasing ductility and fracture toughness. Extrapolation: See mate rials section b above. d. Mitigated disruptions that may cause significant melting of the entire first wall Extrapolation: Some of the disruption and runaway electron mitigation schemes could cause intense heat loads on the first wall. Owing to the inherently higher surface- normalized energies in Demo, achieving effectiv e mitigation without this side effect will be even more challenging in Demo than it will be in ITER. These intense heat loads will cause brief high stress at the he at sink to plasma facing material interface. It is not known whether such a sudden stress will lead to fr acture of an irradiat ed interface layer. e. Reliability/maintainability (following neut ron irradiation, including mean time between failures mean time to repair, safety issues related to loss of coolant, loss of flow or loss of vacuum, diagnosis of engineering performance) There is very litt le experience with actively cooled PFCs on fusion devices. The da tabase is insufficient to determine the failure mechanisms and the mean time between failures. Off-normal events create spikes of temperature and stress that may create crack s or defects that can lead to failure during subsequent normal operation. A great deal of research must be done to understand the failure mechanisms and develop the statistics needed to guide preventative maintenance. ITER will help to develop this data but more engineering diagnostics are needed to effectively gather the data from ITER. Extrapolation: Since Demo will have helium gas cooled refractory metal PFCs, the database needed to qualify designs for Demo will have to be developed on machines other than ITER. If those devices are non-nuc lear, they must have long pulse lengths, operate at high temperature, and exclusiv ely use remote maintenance techniques for exchange and repair of PFCs. f. Tritium Issues (with neutron irradiation, including tritium (hydrogen) effects on materials and permeation) Permeation of tritium through PFC to the coolant must be included in the design of the coolant systems. Some materials (e.g., Ti, V, Ta) are known to be susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Tritium retention in PFCs must be limited to avoid safety issues related to T i nventory or release during accidents. Extrapolation: Permeation will only be significant for devices that have large tritium throughput or fluence to the PFCs. It can on ly be measured on components tested in devices like CTF or Demo. La boratory measurements will provide data on representative specimens of the designs chosen (measurements on irradiated specimens are also possible). 59g. Liquid Surface PFCs (including liquid compa tibility with structur es, MHD effects on moving conducting liquids due to spatially a nd temporally varying magnetic fields, HDT pumping capability, He pumping capability, no zzles and flow collec tion structures, test facilities) Liquid surface PFCs avoid the majori ty of the deleterious effects of neutron irradiation, erosion, and off-normal events. There are no thermal stresses in a liquid so cyclic fatigue and creep are not an issue. The peak operating te mperature of a liquid surface is limited by evaporation from the li quid surface. The precise temperature limit depends on the transport of the evaporated to the plasma which is uncertain. In general, the expected temperature limits are below thos e desired for the highest thermal efficiency (400-600 C rather than 600-1000 C). A flowing li quid surface has a rema rkable ability to remove heat flux since the coolant is direct ly exposed to the heat flux. Some liquid coolants (Li) can efficiently pump hydrogen at oms but the ability to pump He atoms has not been demonstrated. The major issue to be solved is the effect of currents induced in the liquid by either spatially or temporally varying magnetic fields. Other sources of current include plasma thermal gradients, plas ma motion, and particle flux transients such as ELMs. Models are being developed to compute the response of free surface conducting liquids to the induced currents. In fusion applications both the Hartman number and the Magnetic Interaction Pa rameter are large which complicates the simulations. Experiments that can be used to check the modeling have only been performed at parameters that are not very similar to fusion devices. Experiments on fusion devices are very few and only performed on small low field devices. Extrapolation: While restrained static liquids have demonstrated beneficial effects on plasma performance, moving surface liquids have never been successfully deployed on a fusion device.. The sequence of events required to apply liquid surfaces on Demo will include laboratory tests of flowing free su rface liquids in spatially varying magnetic fields to begin validation of MHD models; application of flowing liquids as PFCs in a near term fusion device havi ng a few second pulse length, s cale-up experiments in a long pulse fusion device (e.g., KSTAR, JT60-SA, etc. ); and prototype designs tested in a CTF like device. These experiments will confirm the MHD models used for design, stability of the liquid in the presence of plasma, and pa rticle recycling and pum ping effects. Flowing liquids are a large extrapolation from e xperience on fusion devices but they are considered because they can eliminate many of the problems that confront solid surface PFCs. Liquids have both hi gh risk and high pay-off. h. Susceptibility/robustness to off-normal events See Section 8 above for a discussion of th e effects of off-normal events on PFCs. Actively cooled PFCs have grea ter sensitivity to off normal events because the portion of the component closest to the plasma must the thin to allow heat flow to the coolant. In general, more severe or frequent off-normal events lead to lower the maximum heat flux requirements for normal operation and shorter lifetimes before replacement. Extrapolation: The majority of fusion device s operate with thermally thick plasma facing components (the plasma heat input is stored in the specific heat of the material and released slowly after a discha rge and is therefor e robust against off-normal events). The one notable exception is TORE SUPRA which has provided valuable insight on the 60design of actively cooled PFCs. Several devi ces either under constr uction or planned may provide further insight before ITER operate s, although none of them will be DT devices. Because the stored energy in Demo is larger than ITER, the effects of off-normal events will be more severe on Demo. Associated coupling and integration issues Selection of the plasma facing material on a PFC must meet all the requirements described in section 8 while simultaneously transmitting plasma thermal energy to a heat sink. Because of the need for high temperatur e (600-1000 C) refractory materials must be used but such materials generally have high Z and make impurity control more difficult. There is a very limited database with high plasma performance simultaneous with plasma facing surfaces composed entirely of high Z materials. 2.b.10. RF Antennas, Launching Structures and Other Internal Components: Establish the necessary understanding of pl asma interactions, neutron loading and materials to allow design of RF antennas and launchers, control coils, final optics and any other diagnostic equipment which can surv ive and function within the plasma vessel. Functional internal components (antennas, sensor s, mirrors, control coils, etc.) must meet the criteria of other pl asma facing components (see section 2. b.9) in terms of resistance to high (~1-10 MW/m 2) heat and neutron fluxes and acceptable levels of impurity production, while in addition maintaining the cap ability to perform heating, diagnostic, or control functions. Internal com ponents can also suffer damage if they lie in the path of particle fluxes produced in off-normal events; an important example of such a scenario is the production of runaway electrons dur ing a tokamak plasma disruption. Internal RF antennas and microwave launch structures or mirrors present special challenges, as these component s are energized with high inte nsity electromagnetic fields with amplitudes ~ 10-100 kV/m. These fields can accelerate partic les along field lines and create DC plasma sheath structures: both these phenomena can lead to focused particle and energy fluxes on the antennas or launchers themselves, as well as other components or surfaces intersected by the field lines. Most presently operating high-pow er toroidal fusion experiments are pulsed, and have limited neutron fluxes (only those resulting fr om D-D operation). Fo r these experiments, heat loads are handled inertially, and partic le deposition on components can either be tolerated (as with antennas or limiters), li mited by the use of sha dowing or shutters, or periodically removed or replaced (as is requ ired for mirrors, windows, or lenses to continue functioning). Long-pulse, non-nuclear experiments like Tore Supra add active cooling to all internal components, and de velopment of these techniques has occurred progressively based on experience over ~20 years. Newer non-nuclear, superconducting long pulse devices and W7X, JT-60SA, KSTAR, EAST [under with neutron irradiation facilities (e.g. IFMIT, SNS) and high heat flux facilities as well as D-T operation on ITER will be required to fully test and qualify these components. 61 For remotely maintained D-T experiments, the performance criteria for internal components become more demanding, as replacement or repair is complicated. Shadowing of components may be required in some cases (e.g., mirrors) where extensive particle deposition can impede function. The key capabilities required for the development and deployment of effective and durable internal components in fusion reactors are: a. Reliable and verified techni ques for predicting particle , heat, and neutron fluxes on passive components (e.g. sensors, mirrors, etc) in realistic geometry in both normal and off-normal operating conditions. These are three-dimensional models of the charged particle, neutron, and elec tromagnetic radiation source functions in the reacting plasma that can be used to calculate in detail the distribution of fluxes. Development of these capabilities requires detailed modeling and targeted experiments with appropriate edge plasma and radiation diagnostics. b. Reliable and verified techniques for com puting self-consistent heat and particle fluxes to high-power, energized compone nts (RF antennas, microwave launchers, etc) which interact with and alter the edge plasma. This development requires the integration of fully 3-D RF heating code s with realistic antenna and confinement device geometry, and targeted experiment s with innovative diagnostics that can measure plasma parameters in the edge plasma wherein heating power is flowing into the plasma and exhaust power is flowing out to the active component. c. Structural, shield and coating materials with which to construct internal components, and appropriate joining/bonding technologies. These materials must be able to withstand the intense heat, particle and neutron fluxes of a fusion reactor for reasonable operation lifetimes, without excess impurity generation, and will need to be fully qualified in materials testing facilities. These requirements are essentially similar to those for other plas ma-facing components and can use the same testing techniques. However, use for active components like antennas may add additional materials requirements for conductivity, etc. Layered sandwich materials or coating may be required to assure the function of components like antennas or mirrors. d. Verified 3-D design concepts and tec hniques for cooled internal components. In addition, active components delivering power to the plasma need cooling both for their power delivery function and for absorbing flux from the plasma. 2.b.11. Fusion Fuel Cycle: Learn and test how to manage the flow of tritium throughout the entire plant, including breeding and recovery. a. Solid breeders (including irradiation sintering, operating temperature, tritium permeation to sweep gas. tritium permeati on to coolant and from sweep gas piping. 62neutron multiplier material and structure, breeding material and structure, TBR control) The solid breeder materials developed for fusion are typically ceramic materials (Li 2O, LiTiO 3, LiZrO 3) formed into pebbles to ease diffusion of Tritium created into the sweep gas (He). Since these materials operate at high temperature and absorb large neutron fluence, they are susceptible to sintering and loss of porosity. Solid breeders require a neutron multiplier (Be or TiBe 12 pebbles). The multiplier can react with oxygen contamination in the He sweep gas, which might be controlled by Ti added to the multiplier. The pebble size is set by the diffusivity of T in the materials. Insufficient diffusion will cause excess T inventory in the breeder and safety issues. The rate of tritium breeding is very sensit ive to the neutron spectrum and hence the layers of material between the plasma and the breeder. If more severe off-normal events must be absorbed by the first wall then the first wall will require greater thickness and lead to lower tritium breeding. Since tritium breeding ratios are only slightly greater than one, loss of tritium by permeation through the sweep gas piping will complicate the tritium recovery system (more gas to be processed from more pipes). Extrapolation: Measurements of sintering of ceramic breeders have been made on unirradiated materials only. The effect of neutrons on the sintering is unknown. Addition of Ti to the multiplier has been shown to greatly decrease oxygen reaction, but the fabrication of the very brittle TiBe 12 material has not been perfected. Various permeation barriers have been tested in neutron environm ents and nearly all have reduced permeation by a factor or roughly two not 10 to 100 as de sired. Development of permeation barriers will be useful for applications other than fusion, e.g., tritium production in commercial reactors. b. Liquid breeders (including material compatib ility and corrosion, MHD effects, thermal insulators, tritium permeation through pipes of h eat exchanger, structural material choice, TBR control) Liquid breeders span a wide range of atomic number from pure liquid Li to Li2BeF4 (Flibe) to PbLi eutectic. Only pure Li needs a neutron multiplier. Both PbLi and Flibe have very low tritium solubility and n eed very effective tritium permeation barriers that are compatible with corrosive liqui ds. Double wall pipes w ith a He sweep gas between the pipes may be necessary for liqui d breeders (concentration of T in the sweep gas will be low). Flowing the liquid through a section of pipe made from a highly permeable material like Pd is considered fo r liquid breeders except Li. Liquid Li has high solubility for tritium and the T must be chemically separated. Extrapolation: No effective permeation barrier s have been found for liquid Flibe or PbLi that are compatible with the desired operating temperature. Chemistry control of the mixed liquid breeders has not been tested at any scale close to that required for Demo. Chemical separation of T from liquid Li has not be demonstrated at rates even close to that required for Demo. c. Recovery (including separation of T from He gas or liquid metal, recovery of low concentration T from permeation protection, process test experiment) See above. 63d. Tritium processing (including isotope separation and impurity removal, steady state control of processing at high throughput (~10X ITER), accountability to about +/- 2 gm, chemical plant handling kilogr am quantities of T, system s integration) The tritium processing system for Demo must have about 10 times the throughput of the ITER system. In addition, the Demo plant must operate continuously (ITER can use batch mode). Because tritium is a controlled nuclear material, the plant must be able to account for tritium with an accuracy of about \u00b12 gm (out of the kilograms being processed). Extrapolation: There has neve r been a tritium plant capable of meeting the Demo needs anywhere. One order of magnitude extrapolatio n for a chemical plant usually requires 5- 10 years for development and testing even if the need for special accounting for tritium, which is required for licensing, is neglected. Associated coupling and integration issues Circulating tritium inventory and accident consequences (T release and no evacuation criteria, exclusion zone) 2.b.12. Power Extraction: Understand how to extract fusion power at temperatures sufficiently high for efficient produc tion of electricity or hydrogen. Power Extraction is a fundamental challenge for an attractive fusion energy source. The scientific issues encountered in fusion power extraction are substantially different that other energy sources including fi ssion. Examples of these unique attributes include a) a very high surface heat flux and potentially high peaking factors, b) a complex volumetric heating source involving both plasma products (n eutrons, particle, and radiation) as well as nuclear reaction in the power extract ion components, c) strong impact of electromagnetic field (both stat ic and dynamic) on heat transf er, d) large temperature and stress gradients which can derive a mu ltitude of complex physical phenomena, e) compatibility with the fuel cycle (triti um production and extraction), f) complex geometry, and g) an evolving material prope rties (e.g., due to radiation effect). In addition the power extraction components are inherently coupled to plasma performance (e.g., plasma-material interaction on the firs t wall and divertor), as well as the power conversion cycle and safety. The fusion environment encountered by the power extraction components represents an uncharted scientific territory with extreme c onditions. Some of the scientific challenges associated with the power extraction in th e fusion environment are described below. a) Understanding thermo-fluid dynamics of plasma facing components of power extraction : About 1/5 of fusion power appears on the plasma facing components of power extraction and should be recovered efficiently. \"Traditional\" approaches to high-heat flux components are not applicable to fusion because of potentially high peaking factors, large particle fluxes, electromagnetic loads, evolving material pr operties (due to both neutrons and particles fluxes), and geometrical constraints. This requires developing new understanding of heat tr ansfer and fluid dynamics in regime s that have not been explored 64thoroughly before -- mainly through modifyi ng coolant flow profiles (turbulent or transition to turbulent flows, impinging jets, etc.) b) Understanding thermo-fluid dynamics in the blanket : Utilizing lithium-bearing, liquid metal alloys as the coolant have significant advantages in extracting nuclear heating as well as tritium breeding. Becau se these alloys are electric ally conducting, their thermo- fluid behavior is strongly affected by the el ectromagnetic field confining the plasmas or generated by the plasma itself. The flowing liquid metal will experience v X B forces magnetohydrodynamic effects) that are many times larger than viscous and inertial forces. These forces have a large impact on flow prof iles and heat transfer conditions. For fusion application, the science of liquid-metal MHD thermo-fluid dynamics should be extended to regimes with large variations in and grad ients of the v X B for ces, time-dependent EM fields generated by the plasma opera tion, and intense nuclear heating. c) Understanding the generation and transport of \"impurities.\" During the operation of the power extraction system, a large amount of \"impurities\" is generated. These include a) material implemented and/or diffused into the plasma facing co mponents of the power extraction components, b) material produced by chemical or physical interaction of constituents of power extraction components, c) material produced due to the interaction of neutrons with the constituents of power extraction components such as tritium and transmutation by-products. Understanding the generati on and transport of these \"impurities\" in the fusion environment and w ith large temperature and stress gradient represent major scientific challenges. d) Multi-physics phenomena. The fusion environment encountered by the power extraction components represents an unchart ed scientific terr itory with extreme conditions. Because of the combined environmental loading conditions and the interactions among the disparate physical elem ents and materials of the plasma chamber, it is expected that many multi-physics effects will be encountered. e) Understanding the life-limiting and failure mechanisms of power extraction components. Reliable operation of power extract ion components requires a detailed understanding of possible life-lim iting or failure mechanisms which does not exists. In addition to the extreme conditions of the fusi on environment, synergetic effects may play a major role in producing new life-limiting phenomena. Associated coupling and integration issues: Direct linkage with plasma facing com ponents, tritium fuel cycle, material, plasma operation, and safety issues. 652.b.13. Materials Science in the Fusion Environment: Understand the basic materials science phenomena for fusion breeding blanket s, structural components, and plasma diagnostics and heating components in high neutron fluence areas. The unique combination of intense high-energy neutron fluxes, high heat fluxes, tritium production, and high temperature coolants asso ciated with a fusion energy system poses immense challenges to conventional cons truction materials. New damage-resistant materials need to be developed for futu re fusion reactors, where harsh operating conditions will exist in terms of extrem e temperatures (interface with plasma temperatures >108 K), heat fluxes (>10 MW/m2 in fusion divertor regions, approaching the radiant flux at the sun surface) and high mechanical stresses. Furthermore, complete destruction of local atomic bonding will o ccur regularly within nanoscale neutron- induced displacement cascades in the materials surrounding the fusion plasma, resulting in hundreds to thousands of transient displacement events for every atom over the lifetime of the materials near the fusion first wall and blanket region. There are also complexities associated with changing chemistr y in the material due to neutron-induced transmutation events. Therefore, empirical-ba sed materials development, such as what was successfully used in the 1960s for the evolutionary design of fission reactors, is not a viable option for fusion energy (it is too tim e consuming and costly, with high probability of failure). New science-based methods incorporating improved cross-cutting fundamental knowledge of basic radiation damage mechanisms in mate rials are needed to guide the pathway to materials capable of su stained high performance operation in this extreme environment. Multiscale simulations of materials for fusion energy systems need to provide accurate and computationally efficient predictions of physical phenomena for spatial dimensions spanning ten orders of magnitude and temporal scales spanning more than twenty orders of magnitude. The current state of the art approach for multiscale materials modeling involves passing information between a series of specialized codes operating at different length and time scales. The \"coarse-graining\" that occurs as information is passed to computational codes at progressively larger le ngth and/or time scales necessarily involves approximations (data truncation) that can in troduce poorly quantifie d errors into the hybrid model predictions of materials be havior. A new theoretical and simulation paradigm for predicting and extrapolating materials perfor mance over vast length and time scales would transform the utility of predictive computational modeling for designing future fusion energy systems. Seven of the scientific challenges associated with materials in the fusion environment are described in the following. a. Investigate the constitutive mechanical pr operties of structural and breeding blanket (neutron multiplier, lithium-containing ceramic ) materials after short- to long-term thermal exposure and fusion DT neutron i rradiation (tensile, fracture toughness) including joints and dissimilar material transition regions. The intense neutron fluxes in the regions surrounding the plasma will damage the structural integrity of the solid materials, which could lead to prem ature failure of key components. 66 Status and Extrapolation: Th e current knowledge base for re duced-activation structural materials systems exposed to fusion-relevant neutron irradiations is nonexistent for displacement damage and transmutant helium levels above ~1 displacement per atom (dpa) and ~10 appm He, respectively, which is about two orders of magnitude below the projected Demo operation conditions. Multisca le models and experimental validation are needed to examine the impact of fusion -relevant helium-rich (~10 appm He/dpa) environments on neutron-irradiat ed structural materials, part icularly at damage levels above 10 dpa. Similarly, the mechanical beha vior of breeding blanket materials exposed to fusion-relevant neutron irradiation conditions needs to be determined so accurate models of radiation-enhanced pebble be d sintering and other phenomena can be developed. Acquisition of this improved understanding of deformation and fracture mechanisms may enable a quantum advance beyond the current high-strength, low-ductility/toughness paradigm for conventional st ructural materials (i.e., typically high strength is achieved at the expense of subs tantial reduction in ductility, and vice versa). b. Examine the dimensional stability and phase stability of model and prototypic structural and breeding material systems due to fission and fusion neutron irradiation. Engineering designs for fusion energy system s likely cannot tolerate more than a few percent dimensional change in the blanket structure. Furthermore, radiation-induced changes in the phases comprising the material may lead to chemical incompatibility with the flowing coolants or surrounding materials, or may cause degrad ation in mechanical properties. Status and Extrapolation: Current radiation da mage theory predicts that void swelling and dimensional growth due to irradiation creep will be strongly enhanced in a fusion- relevant helium-rich environment (~10 appm He/dpa) reactor neutron conditions (~0.1-0.5 appm He/dpa). Improved physical models and experimental validation are needed for fusion-relevant irradiations above 1-10 dpa, including experimental and modeling investigations of the performance (dimen sional stability) of new materials systems engineered at the na noscale for superior ra diation resistance. c. Establish the scientific basis for new high temperature structural design criteria. The US regulatory approval basis for structural materials in high temperature nuclear energy systems currently does not exist. Mechanical deformation mechanisms such as creep- fatigue and ratcheting are not well unde rstood from a fundamental perspective. Status and Extrapolation: The current me thod for determining the allowable safe operating conditions for structural materials at elevated temperat ures (non-irradiation environments) involves lengthy and costly expe rimental tests on multiple heats of a given material by multiple laboratories. The derive d empirical curves for properties such as simultaneous thermal creep and mechanical fa tigue conditions are only valid for one narrowly-defined chemical composition; any change in the composition of the allow requires another complete set of costly and time-consuming tests. The physical phenomena that control the mechanical behavior of structural materials at elevated temperatures need to be determined, including possible synergistic effects when multiple 67deformation processes (e.g., thermal creep and cyclic mechanical fatigue) are present. This will form the basis for formulating a science-based methodology for determining the safe operating conditions for materials at elev ated temperatures in both non-irradiation and neutron irradiation environments. d. Develop a quantitative predictive mode l for thermal conductiv ity degradation of neutron irradiated metals and ceramics, so that new materials can be designed to avoid large radiation-induced decreases in th ermal conductivity. Avoidance of large degradation in thermal conductivity is of particular importance for plasma facing materials and feedthrough insulators for plasma heating systems. Status and Extrapolation: Although it is we ll-known that neutron irradiation can cause reductions in the thermal conductivity in meta ls and ceramics due to creation of point defect clusters and small solute precipita tes that increase electron and phonon scattering, respectively, existing models do not have the ability to make accurate quantitative predictions of the thermal conductivity degradation. Deve lopment of a robust physical model for thermal conductivity degradation ma y lead to development of new nanoscale chemical formulations that would minimi ze this radiation-induced degradation. e. Discover the underlying physical mechanisms controlling the chemical dissolution rate of materials exposed to coolants, includi ng mass transfer phenomena associated with surrounding dissimilar solid materials. Status and Extrapolation: It is known that the chemical dissolution rate of materials exposed to a flowing coolant is controlled by a number of factors including the chemical solubility of the material in the coolant, the coolant flow rate (or more generally the chemical gradient profile in the coolant ne xt to the material), and the temperature gradient within the flowing loop system. However, a predictive unified theory for chemical dissolution in a flowing non-isot hermal coolant loop has not yet been established and dissolution rate data obtained by different labo ratories often vary by more than one order of magnitude due to lack of knowledge a bout which key experimental variables need to be controlled. Furthermore, potential effects of irradiation on enhancing or suppressing corrosion rates are unknown for the current list of proposed coolants for fusion energy systems. The roles of coolant velocity, viscosity, heat capacity, solubility behavior of the exposed material, and piping dimensions (laminar vs. turbulent flow and wall boundary effects) need to be determined in order to develop a predictive science- based corrosion model. The role of radiatio n (radiolysis and other mechanisms such as radiation induced segregation of surface layers or accelerated passivation) on corrosion mechanisms needs to be included in this model. f. Explore the mechanisms responsible for radiation-induced changes in electrical resistance and optical properties in dielectric materials, in particular the effect of ionizing radiation on radiati on-induced conductivity which is of importance for several plasma diagnostic systems. Status and Extrapolation: Early models for radiation indu ced conductivity (RIC) underpredicted the magnitude of the effect in ceramic insulators by several orders of 68magnitude. The current knowledge base on RI C is composed almost entirely of experimental observations and empirical correla tions. At the present time it is unknown if there are any practical chemical composition a nd processing modifications that could be made to mitigate the magnitude of RIC. Radiation induced degradation in the transparency of optical materials is also of concern for plasma diagnostic systems. Additional phenomena such as radiation i nduced electro-motive force (RIEMF) can create large unexplained spurious signals in plasma diagnostic instruments; an improved understanding of these effects is needed for the accurate operation of diagnostic components in a fusion neutron environment. g. Exploration of reduced-activation and reduced-decay-heat compositions that simultaneously provide high stru ctural material performance. Status and Extrapolation: Due to considera tion of safety (short term decay heat and volatization) and long-term e nvironmental (Class C shallow wa ste disposal) issues, only a handful of elements in the periodic table are suitable for construction of \"reduced- activation\" materials for DT fusion systems. Emerging computational thermodynamic tools and first principles modeling can provide guidance for the development of promising high-performance structural material s systems, but experimental validation of the long-term stability of these materials und er mechanical stress at high temperatures and fusion-relevant irradiation conditions is needed. These new \"materials by design\" compositions need to simultaneously satisf y waste volume and low activation disposal classification criteria, and id eally would include some material systems that potentially could be recycled for reuse in future-generation fusion energy systems. Associated coupling and integration issues Direct linkage with plasma facing co mponents, tritium fuel cycle and power extraction design issues Structure should remain intact followi ng all realistic off-normal conditions Maintain acceptably low tritium inventory during operation (materials with high hydrogen solubility are generally not allowed) 2.b.14. Safety: Demonstrate the safety and environm ental potential of fusion power: to preclude the technical need for a public evacuation plan, and to minimize the environmental burdens of radioactive waste, mixed waste, or chemically toxic waste for future generations. a. Computational tools are needed to analy ze the response of a fusion system to an off- normal event or accident. Extrapolation: The US Fusion Safety Progr am has developed a series of advanced system level (and in some cases component level) computational tools to analyze the response of a fusion system to an off normal event or accident. We have also developed the underlying database needed to characteri ze the fusion radiological source term that could be mobilized in these events. We con tinue to work with ITER and the French regulator to gain acceptance of these US tool s in the licensing of ITER. It would be an 69important precedent to have such tools ultim ately accepted for future licensing activities for fusion in the US. Key needs include the requirement for integrated off normal behavior testing to vali date the predictions of system be havior identified in the safety analysis. Verification and validation of such tools will be required by any regulator and properly designed and scaled experiments will be needed to provide the necessary validation data. This type of integral te sting can be expensive and needs to be incorporated into the respec tive technology development plan s. Development of system level safety analysis tools for Demo needs to continue. New models in the areas of tritium transport, dust and hydrogen explosions, and PbLi/water chemical reactivity need to be developed for present system level analysis codes. Development of coupled activation and 3-D neutronics codes that accurately pr edict the activation s ource terms and doses around the torus using the actual 3-D geometry is needed. Code development will continue in the fission industry and as new sy stem level safety codes become available these codes should be adapted to fusion to provide fusion with more up to date system level safety analysis tools. Also more fusion- specific sophisticated safety analysis codes are also needed in the area of magnet arcing. Progress in this area is presently being limited by availability of arcing data, electro magnetic model development, and available computing power. Progress is n eeded in this area given the high stored energies of a fusion reactor magnet system. Finally, all codes to be used for licensing will have to be validated and verified (V&V) to NRC requirements. b. Understanding and quantifying the fusion so urce term will be re quired for licensing activities. Extrapolation: In the area of source terms, the two with greatest uncertainty today are dust and tritium. In terms of dust the key uncertainties are the magnitude of dust generated in the machine, its location and the potential for explosive dust mixtures in the presence of hydrogen and air in certain accide nt sequences. We anticipate that we will learn much about the generation and distribu tion of dust from ITER, however the use of plasma facing materials other than those in ITER may affect the characteristics of the dust produced (quantity and size), and the clea nup methods that will have to be employed. For the high temperature breeding blankets anticipated in Demo key tritium issues include accountancy, control and permeation. With very tight normal operating releases for tritium releases to the environment (esp ecially liquid releases ) and the ability of tritium to permeate easily through high temperature materials, control of the tritium flows through the plasma chamber and the blanket, the associated cooling systems, and the power conversion systems will be a challenge. The tritium through-put in ITER will be relatively low compared with Demo, and experi ence with high through-put prior to Demo is desirable. Additionally, th ere is the potential for tritium to permeate to areas that were not designed for tritium retention, thus understanding tritium permeation is extremely important. R&D is needed (e.g., tritium permeation barriers\u2014it is important to point out that tritium barriers will be ha ve different under irradiation re lative to out-of-pile) to help better define and hopefully resolve the issue prior to Demo. c. Qualification of fusion components in the fu sion Demo environment will be required to validate the design and to demonstrat e safety roles of key components .. Extrapolation: Separate effects and integral irradiation testing in a fusion component test 70facility (CTF), fission reactors, particle accelerators could provide a portfolio of high damage (> 10 dpa) performance testing data for advanced fusion materials and the blanket and divertor components; combined w ith ITER results these data can make the licensing case to qualify Demo component s. Beyond safety and licensing concerns, testing and qualification activities are required for investment protec tion thus effort is needed by the relevant technology commun ities to develop coherent qualification strategies for the key components of Demo . These strategies must recognize the investment protection needs, reliability requirements, and safety aspects of the components. d. A waste management strategy for fusion must be developed. Extrapolation: Beyond the need to avoid th e production of high-leve l waste, there is a need to establish a more complete waste mana gement strategy that examines all the types of waste anticipated for Demo and the anticipated more restricted regulatory environment for disposal of radioactive material. Demo designs should consider recycle and reuse as much as possible. Development of suitabl e waste reduction recycling, and clearance strategies is required for the expected quanti ties of power plant relevant materials. Of particular concern over the longe r term could also be the need to detritiate some of the waste prior to disposal to prevent tritium from eventually reaching underground water sources. This may require special facilities for the large anticipated fusion components. The fission industry will be developing recycling techniques for the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is developing guidelines for the release of clear able materials from fission reactor wastes both of which may be of value to fusion. e. Experience with large scale remote handling will be important prior to Demo Extrapolation: Remote handling of large com ponents will be instrumental to the success of fusion. Activation levels in commercial pl ant will be much higher than in ITER, and ITER will have significant downtown relative to a commercial plant (and will not be under the same time constraints as a commerci al plant), thus additional experience with remote handling of large component s is desirable prior to Demo. Associated coupling and integration issues Safety and environmental issues are clearly cr oss-cutting, and this task must be closely coordinated with all the sc ience and technology issues. 2.b.15 Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Inspectability: Demonstrate the productive capacity of fusion power and validate economi c assumptions about plant operations by rivaling other electric al energy production technologies. a. Reliability of fusion-specific components is not known with accuracy. Extrapolation: Reliability is the proper opera tion of a component or system when called upon to perform. For an individual component, reliability is generally expressed in terms of a failure rate, which is the number of failure events occurring in a group of components within a fixed time period divided by the total operating time of the group of 71components. A typical failure rate might be expressed as 1E-06/operating hour. In developing technologies, traditiona lly the reliability data from a given level of technology is applied forward to the next incremental st ep in the technology. Fusion has a modest collaborative program in place to collect an d analyze existing tokamak (DIII-D and JET) and fusion facility component failure rates for use on future devices [2.b.15.1, 2.b.15.2]. The existing tokamaks under study only provide some of the data needed to extrapolate to ITER and beyond. Notably, superconducting magnets and actively cooled in-vessel components require further study. In the same 'step forward' pattern, our expectation is that ITER operating experience data will be rigorously collected and analyzed to generate failure rates to be used on Demo. Ar eas not well addressed by ITER operating experience will require component testing si milar to the SNL high heat flux component testing that has been pursued for a variet y of designs since the 1980's [2.b.15.3]. b. Availability of a Demo plant is not known and little effort has been given to this area. Extrapolation: Availability of a system or an entire power plant is a measure of its operating hours over a calendar year. Plant ava ilability is calculate d as the sum of its actual operating time pe riods in a year divided by the ca lendar hours in a year. Looking at current fusion experiments, many are lim ited by allocated funding to some number of weeks of operation in a year. Therefore, existing tokamak e xperiments track availability as actual operating hours divided by scheduled operating hours. Most experiments in the world attain more than 60% of scheduled availability and some are at 80-90% [2.b.15.4]. However, attaining even 90% availability out of a funded ~20-25 operating weeks/year (at 10 hours/day and 5 days a w eek, with pulse lengths measur ed in seconds) is early in the path to energy source development. The existing \"Generation II\" fleet of US nuclear fission power plants, that have component redundancy and many multi-train systems in their designs, have been increasing their av erage annual availability from the 60% range in the 1970's to the 90% range in the mid- 2000's [2.b.15.5] with good performing plants achieving over 93% (that is, less than 25 outage days per year). Given the proven operations of nuclear fission components, de sign simplifications, design margins, and lessons learned from the present fleet of reactors, the AP600/AP1000 \"Generation III\" advanced fission power plants are expected to exceed 93% annual plant availability [2.b.15.6]. The Electric Power Research In stitute published a requirements document for advanced fission reactors that calls for 87% availability over the plant's 60-year lifetime [2.b.15.7]. Therefore, a fusi on power plant must also have high availability. Granted, new technologies exhibit an availability growth during the first years of operation [2.b.15.8], but the inherent ability to operate for thousands of hours pe r year must exist in the plant components for the technology to be competitive. Past availability studies for fusion used judgment data [2.b.15.9, 2.b.15. 10]. With more work in component testing and reliability analyses, better estimates of fusion plant availability can be made and areas for improvement identified. c. Maintainability of a Demo plant is not well defined. Extrapolation: Maintainability is a measure of the calendar hours time duration needed to repair a component or system and restore it to operation. The time to repair a component 72or system and return it to service should be as short as possible to keep the plant availability value high. There are two as pects of maintainability, maintenance work performed by humans and r obotic/remote maintenance. Fusion power plants will incorporate several individually unique tec hnologies in one si te, namely: cryogenic production plant, balance-of-plant systems for electricity producti on, high technology vacuum plant, state-of-the-art gas purification systems, a small gaseous fuel storage plant, scientific systems having more in common with particle accelerators than fission reactor power plants, and a highly diverse in-plant el ectrical distribution system - thus the need for a large maintenance staff trained to work on this wide variety of technologies. If there are redundant subsystems in each of the main plant systems to increase plant availability, maintainability needs are eased by these subsystems that allow repair while the overall system continues to operate. Ho wever, additional subsystems increase plant size and capital cost, as well as preventive maintenance time and cost. A fusion power plant will also have remote maintenance inside the tokamak. There are costs associated with the unique remote handling equipment for precision placement of multi-ton modules, spares of the remote handli ng equipment, rescue equipment if the primary equipment fails in-vessel, a full scale mock-up facility of some portion of the vacuum vessel for operators to practice jobs so that repairs are safe and efficient (reducing repair time to minimum levels for high availability), shie lding casks to mate with the tokamak to transfer high radioactivity parts to a hot cell or waste disposal area, and the cask transfer system. All of the remote handling equipmen t also requires its own maintenance. With current designs for tokamak and stella rator reactors requiring periodic and time- consuming replacement of divertor compone nts, fusion downtime would be high. Presently a fusion power plant cannot compete with high availability fission plants. Life-time or long-lived in-vessel components are needed so that fusion downtime is short, making fusion more competitive with fission. d. Inspectability of a Demo plant is not well defined. Extrapolation: Inspectability is the ability to visit a component or otherwise perform visual or other detailed examinations of a component and determine its status. Keeping the inspection time duration brief promotes high plant availability . In the fission industry, inspectability has two facets: 'testing' genera lly refers to active components (pumps, fans, circuit breakers, safety circuits, computers, etc.) and 'inspection' generally refers to passive components (tanks, heat exchangers, pi pes). All of these tests are mandatory, for example the periodic surveillance tests of sa fety-related components that are defined in the fission plant's Technical Specifications as part of the plant's li censing basis. Other mandatory inspections are cited in the Am erican Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPV C), which must be used for fission power plants (as directed in federal regulati ons, 10CFR50.55a). The ASME in-service inspection of welds, piping and vessels identifies cracks, material flaws, and wall thinning. Inspections ty pically use visual examination and radiography during fabrication, then visual examination and ultr asonic or dye penetran t techniques during the component's service life to monitor health and remaining lifetime. For example, The single-walled TFTR vessel was stress tested to Section III class 2 of the ASME BPVC, 73and all welds were 100% volumetrically inspected during fabrication according to Section IX of the code [2.b.15.11]. After TFTR operation began the vessel welds were helium leak-tested for vacuum integrity, but they were not ultrasoni c tested each 10 years as specified in the ASME BPVC. Consider ing that ITER has a double-walled vessel and due to ITER's size it has hundreds of meters of coolant piping in guard pipes, it is clear that fusion must develop, and defend to re gulators, good methods to test large vacuum vessels, cryostats, and shrouded piping to demonstrate integrity during off-normal events. Appropriate testing methods for in-vessel wa ll modules must also be developed beyond video inspection. In general, systems must be made safe for test and inspection, the downtime must be brief or it will detract from plant availability. Efficient techniques are needed for inspectability. Some fission power plants have adopted a combined reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) and \"condition monitoring\" approach to good advantage [2.b.15.12], this may be very useful for fusion as well. The ITER project is taking reliability, avai lability, maintainability, very seriously. Th e ITER RAM-support (RAMSUP) task does not want experimental objectives compromised by poor re liability or maintainability, which sets a positive goal for ITER and a positive precedent for future fusion activities. RAMI concepts are straightforward, and, as eviden ced from the NET analyses [2.b.15.9], they apply directly to fusion. Reliable plants are productive plants; the fission industry has proven that the value gained by increa sed operation time outweighs the cost of redundancy and plant maintenance. Adopting a strong RAMI progra m also offers less tangible benefits: more reliable, well-cared-for facilities tend to produce more and higher quality data, and they tend to be safe r for both personnel and the public. Associated coupling and integration issues RAMI is included in all plant systems and equi pment, it is clearly cross-cutting as seen by the discussions of reliability included in most sections of this report. Application of RAMI in fusion is not clearly defined at pres ent; past experiment and ITER experiences will provide guidance in this issue for Demo. References [2.b.15.1] L. C. Cadwallader and T.

While not defining precisely what was meant by the term, it is clear that what was wanted was guidance on which areas would benefit most from additional emphasis or investment. As the pa nel developed the list of issues, it was clear that none were unimportant and that all would ha ve to be resolved eventually. Thus it is crucial for readers to understa nd that the panel's judgments on priorities should not be taken as a recommendation to abandon certain broad lines of research. Rather, they are meant to inform decisions concerning which areas to stress now. In almost all research areas, some level of ongoing core competen cy is required for a coherent program. 2.c.1. Approach The task of prioritization was approached by first defining a set of criteria, scoring and weights. These were based enti rely on issues related to char ge 1; assessment of gaps and U.S. opportunities were evaluated separately. Three criteria were developed and defined as follows: Importance: Importance for the fusion energy mission and the degree of extrapolation from the current state of knowledge 1. Resolution would lead to improvement in end product, moderate extrapolation from current and planned experiments 2. Resolution would lead to improvemen t in end product, major extrapolation from current and planned experiments 3. Problem must be solved, moderate extrapolation from current and planned experiments 4. Problem must be solved, major ex trapolation from current and planned experiments Urgency: Based on level of activity requi red now and in the near future. 1. Only low levels of activity are requir ed now, significant work could begin in 15 years to meet 35 year plan schedule (i.e . waiting on ITER results is acceptable) 2. Only low levels of activity are required now, but significant new activities must begin in 10-15 years to meet 35 year plan schedule 3. Ongoing work must continue at a m oderate level and/or be increased or augmented by significant new activities in 5-10 years to meet 35 year plan schedule 4. Work must continue at a high level or significant new work must begin in the next 5 years to meet 35 year plan schedule Generality: Degree to which resolution of the issu e would be generic across different designs or approaches for Demo. 1. Solutions to this issue are narrow and unlikely to be appli cable to range of likely Demo instantiations 762. Solutions to this issue are narrow but li kely to be applicable to range of likely Demo instantiations 3. Solutions to this issue are generally applicable The relative weighting for the three criter ia was roughly 3:2:1 respectively (though results were not terribly sensitive to this we ighting). Each panel member evaluated each of the 14 issues against these three criteria. The votes were then averaged and the results circulated for further discussion. This pro cedure was repeated three times as we refined the criteria and definitions of the issues to resolve ambiguities and discrepancies. Note that issue 15, which involves crosscutting a nd overarching questions was not included in the prioritization process. 2.c.2 Discussion of Priorities After considerable discussion, a consensus was reached on the relative priorities of the first 14 of the broad technical issues previous ly identified. These were then grouped into three tiers, the tiers defined to suggest an overall judgment on the state of knowledge, the relative requirement and timeliness for more intense research for each issue. Tier 1: solution not in hand, major extrapola tion from current state of knowledge, need for qualitative improvements and substantial development for both short and long term Plasma Facing Components Materials Tier 2: solutions foreseen but not yet achieved, major extrapolation from current state of knowledge, need for qualitative improvements and substantial development for long term Off -normal events Fuel cycle Plasma-wall interactions Integrated, high performance burning plasmas Power extraction Theory and Predictive modeling Measurement Tier 3: solutions foreseen but not yet ac hieved, moderate extrapolation from current state of knowledge, need for quantitative improvements and substantial development for long term RF launchers and other internal components Plasma modification by auxiliary systems Control Safety and environment Magnets 772.d U.S. Strengths and Opportunities Separately from priorities of issues, the pa nel evaluated U.S. strengths and opportunities to contribute in each of the 14 areas which ha d been prioritized. While it was clear that we want to avoid duplication of internati onal efforts in making these evaluations and recommendations, the panel felt that the U. S. shouldn't shy away from competing where we have the abilities to make strong contribu tions. We separately evaluated the U.S. position with respect to four questions. 1. What were areas of current and historical U.S. strength or leadership? 2. In what areas was the U.S. in greatest danger of losing leadership or competitiveness given current trends? 3. What were areas where the U.S. had an opportunity to sustain l eadership by strategic investment ? 4. In what areas could the U.S. gain leadership by making significant new investments? (At the same time we note again the need to maintain a level of core competency in all re levant areas as these underpin current and future programs.) The results of our deliberation: 1. Areas where the U.S. has leadership Measurement Theory and Predictive modeling Control Further areas were the U.S. is strongly competitive Plasma-wall interactions Integrated, sustained, high-performance plasmas Safety/environment 2. Areas where the U.S. is in part icular danger of losing leadership or competitiveness given current trends and international investments. Measurement Control Antennas and launchers Materials Integrated, sustained, high-performance plasmas Plasma-wall interactions and Plasma facing components Safety/environment Magnets 3. Areas where the U.S. has opportunities to sustain leadership through strategic investment Measurement Theory and Predictive modeling Control Plasma-wall interactions 4. Areas where the U.S. has opportunitie s to gain leadership through significant investment Plasma facing components Materials 78 79 Chapter 3 Assessment of Available Means To Address Issues To answer the second part of the charge, th e panel was required to review current and existing programs and assess their capabilit ies to address the key issues we had previously identified. The inventory was car ried out using published literature, project documents and contacts with key personnel. For each facility or program, we summarized the mission and objectives, technical capabilities, plans and schedules. Evaluation of existing programs was more stra ightforward as their basic capabilities are known and their plans well documented. The capabilities for plan ned facilities are literally and figurative less concrete and a gr eater degree of interp retation and judgment was required. This was particularly true for assessing the long-term program for ITER, beyond the baseline Q=10, ELMy H-mode mission. In this case, we have to consider both the capabilities of the facility and the l ong term interests and priorities of the ITER partners. 3.a. ITER ITER is a collaboration among seven parties (Europe, Japan, USA, China, South Korea, Russia and India) to build the world's first reactor scale fusion device located in Cadarache, France. The ITER Project expect s to finish major cons truction in 2016 ITER is presently scheduled to begin DT fusion experiments in 2020, and to operate for 20 years. Mission and Objectives The overall programmatic objective of ITER is \"to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy fo r peaceful purposes.\"[3.a.1]. This is be achieved in baseline ITER H-mode opera tion by producing a nominal 500 million watts of fusion power in 300-500 second inductively driven pulses. These burning plasmas are expected to be dominantly self-heated by the fusion alpha particles with an energy gain Q (the ratio of fusion power produced to extern al power applied to heat and control the plasma) of ten. These plasmas will begin to explore the nonlinear coupling of a self- heated fusion plasma to the plasma transport, MHD stability, and plasma edge interaction with the boundary - a key integration of scie ntific issues. The dur ation of the baseline operating mode is sufficient to achieve stationa ry conditions for energy transport, particle, impurity and alpha ash and heat remo val in the divertor. Since helium particles (alpha particles) are created by the fusion re actions, the determination of impurity levels will be more complex in fusion plasmas. Engineering ITER will test the physics and technologies of particle and energy exhaust under conditions relevant to the design of 80Demo. The high fusion power and plasma temp erature in ITER also enables the alpha particle pressure to be a signi ficant fraction of the total plas ma pressure, a key factor in enabling study of the new physics to be e xplored in a burning plasma. The design does not preclude the possibility of controlled igni tion (or higher gain) for short durations if enhanced confinement is attained. Secondary technical objectives of ITER [3.a.1] are: 1. Demonstrate steady-state operation using non-inductive current drive with the ratio of fusion power to input power for current drive of at least 5. This could be accomplished with additional investments to allow modestly-advanced operation with confinement enhanced by 30% relative to H- mode operation and normalized N increased by 50% to 3. This configuration is expected to produce a self-driven plasma current of f bs 50%, and would require a non-inductive plasma current drive system capable of producing 4.5MA with the desired profile. Fusion powers of 350 MW could be sustained for ~ 3000 s limited by the capability of the superconducting coils and cryogenic system to remove the heat produced by neutron heating. 2. Demonstrate availability and integration of technologies essential for a fusion reactor; ITER is close to the physical scale exp ected for a Demo/fusion reactor, and will demonstrate the integration of superc onducting magnets with an energy producing tokamak environment. Steady-state plasma fueling and heat removal technology will be demonstrated on ITER at power densities within a factor of ~4 of those needed for Demo. ITER will also provide a major test of tritium handling technologies including development of low tritium retention plasma facing components and rapid tritium reprocessing systems. The reactor scale vacuum vessel and remote handling systems will be a major step toward the technology needed for Demo. The operation of these engineering systems over the planned 20-year operational period will also provide a convincing demonstration of the safety benefits of fusion. 3. Test tritium breeding module concepts with a 14MeV neutron power load on the first wall 0.5MWm -2 and fluence 0.3MWam-2 that would lead in a fu ture reactor to tritium self- sufficiency, extraction of high grade heat , and electricity production. This could be achieved with additional investments to f und a Test Blanket Module (TBM) program to construct and test up to three TBMs simultaneously in mid-plane ports. The ITER superconducting coil set 81Basic Parameters for ITER ITER will be the first fusion device built with a scale similar to a fusion power plant. The physical size and strength of the magnetic fi eld for ITER plasma is comparable to a Demonstration (Demo) fusion power plant. ITER is intentiona lly designed to be somewhat larger than a power plant Demo pl asma to provide a performance margin since some of the advanced science and technology features needed for a Demo are not yet fully validated on existing facilities. Key para meters for ITER are listed in Table 1. Table 3.1. ITER Parameters and Operational Capabilities.

Operational Scenarios and Expected parameters The base line operating mode of ITER is the inductive H-Mode, which will satisfy the overall programmatic purpose of ITER and provide access to the burning plasma physics regime. The physics basis for H-Mode opera tion is strong in terms of fundamental understanding and empirical extrapolation fro m existing experiments. The hybrid scenario has improved confinement, increased beta and reduced requirements for inductive current drive relative to the H-Mode. This will allow longer duration inductively driven discharges to study th e physics and power handl ing capabilities for plasma durations ~1,000s. The steady-state discharges would be facilitated by 50% 82self-driven current with the remaining 50% of the plasma current driven by external non- inductive current drive such as neutral beam s, ECCD, FWCD or LHCD . This operational mode will be relevant to steady-state operati on in a Demo, and will provide capability for nuclear testing of test blanket modules.

Negative ion based deuterium neutral beams at an energy of 1 MeV are under development for central heating. Up to 33 MW of NB power will be injected using two beamlines with the 83potential for a third beam line. Ion cycl otron frequency RF at frequencies of 40-50 MHz will be coupled using two mid-plane launchers integrated with port plug shield assemblies. During startup operation, 20MW of EC will be used either in two upper ports to control neoclassical tearing modes, or in one equatorial port for main heating or current drive. EC will allow use of four allocated top po rts for the power upgrade. No additional equatorial ports are therefore forese en for this system. A lower hybrid system at 5GHz and powers up to 40 MW will be used for off-axis current drive required for advanced scenarios.

Note: the total maximum power into the torus is limited to 110 MW. First Wall and Divertor Capabilities ITER will extend our knowledge of particle and power handing in a fusion plasma in terms of power handling, pulse duration, power density, off-normal events, reactor relevant materials and technology. The lower single null divert or consists of 54 remotely maintainable cassettes mounted on the floor of the vacuum vessel. The divertor entrance and dome are tungsten and the vertical targ ets will be either carbon or tungsten with choice to be made at the time of procurement. The first wall consists of 10 mm Be armor on a water cooled Cu substrate. The divertor and first wall are designed for power densities of ~ 0.5 MWm -2 on the first wall and 5 - 10 MWm-2 on the divertor targets under steady-state conditions. The nominal di stribution of the plasma heating power (150 MW) is: core radiation 30-50 MW, man tle radiation 30-60 MW. The most significant challenges have to due with the large transient heat loads due to ELMs, major plasma disruptions and disruption mitigation. Particle handling under fusion plasma cond itions will be a major accomplishment of ITER. The PFCs and divertor must pump th e D,T, He ash exhaust efficiently while providing very low retention of tritium in side the vacuum vessel and pumping system. Retention fractions of ~0.025% are needed in a power plant while TFTR and JET achieved ~ 40% in DT operation. 84Key Issues To Be Addressed By ITER a. Predictable high-performance steady-state burning plasma: ITER will enable major advances in our state of knowledge to ac curately predict and then create high- performance steady-state burning plasmas. Th e baseline operation of ITER will provide key tests of our understanding of plasma c onfinement, MHD stabili ty, energetic alpha particle behavior and edge plasma interactions with the first wall in a plasma relevant to fusion energy production. The operation of ITER in modestly-advanced modes will extend our understanding toward the regimes needed for a fusion Demo. However, the ability of ITER to explore Demo-like advan ced modes is limited due to constraints from nuclear heating of the TF superconductor. b. Boundary - Plasma Material Interface: A major result of ITER will be to extend our understanding of the boundary-plasma material in terface in a fusion plasma environment. This will include a detailed understanding of the edge DT plasma, control of the wall interaction including tritium retention (with a cold first wall), as well as the development of materials and robust components that ar e appropriate for off- normal events in a neutron environment. c. Off-Normal Events: ITER is a major step beyond existing de vices in terms of energy/m 2 deposited on plasma facing components by ELMs and major disruptions, and will provide a large increase in our understa nding and ability to avoid, control and mitigate ELMs and disruptions. d. Harnessing Fusion Power: The plasma e xhaust processing systems of ITER will be required to operate at conditions approaching those required of a Demo system. A Test Blanket Module Program including high temperat ure modules could provide initial data under low levels of neutron irradiation and therefore validate some aspects of design codes for breeding blanket modules on a Demo . However, materials used for ITER structural components and first wall component s would not be suitable for a fusion Demo. Schedule The present ITER plan is to begin ITER construction by the end of 2007 with project completion and first plasma to occur in early 2016. After several years of operation with H and then D, ITER would begin DT experiments in approximately 2020 with the baseline H-Mode capability (Q = 10, 500 MW for 400s) achieved in 2022, and 100% non-inductive current drive capability in 2023 [3 .a.2]. The ITER In ternational Project Organization (IPO) is currently reviewing th e design of ITER and any modifications are to be determined by the end of 2008. [3.a.1] Progress in the ITER Physics Basis - Chapter 1: Overview and Summary, Nucl. Fusion, 47 (2007) S1-S17. [3.a.2] ITER Web Site, http://www.it Confinement Experiments 3.b.1. ASDEX-Upgrade Mission/Program ASDEX-Upgrade (AUG) is a mid-sized divert or tokamak located at the Max-Planck- Institut f\u00fcr Plasmaphysik (IPP) in Garchi ng, Germany. The primary mission for the machine has been support for the ITER design and operation, with focus on integrated, high-performance scenarios, the plasma boundar y and first wall issues. The machine is similar in many respects to DIII-D, however , to be prototypical for ITER and other reactors, the machine was designed with a spar se set of shaping coil s outside the toroidal field coils. This feature imposes limits the amount of shaping which can be achieved. Concepts for divertor geometry and PFC materials have been tested as part of an intensive research pr ogram into divertor and boundary plasma physics. Plasma wall interactions are studied at high-power and in high-performance discharges investiga ting power loading to first wall components, control of impurities and helium transport and exhaust. Discharges have been developed which can dissipate most of their input power via edge impurity radiation. AUG is currently testing t ungsten as a first wall material via thin coatings over the older graphite tiles (with thicker coatings over the divertor strike points). Coverage is now up to about 85% of the vessel. Levels of tungsten in the plasma have increased, but are generally at acceptable levels - though overcoating with boron is required for some operational scenarios. Generation of impurities during RF heating has been a particular concern with the high Z first wall. Reduction of carbon concentration in the plas ma (which is less th an the reduction in graphite tile area) and carbon migration have also been st udied. An extensive set of diagnostics is employed to test models of th e divertor and plasma edge including parallel transport, radiation, atomic physics and neutral recycling. AUG has a broad program for the study of MHD stability and limits. Emphasis has been on active control of sawteeth and neoc lassical tearing modes (NTM) via localized ECH and ECCD. In some cases the depositio n width has been artificially broadened to simulate the situation on ITER where the ma rginal island size will be proportionally smaller than on current devices. Plans incl ude real-time feedback on the NTM position and ECCD deposition location. A second importa nt area of MHD resear ch is the study of large scale magnetic perturbations and their inte raction with fast particles provided by the ICRF and NBI systems. Both high-frequenc y (e.g. TAE) and low frequency (e.g. NTM) Photograph of a plasma in ASDEX-Upgrade 86MHD modes have been investigated. ASDEX is also equipped to measure the heating from localized fast particle loss. Research is carried out to classify, predict and mitigate disruptions. A database has been developed which attempts to classify every disc harge termination. Neural nets as well as more traditional approaches have been take n to predicting various classes of disruption and using these predictions to trigger fast puffs of impurity gases for mitigation. Transient heat loads from disruptions a nd ELMs have been characterized by infra-red imaging of the divertor and first wall. ELM loss energy and localized heating has been studied for various regimes and techniques for re ducing these heat loads have been tested. ELM pacing with repetitive small pellets has shown some promise and may be employed on ITER. Regimes which have only sma ll ELMs have also been investigated. Basic studies of transport a nd turbulence have tested mode ls for ITG and TEM in steady state and transient plasmas. ECH has been successfully employed to provide localized time dependent heating and validated models for \"stiff\" electron temperature profiles via the flux/gradient response. The predicted stability threshold for TEM onset was also tested in these experiments. Particle transport, especially at low collisionality, has been studied and led to predictions of moderately peaked profiles for ITER. AUG contributes actively to the international database for the prediction of confinement on ITER. Research on edge transport ba rriers (H-modes) have included studies of the structure and scaling of the pedestal, the underlying physic s of the H-mode density limit, physics and transport properties of ELMs and the connection between e dge and core parameters. Considerable effort has gone into understand ing the edge operating space especially the appearance of different ELM types. Investigations into the physics of internal transport barriers (ITBs) have stressed the creation and triggering of barriers; sustainment via in ternal pressure gradients and localized current drive. Scenario modeling and development of steady-state regimes has included the hybrid mode, with weak shear, and advanced modes w ith reversed shear. The hybrid studies have emphasized prediction and extrapolation to ITER, while the AT studies are at a more basic level, emphasi zing operational ranges, beta limits and NTM control. Current drive tools include NBI, ECCE and ICRF fast waves.

Significan t upgrades are planned fo r the ECCD system. An additional 4 MW will be can be adjusted to 105/117/127/140 GHz on a shot to shot basis. A new set of steering mirrors will be installed which would allow feedback control of the poloidal launchi ng angle during a pulse. Taken together, these will allow greater operational flexibility for NTM stabiliz ation. A new pellet injector for elm pacing, capable of operating at 150 Hz is also planned. Looking farther ahead, there are plans to insta ll a resistive shell for passive stabilization of resistive wall modes along with a set of 24 actively driven coils. These would be used for control of external kink modes in revers ed shear scenarios in experiments in the 2009/2010 time frame. Capabilities for exte rnal current drive will be improved. The methods available on AUG today, NBI and ECCD are limited in either spatial localization, efficiency for off-axis drive or overall power available. A lower hybrid system is being considered for installation by 2010.

C-Mod Mission/Program Alcator C-Mod, located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA, is a compact, high-field tokamak with metal plasma-facing components (PFC) and RF systems for heating and current drive. There are three basic components to the machines mission: 1) support the ITER inductive H-mode baseline scenario; 2) advanced high bootstrap fraction in quasi-steady st ate; 3) conduct research into the underlying topical science areas of transport, plasma boundary, wave-particle interactions and macrostability. Since C-Mod can operate at the same toroidal field and plasma density as ITER and with similar ICRF and LH frequencies, the plasma Alcator C-Mod Tokama k 88dielectric properties are nearly identical, ma king these experiments pa rticularly relevant. The AT experiments feature equilibrated cu rrent profiles, heating and current drive systems without associated momentum or particle sources and equilibrated ion and electrons. The unique dimensional paramete rs broaden inter-machine comparisons and comparisons between theory, simulations and experiments. Lined with over 7,000 molybdenum tiles, C-Mod is currently the only divertor tokamak operating with all metal PFCs. A set of tungs ten divertor tiles, with an ITER-like design, has been recently installed and increased use of tungsten in the future is under consideration. Plasma wall interactions a nd retention of hydroge nic species in metal PFCs is an active area of research as are studies of erosion, deposition and dust generation. Power and particle fluxes are similar to those expected on ITER, though with much shorter discharge lengths. Because of its high-density operation, C-Mod runs with higher neutral and photon opacity, enabling stud ies of neutral visc osity and radiation transfer in regimes that approach those expected for ITER. A recently installed cryopump should allow operation over a wider ra nge of collisionalities and increase the overlap with lower-field devices. C-Mod has a broad program in turbulence an d transport including studies of energy, particle and momentum transport channels. In vestigations of self-generated rotation and momentum transport are motivated by the need to predict plasma rotation in future reactors with low or zero external torque and low *. Similarly, particle transport experiments are part of a coordinated intern ational program aimed at predicting density profiles at low collisionality and suggest th at ITER could expect moderately peaked density profiles even in the absence of a co re particle source. The LHCD will enable direct manipulation of steady- state magnetic shear on C-Mod and allow tests of drift- wave simulations which predict a significa nt dependence on this parameter. High-k fluctuation diagnostics will be employed to look for the origins of electron energy transport. Studies of H-mode threshold empha size local physics, especially the role of SOL flows and SOL/edge coupling. As noted above, the unique dimensional regime of C-Mod, in combination with other machines enables investigation into H-mode pedestal scaling over a wide range of parameters and allows evaluation of role of plasma physics (scaling like n ea2) and atomic processes (scaling like n ea). Characterization, prediction and mitigation of disruptions is an area of focus in the MHD area. Early experiments have shown promising results in ra diating a substantial fraction of discharge energy, decreasing the current quench time and reducing halo currents following a disruption. Experiments into mode locking thresholds are carried out in coordination with other devices in order to predict the maximum error field allowable for ITER, which will be critical during the low-de nsity start-up phase of each discharge. Studies of intermediate n Alfvenic Eigenmodes are carried out using a set of active MHD coils which can characterize growth rates for stable and unstable modes. Research into H- mode pedestal stability has emphasized small and no-ELM regimes and comparisons with peeling-ballooning models. 89With only RF systems for heating and cu rrent drive, the C-Mod program makes substantial efforts to understand the physics a nd technology of these systems, aiming to increase their launched power density and overall effectiveness. These efforts include an active program to model and characterize I CRF antennas and LH launching structures. Currently under test are fast ferrite tuners which will allow real-time matching for the ICRF systems. Another area of research is the generation of impurities enhanced by RF sheaths which is particularly critical in me tal walled machines - The current ITER first wall design has tungsten tiles connected, along ma gnetic field lines, directly to its ICRF antenna. The LH systems are designed for the efficient off-axis current drive needed for the AT program, motivating extensive studies of wave coupling and spectrum optimization. In collaboration with the RF Sc iDAC group, there is a significant effort to validate RF models by detailed measurements of RF waves in the plasma, modification of the particle distribution func tions and local perturbations of temperature and current profiles.

DIII-D DIII-D is a medium sized tokamak located at General Atomics in La Jolla, Ca. Mission: To establish the scientific basis for the optimization of the tokamak approach to fusion energy production. The DIII-D Program is an integrated science program aimed at an energy goal. The three main program elements and objectives are 1. ITER support: Enable the success of ITER by providing physics solution to key issues. 902. Advanced Tokamak: Establish the physics basis for steady-state high performance operation for ITER and beyond. 3. Science: Play a lead role in advancing funda mental understanding of fusion plasmas on a broad front. In order to effectively meet the objectiv es of these program elements, the DIII-D experimental effort is organi zed into five research areas: Steady-State Integration - The long-range goal is inductive and non-inductive advanced tokamak ( N>4) operational scenarios, including not only core plasma scenario development, but also integration of solutions for handling the heat and particle fluxes at the boundary, operational control and machine protection techniques, and credible start-up and normal shutdown scenarios for these high-performance discharges. Research on these topics will benefit from planned upgrades to the ECH, NBI, and FW systems that will increase total heating power to 30MW, enabling higher N and Te/Ti, while improving overall current profile control capability. Improve d feedback control-coil systems, off-axis NBI, and extended TF pulse lengths will provide additi onal flexibility to extend and optimize advanced scenarios. ITER Physics -The operating flexibility of DIII-D allows it to address a broad range of scientific and technical issues of direct relevance to ITER construction and operation, and to do so in a timely and efficient manner in conjunction with ot her fusion research tokamaks. This research is a critical part of preparation for the operation of ITER. The issues selected for emphasis in 2007-2009 in clude: 1) Suppression and control of edge localized modes (ELMs) resonant mode control using feedback control coils and taking advantage of rotation control with co /counter neutral beam injection; 3) NTM control using modulated and steady-state ECCD; 4) Disruption characterization and mitigation using massive gas puffing; 5) Tritium inventory control studies using surface analysis, 13C injection, DiMES, and surface conditioning (e.g. oxygen bake). Over the longer term, we expect to shift emphasis to preparing for ITER operation. Fusion Science - This research area conducts experiments to understand the underlying physical processes governing five topical areas. In the Boundary area, research addresses radial heat transport, limits to energy dissi pation by radiation and other processes, the physics of surface erosion and impurity migration, edge fl ows, and the stability and transport of the edge pedestal. Energetic part icle research seeks to understand the role of Alfv\u00e9n eigenmodes on fast-ion trans port and the role of fast ions in sawtooth stability. In The DIII-D Tokamak 91the heating and current drive area, the emphasi s is on developing the scientific basis for comprehensive models for NBCD, ECCD, and FWCD, with a near-t erm focus on fast-ion coupling effects and understanding bootstrap current in the edge pedestal region. Stability research is focused on understandi ng error-field effects (correction and plasma screening) using co/counte r NBI to vary plasma rotation. Transport research is facilitated by a comprehensive set of turbulence diagnos tics with a focus on understanding intrinsic rotation and high-k turbulence, seeki ng to understand electron transport.

Integrated Modeling - Research here is directed towards validating theoretical models through experimental tests to enable implemen tation of interpretive and predictive codes for DIII-D and other tokamaks. This require s effective data analysis tools for both experiment and simulation (e.g. synthetic di agnostics). The GYRO transport code is compared directly with experiments, but is expensive to run, thus motivating development and implementation of the TG LF transport model. The NIMROD 3D resistive MHD code is simulating ELM cont rol by resonant magnetic perturbations and 92gas-puff disruption mitigation. ELM contro l and pedestal stability experiments are examined using the ELITE code, while the BOUT code is being compared against edge turbulence measurements. Finally, the UE DGE, DIVIMP, and OEDGE codes are being compared against scrape-off-layer and divertor data to better und erstand particle and energy flows in the plasma boundary. Plasma Control and Operations - Work in this area is directed towards development of plasma control tools for DIII-D and other to kamaks to enable reliable high performance operation for fusion research. Activities follow an integrated approach to control design: producing validated plasma response mode ls, developing design simulation tools, controller designs, and testing integrated cont rol solutions for plasma shape, position, stability, and internal plasma profiles (e.g. current, pressure, and rotation). As much as possible, these control designs are derive d from physics-based models in order to maximize transferability of solutions to ITER and other next-generation devices. Research in this area also s upports the development and use of specialized versions of the DIII-D Plasma Control System (PCS) at devices under construction and in operation worldwide, including KSTAR, EAST, NSTX, MAST, and PEGASUS. Capabilities and Upgrade Schedule: The table below shows present and planned major device capability for the DIII-D facility. The DIII-D program is now prepar ing a new Five Year Program Plan for FY 2009-20013. Major upgrades are planned for th e ECH system (increased heating power and fast steering), the Fast Wave system (improved high power l ong pulse antennas), and the neutral beams (longer pulses and capabili ty for 10MW of off-axis injection. Improvements to coil systems will increase full-field TF pulse lengths to 10s and further reduce error fields. We plan to expand the se t of internal coils (and improve their power supplies) for ELM-control and RWM research. Expansion of the diagnostics capability will continue across many areas.

Its mission is to investigate the physics and technology in support of ITER and steady-state advanced tokamak concepts. Shaped hydrogen/deuterium plasmas with both single-null and double-null divertor configurations will be possible. The device features all superconducting magnets, actively cooled plasma facing The EAST Tokamak 93components, flexible shaping capability, an d good access for changing the plasma facing components and other internal structures. The heating an d current drive systems are expected to provide flexible current and pres sure profile control. The program has a large emphasis on developing steady-state diagnostics which not only protect device operation but also provide a broad range of measurem ents in support of th e long-pulse physics mission. The EAST mission in support of ITER will empha size plasma control. Strategies will be developed for equilibrium, shape, and positi on control in an all-super-conducting magnet environment. Fast-response internal feedback co ils will be available to develop real-time, long-term control. A flexible set of heating and current drive system s will permit current profile control. Experiments on disruption mitigation by gas and/or pellet injection experiments are planned. A high performa nce hybrid mode (par tial inductive current drive) at full toroidal field and current can be sustained for 30 s. Physics goals include high performance H-mode operation, and divert or optimization (e.g., developing divertor concepts compatible with high triangularity and high beta, testing various plasma facing components and active cooling, and developing long-term particle exhaust). Expected plasma parameters include T e>5keV and n e>5\u00d71019. The EAST mission in support of advanced tokamak concepts will highlight the long- pulse device capability and momentum-f ree heating sources. A full non-inductive scenario with high beta N>4 and bootstrap fraction appro aching 90% is possible at Ip=0.5 MA for 60 s pulses. Somewhat lower N>3 shorter pulse plasmas are possible at higher I p. Divertor optimization for the advanced tokamak will be emphasized, as well as development and testing of advanced plasma facing comp onents and wall conditioning techniques.

A two phase operation schedule is planned. During the first phase 2007-2009, the field and current will be increased to 3.5 T and 1 MA. A substantial fraction of the eventual heating and current drive power will be available. The full heating and current driv e will be available in the second phase 2010- 2011. An internal cryo-pump will also be ava ilable to enable extending the pulse length 10-100 s. There is also a plan for 5 MW of neutral beam injecti on late in the second 94phase. Beyond the second phase, smaller majo r plasmas R=1.7 m are planned to reduce the impact of toroidal field ripple. References [3.b.4.1] J.

FTU Mission/Program FTU is a compact high-field limiter tokamak w ith circular cross se ction located at the Centro Ricerche Energia in Frascati, Italy. It tends to run at higher density (and collisionality) than most other machines in the world program. As a result electrons and ions tend to be equilibrated in most operating regimes. Pellet injection has been applied to extend operation to higher densities. Auxiliary heating is by RF, with power available in the ion cyclotron, lowe r hybrid and electron cyclotr on ranges of frequency. The aim of the lower hybrid current drive program is to extend the range of this technique to higher densities. High efficien cy has been obtained at densities approaching 10 20/m3. Parametric decay and other parasitic losses were apparently not a problem, though one notes that coupling issues are likely to be different when comparing limiter L-mode results to that with divertor H-modes. Tests have been conducted to qualify a possible ITER design for a LHCD launche r - the Passive-Active Multijunction (PAM). This approach, while producing a less favorable wavenumber spectrum, should allow space for active cooling and neutron shielding that would be required on ITER, CTF or Demo. ECRF has been used for localized heating, pr oduction of internal tr ansport barriers and studies of electron thermal transport. Intern al barriers to electron transport have been produced by strong electron heat ing, especially during the curre nt rise phase. In these cases, the barrier can be sustained by appli cation of off-axis LHCD. These experiments are carried out without a central particle or momentum source. Ion Bernstein Waves (IBW) have been used fo r ion heating studies and for exploration of RF flow drive. So far some improvement in energy confinement has been observed. The Frascati Tokamak Upgrade 95 Cutaway drawing of the HSX stellarator. This work has not been definitive, but the te chnique offers an opportunity for control of the pressure profile by di rect intervention in the turbulence dynamics. FTU has begun tests of liquid wall concepts by installing a capillary fed lithium limiter. Thermal loads and sputtering raise the surf ace temperature and generate a significant quantity of gaseous lithium which subsequen tly coats the vessel walls. The resultant plasmas are somewhat cleaner, have higher SO L temperatures and can operate at higher density with peaked density profiles. Overall, the dynamics of this coating are similar to other wall conditioning and coating techniques . The applicability to continuous operation are not clear, however these experiments are an important demonstration of the use of lithium in a high performance tokamak.

Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) The Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) [3.b.6.1] is a moderate size (R = 1 m, a = 0.12 m, B = 1 T) stellarator device at the University of Wisconsin that began operating in 1999. It is the first (and presently only operatin g) stellarator built with a quasi-symmetric magnetic configuration; in th e case of HSX, the 96direction of quasi-symmetry is helical. HSX ha s four field periods, which with the helical quasi-symmetry give the machine a square appearance. The low-shear rotational transform profile can be varied above and below unity, and the degree of quasi-symmetry, the magnetic well, and helical ripple profiles can be adjusted by varying the ratio of currents in the several different types of modu lar and planar (toroidal field) coils. At present, the plasma is heated for ~ 50 ms by 100 kW of ECH at 28 GHz, which at B = 1 T yields plasmas with central electron temp eratures ~ 2 keV and ion temperatures 100 eV at densities 3-4 \u00d7 10 18 m-3. Work is in progress to add another gyrotron to increase the heating power to 200-300 kW. In the longer term, electron Bernstein wave and ion- cyclotron heating will be used to operate at higher densit y and heat ions. The HSX experimental program concentrates on fundamental studies of the role of quasi- symmetry in determining plasma flows, partic le/energy transport, and fluctuations and turbulence. The flexibility of the configuration\u2014 in which quasi-symmetry can be switched on and off\u2014plays a crucial role in the research. Noteworthy results from HSX include the first demonstrations that qua si-symmetry greatly reduces flow damping [3.b.6.2] and cross-field thermal diffusivity [3.b.6.3]. Work is in progress to measure electric fields (using beam emission spectro scopy and heavy-ion beam probing) as well as core and edge turbulence and correlate th ese with local transport in quasi-symmetric and non-symmetric configurations.

JET (EU) The Joint European Torus which is under the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA), is located at the Culham Science Centre, in Abingdon, United Kingdom. It is the largest tokamak currently in operation in the world. It has as its primary mission element the support of the ITER program. The summary presented here was taken largely from [3.b.7.1]. The JET device has replaced the divertor to permit high triangularity operation. This enables making plasmas very like the planned ITER boundary shape. In addition, a plan is in place to replace the inner wall and divertor materials to mimic the phase 1 ITER wall/divertor (Beryllium first wall, Tungsten and Carbon di vertor) and planned phase 2 wall/divertor (Beryllium first wall, all Tungsten divertor). JET plans to investigate tritium retention with these ne w wall/divertor systems and to test in-situ The JET device 97detritiaton systems as well as the issues associated with mixed Be-W layers. JET also plans to upgrade the maximum available NBI heating power to 34 MW for 20s (currently 25MW 10s), with a long pulse (40s) capability of 17MW (total heating power 25MW). A new ITER-like ICRH antenna will also be in stalled with 10s capability. The long pulse heating capability will be used to investigate scenarios si milar to the Q=5 steady state scenario envisioned for ITER. A high frequenc y pellet injector (60Hz) will be installed for ELM pacing studies as a follow on to similar studies on the ASDEX-U device. The injector has unlimited number of pellets (continuous screw feed). Diagnostic enhancements for determining the effectiv eness of the pacing are also planned.

Pamela, et al., \"The J ET Programme in Support of tokamak proposed to replace the JT-60U device at Naka, Japan. It will operate only with hydrogen and deuterium. There are two main mission elements: (1) support and extension of ITER-like operating scenarios and (2) development of steady-state, non- inductive operating regimes at high beta N=3.5-5.5. Pulse lengths of 100 s at full 41 MW auxiliary power and 8 hr at reduced power are specified. The construction of JT-60SA will be under the \"Broader Approach\" agreement between Japan and the European Union. JT60-SA 98The device is designed to produce ITER-shaped plasmas at about one-half scale. Flexible heating and current drive system s will permit a variety of ex periments in support of ITER. The combination of negative-ion neutral b eam heating and ECRH will permit plasmas with dominant electron heating having a signi ficant energetic particle population. Equal amounts (4 MW each) of co- and counter-tangential positive ion neutral beam heating will enable plasma rotation control. A large amount (16 MW) of perpendicular injection neutral beam heating will allow plasma pr essure control without large current or momentum drive, which enables simulation of burn control in ITER. The total heating power of 41 MW will also permit accessing H- mode at high density. The divertor heat load and particle fluxes will also be close to ITER values. The device is also designed to explore high beta, fully non-inductive configurations beyond ITER capability by enhancing flexibility in the aspect ratio and plasma shape. The upper and lower divertors will be designe d differently to permit forming both high and low triangularity single-null divertor configurations. Double-null divertor configurations are also possible. Str ongly shaped, lower aspect ratio A=2.6 configurations with high beta limits are de signed to investigate advanced non-inductive scenarios with bootstrap current fraction up to 0. 7. Passive stabilizing plates and active feedback coils are planned to control n=1, 2 resistive wall modes. The shaping and auxiliary heating systems are being designed to permit a range of current profiles with positive to negative magnetic shear.

KSTAR Mission/Program KSTAR is a new, recently commissioned superconducting magnet tokamak at Daejeon, Korea. It will operate with hydrogen and de uterium. The main research objective of KSTAR is to demonstrate steady-state high-performance advanced tokamak scenarios. The device has flexible shaping capability with a complement of heating and current drive tools that will permit study of a wide range of scenarios in both single and double null divertor configurations. The development of advanced scenarios will progress in steps, which are described in detail in the schedule and plans section below. KSTAR has significant capability for ITER-re levant physics and engineering research, summarized in Table 1. Optimization of IT ER operating scenarios, MHD control, and plasma-wall interaction are of interest in ITER-like plasma configurations, exploiting the in-vessel control coil system and KSTAR' s long-pulse capability. For engineering, KSTAR employs ITER-like magnet coils using Nb3Sn superconductor. Thus, KSTAR can be utilized as a test bed for developing and maintaining ITER-like magnets, examining issues such as AC loss and que nch characteristics of Nb3Sn superconducting coils. KSTAR is also going to implement ITER-like heating and current drive systems, such as 170 GHz EC and 5 GHz LH systems to provide an operational knowledge base prior to ITER. KSTAR will operate as an inte rnational fusion collaboratory, which will provide practical experience for the methods that will need to be employed for ITER. The total number of pulses at full pulse length in highest performance operation will likely be limited by neutron activation from D-D and daughter D-T reactions.

The initial operation phase (2008-2012) will establish the basic operation of a superconducting tokamak through the Ohmic, L-, and H-mode plasma experiments in the relatively short pulse-length regime of a fe w tens of seconds. Plasma facing components, such as limiter, divertor, and passive plates will be installed fo r the double-null D-shape plasma formation. In-vessel control coil system will be also installed for multi-purpose plasma control of plasma position, field errors, ELM, resistive wall mode, etc. The second phase (2013-2017) will concentrate mainly on developing the steady-state operation of a superconducting tokamak at relatively low power (~10MW) and low beta ( N ~ 2-3) regime. Experiments in standard H- mode and Hybrid mode will be carried out to increase the pulse length from a few tens to 100-300 sec utilizing non-inductive current drive systems. The development and optimization of long-pulse capability for the divertor system (e.g., particle and impurity control) and of real-time MHD control (ELM, NTM modes etc.) will pursue in parallel. Utilizati on of KSTAR as an ITER pilot-device for the test and optimization of ITER-relevant physics and engineering issues will be emphasized during this period. Table 1.

Large Helical Device (LHD) LHD [3.b.10.1] is a large (R = 3.9 m, a = 0.6 m, B = 3 T) supe rconducting stellarator device that began ope rating in 1998 at the National Institute of Fusion Science, Toki, Japan. Its magnetic configuration is referred to as either a heliotron or a torsatron, and consists of l = 2 helical windings carrying current in one direc tion with 10 field periods around the torus, plus an array of poloidal field coils which cancel the net vertical field of the unidirectional helical winding currents and also provide poloidal field shaping and variation of the rotational transform (= 1/q, where q is the safety factor). Its rotational transform profile is adjustable in detail, typically with (0) 0.2-0.7 102and (a) 1.5-1.6, somewhat similar to a reversed tokamak q profile. It is heated with 18 MW of tangential neutral beam heatin g (negative ions, 150-180 4 (positive 1 MW of ECH and 3 MW of ICRF. The field structure provides a natural helical divertor which can be exploited with appropriate baffling and pumps. Perturbation coils in each period can be used to induce/adjust magnetic islands to control the di vertor configuration in detail. The results of LHD experiment s so far are [3.b.10.2-4]: Stable confinement of plasmas with volume averaged values 4.8% for times ~ 1.5 sec ~ 10 energy confinement times. =4% has been maintained for >40 energy confinement times.

Planned upgrades for the near term (2009-2012) include: Increase of NBI heating power to 32 MW (18MW perpendicular +14MW tangential) for 3 s pulses. Increase of ICRF heating pow er to 3 MW (steady-state). Installation of complete, activ ely-cooled helical divertor.

N. et 'Proof of to explore and understand 3D quasi- axisymmetric (QA) shaping to address the plasma physic s challenges of enhanced performance steady-state operation without di sruptions [3.b.11.1]. NCSX uses 3D shaping to enhance MHD stability without requ iring external current drive or feedback systems, producing high-beta plasmas that have the potential to be free of disruptions. 103Due to the quasi-axisymmetry of the 3D shaping, with low remnant effective ripple, the plasma transport properties in NCSX are predic ted to be similar to equivalent tokamaks. Thus, NCSX seeks to combine the established features of stellarators (robust stability without feedback control, no disruptions, st eady-state without external current-drive, higher density limit) with the excellent trans port of tokamaks and of compact size similar to tokamak reactors. The NCSX mission is to provide the experi mental basis needed to understand and assess the use of 3D QA shaping for controlling high-be ta toroidal plasma confinement, and in particular for providing solutions to the physics issues that stand between ITER and DEMO. NCSX will investigate the full breadth of issues for 3D QA shaped plasmas, including limits and limiting mechanisms, disruptivity, turbulence and confinement, rotation and damping, magnetic surface structure, MHD and fast-ion instabilities, and divertor solutions. This research will be used to test, improve, and ultimately verify theoretical and computational models of plasma confinement with 3D QA shaping, and to develop a common understanding with tokamaks, incorporating the *-scaling and burning-plasma understanding from ITER. This understanding will enable assessment of the use of 3D QA shaping for DEMO, including the shaping needed for high disruption-free operation compatible with steady state sustainment of the magne tic configuration. The significance of 3D QA shaping for fusion energy was recently validated by the ARIES-CS study[3.b.11.2], which proj ected that a reactor based on a NCSX-like plasma could produce an attractive reactor. The improved understanding from NCSX could lead to a reactor similar to ARIES-CS, or to simpler configurations along the c ontinuum between NCSX and the advanced tokamak. The NCSX design builds upon the experimental and theoreti cal understanding of plasma transport and stability from both tokamaks and stellarators, producing a unique set of capabilities. The design was extensively analyzed to ensure that the goals were robustly achieved, were accessible, and that the design had flexibility to explore parametric variations in the theoretically key parameters. The NCSX physics design characteristics include (simultaneously): Very good quasi-axisymmetry (low residual ripple), such that the ripple-driven neoclassical thermal transport is negligible 3.b.11. [3] and fast ions are confined. This is calculated to gi ve tokamak-like zonal flow s for turbulence suppression [3.b.11.4] and low rotation damping. Passive stability at = 4.1% to all MHD instabilities that limit beta in tokamaks, kink, Stellarator 104without the need for feedback stabilizati on, driven rotation, or nearby conducting walls [3.b.11.5]. The MHD stability thre shold can be raised above beta=6.5% by adjusting coil currents. Passive disruption stability, in that the magnetic equilibrium is maintained even with a total loss of beta or plasma current. 'Reversed shear', i.e. q decreasing or rotational transform increasing across the plasma. This enhances MHD stability, suppresses islands and tearing modes, stabilizes trapped particle instabilities, and reduces turbulent growth rates [3.b.11.6].The ITG/TEM linear growth rate decreases with increasing beta. In tokamaks, this produces self-s tabilization of turbulence and neoclassical ion, particle, and momentum transport. 75% of the edge magnetic rotational tran sform is produced by the coils, 25% by the bootstrap current at = 4.1%, with no externally driven plasma current (thus compatible with steady state). This is a substantially lower boot strap current than advanced tokamaks, significantly reducing the non-linear influence of beta on the equilibrium. Very good flux surface quality for high [3.b.11.7],vacuum, and intermediate , with less than 3% of the flux lost to islands at =4%. Expanded boundary divertor-like edge ge ometry, independent of the edge rotational transform, due to the strong pl asma shaping [3.b.11.8]. The full vacuum system is bakeable to 350C. Aspect ratio of 4.4, chosen to be sim ilar to the ARIES-RS tokamak design, and significantly lower than W-7X and LHD. Comparisons across the transport optimized stellarators will pr ovide information to understand the effect of aspect ratio on stellarator confinement. = 4.1% was chosen as the design goal because it is substantially above the predicted no-wall stability limit for advanced tokamaks with high bootstrap-current fractions (such as ARIES-RS and ARIES-AT). A stable access path from startup to high-beta has been simulated [3.b.11.9], and the current profile wa s calculated to be stable to tearing modes [3.b.11.10]. NCSX has been designed as a flexible experi ment, allowing a wide variation of the 3D plasma shape and magnetic configuration charac teristics by varying the nine external coil currents [3.b.11.11]. This will enable controlled experiments challenging and validating our understanding. For example, The degree of QA or effective ripple can be continuously varied at least a factor of 30. The coil-produced magnetic ro tational transform and shear The MHD kink stability threshold can be reduced down to ~1% at either constant rotational transform or constant edge shear. This flexibility is obtained using auxiliary coil sets that can be eliminated to simplify future energy systems. The magnetic field strength can be varied up to 2 T, giving access to higher temperature, lower collisionality plasmas. With 6MW of heating, ion temperatures above 4 keV and i*~ 0.04 are predicted. This enables experimental study of the confinement scaling with 105normalized gyroradius ( *) separated from the collisionality ( *) and scalings, for comparison with theoretical transport models and projections to futu re devices. This should also allow NCSX to overlap the dime nsionless parameter regimes of middle-scale tokamaks. This capability is important fo r testing the connection between NCSX and tokamak transport understanding. NCSX Parameters & Capabilities B T = 1.2 - 2. T R = 1.42 m, a = 0.32 m = 1.8, = 1.

NCSX can accommodate up to 12 MW of external hea ting (NBI, ECH, ICRF) [3.b.11.12] and a comprehensive set of plasma diagnostics. The early experiments will emphasize neutral beam heating to provide access to high beta. The heating systems will be refurbished and reused from previous experiments. The dia gnostics and heating systems will be installed and upgraded throughout the evolution of the research program. [3.b.11.1] H. Neilson et al , in Fusion Energy (2007) [3.b.11.4] H.E.

RFPs The Reversed Field Pinch (RFP) configurati on explores toroidal magnetic confinement with small external magnetization. In partic ular the applied toroidal magnetic field is nearly absent, typically ten times smaller than the poloidal magnetic field. The main fusion development challenges for the RFP are (1) to maximize improved confinement, (2) to demonstrate stabilization of multiple , simultaneously occurring resistive wall modes, (3) to develop current sustainment consistent with good confinement in steady- state or for an attractive pulsed scenario, an d (4) to develop plasma-boundary control that would permit realizing a compact, high power-d ensity fusion system. High beta values required for a compact fusion power core have been demonstrated experimentally, but the limits to beta have not been identified. The understanding and physics performance of the RFP is much improved from that of five to ten years ago. Inductive current profile control is used to reduce tearing instability, thereby increasing confinement to a level co mparable to a same-size, same-current tokamak. New RF current drive tools are under development to maximize and to sustain current profile control. This research will provide new information on RF physics relevant to stability and confinemen t in toroidal systems generally. Mitigation of resistive wall modes is generically one of the most important fusion challenges in high beta toroid al confinement. Active cont rol of many resistive wall modes has been demonstrated robustly in R FP plasmas with low rotation, an important result for toroidal confinement. Continue d optimization of the control algorithms and tools is a major thrust in RFP research. The capabilities and fusion science program emphases for the main RFP experiments are summarized below: the MST facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the RFX facility in Padua, Italy, and the Extrap-T2R facility at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. There are in addition several smaller RFP devices operating at Japanese universities. RFP science also has str ong connections to astrophysics, not described here. The MST facility (UW-Madison) The MST program is the centerpiece of the US proof-of-principle RFP program. It is focused primarily on improving RFP confinement through current profile control, and on identifying limits to beta. A novel steady-state inductive cu rrent drive scenario (AC helicity injection) is also being tested. Inductive current profile control has demonstrated a (transient) ten-fold confinement improvement by greatly reducing tearing instability. Further optimization of the inductive loop voltage programming remains high priority. In The MST Reversed Field Pinch 107addition, two RF current drive techniques are in development to facilitate more precise radial positioning of the auxiliary current drive and for longer duration, based on the lower-hybrid and electron Bernstein waves. These systems will also add significant non-Ohmic heating power, capability only recen tly appearing in RFP research. A 1 MW neutral beam is also planned, to assist a ssessing beta limit physics and to investigate energetic ion confinement. Th e MST device contains a thick conducting shell, so resistive wall modes are not easily accessible. The MST lower hybrid experiment is one of two in the US, the other on Alcator C-Mod (MIT). The principal aim is current drive target ed to the outer region of plasma for profile control (tearing stability). Wave accessibility in the high beta RFP necessitates high parallel index of refraction for the launche d wave. Strong, single-pass absorption is expected. A 200 kW, 800 MHz system is opera ting, and investigations of the wave propagation and absorption have begun. The cu rrent drive impact on MHD stability will be relevant to conventional and neo-classica l tearing mode stabilization. A multi-antenna, 1-2 MW system will likely be required in the future. The electron Bernstein wave is being studied in addition to lower-hybrid (LH) to assess the trade-offs of wave-launching and absorption. The EBW is of interest to any high beta configuration where accessibility of cyclotron waves is cutoff. The antenna fo r EBW is more straightforward than for LH, but the coupling physics is not well establishe d. This is a high interest research area worldwide, with collectively modest current drive and heating results to date. A 4-wave- guide system operating at 200 kW is presently in development. The MST program also emphasizes novel diagnostic development. Some highlights are magnetic field measurements by Faraday rotati on and the motional Stark effect (utilizing the full Stark manifold), high frequency cap able Thomson scattering based on novel high rep-rate lasers, novel techniques and spec troscopic analysis fo r charge exchange recombination (CHERS) impurity ion temperat ure and flow, and Rutherford scattering measurements of the majority ion temper ature and flow (plasma momentum). Both equilibrium and fluctuation measurement capability are emphasized. Several of these developments are impacting the directi on of diagnostic implementation on ITER. MST features: major radius, R=1.5 m; minor radius, a=0.5 m, plasma current, Ip=0.6 MA; pulse length, 0.1 s, thick metal she ll, lower hybrid and electron Bernstein RF systems in development (each 0.2 MW at present), 1 MW neutral beam injection planned, programmable control of the poloidal loop voltage under construction. The RFX facility (Italy) The world's highest power RFP facility is RFX-Mod, with a designed plasma current capability of 2 MA. The plasma is surrounde d by a metal shell with a vertical field penetration time of 50 ms. The centerpiece of a recent facility upgrade is a 192 coil system which fully covers the 2D toroidal surface for active and broadband MHD control. Each of these coils is independently driven. The feedback control system has demonstrated simultaneous control of more than 10 resistive wall modes, an important achievement with broad implications for high beta toroidal confinement. Control is achieved with little or no plasma rotation, so direct feedback of the modes is clearly 108demonstrated. The program is rapidly progre ssing in studies of optimized feedback scenarios, for example projecting radially inward the control surface for the normal component of magnetic field to minimize pl asma-surface interaction, and understanding side-band interactions that result in a ny control system with finite number coils. Employing robust control will be an important element in attaining high current in RFX, to control severe plasma-wall interaction consequent from unmitigated resistive wall modes. A new paradigm for an RFP in a relaxed state having a single helical mode and no magnetic stochasticity has been discovered in MHD computation, providing another path for improved confinement (alternate to current profile control). The flexible active control system on RFX can isolate the control of a single Fourier mode to hopefully stimulate the production of a single-helicity state. This state has helicial symmetry, resembling a stellarator in some respects. Observa tions of quasi-single- helicity conditions in all RFP plasmas, where one mode becomes much larger to create a helical island structure with hotter plasma inside, bolsters this path. The RFX facility also employs flexible i nductive programming for both the toroidal and poloidal loop voltages. The sustainment of R FP plasmas is a relatively difficult challenge, given that pressure-driven curr ents are small. Optimization of inductive current drive, for either steady-state or attractive pulsed scenar ios requires such flex ible power control. Building on this power engineering expertise, the RFX program will host the test facility for ITER's negative-ion-based neutral beam sources. RFX features: major radius, R=2.0 m; minor radius, a=0.46 m, plasma current, Ip=1.2 MA (2 MA designed capability), pulse length, 0.4 s, resistiv e shell wall time, 0.05 s, 192 saddle-coil active control system, programmable control of both the poloidal and toroidal loop voltages, 1 MW neutral beam heating planned. The Extrap-T2R facility (Sweden) The RFP community enjoys two complementary facilities with research emphasis on active MHD control. The Extrap-T2R is smalle r than RFX, but it similarly employs a full coverage active feedback coil system totali ng 128 coils and independent power supplies. The vertical field penetration time of the resi stive shell surrounding th e plasma is 6.3 ms. Active control of all resistive wall modes has been demonstrat ed for pulse lengths up to 0.1 s, limited by the loop voltage power suppl ies, not by consequences from the residual resistive wall mode spectrum. This corres ponds to active control up to 15 wall-times, with no indication of long-pulse control issues. The RFX Reversed Field Pinch 109Most high beta magnetic configurations exhi bit a variety of MHD behavior, and coupling between types of instabilities could be a da nger. The Extrap-T2R active control program aims to elucidate the linear and nonlinea r physics associated with mode-sideband coupling in the control system. One practical goal is to understand what determines the minimum required number of control coils. A large part of this study is optimizing the magnetic sensors, e.g., comparing field co mponents or combinations of components. Sensitivity to and mitigation of non-ideal eff ects in the signal processing will also be investigated, e.g., signal noi se and coil misalignment. Wall locking of the usually rotating resonant tearing modes is an important issue that remains not completely understood. The versat ile capability of the active control system permits pre-programmed action on a single mode, thereby adjusting the drag force created by the mode. Understand ing the physics that determines the locking threshold and its parameter dependence will be a primary goal. The internal surfaces in contact with the pl asma are all-metal in Extrap-T2R, primarily molybdenum limiters. The heat loads on these lim iters is fairly large, typically about 2 MW/m 2. Spatially resolved spectroscopic measurement will be used to investigate the influx and accumulation of metal impurities, and surface collector probes will be used to investigate impurity accumulation. The data will be compared with models for a heat pulse on the limiter surface. Extrap-T2R features: major radius, R=1.24 m; minor radius, a=0.18 m, plasma current, Ip=0.3 MA, pulse length, 0.1 s, resistive shell wall time, 0.0063 s, 128 saddle-coil active control system, all-metal plasma facing surfaces. 3.b.13. Spherical Tokamaks World research on the Spherical Torus (ST) is dominated by the two mega-ampere class devices currently in operation, 1) the Nati onal Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) at PPPL in States and 2) the Me ga-Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) at Culham Science Centre in the United Kingdom. These devices are focused on developing the ST as a potential component test facility and fusion reactor. In addition, these devices contribute to the knowledge base of toroidal confinement physics by expanding the range of parameters in the international databases. US STs NSTX - The most powerful ST facility in th e world with state-of-the-art diagnostic systems, addressing the full range of scientif ic topics, including ST-specific integration issues. Mission - To provide the physics basis for future ST based devices, such as a high heat flux first wall material testing device, ST-CTF and ST-Demo, to broaden the physics basis for ITER while actively participating in ITPA and US BPO, and to advance the understanding of toroidal magnetic confinement. 110Integrated steady state operation - NSTX has already achie ved very long pulse ( pulse >> current redistribution time) at N ~ Nwith_wall . For future scenario development, the primary target scenario for NSTX is ba sed on the requirements for proposed future steady-state low aspect ratio devices such as NHTX and the ST-CTF. In particular, to demonstrate steady state operation at norma lized plasma pressures at or above the requirements for these devices. In particul ar upgraded NBI inj ection capability will enable the study of off-axis NBI current drive as a tool for maintaining 100% non- inductive sustained operation. In addition, non-resonant magnetic braking in concert with the strong unidirectional momentum injection from NBI will be used to control the rotation profile. Investigation into the effectiveness of EBW as a heating and current drive tool is beginning and will determine whether this tool will be viable for current profile control on future devices. Extended TF pulse length will enable the study of low-collisionality plasmas with good NBI confinement. Plasma control development, done in co llaboration with DIII- D is a major focus of the integration group. Plasma control developments will include the incorporation of the ne utral beam injection into the control system. Additional diagnostic measurements will also be obtained in real-time including: motional Stark-effect polarimetry for current profile control, charge exchange recombination spectroscopy for rotation profile control, and Thomson scattering for equilibrium reconstruction constraint. A liquid lithium divertor plate will be investigated as a means for heat and particle flux control. NSTX is capable of operating at very peak high heat flux, similar to ITER. ITER support - NSTX is leveraging its large acce ssible operating space to elucidate a number of physics issues that are crucial to ITER success. In particular, NSTX can achieve and exceed the ratio of fa st particle pressure to total pressure that ITER will have while simultaneously matching or exceeding the ratio of vfast/vAflv\u00e9n for ITER while measuring the current profile and the fast par ticle density profile and edge losses. This enables the study of overlapping fast particle modes, the so-called \"sea of Alfv\u00e9n waves\", which is anticipated to be pr esent on ITER. In addition, NSTX can achieve peak heat fluxes that match that expected for ITER. ELM studies, undertaken und er the auspices of ITPA joint experiments with DIII-D and C-Mod, have elucidated the issues for access to small ELM regimes, which may be crucial to ITER success. NSTX is also investigating the effect of RMPs on ELM stability, helping to elucidate the physics behind this important control tool. The physics of surface waves, which were found to be important when coupling HHFW to NSTX plasmas, is an important area where NSTX can help ITER. Cross-section of the NSTX device showing major device components. 111Toroidal confinement physics - Because NSTX operates in a unique regime, it is able to access important plasma physics that has tr aditionally been difficult to access in conventional aspect ratio experiments. As an example, a high-k scattering system which was recently commissioned on NSTX, is illumi nating and quantifying the fluctuation spectrum that is believed to be responsible for anomalous electron transport in tokamaks. NSTX operates with a large normalized electr on gyro-radius, enabling this measurement. NSTX is investigating the physics of non-axis ymmetric control including such varied topics as RWM feedback, error field contro l, non-resonant rotation damping, resonant field amplification, tearing mode locking to error fields, and ELM suppression. By doing these experiments in a complementary parameter space (high- , low-A) NSTX can provide critical insight into the physics of non-axisymmetric effects. Facility Development Plan - The table below illust rates the planned faci lity upgrades that will support the broad scientific goals for NSTX. Major improvements include an additional 7MW NBI, 1MW of EBW/ECH, liq uid lithium divertor, TF the pulse length, and upgrad ed non-axisymmetric coil capability. Table showing the NSTX facility upgrade plan (from \"NSTX 5 year plan\") HIT-II - Developed CHI to start the plasma non-inductively; Applied on NSTX. PEGASUS - the lowest aspect ratio device (R/a ~ 1.1) to explore the benefit of this regime including very high beta operations. Also investigating an innovative start-up technique based on plasma guns which can be also applied to NSTX. 112LTX (CDX-U) - the lowest particle recycling (~ 30%), and improved confinement with liquid lithium based approach . To be applied on NSTX. International STs MAST , Culham, UK - A mega-ampere class ST with many complementary features to NSTX. MAST has a large vacuum vessel but no stabilizing plates, excellent set of profile and boundary diagnos tics. MAST has 5MW NBI and EBW heating. Confinement, H-mode, and boundary physics. MAST uses as innovative start-up technique utilizing internal poloidal field co ils called induction-merg ing startup. MAST has as a major mission element the s upport of ITER by studying ELM physics and divertor physics. GLOBUS-M , Ioffe Physico, RF - Medium size ST with R/a = 1.5, Ip ~ 300 kA.

SST-1 Mission/Program SST-1 is a new long pulse, superconducting to kamak being commissioned at the Institute for Plasma Research, Gandhinagar, India. It will produce elongated, double-null divertor hydrogen plasmas. Both the toroidal and poloidal field magnets are superconducting, while the Ohmic transformer is normal conducting. 113Key physics issues to be addressed in SST-1 are energy, impurity, and part icle confinement in long pulses up to 1000 s, particle and heat removal up to 1 MW/m 2 during these long pulses, and long term stability of shaped plasmas in high beta advanced tokamak regimes, including resistive wall mode control. The facility includes a variety of auxiliary heating and current drive systems, including ICRH, ECRH, NBI and lower hybrid current drive. Although these represent a total heating and current drive power of 4 MW, a maximum 1 MW total steady-state (long pulse) input power is accommodated by the plasma facing component heat removal system. The combination of LHCD and bootstrap current ar e anticipated to provide at least 0.1 MA in long pulse. SST-1 Parameters & Capabilities B = 3.0 T I P = 0.22 MA R = 1.1 m a = 0.2 m = 1.7-1.9 = 0.4-0.7 P ICRH 1 10-80 keV Pulse duration 1000 s Schedule/Plans The fabrication of SST-1 has been comple ted and commissioning is underway. A first phase operation is planned that begins with circular plas mas and evolves to full power operation in diverted configurations. Later in the first phase, circular plasmas with LHCD assist and elongated plasmas with LHCD only will be investigated . A second phase is planned to explore advanced tokamak configurations. References [3.b.14.1] Y.C. Saxena et al, FT/2-1, 21st IAEA Fusion 2006. The SST-1 Tokamak TEXTOR Mission/Program (IEF) in Julich, Germany, is a mid-sized limiter tokamak with a circular cross-section. Its research program is oriented toward the issues of plasma wall interactions and plasma facing components (PFC) in support of ITER and W7X. This includes the study of particle and energy exchange between th e plasma and first wall and vacuum vessel as well as active measures to control the edge plasma and to reduce heat loads, particle release and impurity influx to tolerable levels. TEXTOR is designed with good access for edge diagnostics, facilities to heat the vacuum vessel and liner and provisions to replace the liner as necessary. A series of upgrades added a number of auxiliary heating systems, a toroidal pumped limiter and most recently a coils to produce a dynamically controllable ergodic divertor . Other aspects of the facility are also optimized for study of plasma wall interactions. An air-lock system allows for the fast exchange of sample PFCs. The ability to heat the limiter and first wall to 1600 C allows investigations into the temperature dependen ce of plasma interactions. The machine has an extensive diagnostic set for studying the edge plasma and wall. A major element of the program is the development and validation of numerical models for the plasma edge and plasma wall interact ions. Important questi ons addressed include the identification and characterization of erosion and redeposition mechanisms in fusion-relevant first wall materials (C, Be, W); investigation of tritium retention; and prediction of PFC lifetimes for ITER under normal a nd off-normal conditions. Considerable attention has been paid to impurity dynamics and transport, including sources generated by plasma wall interactions. Using impurity injection techniques and a spectroscopic diagnostics, impurity diffusion and convection ha s been extensively studied. Improved modeling techniques and atomic data have been used for the analysis of spectra. The most recent initia tive on TEXTOR is the dynamic er godic divertor (DED). The DED is created by a set of non-axisymmetric co ils which can create perturbations with a variety of poloidal and toroidal mode numbers. The aim is to control heat and particle exhaust by distributing the load over larg e areas, which can be moved dynamically. A second goal is to modify plasma transport, pa rticularly for impurities, via ergodization of the edge magnetic field with the objective of increasing impurity screening and enhanced radiative cooling. The coil set can also be used in experiments to induce rotational shear and to explore the application of external ro tating magnetic fields to suppression of MHD instabilities. Fundamental study of transpor t and stability in these three-dimensional Interior of the TEXTOR Tokamak 115 Cutaway drawing of the Tore Supra device . fields could be useful in unde rstanding the role of such coils for ELM suppression and RWM control.

Long term prospects for TEXTOR operation are not clear at this time. Decisions are pending on an EU facility re view and the next (2009-2013) German five year plan. 3.b.16. Tore-Supra Tore Supra [3.b.16.1] is a large (R = 2.25 m, a = 0.7 m, B = 4.5 T) circular cross-section tokamak device with superconducting toroidal field coils that began operating in 1988 at the Centre d'Etudes de Cadarache, France. Tore Supra is the first tokamak constructed specifically to explore the possibilities of steady state operation. Its power and plasma heating supplies and in-vessel components\u2014RF antennas, lower hybrid launchers, limiters, and wall components\u2014are all actively cooled, and the heat handling capacity of the 116 Cutaway drawing of the W7X Stellarator. torus is 15 MW for 1000 s. This performance is representative of I TER operation in terms of average power density and heat exhaust capability. Plasma heating is accomplished using long pulse ICRF (10 MW) and lower hybrid (6 MW) heating systems. Key results of Tore Supra experiments so far are: [3.b.16.2-4] Stable, steady-state discharges usi ng lower hybrid current drive (power 3 MW, central density < 3 \u00d7 10 19 m-3, plasma current < 0.6 MA) and lasting more than 6 min with a total injected energy of 1 GJ have been obtained. High-power, high density discharg es with central density 5 \u00d7 1019 m-3, plasma current 0.9 MA, and B = 3.8 T have been sust ained in stationary conditions for periods of 15 seconds using 1.4 MW of lower hybrid current drive and 8.4 MW of ICRF power (H minority fraction ~ 12% ). These discharges operated at 80% of the Greenwald density and p 1, with T i0 Te0 4-5 keV. The normalized density and T i/Te ratio are similar to those envisaged for ITER steady-state operation, and the thermal stored energy exceeds that predicted by ITER L-mode scaling. Real-time feedback control of the current profile in lower hybrid current driven discharges with additional ICRF heati ng (total LH + ICRF injected power = 7 MW) has been used to maintain a moderate density (n e0 = 3 \u00d7 1019 m-3) plasma in an MHD stable configuration in stati onary conditions for periods of 60 s. Achievement of this long pulse, high po wer performance has been critically dependent on the development of real -time monitoring, diagnostic physics studies, and modeling of the in teractions of the edge pl asma with actively cooled high power lower hybrid launchers, ICRF antennas, the large toroidal pumped limiter, and the vacuum chamber wa lls. This research includes ongoing investigations of the mech anisms of deuterium retention in PFC components. Near term plans for Tore Supra focus on the extension of high tota l injected power (>15 MW), to durations > 30 s using improved kl ystron sources for lowe r hybrid power and advanced launchers and ICRF antennas which will test concepts being developed for ITER.

Its magnetic 117configuration is referred to as a helias, and is formed by a set of 50 non-circular, non- planar, \"twisted\" modular coils arranged in fi ve periods around the torus. An additional set of 20 planar toroidal field coils allow the rotational transform ( = 1/q, where q is the safety factor) to be varied above and below its nominal value (near unity) for experimental flexibility. The helical fields also provide a helica lly twisting divertor configuration. The divertor and vacuum ch amber are covered with graphite-composite tiles which are actively cooled to permit ope ration for periods ~30 min (steady-state). Initial heating will be provided by 10 MW of ECRH from ten 140 GHz CW gyrotrons, 4 MW of ICRF (also cw) and 5 MW of 60 keV NBI (15 s every 3 min). Subsequent increases in power to 9 MW of I CRF and 20 MW of NBI are planned. The helias configuration comprises fields of several different helicities, and was numerically optimized to have a number of special properties. The closed flux surface configuration is isodynamic, so that that the toroidal Pfirsch-Schl\u00fcter currents are greatly reduced, so that the Shafranov shift esse ntially vanishes for volume-averaged of up to more than 5%; the configuration is calculated to be stable to at least these values of . The field structure is designed so that components of the bootstrap driven by the toroidal and helical field variations (which flow in opposite directions) cance l to a high degree. The field configuration is thus practically inse nsitive to variations in plasma parameters. It is also designed to have a low effective helical ripple ~1%, and trapped particles are generally well confined, and confinement is further impr oved by the ambipolar radial electric field and the deepening of the diamagnetic well by finite- effects. The consequence of the W7-X design is that the pl asma is expected to have low neo-classical fluxes, good high-energy particle confinement, passively maintain its optimization at high with grossly stable operat ional and to allow steady-stat e operation without external current drive. The mission of W7-X is to demonstrate the basic reactor suitability of this concept. Some of the properties have already been tested by W7-AS, the predecessor of W7-X. W7-AS was partially optimized in its magnetic field characteristics, showed the feasibility of modular coils, demonstrated access to H- mode confinement regime, and sustained = 3.2% for more than 100 ener gy confinement times without any disruptions. W7-X will study confinement and stability of high b plasmas, and demons trate they can be sustained in steady state. The application of the W7 -X design principles to reactors has been studied in the HELIAS reactor design, incorpor ating the results from W7-AS. W7-X will test whether these characteristics can be obtai ned. In addition, W7-X will contribute to the development of steady-state technologies and operation, including power handling, RF launcher systems, and experience operating 3D superconducting coils.

Large Scale Modeling Projects 3.c.1 FSP The fusion simulation project is an initiative in the US with the intended goal of creating a comprehensive suite of integrated modeling codes. There are four drivers for the program 1) the need to support ITER and ex tend plasma simulation capabilities into a broader multi-physics, multi-scale domain 2) recent progress in plasma theory and computation and improvements in algorithms, numerics and applied math 3) the need to integrate physics understanding ob tained from research across the entire program and 4) the availability of increasingly powerful computers. Currently, only pilot projects are funded but the aim is to launch a large prog ram that would cost on the order $20M per year. With respect to ITER, the highest level goal of the FSP is to contribu te to making ITER a successful project. Simulation must support both operational and scientific requirements in order to most fully exploit what will be the largest, most expensive scientific instrument ever built for fusion plasma resear ch. These requirements are not thought to be divergent, since the ope rational needs can only be answered through improved scientific understanding. Sp ecifically, simulations would: 1. Help carry out the experimental program mo re efficiently - that is, to make the best use of the finite number of ITER pulses. 2. Enable new modes of operation, with possible extensions of performance. 3. Increase the scientific re turn on the government's investment in the project through improvements in data analysis and interpretation. 4. Provide an embodiment for the scien tific knowledge collected on ITER. There are further goals for the FSP which a lign with the OFES mission to \"advance the knowledge base needed for an economically an d environmentally attractive fusion energy source\". To this end, the FSP proposes to ca rry out cutting edge re search across a broad range of topics in computational plasma physic s. A project structure is envisioned where research components are developed, verified and validated, then migrate into the production suite. This migration may ta ke place by creation and improvements of reduced models or by direct incorpor ation into the production codes. If successful, the FSP would produce widely-used computational tools in support of a wide range of OFES programs. There would be a greater degree of emphasis on software engineering and user support which should al low the codes developed by the FSP to be broadly distributed and exploited. The impact could be felt across a large segment of the fusion energy program. It is worth noting two related international projects, the European Integrated Tokamak Modeling (ITM) task force and the Japanese Burning Plasma Simulation Initiative which are described below. 1193.c.2. Large scale European and Japanese plasma computation EU - Integrated Tokamak Modeling Task Force (ITM-TF) In Europe, an EFDA task force on Integrated Tokamak Modeling has been formed with the aim of providing a set of codes necessary for planning, operation and analysis for ITER. To achieve their goals, four topical research areas have been identified, which have formed the structure of the ITM-TF: Id entification of Codes & Models, Interfacing Procedure and Numerical Support, Code Valida tion and Benchmarking, ITER Integrated Scenario Activity. Two projects in informatics are supporting the development of physics codes. These are a Data Coordination Project, which is responsible for providing standardized data models and data access soft ware; and the Code Platform Project, which will enable cross-coupling between codes and common interfacing. A particular concern is standard access to experimental to facilitate c ode validation. Procedures for software quality assurance and version control are be ing implement. Five major physics projects have also begun, covering: equilibrium a nd MHD (IMP#1), non linear MHD, ELMs (IMP#2), energy and particle trans port (IMP#3), first principle transport and turbulence (IMP#4) and fast particles and heating (IMP#5). These groups will be responsible for benchmarking and validatin g physical and numerical models. More information is available at http://www.efda-taskforce-itm.org Japan - Burning Plasma Simu lation Initiative (BPSI) In Japan, the Burning Plasma Simulation Initi ative combines the efforts of universities with the National Institute for Fusion Scien ces (NIFS) and the Japanese Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA). Its goal is to integrate phys ics models, including transport, turbulence and MHD with models for heating, current drive and plasma wall interactions across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales . In the longer term, plasma physics and engineering codes would interact to include models for shielding and breeding blankets, materials interactions and heat and mass flow providing an overall simulation for burning plasmas. The basic integration approach is via loosely coupled modules interacting via common data structures. Staged development of new models would allow additional physics to be added as it becomes availabl e. The initiative wo uld incorporate new models for network or grid computing, modern code frameworks and advanced visualization techniques. Additi onal information is available at: http://p-grp.nucleng.kyoto-u.ac.jp/bpsi/en/ 3.c.3. Large scale simulations in support of technology 3.c.3.i Materials Research Due to the complexities of the fusion ener gy environment (simultaneous intense neutron and gamma ray irradiation, hi gh heat fluxes, and high mechan ical stresses) and the lack of a suitable experimental fusion materials testing facility, the development of materials for fusion energy applications must necessarily rely heavily on multiscale simulations. Modeling currently comprises about 25% of th e US fusion materials research portfolio, and heavily leverages connections within participating research institutions to the broader 120computational materials science community. The focus of the current fusion materials modeling activities is to disc over the controlling physical mechanisms that determine the microstructural evolution (and corresponding property changes) in materials due to irradiation, with particular emphasis on mech anical property degradation. The relevant length and time scales span ten and twenty orders of magnitude, respectively, making it impossible for a single model to accurately descri be the full breadth of physical processes. As noted in section 2.b.13, current state of the art multiscale modeling in computational materials science involves passing informati on between a series of specialized codes operating at different length an d time scales, ranging from atomistic first principles models to massively parallel finite elemen t codes. These codes are run on a variety of DOE Office of Science computational plat forms (BES, FES, ASCR) ranging from workstation clusters to leader ship class supercomputers. The major components of the existing multiscal e materials modeling ac tivities for fusion applications include ab initio atomistic models to develop realistic interatomic potentials for pure metals and compounds, molecular dynamics simulations to study defect migration mechanisms and activation energies and interactions betw een radiation defects and the existing microstructure (e.g., dislocations) as well as details of the initial damage state created in neutron displacement cascade s (source term for all subsequent radiation damage processes), kinetic M onte Carlo simulations to i nvestigate radiation defect interactions within individual grains of a ma terial, phase field and chemical rate theory models to investigate homogeneous micros tructural evolution as well as radiation induced segregation and radiation induced pr ecipitation processes, three-dimensional dislocation dynamics models to evaluate dislocation loop clustering and network dislocation evolution under mechanical stress, fi nite element models to evaluate effects of localized stress on fracture mechanics and overall deformation behavior in unirradiated and irradiated materials, and a variety of sp ecialized models to investigate effects of irradiation on important properties such as th ermal conductivity, fracture mechanics, etc. 3.c.3.ii Plasma wall interactions and plasma facing components Plasma wall interaction laboratory experiments and data from fusion machines have been used to validate models of erosion mechan isms, transport of impurities in the plasma edge, and retention of hydrogen isotopes in bo th eroded and redeposited material and in the original plasma facing material. The simulations are typically accomplished through the use of suites of codes where each sub- code computes specific physics in the interacting region. Examples of such su ites include: 1)UEDGE coupled to REDEP and WBC, 2) B2 coupled to EI RENE, 3)UEDGE coupled to DEGAS2, and 4) the HEIGHTS code package for analyzing disruption and la rge ELM effects on surfaces. In addition, specialized codes are used to simulate erosion (Fractal TRIM), tritium transport in materials (TMAP), and various Molecular Dynamics codes to study low energy reflection and trapping of plasma particles. Effort s are underway to develop kinetic codes to simulate situations where fluid codes like UEDGE and B2 are inappropriate. As these code suites are improved to in clude more detailed physical m odels, the need for increased computing power increases. The coupling of all the physics in the edge region of fusion devices cannot be accomplished simultaneously because of limitations in computing resources. The need to simulate plasma wall interactions in ITER to guide the design of 121ITER components has spurred the developmen t of better coupling between the various sub-models. Simulation of neutron transport, thermal-hydr aulics, thermal-stress, and electromagnetic effects during disruptions that are required fo r ITER design have been carried out using various commercially available codes. These codes are typically used during the design of other large engineering projects. Geom etric modeling of components is done using Computer Aided Design packages. Recen t releases of fluid dynamics, and electromagnetic codes that have simple easy to use interfaces with the CAD codes have reduced the cycle time for design iterations. However, the complexity that must be included in the component model that is needed for even conceptual design forces the analysis of relatively small sub-components of PFCs rather than the complete device. While there are engineering codes that run on very large massively parallel computers, those codes and/or computer s are typically not availabl e for fusion device design. Because of the long time between design activitie s for fusion devices, the cadre of trained engineers who understand the unique features of fusion devices have disappeared to other fields before the next fusion device needs their skills. 3.c.3.iii Safety The Fusion Safety program has developed several simulation codes to predict the response of fusion systems to accident scenarios, generation of activated material, the transport of activated materials, tritium tran sport in fusion components, and arcing of superconducting magnets during quench. These codes have been used to develop the safety basis for ITER and in the formati on of the USDoE Fusion Safety Code. MELCOR, a fission safety code, has been modified to in clude fusion specific characteristics such as large vacuum spaces and unique materials, an d used to simulate the response of fusion device components to loss of coolant or lo ss of flow accidents. The probability of component failure is based on large databa ses on reliability of various types of components gathered and maintained by the IA EA. Transport of radioactive material as aerosols is part of the simulation. The obj ective is to predict site boundary dose and worker dose in the plant. TMAP is used to model the transport of hydrogen isotopes in materials and vacuum spaces in a fusion plant. Neutron transport is analyzed using codes like MCNP (Monte Carlo method) or ATILLA (f inite element). Several codes are used to calculate activation of fusion materials give n the neutron flux and energy distribution. Fusion magnets are more likely to be su perconducting as longer pulse lengths are required. MAGARK is used to model quenche s in superconducting co ils and predict the probability of an electrical arc occurring. Experience gained from ITER licensing and operation will increase the confidence in these codes. 3.c.3.iv Fusion Engineering Sciences Fusion engineering scientific i ssues are substantially differe nt than other energy sources including fission. Examples of these unique at tributes include a) a very high surface heat flux and potentially high peaking factors, b) a complex volumetric heating source involving both plasma products (neutrons, pa rticle, and radiation) as well as nuclear reaction in the power extraction components, c) strong impact of electromagnetic field (both static and dynamic) on heat transfer a nd fluid dynamics, d) large temperature and 122stress gradients which can derive a mu ltitude of complex physical phenomena, e) compatibility with the fuel cycle (tritium production, transport, and extraction), f) complex geometry, and g) an evolving material properties (e.g., due to radiation effect). Because of the availability of large-scale computing, there has been a substation shift in engineering research towards science-based simulation tools as opposed to the empirical approach of repeated testing in prototypical environments (which is typically costly and time-consuming). Utilizing science-based si mulation capabilities is essential for developing fusion engineering sciences as the prototypical fusion environment for empirical testing does not exists. Some examples of predictive simulation capabilities are given below: 1) Developing predictive simulation capabil ities for the thermo-fluid dynamics of plasma facing components: \"Traditional\" approaches to high-heat flux components are not applicable to fusion because of potentially high peaking factors, large particle fluxes, electromagnetic loads, e volving material properties (due to both neutrons and particles fluxes), and geomet rical constraints. Proposed solutions involve modifying coolant flow profiles (tur bulent or transition to turbulent flows, impinging jets, etc.) which requires devel oping new understanding of heat transfer and fluid dynamics in regimes that have not been explored thoroughly before -- mainly through. Small bench-top experiment s in relevant dimensionless parameters can be used to develop and bench mark co mputational fluid dynamics codes for this application. 2) Developing predicative capability for the thermo-fluid dynamics in the blanket: Utilizing lithium-bearing, liquid metal alloys as the coolant have significant advantages. The thermo-fluid behavior is strongly affected by the electromagnetic field confining the plasmas or generated by the plasma itself. The flowing liquid metal will experience v X B forces magne tohydrodynamic effects) that are many times larger than viscous and inertial for ces. These forces have a large impact on flow profiles and heat transfer conditions. For fusion application, the science of liquid-metal MHD thermo-fluid dynamics should be extended to regimes with large variations in and gradients of the v X B forces, time-dependent EM fields generated by the plasma operation, and intense nuclear heating. Three-dimensional simulation tools are necessary to understand and op timize the thermo-fluid dynamics in the blanket. Small bench-top experiments in re levant dimensionless parameters can be used to bench mark computational fluid dynamics MHD codes. 3) Developing predictive simulation capab ilities of volumetric nuclear heating, tritium production, and changes induced in material constituents due to neutron- induced transmutation: The mean free-path for a 14-MeV neutron in material is typically 1-2 cm which can be comparable to many of the features (e.g., geometry, material composition) of the components surrounding a fusion plasma. It involves development of tools to accurately mode l the components surrounding the plasma (for example from CAD drawings) for an alysis by the Monte-Carlo codes for neutron and radiation transpor t. Such a predictive capability can be benchmarked by 123measurements (e.g., neutron flux) in pr esent high-power plasma experiments as well as ITER . 3.d. Technology facilities including IFMIF The world-wide fusion community has develope d over the last fifty years a large set of dedicated facilities for de veloping and validating the te chnologies needed for fusion research. For some applications the fusi on technology development program was able to utilize testing facili ties produced for non-fusion research (some with defense oriented objectives), which matched th e needs of the fusion program , and provided an economical path to validate technological issues. Sin ce Demo will have new or increased demands on technology as the era of high neutron flue nce commences, Testi ng Facilities world- wide will need to be enlisted or developed to meet the program objectives. Facilities that appear to be of interest dur ing the period between ITER an d Demo can be grouped into the following eight categories; PFC/Divert or Validation, Heating & Current Drive Technology, Fueling and Exhaust, Magnet Technology, Tritium Breeding and Extraction, Remote Handling, Power Supplies and Structural Materials. Generally existing facilities developed for ITER and other fusion programs should be sufficient, but in other cases, such as 14 MeV high neutron fluence sources, completely new facilities will have to be developed and commissioned. An overview of existing or planned fa cilities in each of the eight areas follows. 3.d.1 PFC/Divertor Validation Historically, new materials and PFC fabri cation techniques have been studied and improved through the use of dedicated test f acilities located in ma ny countries involved in fusion research. Understanding of the cap abilities of proposed designs for PFCs and the failure mechanisms most likely to occur during expected operating scenarios including transient events were determined as a result of careful experiments on such facilities. Several new material s have been confirmed for us e in fusion devices through the research conducted in such dedicated test facilities. Examples include carbon-carbon fiber composites, mechanical attachment sc hemes for short pulse devices and actively cooled PFCs for Tore Supra in the late 1980' s. Experiments on concepts for the ITER divertor were conducted all through the Engi neering Design Activity (EDA, a total of 7 years duration). The capability of PFCs to re move steady state heat flux increased from about 1 MW/m 2 to above 10 MW/m2 during this activity. Comparative studies were carried out on several heat sink designs to assu re reliability of the heat sink and the heat flux limits. These studies enabled the choice of designs that were optimized for use on ITER. Moving from ITER to Demo will requi re understanding of Helium cooled heat sinks since water is too reactive with high temperature PFCs to be acceptable for Demo. Helium coolant loops for PFCs are being added to existing test fac ilities but further upgrades (higher mass flow, higher operating temp erature) are needed to meet the needs of Demo. Refractory metals needed for Demo further emphasize the need for alternative coolants. Much higher neutron radiation damage must also be withstood by the components. Some new test facilities have been created and existing facilities upgraded to support the ITER mission or fusion devices under construction. Only one facility has the capability of testing irra diated components similar to what might be found on a Demo. 124At least two additional i rradiated material test facilities able to handle components up to 0.5 m2 (> 600 kW heating capability) are needed for Demo preparation. The following table summarizes the existing and planned facilities capable of PFC testing and development.

The four technologies are: Particle Injection, also known as Neutra l Beam Injection, NBI. -is the process by which high velocity particle s (normally isotopes of hydroge n) are injected into the core of the plasma, and through collis ions transfer energy to the plasma. Electron Cyclotron Heating and Current Dr ive, ECH or ECCD -is the process by which high power microwaves interact with the plasma electrons, where the microwave frequency (100+ GHz) and the resonant plasma frequency match. At the resonant zone energy in the microwav e beam is efficiently transferred to the electrons. Ion Cyclotron Heating and Current Driv e, ICH or ICCD - Which covers two different processes, but uses the same technology of Radio Frequency Waves. In one process Radio Frequency, RF waves (30 - 120 MHz) interact with the ions, at the ion cyclotron frequency and transfers en ergy to the ions directly. The other process is where RF Waves are launche d from a phased array antenna and the waves interact with the electrons. This pr ocess both heats the electrons and drives current where the coupling of the wave velocity and the electron velocity is maximum (normally in the core of the plasma). Lower Hybrid Current Drive, LHCD - is the process where RF waves at the Lower Hybrid frequencies (LHf = square root of the product of the ion cyclotron frequency and the electron cyclotron freque ncy) (3 - 8 GHz) ar e launched into the 126plasma with its electric field parallel to the magnetic field, so it can easily accelerate electrons along the field lines. 3.d.2.1 Neutral Beam Inj ection Test Facilities As the plasma densities of fusion experiment s have increased over the last few decades and into the future, looking towards Demo, the energy needed from the neutral beam systems has risen from 100 keV to 1 MeV a nd higher. The technological challenges for MeV grade NBI systems are the development of high power, high reliability, DC power supplies, MeV feedthroughs, negative-ion ion sources, and accelerating grid assemblies. Generally dedicated test stands are assembled to test specific sub components, sometimes at reduced size (e.g. an ion source test sta nd that tests a smaller size unit to validate current density extraction validation). Eventually an integrated test stand is assembled to test a full system. The highest performance neutral beam test stand is the 1 MV 40 A system being proposed to be constructed at the RFX facility in Padua, Italy. This will be able to test a full sized ITER negative ion based source and accelerator at full parameters for the 3600 s pulse duration required by ITER. The MeV Te st Facility (MTV) at Naka, Japan has the next highest rated performance, but can only te st at the 1 A level. The NB test stands being utilized for ITER are given in Table 3.d.2-1, with some of the lower voltage positive ion based source tests stand iden tified at the bottom of the table.

First is the developm ent of high power microwave sources, and the second is the development of in-vessel laun chers (mirrors) that can survive the harsh environment of high performance plasma and large neutron fluences. Presently the microwave source used in fusi on experiments is the gyrotron, which has a high unit power (>1 MW), high frequency ( 170 GHz),can operate for extended time (400 s to cw), and has a reasonable efficiency (~50% ). Gyrotrons, being electron tube devices, are easily developed and validated using test stands, which incorporate HV power supplies and water-cooled loads. However, until recently, fusion experiments only pulsed for a few seconds at a time, thus the te st stands built for gyrotron validation were only configured for similar short pulse lengths. With the advent of ITER some of the test 128stands were upgraded to longer pulse length (~cw) with the test stand at Naka, Japan having the most capability to date, but the test stand being built at CRPP, Lausanne, Switzerland, for ITER gyrotron validation, w ith its 2 MW capability will be able to support both and future gyrotron development. Other MW class gyro tron test facilities are available in Germany, Russia, and th e United States. Table 3.d.2-2 lists the parameters of various gyrotr on test facilities world-wide. Presently there are no test st ands devoted to the devel opment and validation of ECH mirrors that will be needed for Demo. The information for the design of such mirrors is expected to come from the testing and va lidation of Demo qualified PFCs (see section 3.d.2.1).

The RF sources used for fusion research thus are basically broadcast electron tubes that have been enhanced for higher power operation than used for normal commercial radio and television transmitter stat ions. In fact under US fusion technology development funding a 2 MW 30 to 120 MW, cw tetrode was developed that is now the standard transmitter tube used in the US fu sion program and is the tube of choice for ITER. Even though the RF source is developed there are still techno logical issues that need to be solved and validated for any high power Ion Cyclotron Heating System to be used on future fusion research devices. These issues arise from the situation that there is a dynamic interaction between the fusion plasma and the RF launcher (antenna), and the coupling system (transmission line and tuners ) that is needed to optimize the power delivery to the plasma. Historically test st ands have been devel oped to address these issues individually, with the final system in tegration being performed at the fusion device site where the auxiliary support systems are available, Even though ITER will establish and demonstr ate the technology needed for reactor level ICH systems, the results may indicate that the standard strap antennas do not have the coupling efficiency and performance needed for Demo, let alone that the antenna will have to be constructed from materials th at can survive the high performance fusion environment. It is anticipated that the pr esent and planned test stands shown in table 3.d.2-3 will provide most of the validation n eeded for Demo, other than the validation of 130the compatibility and robustness of the an tenna system within the fusion nuclear environment. It is also possi ble that new test sta nd capabilities will need to be developed if testing of alternate antenna concepts is not compatible with these test stands facilities.

The Klystrons used in fu sion experiments found their genesis in the High Energy Physics arena and were modified by their manufactures to transition from a pulsed mode to a continuous operation mode. Most validation testing was performed at the manufacturer's site so few test stands we re needed. The only test stand dedicated to Lower Hybrid systems is at the CEA facility in Cadarache, France (see Table 3.d.2-4). It is anticipated that when the need for Lo wer Hybrid becomes is authorized for either ITER or the other next generation fusion experiments that additional test stand facilities will be needed. In particular to address the validation of the launcher system, which is very challenging, because of the need fo r close wave-plasma coupling and the harsh environment and heat loads.

The US has lead the development of high speed pellet fueling, with most facilities that utilize pellet fueling obtaining their hardware or technology from the Oak Ridge National La boratory, ORNL (see table 3.2.3-1). However there could be a limitation on pellet penetration (using present day technology), and new concepts with higher velocities may have to be developed, which will require new facilities or modification to the facility at ORNL. For exhaust control, no dedicated facility is envisioned, however some form of technology development and validation will be anticipated, but should easily supported at most laboratories.

Thus th ere will be a continuous need to explore improvements in superconducting magnet capability (e.g. higher fields, higher tolerance to neutrons, lower manufacturi ng costs, etc.) as well as adapting the latest improvements in strand technology and new high temperatur e superconducting material, HTSC. During the development phase the test stands listed in Table 3.d.4-1 should be sufficient to explore the next generation of magnet deve lopment through the strand validation phase. It is only when magnet development need s to actually validate a complete coil that existing test stands may not have the requ ired capability, and a new test stand, or modification to an existing test stand will have to be constructed.

Even though ITER will pr ovide a test bed for trying several different concepts for Tritium breeding, there is significant amount of work that must stil l be performed before a system to be used on DEMO would be qualified and licensable. The challenge being faced in developing a co mpletely self-sustaining Tritium breeding and extraction system can be broken down into the five following processes: Tritium breeding, in either a solid or liquid medium; Tritium extraction from the breeding medium; gas stream purification; Tritium st orage; and Tritium accountability. All of theses tasks will have to be performed at a process level an order of magnitude larger than that experienced in ITER. The test sta nd facilities now being assembled for the Test Blanket Module, TBM, program on ITER, will be useful to extending this technology to the needs of DEMO, probably with upgrades to several of the key facilities. Table 3.d.5- 1 lists several of the facilities that are bei ng enlisted to support the ITER TBM program. The table has been organized into facilities that focus on Tritium, He gas cooling loops, and Liquid metal cooling loops. It is inc onceivable that the licensing of the critical DEMO fuel subsystem would be granted with out a full-scale demonstration, which is only achievable on a Component Test Facility.

This means that the components of DEMO need to be robust and dependable. Additionally, if and when there is a need to change or re pair components within DEMO, the changes must be performed quickly, e fficiently, and achieve the same level of robustness and dependability as the original in stallation, and all of the work has to be performed remotely. To achieve this level of sophistication will require that remote handling be integrated into the design of th e components at an ea rly stage; and that advanced remote handling tooling that can cu t, weld, remove, reweld, and inspect, be developed and validated on de dicated test facilities. Historically, remote handling test faciliti es have been assembled by the research programs, as required to meet the needs of th eir program. To this end, remote handling R&D was performed on ITER, but it was focused on satisfying the needs of ITER, which has different objectives than DEMO. Regardle ss, the lessons learned on ITER are a good starting point for DEMO, and the test stand facilities used fo r ITER, see table 3.d.6-1, can be utilized to investigate the re mote handling concepts for DEMO. Table 3.d.6-1 Remote Handling Test Facilities Facility (Country, Lab) Capability Remote Handling Divertor Test Platform 2 (EU, VTT) Mock-up facility to test Divertor RH equipment (Movers, end-effectors and tooling), demonstrates the major elements of the ITER divertor exchange process Divertor Refurbishment Platform (DRP) Mock-up facility to test methods and equipment for Divertor RH refurbishment in the Hot Cell 138(EU, ENEA Brasimone) (Hot Cell workstation, component handling devices and tooling).

The power supplies are typically custom engineered for each appl ication, but are base d upon technology well developed in commercial power supply applic ations. The main differences of fusion based power supplies from typical commercial applications, is th e large unit powers needed, with corresponding issues on ener gy loss management, as well as insulation issues with high voltages, a nd mechanical stresses resulti ng from the large currents delivered to the load. Since most, if not all, of the power supply manufactures do not have in house facilities for complete fact ory acceptance testing, the final acceptance testing can only be on site, were there is su fficient source power and auxiliary equipment. It is possible that new power supply tec hnology will be developed that may have a promising application to fusion power supplie s, that would make them perform better, have higher efficiency, lower manufacturing cost s, or provide better protection to system faults. Under these conditions it would be prudent to test these new technologies or applications on a test stand. It is very likel y that the test stands listed in Table 3.d.7-1 will be sufficient to perform the validation test s. If not new facilities will need to be constructed.

These facility categories are irradiati on facilities, physical and mechanical property test facilities, mi crostructural characterization facilities, corrosion facilities, and materials joining f acilities. It is anticip ated that fusion will continue to utilize the multibillion dollar in vestments by non-fusion agencies in advanced materials characterization fac ilities. These include neutron scattering characterization at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) and the High Flux Isotopes Reactor (HFIR) and X- ray scattering characterization at the Adva nced Photon Source (APS) , all of which are funded by BES, small angle neutron scatte ring facilities at NIST sponsored by the Department of Commerce, and electron micr oscopy national user centers sponsored by BES and DOE-EERE. 3.d.8.1 Irradiation facilities The fusion materials program has utilized numerous irradiation facilities built and maintained by BES, NE or NNSA funding, and it is anticipated thes e facilities will continue to be beneficially used to inve stigate fundamental radiation effects phenomena in the future in order to pave the way to Demo. These facilities include ion beam irradiation facilities at ANL, LANL and PNNL that are useful for single-effects studies of microstructural changes in materials associated with displacement damage, numerous gamma irradiation facilities lo cated at national laboratories and universities, and fission neutron reactors that can accommodate a wide variety of specimen geometries to extract comprehensive mechanical and physical propert y changes associated with fission neutron damage. Most of the fusion materials neut ron irradiations have utilized the BES- supported HFIR facility. A few irradiation test s over the past 15 years have also utilized the NE-supported Advanced Test Reactor (ATR). Both of these test reactors have a replacement cost in excess of 1 B$, and have an annual operating budget in excess of 50M$. The key operational parameters of the ion and neutron irradiation facilities are summarized in Table 3.d.8-1. Typical capsu le volumes in HFIR and the higher flux irradiation positions in ATR are 100 to 700 cm 3, and achievable displacement damage rates are typically 5 to 15 dpa per year. The proposed International Fusion Materials Irra diation Facility (IFMI F) is intended to satisfy the dual purposes of (a) science-base d investigation of ma terials behavior in fusion-relevant environment (i.e., acquire experimental data including fundamental constitutive mechanical properties essentia l for model-based development of radiation- resistant materials) and (b) developing expe rimental database on structural materials needed to license a fusion demonstration power plant reactor and to provide robust engineering confidence for its structures. Since the physics of defect migration and 140accumulation are strongly affected by He in a complex manner (which in turn modifies the microstructural evolution), current models are unable to extra polate results obtained from the low He/dpa regimes associated with fission reactor irradiations to the fusion-relevant regime. A fusion-releva nt irradiation facility is needed to guide the development of new predictive models. Due to the physics of deformation and fracture, experimental testing of radiation damage in a fusion material at a given temperature requires an intense neutron source with the substantial test volumes (>>10 cm 3) and modest neutron flux gradients (<10%/cm) that could be achieved in a dedicated facility such as the proposed IFMIF. The design parameters for IFMI F are summarized in Table 3.d.8-1. Considering the long time that will be required to complete the detailed engineering design and to construct IFMIF, the ques tion has arisen whether accelerator-based spallation neutron sources can provide insi ght on the microstructural evolution of materials at fusion-relevant He/dpa leve ls. A Materials Test Station (MTS) design proposed by LANL utilizing the LANSCE fac ility would enable damage levels up to 18 dpa/year at 5 to 25 appm He/dpa in an irra diation volume approximately one-half that of IFMIF. Similar irradiation para meters might be achievable from a dedicated test station at the beam dump region of the Spallation Neutro n Source. Utilization of such a spallation neutron facility might accelerate the developm ent of fusion materials and could reduce or potentially eliminate the need for US part icipation as a full partner in IFMIF. Table 3.d.8-1. Summary of the proposed IF MIF and Existing Ion and Neutron Irradiation Facility Parameters (He/dpa values are for ferritic steel; maximum 4 year irradiation assumed for the fission reactor max doses).

Th ese facilities range from synchrotron and neutron scattering national user facilities sponsored by BES or the Department of Commerce (APS, SNS, HFIR Ce nter for Neutron Scattering, NIST reactor) to several advanced electron microscopy national user centers sponsored by BES (SHaRE user facility at ORNL, electron microscopy user centers at LBNL and ANL, and various user centers at Universities) or EERE (High Temper ature Materials Lab user center at ORNL), and atom probe characterization associated with the SHaRE facility at ORNL. With appropriate procedures, most of these facilities can be used for examination of neutron irradiated materials. Numer ous additional materials char acterization facilities are available for potential investig ations of fusion materials at a wide number of US institutions. 3.d.8.3 Physical and mechanic al property test facilities Several different categories of physical and mechanical propert y test facilities are currently available in the US. For highly irradiated radioactive specimens, testing of most key mechanical and physical propertie s can be performed in dedicated hot cell facilities such as the Irradiated Materials Examination and Testing (IMET) facility at ORNL. Capability for mechanical property te sting of specimens currently exists in several national laboratory facilities, incl uding PNNL INL and LA NL. Specimens with reduced levels of radioactivity can be tested in specialized hot labora tory facilities such as the Low Activation Materials Development and Analysis (LAMDA) facility at ORNL. Finally, if the specimen radioactivity is su fficiently small, testing in general purpose laboratories can usually be performed in nati onal laboratories and some universities by temporarily creating a radiological area with in the testing lab. 3.d.8.4 Corrosion test facilities The US capabilities for corrosion testing using liquid metals such as Pb-Li or Li is greatly reduced compared to the 1960s where dozens of institutions were performing hundreds of corrosion loop tests on a variety of coolants and structures. Some investment by DOE will be needed to reestablish an appropriate level of experimental capability (perhaps in conjunction with DOE-NE, depending on the future of proposed Generation IV fission reactor research activities, some of which u tilize coolants that have some similarity to fusion-relevant coolants, e.g., Pb-Bi, Na al kali metal, and high temperature helium). 3.d.8.5 Joining research facilities Funding for joining research in the US ha s dropped precipitously over the past twenty years. As a result, there is a danger that ag ing equipment currently occupying lab space at national labs and universities may be discar ded in the near future. Investment by DOE 142(again, perhaps in conjunction with DOE-NE in association with the Generation IV fission reactor program) will be needed to maintain and enhance the current capability for joining. There are several new joining technique s such as friction stir welding that should be considered for sustained funding to determ ine their applicability for joining complex fusion structures. 3.e. International Fusion Development Plans 3.e.1 U.S. Fusion Development Planning A roadmap for fusion development in the U.S. was laid out by a recent FESAC panel [3.e.1.1] but has not been adopted as official policy. In that plan, Demo is the last step before commercialization of fusion energy. Demo must provide power producers with the confidence to invest in commercial fusi on as their next gene ration power plant, i.e., demonstrate that fusion is practical, reliab le, economically competitive, and meets public acceptance. In addition, Demo must operate reliably and safely on the power grid for long periods of times ( i.e., years) so that power producers gain operational experience. The top level goals for the U.S. Demo [3.e.1.1] are summarized below: Integration and Scalability to a Commercial Power Plant: 1. Use the physics and technology antic ipated for the first generation of commercial power plants as an integrated system 2. Be of sufficient size for confident scalability (>50%-75% of commercial). Reliability 3. Demonstrate robotic or remote maintenance of fusion core. 4. Demonstrate routine operation with minimum number of unscheduled shutdowns per year. 5. Ultimately achieve an availability > 50% and extrapolate to commercially desired levels. Safety and Environmental Impact: 6. Not require an evacuation plan. 7. Generate only low-level waste. 8. Not disturb the public's day-to-day activities. 9. Not expose workers to a higher risk than other power plants. 10. Demonstrate a closed tritium fuel cycle. Economics: 11. Demonstrate that the co st of electricity from a commercial fusion power plant will likely be competitive. The U.S. Demo must use and demonstrat e the same technologies that will be incorporated in a fully-commercial power pl ant. This requirement is fundamental in determining the features of the Demo and ma y or may not be adopted by other countries in their definition of a Demo.\" If the basi c technologies are change d following the Demo, then another Demo must be built before th e design and construction of the commercial plant. A private investor will not accept ri sk of failure or reduced performance due to 143unproven and undemonstrated technologies. Add itionally, it may be impossible to insure and/or license such a plant. This requirement allows for the performance levels to be reduced from a fully commercial plant as specified in the rema ining Demo requirements. For example, a reduced level of thermal effi ciency, availability and com ponent lifetime in the Demo (owing to less competitive cost of electricit y) allows the components to be designed slightly different and operate at lower temper atures and stresses. There is no requirement that specifies the component operating conditions must be exactly prototypical. However, through operation of the Demo, a high level of c onfidence must be gained so that the first commercial plant is assured to meet the more stringent commercial power plant requirements. If performance levels are reduced from that of a full commercial plant, then the ability to extrapolate must be clearly demonstrated.[ 3.e.1.2] International Demo Characteristics The international partners pres ently involved in the constructi on of ITER have carried out a number of technical studies of the requireme nts for a fusion power plant. The goals for the various international fusion power plants va ry significantly, mainly in the degree of economic competitiveness that must be achieved in the first generation of power plants. The US Advanced Reactor Innovation Evalua tion Studies (ARIES) [3.e.1.3] and the European Power Plant Conceptual Studies (PPCS) [3.e.1.4] have examined a range of possible power plants that are include system s with modest extrapolation in physics and technology to systems with advanced physics an d technology that illu strate the ultimate performance of fusion power plants. These stud ies of potential power plant help identify the key issues that a Demo must address a nd give a range of physical parameters that provide a useful measure in assessing the ex trapolation from today's knowledge base to that required for Demo. Direct extrapolation from ITER physics and technology characteristics would yield a very large power plant with non-competitive economics. The table below illustrates improvements needed for an entry-level power plant (ARIES-I', PPCS-A) and the ultimate performance (ARIES-AT, PPCS-D) that could be attained using both advanced physics and technology. In the U.S, the fusion Demo is viewed as a prototype for an economically competitive fusion power plant and is exp ected to operate w ith the technologies of a fusion power plant, and with parameters approaching those anticipated for a power plant. In the EU, the fusion Demo is viewed as a roll-forwar d step with modest extrapolations beyond ITER. The EU Demo would typically lead to a first generation fusi on power plant with less competitive economics. Recently, the EU has undertaken a study of Demo including the possibility of an early Demo with re duced requirements [3.e.1.5]. Given this difference, one might expect more than one De mo to be built with generic characteristics similar to those listed below. 144Table of Typical Parameters for Fusion Power Plants 7 6 5.6 Ip(MA) 15 9 12.6 30 11.3 14 Iext-CD (%) 0 50 43 55 9 23 Pelect (MW) 0 0 1000 1550 1000 10, <1 5, <1 25, 3.4 20, 45, 7.1 34, N 1.8 2.8 2.9 3.5 5.4 4.5 n (MWm-2) 0.5 0.4 1.5 2.2 3.3 2.4 Pulse Length 400s 3000 s Steady Steady Steady Steady Availability,% ~5 ~10 80 75 80 75 Fluence (dpa) 0 0.3 150 150 150 150 Breeder Matl Test Test Solid Li LiPb LiPb LiPb TBR 0 < 0.01 1 1.06 1 1.12 Coolant water water Water LiPb LiPb Opting T(\u00b0C) 150 150 600 167 1000 990 Struct Matls Sta Steel Sta Steel SiC Ferr Steel SiC SiC Remote Maint In Vess In Vess Sector In Vess Sector In Vess High Level Characteristics for Demo Materials for PFCs and Blankets that are candidates for 1st Power Plant Significant fusion power ~1 GW th at moderate Q ~15, n > 1 MWm-2 Closed fuel cycle - Tritium breeding with TBR 1.0 (this goal that must be accomplished) \"Steady state\" operation with moderate f bs and CD (pulses ~ week duration at beginning, month long near end) Reasonable availability appr oaching 50% after 10 years Heat extraction at reasonable to produce electricity References [3.e.1.1] FESAC - 35 year Plan, 2003 [3.e.1.2] Starlite , U.S. Fusion De mo Power Plant, ANL/FPP-87-1, 1992 [3.e.1.3] ARIES [3.e.1.4] EU Power Plant [3.e.1.5] EURATOM Study on Early Demo 1453.e.2. EU Fast track Plan Beginning in 2001, scientists in the EU have mapped out a \"Fast Track\" plan for development of fusion energy [3.e.2.1,2]. The endpoint is electr icity generation from commercial fusion power plants approximately 40 years from the go-ahead decision on ITER. The fusion reactor concepts have b een discussed in a series of papers and reports.[ 3.e.2.3,4] but has not been adopted as official EU policy. The fast track plan represents a top-down strategic view. It is intended as a roadmap and a description of technical feasibility not a prediction or blueprint. An exercise in \"bottoms up\" planning, design and costing ha s not been carried out. The reactor options defined in the references mentioned above span a range of phys ics and engineering options, with decreasing COE and graduated assumptions for advanced plasma operation and materials. Principle physics levers identif ied were 1) adequate confinement, 2) high N 3) high n G. Principle technology levers involv e blanket and divertor performance including the associated materials issues. The current terminology in the plan seems to a lign closely with US usage. The last step before commercialization is cal led Demo (not PROTO). It is important to note however, that in the base case for the fast track pl an, Demo has two phases. Only the second corresponds to the definition used in the US Fusion Development Plan report [3.e.2.5] - that is a high-availability, el ectricity producing, prototype reactor. The first phase roughly corresponds to the US vision for CTF, but its mission would be carried out in the Demo facility. Vision for Demo within fast track plan The requirements and mission for Demo are, of course critical elements in the plan. These are summarized: Be based on and confirm at higher fusion power, the plasma physics basis developed by ITER and parallel devices. Be based on low-activation, long-lifetime materials successfully tested in IFMIF Demonstrate the safety and environmental advantages of fusion For phase I, Demo must - Confirm the first wall lifetimes in simu ltaneous plasma and neutron fluxes. - Provide information on the main problems of materials compatibility and reliability for blankets and divertors to support optimized design for phase II For phase II, Demo must demonstrate - High availability energy supply for grid - High reliability and availability espe cially of blankets and divertors - Long lifetime and compatibility of materials and components - Tritium self-sufficiency - Costing projections Major elements of plan: \"Pillars\" and \"Buttresses\" The overall fast track strategy organized around \"Pillars\" and \"Buttresses\". There is a basic assumption from EU studies [3.e.2.3,4 ] that fusion could be a practical energy 146source without advanced operations (AT) or major advances in materials. (Note: this is not the consensus in the US.) These elements are summarized in the following table. Pillars Buttresses Elements ITER IFMIF Demo Existing & Future tokamaks CTF 2 nd IFMIF Existing & Future alternates Multiple parallel Demos Purpose Minimal set of facilities necessary for commercialization of fusion energy 1. Accelerate timetable 2. Mitigate risks 3. Improve 2 nd generation fusion plants Timetable High availability Demo in 37 years from ITER decision, 1st commercial plant 6 years later Saves ~ 4 years from baseline (aggressive) plan (buttresses could lower schedule risk) Background EU studies [3.e.2.3,4] conclude that fusion could be practical energy source without advanced modes of plasma operation or major materials advance. Same study shows significant decrease in COE with advanced operations and materials Requirements ITER and IFMIF must focus almost exclusively on Demo issues. (Early DT operation on ITER is important) Parallel efforts, higher funding levels Notes Without buttresses, Demo has two phases, only phase II corresponds to US vision for Demo. With CTF, plan goes directly to high-availability Demo Pillars - Main steps in Fast Track plan 1. Operation of current large tokamaks 2. Immediate start to ITER 3. Design and build IFMIF as soon as possible 4. Agreement on main features and choices for Demo 5. Prioritization of ITER and IF MIF operation to support Demo 6. Provisional design of Demo as ITER and IFMIF results are available 7. Construction of Demo as soon as licensing is possible Buttresses - role and examples Accelerate schedule - Existing and planned tokamaks speed up and maximize scientific return from ITER 147- 2nd IFMIF speeds materials qualification - CTF allows full test of blanket modules before Demo Reduce risk - 2nd IFMIF allows wider range of materials to be tested - CTF increases database for Demo design - Multiple Demos could test wider range of materials and operational regimes - Alternate confinement concepts coul d avoid tokamak show-stoppers (e.g. disruptions) Improve performance/COE for following generation of reactors - Advanced tokamak operation leads to improved reactor, lowered costs - Development and qualification of advanced materials - Alternates if/as they develop Major technical issues identified for program The following are categories of technical issues that must be solved before commercialization. Any development plan must have a strategy for reso lving all of them. In the EU plan, ITER has the major role in resolving 1,2,3,4,5,13,14,16 IFMIF principally deals with 7 & 8, and Demo would be responsible for resolving the rest. The \"pillar only\" strategy assumes that all physics issues are resolved by ITER, and that ITER plus the TBM program plus IFMIF are sufficien t for blanket design and first wall/divertor design. 1. Disruption avoidance and mitigation 2. Steady state operation - bootstrap and CD, engineering issues 3. Divertor performance - plasma surface interactions, materials, heat removal 4. Integrated burning plasma - control, stability, confinement, physics 5. Plasma performance - operating limits, especially pressure 6. Tritium self sufficiency - retention, breeding 7. Materials development - for PFC a nd structure, good performance under irradiation 8. Materials characterization - for licensing 9. PFC lifetime - survival and replacement 10. First wall/blanket materials lifetime - ne utrons, invessel environment, cooling 11. First wall/blanket components lifetime - as above, but including component scale issues, including welding/joining technologies 12. Divertor materials lifetime - similar to PFC, but in different environment 13. Heating and current drive - efficiency, availability 14. Superconducting magnets - control, availability 15. Electricity generation at high availability - integration, reliability, maintenance 16. Remote handling Risks and Mitigation The EU plan gives considerable thought to program and schedule risks. The basic feasibility and advantages of fu sion power are assumed, so the risks are either 1) delay or 2) degradation in performance of initial fu sion power plants. Th e most notable risk factors are delays in qualifying suitable materials and in demonstrating tritium self- 148sufficiency. Risk mitigation is considered via analysis of \"risk-adjusted net present value\". The overall conclusion is that, given the a ssumed advantages for fusion power and the size of the electric power industry, steps to mitigate identified risks can be economically justified, even with radical incr eases in research expenditures. Comparison with US (FESAC) fu sion energy development plan The US plan [3.e.2.5] is characterized by: More aggressive vision for Demo, based on advanced operating modes CTF viewed as essential Inclusion of IFE on \"equal\" footing with MFE More prominent role for alternate concept development Some Issues/Questions that the EU plan raises for US 1. What is the impact on the ITER scientif ic program - fast track plan advocates \"industrial\" approach, energy mission is explic it and has priority for all facilities. 2. What will be the US access to IFMIF data? 3. Will US have any role in choosing IFMIF materials? 4. Will either of these last two issues constrain US designs for Demo? 5. To what extent are current materials and current operating modes acceptable for reactor? 6. An early CTF is clearly desirable, does it become irrelevant if it comes late? 7. Is a 2-phase Demo feasible or practical ? (Do we compromise the ultimate Demo mission?)

Japanese Development Plan This summary is based on the \"National Polic y of Future Nuclear Fusion Research and Development\" document published on October 26, 2005 by the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission's Advisory Committee on Nucl ear Fusion. The Atomic Energy Commission established the Third Phase Basic Program of Fusion Research and Development in June 1992. The Advisory Committee on Nuclear Fusion wrote their 2005 report as part of a period ic \"check and review\" called for at the establishment of the Third Phase Program. The principal subjects covered in the report are: Role of fusion in solving energy and environmental problems Position of fusion R&D in the Nuclear Energy Policy Check and review of progress of the Third Phase Program Development strategy for fusion energy with maximum utilization of ITER Role of academic research on fusion (universities and NIFS) Training and education of researchers, and securing human resources Utilization of international collaborations The Committee members \"expect th at this report cl arifies the policy to be undertaken in the Third Phase Program, and will become th e basic guidelines for future Fusion R&D of our country.\" Overall Strategy and Timescale Their goal is to begin the practical use of fusion power before the middle of the 21 st century. That will require successful completi on of two phases. The Third Phase, which they are in now, will culminate in the decision to construct Demo. The Forth Phase will focus on technical demonstration and econo mical feasibility in Demo. Successful completion of the Fourth Phase will be the d ecision to begin the practical use of fusion. They recognize that fusion research is a field where Japan \"can lead the world.\" Demo Characteristics Economic feasibility requires Demo to have fusion power densities several times higher than ITER. Demo must operate in a steady- state mode without interruption for at least one year with the following characteristics: High plant efficiency High output stability Tritium breeding ratio >1 Thermal output of 3-4 GW These requirements impose stringent re quirements on non-inductive current drive systems, and particle and heat control system s. First wall materials must be able to withstand a neutron flux of 10-20 MW-yrs/m 2, and a heat flux of 1 MW/m2. The divertor components have to withstand even higher he at and particle fluxes. Economics also 150require high plant availability, which impos e limits on the frequency and duration of maintenance periods. Decision Criteria for Starting the Fourth Phase (Demo) The transition to the Demo phase will requir e the demonstration or development of the following: 1. Burn control in self-heated regime in ITER. 2. Non-inductive operation of I TER for >1000 seconds with Q > 5. 3. Technology integration on ITER. 4. High-beta steady-state operation method re quired by economics (National Centralized Tokamak). 5. Materials and fusion t echnology relevant to Demo. 6. Conceptual Design of Demo 7. Understanding of fusion commercialization pr ospects, with participation of the private sector, and the evaluation of progress in fusion research including non-tokamak methods. Major Elements of Phase Three To meet the Demo decision criteria, Phas e Three utilizes the following elements: Tokamak research using ITER Tokamak improvement research, focuse d on high-beta steady-state operation. Development of fusion technologies, including breeding and power generation blankets, structural materials, superconduc ting magnets, heating and current drive systems (beam and RF), tritium handling and safety systems, and radioactive waste reduction and processing. Research on fusion reactor systems, in cluding the conceptual design of Demo. Tokamak theory and simulation, including support for ITER (plasma control, data acquisition, and analysis) and for conceptual Demo and reactor designs. Societal and environmental safety research to prepare the way for gaining approval for constructing fusion power plants in Japan. Helical device research to assess fusion reactor potential a nd to study high-beta steady-state plasma physic s and divertor issues. Laser-driven inertial fusion research to achieve ignition and burning plasma conditions. Fundamental fusion research using sma ll-to-medium-sized devices, theory and simulation. Fusion technology development needed fo r laser-fusion-based reactor designs. Basic research on materials and on fusion technologies. The major facilities that will be used in Phase Three are: ITER Fully utilize ITER to demonstrate burning pl asma control in the self-ignition regime (Q>20) for several 100 seconds, and in a steady-state mode (>1000 s) with Q>5. It will 151also establish the technologi cal basis for the integrated operations of superconducting coils, remote maintenance, tritium handling, in vessel components, and small-scale blanket technologies. JT-60 Contribute to international physics activities to improve ITER performance and expand its operational margins. These include st udies of confinement (including high energy particles), stability, current drive, and divert or heat and particle control in long-pulse regimes. In addition, carry out preliminary R&D on l ong-duration stable maintenance of high-beta (3.5-5.5) plasmas to establish the scientific ba sis for Demo. To further this research, the facility will be converted into the National Centralized Tokamak. National Centralized Tokamak (JT-60SA) Explore ways to sustain high-normalized-beta (3.5-5.5) plasmas near breakeven parameters for more than 100 s. It will also seek advances in heating and current drive systems, and aim at a stable operation of high-beta plasmas lasting several hours. International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) Study materials in a high-energy neutron environm ent similar to that ex pected in a fusion reactor, including the effects of helium and hydrogen produced in materials exposed to such an environment. LHD Explore confinement improvement and contribute to the worldwide effort to optimize 3- dimensional steady-state confinement system s for a reactor-core plasma. Studies will also enhance the general understand ing of toroidal confinement. FIREX Use a new high-intensity short-pulse laser in the FIREX first-phase program to achieve ignition temperatures in the fuel comp ressed by the existing GEKKO-XII laser. Comparison with the US Fusion Energy Plan The US FESAC report \"A Plan for the Deve lopment of Fusion Energy,\" March, 2003, represents the most recent expression of th e US technical fusion community's view of what would be a reasonable US fusion ener gy development plan. However, the US government has not officially adopted that plan, or any other plan, and there are substantial differences between the FESAC pl an and what is presently funded by the US DOE. The following list attempts to compare the Japanese plan (J) with the FESAC plan (F), and with what is funded by the DOE. J and F have a similar vision of Demo, requiring advanced operating modes. No US or Japanese commitment to build a Demo at this time. J and F both view advanced tokamak resear ch as essential. DOE has made no commitment to build a facility similar to the National Centralized Tokamak. 152 J and F both view fusion theory and modeling as essential. DOE funding is constrained. J does not mention a CTF, but F views CTF as essential. J and F view fusion technologies and mate rials development as essential. DOE funding is highly constrained. J and F view fusion system studies, includ ing safety and waste issues, for Demo and reactors as essential. DOE funding is highly constrained. J views IFE (lasers) as one of two major approaches to fusion energy other than tokamak (their other major alternate is the helical system), while F views IFE on an equal footing with MFE. DOE funds in ertial fusion research as part of HEDP, not as path to energy. J and F view innovative confinement concepts similarly. DOE funding is constrained. 3.e.4. Korean Plans This summary is based on a presentation gi ven by G. S. Lee in September 2006 titled \"Overview of Korean National Fusion Progr am, Current Status and Future Plans.\" The main topics covered in the presentation are: Energy situation in Korea (dependence on imported energy, CO 2 emissions, etc.) National Fusion Research Center organization KSTAR construction and operation ITER participation KO fusion energy development Process for establishing a Korean fusion energy strategy A law-making process has begun to establish a long-term fusion ener gy strategy and to assure national energy security. The Fusion Energy Development Promotion Act provides for mid-term and long-term pl anning and resource allocation, for the establishment of a central institute, and for the support of ITER collaboration. Korea appears to be in the early stages of form ulating its domestic long-term plan for fusion energy development. Overall Strategy and Timescale A Korean commercial fusion reactor supplying electricity to the grid is envisioned to begin operating in the 2040s. Its design will be completed when Demo demonstrates electricity production around 2035. Korea should \"play a leading role\" in the design of Demo. Demo Characteristics Demo will be designed to achieve 0.5 to 1 GWe continuous operation, with high beta normal (3.5-5.5). 153Major Program Elements Leading to Demo The four major elements are KSTAR, I TER, IFMIF, and fusion technology R&D. KSTAR is being constructed fo r steady-state advanced toka mak (AT) research. First plasma is expected in June 2008. Followi ng the initial operations phase, the three research phases will focus on steady-state operation, then high- performance AT-mode (beta normal ~5), and finally steady-state, high performance AT-mode. Design and construction of KSTAR and com ponents for ITER is providing valuable experience with large superconducting tokamak technologies. Operation of KSTAR will provide a test bed for contributing to ITER operations and for fusion technology development. The final research phase (steady state, high beta) will provide data for the design of Demo. Further experience with plasma operation and control and with reactor technologies will be obtained by participating in ITER operations. A fusion reactor technology R&D program will be developed to contribute to ITER and Demo. One part of that program will be building and eval uating test blanket modules in ITER. Participation in IFMIF for materials testing is anticipated. 3.e.5. Chinese Plans This summary is based entirely on presenta tions by Jiangang Li, director of the ASIPP and Jikang Xie, deputy direct or of EAST tokamak. Fusion energy is particularly appealing in Ch ina because of the rapid economic growth. The estimates are that the population will reach 1.6 billion by 2050, with energy per person approaching the levels currently experi enced in Japan and Europe. Problems with alternate energy sources, especi ally pollution from coal, are particularly acute already. Li articulates a three step program: 1. (2006-2010) Speed up the domestic MFE program a) Establish good tokamak(EAST, HL-2M) research facilities b) Starting R&D and construction of ITER -CN packages c) The basic plasma science and education; d) Start Demo-like reactor design and material program e) Start key technologies for ITER 2. (2011-2020) Establish solid domestic MFE base a) Advanced scientific program of tokamak research b) Join ITER construction and H-operation c) Training young scientists and engineers d) Master the full technology for ITER-type machine. e) Some key R&D technologies for Demo 3. (2021-2040) Fast Track for Demo constr uction by international cooperation or independent development a) Demo design (physical simulation, engineering design) 154b) Full R&D for Demo c) Demo construction Three major new facilities are contemplated in the plan. FDS-I A fusion-fission hybrid whose goals woul d be to transmute ra dioactive wastes and produce fissile fuel. It is intended to be an early application of fusion. The machine would have a major radius of 4 m and pr oduce 150 MW of fusion power, with Q~3. FDS-ST A Spherical tokamak based reactor which would serv e the role of a CTF in the Chinese program. It would test technologi es for tritium breeding, H2 production and transmutation of radioactive wastes. The machin e is envisioned to have a major radius of 1.4 m and produce 150 MW of fusion power at Q~5. FDS-II A fusion power test reactor, with a missi on similar to that of Demo in the US or EU programs. Its goals include electricit y generation at high thermal efficiency and power density. The machine would have a major radius of 6 m and produce 2500 MW of fusion power with a Q~30. Fusion-fission hybrids are apparently of interest to help provide fuel for fission plants which would otherwise limit total nuclear pow er to 10-15% of that required for the Chinese economy. Otherwise, the plan laid out, is similar in outline and schedule to that of the US and EU. International cooperation is an important elem ent of the plan (especially in its early stages). 3.e.6 Alternate Approaches For Fusion Development As noted above, this report focuses on \"m ain-line\" program elem ents supporting an ITER-Demo path. In this context, alternat e concepts help validate fusion science, provide risk mitigation and represent possibl e improvements for following generations of fusion plants. The panel also heard from several community members who advocated fission-fusion hybrids as an alternate approach or interim step with re spect to pure fusion systems. The panel felt that this class of devices were out side the scope of our charge. This issue was taken up several years ago by the FESAC panel on non-electric fusion applications, but not dealt with in any de pth because the demand for fission power at the time was perceived to be small [1.10]. It may be that, due to concerns over global warming, the situation has changed and this option for fusion may deserve further attention. 155 Chapter 4 Analysis of Gaps 4.a. Approach As the set of broad questions was developed in response to the first part of the charge, considerable detail was amassed concerning the scientific and technical issues which will need to be addressed and the ex trapolation required from the current state of knowledge. These finer scale issues were considered in light of existing and planned programs and a fine-granularity se t of gaps was compiled. This list represents gaps in our knowledge that are likely to remain, with some reasonabl e probability, even after completion of the research program which is currently underway or in the pipeline. Of course it is not possible to predict with certainty, the results of scientific research, so this assessment represents only the best guesse s and judgments of the panel. For each fine-scale gap, we propose one or mo re measures which could be undertaken to fill the gap. These \"mission elements\" are re search activities of various types, which would provide the technical information requ ired, build confidence in our ability to analyze the complex physical systems invol ved and point toward solutions supporting practical application of fusion energy. In the following chapter, mission elements are combined into major initiatives, facilities or programs each of which, typically, would fill a number of the fine-scale gaps described here. 4.b. Compilation of fine-scale gaps and mission elements For each issue, identified in chapter 2, the fi ne-scale gaps are listed and described. In each case the bulleted lists following the desc ription of the gap are the proposed mission elements. 4.b.1.Measurement a. Gap: Sufficient measurement capability to va lidate predictive fusion science and to provide a reliable data stream for all necessary plasma control. Mission elements: Develop and employ diagnostics for low-neutron facilities Upgrade the diagnostic set for ITER b. Gap : Measurement compatibility with the nuc lear environment of Demo. Issues to resolve include sensor surviv ability and new techniques that are consistent with the 156auxiliary systems likely to be available. New measurements for analyzing the plasma- boundary interface and accounting for tritium will be required. Mission elements: Test nuclear-capable dia gnostic techniques on non-nucle ar facilities and ITER Test diagnostic components in a nuclear environment Improve predictive capability to reduce measurement requirements Deploy on future burning plasma experiments (e.g. CTF) c. Gap : In-situ calibration of measurements in the near steady-state nuclear environment of Demo. Issues to resolve in clude gradual changes in optical and electrical diagnostic components, much less \"off-line\" access, an d diagnostic compatibility with remote maintenance. Mission elements: Use long-pulse facilities to develop and test in-situ approaches and procedures 4.b.2. Integration Of High-Performance, Steady-State, Burning Plasmas The integration of high performance, steady- state burning plasmas is comprised naturally of four elements; 1. High performance burning plasma core, 2. Edge and scrape-off plasmas, and 3. Sustainment of magnetic configuration and plasma. 4. Optimization of the plasma configuration High Performance Burning Plasma Core Fusion Gain Extrapolation- Results from experiments over the past 50 year s of fusion research are summarized in the Lawson Diagram [Fig 2.b.2] and categorized according to magnetic configuration and plasma duration. Plasma temperatures in the range required for Demo (T(0) ~ 20 keV) have been obtained routinely by several tokamaks. While not shown explicitly on this figure, plasma densities covering the range (10 20-1021 m-3) have also been obtained in several experiments. The primary challenge has been to obtain the required temperature, density and confinement simultaneously in an integrated manner. A measure for the integration of confinement, temperature and density is the fusion gain (Q = P fusion/Pext-heat ), or the quantity n ET in a non-burning plasma. For short duration plasmas ( E), plasma Q ~ 0.6 was achieved in JET DT and \"equivalent Q DT\" of 0.7 was achieved in JT-60U DD experiments. For modest duration (~ 5 E) plasmas, Q 0.2 was achieved in TFTR and JET DT plasmas and \"equivalent Q DT\" 0.2 in JT-60U DD. For longer duration plasmas, the achieved equivalent Q (or n ET) decreases significantly (see figure 4.b.2.1). ITER will extend this range considerably with successful baseline operation at Q = 10 for 500s. If the upgrades for modest AT ( N 3, f bs 50%) operation are implemented, 157 Fig. 4.b.2.1 Plasma performance vs. pulse length (Kikuchi FT 2-5, 21st IAEA Fusion Energy Conference, Chengdu, China, 2006) ITER is expected to achieve Q = 5 for 3,000 s. Gap in Fusion Gain after ITER - factor of 5 to 10 for steady-state AT operation. Plasma Confinement Extrapolation - Progres s on achieving transport can be assessed by comparing the normalized confinement ,B E, attained versus B E predicted based on empirical scaling . Results from the largest tokamak e xperiments today are within a factor of 3 of the B E required for a Demo plasma, and ITER will span a range in B E beyond the requirements for a Demo. Therefore ITER should provide the capability to test the predictive capabilities of physics based and empirically based models for H-mode based confinement and modest AT modes. Gap in Plasma Confinement after ITER, JT-60SA, KSTAR etc -With a factor ~2 in B E needed for a minimal Demo and a factor ~ 3 for a Demo with AT modes at high N and f bs. Need to clarify the minimum Demo requirements. Fusion Power Density Extrapolation - In addition to high fusion gain, the burning plasma core must produce a significant fusion power density to achieve economic attractiveness. The conceptual studies of fusion power plants [4.b.2.1-3] indicate the need for a fusion power density of 2-5 MWm -3 in the fusion plasma core to produce a neutron wall loading of 1-4 MWm-2 on the first wall of the typical fusion power plant. Analyses of power plant plasmas with typical profiles and impurity c ontent indicate the need for volume averaged plasma pressures, <p>, of ~ 10 atm. The ul timate figure of merit is the maximum <p> that can be produced within the limits on th e maximum magnetic field at the magnet coil fusion = <p>/B coil2. A summary of plasma pressures attained versus the magnetic field at the magnet conductor is shown in Fig 4.b.2.2 for variou s experimental devices compared to that expected from ITER and that required for a Demo plasma. Plasma pressures ~ 1 atm 158 Fig. 4.b.2.2 Plasma pressure vs. magnetic field at the coil. have been achieved for modest durations of several E, a maximum plasma pressure of 1.6 atm has been achieved in Alcator C-Mod for 10 E. ITER is projected to produce plasma pressures of ~ 3 atm (0.5 MWm-3) within a factor of 3 in pressure and an order of magnitude in fusion power density and neutron wall loading of Demo. Gap in fusion power density after ITER - factor of ~10 Consequences of Plasma Instability and Magnetic Asymmetries - When the operational stability limits are violated large scale instab ilities such as disruptions can occur with a range of consequences. Disruptions produce significant heat loads and electromagnetic loads on internal components. While exis ting devices have de veloped designs and operational techniques to mitigate the eff ects of disruptions, the driving forces and consequences will increase for ITER and Demo. Gap in response to Disruptions after ITER -The thermal plasma energy per unit first wall area (W th/Awall) increases by 4.5 in going from J ET to ITER, and a factor of 2.5 in going from ITER to an ARIES-like Demo. Th e poloidal field energy available to drive electromagnetic loads increases by ~18 from JE T to ITER with Demo being slightly less than ITER. Assuming the same materials and geometry, deflections and stresses in mechanical components due to currents indu ced by disruptions increase by a factor of ~2.5 from JET to ITER with Demo ~ the same as ITER. The big st ep in disruption loads is from JET to ITER and the step to Demo is much more modest. The Demo first wall/divertor must be designed to rem ove higher power densities during nominal operation and to breed tritium. Detailed designs are needed to evaluate the impact. The loss of a small fraction of the energetic alpha population due to instabilities or magnetic field asymmetries can produce severe localized heat loads and the possibility of He blisters. This has been observed in present experiments an d techniques are being 159developed to understand the source and mitigate the effects. A new issue is the magnetic asymmetries introduced by the ferromagnetic ma terials being proposed for the first wall and blankets. This issue will be addressed by JT-60SA and by test blanket modules in ITER. Metric: allowed P loss (MW, MWm-2, % of P ) Edge and Scrape-off Plasmas The edge and scrape-off plasma provides the interface between the high temperature of the fusion plasma core and material walls of the vacuum chamber while exhausting the plasma energy and particles (especially alpha ash) at high power densities under steady- state conditions. The parameters of interest in understanding the edge plasma include: T, n the study of edge and scrape-off plasmas beyond existing devices mode stly in power density but will extend durations to several hundred s econds in non-burning plasmas. Since ITER's physical size is ~ Demo, it will provide significant capability to test various plasma edge and scrape- off models. After ITER, the extrapolation to Demo will be largest in particle fluence (several orders of magnitude) and modest (~4) in thermal power density on internal components that must be distributed over the first wall and divertor. Gap in Edge and Scrape-off Plasmas after ITER - factor of 4 increase of exhaust power density, ~10 3 increase in particle fluence and thermal energy per year and duty cycle for maintenance of low tritium retention conditions. Sustainment of the Magnetic Conf iguration and Burning Plasma. Studies of magnetic fusion power plants in dicate the need to operate with high availability over periods of ~ 1 year, Steady-st ate operation is also highly desirable with an approximately factor of tw o benefit in estimated cost of electricity for steady-state operation relative to pulsed operation as in an inductively driven tokamak. The goal in this area is to have the capability of continuous operation for periods of 1 year. Magnetic Configuration Sustainment - The major issues are the cost required to cons truct and operate a reac tor-relevant current drive system, and the robustness of high gain burning plasmas to pr ovide a large fraction of the plasma current in the presence of the strong coupling be tween alpha heating defined plasma pressure profiles, M HD stability and plasma transport. Extrapolation for tokamaks - Existing toka mak experiments have sustained plasma durations of several minutes using inductive drive, and durations over five hours using RF drive. The advanced tokamak (AT) mode of operation, [4.b.2.4, 4.b.2.5], provides high N and a high self-driven bootstrap current , required for continuous high power density operation in a tokamak Demo. This mode of operation and has been adopted for the most advanced JA, US and EU power plan t designs, and is being studied actively on existing tokamaks. The key parameters are given in Table 1. 160 Table 1a Advanced Tokamak Parameters Advanced Tokamaks N 1-fbs (%) 20-30 2.4/3.8 ~8 continuous JT-60U Achieved 2.5 1/3 1.37 23, 12 DIII-D Achieved 4 40 1.6/3.9 1.0 2, 1 DIII-D Goal 5 20 1.5/4.5 1.3 2, 1 C-Mod Goal 3 30 2.4/5 0.8 5, 5 KSTAR Goal 5 10 3.5/7 1.7 300, 60 JT-60SA Goal 3.5 -5.5 30 1.5/5 3.1 100, 5 ITER Scenario 4 Goal 3 50 2.2/5.3 9.2 3000, 7 CR is the plasma current prof ile redistribution time. Experiments have achieved values of N or f bs in a non-burning AT plasmas approaching those required for an advanced Demo. However, the duration on most present experiments is too short for th e current and pressure profiles to evolve to equilibrium. Experiments planned for DIII-D, C-Mod, KSTAR, JT-60SA will extend these regimes to near steady-state conditions and ITER will exte nd these regimes to Demo scale (Ba) and will begin tests with burning plasmas at Q ~5 and moderate fusion power densities. Gap in Magnetic Configuration Sustainment (tokamak) after ITER, JT-60SA, KSTAR, EAST, C-Mod, DIII-D - the gap will be in the integration of a high bootstrap fraction AT with a high-gain burning plasma. The difficulty of this integration increases as the external heating power and current drive power decrease. Using the product of external-heating fraction and externally driven current fraction - f ext-heat x f ext-CD , as a measure of the control available during integration, the ga p is a factor of 20 from ITER to an AT Demo. Magnetic Configuration Sustainment (Stellarator) - The issues for the stellarator are: closure of flux surfaces, energetic particle confinement in non-symmetric geometry, uncertain MHD limits, power and particle removal in 3-D geometry and the complexity and cost of the three dimensional structure. Table 1b Advanced Stellarator Parameters Advanced Stellarators 4.4 9.7 1.8 0.05, ~0.01 W7-AS Achieved 3.5 0.3 - ~10 11 0.375 Extrapolation for Stellarators - The largest stellarator in the world is the superconducting 161LHD in Japan, which has demonstrated high without any disruptions, and sustained operation without any external current drive. Stellarators can operate at much higher densities than similar tokamaks, stabilizing fa st-ion driven instabilities and reducing the edge temperature to ease divertor design. HSX, a small quasi -helically symmetric stellarator is now in on and a medium-size quasi-axisy mmetric compact stellarator, NCSX, is under construction with experimental operations planned for 2012. The larger W-7X stellarator in Germany is expected to begin operation in 2014. These facilities will test the effectiveness of quasi-symmetry in cluding fast particle confinement, plasma transport, limits, MHD stability, particle and energy exhaust including ELM and disruption behavior. Gap in Magnetic Configuration Sustainment (Stellarator) - W-7X will test the properties of non-burning plasmas with modera te parameters in an optimized isodynamic configuration for long pulses. LHD and W- 7X are developing and demonstrating long- pulse power handling in 3D configurations. Th ese large aspect ratio configurations are not favored for a Demo within the US community, due to their large size for a given fusion power. . NCSX will test the prope rties of quasi-axisymmetric configurations, which are predicted to have transport prope rties similar to tokamaks and stability properties of stellarators at moderate plasma parameters. Large gaps will exist in extrapolation to a Demo, which may requir e a QAS stellarator performance extension experiment. Since the confinement propertie s of quasi-axisymmetri c configurations are similar to tokamaks, the burning plasma phys ics should be informed by ITER through the predictive plasma modeling initiative. Plasma Sustainment - The burning plasma fu el mix must be sustained by continual refueling of the plasma core in the presen ce of alpha ash and impurities generated by plasma wall interactions. ITER will provide a major test for the tokamak configuration and demonstration of particle control techniques since it is the roughly the same line density and temperature as a Demo plasma. Gap in Plasma Sustainment - ITER will make a major cont ribution to filling this gap. Remaining issues will include alpha ash and impurity transport for AT plasma profiles and impurity generation at Demo exhaust power densities. Plasma Facing Component Sustainment - The plasma facing components must have erosion lifetimes compatible with continuous operation at high power density in an intense neutron environment for up to one ye ar. The erosion lifetime depends on plasma temperature near the plasma-material interface, on re-deposition of eroded materials and the properties of materials unde rgoing intense neutron irradiation. In addition, the retention of tritium in the PFC components must be much lower (<~0.025%) than present experiments to allow continuous operati on for one year. (See also section XXX) Gap in Plasma Facing Component Sustainment - A large gap will exist in this area particularly for the effects of neutron irradiation on PFC mate rials properties that modify erosion/redeposition and tritium retention. 162Gap in Integration of Strongly Self-heated Plasmas All previous experiments have been carried out with non-burning plasmas or at best a limited number of weakly burning plasmas. Wh ile some aspects of self-heating plasmas can be simulated; the integration of a plasma with strong self-heati ng by energetic alpha particles and alpha ash residue coupled with advanced modes of operation can only be resolved with confidence by actual experimentat ion. ITER will make major contributions in this area, but is limited in the power density and plasma durations that can be produced due to nuclear heating of the superconducting coils. Quantify gap to minimal Demo to advanced Demo. Mission Elements Improve simulation capabilities by improvement s in theory and codes combined with experimental validation on a wide range of devices. Simulate integration of high-performan ce steady-state burning plasmas with non- nuclear facilities Test performance of intrinsically steady- state devices (stellarators) and assess potential for extrapolation to reactor regime Enhance AT capabilities in ITER, mainly by addition of appropriate actuators (heating and current drive) and diagnostics Build a new DT facility References [4.b.2.1] The ARIES Reports are at h ttp://aries.ucsd.edu/ARIES/DOCS/bib.shtml [4.b.2.2] The EU PPCS Report is at http and K.

Predictive modeling Predictive modeling requires the use of large computer codes to address the complexity of actual experimental facilities. These codes will be used to extrapolate DEMO plasma operation from the physics database provided by the large experimental facilities within the world fusion program together with the burning plasma data which will be obtained from ITER operations. The en tire predictive modeling effort will require an extensive program of code verification a nd model validation if it is to serve as a reliable basis for extrapolation to DEMO. Gap: Verification. Code verification is the process by which the fidelity of a numerical algorithm with respect to underlying mathemati cal model is established and the errors in its solution are quantified. It is an exercise in mathematics and computer science. As currently practiced within the US magnetic fusi on community, this exercise is left to the code development groups themselves. Ot her programs (e.g., the Advanced Scientific 163Computing Initiative of Defense Programs) have recognized that the \"best practice\" is to have a neutral third party responsible for both code verification and validation [Oberkampf, 2002]. Funding limitations ha ve prevented the formation of code verification and validation group(s). A minimu m step toward assuri ng that the codes used for predictive modeling are an accura te implementation of the underlying physics model is to require that both the source code and a substantial data base of detailed code results are available to interested scientists. Gap: Validation. Code validation is th e process through which the scientific community comes to accept that a particular model reliably predicts real world behavior. It is an exercise in physics. Magnetic fusion experi ments exhibit a rich variety of phenomena. A complete validation of our predictive modeli ng codes requires that these codes exhibit these same phenomena over the correspondi ng range of plasma parameters. Code validation is a tremendous undertaking, requ iring active collaborati on between the code development groups and the experimental and theoretical communities. In addition to continued support for code development and theo ry, it will require an investment in new experimental diagnostics to enable detail ed comparisons between code results and experiment and substantial amounts of dedicated experimental time. Gap: Turbulence and Transport. A problem specific to tur bulence and transport is the large range of space and time scales which must be dealt with in a successful model of plasma microturbulence. Relevant length sc ales range from the electron gyroradius (~10 - 5m) to plasma equilibrium lengths scales (meters), while the time scales which must be bridged by gyrokinetic models range from electron transit times and characteristic periods of electron-scale turbulence (~10-7s) to the duration of ITER discharges (~103 s). Computational models must be developed which allow us to predict phenomena on macroscopic length and time scales while accurately modeling phenomena which occurs on microscopic length and time scales. Gap: Plasma Edge Turbulence . The development of kine tic codes for studying edge plasma turbulence must be completed, a nd these codes must unde rgo verification and validation. Gap: MHD. Verification and validation of fu lly nonlinear non-ideal MHD codes must be completed along with appropriate tool s for designing feedback control systems required for tokamak operation beyond no-wall plasma pressure limits. Gap: RF wave propagation and absorption. Improved models of RF wave propagation from the antenna through the plas ma edge must be developed to enable accurate estimates of RF antenna loading. Improved models of RF-induced plasma rotation must be developed if RF systems are to fulfill their promise as actuators for systems aimed at controlling plasma profiles. Gap: Comprehensive, multiphysics modeling. The development of a comprehensive model of tokamak plasmas is important because it will be the tool used to guide ITER operation and to extrapolate from ITER to DEMO . If such a model is to provide reliable 164extrapolations it must be based on validated phy sics modules. It is only after the separate models of plasma phenomena described above ma ture and are validated in isolation, they can usefully be combined into such a comprehensive model. Mission Elements Improved diagnostics for existing and planne d devices sufficient for validation of emerging models Enhancements to basic theory to provid e the next generation of physical models Improvements in numerical models and algorithms Computing facilities capable of carryi ng out the production supercomputing required 4.b.4. Control The gaps in research in plasma control are primarily in the area of low power actuator development. In particular, a fusion reactor requires that the energy required for control be a small fraction of the total power from the reactor. This total power requirement should include any inherent inefficiencies in the control actuators themselves. To date, most kinetic control technique s (i.e. control of the plasma pressure, plasma pressure profile, plasma current, plasma current profil e, and to a lesser degree the plasma rotation and rotation profile) have been based on the idea of controlli ng the input of energy to the system so as to affect the quantity of intere st. In a burning plasma to maintain a low re- circulating power fraction, there will be very little energy input to the plasma relative to the plasma self heating. This implies that ex ternal heating, current or rotation drive will be limited, and that the pressure, current and rotation profiles be clos e to a self-consistent solution with only the alpha heating power, boot strap current and plasma transport. Thus, a fortunate coincidence is required in order fo r a tokamak discharge to maintain a steady state in that transport must be consistent with an optimized MHD stable pressure and bootstrap driven current profile and the concomitant alpha heating profile. The need for this coincidence can only be obviated if the profiles of diffusivities or of the heating power itself can be controlled. The two gene ric methods by which this can be achieved are: 1) by control of the species mix and ther efore the local fusion reaction rates, and 2) by control of the profile of the thermal diffusivi ty. 3) In addition, some current drive must be supplied to control the plasma current profile to maintain adequate margin with respect to MHD instabilities. Problems of control diagnostic cap ability are being c overed in the section 4.b.1. This gap analysis relies on the existen ce of a viable method for measuring the species profile and the plasma pressure and current profiles. It also assumes that measurements of plasma magnetic fields and fluxes (or equivalent replacements for boundary determination) are available so that plasma boundary co ntrol is not an issue for Demo. a. Gap : Species mix profile control The primary gap in this area is a viable deep fueling technology for reactor scale plasmas. This issue is discussed in the heating fueling section of this analysis. In 165addition to this primary need, it would then be necessary to demonstrate that this technology could be used to control the species mix profile to the accuracy required for Demo. The exact level of the demonstration would depend on the state of knowledge and the predictive capab ility as well as the ability to localize and aim the fueling that was developed in parallel with this new fueling technology. The ability to control the speci es profile is a generic gap that would benefit all fusion reactor concepts. Mission Elements Develop and test fueling tools Simulate on non-burning plasmas Extend ITER capabilities b. Gap : Diffusivity control The primary method that is envisioned for controlling the profile of the thermal diffusivity in a plasma is indirectly thr ough control of the toroidal rotation profile. Strong sheared toroidal rotation can facilitate a sheared radial el ectric field profile, that has been observed in current machines to suppress ion tur bulence, leading to enhanced confinement in the shear regi on. The most popular method currently in use to induce toroidal rotation is neutral beam injection. Unfortunately, this method does not scale to a reactor plas ma. Alternative methods with a more energetically favorable size scaling fo r inducing plasma rotation would be required in order to implement diffusivity control in a burning plasma. Such a tool would be powerful, in that it could be used to control the energy confinement time, and therefore the fusion heating power. If a mechanism were identified that had the potential for use in this application, control feasibility would need to be demonstrated. The value if this control t echnique is generic and would benefit all toroidal confinement devices that can support sheared toroidal rotation Mission Elements Develop theory and models for flow-drive techniques Test on non-nuclear experiments Extend ITER capabilities c. Gap: Current profile control There are several methods proposed that co uld be used for controlling the current profile in a burning plasma. However, the requirement of energy gain and economics for the reactor system places a severe constrain on the amount of power that can be used for this purpose. For this reason, it is envisioned for axisymmetric devices, such as the ST or AT which get the rotational transform from plasma current, most of this curre nt will come from the bootstrap current. For control purposes, a small amount of ex ternal current drive capability is envisioned to help maintain a stationary operating c ondition and to correct for small deviations from the optimal current profile for MHD stability. However, the exact shape of the bootstrap current profile depends on the shape of the pressure gradient. The pressure profile is in turn determined by the turbulent transport of 166energy, which is not yet understood or pr edictable. Thus, the exact external current drive requirement is not predicta ble and it must be demonstrated that a viable control solution exists for a burning plasma which gets the majority of its rotational transform from pl asma current and the majority of it's plasma current from bootstrap. The plasma current profil e control gap is not generic, as the stellarator concept gets its rotational tr ansform from external non-axisymmetric coils. Mission Elements Develop current-drive techniques Test on non-nuclear experiments Extend ITER capabilities 4.b.5. Off-normal events a. Gap : High-performance operating regimes in tokamaks consistent with Demo requirements that are free of disruptions and other off-normal plasma events (e.g., ELMS), or reliable methods of detecti on and response that allow avoidance or mitigation of plasma events that could ot herwise force a reacto r to shut down for major repairs. Mission Elements Discover high-beta, high-bootstrap-fr action operating regimes on existing or planned tokamaks that are simultaneously free of disruptions, ELMS, and run-away electron events. o Improve understanding of operationa l and disruptive limits in high- performance regimes using theory and modeling validated by experiments. o Improve, develop, and test real -time diagnostics, analysis, and actuators that are capable of maintaining high-performance regimes free of off-normal events, and that will be able to function in the fusion environment of a Demo. Improve understanding of off-normal event development in high performance regimes on existing and planned tokamaks, and develop and validate reliable techniques for controlling or mitigating these events. o Improve theory and modeling of the growth and development of disruptions in high-performan ce regimes, including possible precursors that could be detected reliably in the fusion environment of Demo. o Improve or invent and validate r eal-time diagnostic and analysis techniques for predicting the onset of off-normal events, which will be able to function in th e fusion environment of Demo. 167o Improve or invent and test actuat ors needed to avoid off-normal events or mitigate their impact, using approaches that can be extrapolated for use in the fusion environment of Demo. Test the effectiveness of these newly developed avoidance and mitigation techniques in the burning regime using either an ITER enhanced to operate in high-performance regime s (AT), or using a new DT-burning integrated AT-physics demonstration device. Based on the test results evaluate the potential effectiveness of these avoidance and mitigation techniques in the more demanding fu sion environment of Demo including the requirements for reduced wall armor for tritium breeding, high reliability, and reasonable cost. b. Gap: Sufficient understanding of other confinement configurations with the ability to run without off-normal plasma events. Mission elements Extend the understanding of confinement and other properties of configurations that avoid off- normal plasma events using new performance extension devices. Then assess the potential of these configurations to provide the hi gh-performance regimes and other characteristics required by Demo. 4.b.6. Plasma Modification By Auxiliary Systems a. Gap : Plasma Heating: Even in a high gain plasma, some level of auxiliary plasma heating may be required for start-up, sustainment or instability control. This needs to be achieve d precisely and efficiently. New systems/technologies have to be developed or expanded to meet the requirements of Demo Mission Elements Higher frequency, high unit power, and higher efficiency microwave sources (gyrotrons) need to be developed for Electron Cyclotron Heating. EC Launching mirrors will have to be developed that minimize erosion and to handle the higher ne utron and heat fluxes of Demo. The decreased ICRF coupling with large antenna-plasma gaps could be addressed by an improved understa nding of RF wave coupling to plasmas. o Or develop alternate antenna conf igurations, which have higher antenna-plasma gap tolerance. To penetrate the higher density plasmas envisioned for Demo, higher energy neutral beam injectors will need to be developed. b. Gap: Plasma Current Drive: For steady-st ate operation the plasma current will have to be produced in a non-pulsed (non- inductive) manor, and owing to the low 168current drive efficiencies of most non-inductive means, a high fraction of internally generated current (bootstrap current) is desirable. However, high performance plasmas, with high bootstra p currents are very susceptible to instabilities, where tearing modes create zones of zero or low bootstrap current. Mission Elements Higher frequency, high unit power, and higher efficiency microwave sources (gyrotrons) need to be developed for Electron Cyclotron Heating. EC Launching mirrors will have to be developed to minimize erosion and to handle the higher ne utron and heat fluxes of Demo. To localize RF current drive there is a need to improve the understanding of RF wave coupling to plasmas o Or develop alternate antenna configurations, which have improved current drive directivity. Alternate launcher concepts for Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD), need to be validated for effectiveness and functionality prior to use on Demo. c. Gap : Fueling and Exhaust Control: Opera tion of Demo steady-state for weeks or months at a time, at high fusion pow er production, requires that the fuel concentration in the core of the plas ma be adjustable and renewable. Mission elements Increase the understandi ng of the processes of D-T fuel consumption or loss through transport, or dilution by He ash accumulation. Increase the ability to measure the isotopic mix in the core, enabling the optimization of the fusion performance. Improve the ability to process large quantities of Tritium on a continuous basis. Develop new methods of core fueling. d. Gap: Edge Control: The need to manipul ate the very surface of the plasma, such as is required to inhibit the presen ce of Edge Localized Modes (ELM), or Resistive Wall Modes (RWM), may require coils to be placed relatively close to the plasma, with a wide bandwidth capability. Mission elements Water-cooled coils that can survive the heat and neutron fluence near the plasma boundary will need to be developed. Robust methods of measuring the su rface conditions will need to be developed and tested. Improve understanding of how th e lowering of the plasma edge density and pressure leads to the plasma becoming stable to peeling- ballooning modes, which drives ELMs. 169 Improved understanding of the use of Resonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMP) from a set of correction coils which can produce a toroidal mode n = 3, for the control of edge density. e. Gap: Rotation Control: To optimize plasma confinement in high beta plasmas, edge rotation improves performance by pr oducing radial velocity shear, which acts to stabilize micro-turbulence and th ereby improving plasma confinement. Mission elements Alternate means will need to be implemented to enhance plasma rotation, if the rotation is below the threshold where the radial velocity shear can be effective. Dedicated tangentially oriented neutral beams injection can provide the momentum need for adequate plasma rotation. Plasma poloidal flows can be driven by ICRF waves (primarily Ion Bernstein Waves, IBW). Improved understanding of this process needs to be developed. 4.b.7. Magnets a. Gap: Increased understanding of superconducting magnet systems to allow improved performance, reduced design margins, lowered costs. Mission element Improve and validate, on test stands , models of superconducting magnets: Fundamental understanding must be in creased for coupled processes like mechanical strain, critical field an d current and crack growth to allow design of magnets with improved performance and lower cost. b. Gap: Reduction of frequency and conseque nces of magnet quenches (includes improved diagnostics and modeling) Mission element Improve modeling and diagnostics for detection of quenches in superconducting magnets: To reduce th e frequency and consequences for magnet quenches, particularly in high-temperature superconductors, a research program must test new met hods for improving the sensitivity and reliability of real-time quench detection. c. Gap: Advanced fabrication techniques fo r high temperature superconductors to improve performance and to reduce cost (power) and complexity of the cryogenic cooling systems. Mission elements Test designs for high-temperature superconducting magnets suitable for fusion: The understanding of fa brication and performance of high- 170temperature superconductors must be improved and tested in the laboratory. Deploy high-temperature superconducting magnets on new or upgraded confinement experiments: Successful laboratory tests of these magnets should be followed up by developmen t of techniques for industrial fabrication and field tests on ma gnetic confinement experiments. d. Gap: Electrical and thermal Insulators capable of withstanding the nuclear environment Mission elements Improve computational models of the basic materials properties subject to intense fusion neutron bombardment. Conduct research using neutron and other radiation sources to qualify insulator materials. e. Gap: Magnets consistent with overall system maintainability Mission elements Conduct research into design and fa brication of superconducting magnets with demountable joints: The prospect for building such magnets must be investigated by testing innovative approaches, for example the deposition of high-temperature superconducting mate rial directly onto structural plates. Deploy superconducting magnets with demountable joints on new or upgraded experiments: Successful laboratory tests of such magnets can be followed by field testing on ma gnetic confinement experiments. 4.b.8. Plasma-Wall Interactions Overall Gap: Sufficient understanding of plasma-wall interactions to predict the environment for and behavior of plasma facing and other internal components for Demo conditions. ITER will provide extensive information on th e response of plasma facing walls to long pulse high power plasmas including tritium re tention and transport in materials. Long pulse non-DT machines such as KSTAR, JT- 60SC, and EAST will supplement the ITER data with even longer integrated plasma e xposure time but without neutron irradiation effects. Successful completion of these experime nts will still leave a significant that must be filled before Demo can be licensed as a nuclear facility. Because of the significant increase in availability (plasma operating time versus wall clock time) and the much greater tritium usage rate on Demo, it will be necessary to have a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting both the edge plasma conditions and the response of the plasma facing material to the fusion plasma . In order to achieve the required accuracy several interrelated aspects of plasma wall in teractions must be accurately measured and 171physical models constructed that can be used for extrapolation to Demo. These aspects include: a. Gap: Characterization of Scrape-Off-La yer (SOL) turbulence and transport including ions, neutrals and impuriti es in the edge plasma region. While simulation models such as UEDGE can be used to match several features of the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) plasma in fusion devices, these codes have many free parameters which are set to match the data but are not based on first principles. New phenomena have been added to the models, but the number of free parameters has also in creased. Edge plasma properties for ITER are being calculated using a ra nge of the free parameters found on existing machines. Since ITER and Demo are likely to be similar in size, information gained from ITER operation is likely to be applicable to Demo. A strong modeling effort to understand th e physics of the SOL is needed to increase confidence in predictions for Demo. b. Gap: Understanding of non-plasma effect s such as radiation transport in optically thick plasma or neut ral effects in dense plasma. One of the strategies for managing the pow er density in the divertor in Demo is to use a combination of high density operation and impurity injection in the divertor to radiate power to a larger area than energy c onduction in the SOL would allow. Such an operating mode fo r the divertor creat es a region where both the photon mean free path and the neutral particle mean free path are short compared to the size of the regi on. The usual fluid models of the SOL are not appropriate for such a region. Coupling of a model that works for optically thick dense plasma with the conventional SOL codes is needed for Demo. c. Gap: Strategies to mitigate impurity generation associated with RF sheath production. Radio Frequency heating is preferred fo r Demo because the large ports needed for neutral particle heat ing would allow neutron flux and tritium to spread over a much larger volume. It is observed on many fusion devices that RF heating can generate hot spots on n earby plasma facing components. Those hot spots can be sources of impurities that can enter the core plasma and ruin confinement. The mechanisms responsible for such hot spot s are not clearly understood. ITER will utilize RF heati ng and may provide important data for Demo if proper diagnostic s are installed. Additiona l phenomena need to be added to plasma edge codes and calibrated against observations to allow prediction of Demo conditions. d. Gap: Quantitative understanding of pr ocesses which generate impurities Basic processes such as sputter eros ion and evaporation are well understood through both experiment and modeling. In a fusion device se veral synergistic effects are present that greatly co mplicate the understanding of impurity 172generation and how those impurities are transported to and from the core plasma. For example, fusion devices us e mixed PFC materials and have very high particle flux. Laboratory simulati on devices (e.g., PISCES) used to study impurity generation can achieve the particle flux but their plasmas are typically not true Maxwellian distributions at the temperature typical for a fusion device. Mixed materials are just be ginning to be studied in laboratory devices. Measurements in fusion expe riments are difficult because edge plasma conditions are spatially and temporally varying and the ability to remove test articles after exposure is limited. Plasma operating time is rarely dedicated to studying edge plasma phys ics and studies must be done in conjunction with other experiments th at may vary parameters more than would be ideal for impurity generation studies. It is unlikely ITER will dedicate more time to impurity generation studies. Improved laboratory simulation and modeling is the most likely path to success. e. Gap: Characterization of processes that lead to tritium retention Experience from the two DT fusion devices has shown that tritium retention can be quite high (10- 50%). Laboratory experiments and similarity experiments on DD devices have show n much lower values but those experiments have much large uncertainty due to different operating conditions. ITER will be the first device that has significant neutron fluence on PFCs. Neutron radiation damage occurs thr oughout the thickness of materials and creates sites where T can be retained. The synergistic effects of high plasma particle flux and neutron damage have never been studied. It will be very important to study specimens from ITER and measure T retention. However, ITER has no plans for installing easily removable wall samples. Mission Elements Improved theory and computer models for SOL Validation using ITER and non-nuc lear experiments, including significant improvements in edge diagnostics and experimental time Modeling of ion transport and redeposition including dust generations and modification of PFC surfaces. Detailed studies of RF sheath form ation and impurity generation using improved computer models and experimental tests. Study of sputtering, chemical erosion and evaporation in devices with mixed material PFCs Improved modeling of first-wall s ubstructure and its influence on tritium retention Tests on new or existing very-long pulse devices Tests on devices with high neutron fluence 1734.b.9. Plasma Facing Components Overall Gap for Solid PFCs : Understanding of the propert ies of low activation solid materials, joining technologies and cooling strategies suffici ent to design robust first-wall and divertor components in a high heat flux, steady-state nuclear environment. Since Demo will be a nuclear reactor, it will have to meet all the licensing requirements typically applied to fission reactors. All processes needed to manufacture components and structures will have to pass rigorous quality control and assurance inspections. Extensive testing of components will be re quired to show that failure modes are understood and accounted for in the design and that reliability has been demonstrated. Since Demo will be the first ever fusion r eactor and first of a kind components will be utilized, the amount of supporting testing will be greater than for fission reactors that have extensive operating experience. The few long pulse fusion devices all use wa ter cooling for PFCs. ITER and other long pulse machines under construction also plan to use water cooled PFCs. However, most Demo concepts assume high temperature helium gas cooled PFCs and several major developments are needed. The starting point is new refractory metal alloys that have adequate thermal conductivity and resistance to neutron damage. Innovative helium gas cooled heat sink designs must be developed that can remove the heat flux predicted for Demo with sufficient thermomechanical marg in. Reliable methods for joining the plasma facing material to the heat sink in the neut ron environment of Demo must be discovered. Finally, the tritium retention characteristics of these components must be measured. Gap: Identification and qualification of mate rials which can take the survive the heat loads and survive damage from neutron fluence: Tungsten is the lowest ac tivation refractory metal th at has adequate thermal properties to be used as a PFC for De mo. Pure tungsten has a high ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT incr eases with neutron irradiation), and it is difficult to fabricate. There is one sma ll research effort in Japan that has had success in improving ductility through na no-particle alloying with TiC. Similar techniques have been shown to improve the characteristics of Mo alloys. There is a need for a much larger effort to invent a new alloy since a suitable material is the basis for comp onent development. Heat sinks may be constructed from materials other than tungsten but ther e will be higher activation and greater waste disposal issues. Gap: Characterization of welds, brazes or other joining technique that can carry high heat fluxes in the presence of high neutron fluence: Collaborations between the US and Ru ssia have started research on braze materials that can be used to join W to W, or Mo, or Nb. The results are promising but the effort needs to be e xpanded to assure adequate development and testing for Demo. Conventional welding and machining techniques typically do not work w ith refractories because of their high melting points. Development of suitable processes will re quire extensive destructive testing to 174understand the failure mechanisms. F undamental studies of the fracture mechanics of the joints will be needed to develop reliable components. Some of the testing must be done on irradiat ed components to prepare for large scale testing on a Component Test Facility. Gap: Strategies for heat removal with gas coolant at high temperatures while maintaining structural integrity, especial with respect to temperature excursions or other off-normal events: Use of porous metals for high performan ce heat sinks is a rapidly developing field of research. Helium gas cooled porous metal heat sinks (non-refractory) have demonstrated heat removal capability nearly equal to water cooled heat sinks with modest pressure drop and reasonable mass flow rate. Techniques for manufacturing refractory porous metal structures exist and are being used to prepare gas cooled heat sinks for h eat flux testing. These experiments are being done on a small scale and slowly because of funding limitations. The development of reliable water cooled h eat sinks for ITER took about ten years with a large international collaborati on and sufficient funding. The existing level of world-wide effort will not complete this task in 35 years. Gap: Characterization of tritium effects including permeation, embrittlement and retention: Tritium permeation rates increase strongly with increasing operating temperature. Since overall thermal efficiency increases with operating temperature, most Demo designs call for operation at around 1000 C. Strategies such as double walled pipes must be used to collect tritium permeating through PFC coolant feed pipes. Development of such systems is also needed for breeding bl ankets. Some materials be ing considered for heat sinks (e.g., Nb and V) have an affinity for hydrogen atoms. Absorption of H in such materials generally causes embrittle ment. If such materials are used for PFC, a strategy for limiting absorption must be developed. Permeation barriers seem to work well in the ab sence of neutron irradiation, but development is needed for nuclear applications. The commercial reactor production of tritium program is conduc ting research on this topic but the results are classified. Mission Elements Modeling and validation on test stands Validation of designs on nuclear and non-nuclear confinement experiments Qualify materials with high-fluenc e neutron bombardment including fission and accelerator sources Conduct research on tritium effects on test stands Test components on nuclear test stands Qualify components with high-fluence fusion device (CTF) 175Overall Gap for Liquid PFCs : Knowledge base for utilizing liquid surface first-walls, including plasma interacti ons and magnetic effects. The high-risk high-reward alternative to solid PFCs in Demo is free surface liquid PFCs. Liquid surface PFCs are just beginning to be te sted on fusion machines. Initial results are promising but the understanding of several phenomena must be improved before the results can be extrapolated to larger longer pulse machines. These include magnetohydrodynamic modeling of moving conducting liquids in spatially and temporally varying magnetic fields, control of the flowing liquid, and helium particle pumping. Liquid surface PFCs eliminate all of the delete rious effects of neutron irradiation and particle erosion as limitati ons on the lifetime of the com ponents. Liquid Lithium has the added benefit of strongly pumping hydrogen. Si nce the liquid is also the heat removal medium, heat removal capabilities can exceed thos e of solid heat sinks by at least a factor of five for reasonable liquid flow velocities. The difficulty of liquid surface PFCs is the interaction between moving conducting liquids and the fusion machine magnetic fields. The currents induced in the flowing liquid inte ract with the magnetic fields and generate forces that can severely distort the liquid surface (even to the point of injecting liquid drops into the plasma). Time varying magnetic fields in a fusion device can also cause such distortion of the liquid. Gap: liquid compatibility with structures All of the liquid metals being considered for fusion machines (Li, Sn, In, and Ga) react strongly with solid materials that could be used for pipes, nozzles and pumps. Research is needed to determin e if coatings or alloys exist that are compatible with flowing liquids in fu sion devices at the desired operating temperatures. Methods are needed to cr eate openings in the liquid for vacuum pumping, plasma diagnostics, or RF heating. Gap: techniques to control mass flow - ef fects of moving conduc tors in magnetic field Magnetic levitation or stirring of molten metals is used extensively in preparation of special alloys or crysta l growth. There is a large capability for modeling magnetic effects on liquid me tals at low magnetic field and/or velocity. The extension of the models to high field and/or velocity has proved to be a very difficult problem because the thickness of the boundary layers becomes very small compared to the system size. Development of suitable magnetohydrodynamic models is in progr ess but being limited by available funding. Experiments to validate the models are being conducted in a few laboratories but the facilities have limite d capability because of funding limits. Model development is required to design liquid PFCs for fusion devices. Model development is setting the pace of application on fusion machines. Gap: assessment of evaporation and impurity generation into plasma 176Experiments have determined that partic le flux increases the evaporation rate of liquids near the melting point. The tr ansport of evaporated liquid atoms to the plasma is uncertain because of i ssues discussed in the Plasma Wall Interaction section. Since the evaporat ed atoms are easily ionized near the liquid surface, evaporation lowers the sheath potential and can lead to thermal run-away because of the greater m obility of plasma electrons. This phenomenon has never been studied in a fusion device. The exact temperature limits on liquid are uncertain because of these uncertainties. Gap: strategies for helium pumping While some liquid metals are known to aggressively pump hydrogen, all liquid metals have low solubility and high diffusivity for helium. Some calculations have shown that helium might form bubbles in the liquid at high particle flux. If the liquid is rem oved from the fusion device before the bubbles can float to the surface, helium could be pumped by a flowing liquid surface. There has been no experimental observation of this capability. In the absence of such a mechanism, conven tional vacuum pumping techniques must be used for helium ash control. This im plies the need to create openings in the flowing liquid surface for access to pumping ducts. Only sketches of such systems have ever been made. Mission Elements Research on liquid target plat es and modules on non-nuclear confinement experiments Modeling and validation on test sta nds especially on MHD effects on free-surface liquids Develop strategies and designs for extending coverage to all high heat- flux areas Test components on nuclear test stands Qualify components with high-fluence fusion device (CTF) 4.b.10. Internal components Overall gap: tools and capability to design RF antennas and launchers, control coils, final optics and any other in-vessel diagnostic equipment to deliver at high reliability the desired functional performance during ex tended operation in a nuclear plasma environment. ITER, together with long-pulse non-DT mach ines such as KSTAR, JT-60SC, and EAST, will provide the impetus to develop high-performance, active in-vessel components for heating, control and diagnostic components, a nd will also provide data and experience on the performance of these com ponents in an environment of high fluxes of heat, particle, electromagnetic radiation, and neutrons for periods of the order of thousands of seconds. 177Going beyond these experiments towards a D-T DEMO reactor requires extrapolation from these experimental components to desi gns that are fully-qualified for long service life (~years) in a nuclear power environmen t in which the fluxes are 3-5 times greater than those in ITER. Gaps : a. Validated techniques for predicting pa rticle, heat, and neutron fluxes on passive components (e.g. sens ors, mirrors, etc) in re alistic geometry in both normal and off-normal operating conditions. b. Validation of techniques for compu ting heating performance and self- consistent heat and particle fluxes to high-power, energized components (RF antennas, microwave launchers, etc) whic h interact with and alter the edge plasma. c. Qualification of structural, shield and coating materials with which to construct internal components, and a ppropriate joining/bonding technologies. As for other plasma-facing and structur al components, these materials will need to be fully tested to industry stan dards in materials te sting facilities. Mission Elements Modeling and validation on test stands Deploy and test Demo-capable antenna s, LHCD launchers in non-nuclear experiment Validate design approaches on CTF 4.b.11. Fuel cycle Overall Gap: Understanding the elements of th e complete fuel cycle particularly tritium breeding and retention in vessel components. ITER will be the first opportunity to measur e the capability of breeding blankets in an actual fusion environment. Many institutions have been planning for installation of Test Blanket Modules (TBM) on ITER for several y ears, however, TBM are not yet officially part of the ITER project. Design studies and laboratory e xperiments have shown that there are several inte rrelated effects that must be understood before reliable tritium breeding blankets can be developed for Demo. Gap: strategies for high-efficiency breed ing (TBR>1), choice of liquid or solid breeding material, basic thermal-hydraulic design The nuclear cross-sections for tritium breeding are accurately known. Solid breeders have the issues of tritium transport within the breeder, thermal and neutron induced sintering (densification) of the breeder, and heat transfer in the blanket. Liquid breeders have the i ssues of corrosion, MHD pressure drop, 178and tritium permeation. Flibe (Lithiu m and beryllium fluoride mixture) requires composition control because of the possibility of forming free fluorine or TF both of which are highly corrosive. Only laboratory experiments have been done on either t ype of breeder. Combined effects are poorly studied and understood. The ITER TBM is the first opportunity to study integrated effects and measur e generation rates under realistic conditions. The size and neutron fluence limitations on ITER force the need for tests on larger components and at higher fluence between ITER and Demo. Gap: materials for breeding modules capable of maintaining structural integrity at high temperature in presence of large neutron fluence There is an extensive effort to devel op ferritic steel alloys suitable for fusion blanket structures and s ubstantial progress has been made in developing high- temperature capable alloys. Testing of the new alloys ha s shown that the properties are compatible with the fusion neutron environment. Studies of manufacturing processes needed for blanket modules is in progress. Vanadium alloy development has been set aside under constrained budgets because of poorly developed US infras tructure for manufacturing refractory alloys and limitation of V alloys to only Li self-cooled blanket concepts. Silicon carbide development is in an early stage and it is too early to tell if the material will be suitable for blanket structures. (See the materials section for more details.) Gap: tritium permeation must be controlled in high temperature blankets In solid breeder blankets the tritium is swept out of the blanket with helium gas which also cools the blanket. A lternative systems have two separate systems for tritium and heat removal. De mo studies all indicate the desire to operate at temperatures near 1000 C. Permeation of tritium through the coolant or tritium removal pipes can be quite large at such temperatures. One potential solution is to use double walled pipes with helium sweep gas between the pipes, but this is complic ated. Another potential solution is to apply a permeation barrier inside the pipe. Permeation barriers apparently work well in the absence of neutron irradiation, but development is needed for nuclear applications. The commercial re actor production of tritium program is conducting research on this topic but the results are clas sified. For liquid breeder systems, the liquids being cons idered all have low solubility for tritium except for liquid Li. They all have the same permeation issues at elevated temperature. Tritium trappe d in liquid Li ha s to be removed chemically (see below). Gap: recovery and separation of tritium with high throughput Demo requires tritium processing th at exceeds the ITER requirements by a factor or 2-4. Experience in the chemical industry s hows that such a scale-up in throughput takes 5-10 years. This s hould be able to be done between ITER and Demo. However, facilities to conduct testing with specific breeder systems do not exist. The only US fusi on tritium system has a 0.5 g limit. 179Removal of contaminants from the T c ontaining gas stream is much easier for the blanket system than for the vessel pumping system. Chemical techniques for removing T from Li have been publ ished. Scaling th ose processes to Demo size is as discussed above. Gap: Tritium retention in all components Because of neutron damage to materials, it is impossible to prevent tritium retention in breeder materials. Through a combination of temperature control and design features including permeation ba rriers it is likely tritium inventory can be controlled. Testing of such techniques should first be done on the laboratory scale and then on a Component Test Facility. Mission Elements Modeling and validation on test stands Exploit fission reactor and other f acilities to test breeder concepts Research on tests stands for exploring chemistry issues as well as physical extraction and separation Prepare for and participate in ITER TBM Validate models and qualify com ponents with high-fluence fusion device (CTF) 4. b.12. Power extraction Power extraction is a fundamental challenge for an attractive fusion energy source. The scientific issues encountered in fusion power extraction are substantially different that other energy sources including fission. Exampl es of these unique attributes include: a. a very high surface heat flux and pot entially high peaking factors, b. a complex volumetric heating sour ce involving both plasma products (neutrons, particle, and radiation) as well as nuclear reaction in the power extraction components, c. strong impact of electromagnetic field (both static and dynamic) on heat transfer, d. large temperature and stress gradients which can derive a multitude of complex physical phenomena, e. compatibility with the fuel cycle (tritium production and extraction), f. complex geometry, and g. an evolving material properties (e .g., due to radiation effects). In addition the power extraction component s are inherently c oupled to plasma performance (e.g., plasma-material interaction on the first wall and dive rtor), as well as the power conversion cycle and safety. The res earch in this area to date has been mainly limited to concept exploration and some singl e-effect experimentation. There is a fundamental need to develop the engi neering science of power extraction 180Mission Elements: Simulation and bench-top experiments to understand single-effect phenomena (fluid dynamics, heat transfer, MHD eff ects, life-limiting phenomena, permeation, embroilment, tritium retention, corrosion, ...) Partially-integrated tests on non-nuclear f acilities to uncover s ynergetic effects. Test-article and partially integrated test on fission reactors. Integrated test on high-fluence facility such as CTF. 4.b.13. Materials The overarching gap is lack of knowledge of the potential behavi or of a host of functional and structural materials in the fusion energy environment, where the presence of intense gamma ray and high energy neutron fluxes along with high heat fluxes, tritium, high temperature coolants, and in many cases high mechanical stresses creates a uniquely hostile operating environment w ith no existing appropriate fu sion-relevant test bed to develop and qualify suitable materials. Gap: Predictive multiscale models of materials behavior in the fusion environment Mission elements Development of multiscale materials modeling initiative. The main goal of this initiative would be to transform the materials science basis that will enable discovery of new high performa nce materials with tailored properties for the harsh fusion environment. A ma jor focus of this initiative should investigate improved methodologies to accurately and efficiently pass information between comput ational models at different length and time scales, including new computational algor ithms to improve the current computationally expensive atomistic models that currently limit atomistic simulations to 100-1000 atoms (order N 6 for quantum chemistry models and N3 for density functional theory using the low density approximation, where N is the number of electrons in the system) Exploration of new reduced-activation material formulations tailored for superior performance in the fusion environment (including low decay heat and low long-term induced radioactivity) . This will involve utilization of commercial computational thermodynamics codes as well as atomic- and meso-scale models developed in the FSP- scale materials modeling initiative. Analysis of magnetic perturbations of th e plasma from ferritic steels. A higher fidelity analysis is needed to quantify the effect of magnetic perturbations introduced by the ferromagnetic ferritic steel structure on the stability and control of the plasma under ignition and burn conditions. This could perhaps be included as a stand-alone subtask within an FSP-style materials modeling initiative. 181Gap: Constitutive mechanical properties of st ructural and breeding blanket materials in the fusion environment Mission elements Effects of fusion-relevant irradia tion on the mechanical properties of structural materials. The simultaneous presence of high neutron fluxes and transmutant He, H and other solutes in materials irradiated in the fusion reactor environment is expected to cause enhanced hardening and loss of ductility compared to fission reactor conditions, and degradation in fracture toughness is also anticipated. Coordi nated high-fidelity models and experimental validation are needed to develop physically realistic constitutive equations for the mechanical behavior of structural materials under fusion irradiation conditions. The new models will need to consider both bulk hardening effects associated with the formation of nanoscal e radiation defect clusters as well as segregation of minor solute elements to grain boundaries and other interfaces that can lead to lo calized premature fracture. Mechanical deformation time scales ranging from dynamic (~ms) to creep conditions (years) need to be investigated. Both monolithic materials as well as joints (between similar and dissimilar materials) need to be investigated. For experimental validation, continued use of fission reactor irradiations as well as a fusion-relevant irradiation source such as IFMIF or perhaps a tailored spallation neutron irradiation facility is needed. Effects of fusion-relevant irradiation on the sintering behavior and properties of tritium breeding and neutron multiplier materials. The mechanical behavior of breeder materials histor ically has been less studied compared to structural materials, including lithium-containi ng ceramics and beryllium compounds. A science-based approach to the sintering behavior of ceramic breeder pellets is needed to develop an accurate thermomechanical model of the integrated thermal conductivity and tritium release characteristics of the pebble bed concept. For experimental validatio n, continued use of fission reactor irradiations as well as a fusion-relevant irradiation source such as IFMIF or perhaps a tailored spallation neutr on irradiation facility is needed. Gap: Dimensional and phase stability and physical property degradation of materials in the fusion environment Mission elements Modeling and experimental validation of void swelling, irradiation creep and phase stability under fusion irradiation conditions. It is anticipated based on a limited number of ion beam irradiati on studies and fledgling void swelling theory that the swelling resistance of the current leading fusion structural materials will be insufficient in the fusion environment due to swelling enhancement effects associated with the presence of He and H transmutant atoms. The effect of fusion irradiation conditions on the phase stability of structural materials is at an early stage of understanding, although H and He are expected to modify the radiation i nduced segregation behavior of solute 182atoms. Improved understanding of the underlying physical phenomena that control void swelling, irradiation cr eep, and phase stability under fusion reactor conditions will enable the deve lopment of new nanoscale-engineered structural materials with superior perf ormance. For experimental validation, continued use of fission reactor irradi ations as well as a fusion-relevant irradiation source such as IFMIF or perhaps a tailored spallation neutron irradiation facility is needed. Effect of the fusion irradiation environment on thermal conductivity degradation mechanisms. The thermal c onductivity is an important parameter for materials in a number of fusion sy stems, ranging from the structural materials to ceramic breeders to materials for plasma heating and diagnostics. Although it is generally know n that neutron irradiati on causes a degradation in thermal conductivity of materials due to formation of defect clusters and precipitates that cause deleterious s cattering of the heat transport quanta (typically, electrons and phonons in metals and nonmetals, respectively), current models only provide qualita tive predictions. A physically robust quantitatively predictive model of th ermal conductivity degradation in the fusion environment is needed. For experi mental validation, continued use of fission reactor irradiations as well as a fusion-relevant irradiation source such as IFMIF or perhaps a tailored spallation neutron irradiation f acility is needed. Effect of the fusion irradiation environm ent on optical and electrical resistivity degradation mechanisms. The accuracy of several plasma diagnostic and control systems relies on knowing the el ectrical conductivity and optical properties of the constituent material s. Irradiation typically produces pronounced degradation in both the opt ical transmission and electrical resistivity of nonmetals. An impr oved understanding of radiation induced conductivity, radiation indu ced electro-motive forces , and optical property degradation is needed, particularly in cases where the current best available radiation-resistant optical materials are not sufficient for prolonged use in a fusion reactor. For experimental valida tion, continued use of fission reactor irradiations as well as limited testing in a fusion-relevant irradiation source such as IFMIF or perhaps a tailored spa llation neutron irradiation facility is needed. Gap: Science basis for robust high temp erature structural design criteria Mission elements Development of a science-based methodology for safe operation of structural materials in a high temperature neutron irradiation environm ent. The licensing methodology currently used by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission for light water fission reactors is limited to moderate temperatures (~300 oC). The methodology used by governing engineeri ng bodies such as ASME for safe operation of structures at high temperat ure is based on empirical testing of multiple products of a given material. This results in a costly and lengthy process to requalify any material when a minor compositional change is made, and inherently suppresses the developmen t of new high-performance materials. 183In particular, long-term mechanical fa tigue, thermal creep and creep-fatigue tests (at different hold times and cyclic stress amplitudes) are currently required for any new high temperature stru ctural material. Considering that fusion does not yet know what specific chemical formulation will be used for the structural materials in future fusion power plants, there is a clear advantage to develop an improved science-based method for qualifying structural materials for high temper ature operation. A better fundamental understanding of the physical phenomena that control the mechanical behavior of structural materials at elevated temperatures is needed, particularly synergistic effects when multiple deformation processes (e.g., thermal creep and cyclic mechanical fatigue) are present. Most of the experimental validation can be perfo rmed on unirradiated materials. A few confirmatory tests on irradiated materials will also need to be performed using fission neutron, IFMIF, or perhaps spallation neutron source irradiated materials. Gap: Chemical compatibility of materials in the fusion environment Mission elements Improve the scientific basis for chemical dissolution of solid materials exposed to high temperature coolants, w ith and without irradiation. The role of coolant velocity, chemical solubility in the coolant and other engineering factors on chemical dissolution are ge nerally understood. However, the resulting fitted equations of experime ntal data often contain contradictory predictions due to the inappropriate grouping of data that are controlled by different physics/chemical phenomena. An improved understanding of the underlying processes, leading to a \"ch emical dissolution mechanism map\" would be very useful for the developm ent of quantitative predictive models. For the case of molten salt coolants, radiolysis events in the coolant produced by ionizing radiation can cause accel erated corrosion due to production of highly corrosive chemical ra dicals (e.g., HF or free fluorine). For liquid metal and helium gas coolants, the effect of radiation on the corrosion process is secondary in that the effect is main ly associated with radiation induced segregation processes in the bulk material. Understand the controlling phenomen a involving chemical compatibility between adjoining solid materials, incl uding the role of ra diation enhanced diffusion. Gap: Fabrication and joining of complex structures Mission elements Development of high-fidelity joining t echniques for fusion-relevant materials and geometries. Based on a broad exis ting industrial experience base for joining of materials, it is understood that the most appropriate joining conditions are dependent on material, pr oduct form (e.g., joining of thin foil often requires entirely different tec hniques compared to plate or thick 184sections), and service application (e.g., design stress at the joint, exposure to coolant, etc.). However, these joini ng conditions are typically developed as the result of a lengthy trial and error pr ocess, being largel y dependent on the skill and knowledge of the lead welding engineer. The applicability to complex fusion structures of recently developed joining techniques such as friction stir welding and advanced ultr asonic joining processes should be assessed. The mechanical and physical properties of the joints, including effects of irradiation using fission re actors, IFMIF, or perhaps spallation neutron sources, need to be evaluated. 4.b.14. Safety and environment DEMO will be a bridge between fusion sp ecific safety considerations and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) type fission power plant safety regulation and licensing. ITER will validate design approaches and can demonstrate early lifetime reliability for fusion components at low dose (~0.3 dpa). Th e NRC is moving from the traditional worst case safety assessment to a probabilistic risk based safety approach. Since the nature of fusion hazards is different in type and magnitude compared to fission, we need to take advantage of those differences to avoid unnecessarily onerous regulations for fusion. For example, fusion safety should not depend on th e components closest to the plasma (first wall or blankets), but should de pend on engineered safety systems, e.g., vacuum vessel, cryostat, or building systems. The ITER safe ty strategy is based on such systems. Successful ITER operation will provide data for DEMO safety documentation and demonstrate the approach is viable. Never the less, several additional developments are needed for DEMO to be granted a license to operate. Gap: Component qualification Components for use in DEMO must be qualified to validate the design and demonstrate safety roles of key componen ts are satisfied. Integrated testing of components in a high fluence fusion environment is needed to gather the data needed for component qualification. The da ta gathered will guide the choice of design codes (e.g., ASME section III or section VIII) used for fusion components. Simple acceptance of fission based codes is likely to lead to unacceptable restrictions on operations or unnecessary e xpense to meet safety margins that are not needed for fusion systems. DEMO designers need to develop what makes sense, demonstrate that the rules to be used are prudent, identify exceptions, and justify them. Data from an integrated com ponent test facility will be essential for this process. Gap: Safety Analysis and Source Terms The US Fusion Safety Program has de veloped a series of system level computational tools to anal yze the response of a fusion system to an off-normal event of accident. The underlying databa se needed to characterize the fusion radiological source term that could be mob ilized is being gathered. Both the tools and the database will be improved by ITER operation, however it is likely that a thermal hydraulics transient test facility will be needed to validate key models 185prior to a DEMO. This facility would not need to be full-scale, but could be a thermal hydraulically scaled divertor/blanke t mockup. In particular, if DEMO is envisioned to include liquid metal com ponents, a liquid metal loop would be needed. Key needs for DEMO include the need for integral off-normal behavior testing to validate the predictions of syst em behavior. Generation of dust in fusion systems is well known and ha s been characterized on se veral machines. During an accident there is a potential for a dust explosion. There are no tools for predicting dust explosions. If the potential for expl osion on DEMO is severe enough there may be a need to provide a gas inerting system on DEMO. Verification and validation of the tools and supporting data base are required for DEMO. In the long term, a new set of tools should be deve loped that take adva ntage of advances in computational science a nd our understandin g of the basic science underlying transient behavior. These advanced tool s (once validated a nd verified) can be used to reduce the margin associated with safety analysis, resulting in overall cost reduction. Gap: Waste Management Fusion has long recognized that by using lo w activation materials for the blanket and divertor, the activation characteristics of those structures will not require that they be disposed of as high level waste. The radiological hazard of fusion waste is much less than fission waste. Fusion needs to take advantage of these differences by developing a complete waste management strategy in light of the anticipated more restrictive regulatory environment when DEMO operates. While the amount of high level waste can be minimi zed, the result is a significant amount of low level waste. The strategy should in clude waste reducti on, recycling, and material clearance procedures. Fusion may have to develop techniques for detritiating waste prior to disposal or recycling. Development of guidelines for clearance of materials for release rather than disposal is ju st beginning and fusion needs to be involved in the process to assure the guideli nes recognize unique needs and materials in fusion components. Mission Elements: Overall validated simulation of fusion systems Simulation and bench-top experiments to understand single-effect phenomena for fusion components Development of low activation materials and PFCs with low tritium retention and low rates of dust formation Development and validation of fusion components Integrated tests on CTF. 4.b.15. Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Inspectability The Demo plant is expected to demonstrate the economic and productive capacity of a near-commercial sized plant using commercial-size and -type components. The Demo 186must show that it has the inherent component and system reliability to achieve high plant availability in order to be economic a nd competitive with other energy production technologies. Environmental friendliness may ease expectations on plant economy, but the Demo will still need a reasonably high av ailability to justify its expense and give confidence in fusion as a viable energy s ource. The Demo must overcome technology scale-up issues with in-vessel components wh ich exhibit a long opera ting lifetime. The ITER experiment can offer insights, and provi de lessons learned for operating a complex, integrated engineering Demo facility. If th e component and system designs in ITER are robust, they give confidence in operating at hi gher hours per year. Like previous fusion design studies, the Demo availability estima te will be obtained from a Boolean logic model of the plant systems. Accurate com ponent failure rate and repair time data are essential to produce accurate estimates of the plant availability and the analyses would suggest any areas that design al terations or redundant subsystems are needed to promote high plant availability. After the estimati on process, successful Demo operation would prove the accuracy of the estimate. Gap: Component failure rate data The ITER machine will provide some of the necessary feedback from operating experience to support design, fabrication, and operation of Demo components and systems. ITER operation will provide early life reliability data, and some useful lifetime data, for many types of compone nts, including in-vessel components. However, ITER operating time is brief a nd neutron fluence is low compared to what is expected for the Demo and futu re power plants. The data produced by ITER is fusion experience data that is cer tainly applicable to the next step, but some Demo in-vessel components will need an additional level of reliability assurance gained through accelerated life te sting. Also, ITER is a water-cooled machine providing data for a future Demo that would use a Rankine steam cycle for balance-of-plant power conversion to elec tricity. It is possible or even likely, that Demo will seek higher station efficien cy by using an exotic coolant (helium, liquid metal, molten salt) and a more advantageous thermodynamic operating cycle. In that case, the Demo would need failure rate data for the exotic systems that will not be provided by ITER. Data from an integrated component test facility would offer recent, highly releva nt operating experience data rather than relying on inference from past sodium-c ooled or present helium-cooled fission reactors. Gap: Maintenance data The ITER machine will provide a wealth of data for hands-on preventive and corrective maintenance of ex-vessel components and systems, and remote maintenance (refurbishment and replacement) of in-vessel components. Lessons learned from ITER are expected to carry forward to Demo. The gap would lie in one of two areas - either the ITER pl ant operating data is not collected and analyzed, or if the Demo design diverges away from the technologies used in ITER. If ITER records data in comput er files and retains these engineering operations data as JET has, then the info rmation can be retrieved, translated and examined at some future time. If th e Demo design diverges from ITER, then 187some sort of pilot plant would be needed to test scale models of Demo-type components, and the maintenance perfor med on the pilot plant would provide some necessary maintenance experiences to feed forward to the Demo. Gap: Inspection techniques Inspection rules for fission reactors do not apply very well to fusion. The ITER experiment will forge new paths forward for proving device integrity to reliably contain modest amounts of tritium fuel and activation products. The Demo facility would likely have higher radiologica l and chemical inventories on site and in-vessel than ITER, so system inte grity carries both economic and safety concerns. Tests and inspections base d on equipment condition monitoring can focus on the most likely failure mechanisms, and these will be learned during ITER operation. As pointed out previous ly, if the Demo design diverges from ITER, then new techniques or methods ma y need to be developed for the Demo. If a pilot plant or test faci lity is built for exotic co mponents, that facility will provide opportunity for evaluating inspection techniques to use on Demo even while it is testing the Demo components. Mission Elements: Continue reliability data collection and analysis, stair-stepping from present machines to ITER, and ITER to Demo, and incorporating results of accelerated life tests for selected components if necessary Continue maintenance data collection, both human and robotic, from present machines such as JET to apply to ITER, then stair-step from ITER to Demo Test any exotic components in a component test facility, co llect the facility operations data and inspection methods data for use on Demo exotic systems 4.c. Discussion of overarching issues As the lists of issues and gaps were developed, a set of overa rching technical issues arose which did not fit neatly into any of the broad research areas that we had identified. The issues were: high availability, maintainab ility, reliability and ec onomics. (Safety might also fit logically onto this list, but we felt th at there were enough sp ecific technical issues related to plant and public safety to call it out by itself.) These overarching issues describe general properties that would be required for a pr actical fusion reactor like Demo, but were not the special domain of any particular topical area or technical realm. They are characteristics which drive, implic itly or explicitly, much of the technical discussions in fusion science and would have to be designed into every part of a fusion reactor system. Each is an additional qualifier on the other technical requirements for fusion energy. At the same time, none are a do minant constraint on th e current generation of experiments and are only weak drivers for th e ITER design. However, as we consider the step to Demo, these issues become major requirements. We should not underestimate the impact th at these overarching issues have on our research programs. Though it will be decades before solutions are required, in many 188cases, these issues provide the context for all the others and focus our attention on a narrower set of approaches. Perhaps the most salient example is the focus on schemes and concepts which would allow continuous op eration of fusion reactors. We clearly have in hand, the ability to run very long pu lses without auxiliary drive. However, the engineering benefits, as measur ed against criteria such as availability, reliability and economics, clearly favor steady state. In a nother example, the interest in high-Z first walls is driven, in part, by concerns over er osion of other materials and the desire to increase the interval for first-wall main tenance. The hundred-fold increase in availability entailed in going from ITER to Demo requires that we develop a much better ability to predict erosion and redeposition rates from all parts of the first wall. These overarching issues were not called out as separate qu estions because they are so intricately woven into the others. While dealing with them separately might appropriately raise their visibi lity, it might also cause us to overlook their importance as we define research require ments in other areas. 4.d. High-level organization of gaps The large set of fine granularity gaps discu ssed above were consolidated into a smaller set which emphasizes those with the greatest importance and the le ast likelihood of being resolved by current research. While this set of \"Major\" gaps, corresponds topically to most of broad questions outline d in chapter 2, the two lists should not be confused. The list of gaps has gone through the sieve of chap ter 3 and what remains are the high-level gaps in our knowledge that will remain even after current programs complete their research. As mentioned before, this filtering is not an exact process. In many cases we weighed the uncertainty over whether a partic ular issue might be resolved against the consequence that it wouldn't be. That is , for now it is prudent to be somewhat pessimistic about the chance of solving some of the re ally critical questions. What follows is a list of the consolidated major gaps with a brief description of the important elements of each. Summary of Major Gaps G-1. Sufficient understanding of all areas of the underlying plasma physics to predict the performance and optimize the design a nd operation of future devices. While the subject of much current and past research, it is likely that important areas such as turbulent transport and multi-scale, multi-physics coupling will require significant additional effort. Recent improvements in physical understanding, computationa l horsepower and numerical algorithms have been dramatic, but the complexity of the problem and the range of temporal and spatial scales suggest that there is no prospect of a first-principl es solution by brute force. Coupling models across tradit ionally separate topical phy sics areas is an area of long-term research that will likely require decades of further work. It is worth noting that the diagnostic set for ITER and several of the other new initiatives are 189not sufficiently ambitious, in our view, to fully resolve these questions. Specific concerns in transport science include the ability to apply turbulence simulations on transport time scales; to predict the stru cture and stability of transport barriers, to understand electron, particle and mome ntum transport channels and to predict the dependences of transport on magnetic configuration including shape, aspect ratio and degree of internal/external magneti zation. Also important is the precise prediction of stability boundaries in support of disruption avoidance. G-2. Demonstration of integrated, steady- state, high-performance (advanced) burning plasmas, including first wall a nd divertor interactions. The main challenge is combining high fusi on gain with the strategies needed for steady-state operation. While the pr ogram has had remarkable success in achieving individual performance benc hmarks, combining these requires reconciling somewhat contradictory requi rements. For example, producing high- Q burning plasmas demands high absolute parameters, particularly pressure, while steady state is most easily achieved with high normalized parameters like . Further, because of the demands for effici ent current drive, steady-state tokamaks tend to be driven toward low density, below the optimum for producing fusion power and far below the most desirable conditions for compatibility with first wall and divertor designs. G-3. Diagnostic techniques suitable for cont rol of steady-state advanced burning plasmas which are compatible with the nuclear environment of a reactor. The principle gap here is in developi ng robust measurement techniques which can be used in the hostile environment of a fusion reactor. The vessel and its surroundings will be subj ect to intense neutron and gamma bombardment excluding many of the techniques in use today. This limits what sorts of materials, optics and sensors are allowable. Furthe r difficulties are imposed by the high temperature of the first wall, which will be held at temperatures in excess of 700C. The requirement for continuous operation at high availability wi ll also challenge traditional approaches for calibration and te sting of diagnostic systems. There is also a need to develop innovative measurement techniques for non-nuclear devices which can be used to validate predictive simulations. G-4. Control strategies for high-perform ance burning plasmas, running near operating limits, with auxiliary systems providing only a small fraction of the heating power and current drive. In a high-Q burning plasma, almost all of the power and the current drive is generated by the plasma itself. Unlike current devices, external control will be at most perturbative. Innovative strategies must be developed to allow the creation of the sort of optimized profiles that lead to satisfact ory performance. Possibilities include manipul ation of the hydrogen isotop e mix via deep fueling to control fusion power deposition; direct control of the pressure profile by manipulation of plasma transport, for example through RF flow drive; fine adjustment of the current profile with a minimal amount of external drive or control of the poloidal field by the addition of external helical windings. Overall 190control must be precise to avoid disrup tions and other off-normal events and to minimize thermal excursions on first wall components. G-5. Ability to predict and avoid or detect and mitigate off-normal events that could challenge the integrity of fusion devices. For a tokamak to be viable as a fusion reactor, disruptions and other off-normal events must be reduced dramatically. Current understanding of the causes and dynamics of disruption is insufficient. It is also not possible to distinguish, by current measurements, the small differences that cause one discharge to disrupt while another similar discharge does not . For Demo, the requirement for virtually no full performance disruptions will require significant improvements in MHD models and in plasma measurement and analysis. Similarly, other off- normal events caused by large scale plasma instabilities, for example ELMs or fast-particle modes, must be understood and controlled. G-6. Sufficient understanding of alternative magnetic configurations which have the ability to operate in steady-state without off-normal plasma events. If high-performance tokamaks can not be made to operate efficiently in steady- state and without disruptions, alternative con cepts will need to be advanced to fill the gap. These must demonstrate, through theory and experiment, that they can meet the performance requirements with su fficient reliability to extrapolate to a reactor. Along the way, they must dem onstrate that they are free from off-normal events or other phenomena which would lowe r their availability or suitability for fusion power applications. G-7. Integrated understanding of RF launc hing structures and wave coupling for scenarios suitable for Demo and compatible with the nuclear and plasma environment The auxiliary systems typically used in current experiments, while extremely useful tools, are not generally suitable for a reactor. RF schemes are the most likely systems to be used and will requ ire significant research to achieve the levels of reliability and predictability that are required. The stresses on launching structures for ICRH or LHCD in a high radiation, high heat-flux environment will require designs which are less than optim al from the point of view of wave physics and which may require developmen t of new materials and new cooling strategies. Validated models of coupled networks, antennas and wave physics will be needed along with stra tegies for coupling high pow er across the large gaps between the plasma and launching structures. Even with large plasma gaps the ICH or LHCD antennas will be basically flush with the First Wall and be subjected to the heat and electromech anical loading as other First Wall elements. However, they will also have to be compatible with the RF field environment, which puts additional li mitations on material selection and mechanical support methodologies. G-8. The knowledge base required to m odel and build low and high-temperature superconducting magnet systems that provide r obust, cost-effective magnets (at higher fields if required). 191Additional research will be required to improve predictive understanding of conductors, structures and insulators suitable for fusion magnets, allowing increased magnet performance and reduced costs and design margins. Critical issues include crack growth and damage in composite materials. This is particularly true for high-temperature superconductors which offer the possibility of operating at higher field but are a relatively new technology. Innovative fabrication techniques will be required to allow these materials to be used in fusion magnets. Quench detection a nd protection for high temperature superconductors is a significant problem as the propagation slows by about three orders of magnitude compar ed to low-temperature supe rconductors, challenging diagnostic systems. G-9. Sufficient understanding of plasma-wall in teractions to predict the environment for and behavior of plasma facing and other internal components for Demo conditions. A predictive understanding of the plasma sc rape-off layer (SOL) must be attained via improvements in modeling and experime nts. These need to be focused on turbulence and cross-field transport which while poorly understood, is an important factor in determining SOL prope rties. As we move into the reactor regime, the mean free path for radiation and neutrals falls below characteristic machine scale lengths in many parts of th e SOL plasma. The impact of this new physics needs to be verified and modeled. The science underlying the interaction of plasma and material needs to be significantly strengthened to allow prediction of erosion and redeposition ra tes, tritium retention, dust production and damage to the first wall. Strategies to mitigate impurity generation associated with RF sheaths need to be developed. G-10. Understanding of the use of low activ ation solid and liquid materials, joining technologies and cooling strate gies sufficient to design ro bust first-wall and divertor components in a high heat flux, st eady-state nuclear environment. Research into the basic properties of low-activation materials under high heat loads and simultaneous neutron bombardmen t must be carried out to develop and qualify materials for reactor plasma facing components. Of particular importance is any modification of their heat conduc tion, tritium permeation and retention and the maintenance of their structural properties. The understanding and characterization of welds, brazes and other joining techniques, in the same hostile environment must also be significantly increased. Heat transfer across the joints and embrittlement from neutron damage and hydrogen permeation are particular concerns. Strategies for efficient heat removal at high temperatures with gas coolant must be developed. While liquid-surface first walls offer some relief from the challenges facing solid surface walls, the information required to employ them with confidence is almost entirely absent. There are major questions about the compatibility of the liquids with structures, MHD effects on moving conductors and contamination of the pl asma by evaporation or sputtering. Innovative techniques to ensure sufficient mass flow to remove heat are required as temperatures must generally be kept lo w compared to solid first wall materials. Strategies for helium pump ing must be developed. 192 G-11. Understanding the elements of the comple te fuel cycle particularly tritium breeding and retention in vessel components. Strategies for high-efficiency tritium breeding must be developed and tested. This includes the choice of breeding material and the basic thermal-hydraulic design. Breeding modules, capable of ma intaining structural integrity at high temperatures in the presence of large neutron fluences must be developed. The throughput of tritium recovery and sepa ration systems must be increased substantially to keep up with the fusion rates in continuously operating, reactor- scale devices. Methods for strict accoun ting of all tritium in the plant including permeation in components and piping must be developed along with approaches for eliminating long-term tritium retention in vessel components. G-12. An engineering science base for the eff ective removal of heat at high temperatures from first wall and breeding components in the fusion environment. Strategies for removing heat, at elevated temperatures with limited maintenance, from the blankets and first wall must be developed. Efficient and reliable methods for conversion of the heat in the high temperature coolant, including allowances for the unique role associated with tr itium management issues, need to be developed and demonstrated on dedicated test stands. G-13. Understanding of the e volving properties of low acti vation materials in the fusion environment necessary for structur al and first wall components. We must obtain a basic unders tanding of the behavior of relevant low-activation materials exposed to simultaneous fusion neutron irradiation, high heat fluxes, and substantial mechanical stresses over length scales ranging from atomic to macroscopic and time periods ranging from 10 -15 s to years. This will include the effects of materials chemistry and tritium permeation at high-temperatures. Important properties like dimensional stability, phase stability, thermal conductivity, fracture toughness, yield st rength and ductility must be characterized as a function of neutron bo mbardment up to very high levels of atomic displacement in a fusion-relevant environment. G-14. The knowledge base for fusion systems suff icient to guarantee safety over the plant life cycle - including licensing and commissi oning, normal operation, off-normal events and decommissioning/disposal. Comprehensive models for fusion systems must be developed to support safety analysis and licensing. Especially importa nt are accurate descriptions of system dynamics under off-normal events or accid ents. Large scale fusion components must be qualified and experience gain ed with their remote handling. The generation and nature of dust produced in a fusion reactor must be characterized along with a predictive assessm ent of tritium content and release associated with that dust. Strategies to control and acc ount for total tritium inventory must be developed along with plans for long term wa ste management and disposal. 193G-15. The knowledge base for efficient main tainability of in-v essel components to guarantee the availability goals of Demo are achievable. In order to achieve the desired availability of >50% for Demo, in-vessel components have to incorporate designs th at, besides meeting all the performance requirements within a high neutron fluence environment, have lend themselves to quick change out when damaged. It would not be unreasonable to expect that this will require the development of special remote tooling for in-vessel component removal and re-installation, with the adde d need to perform inspection and quality control remotely. The invessel robotics must be capable of withstanding high radiation for extended peri ods of time. The material selected for joints or attachment points will have to be carefully chosen, with the expectation that multiple cutting and rewelding operations may take place. 194 195 Chapter 5 New Facili ties, Initiatives and Programs In the previous chapter, we'v e outlined gaps in knowledge th at will likely remain after current and planned research activities are complete. These gaps are provided at coarse and fine levels of granularity. Research activ ities, which could be undertaken to fill each of the fine-scale gaps, have also been descri bed. Next, we identify a set of higher level initiatives and major facilities which cons olidate these mission elements in a more integrated and coherent manner. 5.a. Synthesis The list of proposed major initiatives came from consideration of knowledge gaps and U.S. opportunities. Each initiative represents an opportunity, with appropriate investment, for U.S. leadership in the world program. Most could be carried out with substantial international collaboration or could be led by an international partner with substantial U.S. involvement. Each makes a dominant contributi on to at least one of the identified gaps and typically secondary contributions to severa l others. A sense of the priority of each initiative can be gained by considering the pr iorities of the issues and gaps that are addressed. The initiatives and facilities listed, attack important research questions by breaking the problems into tractable pieces. Because of the strong coupling between issues, each is only an imperfect substitute for carrying out experiments on Demo itself - which can't be built until the research is complete, cr eating a logical impasse . The long-standing solution to the impasse, and the one we adopt here, is to augment research on major facilities, which approximate Demo in important ways, with basic research and a strategic and systematic program of modeling and va lidation. This approach provides the necessary scientific underpinnings and a stro ng basis for extrapolation. In general, a phased approach is required, beginning with theory, modeling and laboratory experiments, moving on to test stands or modest scale facilities and culminating in large-scale integrated experiments. More details on these multi-phase strategies are provided in section 5.c. In some cases more than one initiative is liste d to address a particular gap. For example, a major effort to enhance the advanced toka mak program on ITER has a similar goal as a new major facility aimed at investigating th e same science. One of these would be necessary, in our judgment, to provide the information required to go forward with a Demo based on AT physics. The choice betw een the alternatives would be based on technical, political and economic factors. It may be possible to combine the missions 196two or more of the facilities listed below into a single larg er initiative, though only after careful consideration of cost s and benefits. For example, the main requirement for a component qualification facility is to provi de continuous, steady and predictable nuclear operation which may be at odds with a plasma physics research mission. 5.b. Table of possible major init iatives, facilities and programs I-1. Initiative toward predictive plasma modeling and validation This activity describes a coordinate d program which would combine major advances in theory based plasma simulations, especially multi-scale, multi-physics issues combined with a vigorous e ffort to validate these models against large and small-scale experiments. A critical element would be the development and deployment of new measurement techniques. I-2. Extensions to ITER AT capabilities This initiative would entail new or enhanced drivers (heating, current drive, etc.), control tools and diagnostic s capable of carrying out a comprehensive AT physics program. The aim would be to achieve an understanding of burning AT regimes sufficient to base Demo on. I-3. Integrated advanced bur ning physics demonstration This facility would be a dedicated sust ained, high-performance burning plasma experiment with a goal to achieve an unde rstanding sufficient to base Demo on. It is predicated on the condition that exte nsions to the ITER AT program and predictive understanding fr om the international superconducting tokamaks will not achieve an understanding suffici ent for extrapolation to Demo. I-4. Integrated experiment for plasma wall interactions and plas ma facing components This very-long pulse or steady-state c onfinement experiment would perform research on plasma wall interactions and plasma facing components in a non-DT integrated facility. It wo uld attempt to duplicate and st udy, as closely as possible, all of the issues and (non-nuclear) pr oblems that PWI/PFCs would face in a reactor. I-5. Advanced experiment in disruption-free concepts This would be a performance extens ion device for a concept that had demonstrated promise for fusion applica tions by projecting to high performance and efficient steady state, and which wa s significantly less susceptible to off- normal events compared to a tokamak. A stellarator would be the mostly likely candidate for such a facility. I-6. Engineering and materials physics modeli ng and experimental validation initiative This would be a coordinated and compre hensive research program consisting of advanced computer modeling and laborat ory testing aimed at establishing the single-effects science for major fusion t echnology issues, including materials, plasma-wall interactions, plasma-facing components, joining technologies, super- 197conducting magnets, tritium breeding, RF and fueling systems. While existing facilities could be used for this initia tive, construction of new ones would be required as well. (This effort would enab le items I4, I8, I9, and possibly I3.) I-7. Materials qualification facility This initiative would involve testing and qualification of low-activation materials by intense neutron bombardment. The facility generally associated with this mission is the International Fusion Materi als Irradiation Facility (IFMIF). The potential for alternative neutron irradi ation facilities to reduce or possibly eliminate the need for the US to participat e as a full partner in IFMIF needs to be assessed. I-8. Component development and testing program This would entail coordinated research a nd development for multi-effect issues in critical technology areas. Examples are breeding/blanket modul es and first wall components but this initia tive could include other im portant components like magnet systems or RF launchers. This program would most likely be carried out as enabling research in direct preparat ion and support of planned nuclear fusion facilities such as ITER, CTF or Demo. I-9. Component qualification facility This facility is aimed at testing and valid ating plasma and nuclear technologies in a high availability, high heat flux, high neutron fluence DT device. It would qualify components for Demo and establis h the basis for licensing. In fusion energy development plans, this machine is called a Component Test Facility (CTF). 5.c. Relation of initiatives to gaps The potential for each initiative to fill identif ied gaps is summarized in figure 5.1. The chart is meant to illustrate graphically, the level of contri bution that each initiative or facility makes toward each of the gap areas. A complete program leading toward Demo could be developed by choosing a set of the initiatives listed sufficient to fill every gap. The U.S. program would need to decide which initiatives to lead and which to collaborate or participate in. In the following section, the strategy and logic fo r filling each gap is described. This includes a discussion of alternate paths, important dependencies and sequencing. G-1. Sufficient understanding of all areas of the underlying plasma physics to predict the performance and optimize the de sign and operation of future devices. This gap is addressed by a combination of theory/model development and experimental validation. The principal tool is initiative 1 (I1) an extensive program of validation on a wide range of experimental facilities and extension of fundamental theory and modeling to a ddress the relevant multi-scale, multi- physics issues. Development of and de ployment advanced diagnostics are 198considered part of I1. This gap also benefits from increases in knowledge of plasma physics (I2-I5), particularly thos e in the burning plasma range (I2, I3). G-2. Demonstration of integrated, st eady-state, high-performance (advanced) burning plasmas, including first wall and divertor interactions. This gap could be addressed by either enhancements of ITER capabilities (I2) supporting an extensive AT program, or if th at is not feasible, by construction of a new burning plasma device (I3 ). It also benefits fr om development of improved plasma models (I1) which would be carried out in advance and concurrently with the experiments. G-3. Diagnostic techniques suitable for c ontrol of steady-state advanced burning plasmas which are compatible with the nuclear environment of a reactor . This gap could be filled by development and testing of diagnostics on any of the proposed burning plasma experiments (I2, I3, I9). The requirement for success is that the diagnostics survive in the fusion environment and are capable of providing the measurements needed for control in the advanced regimes needed for Demo. G-4. Control strategies for high-perf ormance burning plasmas, running near operating limits, with auxiliary systems providing only a small fraction of the heating power and current drive. This gap could be filled by research into control strategies on high-Q burning plasma experiments (I2, I3). It is supported by development of predictive plasma models (I1). G-5. Ability to predict and avoid or detect and mitigate off-normal events that could challenge the integrity of fusion devices. Filling this gap requires a sequence of st eps. First would come development and validation of models which can reliab ly describe the multi-physics effects associated with disruptions, ELMs and ot her off-normal plasma events (I1). These models would be combined with strategies developed on current and planned experiments and extended and te sted on long-pulse, low duty-cycle high- Q plasmas (I2, I3). These strategies could then be applied to continuous, high duty-cycle burning plasmas (I9). G-6. Sufficient understanding of alternative concepts which have the ability to operate in steady-state w ithout off-normal plasma events. This gap represents a possible alternat ive to solving the disruption and ELM problems on a tokamak. It would be filled by experiments which succeed in demonstrating operation free of off-norma l plasma events simultaneous with performance that could be extrapolated to a Demo (I5). Development of validated plasma models would help provide the necessary underpinnings for this line of research (I1). 199 How Initiatives Could Address Gaps Legend Major Contribution 3 Significant Contribution 2 Minor Contribution 1 No Important Contribution G-1 Plasma Predictive capability G-2 Integrated plasma demonstration G-3 Nuclear-capable Diagnostics G-4 Control near limits with minimal power G-5 Avoidance of Large-scale Off- normal events in tokamaks G-6 Developments for concepts free of off-normal plasma events G-7 Reactor capable RF launching structures G-8 High-Performance Magnets G-9 Plasma Wall Interactions G-10 Plasma Facing Components G-11 Fuel cycle G-12 Heat removal G-13 Low activation materials G-14 Safety G-15 Maintainability I-1.

To what extent does each proposed initia tives (rows) address the important gaps (columns) G-7. Integrated understanding of RF launc hing structures and wave coupling for scenarios suitable for Demo and compatible with the nuclear and plasma environment. This gap could be filled by research on any of the proposed burning plasma experiments (I2, I3, I9). New experiments may be somewhat more valuable as they could allow more flexibility than those constrained by the frozen design on ITER. This gap would also benefit from a facility de signed for development and testing of large components in a nuclear environment (I8). G-8. The knowledge base required to model low and high-temperature superconducting magnet systems in order to provide robust, cost-effective magnets (at higher fields if required). This gap would be filled by first init iating a program of basic research and computational model development and labor atory testing (I6). The next step would be design of high-performance ma gnet systems for new fusion experiments (I3, I9) and Demo itself. G-9. Sufficient understanding of plasma -wall interactions to predict the environment for and behavior of plasma facing and other internal components for Demo conditions. This gap would be filled by a multi-step, multi-faceted program. The first step would be development of edge plasma m odels (I1) and plasma-wall models (I6) including comparison with laboratory test stands and confinement experiments. As the only DT device currently planned, ITER would play an important role in this research. A non-burning experiment might provide a bridge to nuclear facilities by developing understanding and by providing a flexible test-bed for new ideas (I4). These models could be refined by research on advanced burning plasma experiments (I2, I3) and a conti nuous, high-fluence nuclear testing device (I9) G-10. Understanding of the properties of lo w activation solid and liquid materials, joining technologies and cool ing strategies sufficient to design robust first-wall and divertor components in a high heat flux, steady-state nuclear environment. This gap is filled in a similar manner to G9 with the addition of a staged program of materials research and component de velopment (I6), materials testing and qualification in a fusion-relevant envi ronment (I7) and component testing (I8) with proof tests on an advanced burni ng plasma experiment (I3) and a fusion reactor component te st facility (I9). G-11. Understanding the elements of the co mplete fuel cycle particularly tritium breeding and retention in vessel components. This gap also requires a staged approach . The first step would be a research program, involving both laboratory experi ments and computer simulation, into DRAFT Report of FESAC sub-panel - Do not circulate 201neutron transport and breeding, thermal hydr aulics of breeding and cooling fluids and a host of other issues (I6). This program might include participation in the TBM program on ITER. Knowledge gained in this research would be applied next to component development and te sting (I8) and qualification (I9). G-12. An engineering scie nce base for the effective removal of heat at high temperatures from first wall and breeding components in the fusion environment. The strategy to fill this gap would be sim ilar to that for G11 except that a different set of engineering problems would need to be addressed, in particular establishment of viable t echniques to reliably and e fficiently convert the heat from high temperature coolants to electri city with limited maintenance needs. The tritium extraction and processing methodology needs to be fully compatible with the energy extraction and conversion processes. G-13. Understanding of evolving properties of low activation materials in the fusion environment relevant for st ructural and first wall components. This gap would be filled by a multi-step program. The first step would be identification of promising materials through the development of multi-scale models for fusion relevant materials and basic materials science research (I6). Selected materials would be tested with fission neutron sources or spallation sources (I6). The next step would be to develop and qualify a very small number of the most promising materials in a materi als qualification facility such as IFMIF (I7). These materials would then be built into components and tested (I8) and then qualified in a continuous burning plasma facility (I9). G-14. The knowledge base for fusion syst ems sufficient to guarantee safety over the plant life cycle - including licensing and commissi oning, normal operation, off-normal events and decommissioning/disposal. Gaps in safety and environmental know ledge would be fille d by a long term program of modeling and basic research (I6) and would follow closely the development of fusion components and syst em (I7). The component qualification facility (I9) would represent a synthesis of previous research and a demonstration of safe and environmentally benign fusion energy. G-15. The knowledge base for efficient main tainability of in-vessel components to guarantee the availability goals of Demo are achievable. Gaps in maintainability would be fill ed by a broad program on ITER and any future DT or long-pulse DD devices. The component qualification facility (I9) would represent the best opportunity to demonstrate design, materials choices, fabrication techniques and strategies for a ssembly that were all consistent with maintainability and remote handling, if it uses similar approaches as those selected for Demo. DRAFT Report of FESAC sub-panel - Do not circulate 202 5.d. Resource Requirements And Risk Management No attempt was made to cost out the initiati ves listed above in section 5.b, however it is clear that all will require major investments. The component qualification facility and the advanced burning plasma experiment would likely rival all fusion facilities, excepting ITER, in cost. The panel is not unaware of the challenge in arranging funding for such large endeavors. It was not within our charge to develop a detailed strategy for fusion energy development, however we think it is worth noting some of the considerations which would go into a plan based on the work presented here. A co mprehensive plan would be organized to fill all of the gaps discussed in chapter 4 ta king cognizance of the risks inherent in developing any new science and technology. Th e main risk faced is delay in deployment of fusion energy due to unforeseen technical di fficulties in carrying out the plan, to costs which make the first generation of fusion reactors economically uncompetitive or to insurmountable problems along the development path chosen. At some point delay is equivalent to failure, as government and indu stry conclude that no solution will be forthcoming. That is, a program carried out so slowly and deliberately as to never make a wrong step may carry more risk than one whic h tries to move more boldly and accepts that it will make some mistakes and follow some blind paths. The principle strategy to mitigate risk is to implement a sufficiently broad program so that alternative approaches or technologies are available at each step. Any research program, no matter how carefully planned may not provide the information or knowledge at the time it is needed to take the next logical step in development. One goal of a strategic plan for fusion would be to maximize the chance that the required information is available by providing deep scientific foundations for the necessary disciplines and by following alternate research paths where uncertainties are greatest. It is clear that there is a direct trade-off between risks and costs and that budgets will always require making choices about which lines of research to follow. One important set of choices for the U.S. program involve s deciding which issues to address through international collaboration and which to take on itself. Clearly the U.S. will be working with and relying on foreign programs for th e foreseeable future, however, maintaining some level of core competency in all releva nt technical areas is probably a prerequisite for effective partnership and a necessity if the U.S. aspires to leadership in fusion energy development in the future.
