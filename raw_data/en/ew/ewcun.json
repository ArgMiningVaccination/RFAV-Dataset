About the partners6 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 Foreword We are honoured to partner with the Central Board of Secondary Education to bring you this publication. We want to acknowledge here the amazing work done by CBSE teachers who joined the global teaching community in shifting from face-to-face classrooms to virtual classrooms almost instantaneously in response to the Covid-19 pandemic closures. I would also like to thank the Alpha Plus team of UK experts who worked collaboratively with CBSE to create this publication, and the British Council project team for their overall management of the project. This publication is a part of the CBSE competency-based education project and supports the assessment of NCERT- recommended learning outcomes. High quality assessment, curriculum and pedagogy are the golden triangle of any education system and when these are made available to young people in an enabling environment, they have a profound impact on learning outcomes. This project focuses on two of the three critical areas, assessment and pedagogy, and is aligned to the NCERT curriculum. India has already set out to achieve its knowledge ambitions through the new National Education Policy 2020. This sets out the road map India has chosen for itself on this journey as it shifts its focus from access to high quality education and innovation promoting conceptual and deep learning. Education is one of the key pillars of cultural relations and an important aspect of the British Council's work in India and across the world. We hope that this project will truly transform young people's experience of assessment and learning in CBSE schools across the country and we look forward to the opportunity to work with the Ministry of Education in the future. All the best and happy teaching! Barbara Wickham OBE Director India, British Council 7 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 Foreword Central Board of Secondary Education with more than 25,000 schools in its network, in both rural and urban settings, has been committed to excellence in education. Since inception, the Board has been taking initiatives to meet the continually evolving requirements of the changing school education system. The shift to the digital world and the recent pandemic has dramatically altered ways of teaching and learning. In the digitalised global world, the use and application of knowledge by learners has become of crucial importance. Competency Based Education (CBE) is an alternative to ensure a future ready generation proficient in relevant skills. CBSE with its focus on holistic education is facilitating this progression to CBE where learners would gain mastery of 21st century skills. It becomes critical to reinvent the ways of teaching and learning in the classrooms. CBSE in partnership with British Council has initiated a systematic process to progressively move towards a competency-based education and assessment process. Under this project, an intervention for science, math and English (reading) from Classes 6 to 10 is planned which aims to strengthen system capacity; orient teachers to adopt relevant pedagogy, design and deliver competency-based assessments; and create a conducive environment that facilitates high quality competency-based education. CBSE is working towards a seamless transition to CBE for which policy-makers, school regulators and teachers are on-board as champions of change. It is intended that the resources and tools to implement their learning on the ground developed as a part of this programme will be made available as widely as possible through digital and physical means. I would like to thank British Council for coming forward to partner with CBSE in this ever-important agenda. Manoj Ahuja Chairman, CBSE8 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 CBSE assessment specifications This document sets out the approach we have taken to the design of the assessment specifications for the CBSE end-of-class tests and how the documents produced can be used by CBSE and teachers to create tests which meet the demands of the relevant aspects of the NCERT curriculum and CBSE syllabuses. 1.1. Remit Alpha Plus were commissioned by the British Council to design and create assessment specifications based on the NCERT curriculum for English reading, maths and science for CBSE. The specifications were required to cover Classes 6 to 10 end-of-class written tests and were to use the CBSE syllabus documents as a basis for the content to be assessed against the NCERT curriculum. This work is the second of a series of five projects commissioned by the British Council in India to help support a transition to a competency-based education and assessment system. The first project was a review of the current assessment approach carried out by UK NARIC. The third and fourth projects will involve upskilling assessment designers and item writers and producing a bank of questions which can be used by CBSE and/or teachers to create the end-of-class tests. The final project is to support teachers in moving to a pedagogy which supports the aims of the NCERT curriculum. 1.2. Approach The NCERT curriculum is based on a series of learning outcomes and pedagogical approaches with some examples of content/context suggested. The focus of the curriculum is on the students developing a broad range of skills within the relevant subject areas which support their progression in school and more widely as global citizens. These learning outcomes set out at a relatively high level the skills that students are expected to be able to demonstrate and are written in a way that facilitate the teaching of the content of any of the different Indian exam boards. In other words, the NCERT curriculum is not a definitive national curriculum which sets out what should be taught in each of the classes for each subject. The intention of the NCERT curriculum is that students should develop higher order thinking skills that better prepare them for later life, rather than a focus on learning of facts. Whilst the NCERT curriculum is well known to teachers, it is not universally well understood and there is a significant amount of teaching practice which still focuses on students learning facts and teaching to the text book rather than developing these broader skills. In commissioning Alpha Plus to produce assessment specifications for a suite of end subjects for CBSE, the British Council expects that the tests which will be produced (using items created in a later project) will encourage teachers to focus on higher order thinking skills and move away from rote learning. The expectation is that there will be a positive washback effect from the assessments on the pedagogy employed by teachers. This change will also be supported by the final project which will produce learning resources and train teachers on the best way to deliver the NCERT curriculum intentions. 1.2.1. Defining the assessment content The first step in the process was to review the NCERT curriculum and identify how the relevant CBSE syllabus which sets out the content to be taught could be married to the curriculum. This mapping produced a 'Learning Ladder' which identified both pedagogy and learning outcomes from the NCERT curriculum which are then aligned with the content from the CBSE syllabus. This learning ladder is presented so that the assessment content is linked directly to the NCERT curriculum which will facilitate amendments to be made if the curriculum changes in future. As part of the initial review of the NCERT curriculum, the learning outcomes and pedagogical approaches related solely to writing, listening and speaking skills were removed from the English reading learning ladder as the assessment focuses solely on reading skills.9 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 1.2.2. Creating design principles As the first stage in a series of projects (of which the design of the assessment specifications is the second), the British Council had contracted UK NARIC to review the approach taken by CBSE to the design of their standard X exams. This review produced a report detailing the strengths and weaknesses of the approach when compared to other international examples. It identified a number of recommendations which CBSE could adopt in order to strengthen its assessment approach. This report and the recommendations were then used to identify the high level approach to the design of the assessments. These became the high level design principles against which the assessment specifications were created. 1.2.3. Producing the assessment specifications The assessment specifications were designed to sample the assessment content set out in the learning ladders and use the design principles. The size of the assessment and the length of time allowed are a balance between sampling enough content to allow the assessments to be valid and show what students know and can do and not being so long that the administration of the assessments is a burden for both the student and the school to deliver. The assessments are generally shorter for lower classes as there is less content to sample and shorter tests are more reasonable for younger students. Assessment objectives specific for each subject were created using the learning outcomes in the NCERT curriculum as a starting point to identify the high level skills which needed to be assessed. These assessment objectives are similar to those used in other international qualifications for 11 to 16 year old students and are applied to all classes, though the proportion varies for each class. Generally, there are a greater proportion of higher order thinking skills assessed in Classes 9 and 10 than in the lower classes. Each subject takes a slightly different approach because of the nature of the subject and the skills and content that they need to cover. For English, the focus on assessing reading means the assessments are relatively shorter in Classes 6 to 8 than the other subjects as teachers would also be expected to assess student's listening, speaking and writing skills. This changes at Class 9 with the introduction of literature skills into the assessment and with more extended response questions which significantly increases the length of the assessment. For maths the need to assess students' abilities to use a calculator and in mental maths means that two separate assessments are required. The mental maths skills are more important in lower classes so are more heavily weighted in these classes and hence the non-calculator tests are longer. For Classes 9 and 10, the non-calculator assessments are proportionally shorter but for all classes there is a total time of 2 hours split across two assessments. In science, the emphasis is on assessing the ability of students to apply their knowledge, analyse data and evaluate information and this increases in classes 9 and 10. Aspects of practical skills can be assessed in written tests but the students ability to manipulate equipment and carry out practical procedures cannot be assessed in a written test so these skills should be assessed by the teacher through lab books, projects and practical assessments. 1.2.4. Creating example items In order to illustrate the approach to be taken when creating the actual assessments some exemplar items were created. These illustrate the types of questions which can be used and the way in which questions can be linked together, particularly in English with common sources used and in science with questions linked to a common theme. The items also demonstrate the approach to marking using both point based mark schemes and level of response mark schemes for extended response questions. The level of response mark schemes used in English reading and science are generic and will be used throughout the assessment items produced for that subject with changes to the indicative content for each question. 1.3. Documents The following documents exist: Learning ladder - sets out the content for each class for each subject Assessment objectives - set out the skills to be assessed and the proportion of marks for each Assessment specification - sets out the guidance for test duration, number of marks, content coverage, question types, mark scheme approach and rubric requirements. Example items - illustrate the types of items which can be used and how they can be grouped.10 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 1.4. Using the documents to create tests The assessment specification and the learning ladder should be used to identify the specific topic areas which will be covered in an assessment and the item writers should then be commissioned to produce items which meet the required content and assessment objectives. This step is the creation of the detailed blue print for a specific test. This is beyond the design of the assessment specification and hence the scope of this project. If a bank of items are created then items can be tagged with metadata showing content and assessment objectives coverage and this can be used to select items from the bank to meet the requirements, though it is likely that a small number of items may need to be commissioned to complete the tests to ensure a balanced content and assessment objectives coverage is achieved. The example items would serve as a guide to item writers on the style and type of questions which can be used to cover specific assessment objectives. 1.5. Acknowledgements Alpha Plus would like to acknowledge the support of CBSE in producing these assessment framework documents and specifically the following subject experts who reviewed the learning ladders, provided invaluable feedback and answered queries about the content. Ms Meera Bhardwaj, Ms Ruchi Sengar and Dr Praggya and Dr Sweta Singh for science.11 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 High level design principles for CBSE end-of-year VI-X assessments This document sets out the high level design principles for the CBSE end-of-year tests for Classes 6 to 10. These assessments are end-of-year tests and are designed to assess the content of the NCERT curriculum for that class and for Classes 9 and 10, the relevant content of the CBSE syllabus. 1.1. Aim and underpinning principles The design of the assessments will take into account the review of the CBSE Class 10 syllabus and assessments carried out by UK NARIC where they have made a number of recommendations which would also be relevant to end-of-year summative tests for Classes 6 to 10. These are: Create subject-specific assessment objectives Assess a more significant proportion of higher order thinking skills such as analysis and evaluation Reduce the proportion of assessment on recall of knowledge Increase the assessment of fundamental skills in real-world contexts Use authentic source materials and scenarios Use more diagrams and other visual materials Use more structured questions which link together to vary the demand throughout the assessment Use language which is accessible to all levels of student ability Use a limited range of command words consistently Use improved level of response and point based mark schemes 1.2. Purpose of the assessments The purpose of the assessments is a summative test which will allow students to not only demonstrate what they know and can do but also give them and their teachers some formative information about areas of strength and development needs. The outcomes of the tests will allow: the students to judge how well they have mastered different aspects of the curriculum for that class; the teacher to understand how well the students have performed and identify broad areas of strength and improvement for their teaching of that class; CBSE to understand how well schools are adopting a competency-based education approach to identify areas of good practice which can be shared and thereby tailor and target training and support. Currently the adoption of teaching which supports competency-based education is not uniform in CBSE schools and a proportion of the teaching is to the text book and focuses on memorising knowledge. The assessments will support a move to competency- based education by assessing higher order thinking skills, as well as the underpinning knowledge, in line with the requirements of the relevant NCERT curricula (and the CBSE syllabuses for Classes 9 and 10). These assessments may well see students perform less well in early years of use because the teaching is not aligned to the assessment, but the aim is to achieve a washback effect from the assessments into the teaching pedagogy so that the results will improve with time. The Class 10 assessments can be used to help students prepare for the Standard X examinations but will not replace them. CBSE can use ideas from the assessment designs to feed into the Standard X assessments as they deem appropriate. 1.3. General approach to the design The assessments are medium stakes and should be sat under exam conditions but can be taken in a classroom in or across scheduled lesson time. The assessments will be managed and marked by the teachers and results will be made available to students by the teachers. These results will be a total mark and marks broken down by assessment objective and major areas of the domain (content to 12 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 Area Approach Assessment type The assessments will be written tests administered by teachers Reporting outcomes Assessments will be reported as total scores from teacher marking with a simple mechanism devised for teachers to show marks by assessment objectives and major domain area. Report breakdown of score to student at question level Content to be assessed Use NCERT curricula and CBSE syllabus for Class 6 to 10 assessments Content to be assessed The main areas of the domain will be identified and assessed every time but different aspects of these areas can be assessed in different assessments Content to be assessed The assessments will be designed to mostly assess the content from the relevant class but at times it will be necessary to reward students for showing what they know and can do from lower class work, particularly in maths and science where underpinning content is needed. Content to be assessed Content which can be assessed in a written exam including indirect assessment will form part of the assessment domain (e.g. science practical skills) Assessment Objectives (AOs) Create subject specific assessment objectives Assessment Objectives (AOs) Have consistent assessment objectives across classes but vary weighting Assessment Objectives (AOs) Higher order skills will be assessed in increasing proportions from Class 6 to class X Assessment presentation Use separate question papers and answer sheets Assessment structure Assessments will follow a set structure which will be predefined and will allow items to be written against. Assessment question types Design assessments to use authentic sources and artwork Managing demand Vary the demand of the assessment overall from low to high but with fluctuations throughout the assessment Managing demand Have question types spread across the assessment Assessment length Increase total assessment length from Classes 6 to 10 Assessment length Maximum total length of assessment will be three hours for Class 10 Assessment length Maximum length of any one assessment will be 2 hours Assessment length Time will be built into the English assessments for students to read source materials before answering questions. Optionality There will be no optional questions in the assessmentsbe assessed) so it is clear to students and teachers where strengths and development areas exist. The assessments will not be designed to create standardised scores or age standardised scores as this would be difficult to operationalise since it would require pre-testing of items, a large data capture and issue exercise by CBSE for tests in live use. 1.4. High level design principles13 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 Marks The relationship between the length of the assessment and the number of marks needs to be clarified - waiting for CBSE discussion to confirm. Assume about 1 \u00bd minutes per mark unless there is good reason not to (e.g. reading time for English). Mark schemes No half marks will be used in the assessments Mark schemes Mark schemes will be point based and level of response where appropriate Mark schemes Level of response mark schemes will be generic with indicative content Use of calculators Allow calculators to be used in science and one maths assessment but not the second maths assessment.14 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 1015 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 English 16 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 Assessment objectives - English reading This document sets out the assessment objectives for CBSE English reading and their percentage weighting for the CBSE end-of-year tests for the different Classes 6 to 10.

Overall assessment structure The 45-minute duration is split into two parts, each having a separate text on which to base questions. The duration for each part is approximately equal. The texts are referred to as Text A and Text B. The reading time is included in the assessment duration. The questions will cover key skills in three assessment objectives. AO1 and AO2 are each weighted at 40-48% of the reading section; AO4 is weighted at 12-16%. The questions assess skills in relation to unseen source materials. The relevant skills will have been practised during the year; there is no content to learn other than language knowledge. There are up to two slightly longer answer questions, assessing higher order skills: a personal response to Text A and/or B assessing AO4. All other questions are short answer or objective questions. The number of marks in total for each text will vary from between 10 and 15 marks. Source texts Source material for Text A should be informative by nature whereas source material for Text B should be from prose fiction. This is to facilitate breadth of reading skills. Source A texts may include letters, recounts, biographies and autobiographies, newspaper and magazine articles, webpages, advertisements (where words rather than images predominate), and explanations. The texts chosen should include factual information and ideas/opinions. Source B texts may include extracts from short stories and novels. The texts chosen should provide opportunities for students to respond personally to characters, settings, ideas, events, etc. Over time, a range of texts chosen should include texts offering perspectives about life at regional, No. Description of Assessment Objective AO1 Show understanding of explicit meanings AO2 Show understanding of implicit meanings and perspectives AO3 Comment on the effect of writers' use of language and structure AO4 Communicate a personal response to texts [what is read], supported by textual reference 18 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 national and global levels. Texts should not be chosen which have the potential to cause distress to students, for example, texts dealing with violence, abuse, the use of harmful substances, bereavement. The assessment structure is the same for Classes 6, 7 and 8. The progression in level of demand is marked by the different lengths of texts and by their level of linguistic challenge. For Class 6, each text should have approximately 150 words, with a maximum word count of 300-350 words across both texts. For Class 7, each text should have approximately 200 words, with a maximum word count of 400-450 words across both texts. For Class 8, each text should have approximately 250 words, with a maximum word count of 500-550 words across both texts. All texts should have: a title in bold a preamble in italics explaining the context (such as the writer, text type, time of publication, setting the scene for the text/extract) line numbers after every five lines. Dictionaries are not allowed in the examination. Difficult words in the opening sentences of a text should be amended or glossed to remove barriers to students' understanding of key points at the start of the text which might unduly affect their response to later aspects of the text. Glosses should be concise. Not all words should be glossed (particularly towards the end of a text), as this would remove a level of suitable challenge for more confident students.Assessment details Reading The questions on each text should work through the paper in order, with a generally increasing level of demand. This means that the final questions on each text should usually be based on the latter part of each text or refer to the whole text. All questions are compulsory. There are no options. Questions may begin with imperative verbs, known as command words or direct questions can be used instead: e.g. who/ what/ where/ when/ how/ point-based mark schemes.AOs targetedQuestion type Possible command words AO1 short answer & MCQIdentify Give Select/ Find and copy AO2 short answer & MCQIdentify Give Select AO4 slightly more extended answerExplain Comment on Give your opinion of19 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 CBSE end-of-year test assessment specification This document sets out the approach to the assessment for the following subject and class: Subject Class English 9 and 10Assessment title Section A: reading Duration 60 minutes Total number of marks 30 Percentage AO1 AO3 20% Percentage AO4 20% Assessment objectives The assessment objectives are of similar style and broadly similar demand to those used in international qualifications such as GCSE and IGCSE. Overall assessment structure The 1-hour duration is split into two equal parts, each having a separate text on which to base questions. The duration for each part is 30 minutes. The texts are referred to as Text A and Text B. The reading time is included in the section duration. The questions will cover key skills in all four assessment objectives. AO1 and AO2 are each weighted at 30% of the reading section; AO3 and AO4 are each weighted at 20%. The questions assess skills in relation to unseen source materials. The relevant skills will have been practised during the year; there is no content to learn for Section A. There are two extended answer questions, assessing higher order skills: a summary question on Text A assessing AO1 and AO2 an analysis question on Text B assessing AO3 and AO4. All other questions are short answer or objective questions. Source texts Source material for Text A should be informative by nature whereas source material for Text B should be from prose fiction or prose non-fiction that is more literary in style. This is to facilitate the setting of items targeting the relevant AOs. Source A texts may include newspaper articles, magazine articles, webpages, advertisements (where words rather than images predominate), brochures, marketing material or speeches. The texts chosen should include factual information and ideas/ opinions. Source B texts may include extracts from autobiographies or memoirs, travel writing, short stories, novels or speeches. The texts chosen should provide opportunities for students to respond No. Description of Assessment Objective AO1 Show understanding of explicit meanings AO2 Show understanding of implicit meanings and perspectives AO3 Comment on the effect of writers' use of language and structure AO4 Communicate a personal response to texts [what is read], supported by textual reference20 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 personally to the ways in which writers use language and structure to convey ideas, events, people/ characters, setting etc. Over time, a range of texts chosen should include texts offering perspectives about life at regional, national and global levels. Texts should not be chosen which have the potential to cause distress to students, for example, texts dealing with violence, abuse, the use of harmful substances, bereavement. The assessment structure is the same for both Class 9 and Class 10. The progression in level of demand is marked by the different lengths of texts and by their level of linguistic challenge. For Class 9, each text should have approximately 325 words, with a maximum word count of 630-670 words across both texts. For Class X, each text should have approximately 375 words, with a maximum word count of 730-770 words across both texts. All texts should have: a title in bold a preamble in italics explaining the context (such as the writer, text type, time of publication, setting the scene for the text/extract) line numbers after every five lines.Dictionaries are not allowed in the examination.

Question 7 will be marked using a level of response mark scheme.23 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 CBSE end-of-year test assessment specification This document sets out the approach to the assessment for the following subject and class: Subject Class English: Literature 9 and 10Assessment title Section C: Literature Duration 60 minutes Total number of marks 30 Percentage AO1 AO3 33% Percentage AO4 33% Assessment objectives The assessment objectives for Literature are the same as for the reading section, though the weightings differ. AO1 and AO2 are each weighted at 17%; AO3 and AO4 are each weighted at 33%. They are mapped to questions of similar style and demand to those used in international qualifications such as GCSE and IGCSE. Overall assessment structure This assessment specification is specifically for Class 10, aimed at set texts for that year. The template can also be used for Class 9 with its different set texts. The difference in level of demand of the assessment should be reflected in the choice of set texts for each year.The Literature assessment is currently the third and final section of the 3-hour CBSE paper. However, having the Literature assessment as a separate 1-hour paper for the end-of-class tests is likely to improve manageability of the paper for both students and teachers. Students are likely to perform better in a separate assessment of Literature rather than in the final hour of a combined language and literature paper. Teachers may find a discrete 1-hour Literature assessment gives them greater flexibility in scheduling the assessments. The 1-hour duration of the Literature section is split into two equal parts: Part 1: Poetry Part 2: Prose The duration for each part is 30 minutes. The questions will cover key skills in all four assessment objectives. AO1 and AO2 are each weighted at 20% of the Literature Section; AO3 and AO4 are each weighted at 30%. All questions assess skills in relation to prepared texts. The dominant item type for the Literature section is the extended answer question, a reasonable approach for the assessment of set texts that have been studied in class and an approach common to GCSE and IGCSE assessments in Literature. However, there are some short answer items that provide a relatively gentle lead-in to the extended question on Poetry. No. Description of Assessment Objective AO1 Show understanding of explicit meanings AO2 Show understanding of implicit meanings and perspectives AO3 Comment on the effect of writers' use of language and structure AO4 Communicate a personal response to texts [what is read], supported by textual reference24 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 There are two extended answer questions, assessing higher order skills: an analysis question on poetry assessing AO3 an evaluation question on a prose text, where the dominant assessment objective is AO4. Dictionaries are not allowed in the examination. Set texts Poetry Students are expected to study all 11 poems in the set texts list during the course of the year. One poem will be printed on the question paper so that items can be set that require analysis of the detail of the poem, with the dominant focus on AO3, analysing the ways in which the writer uses language and structure to achieve particular effects. This will assess those analytical skills practised in lessons during the year. Over time, many of the poems will be assessed, but CBSE should avoid predictability, meaning they should not set all the poems in order until the last one on the list has been assessed. Ideally, the set list of poems should be refreshed at intervals, perhaps introducing three 'new' poems (at the same time as removing three 'old' poems) every 2-3 years. ProseCBSE should ensure that all students have questions set on the prose text they have studied. Having fewer texts of a similar level of challenge will assist in achieving comparability of demand across this part of the Literature section of the overall paper. The current discursive essays require extended personal responses to the set prose texts. The proposed general essay questions, also discursive, require a closer focus on the text. The dominant assessment focus is AO4, giving developed personal responses to their chosen text, supported by relevant textual references. Extended answers will be marked using levels descriptors, which reflect the dominance of AO4 but also understanding of explicit (AO1) and implicit (AO2) meanings. Because the set prose texts are not allowed in the examination, close analysis of writers' techniques (AO3) is not assessed. Assessment details Section C: Literature Examples of assessment items are provided for the items in blue. Part 1: Poetry The poetry question is compulsory.

To what extent?Questions 1 and 2 will be marked using point-based mark schemes. Question 3 will be marked using a level of response mark scheme. Part 2: Prose There are optional questions for each set text studied. 26 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 The following is a generic Part 2 question on character as an example of the type of question which should be produced: How far do you think X is an admirable character? [OR pitiful, unlikable etc.] In your answer, you should: describe aspects of the character you admire explain aspects of the character (if there are any) that you dislike comment on the ways in which X interacts with other characters. Use references to the text to support your answer. Other questions on prose texts might focus on themes or aspects of setting, which would be possible for both fiction and non-fiction set texts. The example above provides both bullet points for supporting students in developing their response and also a reminder to use textual references for substantiating their argument. Question 4 will be marked using a level of response mark scheme. Indicative content Mark schemes should contain 6 possible points, two for each bullet point in the question. They should be prefaced by: Students may comment on the following points, though they are not required to do so. Any valid point that can be reasonably supported should be accepted. Level descriptors for question 4 Note that the first and second bullets refer to the dominant AO4 (weighted at 10 out of the 15 marks). The third bullet refers to both AO1 and AO2 (weighted together at 5 out of the 15 marks).

CBSE example assessment item: English reading 7 This example assessment item illustrates the type of approach that is taken to end-of-class assessments for CBSE schools. Subject Class English reading 7 Source Text B In this story, two boys talk about some news from their local wildlife reserve. A wildlife reserve is an area where wild animals, such as tigers, are protected by teams of rangers. The story is located in the Sunderbans (islands near Kolkata). . 5 10\"Neel,\" called Viju. \"One of the new tiger cubs has escaped!\" Neel gasped. This was big news. The wildlife reserve's hungry, thin female tigers gave birth so rarely nowadays. When three cubs were born ten weeks ago, rangers* visited all fifty or so of the inhabited islands to share the good news. Neel leaned forward in excitement. \"How did it get out? Was it a boy or a girl cub? Where do they think it is now?\" \"One question at a time!\" Viju said. \"It clawed a small hole in the fence. It is the girl cub; the boys are still with their mother. And as for where it is? They say it's on our island but they don't know exactly where.\" \"Here?\" Neel jumped to his feet as if an enormous man-eating tiger were about to pounce on him. \"Relax,\" Viju said. \"It's still tiny. Ten weeks old. Not much bigger than a small cat.\" rangers - people who work in a wildlife reserve to care for the animals Adapted from Tiger Boy by Mitali Perkins published by Charlesbridge Question(s) 1.

Subject Class Assessment English 9 Reading Text A Text A Plastic Pollution This is from a 2017 magazine article by the television naturalist David Attenborough. We must act now to protect our oceans from the deadly threat of plastic. For me, there was no scene in the Blue Planet II series more heart-rending than one in this week's programme. In it, as snowflakes settle on the ground, a baby albatross* lies dead, its stomach pierced by a plastic toothpick fed to it by its own mother, having mistaken it for healthy food. Nearby lies plastic litter that other hungry chicks have regurgitated. Being fed lethal plastic debris is a risk that every young albatross now faces. This one scene symbolises a major problem that today threatens all sea creatures worldwide. Plastic is now found everywhere in the ocean, from its surface to its greatest depths. There are fragments of nets so big they entangle the heads of fish, birds and turtles, and slowly strangle them. Other pieces of plastic are so small that they are mistaken for food and eaten, accumulating in fishes' stomachs, leaving them undernourished. And while in the sea, this debris may combine with other toxic chemicals that we have dumped in the ocean adding, some suspect, to the chemical contamination* that we're already seeing in a variety of sea creatures. Every year, we dump around eight million tonnes of plastic into the sea. When ingenious chemists invented plastics over a century ago, the manufacturers proudly announced that this new material was, most wonderfully and valuably, indestructible. It would never wear out. No one at the time, apparently, asked the question of what happened to this extraordinary new kind of marvellous material after we have finished with it. Now we know. It kills. Yet all is not yet lost. We can, right now, reduce the amount of plastic that we use in our everyday lives. Already many companies have realised the danger and have taken measures to reduce the amount of plastic bags and packaging they use.

The exams grew nearer. Not three, not two, but only one month to go. I had to stop daydreaming and set myself tasks for every day and remind myself constantly to complete them. It grew so hot I had to give up strolling on the paths and staked out a private place for myself under a tree. I noticed the tension tightening the eyes and mouths of other students - they applied themselves more diligently to their books, talked less, slept less. Everyone looked a little demented from lack of sleep. Our books seemed attached to our hands as though by roots, they were part of us, they lived because we fed them. They were parasites and, like parasites, were sucking us dry. We mumbled to ourselves, not always consciously. Chipmunks jumped over our feet, mocking us. The gram seller* down at the gate whistled softly 'I'm glad I never went to school, I am a bul-bul*, I live in Paradise...' My brains began to jam up. I could feel it happening, slowly. As if the oil were used up. As if everything was getting locked together, rusted. The white cells, the grey matter, the springs and nuts and bolts. I yelled at my mother - I think it was my mother - 'What do you think I am? What do you want of me?' and crushed a glass of milk between my hands. It was sticky. She had put sugar in my milk. As if I were a baby. I wanted to cry. They wouldn't let me sleep, they wanted to see my light on all night, they made sure I never stopped studying. Then they brought me milk and sugar and made clicking sounds with their tongues. I raced out to the park. I think I sobbed as I paced up and down, up and down... gram seller - seller of small items bul-bul - nightingale, 'bird of a thousand songs'5 10 1562 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 Question 4 In the text, the writer portrays the pressure the narrator feels as he studies for his examinations.

This will allow a reasonable coverage of both the content of the CBSE syllabus and the NCERT curriculum but ensures that the assessment remains manageable for schools to administer and students to sit without it being overly burdensome. The AO weighting is the primary driver for the design of the assessment and the questions it contains as this will govern the skills that the students are expected to exhibit and is related to a competency- based curriculum where students can do more than recall facts but are able to apply these facts to different contexts and analyse and evaluate scientific data. Given the competing demands of meeting the requirements for the AOs and the content set out in the CBSE syllabus and the NCERT curriculum aspects, the weighting of the content coverage and the NCERT curriculum aspects have been allocated a range to allow assessments to be created which will No. Description of Assessment Objective AO1 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of scientific ideas, techniques and procedures. AO2 Apply knowledge and understanding of scientific ideas, techniques and procedures to classroom and real- world situations. AO3 Analyse scientific information and ideas to present data and interpret patterns and relationships. AO4 Evaluate scientific information to: make judgments and draw conclusions develop and improve experimental procedure.146 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 meet both requirements. The weighting of the content coverage is related to the overall teaching time allocated to it in the syllabus and the weighting of the NCERT curriculum aspects is related to the types of AOs covered and nature of the content allocated. The assessment will be formed from structured short answer and objective questions based on a common source or stem which will build in difficulty through their sub-parts to allow all students to be able to access at least some questions throughout the assessment yet challenge the more able. There will be between six to nine structured questions in the assessment which will be worth between 3 and 9 marks each. There will also be a small number of stand-alone single mark objective and short answer questions at the start of the assessment (3-6) to allow a balance of content coverage to be easily achieved and manage the weightings of AOs appropriately. Assessment details There are six major aspects of the NCERT curriculum which will be assessed in the end-of-year Class 6 test and each aspect will need to be sampled in every assessment. The table below shows the range of marks that will be covered by each of the different aspects of the curriculum. A range is necessary to accommodate the different AO weightings and cover the different content areas. Section Title Marks 6.1 Scientific classification 7-11 6.2 Scientific investigation and causal effects - processes and phenomena11-15 6.3 Measurement of physical properties 3-6 6.4 Drawing, presenting, analysing and interpreting data 7-11 6.5 Scientific models and creativity 3-6 6.6 Application of scientific information to real life 8-12 The number of marks available for each aspect will vary as the nature of the aspect and volume of content is different. These aspects are related to both the assessment objectives and the high level content themes so it means that each lends itself more or less readily to different types of question. For example, 6.1 Scientific classification is mostly about recall of knowledge or application of this knowledge to a context so it focuses on AO1 and AO2 whereas 6.4 Drawing, presenting, analysing and interpreting data is mostly about applying knowledge and analysing data so it focuses on AO3 and AO2. The assessment of the practical skills in 6.3 Measurement of physical properties and 6.5 Scientific models and creativity will be through questions which test the student's knowledge of how to carry out practical tasks and achieve fair and valid results. Questions may approximate a student's ability to measure, for example by presenting a clear image of a thermometer and asking students to record the temperature shown. Beyond this, there will be no direct assessment of these practical skills but the questions will be written such that those students who have done the practical work will be able to answer them more easily.147 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 Structured questions will have a theme which runs through them but can link across different aspects and also between different content areas where appropriate. For example, a question may describe an investigation of plant growth and ask questions about the biotic factors that impact growth, the passage of light through the leaf, the practical investigation of the effect of light on growth and the disadvantages of using electric lamps. This links across 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.6 and covers parts of botany and light. All objective questions will require students to select from a list of possible options. The number of options will be at least three (so no True or False questions will be used) and will be dependent on the number of reasonable choices which a student can make. For example, there are three different elements which may be magnetic, but more choices of food sources of nutrients so the latter may require a selection to be made from four or five choices. Gap fill questions can be used but they need to be structured in a way which allows the candidates to write the answer on plain paper. Assessment rubrics There will be no optional questions in the assessments and students will be expected to attempt all questions. This is because it is very hard to ensure that optional questions are of the same demand and students are actually quite poor at selecting the question which they would be better placed to answer. Students will be allowed to use a calculator and will need access to a pen, pencil, ruler and graph paper.148 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 CBSE end-of-year test assessment specification: Class 7 This document sets out the approach to the assessment for the following subject and class: Subject Class Science 7Duration 1 hour 20 minutes Total number of coverageAcidity and Soils (20-30%) Organs and Systems (20-30%) Colour and Lenses (10- 15%) Electric Circuits (20-30%) Heat (5-10%) Assessment objectives Overall assessment structure There will be a single assessment to cover the Class 7 content which will last 1 hour 30 minutes and have 60 marks.

This will allow a reasonable coverage of both the content of the CBSE syllabus and the NCERT curriculum but ensures that the assessment remains manageable for schools to administer and students to sit without it being overly burdensome. The number of marks will allow students to understand how well they have done on each of the five high level content areas and each of the assessment objectives and this will help teachers identify areas of weakness for individual students and also for whole classes so they can focus their teaching appropriately. The AO weighting is the primary driver for the design of the assessment and the questions it contains as this will govern the skills that the students are expected to exhibit and is related to a competency based curriculum where students can do more than recall facts but are able to apply these facts to different contexts and analyse and evaluate scientific data. Given the competing demands of meeting the requirements for the AOs and the content set out in the CBSE syllabus and the NCERT curriculum aspects, the weighting of the content coverage and the NCERT curriculum aspects have been allocated a range to allow assessments to be created which will CBSE end-of-year test assessment specification: Class 9 This document sets out the approach to the assessment for the following subject and class: Subject Class Science 9Duration 2 hours Percentage coverageNature of matter (20-30%) The living world (20-30%) Movement and force (20-30%) Environment (10-15%) Food (10-15%) No. Description of Assessment Objective AO1 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of scientific ideas, techniques and procedures.

AO3 Analyse scientific information and ideas to present data and interpret patterns and relationships. AO4 Evaluate scientific information to: make judgments and draw conclusions develop and improve experimental procedure.155 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 Duration 2 hours Percentage AO1 30% Percentage AO2 30% coverageNature of matter (20-30%) The living world (20-30%) Movement and force (20-30%) Environment (10-15%) Food (10-15%) Section Title Marks 9.1 Scientific classification 3-4 9.2 Scientific investigation 6-8 9.3 Application of scientific investigation to daily life 5-7 9.4 Causal effects - processes and phenomena 5-7 9.5 Using data and calculating answers 7-9 9.6a Draw and present information 5-7 9.6b Analyse and interpret data 8-10 9.7 Understanding scientific theory and convention 5-7 9.8 Measure physical properties 1-2 9.9 Application of scientific theories and concepts 8-10 9.10 Draws conclusions 7-9 9.11 Describes scientific discoveries 2-3 9.12 Evaluates evidence 6-8meet both requirements. The weighting of the content coverage is related to the overall teaching time allocated to it in the syllabus and the weighting of the NCERT curriculum aspects is related to the types of AOs covered and nature of the content allocated. The assessment will predominantly be formed from structured short answer and objective questions based on a common source or stem which will build in difficulty through their sub-parts to allow all students to be able to access at least some questions throughout the assessment yet challenge the more able. There will also be one extended response item in the assessment to test students abilities to be able to produce coherent explanations. There will be between nine to 12 structured questions in the assessment which will be worth between 4 and 14 marks each. There will also be a small number of stand-alone single mark objective and short answer questions at the start of the assessment (3-6) to allow a balance of content coverage to be easily achieved and manage the weightings of AOs appropriately. Assessment details Curriculum coverage There are thirteen major aspects of the NCERT curriculum which will be assessed in the end-of-year Class 9 test and each aspect will need to be sampled in every assessment. The table below shows the range of marks that will be covered by each of the different aspects of the curriculum. A range is necessary to accommodate the different AO weightings and cover the different content areas The number of marks is proportional to the amount of content which can be assessed, the link between the aspect and the AO(s) covered and the relative importance of the area of study.156 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 The number of marks available for each aspect will vary as the nature of the aspect and volume of content is different. These aspects are related to both the assessment objectives and the high level content themes so it means that each lends itself more or less readily to different types of question. For example, 9.1 Scientific classification is mostly about recall of knowledge or application of this knowledge to a context so it focuses on AO1 and AO2 whereas 9.5 Using data and calculating answers is mostly about analysing data and applying knowledge so it focuses on AO3 and AO2. The assessment of the practical skills in 9.2 Scientific investigation and 9.8 measures physical properties will be through questions which test the student's knowledge of how to carry out practical tasks and achieve fair and valid results. There will be no direct assessment of these practical skills but the questions will be written such that those students who have done the practical work will be able to answer them more easily. Teachers could be asked to assess these practical skills separately through the set list of experiments which appear in the CBSE syllabus. This could take the form of a laboratory book detailing a write up of the experiments carried out with teacher annotation about how well they actually did the practical tasks. The questions designed to assess 9.12 Evaluate evidence will cover whether students understand the evidence they are presented with and its potential limitations but it is not possible to design an assessment of whether they believe this evidence to be correct in an assessment of this nature. This is because the student can respond with what they think the teacher will want rather than their actual belief. The only aspects of the NCERT curriculum which will not be covered is observing technological devices and designing models as these focus on students making things and this is not possible to assess in a written assessment format. Again this could be covered in a teacher assessment with a portfolio of evidence produced containing photographs of what they have made and notes about the devices they have studied with teacher annotation explaining how well they have completed the work. Question styles Structured questions will have a theme which runs through them but can link across different aspects and also between different content areas where appropriate. For example, a question may present a velocity time graph for a car and ask questions about the car's speed, the amount of energy it uses and then the impact of the burning of petrol on the environment. This links across 9.5, 9.6b and 9.9 and covers parts of Movement and force and The environment. All objective questions will require students to select from a list of possible options. The number of options will be at least three (so no True or False questions will be used) and will be dependent on the number of reasonable choices which a student can make. For example, there are three different choices as whether a substance is an element a compound or a mixture but there are a larger number of choices which could be made in relation to internal cell structures so this may require a selection to be made from four or five choices. Gap fill questions can be used but they need to be structured in a way which allows the candidates to write the answer on plain paper. Extended response questions will be worth 4 marks and will always require students to explain theories, processes and phenomena or how these relate to every day life and scientific convention. They will be level of response marked as per the mark scheme below and indicative content will be provided to show the sort of content which could be covered by the student.157 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 Section Title Marks 4 Clear well structured explanation linking effects to causes or underpinning theory4 3 Clear description of relevant facts with some explanation relating effects to causes or underpinning theory.3 2 Description of the basic facts but no link of effects to causes or underpinning theory2 1 Limited isolated descriptive points relevant to the topic1 0 Nothing worthy of credit 0 Assessment details There will be no optional questions in the assessments and students will be expected to attempt all questions. This is because it is very hard to ensure that optional questions are of the same demand and students are actually quite poor at selecting the question which they would be better placed to answer. Students will be allowed to use a calculator and will need access to a pen, pencil, ruler and graph paper. 158 CBSE assessment framework for science, mathematics and English for Classes 6 to 10 Assessment objectives The assessment objectives are broadly based on levels of Bloom's taxonomy and are of similar style and demand to those used in other international qualifications such as GCSE and iGCSE.

The questions designed to assess 10.11 Evaluate evidence will cover whether students understand the evidence they are presented with and its potential limitations but it is not possible to design an assessment of whether they believe this evidence to be correct in an assessment of this nature. This is because the student can respond with what they think the teacher will want rather than their actual belief. Similarly it is not possible to assess whether a student actually changes their behaviour in 10.12 Uses science to change behaviour but the student will be expected to show they understand what they should do differently. The aspect of the NCERT curriculum related to communication is implicitly assessed in all other areas. Clear written communication will be needed in order for the teacher to be able to understand the answer and award the marks. The only aspects of the NCERT curriculum which will not be covered is observing technological devices and designing models as these focus on students making things and this is not possible to assess in a written assessment format. Again this could be covered in a teacher assessment with a portfolio of evidence produced containing photographs of what they have made and notes about the devices they have studied with teacher annotation explaining how well they have completed the work. Question styles Structured questions will have a theme which runs through them but can link across different aspects and also between different content areas where appropriate. For example, a question may ask a student to explore the process for extraction of a metal from its ore and then link this to the underlying chemical reaction and the impact of the process at an industrial scale on the local environment. This links across 10.1, 10.3, 10.5a, and 10.11 and covers parts of Chemical substances and Natural resources . All objective questions will require students to select from a list of possible options. The number of options will be at least three (so no True or False questions will be used) and will be dependent on the number of reasonable choices which a student can make.
