Their 28 ability to access cryptic epitopes conser ved across SARS -CoV-2 variants of concern ( VoCs) and feasibility 29 to engineer modular, multimeric designs, make these anti body fragments ideal candidates for 30 developing broad -spectrum therapeutics against current and continually emerging SARS -CoV-2 VoCs . 31 Here we describe a diverse collection of 37 anti-SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein nanobodies of n anobodies were 33 shown to have high intrinsic affinity; high thermal, the rmodynamic and aerosolization stability; broad 34 subunit/domain specificity and cross -reactivity across many VoCs; wide -ranging epitopic and 35 mechanistic diversity ; high and broad in vitro neutralization potencies ; and high neutralization efficacies 36 in hamste r models of SARS -CoV-2 infection , reducing viral burden by up to six order s of magnitude to 37 below detectable levels . In vivo protection was demonstrated with anti-RBD and previously unreported 38 anti-NTD and anti-S2 nanobodies . This collection of nanobodies provides a therapeutic toolbox from 39 which various cocktail s or multi -paratopic formats could be built to tackl e current and future SARS -CoV- 40 2 variants and SARS -related viruses. Furthermore, the high aerosol -ability of nanobodies provides the 41 option for effective needle -free delivery through inhalation. 42 43 Keywords: SARS , VHH, Nanobody, 46 47 48 49 .

As of 20 December , 2021, 275 million individuals 53 have been infected world -wide , of which ~5.5 million have died (coronavirus.jhu.edu ). The toll on public 54 health has been exacerbated with the continual emergence of SARS -CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs) 1, 2. 55 These VoC s, which include Alpha (B.1.1.7) , -19 vaccines and therapeutics to different extents , and the evolution ary 57 trajectory of the virus variants predicts newer VoC escape mutants to eme rge in the future 1-8. 58 59 Key to SARS -CoV-2 infection is its surface -displayed spike glycoprotein (S) 9-13, a homotrimeric protein 60 where each proto mer ectodomain format consists of S 1 and S2 subunits. S1 is further delineated by an 61 N-terminal , a domain (RBD) and . The s pike 62 glycoprotein mediates cell entry, a critical first phase in the infection process, involving two discrete but 63 concerted steps. In the first, virus -cell binding step, the RBD, essentially through its receptor -binding 64 motif ( RBM), binds to its host receptor angiotensin -converting enzyme II (ACE2). This is followed by the 65 second, virus -cell fusion step , which is media ted by the S2 subunit and concludes the viral cell entry 66 event. Spike glycoprotein is the primary target for COVID -19 therapeutic antibodies , which operate by 67 stopping virus cell entry via blocking the cell binding and/ or fusion step . In particular, the me chanism of 68 action of most potent neutralizing antibodies involve s binding to the RBD, although neutralizing 69 antibodies targeting the NTD domain 14-19 and the S2 subunit 20, 21 have also been reported. 70 71 While many COVID -19 immuno therap ies are based on monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ), single -domain 72 antibodies (mostly V HHs) are also being pursued as alternative therap eutics 22-48. VHHs (nanobodies) are 73 the variable domains of camelid heavy -chain antibodies responsible for antigen recognition . One 74 nanobody (VHH -72/XVR011) has already entered clinical trials for COVID -19 thera py 29, 39, 49. VHHs offer 75 over mAbs as COVID -19 immunother apeutics , most notably because of their 76 stability against aerosolization that allows for convenient, low-cost and effective needle -free delivery of 77 VHHs into the key site of infection (lungs ) by inhalation 40, 41, 50 -52. Importantly, VHHs permit modular 78 assembly of multimeric /multi -paratopic nanobody constructs with drastically improve d efficacy and 79 cross -reactivity /neutralization breadth across V oCs 34, 36. Multispecific VHH constructs can also be 80 designed to target confined geometric spaces on the surface of the ta rget antigen without nanobody 81 .

Critically , with small size and frequently extended 82 CDR3s , VHHs can reach cryptic epitopes that are mAbs and conserved across SARS -CoV-2 83 VoCs, allowing for the development of broad -spectrum nanobody therapeut ics against current and 84 future VoC s 34, 39, 40. 85 86 Here we report the isolation , extensive characterization and in vivo efficacy of a large panel of SARS - 87 CoV-2-targeting nanobodies . Monovalent V HH and bivalent V HH-Fc formats were assessed for binding 88 affinity ; thermal , thermodynamic and aerosol stability ; epitopic diversity ; S domain specificity; 89 cross -reactivity to multiple betacoronavirus subgenera and VoCs ; in vitro cross -neutralization potenc ies 90 against s everal VoCs ; and in vivo neutralization efficacies using a hamster model of infection . Multiple 91 neutralization mechanism s of action are possible through VHH binding to RBD, NTD, and S2, including 92 inhibiting the virus -cell binding and/or fusion steps. This robust collection of nanobodies provide s a 93 foundation for develop ment of effective broad -spectrum therapeutics (monotherapy, cocktails or 94 multimerics/ multi -paratopic s) that could tackle current and future SARS -CoV-2 variants and SARS - 95 related viruses. 96 97 2. RESULTS 98 2.1 Llama i mmunization and serum a nalyses 99 Prior to immunization, serology and panning experiments, purified SARS -CoV-2 spike glyco protein (S) 100 antigens were validated for functionality in adsorbed/captured states on microtiter wells (Fig. S1; Table 101 S1). Two llamas (Green & Red) were immunized with SARS -CoV-2 Wuhan -Hu-1 (Wuhan ) S fragments . 102 Specifically, Green was primed with S and boosted with three doses of RBD fragment, whi le Red 103 received four doses of S. Both llamas produced a strong and specific immune response to S, S1, S2 and 104 RBD with Green consistently outperforming Red (up to 10 -fold) across all four target protein s (Fig. S 2A). 105 Analyses of total polyclonal sera by flow cytometry -based surrogate neutralization assays (SVNA) 106 showed a more poten t neutralizing antibody response generated by Green (Fig. S 2B). 107 108 2.2 Phage display library construction, selection and screening 109 Two phage display libraries , Green and Red , were constructed using day 28 peripheral blood 110 mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) and separately subjected to two rounds of panning against S fragments . To 111 further maximize for V HH diversity, p anning was performed under multiple selection conditions (P1 - P6; 112 see Methods ) to direct selection towards S -, S1-, S2-, RBD -, NTD .

Most V HHs originated from llama Green, 26 vs 11 from llama Red ( Fig. 1 A). Llama Green , which was 115 predominantly immunized with RBD , yielded a higher proportion of RBD -specific V HHs (15 RBD , six NTD , 116 five S2) compared to llama Red which was immunized with only S and yielded mostly S2-specific V HHs 117 (two RBD , three NTD , six S2). 118 Selected VHHs were then (i) fusions to the biotin ylation acceptor peptide (BAP) and His 6 119 tags and produced in E. coli ; and (ii) cloned in fusion with human IgG1 hinge -Fc domain (V HH-Fc) and 120 produced in HEK293 -6E cells . 121 122 2.3. Binding character istics of V HHs and V HH-Fcs 123 VHHs/VHH-Fcs were tested by SPR and ELISA against recombinant Wuhan SARS -CoV-2 S, S1, RBD, 124 NTD and S2 proteins to determine affinit ies and subunit/domain specificit ies (Fig. 1C; Fig. S3; Table S2; 125 Table S3 ). V HHs bound with high affinity , with the majority of KDs in the single -digit -nM to pM range. 126 Three clusters of V HHs were identified: 17 RBD -specific V HHs, nine NTD -specific V HHs (no reactivity to 127 RBD , bound S and S1 ) and 11 S2 -specific V HHs (Fig. 1 C). The domain specificity of the NTD binders was 128 confirmed in subsequent ELISAs ( Fig S3B; Table S3 ). By flow cytometry , VHH-Fcs bound SARS -CoV-2 S 129 (Wuhan) in a more natural context on the cell membrane of CHO cells (CHO55E1) stably transfected with 130 the S protein (Fig. 1D; Fig. S 4; Table 1 ). High apparent affinities ( EC50apps) in the single -digit-nM to pM 131 range were observed for the majority o f VHH-Fcs. 132 VHHs were examine d for cross -reactivity to a collection of spike glycoprotein fragments from various 133 coronavirus genera and SARS -CoV-2 variants by ELISA and SPR. In ELISA (Fig. 2A; Table 1 ), many VHH-Fcs 134 cross -reacted with the S protein from VoCs Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Kappa (B.1.617.1 ; Variant 135 Being Monitored [VBM] ). The e were : 1) RBD -specific VHHs 02/05 and 04/14/15 did not cross - 136 react with Beta and Gamma , and Kappa, respectiv ely, and 2) S2 -specific V HHs MRed18 and MRed19 did 137 not cross -react with Kappa . All nine NTD -specific VHHs cross -react ed with all variants tested . Additionally, m any VHHs cross -reacted with pangolin CoV, with fewer cross -reacting to SARS -CoV, SARS - 139 like CoV SARS viruses all of the 140 Betacoronavirus Sarbecovirus subgenus. None of the antibodies tested cross -reacted with the remaining 141 11 non-Sarbecovirus Betacoronavirus, Alphacoronavirus, Delta coronavirus or Gammacoronavirus . The 142 broadly cross -reactive antibodies included VHHs targeting all three regions of the S protein (RBD, NTD, 143 S2). T he most broadly cross -reactive VHHs recognizing 10 - 11 viruses , including SARS -CoV-2 variants , 144 RBD binders and six S2 binders 145 .

The panel of V HHs had similar cross-reactivity profiles to human ACE2 , except that ACE2 did not 147 bind civet SARS -CoV S and, unsurprisingly, bound HCoV -NL63 S (Fig. 2A ) 53, 54. 148 149 When tested by SPR against SARS -CoV, 11 out of 14 ELISA -positive VHHs cross -reacted with SARS - 150 CoV S , most with comparabl y high affinities (Fig. 2B; Table 1; Fig. S5A; Table S4 ). Seven of V HHs 151 were S2 -specific, three RBD -specific and one NTD -specific. Against the Alpha and Beta variants , the SPR 152 cross -reactivity data , performed with all RBD, all NTD and five S2 V HHs (31 V HHs), were consistent with 153 ELISA, except for 04 and 14 which w ere negative or very weak for binding to the Beta variant by SPR . All 154 31 VHHs bound the Alpha variant S protein , 28 of which were also cross -reactive to the Beta variant S 155 protein (Fig. 2C; Fig S5B; Table 1; Table S 4). Thirteen out of 17 RBD -specific V HHs bound all three 156 variant s with similar affinities, except for VHHs 10, 15 and 17 which bound to the Beta variant with 40 - 157 50-fold weaker affinity ; the remaining four that did not bind the Beta variant showed cross -react ivity 158 with the Alpha variant with similar (04, 14) or reduced ( ~5-fold [05] and ~20-fold [ 02]) affinity relative to 159 the Wuhan variant. All nine NTD -specific and five S2-specific V HHs cross -reacted with the three vari ants 160 with essentially the same affinities . The loss of binding for some of the ELISA -positive nanobodies in SPR 161 assays could be due to the loss of binding avidity (V HH-Fc was used in ELISA vs VHH in SPR) and/or 162 epitope hindrance on the sensorchip. In agree ment with this, VHH 20 (ELISA+/SPR-) neutralizes SARS -CoV 163 in surrogate virus neutralization assays (see below) as a VHH-Fc format ; so do VHH-Fc 18 and SR13 which 164 were false negative s by both ELISA and SPR, additionally demonstrating the number of SARS -CoV cross - 165 reacting V HHs exceeds that gleaned from the ELISA and SPR data . 166 167 2.4. Stability characteri stics of V HHs 168 By size exclusion chromatography (SEC) , all tested VHHs were aggregation -resistant (Fig. 3A; Fig. S 6). 169 VHHs were highly thermostable : with the ex ception of VHH 11, MRed25 and S2A3 and which had Tms of 170 ~ 60 - 61\u00b0C, the remaining 30 VHHs had higher Tms of ~65 - 80\u00b0C (median : (Fig. 3B; Fig. S 7; Table 171 S5). Conformational stability of V HHs was determined by measuring free energy of unfolding (G0) in 172 GdnHCl equilibrium denaturation experiments , with G0 rang ing - 53.4 kJ/mol (median: 30.7 173 kJ/mol ), and an m value range of 10.3 - 19.8 kJ/M*mol (median : 14.6 kJ/M*mol ) observed (Fig. 3C ; )55-59. 175 176 .

W e chose 1d VHH-Fc as a representative and included VHH -72 VHH-Fc, 178 whose modified /enhanced version is curre ntly in a phase 1 clinical trial, as a reference. Hamsters were 179 injected intraperitoneally (IP) with 1 mg of each antibody and serum antibody concentration was 180 monitored for up to four days by ELISA . Significant and comparable VHH-Fc concentrations were present 181 in the hamster sera for both 1d and VHH -72 VHH-Fcs on day s 1 and 4 post injection (Fig. 3D), indicating 182 VHH-Fcs would have the required serum stability and persistence in vivo for the duration of the animal 183 studies . 184 185 VHHs were also examined for their aggregation resistance and stability upon aerosolization. For a 186 few V HHs, aerosolization induced soluble aggregat e formation as determined by SEC , while for others it 187 led to the formation of visible aggregate s (Fig. S9 ; Table S6 ). This resulted in reduced % recover ies, 188 measure s of V HH stability against aerosolization , and corresponding to the proportion of V HHs that 189 remained as soluble monomer following aerosolization (Fig. 3 E; Fig. S9; Table S6). The majority of V HHs 190 (18 out of 28 VHHs tested ), however , were stable against aerosolization with high % recoveries (Fig. 3E ). 191 Additionally, s everal V HHs still showed a high % recovery upon aerosolization (5 0 - 70 %) despite the 192 formation of some visible aggregates . Comparison of ELISA -derived EC50s of select pre-aerosolized vs 193 post -aerosolized VHHs clearly demonstrated aerosolization did not compromise the binding activities of 194 VHHs (Fig. 3E ; Fig. S9). 195 196 2.5. Screening for neutralizing V HHs by surrogate virus neutralization assays (SVNAs) 197 A preliminary screen of 25 VHHs (14 RBD -specific, six NTD -specific and five S2-specfic) by ELISA - and 198 SPR-based SVNA s identified several potential neutralizers , predominantly from RBD -binding cohort 199 Table S7 ). A more relevant SVNA , which assessed the ability of antibodies to block binding of S 200 to Vero E6 cells displaying ACE2 , was then used as a screen to identify neutralizing V HHs and VHH-Fcs. 201 Neutralizing V HHs displayed similar potencies ( IC50: 5 - 21 nM) and outperformed the benchmark VHH - 202 72 (IC50: 59 nM) by as much as 12 -fold (Fig. S11; Table 2 ). Compared to V HHs, a larger number of V HH-Fcs 203 demonstrated neutralization capabilities (Fig. 4A; Fig. S12 ; Table 2 ). While neutralizing monomer VHHs 204 did not benefit from reformatting (except for the VHH -72 benchmark), sev eral non -neutralizing V HHs 205 (three RBD -specific and three NTD -specific ) benefitted profoundly from reformat ting and were 206 transform ed into neutraliz ers that had potencies similar to other RBD 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Second , while all Wuhan 211 neutralizers also remained Alpha neutralizers, some lost their cap ability to inhibit Beta, Gamma, Delta 212 and Kappa with variable cross -neutralizing patterns. In particular , with respect to the RBD -specific V HHs, 213 the cross -neutralization profiles for Beta vs Gamma and Delta vs Kappa were identical, similarly 214 reflecti ve of the key escape mutations in the se variants (K417N, E484K and N501Y for Beta vs K417T, and N501Y for Gamma ; L452R and T478K for Delta vs L452R and E484Q for Kappa) . Third, and 216 importantly, 12 out of 20 VHH-Fcs ( 10 RBD -specific, two NTD -specific) were nine of which ( eight RBD -specific, one NTD -specific) neutralized across all variants. The of these nine 218 pan-neutralizers ( six RBD -specific, one NTD -specific) also neutralized SARS -CoV. 219 220 2.6. Screening for neutralizing V HHs by pseudo typed and live virus neutralization assays 221 Using a pseudo typed virus neutralization assay (PVNA) , all 15 RBD -specific V HHs tested were found to 222 be neutralizing , and with the exception of 06 (IC50 range : 39 - 196 nM; median : 48 nM) (Fig. S1 3A; Table 2 ). For NTD -specific VHHs, three 224 of nine were neutralizing : two with similar IC50s of 188 nM (SR01) and 269 nM (SR03) IC50 of 41 nM (SR13) , comparable to the most potent RBD -specific V HHs. Reformatting to V HH-Fc had a 226 universal enhancing effect on neutralization potencies of V HHs irrespective of epit ope bin origin (Fig. 4A; 227 Fig. S1 3B; Table 2 ( ) of 2 - 100-fold were 228 observed; only one V HH (18) was unaffected with reformatting (IC50 range : 2.3 - 30.8 nM; median nM; 4 of 9 non However, bivalency also significantly improved ( ~9-fold) the potencies of 231 SR01 and SR03 and transformed a non -neutralizing V HH (SR16) into a potent neutralizi ng V HH-Fc. 232 Consistent with the aforementioned SVNA results and previous data 29, the VHH -72 benchmark also 233 improved , elevat ed from a weak V HH (IC50: 490 All - -specific HH-Fcs that were neutralizing by PVNA were also neutralizing in a live 237 virus neutralization assay (LVNA) (Fig. 4A; Table 2; Fig. S1 4). However, compared to the former method , 238 the LVNA IC50 values were lower and more variable . For RBD -specific V HH-Fcs an IC50 - 76 239 nM; median: 2.8 nM) was observed.

Bin 1 neutralizers , to which VHH -72 belonged and 242 displayed a similar IC50 (8.5 nM), exhibited intermediate potencies (range: 1.9 - 11.2 nM; median: 243 nM), followed by bin 5 9.9 nM; median: 58 244 potencies were observed with NTD -specific V HH-Fcs. Here, six of nine VHH-Fcs, representing at least one 245 epitope bin, were neutraliz ing. Interestingly, three new neutrali zers emerged from the pool of S2 - 246 specific V HH-Fcs using the LVNA, with S2A3 the most potent . 247 248 The LVNAs were extended to include Alpha and Beta variants. With the exception of V HH-Fc 06, all 249 remaining 16 RBD -specific Wuhan neutralizers maintained their ab ility to neutralize Alpha (Table 2: Fig. 250 4C; Fig. S15 ). Interestingly, m any V HHs from across different epitope bins showed improved IC50s by as 251 high as 15-fold. Except for 05 , which despite showing a reduced potency towards the Alpha variant ( ~40- 252 fold) sti ll exhibited the highest potency of all against the variant , the remaining VHHs demonstrated 253 comparable potencies . Of the 16 Wuhan/Alpha neutralizers, 13 also neutralized the Beta variant , with 254 the majority (10 of 13) demonstrating comparable potencies and two (14 and 17) show ing reduc tions 255 (~10-fold). Although from the most potent bin (2/3/4), 02, 04 and 05 , consistent with the cross -reactivity 256 data ( Fig. 2A ), were completely abrogated presumably by the RBD (K417N, E484K, 257 N501Y), seve ral others including and 15 did retain their high neutralizing potencies against 258 both Alpha and Beta variants. A similar trend was observed for the NTD -specific neutralizing VHHs: 259 against the Alpha variant, potencies either remained essentially the same as those for the Wuhan 260 variant or improved, while against the Beta variant, potencies diminished . Nonetheless , SR01 and SR16 261 maintained decreased with variants. However, the lead S2A3 still maintained 263 comparable potencies across all three variants ( IC50 of 12.2 nM, 31 nM and 54 nM for Wuhan , Alpha and 264 Beta [Table 2 ]). Collectively, the neutralization profiles across Wuhan, Alpha and Beta variants were 265 consistent with cross -reactivity profiles (Fig. 2A ). Based on the cross -reactivity (Fig. 2A ) and surrogate 266 cross -neutralization data (Fig. 4B ; Table S8 ), it is likely that many V HHs would also neutraliz e the 267 Gamma, Kappa and Delta v ariants in LVNAs . 268 269 2.7. Epitope studies 270 To identify the number of non -overlapping epitopes, V HHs were subjected to epitope binning 271 experiments by SPR and sandwich ELISA.

A conceptually similar assay to SPR was also performed by sandwich 274 ELISA ( Fig. S 16B). From the 33 V HHs tested, 14 unique epitope bins wer e identified: si x for RBD -specific 275 VHHs, three for NTD -specific V HHs and five for S2 -specific V HHs (Fig. 5 A; Table 1 ). The benchmark VHH -72 276 binned with RBD -specific V HHs 1d, 07, 12, 18, 20 and MRed04. With the exception of V HH 04, all 277 remaining bin 1, 2, 3 and 4 V HHs (13 in total), as well as VHH -72, binned with ACE2, consistent with them 278 being potent neutraliz ers. The results of sandwich ELISA s extended to include variants Alpha, Beta, 279 Gamma, Delta and Kappa (Fig. S16C ), using lead V HHs from various bins as capture antibo dies, were 280 consistent with epitope binning as well as cross -reactivity ( Fig. 2A ) data . 281 282 Next, we investigated the conformational nature of the epitope bins at peptide spectrometry (HDX -MS) ( Table S 9).

There is a strong agreement between 285 HDX -MS profiles and previously described epitope bins and subunit/ domain specificity . A common 286 binding mode adjacent to the RBM and distant from known VoC mutations was observed for bin 1 ( Fig. 287 5B). This overlaps with core binding contacts of VHH -72 on SARS -CoV 29 where neutralization is achieved 288 by steric blocking of ACE2. The binding prof iles for the strongest neutralizers in bins 2 /3/4 overlap the 289 ACE2 binding site 10 and known conformational hotspots 60. It was not possible to further resolve 290 epitope divers ity within the context of this dataset, however it is evident that a range of binding 291 patterns exist s 61, 62, and th ere is a correlation between stabilizations spanning mutations in VoCs and 292 the loss /attenuation of neutralization (Fig. 5 B). Such granularity assists in understanding and predicting 293 neutralization potency as novel variants emerge. 294 295 Epitopes for bin 6 (V HH 03 and 11) span the C -terminus of the RBD and SD1 63 (Fig. 5B), explaining 296 why binding is limited to constructs containing SD1 ( Table S 2). Stabilization of the SD1 hinge responsible 297 for RBD motion highlights a potential inhibitory mechanism for V HH 11 64. While it is challenging to 298 delineate between an epitope and conformational effects based on HDX profiles alone, d istinct binding 299 responses with common conformational hotspots were observed for the NTD binders ( Fig. 5C; Fig. S17 ). 300 Interestingly, none of the NTD -supersite loops 14-17, 19, 65 -67 covered here displayed significant HDX shifts, 301 except for N4 stabilized by SR02, suggesting a range of binding modes beyond the NTD -supersite. 302 Further, s tabilizations partially overlap a previously described conformationally active epitope with low 303 .

Supersite binders appear to be vulnerable to escape 304 mutants 7, 14, 68, highlighting the importance of targeting and characterizing alternative NTD epitopes. 305 An epitope for S2A3 spanning the linker/CD/HR2 motifs 21 is described in Fig. 5 D. This region is 306 upstream of known S2 epitopes and is crucial for the structural transition required for virus -cell fusion 69. 307 We cannot rule out the involvement of other residues within CD/HR2 regions due to gaps in coverage. 308 Given that none of the mutations within the six SARS -CoV-2 variants overlap the epitope, the cross - 309 reactivity against the six variants ( Fig. 2A ) and cross -neutralization against Alpha and Beta (Table 2 ), we 310 predict similar neutralization potencies against the Gamma, Kappa and Delta variants. 311 312 Finally, epitope typing by denaturing SDS -PAGE and western blotting indicated 13 of the 37 V HHs 313 were recognizing linear epitopes, with the majority ( 9 out of 12) being S2-specific ( Table 1; Fig S1 8). 314 315 2.8. In vivo therapeutic efficacy of V HH-Fcs 316 The in vivo therapeutic efficacy of V HH-Fcs which were neutralizing by LVNA were assessed in a 317 hamster model of SARS -CoV-2 infection. Five V HH-Fcs were selected to cover a wide ra nge of important 318 attributes including in vitro neutralization potencies and breadth, epitope bin, subunit/domain 319 specificity and cross included three RBD -specific (1d, 05, -specific (S2A3 ) VHH-Fcs. Cocktails of two V HH-Fcs were also included to 321 explore synergy between the antibody pairs recognizing distinct epitopes within the RBD (1d/MRed05) 322 or RBD and NTD (1d/SR01). 323 324 Hamsters were administered IP with 1 mg of V HH-Fcs 24 h prior to intra nasal challenge with SARS - 325 CoV-2 Wuhan isolate. Daily weight change and clinical symptoms were monitored. At 5 dpi, lungs were 326 collected to determine viral titers. Viral titer decrease and reversal of weight loss in antibody treated 327 versus control animals w ere taken as measures of antibody efficac y. Animals treated with RBD binders 328 1d, 05, and MRed05 showed reduced lung viral burden by three , five and six orders of magnitude, 329 respectively, relative to PBS or V HH-Fc isotype controls, with 05 and MRed05 reduci ng viral to 330 Fig. 6A ). The RBD -specific VHH -72 benchmark caused a mean viral decrease of 331 four orders of magnitude. The NTD binder SR01, and interestingly, the S2 binder S2A3, were also 332 effective neutralizers, decreasing mean viral titers by four and three orders of magnitude, respectively. 333 Both 1d/SR01 and 1d/MRed05 cocktails decreased viral titers by 6 orders of magnitude to undetectable 334 levels of virus infection. While it was not possible to unravel potential synergies for 1 d/MRed05, as 335 .

Moreover, in accordance with the viral 338 titer decreases, a gradual reversal of weight loss in infected animals was observed with antibody 339 treatment starting on 2 dpi (Fig. 6B,C ). A strong negative correlation ( r = -0.9436; p <0.000 1) was 340 observed between weight change and viral titer at 5 dpi (Fig. 6D ). 341 342 Subsequent immunohistochemistry studies corroborated the viral titer and weight change results. 343 First, in agreement with the viral titer observations , substantial viral antigen (nu cleocapsid) reductions in 344 hamster lungs were observed with antibody treatments ( Fig. 6E ; compare non -treated PBS and isotype 345 controls to treated profiles). Although, small foci of viral antigen expression were detected in VHH -72-, 346 1d-, SR01 - and S2A3 -treat ed none were detected in 05 -, MRed05 -, 1d/SR01 - and 1d/MRed05 - 347 treated animals. Second, SARS -CoV-2 infection is characterized by an overt inflammatory response in the 348 respiratory tract accompanied by an increased infiltration of inflammatory immune cells, e.g., 349 macrophages and T lymphocytes, in the lung parenchyma 70. As expected, this was the case for the non - 350 treated PBS and isotype control groups. In contrast, we observed a substantial reduction of 351 macropha ges and T lymphocytes infiltrate in lung parenchyma with antibody treatment ( Fig. S19, S20). 352 The m ost dramatic decreases in the number of macrophages and T lymphocytes were seen with 05, 353 MRed05, 1d/MRed05 and 1d/SR01 treatment s. Interestingly, a reduction in inflammatory responses was 354 also associated with a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells in antibody -treated animals ( Fig. S 21). 355 Altogether, the viral titer, weight change and immunohistochemistry results consistently demonstrate 356 that a single dose o f several of our V HH-Fcs reduced viral burden, immune cell infiltration and apoptosis 357 in the lung s of infected hamsters. 358 359 3. DISCUSSION 360 The efficacy of COVID -19 therapeutic antibodies and vaccines is persistently being threatened by 361 emergence of new Vo C escape mutants, presenting a pandemic state with no end in sight. Developing 362 broad -spectrum antibodies that can neutralize current and emerging VoCs represents an effective 363 countermeasure against the current SARS -CoV-2 pandemic and future ones. 364 365 Two key structural features of nanobodies make them promising candidates as broad -spectrum 366 therapeutics. First is their ability to access epitopes on the surface of the spike glycoprotein that are 367 .

Second is their high modularity, allowing for their 368 rapid conversion into multimeric/multi -paratopic constructs with favorable manufacturability profiles . 369 Multimerization can lead to drastic increases in the efficacy of anti -COVID -19 nanobodies and broaden 370 their cross -reactivity across variants 29, 34, 36, 39. Significantly, the chance of developing multimeric/multi - 371 paratopic constructs with the desired cross -neutralization breadth impro ves with the diversity of 372 nanobody building blocks available . 373 374 With the goal of developing broad -spectrum therapeutics, we employed multiple immunization, 375 phage display library construction and panning strategies to identif y a diverse collection of nanobod ies. 376 These were extensively characterized as monomeric V HHs and homodimeric V HH-Fcs. Nanobodies were 377 shown to have high intrinsic affinity (single -digit nM -pM); high thermal, thermodynamic and 378 aerosolization stability; broad epitopic diversity falling into 14 different epitope clusters, broad 379 subunit/domain specificity, recognizing NTD, RBD, and S2 regions; broad cross -reactivities recognizing 380 up to 11 different Sarbecoviruses including several SARS -CoV-2 VoCs and high and broad in vitro and in 381 vivo virus n eutralization potencies/efficacies. Based on published results and our studies, a diversity of 382 neutralization mechanism s of action can be envisaged for the anti-spike glycoprotein VHHs, including 383 inhibiting the ACE2 -RBD interaction by direct competition, s teric hindrance, locking the RBDs in the 384 closed conformation and distorting the RBM, leading to inhibition of the virus -cell binding ( RBD - and 385 NTD -specific V HHs) 38, 71 -73 and inhibiting conformational rearrangement s leading to inhibition of virus - 386 cell fusion (NTD- and S2-specific VHHs)14, 16, 17, 74. 387 388 Our study also provides valuable insights into how various in vitro neutralization assays predict 389 antibody efficacy. The flow cytometry-based SVNA was shown to effectively identify neutralizing 390 antibodies that were RBD-specific, providing a viable alternative to the PVNA or LVNA, which are labor- 391 intensive, difficult to standardize, inconvenient and not readily accessible as they require operating in 392 biosafety level 2 or 3 labs. However, the SVNA occasionally missed NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies, 393 and, similar to the PVNA, failed altogether to identify neutralizing antibodies that were S2-specific. 394 Furthermore, the SVNA did not have the sensitivity of the LVNA to identify VHHs with wea ker potencies 395 or, similar to the PVNA, to fine-rank neutralizing antibodies. 396 397 For several reasons, the number of epitope bins (14) identified in the current study likely under- 398 estimates the number of actual distinct epitopes. First, VHHs that recognize (i) partially overlapping 399 .

Second , indicators of HDX footprints, epitope types, -reactivity profile s, neutralization potencies, 403 and cr oss-neutralization profiles not accounted for by affinity alone, are seen amongst V HHs within the 404 same bin. Thus, the repertoire of structurally and functionally distinct epitopes are more diverse than 405 what can be gleaned from epitope bin ning analysis alon e. 406 407 In vitro neutralization assays with the Wuhan SARS -CoV-2 variant showed that the majority of the 408 nanobodies were RBD -specific. Importantly, and to our knowledge for the first time, we demonstrate d 409 that several NTD - and S2 -specific VHHs we re also potent and efficacious neutralizers in vitro and in vivo . 410 Significantly, neutralizing nanobodies show ed high epitopic diversity, originating from a t least eight 411 different epitope clusters. The vast majority of these V HHs - including NTD and S2 V HHs - remain ed 412 potent in vitro neutralizer s against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Kappa variants as well. A sample 413 of in vitro neutralizing nanobodies, representing RBD -, NTD - and S2 -specific V HHs, were also shown to be 414 efficacious in vivo neutralizers as single VHH-Fcs or as paired combinations of V HH-Fcs that targeted RBD 415 and NTD, with some capable of complete viral clearance from hamster lungs. These results also confirm 416 the strong positive correlation between the in vitro and in vivo neutralization data and indicat e that the 417 remaining in vitro neutralizers should also be in vivo neutralizers. Moreover, given the broad cross - 418 reactivity and cross -neutralization profiles of many of these nanobodies, it is reasonable to expect these 419 pan-reactive antibodies will also eff ectively neutralize currently untested and emerging VoCs , e.g., 420 Omicron, and SARS -related viruses. 421 422 The VHH -72 benchmark nanobody, a modified, enhanced V HH-Fc version of which is currently being 423 developed for COVID -19 therapy, has the advantage of being br oadly neutralizing and bind ing to a highly 424 conserved cryptic epitope in the RBD region which is difficult to access with conventional mAbs 29, 39. 425 Here we have identified five VHH -72-like nanobodies (1d, 07, 12, 20, MRed04 ) that map to the same 426 epitope as VHH -72 and demonstrate similar cross -reactivity and cross -neutralization profiles in the V HH- 427 Fc format. In monomeric formats, however, the VHHs significantly outperform VHH -72, but whether they 428 would do the same aga inst the enhanced version of VHH -72 remains to be seen. A similar broad cross - 429 reactivity profile to VHH -72 was seen with two other neutralizing nanobodies (11, SR01) that by HDX/ MS 430 experiments map to different but well -conserved epitopes , 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The doubly pan -specific SR01/1d cocktail 432 completely clear ed hamsters of viral burden, making for a promising broad -spectrum combination 433 therapeutic. 434 435 With an abundance of neu tralizing nanobodies on hand, many possibilities exist for designing 436 optim ized multimeric/multi -paratopic therapeutic agent s. This is implicitly evident from our epitope 437 binning experiments performed against several SARS -CoV-2 variants (Fig. S16C), albeit they exemplified 438 a fraction of potential possibilities . A recent study showed that the neutralization capability of a 439 nanobody significantly increased when fused to a second, non -neutralizing nan obody in a bi -paratopic 440 format 43, 74. Thus, the pool of VHHs can be expanded to include the entire p anel of neutralizing and non - 441 neutralizing nanobodies in the current study, leading to a further exponential increase of multimer 442 possibilities. Including the same or similar ( same epitope bin) nanobodies in a multimer construct is 443 plausible given the trimeric nature of the spike glyco protein and its repetitive presentation on the 444 surface of the virus which should accommodate avid inter -protomer, intra -spike, and/or inter -spike 445 binding events . This is supported by the current data showing increased in vitro neutralization potency 446 of nanobodies with homodimerization. -spike glycoprotein complexes would reveal the relative positioning of nanobodies on the surface of the spike 448 glycoprotein and could be used as a guide for design ing high ly effective and broad -spectrum therapeutic 449 multimer s. A comprehensive, high through -put campaign involving small scale expression of multimers 450 followed by in vitro screening for broad neutralization can also be envisaged. 451 452 In summary, the nanobodies described here provide ample opportunities to develop broad -spectrum 453 COVID -19 prophylactic/therapeutics of good manufacturability and efficacy. They c an be complemented 454 with nanobodies described in the literature for specified performance, although such alternatives would 455 be lacking in the case of our unprecedented NTD - and S2 -specific nanobodies. The ability to aerosolize 456 our V HHs provides the option o f a cost -effective, patient -friendly, direct and effective delivery of 457 therapeutic nanobodies to the nasal and lung epithelia by inhalation 40, 41, 50 -52, 75. The nanobodies can 458 additionally be utilized to develop c ost-effective, highly sensitive detection/ diagnosis systems of desired 459 cross -reactivity specifications. Epitope type diversity further provides the flexibility of virus 460 detection/diagnosis under native and/or denaturing conditions. 461 462 463 .

Immunizations were performed at Cedarlane Laboratories (Burlington, Canada) 500 essentially as described 81, 82, using SARS -CoV-2 Wuhan spike glycoprotein fragments . Briefly, for priming, 501 both llamas (Green and Red) were injected with 100 \u00b5g of S in 500 \u00b5L PBS combined with 500 \u00b5L of 502 Freund 's Complete Adjuvant. For the three subsequent boosts (day s 7, 14, 21), Gree n was injected with 503 70 \u00b5g of RBD (ACROBiosystems, Cat# SPD-S52H6) whereas Red received 100 \u00b5g of S 78 at day 7 and 50 \u00b5g 504 of S on day s 14 and 21 all with Freund 's Incomplete Adjuvant. Experiments involving animals were 505 conducted using protocols approved by the National Research Council Canada Animal Care Committee 506 and in accordance with the guidelines set out in the OMAFRA Animals for Research Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 507 A.22 . 508 509 b) Serum ELISA. Llama sera were tested for antigen -specific immune response by ELISA essentially as 510 described 82, 83. Briefly, dilutions of sera in PBST were added to wells pre-coated with S, S1, S2 or RBD. 511 Negative antigen control wells were pre -coated with casein (100 \u00b5L of 1%) or dipeptidase ng/well Sino Biological, Cat#13543 -H08H ). Following 1 h incubation at room temperature, wells were 513 washed 10 times with PBST and incubated with HRP -conjugated polyclonal goat TX , Cat# A160 -100P) for 1 h at room 515 temperature.

Phage display library construction, selection and screening 543 a) Phage display library construction. On day 28, 100 mL of blood from each of the two llamas was 544 drawn and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified by f icoll gradient at Cedarlane 545 Laboratories . Two independent phage -displayed V H/VHH libraries were constructed from 5\u00d7107 546 PBMCs as described previously 81, 82, 84. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from PBMCs using TRIzol Plus 547 RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher, Cat# 12183555) following the manufacturer's instructions and used 548 to reverse transcribe cDNA with SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix supplemented with random 549 hexamer (Thermo Fisher, SO142) (dT) (Thermo Fisher, Cat# AM5730G) primers. H/VHH 550 genes were amplified using semi -nested PCR and cloned into the phagemi d vector pMED1, followed by 551 transformation TG1 (Lucigen, Middleton, WI , Cat#60502 sizes of 1\u00d7107 and 2\u00d7107 independent transformants for Green and Red, respectively. Both libraries 553 showed an insert rate of 95% as verified by DNA sequencing. Phage particles displaying the V HHs were 554 rescued from E. coli cell libraries using M13K07 helper phage (New England Biolabs, Whitby, Canada , 555 Cat# N0315S) as described in 81 and used for selection experiments described below. 556 557 b) Library selection and screening. Library panning and screening were performed essentially as 558 described 81, 82, 85, using SARS -CoV-2 Wuhan spike glycoprotein fragments as target antigens . .

Following the binding stage (P1 - 568 P5), wells were washed 10 times with PBST and bound phages were eluted by treatment with 100 mM 569 glycine , pH 2.2 , for 10 min at room temperature, followed by immediate neutralization of phages with 2 570 M Tris. Similar to P4, but elution of 571 bound phages carried out competitively with 50 nM human ACE2 -Fc following the washing step. 572 For all p annings, a small aliquot of eluted phage was used to determine th e titer on LB -agar/ampicillin 573 plates and the remaining phage were used for subsequent amplification in E.coli TG1 strain 81. The 574 amplified phages were used as input for the next round of selection as described above. 575 After two rounds of selection, 16 (Green) or 12 (Red) colonies from each of the P1 - P6 selections 576 were screened for antigen binding by monoclonal phage ELISA against S, S1, S2 and 577 individual colonies from eluted -phage titer plates were grown in 96 deep well plates in 0.5 mL 2YT 578 media/100 \u00b5g/mL -carbenicillin/1% (w/v) glucose at 37 \u00b0C and 250 rpm to an OD 600 of 0.5. Then, 1010 CFU 579 M13K07 helper phage was added to each well and in cubation continued for another 30 min under the 580 same conditions. Cells were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and 581 the pellets 500 \u00b0C. Next day, phage supernatants were recovered by centrifugation, diluted 3 - 583 fold in PBSTC and used in subsequent screening assays by ELISA. To this end, antigens were coated onto 584 microtiter wells at 50 ng/well overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Next da y, plates were blocked with PBSC, washed five 585 times with PBSTC, and 100 \u00b5L of phage supernatants prepared above were added to wells, followed by 586 incubation for 1 h at room temperature in an orbital shaking platform.

Standard SPR techniques were used for 636 binding studies. All SPR assays were performed on a Biacore T200 instrument 637 Canada ) with HBS -EP running buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 m M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% Tween 638 20, pH 7.4) CM5 sensor ( Cytiva ). Prior to SPR analyses all analytes in flow (V HHs, ACE2 639 receptor) were purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 75 Increase ( Cytiva ) in HBS -EP buffer at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min to obtain monomeric proteins. spike glycoprotein 642 fragments were immobilized on CM5 sensor chips through standard amine coupling (10 mM acetate 643 buffer, pH 4.0 , Cytiva ). On the first sensor chip, 1983 response units (RUs) of SARS -CoV spike 644 (SinoBiologica l, Cat#40634 -V08B), 843 human Fc Piscataway, NJ , Cat# Z03194, as an irrelevant control surface) were 646 immobilized. On a second sensor chip, 2346 RUs of SARS -CoV-2 S, 1141 RUs o f SARS -CoV-2 S1 and 1028 RUs of SARS -CoV-2 S2 subunit were immobilized. A third sensor chip contained 489 RUs of 648 RBD_short78. The theoretical maximum binding response for V HHs binding to these surfaces ranged from 649 224 - 262 RUs. An ethanolamine blocked surface on each sensor chip served as a reference. Single cycle 650 kinetics was used to determine V HH and ACE2 binding kine tics and affinities. V HHs at various 651 concentration ranges (from 0.25 - 4 nM to 125 - 2000 nM) were flowed over all surfaces at a flow rate 652 of 40 \u00b5L/min with 180 s of contact time and 600 s of dissociation time.

The ACE2 affinity was determined using similar conditions by flowing a 656 range of monomeric ACE2 concentrations (31.3 - 500 nM). SARS -CoV-2 spike glyco proteins from Alpha 657 and Beta variants were also tested by SPR and amine coupled using the conditions desc ribed above. All 658 affinities were calculated by fitting reference flow cell -subtracted data to a 1:1 interaction model using 659 v3.0 and MRed05, VHH-Fc formats were used in SPR experiments. Approximately 200 RUs of 661 VHH-Fcs (2 \u00b5g/mL) were captured on goat anti-human IgG surface s (4000 RUs, Jackson ImmunoResea rch, 662 Cat# 109-005-098) at a flow rate of 10 \u00b5L/min for 30 s . A range of SEC -purified RBD fragments ( Table ; 663 Beta ) at 0.62 - 10 nM were flowed over the captured V HH-Fc at a flow rate of 40 664 \u00b5L/min with 180 s of contact time and 300 s of dissociation. Surfaces were rege nerated with a 120 s 665 pulse of 10 mM glycine , pH 1.5, at a flow rate of 50 \u00b5L/min. Affinities were calculated from reference 666 flow cell subtracted sensorgrams as described above. 667 668 c) Domain specificity determination of V HHs by ELISA. VHHs which bound to S1 subunit but not to the 669 RBD domain in SPR assays were further examined by ELISA to determine if they were binding to the NTD 670 domain of S1. Briefly, S, S1, NTD and RBD were coated onto NUNC\u00ae Immulon 4 HBX microtiter plates at 671 100 ng/well in 100 \u00b5L PBS, pH 7.4 . Next day, plates were blocked with 200 \u00b5L PBSC for 1 h at room 672 temperature, then washed five times with PBST and incubated with fixed (13 nM) or decreasing 673 concentrations of V HH-Fcs diluted in PBSTC. After 1 h, plates were washed 10 times with PBSTC and 674 binding of V HH-Fc fusions was detected by incubating wells with 100 \u00b5L of 1 \u00b5g/mL HRP -conjugated goat 675 anti-human IgG. Finally, plates were washed 10 times with PBST and peroxidase activity was determined 676 as described in 4.2a.

Stability assays 696 a) Determination of aggregation resistance by SEC . Purified V HHs were subjected to SEC to validate their 697 aggregation resistance. Briefly, 2 mg of each affinity purified V HH was injected into Superdex 7510/300 purification system ( Cytiva ) as previously 699 described 87. PBS was used as the running buffer at 0.8 mL/min. Fraction s corresponding to the 700 monomeric peak were pooled and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. 701 702 b) Thermostability determinations by circular dichroism. To determine thermostability, V HH T ms were 703 measured by circular di chroism as previously described 87. Ellipticity of V HHs were determined at 200 704 \u00b5g/mL V HH concentrations and 205 nm wavelength in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. 705 Ellipticity measurements were normalized to percentage scale and Tms were determined from plot of % 706 folded vs temperature and fitting the data to a Boltzmann distributi on. 707 708 c) Isothermal chemical denaturation (ICD). All ICD experiments were performed with the automated 709 Hunky system (Unchained Labs, Pleasanton, CA), using Hunky Client software (v1.2). V HHs were 710 prepared in PBS buffer, pH 7.2 (Teknova, Hollister, CA , Cat#P 0191), and diluted by Hunky automation to 711 20 \u00b5g/m L. They were denatured using a linear dilution gradient of 0 - 5.52 M guanidine\u00b7HCl (Sigma, 712 Cat#G3272) and incubated for 2 h at 25\u00b0C. Samples were subjected to LED excitation at 280 nm, and 713 emission spectra of the V HH were captured by a CCD spectrometer from 300 - 720 nm. The Hunky 714 Analysis v1.2 Software automatically plotted the fluorescence intensity against denaturant 715 concentration, and generated a data fit curve for two -state transitions of each V HH. Al l samples were 716 analyzed by the Hunky software using the Barycentric Mean (BCM) except for 05 (348/342 nm 348 -420 nm) to .

The fraction denatured was automatically plotted against denaturant concentration to 719 confirm the two -state model. The denatured -induced unfolding of V HHs was considered to be reversible 720 based on their small size as sh own to be the case for small proteins and numerous times for V HHs 56-59, 88, 721 89. 722 723 d) Serum stability. Three female Syrian hamsters were injected intraperitoneally ( IP) with 1 mg of 1d or 724 VHH -72 VHH-Fc diluted in 20 0 \u00b5L PBS. Animal were bled on day 0, 1 and 4 post injection and their sera 725 were subjected to ELISA to detect their VHH-Fc levels . Briefly, ser a were diluted 1/6000 , in order to give 726 final A450nm readings of 1 in 15 min , and incubated 1 h at room temperature in wells coated with SARS - 727 CoV-2 Wuhan S 78. The binding of V HH-Fcs withi n the sera was detected five times with PBST and 729 peroxidase (HRP) activity was detected as described in 4.2a. The levels of 1d and VHH -72 V HH-Fcs in sera 730 were quantified by interpolating obtained A 450nm readings against A450nm vs [VHH-Fc] standard curves 731 generated with purified 1d and VHH -72 VHH-Fcs, respectively. 732 e) Aerosolization studies. Prior to aerosolization, 4 mg of each V HH were purified by SEC using a 733 Superdex 75 10/300 GL column ( Cytiva ) and PBS as running buffer, as described above . Protein 734 fractions corresponding to the chromatogram's monomeric peak were pooled, quantified and its 735 concentration adjusted to 0.5 mg/mL. One mL of each V HH was subsequently aerosoli zed at room 736 temperature with a portable mesh nebulizer (AeroNeb Solo, Aerogen, Galway, Ireland), which produces 737 3.4-m particles. Aerosolized V HHs were collected into 15 mL round -bottom polypropylene test tubes 738 (VWR , Cat#C352059) for 5 min to allow condens ation and were subsequently quantified and kept at 4 \u00b0C 739 until use. Then 200 \u00b5L aliquots of pre - and post - aerosolized V HHs were subjected to SEC to obtain 740 chromatogram profiles. Additionally, condensed V HHs were closely monitored for the formation of any 741 visible aggregates, and in cases where aggregate formation were observed, they were removed by 742 centrifugation prior to concentration determination, SEC analysis and ELISA. % soluble aggregate was 743 determined as the proportion of a V HH that gave elution volume s (Ves) smaller than that of the 744 monomeric V HH fraction. % recovery was determined as the proportion of a V HH that remained 745 monomer following aerosolization. 746 747 To assess the effect of aerosolization on functionality of V HHs, the activities of post -aerosoli zed V HHs 748 were determined by ELISA and compared to those for pre -aerosolized V HHs. To perform ELISA, S1 -Fc 749 (ACRO Biosystems , Cat#S1N -C5255) PBS to and 100 \u00b5L/well were coated 750 .
