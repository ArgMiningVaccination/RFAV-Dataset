However, sometimes it can fail, allowing germs to make us sick. Unpredictable weather, seasonal changes, stress, and your environment can adversely impact your immune system. This can make some people more susceptible to getting sick. Below we offer you ways to give your immune system a healthy boost and help improve your body's natural defenses against various virus/bacterial causing illnesses. Here are several simple ways to boost your immune system: Whole plant foods like vegetables, seeds, nuts, fruits, and legumes are rich in antioxidants that help decrease inflammation in the body, which is linked to many health conditions. The fiber in such foods feeds the healthy bacteria present in the gut. Plant foods are also high in several essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. This is the simplest way to boost the immune system. Poor quality sleep makes you more vulnerable to illness. Sleep for at least 7 hours each night to promote a strong and healthy immune system. Cold showers are considered beneficial for musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems, and they can also boost metabolism and mental health. According to [ recent reports](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325725), daily cold showers can increase the number of disease-fighting white blood cells compared to people who take hot showers. Relieving anxiety and stress is the key to having a healthy immune system. Long-term stress can cause inflammation and imbalances in your immune cell function. A combination of regular exercise, yoga, meditation, and soaking in a tub full of warm salt water are a few ways to reduce stress and feel more relaxed. Staying hydrated doesn't necessarily protect a person's body from viruses and germs. Adequate hydration of your organs and tissues is essential for your health. Not staying hydrated can hinder physical performance, mood, digestion, focus, and essential functions. Such foods are rich in beneficial bacteria called probiotics, found in the digestive tract. Several examples are probiotic yogurts, Kefir, Kimchi, Sauerkraut, Miso and Kombucha. Research suggests that a flourishing network of such bacteria can help the immune cells differentiate between healthy, normal, and harmful organisms in the body and alleviate the development of allergies and illnesses. Your mental health condition can influence your body's physical health in many ways. According to [medical reports](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-positive-mindset-can-help-your-heart-2019021415999), despite having a family history of heart disease and other risk factors, positive-minded people were less likely to have heart attacks than negative-minded people. Vitamin C supports cell function, protects the body against environmental oxidative stress, and helps in reducing the duration of illness. Some of the best food sources of vitamin C are fruits and vegetables, including strawberries, kiwi, and oranges. Vitamin D can enhance the body's immune response and protect the body from various respiratory conditions. It's often called the \"sunshine vitamin,\" as sunlight is considered the best source of vitamin D. This is one of the most common and simplest practices to avoid germ-causing illnesses. It is the most efficient method of preventing the spread of infectious germs. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to stay healthy and ward off contagious infections.
