This care is provided by your physician. Holistic health care addresses all aspects of your health including physical, mental, emotional, intellectual, spiritual, and occupational. This is the service we provide to all patients seen at Home of the Healing Arts. Integrative care services. Integrative health services are recommended and offered depending on your individual desires and needs. These services are contracted directly with the providers and are most often not directly covered by traditional health insurance. We recommend many of these therapies alone or in combination with other modalities to aid in both healing and maintaining an overall state of well-being. Following is a list of some integrative services with a simple explanation of each. There are well trained practitioners for each therapeutic modality. Some of these services are offered for individuals or in group workshops at Home of the Healing Arts. - Meditation Meditation is a state of thoughtless awareness. This can be a welcome state given that the average person has 60,000 thoughts each day, most of them negative (coulda, woulda, shoulda) or in the past or future. Meditation is not an act of doing, rather it is a state of awareness and being. Meditation can be a state attained whether sitting in a lotus position, preparing a meal, or walking. It does not take concentration, exercise or mental effort. To the contrary, it is an act of letting go of the thoughts that enslave us and keep us meeting the demands of the outside world instead of listening to the inner guidance that often is quite valuable. Meditation has been popular in the West for the last 70 years but it has been practiced in the Eastern parts of the world for thousands of years. There are many studies that clearly demonstrate that meditation can lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety and depression, increase cognitive clarity and increase the life of the very cells we are made from. Mind body medicine is a field that is blossoming in healthcare and meditation is an important aspect of improving health through the mind body connection. There is increasing evidence the meditation improves quality of life and reduces stress, which is at the root cause of many illnesses and diseases currently plaguing people worldwide. - Acupuncture Acupuncture is an ancient form of traditional Chinese Medicine that has been used to treat many health conditions for thousands of years. Acupuncture is the procedure of inserting and manipulating filiform needles into various points on the body to relieve pain or for therapeutic purposes. Acupuncture can be useful for relieving pain and also for a variety of other conditions. Acupuncture's use has been recognized by the United States National Institutes for Health, the National Health Service of the United Kingdom, the World Health Organization, and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. - Hypnotherapy Hypnotherapy is often used in order to modify a subject's behavior, emotional content, and attitudes, as well as a wide range of conditions including dysfunctional habits, anxiety, stress-related illness, pain management, and personal development. Many studies have been done on the effectiveness and application of hypnosis to a wide variety of psychological, medical, and behavioral issues. Multiple studies have shown hypnosis to be a valid therapeutic medium for treatment and management of a wide range of problems; including relief of chronic and acute pain, reducing general anxiety, tension and stress in a self regulated manner, treating insomnia in a way similar to other relaxation methods, alleviating symptoms associated with migraines, asthma, tension headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, hives, and also in enhancing outcome in weight reduction programs. People use self hypnosis to improve concentration, athletic performance, or to curb anxiety or phobias, as well as to aid in relaxation leading to a good night's sleep. - Massage Therapy Massage therapy has been practiced in many cultures around the world for thousands of years, including ancient Egypt, China, Japan, Arabic Nations and Greece. Today, people use many different types of massage therapy for a variety of health-related purposes. A National Health Interview Survey in 2007 found that an estimated 18 million U.S. adults and 700,000 children had received massage therapy in the previous year. People use massage to relieve pain, facilitate rehabilitation of sports injuries, increase relaxation, reduce anxiety and depression, and to enhance general overall wellness. Multiple clinical trials have shown massage to be useful for chronic low-back pain, neck pain, soft tissue injuries, and aiding in relaxation. Clinical practice guidelines issued by the American College of Physicians recommend that physicians consider using massage therapy as a complementary treatment for many musculoskeletal conditions. Massage therapy is a great way to reduce pain but many people use massage to stay well and ward off illness before it starts. The mind body connection is powerful and massage therapy is a great way to take care of the body and soothe the mind. - Reiki Reiki is a Japanese technique of \"laying on hands\" that is used to promote healing, stress reduction and relaxation. Reiki is based on the idea that we all have an unseen life force flowing through us and if the flow of our energy is low we are more likely to feel ill, stressed, and fatigued compared to when the flow of our life force is high we feel more healthy, happy and alive. Reiki is a combination of two Japanese words - Rei which means \"God's Wisdom or the Higher Power\" and Ki which is \"life force energy\". Reiki is then spiritually guided life force energy. Reiki treats the whole person including the body, emotions, mind and spirit, and can create a multitude of beneficial effects including feelings of peace, relaxation, and well-being. Reiki is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that everyone can use. It can be used in conjunction with all other medical and complementary treatments and has the benefit of no harmful side effects. People can go to a Reiki master for treatment or learn the Reiki healing method to use on themselves. Reiki is available to everyone and its use is not dependent on one's intellectual capacity or spiritual development. It is a spiritual form of healing but it is not tied to any particular religion nor does it depend on one's belief system or interfere with one's belief system. It has been successfully used by and taught to thousands of people of all ages, backgrounds and beliefs. - Yoga Though yoga has gained widespread popularity and many people think of yoga only as physical exercises and breathing to attain the asanas or poses, these are actually only the most superficial aspects of this profound science which offers a glimpse into the infinite potential of the human mind and soul. Yoga is an ancient practice of unifying individual consciousness with Universal consciousness. It is a simple process of reversing the ordinary state of energy and consciousness flowing outward to inward so that the mind can become capable of direct perception that is not dependent on external conditions and beliefs. In many cultures, we are taught to look outside of ourselves for fulfillment and we believe that we can find fulfillment by attaining material goods, status, and outer measures of success. Yet our experiences show us again and again that nothing external can completely fulfill our deep longing for meaning and purpose. We get caught up in the action of doing rather than the state of being, and this leaves us with thoughts and emotions constantly dancing in our awareness and dictating our actions. Yet, in a state of a quiet mind we can touch a deep inner joy and understanding that is sheer bliss. This is a state sought after by artists, musicians, writers, runners, inventors, and anyone seeking to tap into that magical creative state where truly remarkable things happen. Yoga is offered in classes or individual instruction and has many health benefits of increasing energy and concentration while decreasing stress, anxiety and worry. - Sound Therapy Long before known history and the written word, music was a part of life. Music and healing have been inseparable in the practices of ancient healing for millenia. Ancient and current cultures have used music and sound for many purposes, including celebration, worship, healing ceremonies, to induce higher spiritual states, and to enrich the quality of our lives. Modern studies (and ancient knowledge) have shown that using frequencies and harmonizing vibrations can significantly affect the harmony of our bodies. There is extensive evidence that demonstrates listening to music and playing music changes the organizational pattern and function of the brain, and can strengthen the interconnections across the hemispheres of the brain. However, the heart generates the body's most powerful electromagnetic field, 60 times greater than the brain. There are extensive neural connections linking the heart with the brain and with every cell in the body. The heart generates such a strong electromagnetic field that it can be detected several feet away from the body with current technology. There is significant research documenting how music affects the entrainment of the heart rhythms with the brain rhythms. We can all feel when we are in perfect sync or when we are out of sync. Pay attention to your surroundings and daily activities and you will find that you are surrounded by music (vibration, sound) everywhere, whether you are on hold on a phone, watching a movie, shopping for groceries, listening to a commercial, walking in nature, listening to the song bird or the wind sing, driving in your car and happily singing along with a favorite tune or finding yourself more agitated surrounded by the thrum of traffic and wailing of sirens, feeling peaceful at the sea as you hear the rhythm of the waves, or when you are surrounded by family and friends with the laughter and chatter of human voices everywhere. Sound can create tension and stress, excitement, fear, or a feeling of joy and peacefulness. Sound therapy for wellness, to aid in healing dis-ease states, or for meditation and relaxation is available in many forms, including cds, sound therapist treatments, classes, sound concerts, singing bowls, live music, or in combination with other complementary therapies. Most people find that music is an integral part of their lives and can be healing in many ways. Is it no wonder that we have music at every important event in our lives, including weddings, graduations, celebrations, funerals, award ceremonies. To help us laugh, celebrate, grieve, hope, cry, and live life to the fullest. - Nutritional Education \"You are what you eat\" is closer to the truth than we believe. Large studies at Universities around the world show that wellness and disease states are closely linked to nutrition and foods, what we do and do not get in our diets. The jury is out, and all evidence as well as common sense shows that people who have diets filled with foods that have been around for hundreds of years, and look and taste like real food, is good for us. People who eat vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, lean proteins, and a diet filled with plants live longer, have a higher quality of life, and have a much lower incidence of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases and general illness. The closer a food is to the original form (minimally processed), the more beneficial it is to us. Many studies demonstrates that processed foods, artificial additives, chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, and fast foods not only cause weight gain but are linked to heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, depression, and cancers. Basic nutritional guidelines are simple and can affect your health, energy, sleep patterns, weight, and overall quality of life. Some simple guidelines of eat fresh, avoid herbicides, pesticides and chemicals, eat lots of color and avoid white foods, prepare foods yourself, eat foods close to their original form, minimize foods out of bags, boxes, or cans, eat lean proteins that are wild or grass fed, know the source of where your food comes from, and do not eat too much. There are certified dieticians, nutritional consultants, and an endless array of books on nutrition as resources to learn about a healthy diet. Inquire about a class or workshop on nutrition, not just to treat a disease but to maintain your overall health and wellness. "}
