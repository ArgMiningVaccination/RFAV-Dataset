People with allergies have irregular and hyperactive reactions in their immune systems to mold, pollen, food, insect stings, normally innocent substances in the air, and many other materials (all known as allergens). Exposure to an allergen occurs when people swallow it, inhale it, or absorb it under their skin. There are many types of allergies including, hay fever, pet allergies and drug allergies. Common allergic reaction symptoms include: - Sneezing and an itchy runny nose - Irritated, watery eyes - Exhaustion - Rashes and Hives - Cramps, Vomiting, & Diarrhea (for food allergens) - Pain and Swelling (for insect stings) - Cough and post-nasal drip Levels of reaction to an allergen vary person to person, and can range from low to high. Severe allergic reactions cause entire-body reactions (anaphylaxis), which are life threatening and must be treated immediately. Asthmatic attacks are also highly triggered by allergic reactions. To determine if you have allergies you can take allergy tests, such as skin (gold standard) and blood tests. Approximately 10% of patients have a reported allergy to penicillin. But studies have shown that the vast majority of these patients have been misdiagnosed.
