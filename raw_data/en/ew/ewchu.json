Variants and Vaccines Bill Kelly History of Variants Name Date of Emergence Origen Genotype Wild Type October 2019 China Alpha September 2020 UK B.1.1.7 Beta May 2020 South Africa B.1.351 Gamma November 2020 Brazil P .1 Delta October 2020 India B.1.617.2 Lambda June 2021 Peru C.37 Mu June 2021 Columbia B1.621 Iota November 2020 New York B.1.526Variants A Few Specifics Alpha - Binds more tightly to ACE2 binding receptor (N501Y) 50% more contagious than wild type May have been driven by convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies Beta - Has N501Y (increased transmission) Also has E484K (decreased neutralization by antibody) Gamma - Increased transmission (N501Y) Resists proteolytic cleavage (D614G) of spike proteinVariants Delta - Now dominant variant in most of the world Markely increased transmission -(similar to chicken pox) Produces higher viral loads than previous variants Produces longer duration of shedding Evades immune response to previous (non -delta) infections Less sensitive to neutralizing antibodies Lower vaccine efficacyThe coming of Delta -Vaccines Single dose BioNTech /Pfizer vaccine (PHE June 2021) 33% protection against symptomatic disease (Alpha > 50%) 75% protection against hospitalization Fully vaccinated (2 weeks after second dose) 80% protection against infection 88% protection against symptomatic disease (Alpha 93%) 94% protection against hospitalization https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586 -021-03777 -9Variant sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies Sera from individuals having received one dose of Pfizer vaccine barely inhibited variants Delta and Beta Two doses generated a neutralizing response in 95% of individuals, with titers 3 -5 fold lower against Delta than Alpha Delta spread is associated with an escape to antibodies targeting non - RBD and RBD SpikeVariants Lambda - More transmissible than alpha or gamma, but not as transmissible as delta More resistant to vaccines than alpha or gamma More resistant to neutralizing antibodies Mu- More resistant to vaccines and natural immunity Less transmissible than delta Delta plus (B.1.617.2AY1/2) Spreads more easily; binds better to lung tissue May not be more deadly than delta AY1 or 2 adds to immune escape May be a serious problem for monoclonal antibodies May become the first \"Variant of High Consequence\" Variants So What?? Variants can arise spontaneously or in response to selective pressure Variants can lead to increased spread or virulence We could be 1 -2 mutations from making current vaccines ineffective Increasing vaccine coverage is crucial to prevent worse mutationsCOVID -19 Vaccines (Real and Potential) Killed Virus Vaccines Live Virus Vaccines Split Virus Vaccines DNA Vaccines Adenovirus Vector Vaccines mRNA VaccinesAdenovirus Vector Vaccine Splice DNA protein into adenovirus Adenovirus infects vaccine recipient Spike protein produced along with viral replication Spike protein interacts with host immune system Anti-spike protein antibodies are produced. Adenovirus Vector Vaccine mRNA Vaccine mRNA packaged to prevent degradation Packaged mRNA injected into recipient mRNA is transcribed by tRNA to make spike protein Spike protein interacts with immune system Anti-spike antibodies are producedVaccine Efficacy Is Moderna better than BioNTech /Pfizer Herd Immunity May not be achievable by vaccination alone Decreasing vaccine efficacy increases the vaccine coverage required Complicated by asymptomatic infections Based on interaction of Ro, vaccine coverage, vaccine efficacy, and natural immunity in populationHerd Immunity Breakthrough Infections Unavoidable if vaccine is less than 100% effective Becomes more common as vaccine coverage increases Depends on interaction of vaccine uptake, vaccine efficacy and (possibly) Ro Despite breakthroughs, there is still a 25 -fold higher rate of hospitalization and death among unvaccinatedAntibody dependent enhancement ADE Boosters We have no idea about the proper dosing regime Antibody titers decrease after 6 -8 months 3rdvaccination significantly increases antibody titers We don't know the significance of antibody titers. 3rddoses decrease the odds of testing positive for COVID -19 for at least 3 weeks. There are few data "}
