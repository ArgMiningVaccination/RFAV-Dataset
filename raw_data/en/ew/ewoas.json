There's no magic pill to cure ailments. I don't belittle medicines that I don't have the knowledge of, and I am always interested in patients who find relief from an alternative branch of medicine. One of the reasons being, I attempt to understand how a particular medication has helped. However, the one thing that I'm skeptical about, and which I dissuade my patients from following, is metal therapy. I have seen people suffering from kidney failures, and a few even expiring, so that's one 'therapy' that I wouldn't advise anyone to follow. There is a medication called Sarpagandha (Rauvolfia serpentia, or the Indian snakeroot). It is a species of a flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae, and the extracts of this plant has a compound called reserpine, which is used in anti-hypertensive medications. It is said that Mahatma Gandhi used reserpine as a tranquiliser. I have in the past used this compound to treat patients (it has now been replaced by better medications). The point I'm trying to make is, such compounds cannot be simply called herbal medication. Rather, they should be termed 'integrative medicine', the interface between herbs and allopathy. Simply put, herbal medicines are compounds extracted from herbs. They have been in existence since ancient times. It is worth noting that 25% of the medical molecules available in the US have their origins in herbs, and at least 7,000 medical compounds have their origins in plants. Modern molecules such as quinine, aspirin and digitalis -- the latter is derived from foxgloves and used to treat heart failure -- come from herbal parenthood. The extracts of several herbs are put into capsules and claimed that the tablets will act on the body the same way as the natural substance. This may not be true. Among the herbs available in tablet form, and prescribed fairly often, is the St John's-wort, which is hypericum perforatum, a flowering plant in the family Hypericaceae, a medicinal herb with antidepressant activity, and potent anti-inflammatory properties. Till a few years ago, the general perception was that the medication being herbal, it was wellsuited to treat such conditions in pregnant women, where pharmacological molecules may be contraindicated because of their effects on the foetus. This, however, does not appear to be correct. There have been several concerns about using St John's-wort, and it appears that it does interfere with some of the allopathic medications. Another interesting herb which I have come across is Ma huang, which is known in English as ephedra. It is a medicinal preparation from the plant Ephedra sinica, and is widely used by athletes as a performance-enhancing drug, and also for weight loss. In recent years, ephedra-containing supplements have been found to be unsafe, following which the US Food and Drug Administration banned it. Then there is the hugely popular Malabar tamarind, or Garcinia Cambogia, a weight loss supplement that people from across the country vouch for. It is also said to stabilise blood sugar and cholesterol levels. The Journal of Obesity in 2011 reviewed it, and said that people who used it did lose about 2lbs (about 0.9 kg) more compared to those who didn't. In 2009, the FDA had cautioned the doctors against its usage because of liver problems, but it couldn't be established that the medication caused such ailments. A study in food and chemical toxicology stated that high doses of the herb can cause testicular atrophy. Anecdotal experiences do suggest it to be useful in weight loss but medical literature is sparse on the subject, and I will not comment on it. People willing to spend a lot of money on the 'miracle pill' for weight loss, but they don't want to exercise or control their diet. As a result, the search for such a pill continues. The fact that it's herbal, therefore it's safe, is far off the truth. One must remember that many medicinal molecules are derived from herbs, and when they become pharmacological, they are subject to extensive scrutiny by various organisations. Herbal medicines come under the umbrella of nutraceuticals, and there is an impression that all of them are safe for consumption, which may not be true. One must remember that the philosopher Socrates was put to death by making him drink a liquid derived from herbs.

I have seen people suffering from kidney failures, and a few even expiring, so that's one 'therapy' that I wouldn't advise anyone to follow. Several of my patients often ask me about the benefits/side-effects of herbal medicines. Let me tell you, herbal treatment is not alien to doctors practicing allopathy. I'll give you an example.
