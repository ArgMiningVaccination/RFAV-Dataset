Don't Panic! Coming from a family that believe in Chinese herbal medicine, I've been to the Chinese doctor plenty of times. They take a look at you, measure your pulse from your wrist with 2 fingers and just blank out for a few minutes. Then they list out a whole list of problems and prescribe herbs where you boil and drink (I call it Liquid Tar). My family believes in these practices as it has been practice over a long period of time but there doesn't seem to be a lot of research involved. I've asked my regular family doctor about this practice and he didn't have much to comment on it. So does Chinese Herbal Medicine work or is it just a Placebo effect? P.S. I drink the stuff but I don't know if I get better because of it or it's just my body recovering naturally. "}
