You are expected to wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth during your entire visit. KN95, N95, KF94 are recommended. Surgical masks are provided at the entry of the office free of charge. I also consistently wear a mask as the provider in and out of treatment settings. - Unfortunately, you cannot come in if you have a cold unless you have a negative PCR from the last 48 hrs. Rapid antigen tests are currently not accurate at detecting new strains of COVID-19. Those who are not exhibiting any symptoms such as fever, sinus cold, sore throat or cough, and have not been exposed to covid-19 you may come in-person as long as you can wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth for the duration of your visit. - Before the start of each day bathroom keys, door knobs, light switches, hand sanitizer dispenser and other frequently touched surfaces are fully disinfected with medical grade cleaner. Between patients and uses, these surfaces are cleaned with an alcohol-based cleaner. Air filters are being run throughout the day. Linens are no longer being used on treatment tables and all pillows are covered with vinyl protective covers and wiped down between usage. Face cradles are covered by a fleece cover and a disposable cover -both are changed after each use. I have recently been using a CO2 monitor to assess ventilation and airflow in the treatment rooms. Readings range from 600-900 which is considered low-moderate. - Facials are available. Please note there is a 48 hr cancellation policy on facials. Facial/unmasked treatments are not recommended for those unvaccinated or immunocompromised. I understand that every situation is different so feel free to discuss this with me. For those who have booked a facial you are expected to enter and leave the space masked. You will be told when to remove the mask for your treatment. COVID Response - Acupuncture is one of the four pillars of Chinese Medicine. It is the insertion of very fine needles through your skin at strategic points on the body in order to balance or restore the flow of Qi, energy and/or circulation to a particular area or along an acupuncture channel or meridian. Classically performed with moxibustion. - Common conditions acupuncture can help with: lower back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, any chronic or acute pains and injuries, arthritis, sinus congestion, auto immune disorders, depression, anxiety, stress management, headaches or migraines, menstrual disorders, fertility challenges, endometriosis, dental pain, dry eyes, allergies, cold and flu prevention, insomnia, fatigue, circulation issues, post stroke, acid reflux, bloating, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, spinal fusion, asthma and the list can go on. If you would like to talk about it more, please feel free to contact me directly! - Absolutely! As long as you are well enough to travel to my clinic while pregnant, acupuncture would be great for you. You can always check with your OB/GYN if you're not sure. Acupuncture is a great treatment option during pregnancy because it is all natural and safe. It is recommended to have regular treatments during your pregnancy in order to help with morning sickness, improve digestion, sinus congestion or colds, allergies, headaches, general stress relief, aches and pains and other issues that may arise during pregnancy. Read more about acupuncture during pregnancy [on my blog.](https://www.emilygraceacupuncture.com/blog/acupuncture-during-pregnancy) Please be sure to inform me of any medical conditions you might have. - Yes, in fact, it is recommended to have regular acupuncture visits to enhance fertility, balance menstrual cycles and assist IVF, IUI. For those with fertility challenges it is recommended to commit to coming in for treatments 1-3x's a week. Herbal formulas are highly recommended for those who are not doing IVF or IUI. - You will feel a tiny pinch or prick at first and then the insertion of the needle. Some normal sensations you may experience: muscle twitch, electrical sensation down a limb, heavy achy feeling, throbbing, static, warmth or itchiness. It is common to feel more sensitive in some places more than others. Some of these sensations may change, persist or go away. If it feels uncomfortable to you, just let me know and we can adjust or figure out a way to work around it. You want to rest comfortably once you are in treatment. For some people it may hurt at first but you will learn more about how your body reads different sensations as part of your experience. Please remember that feeling sensations is not only an important part of healing your body but it is normal. - Chinese Medicine is a system of medicine that has been in practice consistently for arguably over 5000 years (longer than modern allopathic medicine). There are four pillars of Chinese Medicine: 1- Acupuncture and Moxibustion 2- Diet, Nutrition and Chinese Herbal Therapy. 3- Tui na which includes massage and physical manipulation. 4- Qi Gong which can be physical practices, postures or exercises as well as meditation techniques. - Moxibustion is a heat therapy often used alongside acupuncture. It is the burning of prepared mugwort or Ai Ye along acupuncture points, channels or areas of the body for a warming effect or to improve circulation. Learn more about it here Acupuncture - For your first acupuncture treatment, please allow for 90 min as we will spend a bit of time talking about your chief complaint, health history and treatment goals. Afterwards we will discuss a treatment plan going forward and you will receive your first acupuncture treatment. The amount of time you will rest with acupuncture is anywhere between 30-45 min. During this time you will be left to lay comfortably to rest. I will come check on you periodically to insure you are still comfortable. Many people fall asleep or get very relaxed. You might receive acupuncture on your hands, feet, ears or head as well as in the areas you are feeling pain. You can bring comfortable clothes to rest in if you like. I also have towels available for you to use. Please make sure you've eaten before your appointment so that you don't arrive on an empty stomach. This will help to prevent any possibility of lightheadedness or dizziness afterwards. After acupuncture, please plan to take it easy. Avoid any strenuous activity, working out and/or drinking alcohol until the next day. You will want to stay well hydrated afterwards. The same aftercare applies to cupping as well. After cupping you should additionally avoid shower/bath for the next 12-24 hrs. More on acupuncture aftercare here. - When you make your Initial Acupuncture Consultation, we will have time discuss your condition fully and together decide the best options for you. Other modalities with acupuncture can include: moxibustion, cupping, gua sha and electro acupuncture. - As an acupuncturist, I always encourage patients to receive acupuncture because it is a trusted, safe, natural and well rounded modality. If you are not ready or unsure I offer LED treatments for acne and pain conditions, cupping as a standalone therapy (though you should be screened for contraindications), herbal consultations and ear seed applications. If your condition or treatment goals require a full intake on your health history, acupuncture treatments will be your best option. - I currently do not have online booking--I want to keep my business as human as possible for as long as I can. To make an appointment just text (845-428-9168) or email me. Please include your first and last name, phone # and email address and let me know the days/times that work best for you. You can also give me a call but you may have to wait for me to call back if I am not able to answer the call. When and if I implement online booking it will mean that I will be strict on cancellations, lateness, no-shows and appointment time changes. - Please don't do that! My online electronic health records system is protected with security measures. You are asked to make a password so that your information is secure. I do not have paper files because it would require me to keep a locked cabinet in the office that would grow with each patient file and eventually take up more and more space. Space is hard to come by in NYC. I am required to obtain consent and keep records of visits by law. I cannot treat you without the completion of the forms. This is just how my practice is set up. - I accept HSA and FSA cards, but I do not accept insurance. I have tried the insurance billing route to better serve my patients, but it was not sustainable. I do not believe in enabling establishments (insurance companies), who do not know or understand acupuncture, to dictate this much of the acupuncture industry. This is a traditional and indigenous form of medicine, and should be in the hands of the people who have taken the time to respect and learn it. It is important to keep the gifts of this medicine in the right hands -- which is not insurance companies. I do not want to participate in a system that actively works against patient care for monetary gains. Additionally, the way insurance companies (and pharma) control how Western Medicine is practiced, is one of the major reasons why people have begun to mistrust it. Please understand that Chinese Medicine is meant to be individualized medicine that is patient-centered and I intend to keep it that way. Any dollars you invest into your health with Emily Grace Acupuncture goes directly to the business, acupuncture suppliers and herbal pharmacies. We are all small businesses who care about the health of our communities. There are no random or unnecessary costs here! More often than not, insurance creates a barrier between healthcare providers and patients for the purpose of money and capitalism. - The course of treatment will vary from person to person. You should consider how long you have had your current condition and the severity of it to get an estimate of how many treatments you will need. I take into consideration not only your condition but also your lifestyle and unique constitution. Most patients begin with 5-10 sessions. Many patients come weekly or monthly for general wellness and prevention. If you are seeking treatment for fertility or menstrual cycle balancing you should expect weekly visits for a minimum of 3 months. Medicine is meant to treat you over time with a course of treatment. We can discuss together the most appropriate treatment plan for you. Frequency and consistency can help you resolve your concerns in a more timely manner. Similar to going to the gym, you cannot expect results from just one work out. - Part of affording treatment is making the investment and commitment to yourself to get better. I charge the average rate in my area for the cost of private, 1-on-1 acupuncture and I offer many, many free add-ons to my patients because my practice is focused on making sure patients are able to get better. Weekly visits are often needed in order to improve your condition. Twice weekly visits will assist a long-term condition along more efficiently or help an acute condition heal quicker. If you are experiencing financial hardships, I offer package agreements in which you will receive some discount for purchasing multiple sessions at once with the agreement to complete the package. Please purchase your package [here](https://emily-grace-acupuncture.square.site). I also offer 30 min Auricular Acupuncture for only $45 (this allows you to easily receive 2 treatments a week for just $90!) See full pricing list [HERE.](https://emily-grace-acupuncture.square.site)You can also become a [blog reader](https://www.emilygraceacupuncture.com/blog)! I offer discount codes in many of my [blog](https://www.emilygraceacupuncture.com/blog)posts. Another option is that you can see me and my team of acupuncture student interns at the Pacific College school clinic. $60/$55 per visit [Learn more about that here.](https://www.emilygraceacupuncture.com/pacific-college-clinic-hours) Kindly see that I have intentionally created treatment options where cost can be more accessible to those who have challenges with income and/or finances. It is important for you as an individual to value your health and value the time it takes to heal. With that said, I hope to foster a conscious and kind community. Respecting lateness and cancellation policies is what helps to keep my costs continually affordable and open to all. Courtesy is priceless. First-Time Session Questions - Packages are good for 1 year. There are no refunds on package agreements. I am a solo-prenuer running a heart-centered business. The cost of running any business is high in NYC. I do want to be reasonable and I am hoping and expecting the same from you all. My business is set up to be as accessible as possible but these are the type of things that add more to the time/cost of running my business. With that said I am willing to honor unused sessions as long as you are able to show a receipt for your purchase as I no longer keep track of packages after 1 year. Acupuncture treatment package agreements are created for those who are experiencing financial hardships. The agreement is to pre-pay for sessions at a discount in consideration for your financial situation. If you break the agreement you cannot get a full refund. I know life can be unexpected, so therefore, only under extreme and extenuating circumstances I will consider this but please understand that your refund will be pro-rated by the amount of sessions used at the regular single session price ($150/120). This means if you've used 4 sessions of a 5 pack you will not have any left for a refund. If you you've used 8 sessions of a 10 pack you will not have any left for a refund. Please be mindful of others and know that because I do not have administrative staff, that such situations are often what motivates price increases. Any refund will also cost an additional 5% due to processing fees. - Yes, you can purchase your sessions [HERE](https://emily-grace-acupuncture.square.site). Please contact me to make an appointment! If your purchase is for a friend please kindly send me an email to let me know. Facial appointments require a screening call and cannot be purchased online. - As a courtesy please try to give 48 hours or more notice when changing your appointment time. The cancellation policy is strictly 24 hrs. You will be charged for the full amount of your appointment if you late cancel or no-show. Please understand that I strongly dislike charging for this, however I am a solo-preneur running a heart-centered business. An important aspect of what I want patients to learn and understand as part of their healing is that you are a part of something bigger. When you take a time slot up and do not give notice, you are taking away potential healing time and energy from others. I hold space for you and we should be mindful of each other's time. You can easily cancel 24hrs ahead by sending a text, email or give a call/leave a message. We want to consciously consider how we take up space, energy and resources in life. I understand that real life emergencies happen and I want to hold space for you in those cases too. As a courtesy from me, if you can reschedule your appointment within the same day there is no cancellation charge -however this is not guaranteed that there are appointment times available and we all have to be reasonable. As far as lateness, please arrive as soon as you can and I will always try my best to accommodate you as a courtesy but it is not guaranteed that I will be able to. Appointments will end on time regardless of your arrival time. Add-ons (cupping, gua sha, LED) will not be available when you are late. Please be aware that being more than 5 min late compromises my ability to treat others to the best of my ability and in a timely manner. Lateness, late cancels and no shows ultimately impact other patients, my energy and the costs of running my business and the cost of treatment to everyone. Package, Cancellation and Late Policies - To become an acupuncturist, it is required to have 3000 hours of training and to be licensed in the state you practice in. This also requires national board exams and for some states an additional exam. In my 5 years of formal study, I obtained a Bachelors, Masters and clinical Doctorate in Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine from Pacific College of Health Sciences. My training included a comprehensive study of Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine as well as many hours of hands on clinical experience. You can learn more about my educational background in my bio. I have passed and completed all four of the national board exams and am licensed in both NY and NJ. - NO. Dry needling is a form of cultural appropriation and is harmful to the field of acupuncture. When I consider the 4 years of needle technique training I've received in acupuncture school, I consider dry needling to be unsafe. Dry needling is when someone other than a licensed acupuncturist performs acupuncture in which the needle is manipulated in trigger points without Chinese Medical training or knowledge but attempts to emulate acupuncture needle techniques without consideration for the patient's constitution or other health factors. As a licensed acupuncturist I perform various needle and hand techniques from Chinese Medicine only depending on the patient's condition and needs. Chinese Medicine allows for in-depth background knowledge that dry needling does not consider. Dry needling is not permitted in New York State. Emily Grace Acupuncture does not support culturally insensitive behaviors or actions. I acknowledge that cultural appropriation is not only disrespectful, it is a microagression that reinforces the commodification of oppressed populations. Training for a licensed acupuncturist is more than 3000 hours and much more comprehensive than the abbreviated knowledge given in a dry needling weekend seminar. I apply the Classical 36 Needle techniques as well as trigger point technique which is often what dry needling tries to emulate. I only use needle and hand techniques when they are appropriate to the patient. - My #1 priority is treating my patients in the clinic. Collaborations always sound like a great idea but my business and brand is extremely personal. I only consider working with brands and people who align with my mission and values. If you're interested please fill out a collaboration form [here](/contact). - Please sign up for my mailing list here. About Emily Grace Acupuncture - I take follow up acupuncture appointments 1-2 Saturdays per month. Please book ahead and be mindful of changing appointments as these appointment slots are limited and are often taken by those who don't have traditional work schedules. I do not take new patient appointments, facials or vaginal steams on Saturdays. - I am located at 122 Baxter Street in Chinatown/Little Italy. Find me at room 501. You do not need to be buzzed into the building. Use 118 Baxter Street entrance before 5pm if you need to avoid the steps at the front of the building. Do not use the stairwell here. - I am not able to accommodate traveling for house calls at this time. Clinic Information - I hold a monthly Facial Rejuvenation Workshop for women, trans, non binary people + allies in which I teach participants how to use jade rollers, facial gua sha and cupping tools. These techniques are a great way to add value to your current skincare routines and products. A facial tool kit is included in the cost of the class. If you would like to purchase the tools without attending the class please feel free to purchase [HERE](https://emily-grace-acupuncture.square.site)or reach out via email. Please note that I do not ship my items so you can pick up at your next acupuncture visit or arrange for a time to pick up from me directly. If you are not a woman and want to learn, please consider [setting up a private workshop](/contact)among a small group of your friends with me! - I use EVER skincare products in my facial rejuvenation workshops. I have had such a good experience using this line for the past 5 years. I do however strongly encourage those who have have a skincare routine that is working for them, or are easily affected by experimenting with other products to bring their own products to the class. Some of the products are available for purchase in the workshop or feel free to purchase online if you enjoyed them: [EVER SKINCARE](https://www.stelladot.com/pages/ever?s=emilygrace) - There are so many, "}
