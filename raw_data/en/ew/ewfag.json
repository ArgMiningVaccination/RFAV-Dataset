It believes that everything in the universe consists of the Five Great Elements (Panch Mahabhutas) -Space (Akasha), Air (Vayu), Fire (Agni), Water (Jal) and Earth (Prithvi). Ayurveda works on the principles of these five basic elements. It explains the importance of balancing these elements for a healthy body and mind.
