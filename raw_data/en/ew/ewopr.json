The Arnold Lab uses systems engineering approaches to understand variability in the immune response to infection, vaccination, and injury. Computational approaches developed in our laboratory give new insight into mechanism and provide better classification of disease states. Current projects in the lab focus on: 1) Gaining insights into how personalized differences in antibody features influence the immune response after vaccination; 2) Understanding how variability in the composition of the vaginal microbiome impacts disease susceptibility and therapeutic efficacy in women; and 3) Identifying immune signatures associated with exacerbation and progression of chronic lung diseases.
