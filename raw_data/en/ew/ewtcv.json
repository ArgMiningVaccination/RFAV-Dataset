An exception to this is the Wednesday, October 12 clinic at the TAMU Health Clinical Building. Yes. It is possible to have flu, as well as other respiratory illnesses, and COVID-19 at the same time. Health experts are still studying how common this can be. Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Yes, you can get a flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine/booster at the same time. Even though both vaccines can be given at the same visit, people should follow the recommended schedule for either vaccine: If you haven't gotten your currently recommended doses of COVID-19 vaccine, get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can, and ideally get a flu vaccine by the end of October. *Information from [cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/) [Key Facts about Seasonal Flu Vaccine (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm) [Frequently Asked Influenza (Flu) Questions: 2022-2023 "}
