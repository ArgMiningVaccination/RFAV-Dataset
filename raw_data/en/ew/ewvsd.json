Men and women, some of whom have come from far-flung areas of Delhi, grab a seat on wooden benches lined up in the Capital's famous [Ghugghi Pahelwan](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ghugghi-pahelwan) lane and prepare for a long wait. Some have a bad knee, some stiff shoulders, a few have fractures but they've all put their faith in bonesetters who heal, desi style. Ghugghi Pahelwan, who migrated from Lahore after Partition and set up shop in 1954, has become almost an urban legend in these parts. And though he's dead, the brand has flourished. His sons and relatives now run the small clinic. Plastered with photographs of wrestlers and gods, it is the last port of call for many whose ailments either require expensive treatment or have been deemed incurable. When a patient's turn comes, usually after a three-hour wait, the hadvaid (bonesetter) hurriedly slaps a white paste on the affected area followed by equally speedy rubbing of a dark oily substance. A tight bandage follows. The entire process lasts barely a minute or two and costs a mere Rs 10-70 per visit. It's usually three to four visits before a person is healed - many swear they have been. But cure or not, there's a steady stream of patients from eight in the morning to seven in the evening. The pahelwans, who go by the surname Malhotra, are secretive about their trade. They are unwilling to reveal the ingredients of the lep (salve) and oil that the signboard outside claims treats polio, paralysis, cervical pain and 'psytica' (sciatica ). \"I learnt the art from my father. The medicine we apply is made from herbs. We don't use chemicals,\" says the pahelwan's son, Satish Malhotra. Bonesetting is an ancient technique. In his book, Bonesetting, Chiropractic, and Cultism, Samuel Homola says the practice dates back to ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt. In India, too, the art is old. The ancient medical text, Sushruta Samhita, explains bonesetting in detail. And Delhi, where the 21st century can be a metro ride away from the 16th, is teeming with bonesetters - from dusty Mahipalpur in the city's southern outskirts to shabby Turkman Gate in Old Delhi to busy Shakarpur in east Delhi. The last is where the hennaed Ustaad Bhajan Lal sits with signboards painted with bandaged Hulk Hogan look-alikes . In an age of laser surgery, there is a romance about these bonesetters who work with nothing more than their bare hands and the wisdom of experience . Fractures, sprains, strains, dislocated shoulders - they claim to fix them all. Some even offer solutions for \"boneless\" parts of the male anatomy. Choudhary Mohammed Ikram Pahelwan , who runs a small roadside clinic in Mahipalpur's Mata Chowk, claims to treat fractures, epilepsy and premature ejaculation. Two bottles of Jack Daniels half filled with a dark oil adorn his 6x10-foot clinic. He is rather reticent about his sexual treatments but is forthcoming on bonesetting. \"My grandfather and my uncle were masters of the art and treated people for free. Once I sprained my foot after jumping from a tree and my uncle healed me in minutes,\" he says. In north India, the art of bonesetting is almost synonymous with wrestlers. Many bonesetters use the word pahelwan as a surname. Wrestlers, says Ikram, often suffer dislocations and sprains, and while watching fellow wrestlers being treated, some develop a rudimentary understanding of bones. \"One wrestler was such an expert that he would dislocate his opponent's elbow in the ring, flatten him and fix the elbow again,\" he says. Metatarsal, tibia, metacarpals, scaphoid - Ikram says he can identify most bones. \"Yesterday,\" he says, \"I fixed a young Bihari's dislocated shoulder.\" On a poster showing the human anatomy , he places his index finger on the clavicle. \"The collar bone was dislocated so I used a towel to pull the shoulder above. Then I gently turned the elbow around,\" he says. \"He was okay in minutes . The hospitals wanted Rs 10,000 for an operation. I charged Rs 450.\" But does bonesetting really work? Orthopaedician P K Dave admits that some bonesetters do have a degree of working knowledge. He adds that many of them are quacks whose faulty treatment can harm a patient. \"Repairing a fracture isn't just about fixing a bone. What about the torn tissue? Faulty treatment can hamper blood circulation or worse,\" says Dave, former director of AIIMS. But interior decorator Nirupama Chanana is a convert. Initially, she was wary of taking her 75-year-old grandmother who suffered multiple hip fractures to Ghugghi Pahelwan. \"As she is old, the doctors ruled out surgery, so we had no option but to turn to a traditional bonesetter. After two-three visits, she got relief from pain. After about 10 visits , she was able to crawl. Now, she can move with a walker. For us, the recovery is almost a miracle,\" she says. Nonetheless, stories abound about how ill-trained bonesetters end up harming patients. With no quality control, there are possibly five quacks for every genuine practitioner. Perhaps the existence of bonesetters is an indicator that even after 62 years of Independence , modern medicine remains too expensive and that government healthcare still doesn't reach millions. In such a scenario, it is easy to sell a shartiya ilaaj (guaranteed treatment). "}
