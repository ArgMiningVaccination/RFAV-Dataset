We reviewed clinical trials reported dose-\u0000nding results to estimate the dose-response relationship of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) of COVID-19 vaccines. We further predict the vaccine e\u0000cacy against both ancestral and variants, using previously reported correlates of protection and cross-reactivity. We also reviewed and compared T-cell responses and safety pro\u0000les between fractional and standard dose groups. We found that dose fractionation of mRNA and protein subunit vaccines could induce SARS-CoV-2 speci\u0000c nAbs and T-cells that likely confer a reasonable level of protection (i.e., vaccine e\u0000cacy>50%) against ancestral strains and variants. Safety pro\u0000les of fractional doses were non-inferior to the standard dose. Dose fractionation of mRNA and protein subunit vaccines may be safe and effective. Introduction Three years into the pandemic, COVID-19 continues to threaten the global health with emerging variants. While vaccinations have averted tens of thousands of hospitalizations and deaths in high-income countries 1,2, only 14.5% of people in lower income countries received at least one dose as of 1 April 2022 3. Dose fractionation of vaccines has been previously recommended to ease global supply shortage and accelerate vaccine coverage in low-income countries, where a larger proportion of the population could have access to vaccination despite for each individual would receive a lower vaccine dose 4,5. In 2016, fractional doses of yellow fever vaccines were non-inferior to the standard dose in immunogenicity and safety 6 and recommended for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO) 5. However, uncertainties and concerns about the vaccine e\u0000cacy using fractional doses against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strains and emerging variants of concern (VoCs) 7-9, and the potential differences between vaccine platforms, hindered the endorsement for dose fractionation of COVID-19 vaccines 10,11. Modelling studies suggested that dose fractionation of COVID-19 vaccines may be cost-effective in low- income countries, while such \u0000ndings were largely determined by vaccine e\u0000cacy. However, as few clinical trials of dose fractionation of COVID-19 vaccines were available (possibly lack of commercial incentives 12), those modelling studies either assumed a range of hypothetic vaccine e\u0000cacy or used data against the ancestral strains 12,13. Additionally, VoCs evaded vaccine-induced immunity and resulted in lower vaccine e\u0000cacy against symptomatic infections 7-9, adding more complexity to assessing the e\u0000cacy of fractioning CVODI-19 vaccine doses. Therefore, reliable estimations of vaccine e\u0000cacy against both ancestral and VoCs of fractional doses is critical to determine the cost-effectiveness. Studies so far suggest vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) may be a good correlate of protection (CoP) against infection outcomes for ancestral strain and VoCs 14,15. Therefore, characterizing the dose-response relationship between vaccine-induced nAbs may allow predictionPage 3/19of e\u0000cacy of fractional doses. In addition, evidence suggested that T-cell mediated immunity, especially CD4+cells, may contribute to better disease outcomes 16,17, indicating that comparing the T-cells responses elicited by fractional doses to that from standard doses may further inform the potential vaccine e\u0000cacy against severe infections conferred by fractional doses. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of phase I/II trials that reported dose-\u0000nding results of immunogenicity and safety pro\u0000les for COVID-19 vaccines (detailed search terms in Table S1). We estimated the pooled dose-response relationship of nAbs against the ancestral strains, which were then used to predict the potential VE of fractional doses against infections of both ancestral strains and VoCs. We also reviewed the differences in seroconversion of nAbs, T-cell mediated immune responses and safety pro\u0000le between fractional and standard dose (i.e., doses used for \u0000nal products or phase III trials) groups, to further assess the differences in immunogenicity and safety after receiving fractional and standard doses. Results We systematically reviewed 38 studies (out of 1,733 searched; Supplementary Fig. 1) 18-55, among which inactivated vaccines (29%, n=11) were studied n=5) (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2). We found overall low risks of bias of the included studies, expect that seven adopted the non-randomized, and non-double-blinded design (Supplementary Fig. 2) 18,28,29,34,39,41,55. We estimated the pooled risk ratio (RR) of the seroconversion (pre-de\u0000ned by each study; details in Supplementary Table 3) against ancestral strains among individuals who completed fractional and standard dose from 14 studies of 9 vaccines (Fig. 1). The probability of seroconversion to ancestral strains was 2.1% (95% con\u0000dence interval (CI) 0.4-3.6%; I2= 52.0%, P-value<0.01) lower among individuals with fractional doses compared to standard doses. However, we found no association between dose fractionation (1.4%, 95% CI, -20.4-29.3% per fold increase in dose) and seroconversion proportions between lower and standard dose groups after accounting for vaccine platform, age group and assay methods (i.e., live or pseudo virus) (Supplementary Table 4). To quantify the dose-response relationship of nAbs and dose fractionation, we \u0000tted a generalized additive model (deviance explained 79%; Supplementary Fig. 3 and Table 5) to vaccine-induced nAbs levels against ancestral strains and accounted for the vaccine platform, vaccination schedule (i.e., total dosages and time since complete vaccinations), age group and assay methods. Post-vaccine nAbs levels were standardized to the ratio of nAbs titers induced by vaccinations and natural infections within each study 14. We also applied the previously established CoP of nAbs 14 to predict the vaccine e\u0000cacy of fractional doses against symptomatic and severe infection of ancestral strains.Page 4/19Twenty-four studies reported nAbs against live (n=20) and/or pseudo (n=7) ancestral viruses from both post-vaccination and convalescent sera (Supplementary Figs. 4-6 and Supplementary Table 3). We estimated that two half-dose mRNA vaccines would elicit 2.6 (95% CI, 2.1 to 3.3, measured on day 14) fold of the nAbs against the ancestral strain in convalescent sera (Fig. 2A), which is expected to prevent 97% CI, 95-97%) of symptomatic and 100% (95% CI, 100-100%) of severe infections of the ancestral strains, respectively (Fig. 2B). Whereas two half-dose inactivated vaccines would elicit 0.28 (95% IC 0.20 to 0.37) -fold of nAbs against the ancestral strains in convalescent CI, 92-96%) e\u0000cacy against symptomatic and severe infections of the ancestral strains, respectively. Overall, our predictions suggested that the reduction in vaccine e\u0000cacy was smaller than dose fractionation across all vaccine platforms (Fig. 2C); half-doses may provide more than half of protection e\u0000cacy of standard doses. We also estimated that fully vaccinated with fractional doses elicited higher nAbs than partially vaccinated with standard dose across all platforms (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Figs. 3-7). Further incorporating the reported fold reduction in of vaccine-induced nAbs against VoCs (Supplementary Table 6)7,15, we projected that two half-dose mRNA vaccines would confer the highest e\u0000cacy against symptomatic infections of VoCs (94%, 95% and against Omicron), followed by subunit, vector and inactivated vaccines (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 8). Half- dose vaccine e\u0000cacy against severe infections of Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta was predicted to be over 75% for across vaccine platforms, except for inactivated (52%, 95% CI, 41-63%) and vector (62%, 47-76%) vaccines against Beta (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 9). The e\u0000cacy against severe infections by Omicron was only estimated to above 50% for two half-dose mRNA (85%, 80-88%) and subunit (69%, e\u0000cacy against symptomatic infections of VoCs for standard dose highly correlated (Pearson correlation 0.705, p-value<0.01; Supplementary Fig. 10) with empirical data (Supplementary Table 7) 56-66, while we were not able to validate predictions for fractional doses due to lack of data. Since assays and measurements used for cellular responses vary across studies, we reviewed whether T- cell mediated immune responses elicited by dose fractioning vaccines 1) would be higher than pre- vaccination level and 2) would be lower than that elicited by the standard dose vaccine. We assessed the statistical signi\u0000cance of difference in means of measurements of T-cells and related cytokines between groups within the same study (Supplementary Table 8; see Methods). All 7 studies of 5 vaccines reported signi\u0000cant increase in SARS-CoV-2 speci\u0000c CD4+/CD8+or CD4+T helper type 1 (Th1) responses after vaccinated with fractional doses compared to pre-vaccination (Fig. 4A), which were all biased to Th1 cells. Three vaccines (BNT162b132,39, MVC-COV190128 and Sf9 cells33) reported that dose fractionation elicited similar level of CD4+and/or CD8+T-cells compared to standard dose (Fig. 4B). Quarter-dose of mRNA-1273 18,29 was reported to induce signi\u0000cantly lower CD4+Th1 cells compared to standard dose, while half-dose of BBV152 were reported to induce signi\u0000cantly higher Th1 cytokines in one of two trials.Page 5/19We also compared the cellular responses between standard and higher dose groups and found no evidence for dose-dependent relationship for 7 out of 9 vaccines (Supplementary Fig. 11). We reviewed the safety pro\u0000le for 34 studies and found that, compared to standard dose group, people in the fractional dose groups tended to experience adverse events at similar or lower frequency (Supplementary Figs. 12-17). Particularly, the risk of experiencing solicited, and unsolicited adverse events were 9.5% (95% CI, 3.9-14.8%) and 24.4% (3.9-41.1%) lower in individuals who received factional dose of mRNA vaccines compared to standard doses (Supplementary Figs. 15-16). One inactivated (BBIBP-CorV in children 48) and two subunit (NVX- CoV2373 and Livzon in adults 24,40) vaccines reported higher risk of solicited systemic reactions in groups that received lower dose than the standard dose. Discussion Our \u0000ndings suggested that vaccine-induced nAbs varied substantially across dose fractions and vaccine platforms. For vaccine platforms (e.g., mRNA and subunit) which standard doses could elicit higher nAbs levels than convalescent sera, dose fractionation could induce robust nAbs against the ancestral strains and similar seroconversion proportion with standard doses. nAbs induced by fractional vaccines of mRNA and subunit were predicted to confer 65% e\u0000cacy against symptomatic and severe infections of SARS-CoV-2 variants, except for symptomatic infections of Beta and Omicron. Fractionation of vaccine doses seemed to be safe and induce robust Th1 biased T-cell responses that were similar to standard doses except for mRNA-1273. We found that dose fractionation of COVID-19 vaccines would induce, though lower than standard doses, detective nAbs against ancestral strains. Based on previously established CoP 14,15,67, these nAbs may confer reasonable protection (i.e., > 50%) against symptomatic infections of ancestral strains, but not the subsequent VoCs, especially Omicron. Previous modelling study suggested that dose fractionation could be a cost-effective strategy in low-income countries, if vaccination could confer at least 50% of protection against symptomatic infections of variants with low or moderate transmissibility (i.e., basic reproduction number R0 < 5) 13. Given these \u0000ndings, our results of nAbs and vaccine e\u0000cacy predictions suggested that dose fractionation could have been cost-effective strategy to control the emergence of some early VoCs (e.g., Alpha and Delta), but not for the currently circulating Omicron given the signi\u0000cant immunity breakthrough 7,8 and higher transmissibility 68. Despite relatively lower levels, nAbs elicited by fractional doses were predicted with high e\u0000cacy against severe infections of VoCs across vaccine platforms, even against Omicron (e.g., RNA, and subunit). Furthermore, fractional doses of most studied vaccines could induce detective and likely robust T-cell responses, which may also facilitate the vaccines' protections against severe outcomes, given that SARS- CoV-2 speci\u0000c T-cells could broadly cross-react to a range of VoCs (including Omicron) and were associated with better outcomes 16,17. Therefore, dose fractionation of COVID-19 vaccines may still avert a considerable number of hospitalizations and deaths, even with the emergence of new variants with vaccine breakthrough.Page 6/19Our results indicated that nAbs and thus the vaccine e\u0000cacy of two half-doses were higher than that by one standard dose. Given the likely robust protection of fractional doses against severe infections of both ancestral and variant strains, it therefore may avert more hospitalizations and deaths by splitting one dose into two. Shipping the standard doses and splitting at the injection sites may make dose fractionation more cost-effective by reducing logistical cost, especially cost arising from manufacture and delivery. We were not able to assess the durability of the immune responses elicited by fractional doses of COVID- 19 vaccines, as most trials reported limited follow up that was typically just one month after vaccination. Therefore, our e\u0000cacy estimates may only be indicative for short-term protection. Waning SARS-CoV-2 speci\u0000c aAbs, T-cells and vaccine e\u0000cacy (against both ancestral and VoCs) may be expected, as suggested by evidence from individuals receiving standard doses after 6 months 8,6971. For standard doses, both homogeneous and heterogenous boosters could substantially increase nAbs and vaccine e\u0000cacy against VoCs 9, while such data were lacking for fractional doses. We did not look at the nAbs induced by individual vaccine manufacturers due to limited data, while we found consistent seroconversion proportion and dose-relationship within platform (Supplementary Figs. 3-7). Nevertheless, disparities in nAbs levels and durability were reported for individual vaccines from the same platform (e.g., mRNA-1273 vs. BNT162b1 vaccines 10). To summarise, fractionation of vaccine doses, especially mRNA and protein subunit vaccines, are safe and would induce antibody and T-cell responses that likely confer a reasonable level of protection against severe infections of SARS-CoV-2 ancestral and VoCs. Using fractional doses could provide a more e\u0000cient use of limited antigen stockpiles. Methods Search strategy and study selection We searched peer-reviewed publications on clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in PubMed on 9 December 2021. We searched with the following terms: (SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19) AND (vaccine AND dose) AND (antibod* OR immun*) (Supplementary Table 1). We included dose-escalation studies that reported safety, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs, which were measured by PRNT50 and/or sVNT), and/or T- cell mediated immunity among healthy individuals received SRAS-CoV-2 vaccines (Supplementary Tables 2,3 and 8). We excluded 1) studies did not report immunological response or only reported binding antibody; 2) studies without dose-escalation; 3) studies on non-human hosts; 4) studies on participants with speci\u0000c health conditions (e.g., cancer, organ transplantation) or pregnancy; 5) studies speci\u0000cally designed for hybrid immunity (i.e., natural infection or heterogenous vaccinations); and 6) reviews or commentaries (Supplementary Fig. 1). We assessed the quality of included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2.0 for randomized trials 72 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Data extraction and processingPage 7/19Two reviewers (BY and XH) independently screened the titles and full texts of articles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. For each included study, we extracted relevant information of the vaccines and participants onto a standardized form, which includes vaccine name, manufacture, platform, dose fraction, vaccination and sampling schedule, age group, and sizes of vaccinated subjects. Dose fraction (Fi,j) was de\u0000ned as the ratio of each examined dose group (di,j) and the standard dose ( dref,j, de\u0000ned as the dose selected for the approved vaccine product or phase III trials) for each study (j): Fi,j=di,j dref,j(1) Differences in seroconversion of neutralizing antibodies after fractional and standard dose We compared the seroconversion proportion to nAbs against ancestral strains after receiving fractional doses compared with the standard dose group, where seroconversion was prede\u0000ned by each study as at least four-fold increase in nAbs and/or changing from negative to positive after vaccinations (details about de\u0000nitions for positive threshold and seroconversion were shown in Supplementary Table 3). Sample size and the number of seroconverted participants were extracted for each dose group, which were then used to estimate the pooled log risk ratio of seroconversion between fractional and standard dose group using random effects (RE) model, strati\u0000ed by vaccine type (Fig. 1). We \u0000tted mixed effects meta-regressions to assess the effects of vaccine platform and dose fractions on seroconversion, after accounting for age group and assay methods (Supplementary Table 4). We also repeated the above analysis for higher dose group, which results can be found in our data repository. Dose-response relationship of neutralizing antibodies For each study j, we extracted the mean (i,j) and standard deviations (i,j) of nAbs titers in different dose groups i; if not reported, we estimated i,j and i,jfrom 1) individual data points, or 2) median, interquartile (IQR) and sample sizes73. We then standardized the vaccine-induced (zi,j) using study: zi,j=ui,j c,j(2) We summarized standardized nAbs among different dose groups (i.e., fractional, standard, and higher dose groups) at different time points (Supplementary Fig. 2). To quantify the dose-response relationship of vaccination and the standardized nAbs (zi,j), we \u0000tted a generalized additive model (GAM; Supplementary Table 5) that accounted for the vaccine platform (V), vaccine schedule (i.e., total dosages D and days after full vaccination Ti,j), age group (A= children, adult, or elderly) and antigen used for neutralizing assay (M = live or pseudo virus):Page 8/19log2zi,j=0+TsTi,j+Fslog2Fi,j+VVj+DDi,j+AAi,j+MMi,j(3) With estimates from Eq. 3, we predicted the standardized nAbs (assuming measured by live virus and in adults; same for the following) against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain after fully vaccinated (i.e., 1 dose for vector and 2 for the rest) with fractional doses (Fi,j) for different vaccine platforms (Fig. 2A by dose fraction and Supplementary Fig. 7 by vaccine schedule). Validation of our predictions and raw data was shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. Vaccine e\u0000cacy predicted from neutralizing antibodies We applied the established CoP protection of standardized nAbs 14,15 to predict the dose-fractioning vaccine e\u0000cacy (i) against infection outcomes (E, i.e., symptomatic, or severe) of SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain for different vaccine platform (V): i,V,E=1 1+ekElog10zi,V z50,E(4) We (log10z50,E) and steepness parameter kE for both symptomatic and severe infection from the previous study 14. zi,V is the standardized nAbs at 14 days after fully vaccinated of fractional doses (Fi,j) for each vaccine platform (V), which was estimated from Eq. 3 with coe\u0000cients shown in Supplementary Table 5. We used previously reported 7,15 fold of reduction (S; Supplementary Table 6) in nAbs to estimate the level of standardized nAbs (Szi,V) against the variant S, which was then applied to Eq. 4 to predict the vaccine e\u0000cacy of dose fractioning against infections of SARS-CoV-2 variant of concerns (VoCs) (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 8-9). To validate our predicted vaccine e\u0000cacy against VoCs (Supplementary Fig. 10), we compared the predicted vaccine e\u0000cacy against symptomatic infections after standard dose and observations (Supplementary Table 7) reported previously by Pearson correlation. Standard doses were used for comparison since there were no empirical data regarding half-dose. T-cell responses Since assays and measurements used for T-cell mediated responses vary across studies, we reviewed if T-cell responses elicited by dose-fractioning vaccines 1) would be higher than that at pre-vaccination level and 2) would be lower than that elicited by the standard dose vaccine within the same study. Brie\u0000y, we extracted mean ( xi,j,k), standard error (SE, xi,j,k) and sample size (ni) of speci\u0000c measurement k for T-cell responses for each dose group or reference group (i.e., pre-vaccination or post standard dose vaccination) i in study j. Speci\u0000c measurement (k) includes T-cell types (i.e., CD4+or CD8+) and/or cytokines for T helper type 1 interferon- (IFN- ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF- ) and Interleukin-2 (IL-2)) and T helper type 2 (Th2, including IL-4, IL-5, IL-13). If mean and SE were not reported,()( )Page 9/19we estimated these metrics from individual original data points or median, IQR and sample sizes 73. We determined the statistical signi\u0000cance of difference in means (i,j,k) assuming it follows a normal distribution (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 11). i,j,k= xi,j,k xref,j,k(5) i,j,k= the safety pro\u0000les after receiving fractional dose compared with the standard dose group. We extracted the sample size and the number of adverse events (AEs, i.e., solicited local and/or systemic events, unsolicited events, and any AEs) for each dose group. Individual manifestations within each AE category were extracted and assessed. We estimated the pooled log risk ratio of experiencing AEs between fractional and standard dose group using RE model and stratifying by speci\u0000c AE and vaccine platform (Supplementary Fig. 12-17). We calculated the I2 to measure the heterogeneity of the included estimates. We also repeated the above analysis for higher dose group, which results can be found in our data repository.

FiguresPage 16/19 Figure 1 Pooled risk ratio (in log scale) of seroconversion between fractional and standard dose group of COVID- 19 vaccines. Number of seroconversion individuals and sample sizes were shown for the standard and nonstandard group, respectively.Page 17/19 Figure 2 Dose-response relationship of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and vaccine e\u0000cacy (VE) against ancestral strains induced by COVID-19 vaccines. (a) Dose-response relationship of nAbs against ancestral strains. nAbs were standardized as the ratio to the convalescent sera. A 2-dose schedule was assumed for RNA, protein subunit and inactivated vaccines, while 1-dose schedule was assumed for non-replicating viral vector.Dashed horizontal line indicates the average level of nAbs against ancestral strains in convalescent sera. (b) Dose-response relationship of predicted vaccine e\u0000cacy against symptomatic and severe infections of ancestral strains. (c) Association between reduction in vaccine e\u0000cacy and dose fractionation. Reductions in vaccine e\u0000cacy were measured as the ratio between vaccine e\u0000cacy against symptomatic or severe infections of ancestral strains between fractional and standard dose groups.Page 18/19 Figure 3 Predicted vaccine e\u0000cacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern after fully vaccinated with half-dose vaccines. Vaccine e\u0000cacy against symptomatic (a-e) and severe (f-j) infections after full vaccination of half-dose are shown, with the complete dose-dependent effectiveness are shown in Supplementary Figure 8-9. A 2-dose schedule was assumed for RNA, protein subunit and inactivated vaccines, while 1-dose schedule was assumed for non-replicating viral vector.Page 19/19 Figure 4 Comparison of T-cell responses against the ancestral strains elicited by dose fractioning of COVID-19 vaccines. Size of dots represent the total sample sizes of the standard and non-standard dose groups. (a) Compared to pre-vaccination. If the mean and 95% CI of the difference in mean T-cell levels before and after the fractional doses were all greater than 0, we determined T-cell responses were signi\u0000cantly higher between the groups. (b) Compared to people who received standard doses. If the mean and 95% CI of the difference in mean T-cell levels between the fractional and standard dose groups were all greater or less than 0, we determined T-cell responses were signi\u0000cantly higher or lower than that elicited by the standard dose.
