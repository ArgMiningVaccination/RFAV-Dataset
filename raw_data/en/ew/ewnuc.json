I doubt very much that the patients who recovered from typhoid and malaria after receiving homeopathic medicines from Mother Teresa's dispensary in Calcutta cared much about these theories, either. The civil war soldiers treated by homeopathic doctors for gangrene and gunshot wounds had never even heard of the New Age movement. The Christian woman I consulted with last week, whose twenty-year long struggle with rheumatoid arthritis ended in complete recovery, is certainly not interested in these theories! Homeopathy has saved the lives of millions of people of all races, ethnic groups and religions, especially during scarlet fever, smallpox, influenza, polio, cholera, typhoid and yellow fever epidemics. It has been practiced worldwide for more than two centuries and is recognized as a legitimate medical practice in many countries, including the United States. In this country, the production and marketing of homeopathic medicines is regulated by the FDA, and the medicines are produced in accordance with the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States, ever since the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act of 1938 was passed. They are derived mostly from natural sources, and they are usually given in attenuated form based on the similarity of symptoms. The object of homeopathic treatment is to stimulate the innate healing responses of the body. Homeopathic medicine is neither a movement, nor does it have anything to do with New Age. It is a tried and true medical practice and pharmaceutical science. It differs significantly from conventional medicine. It aims at curing diseases, rather than merely medicating the symptoms. It cures with minute doses of specially prepared drugs to activate the body's natural healing and restorative mechanisms. Homeopathy is compatible with Christian beliefs. Perhaps for that reason many Christians including clergy have studied and used homeopathy. It works with God's design in nature rather than against it. It adheres to the tenet to do no harm - ever! Conventional medicine, on the other hand, acts against the body's God-given healing mechanisms. For example, the body creates a fever to fight infections better. Conventional drugs bring down the fever and end up slowing down the recovery. Homeopathy cures infections by stimulating the immune response, which aids in the recovery. The widespread use of anti-inflammatories, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, etc. shows that today's conventional treatment aims mainly at inhibiting vital functions. To suppress symptoms, conventional doctors prescribe drugs in high doses that can cause harmful effects and occasionally even kill. Considering that over 100,000 Americans die each year from drug reactions (FDA figures). If homeopathic treatment were more widely available, it would go a long way in preventing those deaths. Homeopaths, however, select medicines so carefully, that they are able to work with such small doses that no toxic drug reactions ever occur. In the United States, at the beginning of the last century, one quarter of physicians had training in homeopathy. There were 22 homeopathic medical schools. The Iowa State Supreme Court upheld homeopathic immunizations against smallpox in 1907, after a study had found they were more effective than conventional vaccinations. That was before the Rockefellers of Standard Oil launched an assault on homeopathy with the Flexner Report in 1910. In 1939 the Rockefeller family founded the drug trust, a conglomerate of pharmaceutical manufacturers. Today less than 1% of doctors study homeopathy. Incidentally, the Rockefellers have been major supporters of the New Age movement. Homeopathic medicine, on the other hand, has had very few real friends among the elitist power behind that movement. On the contrary, the Rockefeller Foundation, the AMA, and the Pharmaceutical Advertising Council, have spends millions to keep people from finding out about homeopathy. This does not come as a surprise. Any medicine that cures takes money out of their pockets. Homeopathy can prevent surgery in many cases. It can often prevent blood transfusions. It renders vaccinations obsolete. It cures most chronic disorders by restoring health. The medicine promoted by the pharmaceutical industry, on the other hand, makes people dependent on drugs, often for life, and often causes more problems than it cures. While some starry eyed followers of the New Age movement may still think that the \"coming New Age\" will be one of true healing, the truth is, the movement's high priests have no such thing in mind. If freedom from lifelong treatment and prevention of disease were really part of the New Age agenda, I could only welcome that. But I have no reason to believe it is. The powers behind the New Age movement will continue to enforce a medicine of global mandatory vaccinations, surgeries, C-sections, blood transfusions, genetic alterations, abortions, artificial insemination, sterilization, birth control, euthanasia, mind altering drugs, along with the omnipresent \"miracle\" drugs. However, in the future, they may market these drugs as \"natural.\" And in hospitals, the temples of modern \"New Age\" medicine, you may not be allowed to pray while under the hands of the New Age high priests of medicine. They may allow some \"guru\" to come to your bed and try hands on healing. But only as long as you take your medicine! At the same time they may pass a law that prayer is no longer permitted in hospitals, and tell you that only tranquilizer drugs must be used from now on in "}
