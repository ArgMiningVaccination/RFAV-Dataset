Austin Public Health administered its first pediatric dose on November 2. In response, this survey fielded caregivers' opinions, questions, plans, and concerns regarding pediatric vaccination in support of Austin Public Health's preparation plan for pediatric vaccination. The survey was collected via Microsoft Forms and distributed to caregivers via schools. In our analysis of 11,479 responses , we found that: Most respondents did plan to vaccinate their 5 -11-year-old children Most respondents chose doctor's offices as their 1stchoice vaccination location oCommunity vaccination clinics like APH ranked 3rd Regardless of vaccination plan, respondents had concerns about the vaccine's safety and efficacy, adverse reactions and unknown long -term side effects Black, Latino, and Spanish speaking populations were all more likely to be unsure about vaccination than White, Asian, and English -speaking populations Focusing education and outreach efforts on unsure populations may prove effective and efficient in raising pediatric vaccination rates * Estimates of the Total Population of Counties in Texas by Age, Sex and Race/Ethnicity for July 1, 2019. Texas Demographic Cen ter, University of Texas at San AntonioSurvey Purpose An estimated 114,519 children aged 5 -11 in Travis County became eligible to receive Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine on October 29, 2021. * This survey was one part of Austin Public Health's ongoing efforts to prepare for pediatric vaccination and information gathered through the survey informed our pediatric distribution strategy and outreach efforts. Travis County area caregivers were asked about their planned course of action with respect to pediatric COVID -19 vaccinations. The survey gauged sentiments about the vaccine's safety, effectiveness, and allowed respondents to share questions and concerns. APH is using this survey's results in coordination with targeted efforts in priority zip codes and in person community engagements with caregivers of children in the newly qualified age range. *Estimates of the Total Population of Counties in Texas by Age, Sex and Race/Ethnicity for July 1, 2019. Texas Demographic Cen ter, University of Texas at San AntonioSurvey Administration and Data Collection Using APH's Schools and Child Care Taskforce school connections, APH was able to reach the caregivers through e -newsletters schools sent out. The survey was administered in English and Spanish on October 18 and in French, Korean, simplified and traditional Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, Burmese, and Vietnamese on October 26. It closed on November 7. Participants were asked to complete it through Microsoft Forms on their own time. Therefore, individuals with limited access to the internet or a personal device may be underrepresented. Survey data was downloaded from Microsoft Forms and converted into an Excel document for analysis. Survey Questions Respondents were asked to Share their race, ethnicity, school district, zip code, and the number of children aged 5 -11 in their household Indicate whether they plan to vaccinate their children aged 5 -11 years with the COVID -19 vaccine once it was approved under the Emergency Use Authorization Rate their agreement with statements on the safety and effectiveness of COVID -19 vaccine for 5 -11 age group Share what questions and concerns they had about the vaccine Respondents who answered \" yes\" or \" unsure \" to whether they plan to vaccinate their children were asked to Rank pediatric vaccination location preferences and submit their own suggestions Respondents who indicated that \" yes\", they plan to vaccinate their children were asked How soon they would get the vaccine Whether they would consent to in -school vaccinationSurvey Results The survey received 11,754 responses in total, among all languages. We excluded 135respondents whose zip codes were either invalid or outside of Travis and its neighboring counties, leaving 11,619 respondents. We excluded an additional 140respondents who entered 0 or values 99 or greater for the number of children aged 5 -11 in their household. No further results were excluded, resulting in 11,479 responses to analyze. By survey language we received 11,124 English, 351Spanish, 1Simplified Chinese, 1Korean, and 2French responses. Based on the question \"How many children aged 5 -11 years do you have in your household?\" we can estimate that these respondents are the caretakers of 17,373 children that have recently become eligible for the vaccineSurvey Results Total of 11,754 survey responses received 135responses with invalid or out of Travis county zip codes11,619 viable survey responses 140responses with 0or 99+ children 5-1111,479 survey 351in Spanish 2in French 1in Chinese 1in Korean Respondents have an estimated 17,373 children aged 5 -11 Respondents' School Districts 1045 3571436 15621529 315113263 1 4 1228 2 3162596 0500100015002000250030003500Respondents by School District Most respondents came from Pflugerville Followed by Zip Codes We received responses from 85separate zip codes.

After removing comments that did not express a question or concern, we had 3,467 responses for analysis: 1,678 responses (48%) were from those that do not plan to vaccinate 1,275 (37%) were from caregivers that do plan to vaccinate 465 (13%) were from unsure respondents 49 (1%) were from those that will only do so if requiredQuestions Among All Respondents Listed below are the most common questions, followed by their frequencies : What are the short -term side effects/adverse reactions? -596 How effective/necessary is it in children who had COVID -19 and now have antibodies? -162 How safe is the vaccine?

What is the plan for adverse effects? What time of day? How to address immediate side effects? When can previously infected children get vaccinated? What will happen to mask policy? How to address children at the cusps? Children that are almost 5; children that are underweight for their age Children that are almost 12; children that are overweight for their age The most common concerns were: Ability to access vaccine quickly Not enough children getting vaccinated to prevent spread Requests for a vaccine mandate and concern that vaccines will not be mandatedQuestions/Concerns Among \"Unsure\" Respondents Questions What are the ingredients of the vaccine? What were the results of the Pfizer pediatric studies? What was the sample size? How common were severe side effects? Concerns Schools mandating vaccines Many respondents are waiting for more data to come out Others are waiting for standard vaccine approval by the FDA (not EUA), or recommendation from their pediatriciansQuestions/Concerns Among \"No\" & \"If Required\" Respondents Questions What are the ingredients of the vaccine? Requests for the studies Pfizer presented and for data on infection and mortality rates for this age group Is the vaccine necessary for children because they are at such a low risk? Concerns Opposition to vaccine mandate for children Belief that the unknown side effects of the vaccine are more dangerous than COVID -19 Belief that the vaccine is ineffective against COVID -19 infection or spread Belief that the antibodies developed after a COVID infection provide stronger immunity than the vaccine Belief that the vaccine is illegitimate (allusions to media, medical, or governmental disinformation)Similarities or Differences in Responses by Demographics We see that Black, Latino, and Spanish speaking populations are all more likely to be unsure about vaccinating their children and to hold neutral opinions regarding the vaccine's safety and effectiveness than their counterparts, who are more likely to be firmly decided. Unsure respondents made up a small portion (8%) of the total survey population, but constituted 11% of Hispanic respondents, 12% of Black respondents, and 18% of Spanish language respondents. We see no discernable difference in the content of questions and concerns between English and Spanish respondents or between different races and ethnicities. A few responses expressed concerns over safety of the vaccine for specifically children of color and over equitable access to vaccination.Conclusions Most respondents, 63%, planned to vaccinate their 5 -11-year-old children, representing 10,580 children. Most respondents made doctor's offices their 1stchoice, followed by pharmacies. Community vaccination clinics, including APH, ranked 3rd. Respondents, regardless of their vaccination plan, had concerns about the vaccine's safety and efficacy, adverse reactions and unknown long -term effects. Many unsure respondents want to wait for more data to come out. Focusing education and outreach efforts on populations that are still unsure may prove effective and efficient in raising pediatric vaccination rates.Priority Zip Codes APH pediatric vaccine clinics are available most days of the week, providing evening and weekend opportunities. In addition, several zip codes have been identified as areas of priority due to high incidences of COVID -19 transmission and where the population is at disproportionately high risk. The following priority zip codes were selected for further analysis: 78617 (Del Valle) 78660 (Pflugerville) (Southwest Austin -Sunset Valley/South Congress) 78752 (St. Johns/Coronado Hills) Our findings include respondents' descriptive information, whether they plan to vaccinate their 5 -11- year-old children, how much they agree with statements about the COVID -19 vaccine's safety and effectiveness, and vaccination location preference.1% 6% 10% 3% 9% 70%Respondents by Race and Ethnicity Asian Black or African American White Other Prefer Not to Say Hispanic/Latino64% 9%1%26%Will Respondents Vaccinate their Children?
