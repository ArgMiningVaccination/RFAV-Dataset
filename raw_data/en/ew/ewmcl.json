Like how? Look, obviously we understand that when you try some- thing new for the first time like, say, worm charming or swagg bouncing or even oatmilk, it's natural to want to feel ready and able. But before we answer the question, please take a moment to consider two things: First, oatmilk is not like worm charming or swagg bouncing in a number of ways, most notably that oatmilk is not new, having been invented almost 30 years ago by us in Sweden as a plant- based milk alternative with the goal of maximum nutritional value and minimum environmental impact. We also designed it to require no worms or bouncing whatsoever. Second, if you've paused read- ing another riveting issue of The Atlantic to instead read this oatmilk ad, chances are you're already aware that oat- milk needs no prior study or rehearsal and we probably should've just led with that from the start. Seriously, if you've ever poured any liquid at all, consider yourself a highly trained individual. You can use the same hand and arm you normally do with oat- milk and the motions are pretty much identical. All that said, if you still feel like pre- paring for oatmilk, you could maybe try a couple of jumping jacks, some reverse lunges and a mild interest in lowering your climate footprint for the sake of all humankind. But no need to overdo it or anything.

Every member of Congress should get a copy in the mail, as should every board member of every major corpo-ration in this country. John N. Powers Wittenberg, Wis. I appreciate Anne Apple- baum's insights into the rise of self-serving and dangerous autocrats. She helpfully points at home. But to be dismis-sive of our country's mixed history\u2014 which is indeed mired in \"genocide, slavery, exploita-tion, and not much else\"\u2014is a little misleading. While I would not want to dismiss the ideals of self- governance embodied in our Constitution, we ignore our own sins at our peril. The expansionism of the Soviet Union during the Cold War needed to be resisted, but we had a tendency to prop up a lot of unsavory regimes that committed horrible crimes against their own people as long as they toed a pro- capitalist, anti-Communist line. Our nation has had di culty win-ning the political struggle that goes with counterinsurgency warfare by backing corrupt and brutal kleptocracies at least as disturbing as those Ms./uni00A0Applebaum is justi/f_i ably concerned about now. If we are to unite with our allies against such nefarious players, some acknowledg ment of our own sins of omission and commis-sion may be called for. Ed Behan Fort Collins, Colo. Anne Applebaum's perceptive account of advancing auto-crats will resonate in thought-ful circles for some time to come. She does, however, omit several key reasons the United States has lost global credibility, and will probably continue to do so.out that there is no particular ideology associated with these leaders and their regimes; the common thread is their ten-dency to accrue power, gener-ally to the bene/f_i t of themselves, their families, and their cronies. I do take issue with her cri- tique of \"a part of the Ameri-can left\" for abandoning the idea that America should more vigorously promote democracy abroad. I am on board with the need to strongly advocate for democracy, both abroad and Dictators have joined forces to advance their nefarious interests and undermine liberal democracy around the world, Anne Applebaum argued in December.The Autocrats Are WinningDISCUSSION & 1/17/2022 AM10ET H H E COM MONSLearn more at www.blackmagicdesign.comIntroducing DaVinci Resolve 17 Edit and color correct video with the same software used by Hollywood, for free!

The researchers found that major life events of both types can produce higher self-esteem and better relationships. Still, signi/f_icantly more research has been devoted to the impact of tough times than to the impact of happier ones (an example of what scientists call \"negativity bias\"), even though, for most of us, good things happen far more often. The change that emerges from positive experiences has a name too: post-ecstatic growth. In 2013, the clinical psycholo-gist Ann Marie Roepke coined the phrase, /f_inding that \"our best moments can inspire us, connect us to something greater than ourselves, and open our eyes to new possibilities.\" \u2014 Michelle Ciarrocca, Senior Associate Editor Behind the Cover: Finding happiness is complicated under the best of circum-stances, even more so during a pro-longed pandemic.

Here, Sabar answers a reader's question about his article. Q: /T_he issue of legitimate ownership of antiqui- ties is far from clear-cut. In many cases, artifacts were removed from their resting places decades ago with the full knowledge and consent of the authorities in power at the time. In other cases, today's unstable political situations in the origi-nating countries have shown their governments to be unsuitable guardians of historic treasures. Antiquities tracking is a prosecutable oense, but does the pursuit of legal remedies make sense in most cases? /T_he law is applied with the assumption that a country that exists today \"owns\" what is or was unearthed within its bor-ders, but should that be the case when the current inhabitants of a region aren't necessarily the true descendants of the object's original creators? \u2014 Michael P . Lustig, New York, N.Y.AMuseums, dealers, and others skeptical of the movement to return antiquities to their homelands have made similar arguments. But supporters of repatriation take a dierent view: First, the \"authorities in power at the time\" were in many cases colonial overseers, like the 19th-century Europeans who policed excavations on Egypt's \"behalf\" while thwarting archaeology by Egyptians and spiriting pharaonic artifacts to the West. Second, it is possible both to acknowledge a country's ownership of antiquities and to worry about\u2014and, ideally, help improve\u2014its ability to care for them. Finally, though the \"true descen-dants\" of an ancient sculptor or tomb designer may be open to debate, ownership is a legal con-cept de/f_ined by a patchwork of present-day laws. When Matthew Bogdanos, the chief of the Man-hattan district attorney's Antiquities T racking Unit, goes before judges to argue that an object is stolen, he relies on New York statute, foreign patrimony laws, and court precedent. He sees the wider ethics questions as beyond his prosecuto-rial brief\u2014and as a recipe, as he put it in one of our interviews, for \"paralysis by analysis.\"To respond to Atlantic articles or submit author questions to /T_he Commons, please email letters@theatlantic.com.

The conventional wis- dom that Latinos are reliable members of a liberal coalition of people of color has never been exactly right: Between a quarter and a third of Lati-nos have voted Republican in almost every presidential elec-tion for the past half century. Donald T rump grew his share of the Latino vote in 2020 compared with 2016, and he may be growing his share still. A November Wall Street Jour- nal poll found that Hispanic voters would be evenly split if T rump ran against Joe Biden in 2024. /T_hey were also evenly split when asked whether they would vote for Democrats or Republicans if the midterm elections were held that day. /T_he survey pool was admittedly a small one, but the possibility of a continued rightward shift is shaking Democrats' con/f_idence. How, I am often asked, can so many Latinos be willing to vote for T rump or his acolytes after he spent four years in oce maligning them? In some ways, it's an insult- ing question, because it pre-sumes that non-Latinos know our interests better than we do. I didn't support T rump, but my grandfather did. For a long time, Latinos like him have gravitated toward the Republican Party because of their belief in free-market capitalism, their opposition to big government, and their religious and cultural con-servatism. Many appreciated the booming economy of the T rump years, and worry about in/f_lation today. It's ridiculous to imagine that Latinos would all think, or vote, the same. /T_here are more than 60/uni00A0million of us\u2014 representatives of dierent national groups, with dierent accents, histories of migration, and cultural tastes. Has such a varied group ever formed a solid bloc? But America's inability to wrap its head around a fifth of its population suggests a deeper misunderstanding. It has to do with an ignorance of Latino history\u2014a messy history of colonization that is far more important to grasping our political diversity than any poll result could ever be. Too few Americans learn this history, in part because Lati-nos are rarely central to the ide-ological debates over race and racial justice in America. Or, more precisely, we are props in those debates, our story reduced to a simple tale of oppression consisting of the violent era-sure of our Indigenous heritage, resistance against colonialism, and victimization by imperial powers. In this view, only Lati-nos who are un conscious of their own inheritance would fail to align themselves with the left. As Representative Alexan-dria Ocasio- Cortez of New York put it in an interview, Latino politicians often advance \"really problematic policies\" because they don't \"know who they are.\" But who we are is compli- cated, and the future that many Latinos imagine\u2014for ourselves and for our country\u2014 does not /f_it neatly into the prevail-ing culture war. To understand that, it may be helpful to pause the angst over which box Lati-nos will check on their ballots this year or in 2024, and con-sider what can be learned from the past. /T.sc/h.sc/r.sc/o.sc/u.sc/g.sc/h.sc/o.sc/u.sc/t.sc /h.sc/i.sc/s.sc/t.sc/o.sc/r.sc/y.sc, Latinos have been both colo-nized and colonizers. By this, I don't mean simply the obvi-ous: that Latinos are mestizos, the mixed-race descendants of Indigenous Americans, Span-iards, Middle Easterners, Afri-cans, and other ethnic and racial groups. I also mean that Latinos have identi/f_ied not only as survivors of imperialism and its ills, but also as supporters of imperial and national powers. As the historian Serge Gruzin-ski put it in /T_he Mestizo Mind , the dierent groups that came together to forge Latino iden-tity were like \"prisoners in a maze,\" bound to one another by the pain of conquest and the imperative to build new socie-ties from the ashes. That pain, of course, was extraordinary. /T_he spread of the Spanish and American empires was achieved through great violence against African and Indigenous people and their mixed-race descendants. /T_hey were slaughtered, enslaved, and raped, their cultures and religions destroyed. /T_hese are necessary and hard truths, and they became more widely acknowledged in the mid-20th century, when de colonization movements swept the world and more people began speak-ing out against the legacies of white supremacy. When that happened, more Latinos began to identify with their Indigenous and African roots, in opposition to the old imperial powers. Some called for an Indigenous revival: Puerto Ricans claimed Ta\u00edno identity, and the Young Lords, an activist group fashioned after the Black Panthers, fought for Puerto Rican independence. Chicanos referred to the South-west as Aztl\u00e1n, the mythical homeland of the Aztecs. In 1972, Rodolfo Acu\u00f1a pub-lished his influential history Occupied America, which argued that Mexican Ameri-cans were internally colonized subjects of the United States. Activists in the U.S. saw their histories and futures as linked to those of other colonized populations. They founded advocacy groups, ran for oce, and argued that people of color should work together to build power. /T_hey have since shaped how Latinos are portrayed in the news and in popular culture. As Latinos themselves, they are unimpeachable experts on Latino identity. But the pundi tocracy of Democratic politicians, strategists, and con-sultants has painted an incom-plete picture of Latino history. Many Americans have ceded to them the representation of all Latinos, instead of seeking out more complex narratives. They seem to have forgotten\u2014 or don't want to remember\u2014that in the centu-ries since the initial collision of Europe and the New World, many Latinos have chosen to align themselves with the imperial and national projects of Spain, the United States, or MANY LATINOS PREFER TO IDENTIFY WITH A PARTICULAR THREAD OF THEIR ANCESTRY. BUT NO ONE THREAD TELLS THE WHOLE STORY. 0322_DIS_Cadava_LeadLatinoVoters [Print]_15910463.indd 16 1/14/2022 11:21:58 AM16 /one.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstyle ILLUSTRATION BY DANIELLE DEL PLATOOPENING ARGUMENT the independent nations of Latin America. Across the 19th century, many Latin Americans viewed the United States as the economic and political model for their own countries, seek-ing alliances with, and maybe even annexation by, the north-ern colossus. In the 1830s, Mexicans fought on both sides of the Texas Revolution. After the Mexican-American War in the 1840s, when the United States took half of Mexico's land, the overwhelming majority of Mex-icans who lived in the former Mexican territory chose to stay and become U.S. citizens. In a bizarre episode from the 1850s, during a power struggle in Nica-ragua, one faction invited the American mercenary William Walker to come \"civilize\" their country. He rigged the vote and got himself elected president for almost a year, until his support-ers soured on him. At the close of the century, after Puerto Rico and Cuba won their independence from Spain, some wanted the United States to remain involved in the governance of the islands, even if that meant freedom from one empire through absorption by another. A contingent of prom-inent Puerto Ricans tried, and are still trying, to convince the United States and fellow island-ers that Puerto Rico should become a state. (In a 2020 referendum, just over half of Puerto Ricans said they sup-ported statehood.) Latinos who cast their lot with the United States had their reasons\u2014economic, political, and cultural. Many felt that Spain was tradition-bound and backwards- looking, while the U.S., a modern lib-eral democracy, represented progress. Some established businesses that relied on U.S. investment, sent their children to school in the North, trea-sured its social and religious liberties, and converted from Catholicism to evangelical-ism. It is certainly the case that many of those seeking inclusion have been excluded from full citizenship or stymied by rac-ism. But that experience hasn't always shaken their faith that the United States stands for opportunity and prosperity, nor has it blunted their patriotism. /T.sc/h.sc/e.sc /F.sc/r.sc/e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/h.sc West Indian philosopher Frantz Fanon, in 1952's Black Skin, White Masks, argued that colonized people identify with their colonizers\u2014 wanting to walk, talk, and dress like them, and to have sex with them\u2014because of a colonial \"inferiority complex.\" His views are echoed by many liberal Lati-nos today, who consider their more conservative counterparts sellouts, as if they are somehow not \"real\" Latinos. Watch YouT ube videos of people revealing the results of their DNA tests, and the dis- comfort can be palpable. An Afro-Latina in one was taken aback because she \"wanted to be more Black,\" want to be a part of coloniza- tion.\" A man in another was \"trippin',\" he said, because he'd learned that he was 31/uni00A0percent Spanish. On a podcast, the journalist Maria Hinojosa said she had to \"come to terms with the fact that I have conquista-dor blood in me,\" but that she deliberately identifies more with her Indigenous heritage. Many Latinos prefer to iden- tify with a particular thread of their ancestry as a way of con-necting with a culture that they feel was stolen from them, and there's nothing wrong with that. But no one thread tells the whole story. A contemporary of Fanon's, the French T unisian writer Albert Memmi, argued that the colonizer and the col-onized are inextricably tied to each other and can even inhabit the same body. /T_hey de/f_ine their struggles and desires in relation to each other. To be connected in this way has a psychological cost, but it is also a fact. When it comes to Latino history, I find Memmi's take more useful than Fanon's. I have always been curious about my identity as a Latino. My dad's family is Mexican, Colombian, Panamanian, and Filipino. My mom's family is white, from Germany, Scot-land, and England. /T_hey lived across the street from each other in the border lands of T ucson, Arizona, in the 1970s, when both of my grand fathers were stationed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. My parents got divorced, and much of my childhood was divided between these two families. I was educated in the predominantly white com-munities of Irvine, California, and then Princeton, New Jer-sey, where my father worked as an English professor. Summers and breaks I spent in T ucson, where my mom's brother called me \"green bean,\" because I was half gringo and half \"beaner.\" My paternal grandparents spoke to me in Spanish, but I began studying the language formally only when I was in middle school. My father schooled me more in the writ-ings of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walter Benjamin than in those of Octavio Paz, Gloria Anzald\u00faa, or Sandra Cisneros. In college and grad school, I tried to make up for what I had missed, and worked toward becoming a scholar of Latino history. It's possible that all of the reading and writing I've done since has been an eort to understand both sides of my identity, and how my experi-ence /f_its within the broader pat-terns of that history. If you're wondering whether my argu-ment about Latinos as both colonizers and colonized is the result of my own identi/f_ication with both, you're right. How could it be otherwise? /A.sc /d.sc/e.sc/s.sc/i.sc/g.sc/n.sc /c.sc/h.sc/a.sc/n.sc/g.sc/e.sc in the latest census allowed people to more easily identify them-selves as mixed-race. /T_his helps explain why the percentage of Hispanics who said they were of two or more races instead of, for example, only white or only Black increased dramatically\u2014 by 576/uni00A0percent. At the same time, demographic and cultural shifts have meant that there are both more mixed-race Ameri-cans and more Americans who understand themselves as mixed-race. /T_hose who believe that race is a pernicious and arti/f_icial construct should wel-come the ways in which Latinos are embracing more compli-cated narratives of themselves and their country. Americans of all races are engaging in debates about our national origins because we sense that something is bro-ken. I admire how the 1619 Project, from The New York Times, challenged us to recon-sider U.S. history, with slavery and its afterlives as the corner-stone. One problem with the project, though, and with the T rump administration's answer-ing 1776 Commission, is that the framing of each reinforces a Black-versus-white vision of American history. Addressing the legacy of slavery is vital. But adding Latino history (itself, in part, a history of slav-ery) to the story of American origins would help us think in brown, the color of \"impurity,\" as the writer Richard Rodriguez described it some 20 years ago. America has always been many things at once. If we limit our understanding of the nation's beginnings to the Brit-ish colonies, then how could Latinos and members of other groups be anything besides outsiders and latecomers who should be compelled to assimi-late? /T_he slogan \"America is a nation of immigrants\" is sup-posed to make us feel included. But we are all original Ameri-cans, and we all shaped the United States before there was a United States. By recounting this long his- tory, I am not trying to suggest what Latinos should believe. I am only saying that when we vote, we aren't just casting bal-lots about health care or edu-cation policy. We are express-ing political identities that have evolved over centuries\u2014 for and against expanding empires and nation-states; for and against more radical forms of egalitarianism\u2014 in ways that don't always /f_it neatly into the rhetoric of the left-right divide. This is why many Lati- nos support tougher border controls to limit the in/f_lux of undocumented immigrants, whom they may see as threaten-ing their own privileges or sense of belonging as U.S. citizens. It is why many /f_ind the Republi-can Party's emphasis on love of country so appealing. Understanding this history won't allow anyone to predict \"the Latino vote\" with pin-point accuracy. But it would at least help free us from the myth that Americans vote according to a historical ideas of inherited guilt or innocence. And it should remind us that we are in some way bound to one another\u2014that for better or worse, what it means to be Latino and what it means to be American are intertwined. Geraldo L.

Dancing /f_lames cast an orange glow on the side of the boy's face; silhouettes of bare trees ornament the distance. /T_he image is part of a series that Eskildsen began 16 years ago. After he and his partner spent 15 years traveling across Europe taking photographs, his partner became pregnant with their son, and Eskildsen realized that his work could no longer entail extensive travel. \"I decided at that moment, I'm going to be a present father,\" he told me recently. And so he redirected his camera closer to home, taking photographs only of things that were within walking distance. Home has taken on new meaning in these pandemic years, as so many of us have paid closer attention to all that surrounds us. I have learned more about my two young children in these years than would have otherwise been possible. At the same time, with our climate on the cusp of irreversible catastrophe, I have spent more time than ever before contemplating how each of our fates is inextricably linked to the actions of everyone else. Home is more than simply the residence where we sleep. It is the people we hold, and the planet that holds us. My son is 4, and obsessed with space. Hanging on the wall of his bedroom is a poster of the solar system. /T_he sun sits at the center, with each of the eight plan-ets encircling the yellow-orange orb, their respective orbits depicted by thin white lines that make it look as if each is being held up in the universe by a string. He dreams of being an astronaut (and a chef and a super-hero and a dinosaur). When he looks up into the night sky, the unadulterated wonder in his eyes reminds me how remarkable our presence on this fragile planet is. \u2014 Clint Smith 0322_DIS_Viewfinder_Eskildsen [Print]_15904665.indd 21 1/14/2022 11:22:27 AM /two.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyleHOW TO FIND HAPPINESS ILLUSTRATIONS BY PAULSPELLA MARCH 2022 /two.taboldstyle/two.taboldstyleTHE SATISFACTION TRAP NO MATTER WHAT WE ACHIEVE OR ATTAIN, OUR BIOLOGY ALWAYS LEAVES US WANTING MORE.

Instead, she was laughing uproariously at a video she had found. I asked her what she was looking at. \"It's an old man dancing like a chicken and singing,\" she told me. I came over to her laptop, not being above watching someone making an idiot of himself for 15 seconds of social-media fame. What I found instead was the septuagenarian rock star Mick Jag-ger, in a fairly recent concert, croaking out the Rolling Stones' megahit \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"\u2014a song that debuted on the charts when I was a year old\u2014for probably the millionth time. An audience of tens of thousands of what looked to be mostly Baby Boomers and Gen/uni00A0Xers sang along rapturously. \"Is this serious?\" she asked. \"Do people your age actually like this?\" I took umbrage, but had to admit it was a legitimate question. \"Kind of,\" I answered. It wasn't just the music, or even the performance, I assured her. To my mind, the longevity of that particular song\u2014 No./uni00A02 on Rolling Stone magazine's original list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\"\u2014has a lot to do with a deep truth it speaks. As we wind our way through life, I explained, satisfaction\u2014the joy from ful/f_illment of our wishes or expectations\u2014is evanescent. No matter what we achieve, see, acquire, or do, it seems to slip from our grasp. I was on a roll now. Satisfaction, I told my daughter, is the great- est paradox of human life. We crave it, we believe we can get it, we glimpse it and maybe even experience it for a brief moment, and then it vanishes. But we never give up on our quest to get and hold on to it. \"I try, and I try, and I try, and I try,\" Jagger sings. How? /T_hrough sex and consumerism, according to the song. By building a life that is ever more baroque, expensive, and laden with crap. \"You'll see,\" I told her.My daughter's mirth now utterly extinguished, she had the expression I imagine Jean-Paul Sartre's daughter must have had every day. \"So life is just a rat race, and we're doomed to an exis-tence of dissatisfaction?\" she asked. \"/T_hat sucks.\"\"It does suck,\" I said. \"But we're not doomed.\" I told her we can beat this aiction if we work to truly understand it\u2014and if we're willing to make some dicult changes to the way we live. \"Like what?\" she asked, her eyes narrowing with the healthy suspicion that comes from being the child of a social scientist, and thus an unwitting participant in many behavioral experiments. I paused. It was in fact a question to which I'd devoted a lot of my time over the previous few years\u2014not just professionally but personally, and with sometimes uneven results. /E.sc/v.sc/e.sc/n.sc /t.sc/h.sc/e.sc /m.sc/o.sc/s.sc/t.sc successful people suer from the dissatisfac- tion problem. I remember once seeing LeBron James\u2014the world's greatest basketball player\u2014with a look of abject despair on his face after his Cleveland Cavaliers lost the NBA championship to the Golden State Warriors. All of the world's wealth and accolades were like straw in that moment of loss. Abd al-Rahman/uni00A0III, the emir and caliph of C\u00f3rdoba in 10th- century Spain, summed up a life of worldly success at about age 70: \"I have now reigned above 50 years in victory or peace; beloved by my subjects, dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies. Riches and honors, power and pleasure, have waited on my call.\" And the payo? \"I have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot,\" he wrote. \"/T_hey amount to 14.\" As an observer, I understand the problem. I write a column about human happiness for /T_he Atlantic and teach classes on the subject at Harvard. I know that satisfaction is one of the core \"macronutrients\" of happiness (the other two being enjoyment and meaning), and that its slippery nature is one of the reasons happiness is often so elusive as well. Yet time and again, I have fallen into the trap of believing that success and its accompaniments would ful/f_ill me. On my 40th birthday I made a bucket list of things I hoped to do or achieve. /T_hey were mainly accomplishments only a wonk could want: writing books and columns about serious subjects, teaching at a top school, traveling to give lectures and speeches, maybe even leading a university or think tank. Whether these were good and noble goals or not, they were my goals, and I imagined that if I hit them, I would be satis/f_ied. I found that list nine years ago, when I was 48, and realized that I had achieved every item on it. I had been a tenured pro-fessor, then the president of a think tank. I was giving frequent speeches, had written some books that had sold well, and was writing columns for /T_he New York Times. But none of that had brought me the lasting joy I'd envisioned. Each accomplishment thrilled me for a day or a week\u2014maybe a month, never more\u2014and then I reached for the next rung on the ladder. I'd devoted my life to climbing those rungs. I was still devoting my life to climbing\u2014beavering away 60 to 80 hours a week to accomplish the next thing, all the while terri/f_ied of losing the last thing. /T_he costs of that kind of existence are exceedingly obvious, but it was only when I looked back at my list that I genuinely began to question the bene/f_its\u2014and to think seriously about the path I was walking. And what about you? 0322_WEL_Brooks_Satisfaction [Print]_15892097.indd 24 1/17/2022 2:33:52 PM24 /two.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyleYour goals are probably very di erent from mine, and perhaps your lifestyle is too. But the trap is the same. Everyone has dreams, and they beckon with promises of sweet, lasting satisfaction if you achieve them. But dreams are liars. When they come true, it's/uni00A0... /f_i ne, for a while. And then a new dream appears. /M.sc/i.sc/c.sc/k.sc /J.sc/a.sc/g.sc/g.sc/e.sc/r.sc'/s.sc /s.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/s.sc/f.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc /d.sc/i.sc/l.sc/e.sc/m.sc/m.sc/a.sc \u2014and ours\u2014 starts with a rudimentary formula: Satisfaction = getting what you want . It's so simple, and yet its power is deeply encoded within us. Give a 3-year-old the french fry she is reaching for and see her satis/f_i ed expression. But then, after a couple of seconds, watch the wanting return. And that's the actual problem, isn't it? /T_h e Stones' song should really have been titled \"(I Can't Keep No) Satisfaction.\" It's almost as if our brains are programmed to prevent us from enjoying anything for very long. In fact, they are. The term homeostasis was introduced in 1926 by a physiologist named Walter B./uni00A0Cannon, who showed in his book The Wisdom of the Body that we have built-in mech- anisms to regulate our tempera-ture, as well as our levels of oxy-gen, water, salt, sugar, protein, fat, and calcium. But the concept applies much more broadly than that: To survive, all living systems tend to maintain stable conditions as best they can. Homeostasis keeps us alive and healthy. But it also explains why drugs and alcohol work as they do, as opposed to how we wish they would. While that /f_i rst dose of a new recreational sub-stance might give you great plea-sure, your previously naive brain quickly learns to sense an assault on its equilibrium and fights back by neutralizing the e ect of the entering drug, making it im possible to get the /f_i rst feeling back. As the Bucknell University neuroscientist Judith Grisel explains brilliantly in her book, Never Enough: /T_h e Neuro science and Experience of Addiction, addiction is in part a by-product of homeostasis: As the brain becomes used to continual drug-induced production of dopamine \u2014the neurotransmitter of pleasure, which plays a large role in nearly all addictive behaviors\u2014it steeply curtails ordinary production, making another hit necessary simply to feel normal. /T_h e same set of principles works on our emotions. When you get an emotional shock\u2014good or bad\u2014your brain wants to re-equilibrate, making it hard to stay on the high or low for very long. /T_h is is especially true when it comes to positive emotions, for primordial reasons that we'll get into shortly. It's why, when you achieve conventional, acquisitive success, you can never get enough. If you base your sense of self-worth on success\u2014money, power, prestige\u2014you will run from victory to victory, initially to keep feeling good, and then to avoid feeling awful. /T_h e unending race against the headwinds of homeostasis has a name: the \"hedonic treadmill.\" No matter how fast we run, we never arrive. \"At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness,\" Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in his 1841 essay, \"Self-Reliance.\" \"I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I /f_l ed from.\" Scholars argue over whether our happiness has an immutable set point, or if it might move around a little over the course of our life due to general circumstances. But no one has ever found that immediate bliss from a major victory or achievement will endure. As for money, more of it helps up to a point\u2014it can buy things and services that relieve the problems of poverty, which are sources of unhappiness. But for- ever chasing money as a source of enduring satisfaction simply does not work. \"/T_h e nature of [adapta-tion] condemns men to live on a hedonic treadmill,\" the psycholo-gists Philip Brickman and Don-ald T./uni00A0Campbell wrote in 1971, \"to seek new levels of stimulation merely to maintain old levels of subjective pleasure, to never achieve any kind of permanent happiness or satisfaction.\" Yet even if you recognize all this, getting o the treadmill is hard. It feels dangerous. Our urge for more is quite powerful, but stronger still is our resistance to less. /T_h at's one of the insights that earned Princeton's Daniel Kahneman the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics, for work he did with the late Stanford psychologist Amos Tversky. So you try and you try, but you make no lasting progress toward your goal. You /f_i nd yourself running simply to avoid being thrown o the back of the treadmill. /T_h e wealthy keep accumulating far beyond anything they could possibly spend, and sometimes more than they want to bequeath to their children. /T_h ey hope that at some point they will feel happy, their lives complete, and are terri/f_i ed of what will happen if they stop run-ning. As the great 19th-century philosopher Arthur Schopen hauer said, \"Wealth is like sea-water; the more we drink, the thirstier we become; and the same is /t.sc/o.sc /e.sc/v.sc/o.sc/l.sc/u.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc /p.sc/s.sc/y.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/o.sc/g.sc/y.sc, our ten- more is perfectly understandable. /T_h roughout most of human history, starvation loomed closer than it does, for Getting off the treadmill is hard.

A \"rich\" caveman had a few extra animal skins and arrowheads, and maybe a few piles of seeds and dried /f_ish to spare. With this plenty, he might survive a bad winter. Our troglodyte ancestors didn't just want to make it through the winter, though; they had bigger ambitions. /T_hey wanted to /f_ind allies and mates too, with the goal (whether conscious or not) of passing on their genes. And what would make that possible? Among other things, the accumulation of animal skins, demon-strating greater competence, prowess, and attractiveness than the hominid in the next cave over. Surprisingly little has changed since then. Scholars have shown that our acquisitive tendencies persist amid plenty and regularly exceed our needs. /T_his owes to our vestigial urges\u2014software that still exists in our brains from ancient times. Competing with rivals for mates helps explain our weird /f_ixation on social comparison. When we think about satisfaction from suc-cess (or possessions or /f_itness or good looks), there's another element to consider: Success is relative. Satisfaction requires not just that you continuously run in place on your own hedonic treadmill, but that you run slightly faster than other people are running on theirs. /T_his is why people with hundreds of millions of dollars can feel like failures if their friends are billionaires, and why famous Holly-wood actors can be despondent that others are even more famous. At some level, we all know that social comparison is ridiculous and harmful, and extensive research con/f_irms this: \"Keeping up with the Joneses\" is associated with anxiety and even depression. In a series of experiments that required subjects to solve puzzles, for instance, the unhappiest people were consistently those paying the most attention to how they performed relative to other subjects. /T_he small rush of pleasure we get from doing better than some can easily be swallowed up by the unhappiness from doing worse than others. But the urge to have more than others, to be more than others, tugs at us relentlessly. We live in a time when we are regularly counseled to get back to nature, to our long-ago past\u2014in our diets, our sense of communal obligation, and more. But if our goal is happiness that endures, following our natural urges does not help us, in the main. /T_hat is Mother Nature's cruel hoax. Happiness doesn't help propagate the species, so nature doesn't select for it. If you con/f_late inter generational survival with happiness, that's your problem, not nature's. In fact, our natural state is dissatisfaction, punctuated by brief moments of satisfaction. You might not like the hedonic 0322_WEL_Brooks_Satisfaction [Print]_15892097.indd 26 1/17/2022 2:33:53 PM26 /two.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstyletreadmill, but Mother Nature thinks it's pretty great. She likes watching you strive to achieve an elusive goal, because strivers get the goods\u2014even if they don't enjoy them for long. More mates, better mates, better chances of survival for our children\u2014these ancient mandates are responsible for much of the code that runs incessantly in the deep recesses of our brains. It doesn't matter whether you've found your soul mate and would never stray; the algorithms designed to get us more mates (or allow us to make an upgrade) continue whirring, which is why you still want to be attractive to strangers. Neurobiological instinct\u2014which we experience as dissatisfaction\u2014is what drives us forward. /T_here are many other, related examples of evolved tenden- cies that militate against enduring happiness\u2014for example, the tendency toward jealous misery in our romantic relationships. (Mother Nature, while inviting us to cheat, would also like us to be highly alert to the possibility that our partner might be cheat-ing. Studies /f_ind that men, who are at risk of spending resources to unwittingly raise children who aren't theirs, /f_ixate most on sexual in/f_idelity; women, who are at risk that their mate will become attached to\u2014 and thus divert resources to\u2014another female and her children, respond most negatively to emotional in/f_idelity.) /T_he insatiable goals to acquire more, succeed conspicuously, and be as attractive as possible lead us to objectify one another, and even ourselves. When people see themselves as little more than their attractive bodies, jobs, or bank accounts, it brings great suering. Studies show that self-objecti/f_ication is associated with a sense of invisibility and lack of autonomy, and physical self-objecti/f_ication has a direct relation ship with eating disorders and depression in women. Professional self-objecti/f_ication is a tyranny every bit as nasty. You become a heartless taskmaster to yourself, seeing yourself as nothing more than Homo economicus. Love and fun are sacri/f_iced for another day of work, in search of a positive internal answer to the question Am I successful yet? We become cardboard cutouts of real people. It makes no sense in modern life to use our energies to have /f_ive cars, /f_ive bathrooms, or even /f_ive pairs of sneakers, but we just/uni00A0... want them. Neuroscientists have looked into this. Dopa-mine is excreted in response to thoughts about buying new things, winning money, acquiring more power or fame, having new sex-ual partners. /T_he brain evolved to reward us for the behaviors that kept us alive and made us more likely to pass on our DNA. /T_his may be an anachronism, at least to some degree, but it is a fact of our lives nonetheless. /F.sc/o.sc/r.sc /t.sc/h.sc/e.sc /f.sc/a.sc/i.sc/t.sc/h.sc/f.sc/u.sc/l.sc, satisfaction has another name: heaven. Many religions promise heaven to believers. We rarely think carefully about what that entails\u2014harps and clouds?\u2014but the Roman Catholic Church is helpfully speci/f_ic about it. Heaven grants us the \"beati/f_ic vision\": God showing himself to us face-to-face, making us know his true nature\u2014and thereby granting us the \"ful/f_illment of the deepest human longings, the state of supreme, de/f_initive happiness.\" Or, as the English mystic Juliana of Norwich wrote of heaven, \"all shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well.\" In other words, heaven is pure satisfaction that lasts. Why can't we seem to be so well on Earth? /T_he 13th-century Catholic priest /T_homas magisterial Summa /T_heologiae. He de/f_ines the satisfaction problem as one of misbegotten goals: idols that distract us from God, the true source of our bliss. Even if you are not a religious believer, /T_homas's list of the goals that beguile but never satisfy rings true. /T_hey include money, power, pleasure, and honor. As /T_homas puts it in the case of money, In the desire for wealth and for whatsoever temporal goods/uni00A0... when we already possess them, we despise them, and seek others/uni00A0... /T_he reason of this is that we realize more their insuciency when we possess them: and this very fact shows that they are imperfect, and the sovereign good does not consist therein. In other words, (It don 't bring no) satisfaction. /T_homas Aquinas might not /f_ill a stadium with Boomers, but he describes the Jag- gerian Dissatisfaction Matrix far better than old Mick himself. /T_he satisfaction problem, then, is our natural attachment to these inadequate things. If this sounds a bit Buddhist to you, it should. It is very similar to the Buddha's /f_irst \"Noble T ruth\": that life is suering\u2014duhka in Sanskrit, also translated as \"dissatisfaction\"\u2014 and that the cause of this suering is craving, desire, and attachment to worldly things. /T_homas Aquinas and the Buddha (and Jagger, for that matter) were saying the same thing. Note that neither /T_homas nor the Buddha argued that worldly rewards are inherently evil. In fact, they can be used for great good. Money is crucial for a functioning society and supporting your family; power can be wielded to lift others up; pleasure leav-ens life; and honor can attract attention to the sources of moral elevation. But as attachments\u2014as ends instead of means\u2014the problem is simple: /T_hey cannot satisfy. And this leads us back to my daughter's question: Are we doomed, in this earthly life at least, to an existence of continual dissatisfaction? /I.sc/f.sc /y.sc/o.sc/u.sc /e.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc visit Taiwan, the one attraction you must not miss is the National Palace Museum. Arguably the greatest collection of Chinese art and artifacts in the world, the museum contains roughly 700,000 items whose dates range from more than 8,000 years ago, during the Neolithic period, all the way to the modern era. If there is one problem with the museum, it is precisely its abundance. No one can take in more than a fraction of it in a single visit. /T_hat's why, one afternoon a few years ago, I hired a guide to show me a few famous pieces and explain their signi/f_icance. Little did I know that, with one remark, my guide was about to help me crack my own satisfaction puzzle. Looking at a massive jade carving of the Buddha from the Qing dynasty, my guide ohandedly remarked that this was a good illustration of how the Eastern view of art diers from the Western view. \"How so?\" I asked. He answered my question with a question: \"What do you think of when I ask you to imagine a work of art yet to be started?\" \"An empty canvas, I guess,\" I responded. \"Right,\" he said. Many Westerners tend to see art as being created from nothing. But there's another way to view it: exists,\" and the job of artists is simply to reveal it. He told me that his image of art yet to be started was an uncarved block of jade, like what ultimately became the Buddha in front of us. /T_he art is not visible until the artist takes away the stone that is not part of the sculpture, but it is already there nonethe-less. Not all artistic philosophy /f_its this East-versus-West distinc-tion; Michelangelo once said, \"/T_he sculpture is already complete within the marble block, before I start my work/uni00A0... I just have to chisel away the super/f_luous material.\" But I took my guide's point in\u2014as it were\u2014broad strokes. Art mirrors life, and therein lies a potential solution to the satisfaction dilemma. As we grow older in the West, we generally think we should have a lot to show for our lives\u2014a lot of trophies. According to numerous Eastern philosophies, this is backwards. As we age, we shouldn't accumulate more to represent ourselves, but rather strip things away to /f_ind our true selves\u2014and thus, to /f_ind happiness and peace. /T_he T ao T e Ching, a Chinese text compiled around the fourth century B.C. that is the foundation of Taoism, makes this point with elegance: People would be content with their simple, everyday lives,in harmony, and free of desire. When there is no desire, all things are at peace. In my early 50s, when I visited the National Palace Museum, my life was jammed with possessions, accomplishments, relation- ships, opinions, and commitments. It took an ohand remark from a museum guide to help me absorb the teachings of /T_homas Aquinas and the Buddha\u2014or for that matter, modern social science\u2014 and commit to stop trying to add more and more, but instead start taking things away. In truth, our formula, Satisfaction = getting what you want, leaves out one key component. To be more accurate, it should be: Satisfaction = what you have \u00f7 what you want All of our evolutionary and biological imperatives focus us on increasing the numerator\u2014our haves. But the more signi/f_icant action is in the denominator\u2014our wants. /T_he modern world is made up of clever ways to make our wants explode without us realizing it. Even the Dalai Lama, arguably the world's most enlightened man, admits to it. \"Sometimes I visit supermarkets,\" he says in /T_he Art of Happiness. \"I really love to see supermarkets, because I can see so many beautiful things. So, when I look at all these dierent articles, I develop a feeling of desire, and my initial impulse might be, 'Oh, I want this; I want that.' \" /T_he secret to satisfaction is not to increase our haves\u2014that will never work (or at least, it will never last). /T_hat is the treadmill formula, not the satisfaction formula. /T_he secret is to manage our wants. By managing what we want instead of what we have, we give ourselves a chance to lead more satis/f_ied lives./T_hese were the ideas I related to my daughter that spring after- noon. She listened with interest, then made a brief rejoinder. \"So what you're saying is that the secret to satisfaction is simple,\" she said. \"I just have to go against several million years of evolutionary biology,\" plus the entirety of modern culture, \"and I'll be all set.\" Obviously, I couldn't leave the topic there. One of the reasons people often don't trust academics like me is that we always talk about problems, but rarely provide realistic solutions. Even worse, we often ignore our own wisdom. I've known plenty of bankrupt economists and miserable happiness experts. But she knew this wasn't all just theory to me. We'd moved two years before, from Bethesda, Maryland, a power suburb of Wash-ington, D.C., to a small town outside Boston. I'd resigned from a chief-executive position to teach and write, trading away virtually all day-to-day contact with political and business elites\u2014 and was quickly forgotten by most. I hadn't hidden the reason for the move, and my family was fully behind it: I was taking my own advice, published in these pages three years ago, to /f_ind a new kind of suc-cess and a deeper kind of happiness. /T_hat project was not about satisfaction alone; it also involved recognizing that, professionally, most people peak earlier in life than they expect to, and decline faster\u2014and that to resist this is counter productive and ultimately futile. But it entailed getting o the hedonic treadmill\u2014 swapping evanescent professional thrills for more enduring ful/f_illment that could last well into the back half of my life. When life's rhythms involuntarily slowed further during the pandemic, I had all the more time to think about making that transition work. So I did have some practical suggestions for my daughter on how to beat the dissatisfaction curse\u2014three habits I have developed for my own life that are grounded in philosophy and social-science research. I. GO FROM PRINCE TO SAGE One scholar who did propose real solutions to life's problems was /T_homas Aquinas. He didn't just explain the satisfaction conun-drum; he oered an answer and lived it himself. /T_he youngest son of Count Landulf of Aquino, /T_homas was born around 1225 in his family's castle in central Italy. He was sent to be educated at the /f_irst Benedictine monastery, at Montecassino. As the youngest son of a noble family, he was expected to one day become the abbot of the monastery, a post of enormous social prestige. But /T_homas had no interest in this worldly glory. Around the age of 19, he joined the recently created Dominican order, a group of friars dedicated to poverty and itinerant preaching. /T_his, he felt, was his true identity. /T_he life of wealth and privilege needed to be chipped away to /f_ind it. /T_homas pursued the work of a scholar and teacher, producing dense philosophical treatises that are still profoundly in/f_luential today. He is known as the greatest philosopher of his age. But this legacy was never his aim. On the contrary, he considered his work to be nothing more than an expression of his love for God and a desire to help his fellow human beings. /T_he Buddha cracked the satisfaction code in a strikingly similar way. He was born a prince named Siddhartha Gautama around the sixth century/uni00A0B.C., in the region that is now on the border 0322_WEL_Brooks_Satisfaction [Print]_15892097.indd 28 1/17/2022 2:33:54 PM28 /two.taboldstyle/nine.taboldstylebetween Nepal and India. After his mother died just days after his birth, his father vowed to protect the infant prince from life's miseries, and thus kept him shut inside the palace, where all his earthly needs and desires would be met. Siddhartha never ventured beyond that palace until he was 29 years old, when, overcome by curiosity, he asked a charioteer to show him the outside world. On his tour, he encountered an old man, another man wracked with disease, and a decaying corpse. He was troubled by these sights, which his charioteer told him were inevitable in our mortal lives. He then encountered an ascetic who, through renunciation of worldly goods, had achieved not a release from disease and death but, rather, a release from the fear of them. Siddhartha left his kingdom soon after, and renounced all his attachments. Sitting under the Bodhi tree, he became the Buddha. He spent the rest of his life sharing his wisdom with a growing /f_lock that today numbers more than half a billion people. I am no Saint /T_homas and no Lord Buddha. And my current post at Harvard hardly quali/f_ies as a repudiation of the world's rewards. Even so, I've tried to take a lesson from their lives\u2014that satisfaction lies not in attaining high status and holding on to it for dear life, but in helping other people\u2014including by sharing whatever knowledge and wisdom I've acquired. /T_hat's one rea-son I stepped down from a job in the public eye to concentrate on writing and teaching. If I take another leadership role in my career, my focus will be on what I want to share with others, not what I want to accumulate for myself.II. MAKE A REVERSE BUCKET LIST One practical way to whittle down our wants is to simply look at the counsel we get that is turning us into dissatis/f_ied Homo eco- nomicus, and then do the opposite. For example, many self-help guides suggest making a bucket list on your birthday, so as to rein-force your worldly aspirations. Making a list of the things you want is temporarily satisfying, because it stimulates dopamine. But it cre-ates attachments, which in turn create dissatisfaction as they grow. I've instead begun to compile a \"reverse bucket list,\" to make the ideas in this essay workable in my life. Each year on my birthday, I list my wants and attachments\u2014the stu that /f_its under /T_homas Aquinas's categories of money, power, pleasure, and honor. I try to be completely honest. I don't list stu I would actually hate and never choose, like a sailboat or a vacation house. Rather, I go to my weaknesses, most of which\u2014I'm embarrassed to admit\u2014involve the admiration of others for my work. /T_hen I imagine myself in /f_ive years. I am happy and at peace, living a life of purpose and meaning. I make another list of the forces that would bring me this happiness: my faith, my family, my friendships, the work I am doing that is inherently satisfying and meaningful and that serves others. Inevitably, these sources of happiness are \"intrinsic\"\u2014they come from within and revolve around love, relationships, and deep purpose. They have little to do with the admiration of strangers. I contrast them with the things on the /f_irst list, which are generally \"extrinsic\"\u2014the outside rewards associated with /T_homas's list of idols. Most research has shown that intrinsic rewards lead to far more enduring happiness than extrinsic rewards. I consider how extrinsic things compete with the intrinsic under-pinnings of my happiness for time, attention, and resources. I imagine myself sacri/f_icing my relationships for the admiration of strangers, and the result down the line in my life. With this in mind, I confront the bucket list. I reflect on each item, telling myself that while a particular desire is not evil, it won't bring me the happiness and peace I seek. Finally, I go back to the list of things that will bring me real happiness. I commit to pursuing these things. Given my itch for admiration, I have made a point of trying to pay less attention to how others perceive me, by turning away these thoughts when they emerge. I have let many relationships go that were really only about professional advancement. I work somewhat less than I did in years past. It takes conscious eort to avoid backsliding\u2014the often, and little spritzes of dopamine tempt me to return to my old ways. But my changes in behavior have mostly been permanent, and I've been happier as a result. I'm not arguing here that there's anything wrong with visiting the exotic place you've always dreamed of seeing, or running a marathon, or otherwise pushing your capabilities to do or make something di cult, professionally or otherwise. Work that feels more like a mission provides purpose; travel can be inherently valuable and enjoyable; learning a skill or meeting a challenge can bring intrinsic satisfaction; meaningful activities pursued with friends or loved ones can deepen relationships. But ask yourself whether the attraction of your bucket-list items, be they professional or experiential, derives mostly from how much they will make others admire or envy you. /T_h ese motivations will never lead to deep satisfaction. III. GET SMALLER Lately, there has been an explo-sion of books on minimalism, which all recommend downsiz-ing your life to get happier\u2014to chip away the detritus of your life. But it's not just about having less stu to weigh you down. We can, in fact, /f_i nd immense fullness when we pay attention to smaller and smaller things. /T_h e Buddhist master /T_h ich Nhat Hanh explains this in his book The Miracle of Mindfulness: \"While washing the dishes one should only be wash-ing the dishes, which means that while washing the dishes one should be completely aware of the fact that one is washing the dishes.\" Why? If we are thinking about the past or future, \"we are not alive during the time we are washing the dishes.\" For many years I had a beloved friend, someone a couple of decades my senior with whom I worked throughout my 20s. In his 40s, he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, and given six months to live. By some miracle or another, he survived those six months, and then another six, and then almost three decades more. He was never \"cured,\" however. His doctor told him the can- cer was a wolf at the door, biding its time. Sooner or later the wolf would slip in, which it ultimately did a couple of years ago. But the three decades under this cloud were not a burden. On the contrary, they reminded him every day of the gift that was the current day, and thus, to look for his satisfactions not in audacious, multiyear life goals, but in tiny, everyday moments of beauty with his beloved wife and daughter. Some years ago, a few close friends were at his home, eating and drinking out in his garden. It was dusk, and he asked us to gather around a plant with small, closed /f_l owers. \"Watch a /f_l ower,\" he instructed. We did so, for about 10 minutes, in silence. All at once, the /f_l owers popped open, which we learned that they did every evening. We gasped in amazement. It was a moment of intense satisfaction. But here's the thing I still can't get over: Unlike most of the junk on my old bucket list, that satisfaction endured. /T_h at mem-ory still brings me joy\u2014more so than many of my life's earthly \"accomplishments\"\u2014not because it was the culmination of a large goal, but because it was an unexpected gift, a tiny miracle. /T_h e prince will always skip the small satisfactions of life, forgo- ing a /f_l ower at dusk for money, power, or prestige. But the sage never makes this mistake, and I try not to either. Each day, I have an item on my to-do list that involves being truly present for an ordinary occurrence. A lot of this revolves around my religious practice as a Catholic, includ-ing daily Mass with my wife and meditative prayer. It also includes walks with no devices, listening only to the world outside. /T_h ese are truly satisfying things. /M.sc/y.sc /d.sc/a.sc/u.sc/g.sc/h.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc /w.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc o to college a few months after our talk about the science of satisfaction. After the isolation and lockdowns of COVID-19, and the sad joke that was her senior year of high school, she made a run for the border, enrolling at a university in Spain. I am bereft. We do send each other several messages every day, though. /T_h ey are almost never about work or school. Instead, we share small moments: a photo of a rainy street, a silly joke, the num-ber of push-ups she just did. I don't know whether this is giving her a head start on freeing herself from the paradox of dissat- isfaction, but it is like medicine for me. Each message is like the evening of the /f_l ower\u2014a brief glimpse of the beati/f_i c vision of heaven, perhaps\u2014bringing quiet satisfaction. Each of us can ride the waves of attachments and urges, hop- ing futilely that someday, somehow, we will get and keep that satisfaction we crave. Or we can take a shot at free will and self-mastery. It's a lifelong battle against our inner caveman. Often, he wins. But with determination and practice, we can /f_i nd respite from that chronic dissatisfaction and experience the joy that is true human freedom. Arthur C. Brooks writes /T_h e Atlantic 's \"How to Build a Life\" column and is a professor at Harvard. /T_h is essay is adapted from his new book, From Strength to Strength: Finding Success, Happiness, and Deep Purpose in the Second Half of Life . It's not just about having less stuff to weigh you down. 0322_WEL_Brooks_Satisfaction [Print]_15892097.indd 30 1/17/2022 2:33:56 PM30World-Class Programs for Middle and High School Students!

Also in Madrid and on a T all Ship too!\u00a8 years 32 clich\u00e9, almost, to note that our culture lacks the proper script for ending friendships. We have no rituals to observe, no paperwork to do, no boilerplate dialogue to crib from. Yet when Elisa Albert and Rebecca Wol were in the /f_inal throes of their friendship, they managed, entirely by accident, to leave behind just such a script. /T_he problem was that it read like an Edward Albee play\u2014tart, unsparing, /f_luorescent with rage. I met Elisa one evening in 2008, after an old friend's book reading. She was such mesmerizing company that I rushed out to buy her debut novel, /T_he Book of Dahlia, which had been pub- lished a few months earlier. I was instantly struck by how unafraid of darkness and emotional chaos she was. /T_he same articulate fury suused After Birth , her follow-up; her next book, Human Blues (her \"monster,\" as she likes to say), comes out in July. Rebecca is someone I knew only by reputation until recently. She's the founding editor of the literary magazine Fence, a haven for genre-resistant writing and writers that's now almost 25 years old. She's also the author of a novel and four poetry collections, including Manderley , selected by the National Poetry Series; she has a /f_ifth coming out in the fall. /T_he two women became close more than a decade ago, spot- ting in each other the same traits that dazzled outsiders: talent, charisma, saber-tooth smarts. To Rebecca, Elisa was \"impossibly vibrant\" in a way that only a 30-year-old can be to someone who is 41. To Elisa, Rebecca was a glamorous and reassuring role model, a woman who through some miracle of alchemy had successfully combined motherhood, marriage, and a creative life. It would be hard to overstate how much that mattered to Elisa. She was a new mother, all alone in a new city, Albany, where her husband was a tenured professor. (Albany! How does one /f_ind friends in Albany?) Yet here was Rebecca\u2014the center of a lush social network, a pollinating bee\u2014showing up on campus at Fence 's oce every day. /T_he two entered an intense loop of contact. /T_hey took a class in New York City together. /T_hey sometimes joked about run-ning away together. And, eventually, they decided to write a book together, a collection of their email and text correspondence about a topic with undeniably broad appeal: how to live in the world and be okay. /T_hey called this project /T_he Wellness Letters . I read the manuscript in one gulp. /T_heir exchanges have real swing to them, a screwball quality with a punk twist. On page 1: R: Anything you haven't done? \"Eorts at Wellness\"R: I just started writing something called T rying To Stay O My Meds ... E: U R A STRONG WOMAN. But over time, resentments /f_licker into view. Deep /f_issures in their belief systems begin to show. /T_hey start writing past each other, not hearing each other at all. By the end, the two women have taken every dicult truth they've ever learned about the other and fashioned it into a club. /T_he /f_inal paragraphs are a mess of blood and bone and gray guts. In real time, Elisa and Rebecca enact on the page something that almost all of us have gone through: the painful dissolution of a friendship. /T_he speci/f_ics of their disagreements may be unique to them, but the broad outlines have the ring and shape of the familiar; /T_he Wellness Letters are almost impossible to read without seeing the corpse of one of your own doomed friendships /f_loating by. Elisa complains about failures in reciprocity.Rebecca implies that Elisa is being insensitive, too quick to judge others. Elisa implies that Rebecca is being too self-involved, too needy.Rebecca implies: Now you're too quick to judge me. Elisa ultimately suggests that Rebecca's unhappiness is at least partly of her own unlovely making. To which Rebecca more or less replies: Who on earth would choose to be this unhappy? To which Elisa basically says: Well, should that be an excuse for being a myopic and inconsiderate friend? E: /T_he truth is that I am wary of you/uni00A0... R: When you say that you are wary of me, it reminds me of some-thing/uni00A0... oh yes, it's when I told you that I was wary of you/uni00A0... wary of your clear pattern of forming mutually idolatrous relation ships with women who you cast in a particular role in your life only to later castigate. Their feelings were too hot to contain. What started as a deliberate, thoughtful meditation about wellness ended as an in advertent chronicle of a friendship gone terribly awry. /T_he Wellness Letters, 18 months of electrifying correspondence, now sit mute on their laptops. /I.sc /f.sc/i.sc/r.sc/s.sc/t.sc /r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/d.sc /T_he Wellness Letters in December/uni00A02019, with a dierent project in mind for them. /T_he pandemic forced me to set it aside. But two years later, my mind kept returning to those 0322_WEL_Senior_Friendships [Print]_15883405.indd 34 1/17/2022 10:04:32 AM34 /three.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyleletters, for reasons that at this point have also become a clich\u00e9: I was undergoing a Great Pandemic Friendship Reckoning, along with pretty much everyone else. All of those hours in isolation had amounted to one long spin of the centri fuge, separating the thickest friendships from the thinnest; the ambient threat of death and loss made me realize that if I wanted to renew or intensify my bonds with the people I loved most, the time was now, right now. But truth be told, I'd already been mulling this subject for quite some time. When you're in middle age, which I am (mid-middle age, to be precise\u2014I'm now 52), you start to realize how very much you need your friends. /T_h ey're the /f_l ora and fauna in a life that hasn't had much diversity, because you've been so busy\u2014so relentlessly, stupidly busy\u2014with middle-age things: kids, house, spouse, or some modern-day version of Zorba's full catastrophe. /T_h en one day you look up and discover that the ambition monkey has fallen o your back; the chil-dren into whom you've pumped thousands of kilowatt-hours are no longer partial to your com-pany; your partner may or may not still be by your side. And what, then, remains? With any luck, your friends. According to Laura Carstensen, the director of the Stanford Center on Longevity, I've aged out of the friendship-collecting business, which tends to peak in the tumbleweed stage of life, when you're still young enough to spend Saturday evenings with random strangers and Sunday mornings nursing hangovers at brunch. Instead, I should be in the friendship-enjoying business, luxuriating in the relationships that survived as I put down roots. And I am luxuriating in them. But those friendships are awfully hard-won. With midlife comes a number of signi/f_i cant up heavals and changes, ones that prove too much for many friendships to withstand. By middle age, some of the dearest people in your life have gently faded away. You lose friends to marriage, to parenthood, to politics\u2014even when you share the same politics. (Political obsessions are a big, underdiscussed friendship-ender in my view, and they seem to only deepen with age.)

In 2009, the Dutch sociologist Ger- ald Mollen horst published an attention-grabber of a study that basically showed we replace half of our social network over the course of seven years, a reality we both do and don't intuit.

But we now live in an era of radical indi-vidual freedoms. All of us may begin at the same starting line as young adults, but as soon as the gun goes o , we're all running in di erent directions; there's little synchrony to our lives. We have kids at di erent rates (or not at all); we pair o at di erent rates (or not at all); we move for love, for work, for opportunity and adventure and more affordable real estate and healthier lifestyles and better weather. Yet it's precisely because of the atomized, customized nature of our lives that we rely on our friends so very much. We are recruiting them into the roles of people who once simply coexisted with us\u2014parents, aunts and uncles, cousins, fellow parishioners, fellow union members, fellow Rotarians. It's not wholly natural, this business of making our own tribes. And it hardly seems conducive to human thriving. /T_h e percent-age of Americans who say they don't have a single close friend has quadrupled since 1990, according to the Survey Center on American Life. One could argue that modern life conspires against friendship, even as it requires the bonds of friendship all the more. When I was younger, my friends had as much a hand in authoring my personality as any other force in my life. /T_h ey advised me on what to read, how to dress, where to eat. But these days, many are showing me how to think, how to live. It gets trickier as you age, living. More bad things happen.

And you're dreading the days when an older generation will no longer be there for you\u2014when you'll have to rely on another ecosystem altogether for support. Yet for the past decade or so, I've had a tacit, mutual under- standing with many of the people I love most, particularly fellow working parents: Look, life 's crazy, the o ce has loaded me up like a pack animal, we 'll catch up when we catch up, love you in the mean-time. /T_h is happens to suit a rotten tendency of mine, which is to work rather than play. I could give you all sorts of therapized rea-sons for why I do this, but honestly, at my age, it's embarrassing. /T_h ere comes a point when you have to wake up in the morning and decide that it doesn't matter how you got to whatever sorry cul-de-sac you're circling; you just have to /f_i nd a way out. I think of Nora Ephron, whose death caught virtually all of her friends by surprise. Had they known, they all said afterward\u2014had they only known that she was ill\u2014they'd have savored the din-ners they were having, and they certainly wouldn't have taken for granted that more of them would stretch forever into the future. Her sudden dis appearance from the world revealed the fragility of our bonds, and how presumptuous we all are, how careless, how naive. But shouldn't this fragility always be top of mind? Surely the pandemic has taught us that? I mean, how long can we all keep postponing dinner? /W.sc/h.sc/e.sc/n.sc /I.sc /b.sc/e.sc/g.sc/a.sc/n.sc /w.sc/r.sc/i.sc/t.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc this story, my friend Nina warned me: Do not make this an occasion to rake through your own history and beat yourself up over the state of your own friendships. Which is something that only a dear friend, armed with protective instincts and a Spidey sense about her friend's self-lacerating tenden-cies, would say. Fair enough. But it's hard to write a story about friendship in midlife without thinking about the friends you've lost. \"When friendship exists in the background, it's unremarkable but gener-ally uncomplicated,\" wrote B./uni00A0D./uni00A0McClay, an essayist and critic, in Lapham 's Quarterly last spring. \"But when friendship becomes the plot, then the only story to tell is about how the friendship ended.\" Friendship is the plot of this article. So naturally I'm going to write at least a little about those I've lost\u2014and my regrets, the choices I've made, the time I have and have not invested. On the positive side of the ledger: I am a loyal friend. I am an empathetic friend. I seldom, if ever, judge. Tell me you murdered your mother and I'll say, Gee, you must have been really mad at her. I am quick to remind my friends of their virtues, telling them that they are beautiful, they are brilliant, they are superstars. I spend money on them. I often express my love. On the negative side: I'm oversensitive to slights and minor humiliations, which means I'm wrongly inclined to see them as intentional rather than pedestrian acts of thoughtlessness, and I get easily overwhelmed, engulfed. I can almost never mentally justify answering a spontaneous phone call from a friend, and I have to force myself to phone and email them when I'm hard at work on a project. I'm that prone to monomania, and that consumed by my own tension. What both of these traits have in common is that I seem to live my life as if I'm under siege. I'm guessing my amygdala is the size of a cantaloupe. Most of my withered friendships can be chalked up to this terrible tendency of mine not to reach out. I have pals in Wash- ington, D.C., where I started my professional life, whom I haven't seen in years, and friends from college I haven't seen since practically graduation\u2014people I once adored, shared my life with, couldn't have imagined living for two seconds without. And yet I do. I have./T_h is is, mind you, how most friendships die, according to the social psychologist Beverley Fehr: not in pyrotechnics, but a quiet, gray dissolve. It's not that any-thing happens to either of you; it's just that things stop happening between you. And so you drift. It's the friendships with more deliberate endings that torment. At best, those dead friendships merely hurt; at worst, they feel like personal failures, each one amounting to a little divorce. It doesn't matter that most were undone by the hidden trip wires of midlife I talked about earlier: marriage, parenthood, life's ran- dom slings and arrows. By midlife, you've invested enough in your relationships that every loss stings. You feel bereft, for one thing. As if someone has wandered o with a piece of your history. And you fear for your reputation. Friends are the custodians of your secrets, the eyewitnesses to your weaknesses. Every confession you've made\u2014all those naked moments\u2014can be weaponized. /T_h ere was the friend I lost to parenthood, utterly, though I was also a parent. Her child shortly consumed her world, and she had many child-rearing opinions. /T_h ese changes alone I could have handled; what I couldn't handle was her obvious disapproval of my own parenting style (hands-o ) and my lack of sentimentality Her life was always fine, swell, just couldn't be better, thanks. Talking with her was like playing strip poker with someone in a down parka. JOHNANDERSONPHOTO (if you don't have something nice to say about raising kids, pull up a chair and sit next to me). /T_h ere was no operatic breakup. She moved away; I made zero e ort to stay in touch. But whenever I think of her, my stomach chirps with a kind of longing. She showed me how cognitive behavioral therapy worked before I even knew it was a thing, rightsizing my perspective each time I turned a wispy cirrus into a thunderhead. And her conversation was tops, weird and unpredictable. I miss her. Or who she was. Who we were.I lost a male friend once to parenthood too, though that situ- ation was di erent. In this instance, I was not yet a mother. But he was a dad, and on account of this, he testily informed me one day, he now had higher moral obligations in this world than to our friendship or to my feelings, which he'd just seriously hurt (over something that in hindsight I'll confess was pretty trivial). While I knew on some level that what he said was true, I couldn't quite believe he was saying it out loud, this person with whom I'd spent so many idle, gleeful hours. I miss him a lot, and wonder to this day whether I should have just let the comment go. Yet whenever I think of him, a /f_i ery asterisk still appears next to his name. Mahzad Hojjat, a social- psychology professor at the Uni-versity of Massachusetts at Dart-mouth, once told me that people may say that friendship betrayals aren't as bad as romantic betray-als if they're presented with hypo-thetical scenarios on a question-naire. But that's not how they experience friendship betrayals in real life. /T_h is doesn't surprise me. I still have sense-memories of how sickened I was when this friend told me I'd been relegated to a lower league\u2014my heart quickening, the blood thumping in my ears. /T_h en there was the friend who didn't say anything hurtful to me per se; the problem was how little she said about herself at all. According to Hojjat, failures of reciprocity are a huge theme in broken friendships. /T_h at stands to reason\u2014asymmetries of time and e ort can continue for only so long before you feel like you've lost your dignity. (I myself have been criticized for neglect and laziness, and rightly. It's shitty.) But there's a subtler kind of asymmetry that I think is far more devastating, and that is a certain lopsidedness in self-disclosure. /T_h is friend and I would have long lunches, dinners, co ees, and I'd be frank, always, about my disappointments and travails. I consider this a form of currency between women: You trade con/f_i dences, small glass fragments of yourself. But not with her. Her life was always /f_i ne, swell, just couldn't be better, thanks. Talking with her was like playing strip poker with someone in a down parka. I mentioned this problem to Hojjat. She ventured that per- haps women expect more of their female friends than men do of their male companions, given how intimate our friendships tend to be. In my small, unscienti/f_i c personal sample of friends, that's certainly true. Which brings me to the subject of our Problem Friends. Most of us have them, though we may wish we could tweeze them from our lives. (I've had one for decades, and though on some level I'll always love her, I resolved to be done with her dur-ing this pandemic\u2014I'd grown weary of her volatility, her storms of anger.) Unfortunately, what the research says about these friends is depressing: It turns out that time in their company can be worse than time spent with people we actively dislike. /T_h at, at any rate, is what the psycholo-gist Julianne Holt-Lunstad dis-covered in 2003, when she had the inspired idea to monitor her subjects' blood pressure while in the presence of friends who gen-erated con/f_l icted feelings. It went up\u2014even more than it did when her subjects were in the presence of people with whom they had \"aversive\" relationships. Didn't matter if the conversation was pleasant or not. You have to wonder whether our bodies have always known this on some level\u2014and whether the pandemic, which for a long while turned every social inter-action into a possible health risk, made all of our problem friends easier to give the slip. It's not just that they're potentially bad for you. /T_h ey are bad for you. And\u2014 alas\u2014always were. /A.sc /w.sc/o.sc/r.sc/d.sc here about the scholarship devoted to friend- ship: I know I've been citing it quite a bit, but the truth is, there's surprisingly little of it, and even less that's particularly good. A great deal is dime-store wisdom crowned in the laurels of peer review, dispatches from the Empire of the Obvious. (When I /f_i rst wrote to Elisa about this topic, she replied with an implicit eye roll. \"Lemme guess: Long term intimate relation ships are good for u!\") You have perhaps heard, for instance, of Holt-Lunstad's 2010 meta-analysis showing that a robust social network is as bene/f_i cial Friendship is a bulwark against stasis, a potential source of creativity and renewal. 0322_WEL_Senior_Friendships [Print]_15883405.indd 38 1/17/2022 10:04:36 AM38 /three.taboldstyle/nine.taboldstyleto giving up cigarettes. So yes: Relation- ships really are good for u. But friendship, generally speaking, is the redheaded stepchild of the social sciences. Romantic relationships, marriage, family\u2014 that's where the real grant money is. /T_hey're a wormy mess of ties that bind, whether by blood, sex, or law, which makes them hotter topics in every sense\u2014more seductive, more fraught. But this lacuna in the literature is also a little odd, given that most Americans have more friends than they do spouses. And one wonders if, in the near future, this gap in quality scholarship may start to /f_ill. In a book published in the summer of 2020, Big Friendship , Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman, the hosts of the podcast Call Your Girlfriend, argued that some friendships are so important that we should consider assigning them the same priority we do our romantic partnerships. /T_hey certainly view their own friend-ship this way; when the two of them went through a rough patch, they went so far as to see a therapist together. I mentioned this to Laura Carstensen. Her /f_irst reaction was one of utter bewilderment: \"But/uni00A0... it's the whole idea that friend-ships are voluntary that makes them positive.\" Practically everyone who studies friendship says this in some form or another: What makes friendship so fragile is also exactly what makes it so special. You have to continually opt in. /T_hat you choose it is what gives it its value. But as American life recon/f_igures itself, we may /f_ind our- selves rethinking whether our spouses and children are the only ones who deserve our binding commitments. When Sow and Friedman went into counseling together in their 30s, Sow was unmarried, which hardly made her unusual. According to a 2020 survey by the Pew Research Center, nearly a quarter of Ameri-can adults ages 30 to 49 are single\u2014and single here doesn't just mean unmarried; it means not dating anyone seriously. Neither woman had (or has) children, either, a fact that could of course change, but if it doesn't, Sow and Friedman would scarcely be alone. Nearly 20/uni00A0percent of American adults ages 55 to 64 have no children, and 44/uni00A0percent of current nonparents ages 18 to 49 say they think it's unlikely they ever will. \"I have been with family sociologists who think it's crazy to think that friends could replace family when you realize you're in real trouble,\" Carstensen told me. \" Yeah, they say, they'll bring you soup when you have the /f_lu, but they're unlikely to care for you when you have dementia. But we could reach a point where close friends do quit their jobs to care for you when you have dementia.\" Friendship is the rare kind of relationship that remains forever available to us as we age. It's a bulwark against stasis, a potential source of creativity and renewal in lives that otherwise narrow with time. \"I've recently built a whole community of people half my age,\" says Esther Perel, 63, the psychotherapist and host of the immensely popular podcast Where Should We Begin?, in which she conducts a one-o couples-therapy session with anonymous clients each episode. \"It's the most important shift in my life, friendship-wise. /T_hey're at my dinner table. I have three friends having babies.\" /T_hese intergenerational friendships, she told me, are one of the unexpected joys of middle age, giving her access to a new vocabulary, a new culture, a new set of mores\u2014at just the moment when the culture seems to have passed her generation by. When we spoke, Perel was also preparing for her very /f_irst couples-therapy session with two friends, suggesting that Sow and Friedman were onto something. \"/T_he pandemic has taught us the importance of mass mutual reliance,\" Perel said. \"Inter-dependence has to conquer the lonely, individualistic nature of Americans.\" As a native of Belgium, Perel has always found this aspect of American life a little baing, particularly when she was a new mother. \"In my culture, you ask a friend to babysit,\" she told me. \"Here, /f_irst you try to hire someone; then you go and 'impose.' And I thought: /T_his is warped. /T_his now? Finally? /E.sc/l.sc/i.sc/s.sc/a.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /R.sc/e.sc/b.sc/e.sc/c.sc/c.sc/a.sc nurtured each other as if they were family\u2014 and often in ways their own families did not. When they met, Elisa was a new mother, and her parents were 3,000 miles away. Rebecca became her proxy parent, coaching her through breastfeeding and keeping her company; she even smelled like Eli-sa's mom. \"I can't describe the smell, but it's YOU, and it's HER; it's no cosmetic,\" Elisa later wrote in /T_he Wellness Letters, adding, and your birthdays are adjacent and you are very much like her in some deep, meaningful ways, it seems to me. /T_here is no one I can talk to the way I can talk to her, and to you. Her intelligence is vast and curious and childlike and insatiable and transcendent, like yours. When they met, Rebecca was still married. While Rebecca's marriage was falling apart, it was Elisa who threw open her doors and gave Rebecca the run of her downstairs /f_loor, providing a refuge where she could think, agonize, crash. \"We were sort of in that thing where you're like, 'You're my savior,' \" Rebecca told me. \"Like, you cling to each other, because you've found each other.\" So what, ultimately, undid these two spit sisters?On one level, it appeared to be a signi/f_icant dierence in philosophy. Namely: how they each thought about depression. Rebecca struggles with major depression. Elisa has had experi- ences with the black dog too, going through long spells of trying to bring it to heel. But she hates this word, depression, thinks it decanted of all meaning, and in her view, we have a choice about how to respond to it. R: When I'm really depressed I feel, and therefore am, at a pain- ful remove from \"life\"/uni00A0... Even as I was aware that I was doing it all the time, this thing called \"being a human being\"/uni00A0... it was not what I imagined living to feel like. And I have spent years essentially faking it, just reassuring myself that at least from the outside I look like I'm alive/uni00A0... E: Jesus Christ, dude, /f_irst thought: you must chill. You must CHILL. /T_his is not particularly empathetic, I'm sorry. I just want to get you down on the /f_loor for a while. I want to get you breath-ing. I want to get you out of your head and into your hips, into your feet. I want to loosen you up. /T_hat is all. MARCH 2022To Elisa, women have been sold a false story about the ori- gins of their misery. Everyone talks about brain chemistry. What about trauma? Screwy families? /T_he birth-control pills she took from the time she was 15, the junk food she gorged on as a kid? E: THE BODY, dude. All I care about is THE BODY. /T_he mind is a fucking joke/uni00A0... Remind me to tell you about the time they prescribed me Zoloft in college after my brother died. Pills for grief! I am endlessly amused by this now. But pills for grief\u2014that is, in fact, exactly what Rebecca would argue she needed. Around and around the two went. /T_he way Elisa saw it, Rebecca was using her depression as an excuse for bad choices, bad behavior. What Rebecca read in Elisa's emails was a reproach, a failure to grasp her pain. \"If there's no such thing as depression,\" she wrote in /T_he Wellness Letters , \"what is this duck sitting on my head?\" It's a painfully familiar dynamic in a friendship: One friend says, Get a grip already . And the other one says, I'm trying. Can't you see I'm trying? Neither party relishes her role. Eventually, Rebecca started taking medication. And once she did, she pulled away, vanishing for weeks. Elisa had no idea where she'd gone. E: Well, our dialogue has turned into a monologue, but I am undaunted. Are you unmoved to write to me because your meds have worked so well that you're now perfectly functional, to the extent that you need not go searching for ways to narrate/make sense of your internal landscape? Weirdly, this explanation was not far o. When Rebecca even- tually did reply, the exchange did not end well. Elisa accused her of never apologizing, including for this moment. She accused Rebecca of political grandstanding in their most recent corre-spondence, rather than talking about wellness. But Elisa also confessed that perhaps Rebecca happened to be catching her on a bad day\u2014Elisa's mother had just phoned, and that call had driven her into a rage. /T_his last point gave Rebecca an opening to share something she'd clearly been wanting to say for a long time: Elisa was forever comparing her to her mother. But Elisa was also forever com-plaining about her mother, saying that she hated her mother. Her mother was, variously, \"sadistic,\" \"untrustworthy,\" and \"a monster.\" So /f_inally Rebecca said: In all the ways you've spoken about your mother, I don't recall you ever describing to me the actual things she's done, what makes you feel so destroyed by her. To which Elisa replied that this was exactly the manipulative, hurtful type of gaslighting in which her mother would indulge. It was at this moment that I, the reader, /f_inally realized: /T_his wasn't just a /f_ight over dierences in philosophy. If our friends become our substitute families, they pay for the failures of our families of origin. Elisa's was such a mess\u2014a brother long dead, parents long divorced\u2014that her unconscious eorts to re-create it were always going to be fraught. And on some level, both women knew this. Elisa said it outright. When she /f_irst wrote in /T_he Wellness Letters that Rebecca smelled like her mother, Elisa mused: What's my point? Something about mothers and children, and the unmothered, and human frailty, and imprinting. Something about friendship, which can and should provide support and understand-ing and company and a dierent sort of imprinting. A dierent sort of imprinting. /T_hat's what many of us, con- sciously or not, look for in friendships, isn't it? And in our marriages too, at least if you believe Freud? Improved versions of those who raised us? \"I have no answers about how to ensure only good relation- ships,\" Elisa concluded in one email to Rebecca. \"But I guess practice? T rial and error? Revision?\" /T_hat really is you ensure them? /B.sc/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc /i.sc/n.sc /t.sc/h.sc/e.sc /one.taboldstyle/nine.taboldstyle/eight.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyle/s.sc, the Oxford psychologists Michael Argyle and Monika Henderson wrote a seminal paper titled \"/T_he Rules of Friendship.\" Its six takeaways are obvious, but what the hell, they're worth restating: In the most stable friendships, people tend to stand up for each other in each other's absence; trust and con/f_ide in each other; support each other emotionally; oer help if it's required; try to make each other happy; and keep each other up-to-date on positive life developments. It's that last one where I'm always falling down. Keeping up contact, ideally embodied contact, though even semi-embodied contact\u2014by voice, over the phone\u2014would probably suce. Only when reading Elisa and Rebecca in atom-splitting meltdown did I realize just how crucial this habit is. /T_he two women had become theoretical to each other, the sum only of their ideas; their friend-ship had migrated almost exclusively to the page. \"/T_he writing took the place of our real-life relationship,\" Elisa told me. \"I felt like the writing was the friendship.\" In this way, Elisa and Rebecca were creating the conditions of a pandemic before there even was one. Had anyone read /T_he Wellness Letters in 2019, they could have served as a cautionary tale: Our COVID year of lost embodied contact was not good for friendship. According to a September survey by Pew, 38/uni00A0percent of Americans now say they feel less close to friends they know well. /T_he problem is that when it comes to friendship, we are ritual- de/f_icient, nearly devoid of rites that force us together. Emily Langan, a Wheaton College professor of communication, argues that we need them. Friendship anniversaries. Regular road trips. Sunday-night phone calls, annual gatherings at the same rental house, whatever it takes. \"We're not in the habit of elevating the practices of friendship,\" she says. \"But they should be similar to what we do for other relationships.\" When I consider the people I know with the greatest talent for friendship, I realize that they do just this. /T_hey make contact a priority. /T_hey jump in their cars. /T_hey appear at regular inter-vals in my inbox. One told me she clicks open her address book TATIANA TEREKHINA / 2022 /four.taboldstyle/two.taboldstyleevery now and then just to check which friends she hasn't seen in a while\u2014and then immediately makes a date to get together. Laura Carstensen told me during our chat that good friends are for many people a key source of \"unconditional positive regard,\" a phrase I keep turning over and over in my mind. (Not hers, I should note\u2014the term was popularized in the 1950s, to describe the ideal therapist-patient relationship. Carstensen had the good sense to repurpose it.) Her observation perfectly echoed something that Benjamin Taylor, the author of the lovely memoir Here We Are, said to me when I asked about his close friendship with Philip Roth. What, I wanted to know, made their relationship work? He thought for so long that I assumed the line had gone dead. \"Philip made me feel that my best self was my real self,\" he /f_inally said. \"I think that's what happens when friendships succeed. /T_he person is giving back to you the feelings you wish you could give to yourself. And seeing the person you wish to be in the world.\" I'm not the sampler-making sort. But if I were, I'd sew these words onto one. /P.sc/e.sc/r.sc/h.sc/a.sc/p.sc/s.sc /t.sc/h.sc/e.sc /b.sc/e.sc/s.sc/t.sc /b.sc/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc about friendship I've read is /T_he Undoing Project, by Michael Lewis. /T_hat might be a strange thing to say, because the book is not, on its face, about friendship at all, but about the birth of behavioral economics. Yet at its heart is the story of an exceptionally complicated relationship between two giants of the /f_ield. Amos Tversky was a bualo of charisma and con/f_idence; Daniel Kahneman was a sparrow of anxiety and neuroticism. /T_he early years of their collaboration, spent at Hebrew University in the late 1960s, were giddy and all-consuming, almost like love. But as their fame grew, a rivalry developed between them, with Tversky ultimately emerging as the better-known of the two men. He was the one who got invited to fancy conferences\u2014without Kahneman. He was the one who got the MacArthur genius grant\u2014not Kahneman. When Kahne-man told Tversky that Harvard had asked him to join its faculty, Tversky blurted out, \"It's me they want.\" (He was at Stanford at the time; Kahneman, the University of British Columbia.) \"I am very much in his shadow in a way that is not represen- tative of our interaction,\" Kahneman told the psychiatrist Miles Shore, who interviewed him and Tversky for a project on creative pairs. \"It induces a certain strain. /T_here is envy! It's just disturb-ing. I hate the feeling of envy.\" Whenever I mentioned to people that I was working on a story about friendship in midlife, questions about envy invariably followed. It's an irresistible subject, this thing that Socrates called \"the ulcer of the soul.\" Paul Bloom, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, told me that many years ago, he taught a seminar at Yale about the seven deadly sins. \"Envy,\" he said dryly, \"was the one sin students never boasted about.\" He's right. With the exception of envy, all of the deadly sins can be pleasurable in some way. Rage can be righteous; lust can be thrilling; greed gets you all the good toys. But nothing feels good about envy, nor is there any clear way to slake it. You can work out anger with boxing gloves, sate your gluttony by feasting on a cake, boast your way through cocktail hour, or sleep your way through lunch. But envy\u2014what are you to do with that?Die of it, as the expression goes. No one ever says they're dying of pride or sloth. Yet social science has surprisingly little to say about envy in friendship. For that, you need to consult artists, writers, musicians. Gore Vidal complained, \"Every time a friend succeeds, something inside me dies\"; Morrissey sang \"We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful.\" Envy is a ubiquitous theme in literature, spi-dering its way into characters as wide-ranging as Len\u00f9 and Lila, in Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan novels, and pretty much every malevo-lent neurotic ever conjured by Martin Amis (the apotheosis being Richard T ull, the failed novelist and minor critic of /T_he Information , who smacks his son when his rival lands on the best-seller list). In the spring 2021 issue of /T_he Yale Review, Jean Garnett, an editor at Little, Brown, wrote a terri/f_ic essay about envy and identical twinship that feels just as applicable to friendship. My favorite line, bar none: \"I can be a very generous sister\u2014maternal, even\u2014as long as I am winning.\" With those 15 words, she exposes an uncomfortable truth. Many of our relationships are predicated on subtle dierences in power. Rebalance the scales, and it's anyone's guess if our fragile egos survive. Underneath envy, Garnett notes, is the secret wish to shift those weights back in our favor, which really means the shameful wish to destroy what others have. Or as Vidal also (more or less) said: \"It is not enough to succeed; a friend must also fail.\" At this point, pretty much everyone I know has been kicked in the head in some way. We've all got our satchel of disappoint-ments to lug around. But I did feel envy fairly acutely when I was younger\u2014 especially when it came to my girlfriends' appearances and self-con/f_idence. One friend in particular /f_illed me with dread every time I introduced her to a boyfriend. She's a knockout, turns heads everywhere; she both totally knows this and doesn't have a clue. I have vivid memories of wandering a museum with her one afternoon and watching men silently trail her, /f_inding all dopey manner of excuses to chat her up. My tendency in such situations is to turn my role into shtick\u2014 I'm the wisecracking Daria, the mordant brunette, the one whose qualities will age well. I hated pretending I was above it all. What made this situation survivable was that this friend was\u2014and still is\u2014forever telling me how great I look, even though it's perfectly apparent in any given situation that she's Prada and I'm the knock-o on the street vendor's blanket. Whatever. She means it when she tells me I look great. I love her for saying it, and saying it repeatedly. In recent years, I have had one friend I could have badly envied. He was my oce spouse for almost two decades\u2014the other half of a two-headed vaudeville act now a quarter century old. We bounced every story idea o each other, edited each other, took our book leaves at the same time. /T_hen I got a new job and he went o to work on his second book, which he phoned to tell me one day had been selected by/uni00A0... Oprah. \"You're kidding!\" I said. \"/T_hat's fucking amazing.\"Which, of course, it was. /T_his wasn't a lie.But in the cramped quarters of my ego, crudely bound together with bubble gum and Popsicle sticks, was it all that fucking amazing? 0322_WEL_Senior_Friendships [Print]_15883405.indd y, to die. Here's the thing: I don't allow myself too many silly, Walter Mitty-like fantasies of glory. I'm a pessimist by nature, and any-way, fame has never been my endgame in life. But I did kinda sorta secretly hope to one day be interviewed from Oprah Winfrey's yoga nook. /T_h at our friendship hummed along in spite of this bolt of for- tune and success in his life had absolutely nothing to do with me and everything to do with him, for the simple reason that he con-tinued to be his vulnerable self. (It turns out that lucky, success ful people still have problems, just di erent ones.) It helped that he never lost sight of my own strengths, either, even if I felt inadequate for a while by comparison. One day, while he was busy crushing it, I glumly confessed that I was miserable in my new job. /T_h en go be awesome somewhere else, he said, as if awesomeness were some essential property of mine, how you'd de/f_i ne me if I were a metal or a stone. I think I started to cry. It helped, too, that my friend genuinely deserved to be on Oprah . (His name is Bob Kolker, by the way; his book is Hidden Valley Road, and everyone should read it, because it is truly a mar-vel.) It's the almost-ness of envy that kills, as Garnett points out in her essay\u2014the fact that it could have or should have been us. She quotes Aristotle's Rheto- ric : \"We envy those who are near us in time, place, age, or reputa-tion/uni00A0... those whose possession of or success in a thing is a reproach to us: these are our neighbors and equals; for it is clear that it is our own fault we have missed the good thing in question.\" And I have no clue what I would have done if Bob hadn't handled his success with humil-ity and tact. If he'd become mon-strously boastful\u2014or, okay, even just a little bit complacent\u2014 I honestly think I wouldn't have been able to cope. Adam Smith noted how essential this restraint is in /T_h e /T_h eory of Moral Senti- ments. If a suddenly successful person has any judgment, he wrote, that man will be highly attuned to his friends' envy, \"and instead of appearing to be elated with his good fortune, he endeavours, as much as he can, to smother his joy, and keep down that elevation of mind with which his new circumstances naturally inspire him.\" /T_h is is, ultimately, what Amos Tversky failed to do with Daniel Kahneman, according to /T_h e Undoing Project. Worse, in fact: Tver- sky refused to address the imbalance in their relationship, which never should have existed in the /f_i rst place. Kahneman tried, at /f_i rst, to be philosophical about it. \"/T_h e spoils of academic success, such as they are\u2014eventually one person gets all of it, or gets a lot of it,\" he told Shore, the psychiatrist studying creative pairs. \"/T_h at's an unkindness built in. Tversky cannot control this, though I wonder whether he does as much to control it as he should.\" But Kahneman wasn't wondering, obviously. /T_h is was an accusa- tion masquerading as a suspicion. In hindsight, the decisive moment in their friendship\u2014what marked the beginning of the end\u2014came when the two were invited to deliver a couple of lectures at the Uni-versity of Michigan. At that point, they were working at separate institutions and collaborating far less frequently; the theory they presented that day was one almost entirely of Kahneman's devis-ing. But the two men still jointly presented it, as was their custom. After their presentation, Tversky's old mentor approached them both and asked, with genuine awe, where all those ideas came from. It was the perfect opportunity for Tversky to credit Kahneman\u2014to right the scales, to correct the balance, to pull his friend out from his shadow and brie/f_l y into the sun. Yet Tversky didn't. \"Danny and I don't talk about these things\" was all he said, according to Lewis. And with that, the reader realizes: Kahneman's second-class status\u2014 in both his own imagina-tion and the public's\u2014was prob-ably essential to the way Tversky conceived of their partnership. At the very least, it was something Tversky seemed to feel zero need to correct. Kahneman continued to col- laborate with Tversky. But he also took pains to distance him-self from this man, with whom he'd once shared a typewriter in a small o ce in Jerusalem. /T_h e ill feelings wouldn't ease up until Tversky told Kahneman he was dying of cancer in 1996. /S.sc/o.sc /n.sc/o.sc/w.sc /I.sc'/m.sc /b.sc/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc to think- ing about Nora Ephron's friends, mourning all those dinners they never had. It's the dying that does it, always. I started here; I end here (we all end here). It is amazing how the death of someone you love exposes this lie you tell yourself, that there'll always be time. You can go months or even years without speaking to a dear old friend and feel /f_i ne about it, blundering along, living your life. But discover that this same friend is dead, and it's devastating, even though your day-to-day life hasn't changed one iota. You're rudely reminded that this is a capricious, disordered cosmos we live in, one that suddenly has a friend-size hole in it, the air now puckered where this person used to be. Last spring, an old friend of my friend David died by suicide. David had had no clue his friend was su ering. When David It is amazing how the death of someone you love exposes this lie you tell yourself, that there'll always be time. 0322_WEL_Senior_Friendships [Print]_15883405.indd 43 1/17/2022 10:04:39 man, September/uni00A02020, he'd seemed more or less /f_i ne. January/uni00A06 had wound him up more than David's other friends\u2014he'd fulminate volcanically about the insurrection over the phone, practically burying David under mounds of words\u2014but David certainly never interpreted this irritating development as a sign of despair. But David did notice one curious thing. Before the 2020 election, he had bet this friend $10,000 that Donald T rump would win. David isn't rich, but he /f_i gured the move was the ultimate hedge\u2014if he won, at least he got 10 grand, and if he lost, hey, great, no more T rump. On November/uni00A07, when it became o cial\u2014 no more T rump!\u2014David kept waiting for a phone call. It never came. He tried provoking his friend, send-ing him a check for only $15.99, pointing out that they'd never agreed on a payment schedule. His friend wrote back a sharp rebuke, saying the bet was serious. David sent him a check for $10,000. His friend wordlessly cashed it.David was stunned. No gloat- ing phone call? Not even a gleeful email, a crowing text? /T_h is was a guy who loved winning a good bet. Nothing. A few months later, he was found dead in a hotel. /T_h e suicide became a kind of reckoning for David, as it would for anyone. Because he's a well-adjusted, positive sort of fellow, he put his grief to what seemed like constructive use: He wrote an old friend from high school, once his closest friend, the only one who knew exactly how weird their adolescence was. David was blunt with this friend, telling him in his email that a good friend of his had just died by suicide, and there was nothing he could do about it, but he could reach out to those who were still alive, those he'd lost track of, people like him. Would he like to catch up sometime? And reminisce? David never heard back. Distraught, he contacted someone the two men had in common. It turns out his friend's life hadn't worked out the way he'd wanted it to. He didn't have a partner or kids; his job wasn't one he was proud of; he lived in a back water town. Even though David had made it clear he just wanted to talk about the old days, this man, for whatever reason, couldn't bring himself to pick up the phone. At which point David was contending with two friendship deaths\u2014one literal, the other metaphorical. \"You know what I realized?\" he said to me. \"At this age, if your romantic life is settled\"\u2014 and David's is\u2014\"it's your friends who break your heart.

By a certain age, you /f_i nd the optimal perspective on them, ide- ally, just as you do with so many of life's other disappointments. If the heartbreak of midlife is realizing what you've lost\u2014that sad inventory of dusty shelves\u2014then the revelation is discovering that you can, with e ort, get on with it and start enjoying what you have. /T_h e psychoanalyst Erik Erikson made a point of emphasizing this idea in his stages of psychosocial develop ment. /T_h e last one, \"integrity versus despair,\" is all about \"the acceptance of one's one and only life cycle and of the people who have become signi/f_i cant to it as something that had to be.\" An awfully tidy formulation, admittedly, and easier said than done. But worth striving for nonetheless. Elisa recently wrote to me that what she misses about Rebecca is \"the third thing that came from the two of us. the alchemy of our minds and hearts and (dare i say?) souls in conversation. what she brought out in me and what i brought out in her, and how those things don't exist without our relation ship.\" And maybe this is what many creative partnerships look like\u2014 volatile, thrilling, supercharged. Some can't withstand the inten-sity, and self-destruct. It's what happened to Kahneman and Tversky. It's famously what hap-pens to many bands before they dissolve. It's what happened to Elisa and Rebecca. Elisa hopes to now make art of that third thing. To write about it. Rebecca remains close in her mind, if far away in real life. Of course, as Elisa points out (with a hat-tip to Audre Lorde), all deep friendships generate something outside of themselves, some special and totally other third thing. Whether that thing can be sustained over time becomes the question. /T_h e more hours you've put into this chaotic business of living, the more you crave a quieter, more nurturing third thing, I think. /T_h is needn't mean dull. /T_h e friends I have now, who've come all this distance, who are part of my aging plan, include all kinds of joy-ous goofballs and originals. /T_h ere's loads of open country between enervation and intoxication.

When someone later criticized me on T witter, I suppressed my rage and tried to sym-pathize with my hater. /T_hen, to loosen up and expand my social skills, I headed to an improv class. I was midway through an experiment\u2014sample size: 1\u2014to see whether I could change my personality. Because these activities were supposed to make me happier, I approached them with the desperate hope of a supplicant kneeling at a shrine. Psychologists say that personality is made up of /f_ive traits: extroversion, or how sociable you are; conscientiousness, or how self-disciplined and organized you are; agreeableness, or how warm and empathetic you are; openness, or how receptive you are to new ideas and activities; and neuroticism, or how depressed or anxious you are. People tend to be happier and healthier when they score higher on the /f_irst four traits and lower on neuroticism. I'm pretty open and conscientious, but I'm low on extroversion, middling on agreeableness, and o the charts on neuroticism. Researching the science of personality, I learned that it was possible to deliberately mold these /f_ive traits, to an extent, by adopting certain behaviors. I began wondering whether the tactics of personality change could work on me. I've never really liked my personality, and other people don't like it either. In grad school, a partner and I were assigned to write fake obituaries for each other by interviewing our families and friends. /T_he nicest thing my partner could shake out of my loved ones was that I \"really enjoy grocery shopping.\" Recently, a friend named me maid of honor in her wedding; on the web-site for the event, she described me as \"strongly opinionated and /f_iercely persistent.\" Not wrong, but not what I want on my tombstone. I've always been bad at parties because the topics I bring up are too depressing, such as everything that's wrong with my life, and everything that's wrong with the world, and the futility of doing anything about either. Neurotic people, twitchy and suspicious, can often \"detect things that less sensitive people simply don't register,\" writes the personality psychologist Brian Little in Who Are You, Really? \"/T_his is not conducive to relaxed and easy living.\" Rather than being motivated by rewards, neurotic people tend to fear risks and punish ments; we ruminate on negative events more than emo-tionally stable people do. Many, like me, spend a lot of money on therapy and brain medications. And while there's nothing wrong with being an introvert, we tend to underestimate how much we'd enjoy behaving like extro-verts. People have the most friends they will ever have at age 25, and I am much older than that and never had very many friends to begin with. Besides, my editors wanted me to see if I could change my personality, and I'll try anything once. (I'm open to experiences!) Maybe I, too, could become a friendly extrovert who doesn't carry around emergency Xanax. I gave myself three months. /T.sc/h.sc/e.sc /b.sc/e.sc/s.sc/t.sc-/k.sc/n.sc/o.sc/w.sc/n.sc /e.sc/x.sc/p.sc/e.sc/r.sc/t.sc on personality change is Brent Roberts, a psychologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Our interview in June felt, to me, a bit like visiting an evidence-based spiritual guru\u2014he had a Zoom background of the red rocks of Sedona and the answers to all my big questions. Roberts has published dozens of studies showing that person ality can change in many ways over time, challenging the notion that our traits are \"set like plaster,\" as the psychologist William James put it in 1887. But other psychologists still sometimes tell Roberts that they simply don't believe it. /T_here is a \"deep-seated desire on the part of many people to think of personality as unchang-ing,\" he told me. \"It simpli/f_ies your world in a way that's quite nice.\" Because then you don't have to take responsibility for what you're like. Don't get too excited: Personality typically remains fairly stable throughout your life, especially in relation to other people. If you were the most outgoing of your friends in college, you will probably still be the bubbliest among them in your 30s. But our temperaments tend to shift naturally over the years. We change a bit during adolescence and a lot during our early 20s, and con-tinue to evolve into late adulthood. Generally, people grow less neurotic and more agreeable and conscientious with age, a trend sometimes referred to as the \"maturity principle.\" Longitudinal research suggests that careless, sullen teenagers can transform into gregarious seniors who are sticklers for the rules. One study of people born in Scotland in the mid-1930s\u2014which admittedly had some methodological issues\u2014found no correlation between participants' conscientiousness at ages 14 and 77. A later study by Rodica Damian, a psychologist at the Uni-versity of Houston, and her colleagues assessed the personalities of a group of American high-school students in 1960 and again 50 years later. /T_hey found that 98/uni00A0percent of the participants had changed at least one personality trait.

With a little work, you can nudge your personality in a more positive direction. Several studies have found that people can mean-ingfully change their personalities, sometimes within a few weeks, by behaving like the sort of person they want to be. Students who put more e ort into their homework became more conscientious. In a 2017 meta-analysis of 207 studies, Roberts and others found that a month of therapy could reduce neuroticism by about half the amount it would typically decline over a person's life. Even a change as minor as taking up puzzles can have an e ect: One study found that senior citizens who played brain games and completed crossword and sudoku puzzles became more open to experiences. /T_h ough most personality-change studies have tracked people for only a few months or a year afterward, the changes seem to stick for at least that long. When researchers ask, people typically say they want the success- oriented traits: to become more extroverted, more conscientious, and less neurotic. Roberts was sur-prised that I wanted to become more agreeable. Lots of people think they're too agreeable, he told me. /T_h ey feel they've become doormats. Toward the end of our conver- sation, I asked Roberts whether there's anything he would change about his own personality. He admitted that he's not always very detail-oriented (a.k.a./uni00A0conscien-tious). He also regretted the anxiety (a.k.a./uni00A0neuroticism) he experienced early in his career. Grad school was a \"disconcerting experience,\" he said: /T_h e son of a Marine and an artist, he felt that his classmates were all \"brilliant and smart\" and understood the world of academia better than he did. I was struck by how similar his story sounded to my own. My parents are from the Soviet Union and barely understand my career in journalism. I went to crappy public schools and a little-known college. I've notched every minor career achievement through night sweats and meticulous emails and aching computer shoulders. Neuroticism had kept my inner /f_i re burning, but now it was su ocating me with its smoke. /T.sc/o.sc /b.sc/e.sc/g.sc/i.sc/n.sc /m.sc/y.sc /t.sc/r.sc/a.sc/n.sc/s.sc/f.sc/o.sc/r.sc/m.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc, I called Nathan Hudson, a psychology professor at Southern Methodist University who created a tool to help people alter their personality. For a 2019 paper, Hudson and three other psychologists devised a list of \"challenges\" for students who wanted to change their traits. For, say, increased extroversion, a challenge would be to \"introduce yourself to someone new.\" /T_h ose who completed the challenges experienced changes in their personality over the course of the 15-week study, Hudson found. \"Faking it until you make it seems to be a viable strategy for personality change,\" he told me. But before I could tinker with my personality, I needed to /f_i nd out exactly what that personality consisted of. So I logged on to a website Hudson had created and took a personality test, answer-ing dozens of questions about whether I liked poetry and parties, whether I acted \"wild and crazy,\" whether I worked hard. \"I radiate joy\" got a \"strongly disagree.\" I disagreed that \"we should be tough on crime\" and that I \"try not to think about the needy.\" I had to agree, but not strongly, that \"I believe that I am better than others.\" I scored in the 23rd percentile on extroversion\u2014\"very low,\" especially when it came to being friendly or cheerful. Meanwhile, I scored \"very high\" on conscientiousness and openness and \"aver-age\" on agreeableness, my high level of sympathy for other people making up for my low level of trust in them. Finally, I came to the source of half my breakups, 90/uni00A0percent of my therapy appoint-ments, and most of my problems in general: neuroticism. I'm in the 94th percentile\u2014\"extremely high.\" I prescribed myself the same challenges that Hudson had given his students. To become more extro-verted, I would meet new people. To decrease neuroticism, I would meditate often and make gratitude lists. To increase agreeableness, the challenges included sending supportive texts and cards, think-ing more positively about people who frustrate me, and, regrettably, hugging. In addition to complet-ing Hudson's challenges, I decided to sign up for improv in hopes of increasing my extroversion and reducing my social anxiety. To cut down on how pissed off I am in general, and because I'm an over- achiever, I also signed up for an anger-management class. Hudson's findings on the mutability of personality seem to endorse the ancient Buddhist idea of \"no-self\"\u2014no core \"you.\" To believe other wise, the sutras say, is a source of su er-ing. Similarly, Brian Little writes that people can have \"multiple authenticities\"\u2014 that you can sincerely be a di erent person in di erent situations. He proposes that people have the ability to temporarily act out of character by adopting \"free traits,\" often in the service of an important personal or professional project. If a shy introvert longs to schmooze the bosses at the o ce holiday party, they can grab a canap\u00e9 and make the rounds. /T_h e more you do this, Little says, the easier it gets. Staring at my test results, I told myself, /T_h is will be fun! After all, I had changed my personality before. In high school, I was shy, studious, and, for a while, deeply religious. In college, I was I've never really liked my personality, and other people don't like it either. 0322_WEL_Khazan_Personality [Print]_15884113.indd 49 1/14/2022 5:25:20 PM basically hermetic \"pressure addict,\" as one former editor put it. It was time for yet another me to make her debut. Ideally, in the end I would be happy, relaxed, personable. /T_h e screams of angry sources, the failure of my boyfriend to do the tiniest fucking thing\u2014they would be nothing to me. I would /f_i nally understand what my therapist means when she says I should \"just observe my thoughts and let them pass without judgment.\" I made a list of the challenges and attached them to my nightstand, because I'm very conscientious. /I.sc/m.sc/m.sc/e.sc/d.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/e.sc/l.sc/y.sc /I.sc /e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/e.sc/d.sc /a.sc /p.sc/r.sc/o.sc/b.sc/l.sc/e.sc/m.sc: I don't like improv. It's basically a Quaker meeting in which a bunch of o ce workers sit quietly in a circle until someone jumps up, points toward a corner of the room, and says, \"I think I found my kan-garoo!\" My vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" When I told my boyfriend what I was up to, he said, \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey.\" I was also scared out of my mind. I hate looking silly, and that's all improv is. /T_h e /f_i rst night, we met in someone's townhouse in Washington, D.C., in a room that was, for no discernible reason, deco-rated with dozens of elephant sculp-tures. Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I began hoping that someone would grab one and knock me unconscious. /T_h at didn't happen, so instead I played a game called Zip Zap Zop, which involved making lots of eye contact while tossing around an imaginary ball of energy, with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who works on Capitol Hill. /T_h en we pretended to be traveling salespeople peddling sulfuric acid. If someone had walked in on us, they would have thought we were insane. And yet I didn't hate it. I decided I could think of being funny and spontaneous as a kind of intellectual challenge. Still, when I got home, I unwound by drinking one of those single-serving wines meant for petite female alcoholics. A few days later, I logged in to my first Zoom anger- management class. Christian Jarrett, a neuroscientist and the author of Be Who You Want, writes that spending quality time with people who are dissimilar to you increases agreeableness. And the people in my anger-management class did seem pretty di erent from me. Among other things, I was the only person who wasn't court-ordered to be there. We took turns sharing how anger has a ected our lives. I said it makes my relationship worse\u2014less like a romantic partnership and more like a toxic workplace. Other people worried that their anger was hurting their family. One guy shared that he didn't understand why we were talking about our feelings when kids in China and Russia were learning to make weapons, which I deemed an interesting point, because you're not allowed to criti-cize others in anger management. /T_h e sessions\u2014I went to six\u2014mostly involved reading worksheets together, which was tedious, but I did learn a few things. Anger is driven by expectations. If you think you're going to be in an anger-inducing situation, one instructor said, try drinking a cold can of Coke, which may stimulate your vagus nerve and calm you down. A few weeks in, I had a rough day, my boyfriend gave me some stupid suggestions, and I yelled at him. /T_h en he said I'm just like my dad, which made me yell more. When I shared this in anger manage-ment, the instructors said I should be clearer about what I need from him when I'm in a bad mood\u2014which is listening, not advice. All the while, I had been working on my neuroticism, which involved making a lot of gratitude lists. Sometimes it came natu-rally. As I drove around my little town one morning, I thought about how grateful I was for my boyfriend, and how lonely I had been before I met him, even in other relationships. Is this gratitude? I wondered. Am I doing it? /W.sc/h.sc/a.sc/t.sc /i.sc/s.sc /p.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/o.sc/n.sc/a.sc/l.sc/i.sc/t.sc/y.sc, any- way, and where does it come from? Contrary to conventional wis- dom about bossy firstborns and peacemaking middles, birth order doesn't in/f_l uence personality. Nor do our parents shape us like lumps of clay. If they did, siblings would have similar dispositions, when they often have no more in com-mon than strangers chosen o the street. Our friends do in/f_l uence us, though, so one way to become more extroverted is to befriend some extroverts. Your life circumstances also have an e ect: Getting rich can make you less agreeable, but so can growing up poor with high levels of lead exposure. A common estimate is that about 30 to 50 percent of the di erences between two people's personalities are attributable to their genes. But just because something is genetic doesn't mean it's permanent. /T_h ose genes interact with one another in ways that can change how they behave, says Kathryn Paige Harden, a behavioral geneticist at the University of Texas. /T_h ey also inter-act with your environment in ways that can change how you behave. For example: Happy people smile more, so people react more positively to them, which makes them even more agreeable. Open-minded adventure seekers are more likely to go to college, where they grow even more open-minded. Harden told me about an experiment in which mice that were genetically similar and reared in the same conditions were moved into a big cage where they could play with one another. Over Happy people smile more, so people react more positively to them, which makes them even more agreeable. 0322_WEL_Khazan_Personality [Print]_15884113.indd 50 1/14/2022 5:25:21 PM50 /five.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyletime, these very similar mice developed dramatically dierent personalities. Some became fearful, others sociable and domi-nant. Living in Mouseville, the mice carved out their own ways of being, and people do that too. \"We can think of personality as a learning process,\" Harden said. \"We learn to be people who interact with our social environments in a certain way.\" /T_his more /f_luid understanding of personality is a departure from earlier theories. A 1914 best seller called /T_he Eugenic Marriage (which is exactly as oensive as it sounds) argued that it is not pos-sible to change a child's personality \"one particle after conception takes place.\" In the 1920s, the psycho analyst Carl Jung posited that the world consists of dierent \"types\" of people\u2014thinkers and feelers, introverts and extroverts. (Even Jung cautioned, though, that \"there is no such thing as a pure extravert or a pure introvert. Such a man would be in the lunatic asylum.\") Jung's rubric cap-tured the attention of a mother-daughter duo, Katharine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers, neither of whom had any formal scienti/f_ic training. As Merve Emre describes in /T_he Personality Brokers, the pair seized on Jung's ideas to develop that staple of Career Day, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. But the test is virtually meaningless. Most people aren't ENTJs or ISFPs; they fall between categories. Over the years, poor parenting has been a popular scapegoat for bad personalities. Alfred Adler, a prominent turn-of-the-20th-century psychologist, blamed mothers, writing that \"wherever the mother-child relationship is unsatisfactory, we usually /f_ind certain social defects in the children.\" A few scholars attributed the rise of Nazism to strict German parenting that produced hate-ful people who worshipped power and authority. But maybe any nation could have embraced a Hitler: It turns out that the aver-age personalities of dierent countries are fairly similar. Still, the belief that parents are to blame persists, so much so that Roberts closes the course he teaches at the University of Illinois by asking students to forgive their moms and dads for whatever personality traits they believe were instilled or inherited. Not until the 1950s did researchers acknowledge people's versatility\u2014 that we can reveal new faces and bury others. \"Everyone is always and everywhere, more or less consciously, playing a role,\" the sociologist Robert Ezra Park wrote in 1950. \"It is in these roles that we know each other; it is in these roles that we know ourselves.\" Around this time, a psychologist named George Kelly began prescribing speci/f_ic \"roles\" for his patients to play. Awkward wall-/f_lowers might go socialize in nightclubs, for example. Kelly's was a rhapsodic view of change; at one point he wrote that \"all of us would be better o if we set out to be something other than what we are.\" Judging by the reams of self-help literature published each year, this is one of the few philosophies all Americans can get behind. /A.sc/b.sc/o.sc/u.sc/t.sc /s.sc/i.sc/x.sc /w.sc/e.sc/e.sc/k.sc/s.sc /i.sc/n.sc, my adventures in extroversion were going better than I'd anticipated. Intent on talking to strangers at my friend's wedding, I approached a group of women and told them the story of how my boyfriend and I had met\u2014I moved into his former room in a group house\u2014which they deemed the \"story of the night.\" On the winds of that success, I tried to talk to more strangers, but soon encountered the common wedding problem of Too Drunk to Talk to People Who Don't Know Me. For more advice on becoming an extrovert, I reached out to Jessica Pan, a writer in London and the author of the book Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want to Come. Pan was an extreme introvert, someone who would walk into parties and immediately walk out again. At the start of the book, she resolved to become an extrovert. She ran up to strangers and asked them embarrassing questions. She did improv and stand-up comedy. She went to Budapest and made a friend. Folks, she networked. In the process, Pan \"/f_lung open the doors\" to her life, she writes. \"Having the ability to morph, to change, to try on free traits, to expand or contract at will, oers me an incredible feel-ing of freedom and a source of hope.\" Pan told me that she didn't quite become a hard-core extrovert, but that she would now describe herself as a \"gregarious introvert.\" She still craves alone time, but she's more willing to talk to strangers and give speeches. \"I will be anxious, but I can do it,\" she said. I asked her for advice on making new friends, and she told me something a \"friendship mentor\" once told her: \"Make the /f_irst move, and make the second move, too.\" /T_hat means you some-times have to ask a friend target out twice in a row\u2014a strategy I had thought was gauche. I practiced by trying to befriend some female journalists I admired but had been too intimidated to get to know. I messaged someone who seemed cool based on her writing, and we arranged a casual beers thing. But on the night we were supposed to get together, her power went out, trapping her car in her garage. Instead, I caught up with an old friend by phone, and we had one of those conversations you can have only with some-one you've known for years, about how the people who are the worst remain the worst, and how all of your issues remain intractable, but good on you for sticking with it. By the end of our talk, I was high on agreeable feelings. \"Love you, bye!\" I said as I hung up. \"LOL,\" she texted. \"Did you mean to say 'I this new Olga? /F.sc/o.sc/r.sc /m.sc/y.sc /g.sc/r.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/t.sc/u.sc/d.sc/e.sc /j.sc/o.sc/u.sc/r.sc/n.sc/a.sc/l.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc, I purchased a notebook whose cover said, \"Gimme those bright sunshiney vibes.\" I soon noticed, though, that my gratitude lists were repetitive odes to creature comforts and entertainment: Net/f_lix, yoga, TikTok, leg-gings, wine. After I cut my /f_inger cooking, I expressed gratitude for the dictation software that let me write without using my hands, but then my /f_inger healed. \"Very hard to come up with new things to say,\" I wrote one day. I /f_ind expressing gratitude unnatural, because Russians believe doing so will provoke the evil eye; our God doesn't like too much bragging. /T_he writer Gretchen Rubin hit a similar wall when keeping a gratitude journal for her book /T_he Happiness Project. \"It had started to feel forced and aected,\" she wrote, making her annoyed rather than grateful. I was also supposed to be meditating, but I couldn't. On almost every page, my journal reads, \"Meditating sucks!\" I tried a guided meditation that involved breathing with a heavy book on my stomach\u2014I chose Nabokov's Letters to V\u00e9ra\u2014only to /f_ind that it's really hard to breathe with a heavy book on your stomach. 0322_WEL_Khazan_Personality [Print]_15884113.indd 51 1/14/2022 5:25:22 PM /five.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyleMARCH 2022 /five.taboldstyle/two.taboldstyleI tweeted about my meditation failures, and Dan Harris, a former Good Morning America weekend anchor, replied: \"/T_he fact that you're noticing the thoughts/obsessions is proof that you are doing it correctly!\" I picked up Harris's book 10% Happier , which chronicles his journey from a high-strung reporter who had a panic attack on air to a high-strung reporter who meditates a lot. At one point, he was meditating for two hours a day. When I called Harris, he said that it's normal for meditation to feel like \"training your mind to not be a pack of wild squirrels all the time.\" Very few people actually clear their minds when they're meditating. /T_he point is to focus on your breath for however long you can\u2014even if it's just a second\u2014before you get distracted. /T_hen do it over and over again. Occasionally, when Harris meditates, he still \"rehearses some grand, expletive-/f_illed speech I'm gonna deliver to someone who's wronged me.\" But now he can return to his breath more quickly, or just laugh o the obsessing. Harris suggested that I try loving-kindness meditation, in which you beam aectionate thoughts toward yourself and others. /T_his, he said, \"sets o what I call a gooey upward spiral where, as your inner weather gets balmier, your relationships get better.\" In his book, Harris describes meditating on his 2-year-old niece. As he thought about her \"little feet\" and \"sweet face with her mischievous eyes,\" he started crying uncontrollably. What a pussy, I thought.I downloaded Harris's meditation app and pulled up a loving- kindness session by the meditation teacher Sharon Salzberg. She had me repeat calming phrases like \"May you be safe\" and \"May you live with ease.\" /T_hen she asked me to envision myself sur-rounded by a circle of people who love me, radiating kindness toward me. I pictured my family, my boyfriend, my friends, my former professors, emitting bene/f_icence from their bellies like Care Bears. \"You're good; you're okay,\" I imagined them saying. Before I knew what was happening, I had broken into sobs. /A.sc/f.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc /t.sc/w.sc/o.sc /b.sc/r.sc/u.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc /y.sc/e.sc/a.sc/r.sc/s.sc, people may be wondering if sur- viving a pandemic has at least improved their personality, making them kinder and less likely to sweat the small stu. \"Post- traumatic growth,\" or the idea that stressful events can make us better people, is the subject of one particularly cheery branch of psychology. Some big events do seem to transform personality: People grow more conscientious when they start a job they like, and they become less neurotic when they enter a romantic relation ship. But in general, it's not the event that changes your personality; it's the way you experience it. And the evidence that people grow as a result of dif-/f_iculty is mixed. Studies of post- traumatic growth are tainted by the fact that people like to say they got something out of their trauma. It's a nice thing to believe about yourself\u2014 that, pummeled by misfortune, you've emerged stronger than ever. But these studies are mostly /f_inding that people prefer to look on the bright side. In more rigorous studies, evidence of a transformative eect fades. Damian, the University of Houston psychologist, gave hun-dreds of students at the university a personality test a few months after Hurricane Harvey hit, in November/uni00A02017, and repeated the test a year later. /T_he hurricane was devastating: Many students had to leave their homes; others lacked food, water, or medical care for weeks. Damian found that her participants hadn't grown, and they hadn't shriveled. Overall they stayed the same. Other research shows that dicult times prompt us to fall back on tried-and-true behaviors and traits, not experiment with new ones. Growth is also a strange thing to ask of the traumatized. It's like turning to a wounded person and demanding, \"Well, why didn't you grow, you lazy son of a bitch?\" Roberts said. Just sur-viving should be enough. It may be impossible to know how the pandemic will change us on average, because there is no \"average.\" Some people have struggled to keep their jobs while caring for children; some have lost their jobs; some have lost loved ones. Others have sat at home and ordered takeout. /T_he pandemic probably hasn't changed you if the pandemic itself hasn't felt like that much of a change. /I.sc /b.sc/l.sc/e.sc/w.sc /o.sc/f.sc/f.sc anger management one week to go see Kesha in concert. I justi/f_ied it because the concert was a group activity, plus she makes me happy. /T_he next time the class gathered, we talked about forgiveness, which Child Weapons Guy was not big on. He said that rather than forgive his enemies, he wanted to invite them onto a bridge and light the bridge on /f_ire. I thought he should get credit for being honest\u2014who hasn't wanted to light all their enemies on /f_ire?\u2014but the anger-management instructors started to look a little angry themselves. In the next session, Child Weapons Guy seemed contrite, say- ing he realized that he uses his anger to deal with life, which was a bigger breakthrough than anyone expected. I was also praised, for an unusually tranquil trip home to see my parents, which my instructors said was an example of good \"expectation management.\" Meanwhile, my social life was slowly blooming. A T witter acquaintance invited me and a few other strangers to a whiskey tasting, and I said yes even though I don't like whiskey or strang-ers. At the bar, I made some normal-person small talk before hav-ing two sips of alcohol and wheeling the conversation around to my personal topic of interest: whether I should have a baby. /T_he woman who organized the tasting, a self- proclaimed extrovert, said people are always grateful to her for getting everyone to socialize. At /f_irst, no one wants to come, but people are always happy they did. I thought perhaps whiskey could be my \"thing,\" and, to tick o another challenge from Hudson's list, decided to go to a whiskey bar on my own one night and talk to strangers. I bravely steered my Toyota to a sad little mixed-use development and pulled up a stool at the bar. I asked the bartender how long it had taken him to memorize all the whiskeys on the menu. \"T wo months,\" he said, and turned back to peeling oranges. I asked the woman sit-ting next to me how she liked her appetizer. \"It's good!\" she said. /T_his is awful! I thought. I texted my boyfriend to come meet me. /T_he larger threat on my horizon was the improv showcase\u2014a free performance for friends and family and whoever happened to jog past Picnic Grove No./uni00A01 in Rock Creek Park. /T_he night before, I kept jolting awake from intense, improv-themed night-mares. I spent the day grimly watching old Upright Citizens Brigade shows on YouT ube. \"I'm nervous on your behalf,\" my boyfriend said when he saw me clutching a throw pillow like a life preserver. DEVIN CHRISTOPHER an improv show is to unnecessarily punish the reader, but it went fairly well. Along with crushing anxiety, my brain courses with an immigrant kid's overwhelming desire to do whatever people want in exchange for their approval. I improvised like they were giving out good SAT scores at the end. On the drive home, my boyfriend said, \"Now that I've seen you do it, I don't really know why I thought it's something you wouldn't do.\" I didn't know either. I vaguely remembered past boyfriends telling me that I'm insecure, that I'm not funny. But why had I been trying to prove them right? Surviving improv made me feel like I could survive anything, as bratty as that must sound to all my ancestors who survived the siege of Leningrad. /F.sc/i.sc/n.sc/a.sc/l.sc/l.sc/y.sc, /t.sc/h.sc/e.sc /d.sc/a.sc/y.sc came to retest my personality and see how much I'd changed. I thought I felt hints of a mild metamor-phosis. I was meditating regularly, and had had several enjoyable get-togethers with people I wanted to befriend. And because I was writing them down, I had to admit that positive things did, in fact, hap-pen to me. But I wanted hard data. /T_h is time, the test told me that my extroversion had increased, going from the 23rd percentile to the 33rd. My neuroti-cism decreased from \"extremely high\" to merely \"very the 77th my well, it dropped, from \"about average\" to \"low.\" I told Brian Little how I'd done. He said I likely did experience a \"modest shift\" in extroversion and neuroticism, but also that I might have simply triggered positive feed-back loops. I got out more, so I enjoyed more things, so I went to more things, and so forth. Why didn't I become more agree- able, though? I had spent months dwelling on the goodness of people, devoted hours to anger management, and even sent an e-card to my mom. Little speculated that maybe by behaving so di er-ently, I had heightened my internal sense that people aren't to be trusted. Or I might have subconsciously bucked against all the syrupy gratitude time. /T_h at I had tried so hard and made nega-tive progress\u2014 \"I think it's a bit of a hoot,\" he said. Perhaps it's a relief that I'm not a completely new person. Little says that engaging in \"free trait\" behavior\u2014acting outside your nature\u2014for too long can be harmful, because you can start to feel like you are suppressing your true self. You end up feeling burned out or cynical. /T_h e key may not be in swinging permanently to the other side of the personality scale, but in balancing between extremes, or in adjusting your personality depending on the situation. \"/T_h e thing that makes a personality trait maladaptive is not being high or low on something; it's more like rigidity across situations,\" Harden, the behavioral geneticist, told me. \"So it's okay to be a little bitchy in your heart, as long as you can turn it o ?\" I asked her. \"People who say they're never bitchy in their heart are lying,\" she said. Susan Cain, the author of Quiet and the world's most famous introvert, seems reluctant to endorse the idea that introverts should try to be more outgoing. Over the phone, she wondered why I wanted to be more extroverted in the /f_i rst place. Society often urges people to conform to the qualities extolled in performance reviews\u2014punctual, chipper, gregarious. But there are upsides to being introspective, skeptical, and even a little neurotic. She said it's possible that I didn't change my underlying introversion, that I just acquired new skills. She thought I could probably maintain this new personality, so long as I kept doing the tasks that got me here. Hudson cautioned that personality scores can bounce around a bit from moment to moment; to be certain of my results, I ideally would have taken the test a number of times. Still, I felt sure that some change had taken place. A few weeks later, I wrote an article that made people on T witter really mad. /T_h is happens to me once or twice a year, and I usually su er a minor internal apocalypse. I /f_i ght the people on T witter while crying, call my editor while crying, and Google How to become an actuary while cry-ing. This time, I was stressed and angry, but I just waited it out. This kind of modest improve- ment, I realized, is the goal of so much self-help material. Hours a day of meditation made Harris only 10/uni00A0percent happier. My therapist is always suggesting ways for me to \"go from a 10 to a nine on anxiety.\" Some anti depressants make people feel only slightly less depressed, yet they take the drugs for years. Perhaps the real weakness of the \"change your personality\" proposition is that it implies incremental change isn't real change. But being slightly di erent is still being di erent\u2014 the same you but with better armor. /T_h e late psychologist Carl Rogers once wrote, \"When I accept myself just as I am, then I can change,\" and this is roughly where I've landed. Maybe I'm just an anxious little introvert who makes an e ort to be less so. I can learn to meditate; I can talk to strang-ers; I can be the mouse who frolics through Mouseville, even if I never become the alpha. I learned to play the role of a calm, extroverted softy, and in doing so I got to know myself.

Donald Trump cut a deal with the T aliban that left the future of the Afghan government, Afghan women, and al-Qaeda to fate. By then most Americans were barely aware that the war was still going on. It fell to Joe Biden to complete the task. \u00b6 On April/uni00A013, 2021, the day before Biden was to address the country about Afghanistan, a 33-year-old Marine Corps veteran named Alex McCoy received a call from a White House speech-writer named Carlyn Reichel.

But the withdrawal of the last several thousand American troops would begin on that date, in the hope that the Tali-ban would not resume attacks, and it would end by Sep-tember/uni00A011, the 20th anniversary of the day the war began. On April 14, Biden, speaking from the White House, raised his hands and declared, \"It's time to end the forever war.\" /T_he withdrawal, he said, would not be \"a hasty rush to the exit. We'll do it responsibly, deliberately, and safely.\" /T_he president ended his speech, as he often does, with the invo-cation \"May God protect our troops.\" /T_hen he went to pay his respects at Section/uni00A060 of Arlington National Cemetery, where many of the dead from the 9/11 wars are buried. Afterward, Ron Klain, Biden's chief of staff, said, \"When someone writes a book about this war, it's going to begin on September/uni00A011, 2001, and it's going to end on the day Joe Biden said, 'We're coming home.' \" With /f_irm resolve, Biden had done the hard thing. /T_he rest would be logistics, while the administration turned its attention to domestic infrastructure. Alex McCoy framed the front page of the next day's New York Times and hung it on the wall of his Harlem apartment. But the war wasn't over\u2014not for Afghans, not even for some Americans. A week after Biden's speech, a group of refugee advocates\u2014 many of them veterans of the 9/11 wars\u2014released a report on the dire situation of the thousands of Afghans who'd worked at great risk for the United States during its two decades in their country. In 2009, Con-gress had created the Special Immigrant Visa to honor the service of quali/f_ied Afghans by bringing them to safety in the U.S. But the SIV program set up so many procedural hurdles\u2014Form/uni00A0DS-230, Form/uni00A0I-360, a recommendation from a supervisor with an unknown email address, a letter of employment veri/f_ication from a long-defunct military contractor, a statement describing threats\u2014that combat interpreters and oce assistants in a poor and chaotic war zone couldn't possibly hope to clear them all without the expert help of immigration lawyers, who themselves had trouble getting answers. /T_he program, chronically under-staed and clogged with bureaucratic choke points across multiple agencies, seemed designed to reject people. Year after year, administrations of both parties failed to grant even half the number of visas allowed by Congress\u2014and sometimes granted far less\u2014or to meet its requirement that cases be decided within nine months. By 2019, the average wait time for an applicant was at least four years. Toward the end of 2019, Representative Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, visited the U.S. embassy in Kabul and found a skeletal sta working on visas only part-time. \"/T_his was no accident, by the way,\" Crow told me. \"/T_his was a long-term Stephen Miller project to destroy the SIV pro-gram and basically shut it o.\" Miller, the anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim T rump adviser, along with allies throughout the executive branch, added so many new requirements that amid the pandemic the program nearly came to a halt. By the time Biden gave his speech, at least 18,000 desperate Afghans and tens of thousands of family members stood in a line that was barely moving. Many feared that the Ameri-cans would now leave without them. Najeeb Monawari had been waiting for his visa for more than a decade. He was born in 1985, the oldest son among 10 children of a bus-mechanic father and a mother who devoted herself to keeping them alive amid the lethal hazards of Kabul. He grew up in a neighborhood turned to apocalyptic rubble by the civil war of the early 1990s. He and his friends took turns walking point along mined streets on their way to swim in the Kabul River. During the Taliban's rule, his family was under constant threat because of their origins in the Panjshir Valley, the last base of the Northern Alliance resistance. With the arrival of the Americans in 2001, power /f_lipped and Panjshiris became the top dogs. \"We were the winners, and Panjshir Valley people were misusing their power,\" Monawari told me, \"driving cars wildly in the road, beating people. We were the king of the city.\" In 2006, barely 20, Monawari lied to his parents about his destination and traveled to Kandahar, the Pashtun heart-land of the Taliban, where he signed on with a military contractor as an interpreter for Canadian forces. \"I spoke three English words and no Pashto,\" he said. But his work ethic made him so popular that, after a year with the Cana-dians, Monawari was snatched away by U.S. Army Green Berets. He spent much of the next four years as a member of 12-man teams going out on nonstop combat missions in Afghanistan's most dangerous provinces.

On missions he carried a gun and used it, came under /f_ire\u2014he was wounded twice\u2014and rescued other team members, just like the Americans. He wore his beard full and his hair shaved close like them; he tried to walk like them, bulk up like them, even think like them. In pictures he is indistinguishable from the Green Berets. /T_he violence of the missions\u2014and the fear and hatred he saw in the eyes of local elders\u2014sometimes troubled him, and as a Panjshiri and a combat interpreter, he carried an automatic death sentence if he ever fell into the hands of the Taliban. But he was proud to help give Pashtun girls the right to attend school. In 2009, when a team leader told Monawari about the SIV program, he applied and collected glowing letters of recommendation from commanding ocers. He wanted to become an American citizen, join the U.S. military, and come back to Afghanistan as a Green Beret. \"/T_his was totally the plan,\" he told me. \"I was dreaming to go to America, to hold the /f_lag in a picture.\" Monawari's application disappeared into the nether- world of the Departments of State and Homeland Security, where it languished for the next decade. He checked the embassy website /f_ive times a day. He sent dozens of docu-ments by military air to the immigration service center in Nebraska, but never received clear answers. His medical exam kept expiring as his case stalled, so he had to bor-row money to take it again and again. \"We have reviewed the State Department records and con/f_irm that your SIV case is still pending administrative processing in order to verify your quali/f_ications for this visa,\" he was told in 2016. In January 2019, Monawari was summoned for an interview\u2014his third\u2014at the embassy in Kabul. By then he had gone to work for Doctors Without Borders as a logisti-cian, managing warehouses and supply chains. /T_he carnage of /f_ighting had traumatized him\u2014he found it impossible to be alone\u2014and he liked the gentle, unsel/f_ish spirit of the humanitarians. He rose through the organization to overseas positions in Sierra Leone, Lebanon, and /f_inally a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh. He /f_lew back to Afghanistan for the interview at the embassy and found himself faced with a consular ocer who had been angered by the previous applicant. When it was Monawari's turn, she almost shouted her questions, and other Afghans in the room could hear the details of his case. \"Can you calm down?\" he asked her. \"Oh, am I too loud?\" The interview was brief and unfriendly. In April, Monawari received a notice from the Depart- ment of Homeland Security, headed \"Intent to Revoke\": \"It was con/f_irmed by Mission Essential Personnel that you failed multiple polygraphs and background investigations.\" Monawari had taken regular polygraphs with the Green Berets, and a few times they had come back inconclusive before he ultimately passed. He wrote to explain this to DHS, though he didn't know what long-lost evidence he could submit to prove it. \"It is very sad, I have been waiting more than 8 years to move to a safe place (USA),\" Monawari wrote. \"Please be fair with me I was wounded twice in the mission and I worked very hard for US special force to save their life please check all my recommendation letters (attached) don't leave me behind :(\" A month later, a second notice arrived: \"The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has determined that you worked as a In the Special Forces, Najeeb Monawari found his identity. \"I was dreaming to go to America, to hold the flag in a picture.\" 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 59 1/17/2022 5:27:11 PM /five.taboldstyle/nine.taboldstyle/six.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyleMARCH 2022 procurement manager and not as a translator/ interpreter.\" To limit immigration, the T rump administration had restricted SIVs mostly to interpreters. Monawari had served for three years as a combat interpreter with the Green Berets, but his /f_inal year as a procurement manager was used to disqualify him. To deny him a visa, the U.S. government erased all his shared sacri/f_ice with Americans who might not have survived in Afghanistan without him. He would have to try again from zero. /T_he subject is almost too unbearable for Monawari to discuss. \"When I received the revocation\u2014denied for nine years, 10 years\u2014it's so painful,\" he said. \"SIV is like a giant, a monster, something scary. /T_here is no justice in this world. /T_here is no justice, and I have to accept that.\" By 2019 his beard was going white, though he was only 34. He attributes every aged hair to the Special Immigrant Visa. /I.sc/n.sc /O.sc/c.sc/t.sc/o.sc/b.sc/e.sc/r.sc /two.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyle/two.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyle, Kim Staffieri, an SIV advocate with the Association of Wartime Allies, phoned her friend Matt Zeller, a former CIA ocer and Army major. Zeller had made the cause of America's Afghan allies his full-time passion as a means to atone for an air strike in Afghanistan in 2008 that had killed 30 women and children, for which he felt some responsibility. His frenetic work on the issue had made him so sick with ulcers that he'd had to step away in 2019. Staeri was calling to get him back on the /f_ield. \"Matt, it doesn't matter who wins the election; we're leaving next year,\" she said. \"/T_he SIV program is broken, and we don't have enough time to get them all out. We're going to need to evacuate.\" Zeller proposed that they draft a white paper with ideas for the next administration. /T_hey wrote it over the holidays. /T_heir recommendations included the mass evacuation of SIV applicants to safety in a U.S. territory, such as Guam, while their cases were processed. /T_he \"Guam option\" had two successful precedents: Opera-tion New Life, in 1975, which evacuated 130,000 South Vietnamese to Guam when their country fell to North Vietnam; and Operation Paci/f_ic Haven, in 1996, when the U.S. brought 6,600 Kurds facing extermination by the army of Saddam Hussein out of northern Iraq. Staeri and Zeller were /f_inishing their white paper as President Biden took oce. /T_hree of Zeller's friends occupied key positions in the administration, and on Feb-ruary/uni00A09 he sent them copies. T wo of them\u2014one a good friend of Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser\u2014never replied. /T_he third promised to bring the proposals to a top aide of the newly con/f_irmed secretary of state, Antony Blinken. But nothing came of it./T_he report was published on April/uni00A021 by the T ruman Center for National Policy, Human Rights First, and Vet-erans for American Ideals. /T_he ties between these organiza-tions and the new administration were nearly incestuous. Blinken, a longtime supporter of refugees, had been vice chair of the board of Human Rights First; Sullivan had served on the T ruman board, as had his top deputy, Jon Finer. A former correspondent with /T_he Washington Post, Finer had helped start an organization called the Iraqi (later Inter national) Refugee Assistance Project in 2008, while he was in law school. IRAP had become the leading legal-assistance group for SIV applicants. Samantha Power, the author of \"A Problem From Hell\": America and the Age of Genocide, had sat on IRAP's board; she was the new head of the U.S. Agency for Inter national Development. /T_he highest level of the Biden administration was staed with a humanitarian dream team\u2014the best people to make Afghan allies a top priority. /T_he outside advocates drew on their personal relation- ships with insiders to lobby for urgent action. \"By every back channel available, we let people know,\" Mike Breen, the chief executive of Human Rights First, and an Army veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, told me. Breen was a co-founder of IRAP in law school with Finer. \"/T_he Guam option has been in the ether for a long time. It's something that we talked about a lot.\" Many of the advocates were in favor of ending the war. With the sand now running out, they made their case for early evacuations on moral and strategic grounds. If, on the way out of Afghanistan, America broke its promises to people at great risk of revenge killings, its already battered international reputation would be further damaged. Such a failure would also injure the morale of American troops, who were now staring at a lost war, and whose code of honor depended on leaving no one behind. /T_he advocates omitted one person from their calcula- tions: the president. But Biden's history in this area should have troubled them. On April 14, 1975, as North Vietnamese divisions raced toward Saigon, the 32-year-old /f_irst-term senator from Dela-ware was summoned to the White House. President Gerald Ford pleaded with him and other senators for funding to evacuate Vietnamese allies. Biden refused. \"I feel put-upon,\" he said. He would vote for money to bring out the remaining Americans, but not one dollar for the locals. On April/uni00A023, as South Vietnam's collapse accelerated, Biden repeated the point on the Senate /f_loor. \"I do not believe the United States has an obligation, moral or otherwise, to evacuate foreign nationals\" other than diplomats, he said. /T_hat was the job of 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 60 1/17/2022 5:27:12 PM60 /six.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyleTHE BETRAYAL B Y G E O R G E P A C K E R private organizations. \"/T_he United States has no obligation to evacuate one, or 100,001, South Vietnamese.\" This episode did not define Biden's career in for- eign aairs\u2014he went on to build a long record of inter-nationalism. In the 1990s he pressed for U.S. military intervention in Bosnia during its genocidal civil war. In the winter of 2002, after the fall of the Taliban, he went to Kabul and found himself confronted by a young girl who stood straight up at her desk in an un/f_inished schoolroom with a single light bulb and no heat. \"You cannot leave,\" she told the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"I promise I'll come back,\" Biden said.\"You cannot leave,\" the girl repeated. \"/T_hey will not deny me learning to read. I will read, and I will be a doctor like my mother. I will. America must stay.\" Biden recalled the encounter for me in an interview the following year. He interpreted the girl's words to mean: \"Don't fuck with me, Jack. You got me in here. You said you were going to help me. You better not leave me now.\" It was, he said, a \"catalytic event for me,\" and upon his return to Washington he proposed spending $20/uni00A0million on 1,000 new Afghan schools\u2014modest nation-building. But there was little interest from either the White House or Congress. When I interviewed Biden again in 2006, the disaster of the Iraq War and the persistence of corruption and violence in Afghanistan were turning him against armed humanitarianism. At a dinner in Kabul in 2008, when President Hamid Karzai refused to admit to any corrup-tion, Biden threw down his napkin and walked out. He was /f_inished with Afghanistan. In late 2010, Richard Holbrooke, Obama's envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, came into Vice President Biden's oce to talk about the situation of Afghan women. Accord-ing to an audio diary Holbrooke kept, Biden insisted, \"I am not sending my boy back there to risk his life on behalf of women's rights.\" (Biden's son Beau, a member of the Delaware National Guard, had recently been deployed to Iraq for a year.) He wanted every American troop out of Afghanistan, regardless of the consequences for women or anyone else. When Holbrooke asked about the obligation to people who had trusted the U.S. government, Biden said, \"Fuck that, we don't have to worry about that. We did it in Vietnam; Nixon and Kissinger got away with it.\" During the 2020 campaign, an interviewer repeated some of these quotes to Biden and asked if he believed he would bear responsibility for harm to Afghan women after a troop withdrawal and the return of the Taliban. Biden bristled and his eyes narrowed. \"No, I don't!\" he snapped, and put his thumb and index /f_inger together. \"Zero responsibility.\"Human rights alone were not grounds for commit- ting American troops\u2014it was a solid argument, based on national interest. But it didn't explain the hardness, the combativeness. Questions about Afghanistan and its people made Biden rear up and dig in. During the 2020 campaign he was seen as deeply empathetic, but the /f_ierce attachments of \"Middle-Class Joe\" are parochial. /T_hey come from per-sonal ties, not universal concerns: his family, his hometown, his longtime advisers, his country, its troops. /T_he Green Beret interpreter and the girl in the un/f_inished schoolroom now stood outside the circle of empathy. II. \"TRAITORS\" On January 20, 2021, an Afghan named Khan was waiting to celebrate the inauguration of President Biden when he received news he'd been awaiting for three years: His SIV application had cleared an important step, approval from the U.S. embassy. (For his family's safety, I'm not using his full name.) Khan, a 30-year-old employee of a U.S. mili-tary contractor, lived in a village in southeastern Afghani-stan with his wife, their 2-year-old son, a dog, two cats, and extended family in a house next to an orchard of almond and apple trees. He had received three death threats from the Taliban and survived three suicide bombings and four armed assaults that had killed scores of people. /T_he T rump years had been disastrous for SIV applicants like Khan. Ten minutes after receiving the longed-for email, he was thrilled to watch the swearing-in of the new American president. Mina, Khan's 22-year-old wife, who was pregnant with their second child, had 10 family members work-ing for the Americans. /T_his was unusual for a family of Pashtuns, and dangerous in a region where the Taliban controlled much of the countryside. Her sister's husband, Mohammad, had worked for several years at the U.S. embassy and was now employed in the same military 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 61 1/17/2022 5:27:12 PM /six.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyle/six.taboldstyle/two.taboldstyleMARCH 2022 THE ATLANTIC oce as Khan. Mohammad had been waiting on his SIV application for 10 years. /T_he previous October, Taliban insurgents had killed his uncle, nephew, and cousin at a wedding ceremony where they had intended to kill him. On January/uni00A027, Mohammad was driving to the oce with his 10-year-old son when a Toyota Corolla blocked his way. From behind a low concrete wall two gunmen opened /f_ire. Mohammad managed to drive 50/uni00A0feet before a stream of bullets cut him down. When his wife heard the news, she ran a mile barefoot to the hospital, but by the time she got there Mohammad was dead. /T_heir son stopped speaking for a week. When he was /f_inally able to describe the attack, he repeated the words that the Talibs had yelled: \"Where are the Ameri-can forces to save you? Where are their helicopters? Where are their airplanes? You're an in/f_idel, a traitor! You helped them for a decade! Where are they now?\" If not for an errand in Kabul, Khan would have been in the car with his brother-in-law. He started working from home, and he and Mina left his village and moved between rented houses in the provincial capital. /T_hey took shifts on the roof day and night to keep watch for strangers who might try to plant an explosive in the yard. In the spring, the Taliban closed in on the city. One night in May, Khan's dog barked incessantly, and the next morning Khan found a note at his back gate. It said: \"You have been helping U.S. occupier forces, and you have been providing them with intelligence information. You are an ally and spy of in/f_idels. We will never leave you alive and will not have mercy on your family, because they are supporting you. Your destiny will be like your brother-in-law's.\" He went around to check the front gate. A grenade was wired to the bolt, set to explode when the gate was opened. Khan and Mina moved to another rented house. In June, Talibs raided his family home in the village. /T_hey expelled Khan's parents and siblings, smashed windows, destroyed furniture, stole Mina's jewelry and Khan's car, and burned all of his books. /S.sc/I.sc/V.sc /a.sc/p.sc/p.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc/a.sc/n.sc/t.sc/s.sc and their families numbered about 80,000 people. But after 20 years, far more Afghans than these had put themselves in danger by joining the American proj-ect in their country: rights activists, humanitarian workers, journalists, judges, students and teachers at American- backed universities, special-forces commandos. A full accounting would reach the hundreds of thousands. Many of them were women, and most were under 40\u2014the generation of Afghans who came of age in the time of the Americans. /T_he U.S. and its international partners had failed to achieve most of their goals in Afghanistan. /T_he Afghan government and armed forces remained criminally weak, hollowed out by corruption and tribalism; violence kept increasing; the Taliban were taking district after district. But something of value\u2014always fragile and dependent on foreigners\u2014 had been accomplished. \"We created a situation that enabled the Afghans to change their own society,\" Mark Jacobson, an Army veteran and former civilian adviser to U.S. commanders in Afghanistan, told me. \"We created a situation that enabled the Afghans to nation-build.\" After the U.S. and the Taliban signed their agree- ment in Doha in February/uni00A02020, attacks against Ameri-can troops stopped\u2014but hundreds of Afghans in civil society, especially women, were targeted in a terrifying campaign of assassinations that shattered what was left of public trust in the Afghan government and seemed to show what lay in store after the Americans left. Carter \"Where are the American forces to save you? Where are their helicopters? Where are their airplanes? You're an infidel, a traitor! You helped them for a decade! 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 62 1/17/2022 5:27:13 PM62 /six.taboldstyle/three.taboldstyleTHE BETRAYAL B Y G E O R G E P A C K E R Malkasian, the author of /T_he American War in Afghani- stan, who worked for years as a civilian adviser to the U.S. military and later spoke with Taliban negotiators during the peace talks, told me they never expressed any mercy toward Afghans who'd worked with the Americans: \"/T_he Taliban have always been very lenient toward the killing and execution of people they consider spies.\" In a restored Islamic Emirate, everyone's fate would be up to the Taliban. Not just to the political leaders in Doha and Kabul, but to local gunmen in remote provinces with no media around, carrying out the will of God, settling scores, or just enjoying themselves. Some Afghans would be marked for certain death. Many others would face the destruction of their hopes and dreams. No law required the U.S. government to save a single one\u2014only a moral debt did. But just as ordinary Talibs could act on their own to punish \"traitors,\" so could ordinary Americans try on their own to help their friends. A U.S. Army captain I will call Alice Spence knew a group of Afghan women who were especially en dangered. (Because she is still active-duty military, she asked for anonymity.) Spence, from a nonmilitary family in New England, had attended an Ivy League college. At 27, in the summer of 2014, she quit her job at an accounting /f_irm and joined the Army. /T_he recruiter warned that she wouldn't get very far\u2014she was too old and barely made the minimum weight requirement (her wrists and biceps were about the same size). But Spence became an ocer and deployed to Afghanistan, where she trained Afghan units called Female Tactical Platoons. FTPs were attached to Special Operations Forces and went on missions with male commandos\u2014American and Afghan men and women /f_lying on the same helicopters, humping heavy kits up the same mountains, the women joining the men on violent night raids against Taliban or Islamic State targets. /T_he main job of the female troops was to search and question local women and children, but they also /f_ired their weapons and were /f_ired upon. /T_he FTPs were particularly hated by the Taliban for being elite troops, for being women, and for being overwhelmingly Hazara\u2014the Shiite minority that the Taliban continually targeted with suicide bombings and assassinations. Hawa, a young Hazara woman from Bamiyan, in the center of the country, joined the army at age 18, in 2015. She loved watching war movies, and when military recruit-ers visited her high school she was drawn to the uniforms, the weapons, the bravery, the chance to serve her country. (I am using only her /f_irst name for her family's safety.) Hawa's parents vigorously opposed her choice\u2014the army was too dangerous for their daughter. But she was deter-mined. \"It doesn't matter if you say no,\" Hawa told them. \"You will see when I go there.\" Lieutenant Hawa met Captain Spence at Bagram Air Base. \"Oh my God, you're an FTP?\" Spence asked her, In July, the Taliban conquered the home district of Wazir Nazary, a 40-year-old Afghan woman. Taliban assail-ants broke into her home and shot her in the face, wounding both eyes. VICTOR J.

How did you get into the mili- tary?\" Hawa replied that Spence looked like a skeleton and gave her the call sign Eskelet ; Spence's for Hawa was T arbooz , for the watermelon she loved to eat at the base's dining facility. Spence formed a close bond with Hawa and another FTP member named Mahjabin. /T_he women exchanged language lessons, and Spence learned a variety of jokes and vulgarities in Dari. /T_hey worked out together, shared mid-night meals, and fell into hysterics over whoopee cushions. The Afghan women saw the war with the fatalism of hard experience. /T_hey expected no /f_inal victory, only a long, perhaps permanent struggle to hold on to the gains for which they'd sacri/f_iced so much. \"I truly loved, admired, and respected them,\" Spence told me. \"/T_here's very few bonds that exist on this Earth like those between people who walk towards death together.\" After the Doha agreement, American Special Forces stopped going on missions against the Taliban with the Afghans. In the summer of 2020, Spence, now stationed in Hawaii, got a message from Hawa. Talibs had told the imam of the Shiite mosque in her family's Kabul neighbor-hood that they would kill any local Hazara soldiers they might later /f_ind if he didn't give up their names now. Hawa asked for Spence's help to get out of Afghanistan. Spence put together an SIV application, but it was rejected\u2014as a member of the Afghan National Army, Hawa lacked a letter from a U.S. employer. After Biden declared the end of the war in April, Spence began to panic. \"Hawa my friend are you still in Afghani-stan?\" she wrote in June. \"I need to get you out somehow. I will try.\" \"Please talk to a lawyer tell him/her how you can help me to get to the USA,\" Hawa replied. \"I know it is dicult but I need you to go out. Here is very dangerous for me now I need your help dear. I will compensation when I come to there.\" \"No compensation, you are my azizam,\" Spence wrote\u2014\"my dear.\" Spence and a few other female soldiers collected a list of FTPs in need of visas. /T_hey wrote their own employment-veri/f_ication letters on Army letterhead. With Mahjabin's help, they tracked down elusive birth dates, regularized spellings of Afghan names, and gathered details about threats. \"T wo months ago, the Taliban made three big explosions in the school nearest my house,\" Hawa wrote in her statement. \"My younger sister was there, but sur-vived. Many of her classmates died in the attack.\" (/T_he bombings killed at least 90 people, most of them Hazara schoolgirls.) \"She is very scared and cannot go to school anymore. /T_hey also killed my cousin in the explosion. I know they will kill me too if they /f_ind me.\" Spence and her colleagues assembled packets of docu- ments and fed them into the sluggish gears of the bureau-cracy as the last American troops left Afghanistan. III. \"OPTICS\" On April 21, one week after Biden's speech, 16 members of the House of Representatives\u201410 Democrats and six Republicans, led by Jason Crow and Seth Moulton, a Mas-sachusetts Democrat\u2014announced the formation of the Honoring Our Promises Working Group. Its purpose was to oer bipartisan support for bringing Afghan allies to safety. \"/T_he goal was: Let's not let politics get wrapped up in this,\" Peter Meijer, a Michigan Republican and an Iraq War veteran, told me. \" 'Honor our promises! /T_his shouldn't be that hard' was the sentiment that many of us had.\" /T_he next day, April/uni00A022, General Kenneth F ./uni00A0McKenzie/uni00A0Jr. of Central Command armed that the military, if so ordered, would be able to bring Afghans out of harm's way as it withdrew. At the White House, Jon Finer, the deputy national secu- rity adviser, held meetings on Afghanistan with the No./uni00A02 ocials from relevant agencies at least once a week. /T_he subject of SIVs was also discussed at meetings of Cabinet principals led by Jake Sullivan. /T_hese discussions focused largely on ways to improve the visa program\u2014adding sta in Kabul and Washington, identifying choke points, speed-ing up processing. But bringing all the SIV applicants to safety would still take at least two years. And it would leave tens or hundreds of thousands of other Afghans, who had American aliations but were ineligible for the visas, with no hope of getting out. Advocates pressed the administra-tion to create a new program that would give these Afghans priority access as refugees to the U.S. 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 64 1/17/2022 5:27:14 PM64 /six.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyleTHE BETRAYAL B Y G E O R G E P A C K E R It was too late to rely on /f_ixing a broken bureaucracy. A catastrophe was coming. But April turned to May, Ameri- can troops began to leave Afghanistan, and still the fate of endangered Afghans remained unclear. \"Studying a problem for too long is an excuse to do nothing,\" Becca Heller, a co-founder of IRAP who is now its executive director, told me. \"You don't study a problem in an emergency.\" IRAP and other groups created an unusual coalition of veteran, humanitarian, and religious organizations called Evacuate Our Allies. /T_hey were given meetings with mid-level White House ocials who listened and took notes, saying little. At one meeting, when an advocate mentioned that some NATO allies were already bringing Afghans to their countries, an ocial suddenly perked up: \"Which countries are willing to take people?\" The official had misunderstood\u2014the allies were taking their own Afghan partners, not America's. By late May, American troops were leaving Afghanistan so quickly that the last ones\u2014except for a force of about 1,000 to protect the embassy and the airport\u2014would be out by early July, far sooner than Biden's September/uni00A011 deadline. /T_he pace caught the administration's top policy makers by surprise. \"Speed is safety\" was the Pentagon's mantra, and the withdrawal was a superb example of military planning and logistics. Bases across Afghanistan were eciently packed up, closed down, and handed o to the Afghan army with-out a single American casualty, and C-17s made hundreds of /f_lights out with the remaining mat\u00e9riel of the American war, computers and coee makers all accounted for, leaving the Afghans who worked on the bases behind. On May 26, a small group of senators from both par- ties met with senior White House advisers in the Situation Room. /T_he senators argued for mass evacuations\u2014not just of SIV applicants, but of other Afghans at risk because of their association with the United States. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut later told me, \"I remember our expressing the sense very directly that there had to be an evacuation, beginning right then, of thousands of our Afghan partners to Guam. /T_he response basically was 'We're on it. Don't worry. We know what we're doing.' \" /T_hat same day, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Sta, told reporters, \"/T_here are plans being developed very, very rapidly here\" to bring out \"not just interpreters but a lot of other people that have worked with the United States.\" Asked about an airlift, Milley replied, \"/T_hat is a way of doing it.\" But the White House immediately shut the chair- man down. \"I can tell you that we have no plans for evacuations at this time,\" a National Security Council spokesperson said. \"/T_he State Department is processing SIV applications in Kabul. /T_hey are focused on ensuring that the system functions quickly and consistent with U.S. security and other application requirements.\" /T_here would be no more talk of airlifting Afghans to safety. As troops departed, the Taliban launched a spring oensive and closed in on provincial capitals throughout the south. Insurgent checkpoints blocked the roads to Kabul. \"I'm gravely concerned for a very precipitous dis-solution of the security environment,\" Crow, a member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, told me last March. \"We are underestimating the time-line for what would happen for a post-U.S. withdrawal in Afghanistan. I think it would be far quicker and more devastating than our current assessments group, viewed the Biden administration as the best hope for a new U.S. foreign policy of restraint, based on human rights, not militarism. /T_his meant not just ending the war but also saving the Afghans whose lives would be jeopardized by an American departure. McCoy was seen as an ally by the NSC; he spoke frequently with a senior ocial in the White House. On May/uni00A024, McCoy texted the ocial asking to talk about the lack of progress on SIVs. /T_he ocial called him late that night as she was driving home from the White House. /T_he ocial told McCoy that Guam raised legal problems as a U.S. territory. /T_his confused McCoy\u2014the whole point of Guam was to house Afghans somewhere on U.S. territory that was safe for them and that would allay American fears of terror on the mainland while their cases were processed. /T_he governor of Guam, where 8,000 hotel rooms stood empty because of COVID-19, would soon put out a welcome mat. But the State Department was concerned that setting foot in Guam would give Afghans a legal right to claim asylum in the U.S. even if they didn't pass security vetting. /T_his was a risk that might involve a tiny fraction of refugees, and by law those found to be potential threats would be sent back. /T_he ocial moved on to the larger problem. National- security ocials were in favor of evacuations, she said\u2014but the president's political advisers worried that the right would hammer Biden for resettling thousands of Mus-lims while historic numbers of Central American refugees were already overrunning the southern border. /T_he Afghan evacuees would become part of one giant immigration disaster, exploited hourly on Fox News, when the adminis-tration still had to pass a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill. \"Remember, this kind of crisis was coming at the worst 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 65 1/17/2022 5:27:15 PM /six.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyle/six.taboldstyle/six.taboldstyleMARCH 2022 THE time,\" a senior administration ocial told me. \"In the spring there was wall-to-wall coverage of the border\u2014'Who are these people coming into our country?'\u2014 and at the same time we're contemplating bringing in tens of thousands of Afghans. I feel passionately about it, but politically it could be risky.\" /T_he administration countered every urgent proposal with objections so unconvincing that they suggested a deeper, unexpressed resistance. /T_he Guam option\u2014already suspect because of the notional Afghans who might fail screening and need to be returned\u2014was downgraded to highly unlikely by the approach of typhoon season. When, in mid-June, I asked another senior administration ocial about Afghans who lived outside Kabul and were quickly losing any exit route, he replied, \"/T_he vast majority of SIV applicants, based on the work that could be done on this, are in or around Kabul.\" /T_his was untrue. Using a Facebook group that his white-paper co-author, Kim Staeri, had created, Matt Zeller polled SIV applicants and received 4,000 responses: Half of them were outside Kabul, with little or no way of safely reaching the capital with their family; hardly any inter-national /f_lights were taking o from provincial cities. Vietnam was the nightmare scenario that no one wanted to discuss. In July, when a reporter asked Biden if he foresaw any parallels in Afghanistan, the president retorted the way he had when he'd answered the question about his moral responsibility for Afghan women's rights: \"None whatso-ever. Zero.\" /T_he Taliban had nothing like the strength of the North Vietnamese army, he insisted. \"/T_here's going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted o the roof of an embassy of the United States from Afghanistan.\" But the Vietnam precedent was inescapable. On a trip to Kabul in 2016, I had heard that American diplomats were studying old cables sent between the Saigon embassy and Washington in the last days of South Vietnam. In 2015 the Obama administration had conducted a secret analysis of a potential /f_inal drawdown of troops from Afghanistan, and Vietnam always lurked in the background of discus-sions, according to a former White House ocial who took part. /T_he analysis showed that, if the U.S. reduced its troops to a reinforced Kabul embassy, there would be two dire consequences. First, the former ocial told me, the ability to gather intelligence on the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and the Islamic State would \"drop precipitously.\" Taliban fighters on top of a Humvee they seized from Afghan forces when they took Kabul JIM HUYLEBROEK 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 66 1/17/2022 5:27:16 PM66 /six.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstyleTHE BETRAYAL B Y G E O R G E P A C K E R Second, any evacuation of thousands of Americans from a landlocked country with poor or nonexistent infra structure would come down to \"a single point of failure\" at the Kabul airport, and it would be \"dangerously vulnerable\" to attack. \"/T_his was extremely risky short of paratroopers coming in,\" the former ocial said. He added that the disturbing evacu-ation analysis was likely \"a major factor\" in Obama's decision to keep almost 10,000 troops in Afghanistan. /T_he Vietnam analogy raised the specter of what Wash- ington insiders call \"optics.\" Mass evacuations would evoke images of one of the most vivid humiliations in the history of U.S. foreign policy, and those images would conjure an impression of chaos and defeat. It would make the reality all too clear: America had lost another war. /T_he Septem-ber/uni00A011 withdrawal date was an eort to blur that fact, suggesting the honorable completion of what had started exactly 20 years before\u2014not its tragic failure. \"Every week, someone was using the word optics to me,\" Chris Purdy, the director of Veterans for American Ideals, a project of Human Rights First, told me. \" 'We have to be concerned about optics.' I'm thinking, /T_hey're going to be murdered in the streets\u2014that's pretty bad optics .\" Most eorts to avoid bad optics avoid the truth and result in worse optics. In Vietnam, the last American ambassador in Saigon, Graham Martin, and his boss, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, believed that early evacuations of South Vietnamese, when the fall of Saigon might be weeks or months o, would cause the government's abrupt collapse. Biden-administration ocials made the same argument about Afghanistan. \"/T_he combination of two things\u2014our belief that we had more time, a lot more time, and that we didn't want to precipitate a crisis of con/f_idence in the government\u2014 that's what led us to the pace at which we were doing this,\" Antony Blinken told me. A senior White House ocial argued that if early evacuations and the announce-ment of a priority refugee program had been followed by the collapse of the Afghan government, \"the charge would have been that we undermined them.\" (No White House ocial would speak with me on the record about Afghanistan.) In June, Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan president, came to the White House and asked Biden to hold o on evacuating Afghans, to avoid initiating mass panic. Afterward, Ghani met with a few members of Congress. Jason Crow used his time to make the case for evacuations. \"I know what you're trying to do, Mr. Crow,\" Ghani replied with some heat. \"It's undermining what we're trying to do in creating some stability and security.\" Ghani didn't move Crow, but he gave the administration another reason not to do what it already didn't want to do. Biden later made Ghani's plea public./T_he spectacle of airlifts out of Hamid Karzai International Airport, of Afghans from civil society crossing borders to take advantage of a new American refugee program, would indeed have signi/f_ied a lack of con/f_idence in the Ghani gov-ernment, and perhaps induced something like the chaos that would come in late summer. But Afghanistan's fate was sealed the moment Biden gave his speech in April. No one in Washington or Kabul honestly believed that the Afghan government could survive the Americans' departure. \"/T_hey were done with us,\" Hamdullah Mohib, Ghani's national security adviser, told me. \"/T_he allies were fed up with us, and the Afghan people were also fed up with us.\" /T_he pretense of supporting a stable government gave everyone in power a chance to save face at the expense of ordinary Afghans. /T_he Biden administration thought Kabul wouldn't fall before 2022. Most outside experts agreed. \"I can tell you, having sat through every single meeting that took place on this topic and having read every single intelligence assess-ment, military document, State Department cable,\" the senior White House ocial told me, \"there was nobody anywhere in our government, even up until a day or two before Kabul fell, that foresaw the collapse of the govern-ment and army before the end of our troop withdrawal at the end of August, and most of the projections were that there would still be weeks to months before we would face the very real prospect of the collapse of Kabul.\" But while waiting for Kabul to fall, the administration could have timed the military withdrawal to support evac-uations, rather than pulling out all the hard assets while leaving all the soft targets behind. It could have created an interagency task force, vested with presidential authority and led by an evacuations czar\u2014the only way to force dif-ferent agencies to coordinate resources in order to solve a problem that is limited in scope but highly complex. It could have assembled comprehensive lists of thousands of names, locations, email addresses, and phone numbers\u2014 not just for interpreters like Khan, but for others at risk, including women like Hawa. It could have begun to quietly organize /f_lights on commercial aircraft in the spring\u2014moving 1,000 people a week\u2014and gradually increased the numbers. It could have used the prospect of lifting sanctions and giving international recognition to a future Taliban government as leverage, demanding secure air/f_ields and safe passage for Afghans whom the Americans wanted to bring out with them. It could have used air/f_ields in Hert, Mazar-i-Sharif, Jalalabad, and Kandahar while those cities remained out of Taliban control. It could have drawn up emergency plans for Afghan evacuations and rehearsed them in interagency drills. It could have included NATO allies in the planning. 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 67 1/17/2022 5:27:16 PM /six.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstyle/six.taboldstyle/eight.taboldstyleMARCH 2022 THE ATLANTIC It could have shown imagination and initiative. But the administration did none of this. Instead, it studied the problem in endless meetings. While studying the problem, the government accelerated visa processing and reduced the wait time from four years to just under two. /T_he number of SIV holders and fam-ily members reaching the U.S. rose from fewer than 300 a month through the winter and spring to 513 in June. /T_hat month, a COVID outbreak at the embassy stopped interviews for several weeks. With Afghanistan visibly col-lapsing, new applications arrived in record numbers. /T_he administration looked for countries where applicants could be /f_lown and housed while their cases were processed. Negotiations with various European allies, Central Asian countries, and Persian Gulf kingdoms consumed the State Department's time and energy, but no /f_irm deals were made. Why would other countries accept U.S.-aliated Afghans whom America regarded as too potentially dan-gerous to bring onto its own soil? These efforts were always several steps behind the deteriorating reality in Afghanistan. /T_his sluggishness in the face of impending calamity continued the same self- deception, prevarication, and groupthink\u2014the same inability to grasp the hard truths of Afghanistan\u2014that had plagued the entire 20-year war. As the advocates' desperation grew, some of them began to harbor a suspicion that they were being played by the administration\u2014that all the meetings in the Situ-ation Room and the backgrounders with mid-level o-cials were meant to give an impression of movement that would never result in action. \"What they thought they were going to do was pull all the U.S. assets out, and the Afghan government would hold on long enough so that, when it collapsed, there would be no photographs of the evacuation,\" Mike Breen, of Human Rights First, told me. \"/T_here wouldn't be a Sai-gon moment, because there wouldn't be any Americans around and any American helicopters to hang o. /T_hey thought the Afghan military was going to die in place to buy them time.\" /T_his scenario recalled the \"decent inter-val\" that Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger had sought between the end of the American war in Vietnam and the demise of the South Vietnamese government, to avoid the optics of an American defeat. As Biden had put it to Richard Holbrooke, this was how Nixon and Kissinger tried to get away with it. Steve Miska, a leader of Evacuate Our Allies, concluded that the main obstacle must be the president. Nothing else made sense. Miska, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, thought that if he could just /f_ind a way to reach Biden, the president would understand the issue's importance to veterans. If only Beau were alive , Miska thought, he would have been able to get through to his father. Miska approached Denis McDonough, the secretary of veter-ans aairs, who immediately grasped the implication for his constituency. /T_he department augmented its mental-health hotline in case Afghanistan vets began to see their interpreters beheaded on social media. Sam Ayres, a law student and former Army Ranger who had served three tours in Afghanistan as an enlisted infantryman, sent a letter to several people he knew in the administration, explaining why the issue mattered so personally to many veterans. He wrote that the faces and voices of individual interpreters stayed with American troops long after they returned home. He described driving past Dover Air Force Base, where the caskets of two of his Army teammates had arrived in 2018 and 2019. \"For the next couple hours of my drive, I was thrust back into the on going debate in my mind about whether our service\u2014and the loss of teammates, American and Afghan\u2014was all a waste,\" Ayres wrote. \"Many of us veterans will spend the rest of our lives grappling with this question. At the very least, I hope we'll be able to feel we did something honorable over there in our small corner of the war. /T_hat would provide some solace. But coming to that conclu-sion will be even harder if the Afghans who went out on missions with us are left to die at the hands of our onetime enemies.\" /T_he letter received a pro forma response. During the /f_inal withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden's main\u2014at times, it seemed, his only\u2014focus was on keep-ing the number of American casualties as close to zero as possible. He didn't reckon with the invisible harm of adding moral injury to military failure. /W.sc/i.sc/t.sc/h.sc/i.sc/n.sc /t.sc/h.sc/e.sc /a.sc/d.sc/m.sc/i.sc/n.sc/i.sc/s.sc/t.sc/r.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc, a few indicators were starting to /f_lash red. By July the CIA, which had given the Afghan government a year back in April, now judged that it might fall in a matter of weeks. As it moved out of its bases around the country, the CIA decided to keep open a base called Eagle, near the Kabul airport, as a transit point in the event that the agency's counterparts in the Afghan National Directorate of Security, along with their families, had to be evacuated quickly. On July 13, Secretary Blinken received a \"dissent- channel cable\" from the embassy in Kabul, written by dip-lomats who disagreed with ocial policy. /T_he cable warned that the Taliban were making rapid advances, and that the collapse of the Ghani government could happen within 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 68 1/17/2022 5:27:17 PM68 /six.taboldstyle/nine.taboldstyleTHE BETRAYAL B Y G E O R G E P A C K E R weeks. It urged the Biden administration to begin emer- gency evacuations of Afghan allies. Around the same time, the Atrocity Early Warning Task Force, an executive-branch committee, began drafting an assessment of how to prevent massacres in Afghanistan after a Taliban takeover. Throughout the summer, the National Security Council held weekly virtual brie/f_ings for friendly groups like Common Defense, to enlist their help in amplify-ing the administration's message and defusing criticism. Alex McCoy attended the brie/f_ings, but by July he had become so skeptical of what he was hearing that he began to secretly record the sessions. /T_he brie/f_ing ocial was Carlyn Reichel, the White House speechwriter who had phoned him with the good news in advance of Biden's speech in April. Week after week, in answer to increasingly pointed questions about SIVs and evacuations, Reichel kept oering the same vaguely positive phrases, which had the eect of de/f_lating any hope of action: \"We are explor-ing all options and planning for every contingency\"; \"I can assure you that we are working on it and that it has very senior levels of attention in this building.\" On July 14, Reichel informed McCoy and others that the president was about to announce a new initiative, called Operation Allies Refuge. /T_he U.S. government would soon begin bringing SIV holders on /f_lights to America. Reichel called them \"relocation /f_lights for interested and eligible Afghans.\" /T_he phrasing was curious; it avoided the word evacuation, and it suggested that some visa holders didn't want to leave Afghanistan. On July/uni00A08, Biden had claimed that \"fewer than half\" of SIV holders had chosen to leave. /T_his became a persistent talking point, and a false one: Almost all of the remaining Afghans with visas were in ocial limbo, waiting for the United Nations to put them on /f_lights to the U.S., or for family members to receive passports and visas. /T_he president, echoed by his ocials, was trying to blame the Afghans for their own entrapment. Still, with a presidential speech, a named operation, and planned /f_lights, the administration /f_inally appeared to be taking action. \"It seemed like they were belatedly meeting the concerns we were raising,\" McCoy later told me. But nothing happened until July/uni00A030, when one charter /f_light brought 221 SIV holders and family members to Fort Lee, outside Richmond, Virginia. /T_hese were Afghans whose visas had already been approved; the U.S. government was simply accelerating their arrival. McCoy began to think that Opera-tion Allies Refuge was a \"performative stunt,\" intended to convince ordinary voters in, say, Michigan and Pennsylvania who might have seen something on TV about endangered Afghans that the administration had it covered.After the military's lightning withdrawal, the embassy was still moving at the pace of a mission with months to go. \"From our perspective, the State Department was relying on a lot of hope that things weren't going to fall apart in the face of increasingly bleak intelligence reports on a daily basis,\" a soldier who remained in Afghanistan throughout the summer told me. \"/T_he military was just waiting for a decision point or guidance from the State Department, and it never came until things fell apart.\" On August 2, the administration /f_inally announced a priority refugee program, which it had been discussing since the spring, for several categories of vulnerable Afghans who didn't qualify for SIVs. But no Afghan could use the program\u2014 it existed only on paper, because there was no infrastructure for processing refugees in the neighboring countries to which they might /f_lee. More relocation /f_lights brought more interested and eligible SIV families to the U.S.; by mid-August the total was just under 2,000 people. /T_he administration continued to explore all options and plan for every contingency. Major cities across Afghani-stan fell to the Taliban. /T_he Atrocity Early Warning Task Force /f_inished its assessment on potential massacres and was about to start planning for ways to prevent them. An ocial who worked on the assessment later told me, \"It was /f_inalized the week before everything went to shit.\" IV . FLOWERS When Hawa, the Afghan special-forces lieutenant, learned from the media that her U.S. counterparts were about to leave Bagram Air Base, she was stunned. \"Really?\" she asked the American women on the base. /T_he Americans apologized\u2014they hadn't believed it would happen either. To Hawa the Americans were still needed, and the future looked dire without them. 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 69 1/17/2022 5:27:17 PM /six.taboldstyle/nine.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyleMARCH 2022 THE ATLANTIC /T_he shock in the Afghan army was widespread. /T_he departure of foreign troops, contractors, technical support, and military intelligence dealt a fatal blow to morale. /T_he Afghans' job was now to hold out for a few months and then die in place. Hawa was transferred to the Afghan special forces' base in Kabul. A few days later, in the predawn darkness on July/uni00A02, the Americans packed up Bagram, switched o the electricity, and /f_lew out of the nerve center of the war without telling the new Afghan commander. In Kabul, Hawa trained new Female Tactical Platoons and awaited word on her visa application from Captain Alice Spence. On July 15, Spence texted her about Opera-tion Allies Refuge: \"Hi sweet Hawa, USA has good news and will evacuate many Afghans soon. I am still working on your application. Please stay safe and we will get you out.\" \"/T_hat's really good news,\" Hawa replied. \"/T_hank you so much my kind azizam.\" She asked if her younger sister could be included in the evacuation. Spence said that she would try. By July 31 she and her group of U.S.-military women had completed paperwork for several dozen FTPs and sent it to the State Department. Talibs had a practice of killing any female troops they found. In early August, as the Taliban conquered province after province, Hawa's commander told the FTPs to take 20 days' leave and go home for their own safety. Hawa knew that this was the end of her service. \"/T_hat day was the bitterest day of my life,\" she told me. And yet she still didn't believe that the men with beards, long hair, and AK-47s would be able to enter the capital. Kabul was reinforced with the Afghan army's best troops, including commandos she had fought alongside. Hawa thought they would keep the Taliban out at any cost. /T_he foreign forces wouldn't allow it, either. /T_hey would return and defend the Afghan government\u2014 or what had all the /f_ighting and suering been for? /I.sc/n.sc /s.sc/o.sc/u.sc/t.sc/h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/s.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/n.sc /A.sc/f.sc/g.sc/h.sc/a.sc/n.sc/i.sc/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/n.sc, Khan was closely following news from Washington. /T_he announcement of Operation Allies Refuge raised his hopes; so did a bill passed by Congress at the end of July that increased the cap on Afghan SIVs by 8,000 and allowed applicants to defer their medical exam until they reached the U.S. But the sound of /f_ighting kept getting closer to the cen-ter of his town, and the electricity kept going out in the rented house where he, Mina, and their small son were hunkered down. When the Taliban announced a new policy of clemency for interpreters who confessed and asked for forgiveness, Khan saw a trap to keep Afghans like him from trying to escape, so they could then be slaughtered. /T_he murder of his family members and the threatening letter at his back gate had made the Talibs' views on interpreters clear enough. Khan's family's interview at the U.S. embassy, one of the last steps before visas would be issued, was canceled in June because of the COVID outbreak. /T_hey were given a new appointment on July/uni00A029. /T_he Taliban had set up sev-eral checkpoints along the road to Kabul, where they had beheaded an interpreter in May. Khan and Mina decided to hire a more expensive ambulance taxi to the capital rather than risk a regular one. Her pregnancy gave them a good cover story, backed by a copy of her ultrasound and a bottle of prescription medicine. She hid their docu-ments and a USB /f_lash drive under her robe. Khan had grown his beard out, put on ragged clothes, and wiped his phone clean\u2014the Taliban looked at everything, even Google search histories.The VA augmented its mental-health hotline in case Afghanistan veterans began to see their interpreters beheaded on social media. 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 70 1/17/2022 5:27:18 PM70 /seven.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyleTHE BETRAYAL B Y G E O R G E P A C K E R On the road they encountered two Taliban check- points. /T_hey were allowed through the /f_irst without being stopped; at the second they were stopped and insurgents glanced inside before letting the ambulance continue. But Khan saw them questioning passengers in other vehicles, mostly young men in their 20s and early 30s with no turbans or beards. \"I think they were searching for people who worked with U.S. forces,\" he told me later. In Kabul the family had to keep changing their lodging as each place began to seem unsafe. Khan heard accounts of targeted killings of government workers that went un reported in international media. /T_he city was /f_illing up with refugees from the /f_ighting in other provinces. He /f_inally found a room in a cheap hotel, near the inter-national green zone, that was a way station for Afghans like him\u2014interpreters and others hoping for a /f_light out. /T_he interview at the U.S. embassy lasted no more than /f_ive minutes. Khan mentioned Mohammad's death, the threatening letter, Mina's pregnancy\u2014a few more weeks and she would no longer be allowed to /f_ly. /T_hey had barely left the embassy when Khan received a text with instructions for their medical exams. Ordinarily the wait would have been months, but the exams took place on August/uni00A02, at a cost of $1,414 for the family. Khan was running out of money. Everything was moving quickly now. /T_he oce of Jason Crow, the Colorado congressman, brought the family to the attention of the State Department, which expedited Khan's case (I had alerted Crow's oce to their situation and pro-vided Khan's family with other help). His lawyer from IRAP , Julie Kornfeld, was trying to obtain plane tickets with the help of an organization called Miles4Migrants. Khan went to a travel agency and found a scene of panic. Seats were going at famine prices. \"If you do not book tickets soon, they will not be available, because people are leaving,\" the travel agent told Khan. /T_he visas might still take weeks to be issued, and Khan was down to his last $50. But if he returned to his hometown he might never get out. All of these clocks were ticking against him and his family: money, visas, tickets, Mina's pregnancy, the Taliban. Khan decided to stay in Kabul and wait. A bus convoy full of Afghans seeking to flee the country drives through the night toward the Kabul airport on August 22. It navigated checkpoints manned by both Taliban fighters and CIA-backed paramilitaries before entering the airport via the northwestern gate.ANDREW QUILTY / banks and passport oces, even with the Taliban just 20 miles away, a paralyzing denial settled over people in Kabul. It was possible to know that the city was in imminent danger and at the same time to believe that it couldn't fall. A surprising number of Afghan Americans traveled to Kabul in the summer of 2021 for weddings or family visits. /T_he same denial prevailed in Washington: On the weekend of August 14-15, most of the senior leadership of the Biden administration was away on vacation. /T_he fall of Kabul would always happen sometime in the future. \"It was like a joke to me,\" Hamasa Parsa, a 23-year-old Afghan army captain who worked as an assistant in the defense minister's oce, said. \"I never thought that the Taliban would come to Kabul, even when Joe Biden said that our war is /f_inished.\" On hearing Biden's speech in April, Parsa (whose name has been changed for her safety) had cried and wondered whether the president felt any regret. But she was sure that Kabul, where she had grown up under American protection, was too big and modern to fall to the Taliban. \"Kabul is a city full of younger generations,\" she said, \"full of girls and boys who can talk, who can /f_ight with their writing, with their speaking.\" Parsa loved to read and write novels, and after work she would meet three of her friends at a crowded coee shop in downtown Kabul called Nosh Book Caf\u00e9. \"It was like a heaven for us,\" she said. Young men and women sat together at tables, the girls' scarves falling back onto their shoulders, everyone talking, working at laptops, smoking cigarettes. For such a city to fall would mean the end of the only life Afghans like Parsa had ever known. /T_he rest of the country might now belong to the Taliban\u2014perhaps it always had\u2014but not Kabul. /T_his Afghan illusion, wide-spread until the very end, was nourished by American illusions\u2014 by our refusal to face that we had neither the will nor the ability to create something durable in Afghani-stan, that one day we would abandon them. /I.sc/n.sc /e.sc/a.sc/r.sc/l.sc/y.sc /A.sc/u.sc/g.sc/u.sc/s.sc/t.sc Najeeb Monawari was in Bangla- desh, so focused on the news from his homeland that he was unable to work. His foreign postings with Doctors Without Borders had kept him safely out of Afghani-stan as the country descended into extreme violence, but he worried constantly for his family back home. His wife begged him to get her and their three small children out too, and he researched every possible way. /T_he $125,000 purchase price for citizenship in a Carib-bean country was too expensive. He even looked into immigrating with his family to Sierra Leone. As the Taliban swept through Afghanistan, Monawari read online that the Canadian government was setting up a new emergency immigration program for Afghans with connections to Canada. Monawari immediately applied. On August/uni00A07, he received an email from the Canadian gov-ernment: \"We received your application and you are being invited to an appointment for biometric collection (/f_inger-prints).\" Monawari had worked with the Americans for four years, then waited 10 years for a U.S. visa that was /f_inally, unjustly denied. He had worked with the Canadians long ago for a year, and they answered his prayers in a few weeks. \"Hello dear Sir/Madam,\" he wrote back, \"thank you very much for saving my family and myself life.\" Monawari was now determined to get to Kabul. His mother told him that he would be crazy to come back at this moment. So did his colleagues in Bangladesh, including one who warned him that the Kabul airport would close before he could get his family out. So did a retired Green Beret weapons sergeant in Texas named Larry Ryland, who got back in touch with his former interpreter during the Taliban oensive and practically ordered him to stay in Bangladesh. Even the Canadian government warned him o. On the morning of August/uni00A08, a second email arrived: \"Dear Sir, PLEASE DO NOT TRAVEL TO KABUL.\" Monawari disregarded all the advice. He was in the grip of a furious monomania: He had to get to Kabul, be /f_inger printed, and /f_ly out with his family. Maybe to Canada, maybe even to the U.S.\u2014he hadn't lost faith in his second try for an SIV. He could summon intense optimism while feeling intense pain. \"I just put myself on /f_ire,\" he later told me. \"When you want to survive, you get blind, you just struggle.\" Monawari arrived in Kabul on the night of Wednes- day, August/uni00A011. First thing the next morning, he and his wife brought their passports and the email invitation to a Canadian military camp near the airport\u2014the embassy was now closed to visitors\u2014and talked their way past an Afghan guard. No one was on duty except one elderly Canadian, who took their /f_ingerprints. On Saturday, August/uni00A014, Monawari went to the bank where he kept his savings. He had intended to withdraw only a little, but when he saw the large and panicky crowd he thought the bank might shut its doors. He took out almost all the money he had and left with his pockets bulging with euros, sweating, tensed for someone in the crowd to pull a gun on him. /K.sc/h.sc/a.sc/n.sc, /h.sc/i.sc/d.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /w.sc/i.sc/t.sc/h.sc /M.sc/i.sc/n.sc/a.sc and their son in the cen- ter of Kabul, kept refreshing a State Department website 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 72 1/17/2022 5:27:20 PM72 /seven.taboldstyle/three.taboldstyleTHE BETRAYAL B Y G E O R G E P A C K E R showing the status of his visa every 20 or 30 minutes.

But Khan waited the next three days for a summons to pick up their passports at the embassy, and his emails went unanswered. On August/uni00A014, unable to wait any longer, he left the hotel where they were staying and ventured into Kabul's forti-/f_ied green zone. Outside the U.S. embassy a guard couldn't make sense of the various emails with which Khan had armed himself. Another guard told him to come back on a better day. Khan didn't realize that, inside the embassy, in preparation for evacuation to the airport, diplomats were smashing up hard drives, destroying American /f_lags and other symbols that could be used for Taliban propaganda, and /f_illing sacks with documents for burning. Khan insisted that his case was urgent, and he was /f_inally allowed inside. At the consular oce the family's passports were waiting, miraculously stamped with the Special Immigrant Visas that had eluded Khan and thousands of other Afghans for so long. /T_hey'd been ready since August/uni00A011.

It didn't matter\u2014Julie Kornfeld had booked three tickets to the U.S. via Istanbul and Brazil on T uesday, August/uni00A017, three days away.

She reminded her that she'd seen her name on a death list sent by the Taliban to the defense minister's oce. \"Hamasa, come on, stop crying, I'm okay,\" her friend said. \"Nothing's going to happen.

For three days Mohib had been talking with American diplomats in Kabul about transferring power to an interim government and spar-ing the city the urban warfare that had destroyed it in the 1990s. Ghani wanted to hold a loya jirga\u2014a conference of political leaders\u2014 in two weeks. It would essentially hand power to the Taliban, but by constitutional means. Ghani wanted this to be part of his legacy. But he and Secretary Blinken hadn't discussed the idea until the night before, when Blinken agreed to send an envoy to Doha. At the 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 73 1/17/2022 5:27:20 PM /seven.taboldstyle/three.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstyle/four.taboldstyleMARCH 2022 THE ATLANTIC Sunday-morning meeting, Ghani's advisers decided on a team that would /f_ly to Doha that evening. Taliban repre-sentatives there had agreed that the insurgents would stay out of Kabul during negotiations. But Afghan intelligence knew that factions were competing to take the city, and that government forces would melt away rather than die in a pointless /f_ight. /T_hat morning, Khalil Haqqani, whose Islamist network had in/f_licted numerous suicide bombings on Kabul, called Mohib and told him to surrender. Around 11/uni00A0a.m., Ghani and Mohib were talking in a garden on the palace grounds when they heard automatic-weapons /f_ire. /T_hey later learned that guards at a nearby bank were dispersing customers trying to withdraw their money\u2014but at the sound of gun/f_ire everything fell apart. Sta began to abandon the palace. Guards took o their uniforms and went home in the civilian clothes they wore underneath. As Mohib prepared to escort Ghani's wife by helicopter to the airport for a /f_light to Dubai, the pilot told him that Afghan troops had prevented one of the presidential helicopters from leaving the airport and /f_ired shots at another that was going to pick up the defense minister. /T_hese troops were not about to let their leaders save their own skins. \"When I heard that, I felt, We are done,\" Mohib told me. He quickly returned from the helipad to the palace. \"It's time to leave,\" he told the president. Ghani had been worried about the fate of his cherished library. He didn't even have his passport or a change of clothes. \"I have to go upstairs and get some things,\" he said. \"No, there's no time,\" Mohib insisted.Ghani, having convinced the Americans to leave his endangered people in harm's way, was /f_lown by helicopter with his wife and a few advisers to safety in Uzbekistan. /J.sc/u.sc/s.sc/t.sc /b.sc/e.sc/f.sc/o.sc/r.sc/e.sc /n.sc/o.sc/o.sc/n.sc, Hawa was riding a bus to col- lect her uniform and papers, so her identity wouldn't be discovered if the base where she kept them was attacked, when her mother called. /T_he Taliban were in their area of western Kabul, searching for military people, her mother said. Hawa should not come home. Not knowing what to do, Hawa texted Alice Spence in Hawaii, where it was still Saturday night: \"/T_he Taliban come to our area. I am outside I don't know how should I go home ohhh.\" \"Oh God Hawa,\" Spence wrote back a minute later. \"Ok where are you? You are not in Kabul?\" \"Yes I am at Kabul. /T_hey came to Kabul.\"\"Fuck.\" Spence continued, \"Ok it will be ok.\" She advised Hawa to /f_ind a safe way home and hide all her documents and anything suggesting military aliation.\"/T_hank you dear sorry about the bad news,\" Hawa wrote.\"Don't be sorry the Talib they will be sorry.\"\"Okay dear. I really scared.\" \"I know. Please be brave Hawa. I will not go to sleep until you are safe.\" Hawa was lucky to be wearing a long dress and a scarf that she'd put on to avoid trouble with the Pash-tun women outside the base. She later heard that Talibs were ordering girls to cover themselves, and shot one who refused. /T_hey also shot a military woman discovered in her house. Hawa's face was recognizable\u2014she had appeared in army recruitment ads on social media. With nowhere else to go, she searched for a taxi home, but no driver would take her, and she spent four hours trying to get there, through streets thronged with people running. For two days she didn't leave her house. /F.sc/r.sc/o.sc/m.sc /h.sc/i.sc/s.sc /h.sc/o.sc/t.sc/e.sc/l.sc /r.sc/o.sc/o.sc/m.sc that morning Khan saw smoke rising above the U.S. embassy as the last burn bags were incinerated. /T_hey included the passports of Afghan visa hopefuls, who would now have to try to escape without them. It was protocol to destroy that kind of thing dur-ing a noncombatant- evacuation operation, and no one at the embassy was willing to break the rules and bring the passports to the airport. /T_he removal of the embassy to the airport had been carefully planned at the Pentagon, but with no discussion of how to bring out Afghans. Khan saw Chinook transport helicopters taking o from the embassy grounds every 15 minutes and clattering low over city streets the short distance to the airport. \"/T_his is not Saigon,\" Blinken insisted on a Sunday- morning news show. Around noon, the hotel manager told Khan and the other interpreters lodged there to leave. With the Tali-ban in Kabul, the interpreters were now a security risk. Khan, Mina, and their son wept as they packed their bags. /T_here were no taxis and most hotels were closed, so they walked for an hour and a half around central Kabul until they found a room in a dirty hotel. Talibs could be seen in the streets outside. /T_he day before, with visas and tickets /f_inally in hand, Khan had felt like one of the saved. Now the /f_light had been canceled and, because of the Afghan government's sudden demise, the airport was closed. \"We came to a bad fate,\" Khan told Julie Kornfeld. \"I don't want to give you false hope,\" she said, \"but I do still have a little.\" She urged him to get some sleep until there was news of /f_lights out. /seven.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyleTHE BETRAYAL B Y G E O R G E P A C K E R \"Can you listen to soothing music, or take deep breaths, or, we have a saying, 'count sheep'?

One of them urged him to get to the airport immediately\u2014the oce of Senator /T_hom Tillis had put his name on a list. It was nearly midnight. When Monawari looked out the window he saw streets deserted of every living creature except stray dogs. /T_hinking this might be his only chance, Monawari woke his three children and prepared a backpack with food and printouts of SIV correspondence. He had to ask his neighbors to move their cars so he could get out. His mother told him that leaving the building at this hour tipped the neighbors o that he was a \"traitor.\" /T_he airport was only 15 minutes away, but Monawari drove so fast that his father, who came along, warned him that the police might shoot at the car. But there were no police. Kabul was under no one's control, and looting had broken out around the city. /T_he Taliban were as unprepared as everyone else for the speed of their conquest. /T_hat day their leader in Doha, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, asked the head of U.S. Central Command, General Mc Kenzie, whether the Americans wanted control of the city during the evacuation. McKenzie replied that his orders were to secure the airport and nothing else. U.S. troops were not to venture beyond its perimeter. \"/T_he Taliban were willing to let us do all that was necessary to control the terrain to get out,\" a former senior military ocer told me. \"When you consciously choose that the terrain you control is the fence line of the airport, you give up a lot of your prerogatives, and you permit yourself to be quite vulnerable to in/f_iltration by suicide bombers.\" /T_he exchange between Baradar and McKenzie would contrib-ute to making the evacuation the nightmare that it became. Monawari parked on a side street and left his father with the car. Hamid Karzai International Airport is small, with a cramped passenger terminal and a single runway. On the north side of the runway were a series of small bases belonging to NATO countries and the Afghan army. Civil-ians approaching from the city entered through the South Gate. /T_he airport was ringed by miles of forti/f_ications\u2014concrete blast walls, Hesco bags, concertina wire\u2014with about eight public or unocial entry points. /T_hat night thousands of Afghans converged on the ter- minal at the South Gate. Monawari left his wife and chil-dren next to a wall for cover and tried to get close enough to /f_ind someone who could bring them inside. Four U.S. armored vehicles blocked the way, and Marines /f_ired warn-ing shots. People were shouting and running back and forth JIM HUYLEBROEKAfghans wait outside an entrance to Kabul's airport on August 22.

Some Afghans, mostly single men with no American connections, had gotten inside the terminal and would eventually force their way, two with guns, onto C-17s intended to transport U.S. personnel and mat\u00e9riel to Qatar. Monawari spent the night looking for some authority with a list of names that included his. But there was no such author-ity. /T_here was no list. On that /f_irst night Monawari learned what everyone who dared to come to the airport would have to /f_ind out for themselves during the next two weeks: /T_here was no system, no plan. /T_hey were on their own. Shortly before dawn, a report /f_lew around that Talibs were arriving. Afghan paramilitaries in civilian clothes suddenly disappeared. Monawari thought of running. Beyond the South Gate he saw a pickup with Taliban gun-men sitting in the bed, their legs hanging over the sides. /T_his /f_irst sight of them in Kabul frightened him. He was their enemy, and they had the upper hand. After daybreak the entrance road swelled with new crowds trying to reach the airport. Monawari and his fam-ily had spent nine hours outside the terminal. /T_hey had exhausted their crackers and water, and the kids were out of control. He decided to take the family home. \"It is a big mess right now,\" he texted the Green Berets stateside. At home he heard from a friend that Talibs would be searching houses that night. He burned his military cer-ti/f_icates and SIV documents. He asked his mother if he could hide his Green Beret uniform, but she said that their apartment was too small\u2014it would be found. With a pair of scissors, he cut to shreds his cherished uniform and hat and unit patches. He put the remains in a garbage bag for his father to take outside and bury deep in the trash. /A.sc/r.sc/o.sc/u.sc/n.sc/d.sc /m.sc/i.sc/d.sc/n.sc/i.sc/g.sc/h.sc/t.sc /o.sc/n.sc /S.sc/u.sc/n.sc/d.sc/a.sc/y.sc, Sam Ayres, the former Ranger who'd sent the letter about veterans to Biden-administration contacts, texted his friend Alice Spence, whom he'd gone to college with. He was trying to /f_ind a way to help Khan, whose case he'd heard about. \"My FTP was hanged last week,\" Spence told him. Mahjabin\u2014the woman who, along with Hawa, was Spence's closest friend among the Afghans\u2014had been killed in the bathroom of her in-laws' house a week before the fall of Kabul. It wasn't clear whether Talibs had done it, but Mahjabin's picture had been circulating around their checkpoints outside the city. \"Oh Jesus,\" Ayres wrote. \"I'm so sorry.\"\"She was a magni/f_icent I loved her so much.\" After a moment: \"I refuse to let this happen to the rest of them.\" In those /f_irst hours and days after the fall of Kabul, thou- sands of people in the U.S. and across the world began to live mentally in the city and its airport. Most of them had a personal connection to Afghanistan. More Ameri-cans cared about the country than the Biden administration had accounted for in its political calculations. Most of these Americans were in their 30s or 40s\u2014the generation that came of age with the 9/11 wars, now reaching a calamitous end. Helping Afghans escape would become a way to avoid succumbing to a sense of waste and despair and helpless rage. Veterans approached friends to oer or seek help for interpreters they knew, and these informal networks grew to a dozen or 50 people on Signal and WhatsApp, with smaller side groups connecting to military and political con-tacts and refugee organizations. Members of Congress with high pro/f_iles on the SIV issue received hundreds of texts on their personal phones from complete strangers, some of them Americans looking for help, others desperate Afghans reaching for any name they could /f_ind. Jason Crow got a voicemail from a man who was barely audible, as if he was hiding somewhere: \"I'm sorry if I bother you, but as you know better than me that the situation getting worse and worse in Afghanistan, especially for my people and my fam-ily. And this morning, they've killed one of the young boys.\" Congressional oces became 24-hour operations centers. Some groups\u2014West Point alums, retired Special Forces operators, women's-rights advocates\u2014grew to several hun-dred and acquired names like Task Force Dunkirk and Task Force Pineapple. /T_hey spanned time zones and continents. Other groups consisted of three or four friends working their contacts. Mary Beth Goodman, the ocial who leads the State Department's global pandemic response, took two weeks o to spend every hour on evacuations, except the two or three at night when she slept, and even those hours were interrupted by phone calls, including one from an Afghan man in a convoy bound for the airport, whispering that ISIS terrorists had just boarded the bus, before the line went dead. Using digital devices, foreigners tried to navigate Afghans thousands of miles away through the needle eyes of Kabul's airport gates. /T_his global eort emerged spontaneously to /f_ill the gaping void left by the U.S. government. In spite of three deployments, Sam Ayres had no close personal ties in Afghanistan. He wanted to help Afghans escape as a moral imperative, and out of loyalty to Alice Spence. Spence was propelled by the memory of her dead friend, whom she now had no time to grieve, and the dis-tress calls of friends like Hawa who were still alive. /S.sc/e.sc/v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/a.sc/l.sc /h.sc/o.sc/u.sc/r.sc/s.sc /b.sc/e.sc/f.sc/o.sc/r.sc/e.sc /d.sc/a.sc/w.sc/n.sc on Wednesday, August/uni00A018, Hawa got a message from Spence: She should be at the airport by sunrise. Spence instructed Hawa not 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 76 1/17/2022 5:27:22 PM76 /seven.taboldstyle/seven.taboldstyleTHE BETRAYAL B Y G E O R G E P A C K E R to bring a suitcase, to wear a full face covering, and to hide her smartphone, keeping a simple Nokia in hand, in case she ran into Taliban checkpoints. /T_he smartphone would have everything she needed to communicate with Spence and others and for them to share locations, as well as important documents\u2014 but it could also give her away. Spence and her colleagues were trying to bring a group of 16 FTPs and 10 dependents\u2014 husbands and children\u2014 into the airport. /T_he SIV applications submitted in July had gone nowhere, but at least they provided the paper-work for identity packets to be sent to State Department inboxes, set up after the fall of Kabul as a clearinghouse for potential evacuees. /T_he inboxes were soon overwhelmed, and the government asked people to stop sending names. What mattered most, Spence discovered\u2014 and this would be the key to all successful evacuation eorts\u2014was hav-ing a contact inside the airport. \"/T_he people with the most power at that time were low-ranking gate guards,\" she told me. \"/T_hey had more power than any general in D.C., hands down.\" Representative Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat, put it this way: \"/T_his was a situa-tion where knowing the secretary of state and the national security adviser personally was vastly less valuable than knowing a Marine major on the air/f_ield.\" Hawa packed a small bag with a change of clothes and her passport. She set out with her teenage sister for the North Gate, on the military side of the airport. At the gate\u2014a barrier of concertina wire between sections of 16-foot blast walls\u2014was a crush of human beings, includ-ing families with small children, all trying to push forward under the blinding sun until they could speak to a soldier. On the outer perimeter of security were Taliban guards, using whips, gun stocks, and bullets to intimidate the crowd. /T_he middle layer consisted of a paramilitary force from the Afghan intelligence agency, which was under the command of overseas CIA agents via WhatsApp, and which was liberal with warning shots. Inside the gate, and often outside, were American troops, who sometimes used tear gas and /f_lash-bangs for crowd control. Spence put Hawa in charge of keeping track of the other 15 FTPs, who arrived separately from around the city. \"Can you please count how many FTPs are there,\" Spence texted. There was no answer for 20 minutes. \"Hawa I need your help.\" \"They bring a lot of their families,\" Hawa finally replied. /T_here were at least a dozen family members\u2014parents, siblings\u2014who had not been on the original list and had to be counted one by one in the crowd. Spence encouraged her: \"Yes I know but you are soldier.\" Keeping track of the families while pushing toward the gate was like a mission\u2014the hardest Hawa had taken part in. She sent a head count and then asked if she could call her two other sisters to join them. Spence told her to hurry. It was eight in the morning and the group was 150 feet from the gate. /T_hey waited all day. As they ran out of food and water, some of the FTPs began to faint. When Talibs found mili-tary papers on one woman, they set on her with /f_ists and feet, leaving a swollen eye and a large purple bruise on her cheek. A round of gun/f_ire nearly struck the baby of one of the women, who decided to go home. Hawa's teenage sister cried that she wanted to go home too. \"If the Tali-ban come to our house you won't be able to go to school,\" Hawa told her; they had no future here. One FTP reached the gate and showed an American guard a picture on her phone of an \"emergency visa\" that read: \"Present this visa to security checkpoints and Consular With a pair of scissors, he cut to shreds his cherished Green Beret uniform and hat and patches. He put the remains in a garbage bag for his father to take outside and bury deep in the trash. 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 77 1/17/2022 5:27:23 to access /f_lights departing for the United States.\" It was a PDF that the State Department had created and emailed to SIV applicants. Now everyone in Kabul seemed to have a copy. /T_he guard turned her away. Spence was three degrees removed from a Defense Department civilian at the airport. At sunset she sent his photo to Hawa and told her to look for him. Hours went by. /T_hen, after midnight, he emerged from the gate\u2014a middle-aged American in civilian clothes, with salt-and-pepper hair and a black mustache. /T_he women shouted, \"FTPs! FTPs!\" T wo-thirds of the group made it inside, including Hawa and her sister. But when the crowd saw so many women getting through, it grew angry and blocked the others, including the ones with small children farther back. It was 2:30/uni00A0a.m. on August 19. /T_he ordeal had lasted almost 24 hours. \"Came in very hard,\" Hawa reported to Spence. /T_hey had come in hard, and the others would have to be brought in later. But the operation had been a success. Spence would try to repeat it for other military women in the coming week and meet nothing but failure after failure. VI. THE DAMNED AND THE SA VED \"By and large, what we have found is that people have been able to get to the airport,\" Jake Sullivan told the White House press corps a few hours before Hawa left her house. \"In fact, very large numbers of people have been able to get to the airport and present themselves.\" Sullivan acknowl-edged that the Afghan government had fallen in spite of the Biden administration's decision to show support by refusing calls for early evacuations. He blamed the decision on bad advice from the Afghan government. \"What you can do is plan for all contingencies,\" he said. \"We did that.\"Biden also pointed a /f_inger at the Afghans. In a televised speech the day after Kabul fell, he blamed the lack of early evacuations on the Ghani government and SIVs who \"did not want to leave earlier.\" He blamed Afghan troops for failing to defend their country, even though the monthly toll of those killed in action reached its highest level in years after his withdrawal announcement. \"We gave them every chance to determine their own future. What we could not provide them was the will to /f_ight for that future.\" His words, spoken at the very moment when Afghans were trying to escape with their lives, were chilling. Biden had revised the deadline for the troop with- drawal to August/uni00A031, and he imposed the same deadline on the evacuation. Now the administration acted with the urgency that it had failed to show since April. A total of 5,000 troops were sent to Kabul, along with two dozen State Department consular ocers. /T_he U.S. government's priority was to evacuate American citizens and green-card holders /f_irst, then SIVs and other \"at-risk Afghans.\" But the government, having failed to plan for an evacuation on this scale, didn't know who those Afghans were, where to /f_ind them, or how to get them into the airport. Events were moving so fast that a paratrooper I talked with who arrived the weekend Kabul fell expected to go straight into a /f_ire/f_ight with Talibs, while a Marine who landed two or three days later considered the Tali-ban \"an adjacent friendly unit.\" /T_he paratrooper soon realized that the most important tool of the mission was his phone. Texts poured in from friends back home, all asking for help getting Afghans they knew into the air-port. In the /f_irst few days the paratrooper thought that a prioritized system of entry for each category of evacuees would soon be in place at assigned gates. He heard of plans to create safe areas around Kabul where U.S. forces could collect people and ferry them to the airport. But such a system was never created. With each day the chaos at the gates only grew. He learned details of the madness on the other side of the wall from people thousands of miles away who were in minute-by-minute contact with Afghans trying to get in. \"It's an absolute gut wrenching shit show,\" the para- trooper texted his friend Sam Ayres. Ayres connected the paratrooper with Julie Kornfeld, who sought information for Khan and her other clients about /f_lights, paperwork, and gates. But there was no consistent information to give. Everything depended on an Afghan getting to a gate, a guard being in the right place at the right time, the gate staying open long enough for the Afghan to be pulled through. And it never worked the same way twice. 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 78 1/17/2022 5:27:24 PM78 /seven.taboldstyle/nine.taboldstyleTHE BETRAYAL B Y G E O R G E P A C K E R /T_he paratrooper's ocial job was to get U.S. mat\u00e9riel and personnel out of Afghanistan. He and other troops spent every spare waking hour\u2014and they barely slept\u2014/f_ielding texts and working on what they called \"recover-ies.\" To help them identify certain Afghans in the mob, the troops asked for photos, or identifying garments such as red scarves, or call-and-response passwords: \"Detroit\"-\"Red paratrooper argued with consular ocers who wanted to send people back out of the airport for lack of paperwork. \"SIV to me meant nothing, because that thing will take 24 months,\" he said. \"What, are we going to expect them to get on Wi-Fi and /f_ill out a quick applica-tion on State.gov while they're waiting outside the gate? 'You washed dishes at the embassy\u2014you're in.' \" Most of the paratrooper's activity was unocial. /T_he chain of command almost certainly knew, could have stopped it, and would have done so if the troops had made serious mistakes. So they were careful not to venture too far outside the gate\u2014less out of fear for their safety than worry that a /f_ire/f_ight with a Talib would shut the whole thing down. Just inside the perimeter, consular ocers had to make instant decisions about whom to admit, torn between their /f_luctuating rules and the human faces in front of them. /T_hough State Department ocials from around the world had volunteered to go to Kabul, only 40 consular ocers were on hand to deal with the huge /f_low at the airport. On August/uni00A019 John Bass, a former ambassador to Afghanistan, arrived to oversee the evacuation. His top priority was getting American citizens, green-card hold-ers, and Afghan embassy sta into the airport. Talibs kept blocking entry for some evacuees and shutting down gates when the crowds became unmanageable; the Americans also closed gates when they received intelligence about terror threats. Bass resorted to using unmarked gates to avoid the crowds at the public ones; at times, to keep this ocial evacuation going, he had to refuse entry to groups of Afghans who were part of the unocial eort. When Representatives Seth Moulton and Peter Meijer made an unannounced visit on August/uni00A024, two senior diplomats broke down in tears and told Moulton they were \"completely overwhelmed.\" Children and parents lost each other. T roops saw children trampled underfoot. A Marine saw a Talib knife a boy who was climbing over a wall. A tear-gas canister struck the side of an 8-year-old girl's face, melting her skin. A new mother staggered through the gate with her baby, who had just died, sobbing so hard that she threw up on the shoes of a consular ocer checking documents. By the East Gate, a stack of corpses baked in the sun for hours. Outside the North Gate, the crushed bodies of four babies /f_loated in a river of sewage. To avoid the besieged gates, U.S. troops brought women and children over the 16-foot blast wall using ladders under cover of darkness. /T_hey paid Afghan paramilitaries and even American Marine guards in cigarettes to let people through. /T_hey had to make up their own priority list and /f_ind imme-diate grounds for saying yes or no to the immense volume of equal desperation on their phones: military women, then interpreters, then male commandos, then embassy sta. Women, but not men; families, but no children over 15. \"It's an awful thing to make a decision about,\" one soldier told me. Many of the troops quickly realized that escorting a newly orphaned child onto a plane to a new life would be the most important mission of their lives. \"/T_his is going to be our legacy,\" the paratrooper said, \"whether we do two years in the Army, or 20 years, or 40 years.\" /K.sc/h.sc/a.sc/n.sc /w.sc/a.sc/s.sc /e.sc/x.sc/p.sc/e.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc a State Department email that would tell him when to go to the airport and where, but it never came. (No SIVs received speci/f_ic instructions like this throughout the evacuation.) Kornfeld was trying to get him on a /f_light, military or commercial. On Monday, August/uni00A016, he went with Mina and their son to the North Gate. /T_hey spent all day in the sun, unable to get past the Taliban /f_ighters and the crowd of thousands. Khan saw that all kinds of people were trying to escape\u2014ordinary shopkeepers, young men without even a national-identity card\u2014while Afghans like him, who had checked every box, couldn't get inside. At one point Mina was pushed to the ground. She was afraid she would miscarry. /T_he next day Khan returned by himself, but Talibs with guns and horsewhips kept him from getting anywhere close. Before dawn on August/uni00A018, the family tried again. Khan had all of 500 afghanis\u2014about $6\u2014in his pocket. /T_hey left small travel bags with a food peddler and, with just biscuits and water, their documents hidden under Mina's clothes, they waded into the crowd at the North Gate as the sun was coming up over the Hindu Kush mountains. /T_hey decided that they would stay at the air-port until they got out or died. Talibs were /f_iring in the air, and several of them kicked Khan and beat him with ri/f_le butts and a lead pipe. His son screamed at the sight of the men with long hair and beards. Mina kept encouraging her husband, telling him not to lose hope. They abandoned the North Gate and walked for almost an hour along the airport perimeter to the Abbey Gate, on the southeast side. Here the troops were British and Canadian, and the family wasn't allowed through. 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 79 1/17/2022 5:27:24 PM wife!\" Kornfeld texted. \"Say she's in labor!\" It was no use. /T_he family continued their odyssey until they arrived at the South Gate, the main entrance. Here there were U.S. Marines, but also thousands of Afghans. \"Less than 300 have valid docs,\" Khan texted. \"All the looters and others came.\" It was almost noon. His phone rang. When he answered, an unfamiliar voice spoke his full name. \"We found your number on your work desk. You supported the Americans. You dis-tributed weapons and ammunition.\" \"You have the wrong number,\" \"I'm a uni- versity student in Khost.\" \"No. We know who you are.\" /T_here was no time to be unnerved, with the gun/f_ire and tear gas and people running and falling. Mina kept getting squeezed, but she wanted to hold their posi-tion and refused to let Khan pull her out of the crush. /T_heir son, in Khan's arms, was so traumatized by the Talibs that he kept /f_lailing at his father. Suddenly the Marines were /f_iring warning shots and /f_lash-bangs to disperse the crowd; people ran in every direction, and the way to the checkpoint was clear. Khan saw his chance and rushed forward. Mina cried out not to be left behind, but he kept going. /T_hrough the smoke Khan saw the /f_igure of an older man in civilian clothes and body armor.

Spence relied on one particularly resourceful trooper in the airport who made the Afghan women his priority, bringing them in over ladders, darting outside the fence to grab a husband separated from his wife, a son from his mother. An attempted helicopter rescue that Spence helped arrange through a Pentagon contact failed on two successive nights. A few women gave up trying and /f_led by car to Mazar-i-Sharif or Pakistan. And all the while hundreds of others Spence didn't know, regular army women who had heard about her from the FTPs, were imploring her through her phone. \"At /f_irst I said yes to everyone,\" she told me. \"/T_hen I started to say no to men; to people without docs; to people with docs but not for their families; to people writ-ing me really long messages, because I didn't have time to read them. If it was a single woman, I would be more apt to talk to them. And then it was, honestly\u2014it's really terrible\u2014 if a photo spoke to me, if their words spoke to me, if their English was good, if I sensed this person would be responsive and could get their stu together.\" She called it \"a really terrible Sophie 's Choice situation.\" Spence's Army boss allowed her to stay o the base until August/uni00A031. She sat in her living room alone with her phone, sleeping one or two hours a night, eating whatever she had in the cupboard, losing 15 pounds. When Hawa was trying to get into the airport Spence threw up from exhaustion and stress, then felt annoyed because she didn't have time to throw up. Once, she looked outside and was startled to see a palm tree. She had thought she was in Kabul. Others working on evacuations around the clock from a Washington suburb or upstate New York had the same hallucinatory experience. Everyone sensed that the window was closing. On August/uni00A024, the Taliban announced that only U.S.-passport and green-card holders would be allowed near the airport. /T_he U.S. government was going to limit its eorts to the same group. /T_he evacuation of Afghans appeared to be ending after just one week. /T.sc/h.sc/e.sc /d.sc/i.sc/f.sc/f.sc/e.sc/r.sc/e.sc/n.sc/c.sc/e.sc /b.sc/e.sc/t.sc/w.sc/e.sc/e.sc/n.sc the damned and the saved came down to three factors. /T_he /f_irst was character\u2014 resourcefulness, doggedness, will. /T_he second was what Afghans call wasita\u2014connections. /T_he third, and most important, was sheer luck. Najeeb Monawari possessed character and connections, but his ordeal suggested that a malign fate was working against him. He tried to get into the airport with his fam-ily four times through four gates and failed each time. Many of his relatives worked for the Afghan security forces, which controlled a \"hidden\" gate on the northwest side, but Panj shiris had lost their power overnight, and his relatives were unable to do anything. At the North Gate, Afghan guards\u2014Pashtuns from an intelligence unit in Jalalabad\u2014 were letting in their ethnic relatives while jeer- ing \"T raitors!\" at northerners like Monawari. At the Abbey Gate, when he took a picture of the crowd to show his Green Beret friends, an armed Talib grabbed him by the shirt and began dragging him o.

If he uttered a word they would know he was Panjshiri and kill him on the spot. \"/T_his motherfucker took a picture of women!\" the Talib told the boss's bodyguard. \"/T_he boss is busy now,\" the bodyguard said. \"Take his phone.\" Monawari tried to open his phone, but his /f_ingers kept mistyping the passcode. He /f_inally managed to get it open. He deleted the picture. And then he took o, into the crowd, away from the gate, pulling o the white scarf that made him noticeable, soon losing his pursuers. He found his family and said, \"Let's go home.\" By the morning of August 19, Monawari and his wife and three kids were exhausted. His mother was alternately praying and berating him for coming back to Kabul. His phone rang: It was Larry Ryland, the Green Beret weapons sergeant. Ryland, who lived outside Houston, where he ran a military-contracting business, was in a rage at the failure to get his interpreter into the airport and out of Afghanistan. He was considering traveling to Qatar and appropriating a small turboprop plane to personally evacu-ate Monawari. \"If anybody deserved it, it was him and his family,\" Ryland told me. \"Dude, he was probably one of the top-/f_ive people in the world I'd trust.\" Ryland was calling with a new plan. It depended on his contacts in the Special Forces world, who had eyes on Monawari from a \"satellite country.\" /T_hey set up a route for him to get to the airport, with Afghans positioned along the way to create a diversion in case there was trou-ble at a Taliban checkpoint. /T_he Special Forces operators connected Ryland with a U.S. soldier on the inside, who would come out for Monawari at a speci/f_ic moment. /T_he plan also involved congressional letterhead. One of Monawari's colleagues in Doctors Without Borders was the niece of Jim Coyle, the president of a New Jersey chamber of commerce, who in turn knew Representative Malinowski. Coyle asked Malinowski to sign a letter of support for Monawari's entry into the airport. \"/T_his letter is completely irregular and contrary to established proce-dures,\" the congressman replied. \"/T_herefore I will be happy to sign it!\" /T_he letter and Ryland's word were enough to make Monawari\u2014a rejected SIV applicant\u2014the priority for the soldier inside the airport. But the gate names were confusing, and the grid coor- dinates were slightly o, and Monawari and his family showed up in the wrong spot. /T_here was no American looking for a letter from Malinowski. /T_hen the soldier called Monawari and told him to go as fast as he could a mile east to another gate and look for a soft hat held high on a baton. A mile! /T_hey ran, and with the running and his children crying and a dehydration headache coming on he was too tired to answer the calls that kept coming\u2014if he answered, he feared, he would take his last breath and die. At the second gate there was no phone signal, and no sol-dier holding a soft hat high on a baton. /T_hen the hat and the soldier were there, 50 feet away, across the concertina wire, in front of the Hesco bags, and Monawari pushed his family through the crowd that grew denser and denser near the wire until he reached the barbed coils and his kids were gone\u2014they must have fallen underfoot, trampled, if they weren't crying it meant they were dead, and he opened his mouth to yell but he couldn't make a sound, couldn't say that he'd come back to Kabul and done everything in his power to reach this place and now it had all turned to shit, they were gone, there was no reason to leave, and he started punching wildly to get people o his children. \"Your kids are here,\" a Marine said. Another Marine was carrying his 9-year-old girl over the wire. Monawari grabbed her younger sister, and as he lifted her, a Marine pulled him forward and he fell, the wire making a deep cut in his thumb. /T_hen they were brought through an opening between the Hesco bags into the airport. Planes were waiting on the runway, with people standing in long lines. Immediately the pain of his headache and gashed thumb disappeared, and he was overcome with happiness. In July Monawari had applied for Canadian immigra- tion. At the airport he discovered that he had a choice: He could /f_ly out with most of the other departing Afghans on a U.S. C-17 to Qatar. Or he could board an earlier Canadian military /f_light through Kuwait to Canada. He had waited 10 years for a U.S. visa\u2014would his family have to wait another year in Qatar? He had always wanted to be an American. He now owed his life to American friends and strangers who had used every means to bring his family to safety. But Monawari didn't want to wait any longer. He would become a Canadian. On August 25, in Toronto, he received an email from a U.S. State Department ocial. \"I want to apologize for the delay in response time and process,\" it said. \"I want to assure you that we are working around the clock to help address these delays for applicants such as yourself during this very dicult time.\" /T_he ocial reported that the U.S. embassy had approved him for a Special Immigrant Visa.

After that, the chance for Afghans to get out dwindled quickly toward zero. VII. HONOR /T_he United States government estimates that it airlifted 124,000 people from Afghanistan before the last troops /f_lew out on August 30, a day ahead of Biden's deadline. /T_his total\u2014which surprised many of those who struggled night and day to get a family of /f_ive through a gate\u2014counted everyone who left Hamid Karzai International Airport: the 45,000 on private and non-U.S. aircraft, as well as approximately 2,000 U.S.-embassy personnel, 5,500 American citizens, 2,000 citizens of NATO coun-tries, 3,300 citizens of other countries, 2,500 SIVs and family members, and 64,000 \"at-risk Afghans,\" including the many thousands who found a way into the airport regardless of status or threat. /T_he Biden administration declared the evacuation a historic triumph. /T_he achievement belonged mainly to the troops and civilians who worked tirelessly at the airport, and to the ordinary people who worked tirelessly overseas on Whats-App and Signal, and above all to the courage, borne of mortal panic and tenacious hope, of the Afghans who lost everything. Without the unocial evacuation eorts, many of them funded by private citizens, the number would have been far lower. But no one who took part described it as a success. /T_he constant emotions of those days and nights at the airport were frustration and heartbreak. Human Rights First estimates that 90/uni00A0percent of SIVs\u2014including some with visas in hand\u2014were left behind with their families. /T_he number of Afghans who remain in danger because of their association with the 20-year American presence in their country must be counted in the hundreds of thousands. By the end of August, Alice Spence and Sam Ayres and their colleagues had evacuated 145 military women and family members. /T_hey still had a list of 87 people whom they couldn't get out. After August/uni00A031, the list would continue to grow. \"I can't even contemplate what I'm going to have to say to these women,\" Ayres told his paratrooper friend. \"Everyone wants to the leadership,\" the paratrooper texted Ayres on August/uni00A027. Many troops felt that they'd left the mission un/f_inished. During the /f_inal hours at the airport, one soldier received 120 calls for help. \"People are talking about the greatest airlift in history,\" he said, \"when in reality it was a complete clusterfuck and a lot of people died that didn't need to.\" Ambassador Bass, who oversaw the evacuation, left Afghanistan deeply proud of his colleagues' eorts, he told me, but also \"haunted\" by the number of people who didn't get out. \"I really felt just this enormous sense of regret.\" Administration ocials told me that no one could have anticipated how quickly Kabul would fall. /T_his is true, and it goes for both Afghans and Americans. But the failure to plan for a worst-case scenario while there was time, during the spring and early summer, as Afghanistan began to collapse, led directly to the fatal chaos in August. /T_he Taliban gave every indication of wanting to cooperate with the American withdrawal, partly because it hoped for a continued diplomatic presence. \"/T_hey're still asking us today, 'Why did you leave?' \" a senior ocial told me. But the administration never tried to negotiate a better way out with the Taliban, didn't establish green zones in Kabul and other cities with air/f_ields. Instead, the evacua-tion came down to 10 days and one runway. /T_he end was always going to be messy. But through its failures, the administration dramatically compressed the evacuation in both time and space. It created a panic to squeeze perishable human beings through the dangerous openings of a fortress before they closed forever. It left the burdens to a 20-year-old infantryman trying not to make eye contact with a mother standing in sewage; to an Afghan woman choosing which sister to save; to an Army captain alone in her faraway house. \"/T_here are a number of truths about the war that this evacuation yielded,\" Ayres told me, \"and one of them is that shortsightedness and failures at the top created slack that had to be taken up by the men and women on the ground\u2014by the Marines on the perimeter, by the families that couldn't get through the crush of the crowds.\" Mike Breen, of Human Rights First, told me that the adminis-tration \"took the life-and-death decisions that 1/17/2022 5:27:27 PM /eight.taboldstyle/three.taboldstyle/eight.taboldstyle/four.taboldstyleMARCH 2022 THE ATLANTIC been at the highest level of the government and sent them down to the lowest level, which is a pretty good metaphor for the whole war.

George Soros and Glenn Beck both sponsored charter /f_lights. T rump-supporting veterans worked with Democratic members of Congress, and liberal journalists sought help from Republican Hill staers. /T_he quickest way to get kicked o a group chat was to make a political point. But an event as big as the fall of Kabul inevitably absorbed the poison of Ameri-can politics. Early in the evacuation, a /f_lock of progres-sive pundits suddenly all /f_lew in the same direction and accused the administration's critics of using the crisis as an excuse to keep the war going forever. /T_his same talk-ing point had emerged during the White House's mes-saging campaign earlier in the summer. It shifted the argument from Afghanistan to the Washington foreign-policy \"blob,\" as if the latter were the really important battleground. /T_hose taking the brunt of the catastrophe were women and girls, members of religious and sexual minorities, civil-society activists, all of them people of color\u2014groups that progressive pundits are supposed to care about. /T_he end of the war was the /f_irst test of a new foreign policy based on human rights rather than mili-tary force. /T_he administration and its defenders failed it. The hypocrisy on the right was worse. Republican members of Congress and media /f_igures heaped scorn on the Biden administration for a withdrawal policy that it had inherited from the T rump administration, then fomented outrage over Afghan refugees on U.S. military bases and in American towns. Biden's political advisers had not been wrong to think that Republicans would try to exploit the issue to stir up xenophobia. But across the country, ordinary Americans rushed to embrace the arriving refugees. /T_hey left bundles of clothes and baskets of food at the gates of the military bases where the refugees were housed. /T_hey volunteered their com-munities, even their homes, for resettlement: in Houston, where Khan, Mina, their son, and their new American daughter now live; in Spokane, Washington, Hawa's choice for her new home as she seeks a chance to enlist in the U.S. military. A woman in Denver wrote to me: \"When we posted on our neighborhood's [Facebook] page on a Wednesday that an Afghan refugee family with children would be staying with us starting in 2 days we had 100s of items of clothes, toys, toiletries, baby gear, and winter gear show up on our porch, in addition to a job oer and dental services for the family. People I didn't even know were dropping o donations with promises of more to come. People want to help!\" It was as if Americans were seeking some way to feel better about their country. /T_he evacuation eort drew on a similar longing. It ran especially strong in the generation of Americans whose adult lives were shaped by the 9/11 wars\u2014who experi-enced a kind of personal crisis at the way the era ended. \"What I wanted out of this was to salvage a little bit of honor from this whole debacle,\" Ayres told me. \"Every person we got out, I'd be able to look back on my service and my experience with slightly more pride.\" Months after the end of the August evacuation, Ayres, Spence, and their colleagues are still working day and night to save Afghan allies, many of them women. Some are hiding in safe houses and selling their furniture to feed their children. After years of drought, and the economic collapse that followed the Taliban victory, Afghanistan has descended into a winter of starvation. Spence receives hun-dreds of messages a day from Afghans telling her that she is their only hope for rescue from the Taliban and hunger. One of the women on Spence's list is Hamasa Parsa, the soldier-writer who dreamed of dead /f_lowers the night before Kabul fell. A friend gave her a number for Spence, who responded within 10 minutes. Parsa spends her days at home caring for her younger brothers and sisters, and limits the family to two meals a day. When she ventures out she fears being denounced by a neighbor, or forced by the Taliban into marriage. One day in November she went out fully covered to buy a phone charger. A Talib was in the store, weapon slung over his shoulder, play-ing the video game Ludo King on his phone. Suddenly he looked at Parsa. \"It was my /f_irst time in my life that I looked into the eye of a Talib,\" she told me. She gasped, and her hand trembled. /T_he Talib smiled, as if to say, You're scared of me, right? A man keeps calling Parsa's phone. She knows him from her old oce at the Ministry of Defense. He tells her to bring in the gun that she was issued, and she answers that she doesn't have a gun, though her family has buried it in their yard, along with military documents. /T_he summons is a trap. She no longer trusts anyone. For the /f_irst time, she /f_inds writing impossible. \"I just don't know what will be the end,\" she told me. \"/T_hat scares me. I want to /f_ind a happy ending for my book /f_irst.\" Recently, Spence told Parsa that it will be at least half a year before she has a chance to get out. /T_he U.S. government is not making it easy. It is charter- ing /f_lights out of Kabul for SIV holders and of high 0322_WEL_Packer_Afghanistan [Print]_15896151.indd 84 1/17/2022 5:27:27 PM84 /eight.taboldstyle/five.taboldstyleTHE BETRAYAL B Y G E O R G E P A C K E R priority, but the eort is so sluggish, and the rules for authorizing passengers so onerous, that State Department ocials have turned to private groups for help evacuating Afghans they know. At the same time, the department is reluctant to negotiate landing rights in other countries for private charters. Before Afghans can apply for the priority refugee program they must somehow get out of Afghani-stan, but the U.S. government won't help them leave. /T_he most direct way to bring at-risk Afghans to the U.S. is through a program called humanitarian parole; at least 35,000 Afghans have applied, for a fee of $575 each, but the Department of Homeland Security is processing the backlog neither quickly nor generously. \"/T_he State Department always insists that we have to play by the rules,\" Representative Malinowski, who once served in it, told me. /T_he department celebrates Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who forged passports to save Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust. \"But if any State Department employee tried to pull what Raoul Wallenberg did, he'd be /f_ired in three seconds.\" /T_his was the thinking of the period before the August evacuation. \"And then, for two glorious weeks, we threw out the rules.\" Now the department is back to its risk-averse, pre-August thinking, with an obstacle for every human need. \"Bureau-cracy is killing more people than the Taliban,\" Mary Beth Goodman, the State Department ocial, told me. To Spence it seems as if the U.S. government has moved on. \"Afghanistan keeps descending into hell, and what are people like us supposed to do?\" she asked. \"Are we supposed to leave these people who helped Americans, including people we served with personally, behind? I'm a very idealistic person in some ways, and I understand we can't save everyone, and there are crises everywhere. But there was a 20-year war, and that changed a lot of people here. A lot of people served and went there. Our policy, our money, went there. Do we just abandon the people? I don't think that's who we are as a country.

SHORT / HBO MARCH 2022A glut of new roles offer the chance not to be pigeon- holed as \"the wife\" or \"the mom\"\u2014or conversely, the career woman free of domestic responsibilities. Hallelujah! In the past /f_ive years alone, /T_hompson has played a High Court judge in /T_he Children Act, an uptight television host in Late Night , and the British prime minister (twice). /T_hompson had experienced what we might call \"the dry decade.\" /T_he midlife plight of women in Holly wood was immortalized in an Amy Schumer sketch that achieved instant cult status when it aired six years ago. /T_hree actresses are enjoying a picnic in a wooded glade, celebrating one of their number's \"Last Fuckable Day.\" /T_he women around the table\u2014 Patricia Arquette, Tina Fey, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2014 are all attractive, smart, and funny. But that doesn't matter. /T_hey're over the hill in Hollywood's eyes. Fey notes that eventually, women realize that the poster for their movie is \"just, like, a picture of a kitchen.\" Louis-Dreyfus adds that such /f_ilms have \"these very uplifting and yet vague titles, like Whatever It T akes or She Means Well .\" In 2012, two economists from Clemson Univer- sity analyzed the gender balance of American /f_ilms from 1920 to 2011 and oered a more wonkish take on the phenomenon. Overall, they found that men accounted for two-thirds of all roles in mainstream movies. For starring roles, however, age is everything. At 20, women play four-/f_ifths of leads: Hollywood is very interested in them at their nubile prime. Fast- forward to 40, and that statistic is reversed. Men utterly dominate the juiciest parts. /T_he male-female gender split then hovers around 80-20 until, well, death. For the few women actors who come out the other side of the dry decade, the rewards can be mixed. No longer able to portray ingenues, brides-to-be, or manic pixie dream girls, or be the Avengers' diversity hire (sorry, Black Widow), older actresses graduate into the other popular category open to women: hags and harpies. Meryl Streep once described the parts she was oered after 50 as women who were \"gorgons or dragons or in some way grotesque.\" Sure enough, /T_hompson's late-career roles also include the Baron-ess in Cruella, Goneril in a TV-movie version of King Lear, and Miss T runchbull in the upcoming musical adaptation of Matilda . Monsters, one and all. But biology, it turns out, needn't be destiny. A new generation of actresses has discovered an answer to the dry decade, and is showing the rest of us what we've been missing\u2014stories that capture the fullness of women's lives. /T.sc/o.sc /u.sc/n.sc/d.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc the problem (and because the experience is always pleasant), consider Tom Hanks. He might be \"America's Dad,\" but his career repre-sents a type of ageless versatility long aorded by the /f_ilm industry\u2014to male actors. In his 30s, Hanks wooed Elizabeth Perkins in Big, Meg Ryan in Sleepless in Seattle , and Robin Wright in Forrest Gump . (I am excluding Beasley, the dog from Turner & Hooch, from this analysis, though IMDb sadly records that Beasley never worked again.) Hanks's next decade was anything but dry. In his 40s, he played an FBI agent in Catch Me If You Can, a Mob enforcer in Road to Perdition, Woody in Toy Story, and a man stranded on a deserted island in Cast Away, among other roles. But what about his female co-stars? /T_heir 40s were not exactly dazzling. At 41, Meg Ryan jettisoned her sweet, goofy image in In the Cut, playing an Eng- lish teacher drawn into a sexual relationship with a potential serial killer. /T_he critical reception dwelled on the /f_ilm's erotic atmosphere, and Ryan's onscreen nudity was greeted as an unwelcome surprise. She has since said that the /f_ilm marked a \"turning point\" from which her career never re covered. Neither Elizabeth Perkins nor Robin Wright fared well in the /f_ilm industry, either. But they did have success elsewhere\u2014and this is where the story of the dry decade takes an intriguing turn. Perkins spent her mid-to-late 40s on Showtime's Weeds , as the lead character's narcissist neighbor, Celia\u2014and earned three Emmy nominations for the role. At 46, Wright started playing Claire Underwood in House of Cards , and by the /f_inal season had graduated from /f_irst lady to president. Perkins and Wright were among the /f_irst wave of women to bene/f_it from the golden age of television. Since then, the streaming wars have created a huge demand for new dramas, and the increased oppor-tunities are obvious. In her 40s, Reese Witherspoon has starred in Big Little Lies, Little Fires Everywhere, and /T_he Morning Show . (As a bonus, the last of these also rescued Jennifer Aniston from a /f_ilm industry that never quite seemed to know what to do with her.) /T_he HBO remake of Scenes From a Marriage gave 44-year-old Jessica Chastain a role every bit as challenging as an Ibsen heroine. At 46, Sandra Oh began playing a weary spy locked in a deadly pas de deux with a glamorous assassin in Hulu's Killing Eve . And at the same age, Kate Winslet undertook one of the standout roles of her career, as Mare Sheehan, the stoic detective in HBO's Mare of Easttown . /C.sc/o.sc/m.sc/p.sc/a.sc/r.sc/e.sc/d.sc /w.sc/i.sc/t.sc/h.sc the dead ends that Ryan, Per- kins, and Wright encountered in traditional Holly-wood, the trajectory for female stars is thriving on the competition among HBO, Amazon, Apple, Net/f_lix, and others.

Originally intended for Tom Cruise, the script was rewritten for its eventual star, Angelina Jolie. /T_hat entailed one big change: Edwin Salt was a parent; Evelyn Salt was not. \"If a woman had a child, I think it would be very hard for us not to imagine her kind of holding on to that child through the entire /f_ilm,\" Jolie said at the time. \"Which is strange\u2014but I think audiences would allow a man to have a child and the child [could] be with the wife back at home.\" (When making Salt, Jolie herself was a working mother of six children, including 2-year-old twins.) Television series are hungry for plotlines, and their cast lists spread like tree roots as seasons progress, giving women new room to grow. In stark contrast to the narrowness of Jolie's role in Salt, Keri Russell transitioned from her late 30s into her 40s as Elizabeth Jennings on /T_he Americans , navigating the identities of mother, travel agent, and Soviet spy. In /T_he Queen's Gambit, deft touches /f_illed out the portrait of Beth Harmon's alcoholic adoptive mother, Alma, played by Marielle Heller, who had recently turned 40. In accommodating characters who are mothers, without that being their only identity, television has brought new tensions and texture to established genres. Where male detectives have tended\u2014to the point of clich\u00e9\u2014to be troubled, maverick loners, Olivia Colman's Ellie Miller found her investiga-tions complicated by her own family turmoil and deep links to the local town in the British crime show Broadchurch . Kate Winslet's Mare Sheehan is similarly embedded in her community, at the center of a loving, chaotic, and grieving clan in the kind of suburb where everyone has secrets and everyone is trying to cope: with addiction, with loss, with something as mundane as America's lack of aord-able child care. /T_he wide-angle lens of television invites immersion in a pivotal midlife decade that\u2014for anyone juggling a career, children, and aging parents, as well as their own compromises, regrets, and unful/f_illed ambitions\u2014is anything but dry. \"I always imagined I'd be a cop,\" Mare tells a younger police ocer. \"It's the life around me I didn't expect to fall apart so spectacularly.\" Helen Lewis is a London-based staff writer at The Atlantic and the author of Dicult Women: A His- tory of Feminism [Print]_15884596.indd 88 1/13/2022 11:39:17 AM88Built to Last Our dry-erase wall panels are built tough.

By Jordan KisnerBOOKS Which of the stories do I start with here? /T_here was the time when I was 16 and the teacher of my preprofessional acting workshop decided that I needed to be more physically unselfconscious, that my technique wasn't loose enough. He made me pretend to have a seizure on the /f_loor while the dozen or so other stu-dent actors watched, and wouldn't let me stop convulsing until he said so. I /f_lopped around, my face burning brighter and brighter red while he shouted at me to go harder, to really commit to the seizure, for an endless three minutes. Or maybe the time when I was 20 and a teacher at one of NYU's conservatory acting schools had the tallest, strongest boy in my class hold me tight to his chest and 0322_CC_Kisner_TheMethod [Print]_15888640.indd 90 1/13/2022 11:40:36 AM90 /nine.taboldstyle/one.taboldstyle MARCH 2022not let go. /T_he idea was to get me truly distraught, because my character was upset. \"Get away from him,\" she told me. \"Don't let her go,\" she told him. I tried to escape, shoving, kicking, pulling, heaving, going slack, struggling uselessly and furiously until\u2014 surprising myself\u2014I burst into wracking sobs. \"Good,\" she said. \"Now start the scene.\" /T_he boy let me go and I stumbled through it, unable to stop crying. /T_he performance was deemed a breakthrough, if a little \"uncontrolled\" on my part. T raining to be an actor with any seriousness tends to involve scenarios like these. (I started when I was about 14 and quit abruptly at 22, unable to stom-ach some of the industry conventions, such as being asked at \"cattle calls\" to stand in line for a /f_irst cut based only on appearance.) Actors do strange and sometimes ridiculous things in pursuit of mastery, a fact that they and most audiences take in stride because it is understood that actors are engaged in a somewhat ridiculous, if also completely magical, task: psychologically and physically inhabiting other, usually imaginary people in sometimes quite extreme imaginary situations, on command, while maintain-ing enough of a foothold in reality to revert back to normal whenever they're told to. One can justify all kinds of preparatory exercises in pursuit of a goal this absurd. A teacher once told me and my classmates to squat and imagine that we were breathing in and out of our anuses. I don't remember what the point of that was supposed to be. /T_he idea that an actor must authentically expe- rience and feel the lived reality of the character he is playing\u2014and therefore be in/f_initely present and malleable\u2014 now underpins almost everything that Americans deem to be \"good\" acting. It has given us a century of brilliant performers, acolytes of the so-called Method: Marlon Brando, Dustin Faye Dunaway, Jack Nicholson, Hilary Swank, Leonardo DiCaprio\u2014the list includes most of the great post-1950 actors one can think of. Add to that those who don't explicitly claim to be Method actors but subscribe to its philosophy or use Method techniques: Daniel Day-Lewis, who learned Czech for the adaptation of /T_he Unbear- able Lightness of Being, even though his lines were in English; Frances McDormand, who famously asked someone on set to grab her and not let go, in order to get her panicked for the climax sequence of Blood Simple ; Jeremy Strong, who wanted to be sprayed with real tear gas during the riot scenes of /T_he Trial of the Chicago 7 ; Benedict Cumberbatch, who studied the banjo, learned to use a lasso, and asked that his costumes never get washed while shooting /T_he Power of the Dog ./T.sc/h.sc/e.sc /r.sc/o.sc/o.sc/t.sc/s.sc /o.sc/f.sc /t.sc/h.sc/i.sc/s.sc /a.sc/p.sc/p.sc/r.sc/o.sc/a.sc/c.sc/h.sc, as the direc- tor and theater historian Isaac Butler emphasizes in his new book, /T_he Method: How the Twentieth Cen- tury Learned to Act , are relatively recent. /T_he notion of perezhivanie, or \"living a part,\" was popularized by Konstantin Stanislavski, the Russian actor and director who co-founded the Moscow Art /T_heatre in the 1890s. Along with the older director Vladi-mir Nemirovich-Danchenko, he pushed to supplant a labored, politically in/f_luenced style of acting that had emerged in Russia in response to government censorship. /T_he two men considered it stale and false: Stanislavski took to heart the critic Vissarion Belin-sky's call for art to illuminate the real world \"in all its truth and nakedness.\" Together Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko set out to remake Russian theater in line with Tolstoy's conviction that art was \" 'a means of communion' whose highest goal was to unify humanity,\" Butler writes. Actors would be not simply actors but \"artists, and if artists had a spiri-tual, perhaps even holy, purpose, then acting required intense attention to ethics and discipline.\" /T_heir \"system,\" as Stanislavski called the theory of training he developed over time, posited that the actor's own life is crucial material in the construc-tion of a role with speci/f_icity and emotional verac-ity. Full physical and psychological commitment was required. Actors were encouraged to ask what motivated their character in any given scene\u2014and what their overall \"supertask\" in the play was\u2014and to correlate every line with an action along the road to ful/f_illing that mission. All of the smaller tasks, unfolding in the chronology of the play, created the \"throughline of action.\" /T_hese ideas are now foun-dational to script analysis, whether or not it's under-taken in a Method-acting context. Each character's behavior would also be shaped in its particulars by what Stanislavski referred to as the \"given circumstances,\" such as the scene's environ-ment and era, the character's health and relationships, the immediately preceding events, and so on. /T_he actor should make use of \"aective memory\": /T_he body, emotions, and visceral experi-ences, which can be triggered or, with training, inten-tionally reactivated. (Butler uses the example of a smell or taste reminding you of your parents' kitchen and evoking nostalgia.) Called upon to generate genuine emotions for a scene, aective memory could help produce what Stanislavski called the \"Magic If,\" an imaginative state in which, he wrote, \"the actor passes from the plane of actual reality into the plane of another life, created and imagined by him.\" Lee Strasberg, a Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 and the earliest adapter of Stanislavski's techniques in the United One can justify all kinds of preparatory exercises in pursuit of a goal this absurd. 0322_CC_Kisner_TheMethod [Print]_15888640.indd 91 BLOOMSBURYTHE METHOD: HOW THE TWENTIETH CENTURY LEARNED TO ACT Isaac Butlerthe enthusiastic ferment that pervaded the Group /T_heatre in New York. Co-founded in 1931 by Stras-berg, the director Harold Clurman, and the pro-ducer Cheryl Crawford, the Group counted among its earliest members Stella Adler and Sanford Meis-ner, actors who went on to become famous Method teachers, as well as Elia Kazan, who made his mid-century mark as one of the country's most powerful /f_ilm and theater directors. Driven by a shared pas-sion for Stanislavski's vision\u2014but in con/f_lict about its application\u2014the Group set out to pioneer what it claimed would be the /f_irst distinctly American acting technique. One of the major takeaways of The Method is how ill-de/f_ined and bitterly contested the Method was even among its most famous practitioners. Stras-berg emphasized the psychological approach, using affective- memory exercises and improvisation to surface genuine emotion in an actor. Adler struggled with Strasberg's techniques and, after spending a month studying with Stanislavski in Paris, insisted that Strasberg's methods had little to do with the \"sys-tem.\" She went on to cultivate her own branch of the Method, which focused primarily on getting the actor beyond his own experience and into the \"given circumstances.\" Adler taught that full immersion in the lives of characters demanded intensive research and imagination, not just emotional identi/f_ication. Shaping the embodied presence of a character, work-ing on voice and posture, was more important to her than to Strasberg, who believed physicality would naturally /f_low from emotion. Meisner also became a powerful teacher, ditching aective memory entirely and developing a technique that prized getting the actor \"out of his head.\" He relied on an actor's /f_ierce attention to whatever was happening in the moment to produce spontaneity (the Magic If!), naturalism, and emotional veracity. All were loosely united by an underlying philoso- phy: that \"natural\" behavior was better than \"indi-cating\" (their word for faking, or performing), that an actor's greatest achievement would be to truly experience what the character was experiencing. As for why the Method caught on the way it did in the U.S., Butler notes that its advent coincided with the rise of psychotherapy, suggesting a general interest in psychological exploration and aective emotion. He also brie/f_ly proposes that its ethos of truthful-ness and naturalism met a hunger that marked the mid-century, \"a conviction that there was a truth about American life, a protean muck that had pre-viously been buried deep underground. American acting could help excavate America's soul.\" This postwar vision of theater as exhuming, purging, and cleansing\u2014and of actors as the instruments of that States, embraced the simultaneously ominous and romantic undertones of this philosophy as he cham-pioned his version of it, which became known in the early 1930s as \"the Method\": /T_he profession of acting, the basic art of acting, is a monstrous thing because it is done with the same /f_lesh-and-blood muscles with which you perform ordinary deeds, real deeds. /T_he body with which you make real love is the same body with which you make /f_ictitious love with someone you don't like/uni00A0... In no other art do you have this monstrous thing. He didn't need to make explicit the other side of the \"monstrousness,\" the part that made acting not just worthwhile but a \"holy pursuit.\" If acting asks the actor to be both himself and other, it also asks for transcendence. If acting asks the actor not just to simulate but to conjure, it makes him a kind of occultist, in touch with powers the rest of us can only marvel or quail at. /B.sc/u.sc/t.sc/l.sc/e.sc/r.sc /k.sc/n.sc/o.sc/w.sc/s.sc this duality from the inside, and in his introduction, he sketches both a personal and a critical impulse behind his history of Stanislavski's theories and their evolution into the behemoth that the Method became. As a young man, he was an actor whose attempts at excavating extreme emotion in pur-suit of perezhivanie went sideways: I retreated so deep into the recesses of my own per- sonal darkness that I had trouble emerging/uni00A0... I hated the person I became during rehearsal as the nastiness of the character bled into my own personality, and I was not tough enough to manage the emotions my performance dug into. Disenchanted and unnerved, he quit acting for directing and writing. More than two decades later, the stature of the Method as a \"transformative, revo-lutionary, modernist art movement, one of the Big Ideas of the twentieth century,\" continues to fasci-nate him. \"Like atonality in music/uni00A0... or abstraction in art,\" Butler writes, \" the 'system' and the Method brought forth a new way of conceiving of human experience, one that changed how we look at the world, and at ourselves.\" Butler takes a meticulous, immersive approach, oering a blow-by-blow narrative of the trials, tribu-lations, victories, aairs, and dissolutions of a busy cast of characters and theatrical institutions. Yet the avalanche of detail can be pedantic, and the prom-ise that he will explore the Method's deep social rami/f_ications mostly disappears as he traces the tur-moil in and around the Moscow Art 92 1/13/2022 11:40:37 AM92 earlier, when the critic Belinsky inspired Stanislavski by writing that through theater, we can expunge \"our egoism/uni00A0... We become better persons, better citizens.\" /D.sc/o.sc /w.sc/e.sc /s.sc/t.sc/i.sc/l.sc/l.sc /w.sc/i.sc/s.sc/h.sc to think of theater this way? By the late 20th century, Strasberg, Adler, Meisner, and their ilk were dead, but the Method lived on through the eponymous studios they'd founded and through their famous students, who commanded both Broadway and Hollywood. Butler argues that the Method era began to fade in the '70s, a waning that he blames unconvincingly in his /f_inal chapter on a variety of factors, among them the \"end of the postwar consensus\" (whose consensus?) and politi-cal disenchantment (though a few chapters earlier, political disenchantment was framed as a boon to Method naturalism). With little elaboration, he also cites \"pluralistic academia, with its emphasis on stu-dent choice and individual expression,\" and an ever more atomized and capitalistic society: \"Before, we were bound in common cause\u2014individuals, yes, but part of a society and dedicated to its advancement; we were now to be consumers in a marketplace.\" /T_he upshot, Butler writes, is that the Method has been diluted by other acting styles that don't privi-lege psychological spelunking or total authenticity\u2014 think of the Brat Pack, or Bruce Willis. New acting programs, such as the preeminent one at Juilliard, combined Method training with other, primar-ily classical and British techniques. Now the term Method comes up in popular culture mostly as short-hand for intensity, to signal that an actor personally went through something for a part, or did something truly weird, as when Jared Leto, playing the Joker in Suicide Squad, reportedly sent live rats and dildos to fellow cast members as they /f_ilmed. Butler spends almost no time on the Method's more expansive legacy\u2014the fascinating question of how it /f_iltered into American culture and where it continues to live with us. In tying an actor's soul into the work, the Method created a theater that could feel breathlessly real to audiences. For the actor, it turned craft into a spiritual calling, and the self into an instrument to be used, mined, turned inside out in the name of performance\u2014a type of transfor-mation that can be awe-inspiring to behold, but is easily exploited. /T_he century of the Method's rise saw a theater culture in which directors and instruc-tors became godlike /f_igures, irrefutable prophets with access to the actor's whole psyche. Both Stan-islavski and Strasberg were notoriously rageful and imperious. When an actor resisted their direction, or pushed back after being berated for failing to achieve perezhivanie, they could become explosive and violent, claiming that the artist was insulting the great spiritual work of theater in general. /T_he Method also spawned the phenomenon of actors who go to dangerous extremes in the name of role preparation, like Christian Bale losing a reported 60 pounds for the thriller /T_he Machinist, and Margot Robbie undertaking ice-skating training so grueling that she herniated a disk in her neck to play Tonya Harding. Actors have used the Method as an excuse to use abusive tactics on others. Dustin Homan, playing opposite a young Meryl Streep in Kramer vs. Kramer , slapped her before the cameras were rolling, and taunted her about her partner, who had just died of cancer, to get real tears. But-ler mentions a possible connection to the systemic abuses uncovered by the #MeToo movement, yet skirts broader questions about the cultural impact of equating vulnerability with artistry, and teach-ing audiences to excuse or even glorify the damage done to a performer. I keep thinking about what the Scottish actor Brian Cox, interviewed in a recent New Yorker pro- /f_ile of Jeremy Strong, said of actors trained in the U.S.: \"It's a particularly American disease, I think, this inability to separate yourself o while you're doing the job.\" /T_his is no longer a problem just for professional actors. Anyone with a TikTok or Insta-gram account now mines the self for an audience. In these markets, too, authenticity (or the convincing semblance of it) is prized, encouraging a blurring of arti/f_ice and vulnerability that can be corrosive. In a perversion of the Method ethos, fusing performance with true experience now shows up in American life less as a mode of artistry than as a technique for branding the self to gain visibility, pro/f_it, power. /T_he pleasure of Method-acting training, in my experience, was that it asked you to imagine that you could contain the whole world\u2014that anything that ever happened to anyone might be touchable by you through the careful tuning of your instrument: your body, your mind, your sensibility, and your language. /T_he magnitude of the individual in its possible com-munion (a favorite word of Stanislavski's) with the whole is the promise and peril of acting under that theory. Here there are echoes of another artist with a Big Idea for the 20th century: \"And what I assume you shall assume/uni00A0/ For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\" /T_here's something greedy, viral, and even monstrous about this Whitmanian conviction\u2014but transcendent too. Jordan Kisner is the author of /T_hin Places: Essays From In Between .Now the term Method comes up in popular culture mostly as shorthand for intensity, to signal that an actor personally went through something for a part. 0322_CC_Kisner_TheMethod [Print]_15888640.indd 93 1/13/2022 11:40:38 AM /nine.taboldstyle/three.taboldstyle/nine.taboldstyle/four.taboldstyleCulture & Critics Since the 18th century, the bald eagle has adorned government seals, medals, and currency, standing for integrity, vigilance, and strength. And for most of that time Americans have subjected the birds to slander, torture, and mass slaughter. Davis's most surprising contribution is to show how adulation of the natural world can accelerate its destruction. We came very close to loving the bald eagle to death. /T_hat we didn't\u2014that we spared the species from extinction and even appear to have restored its popula-tion to its pre-republic size\u2014is the source of the book's bouncy optimism. /T_he Bald Eagle is the rare natural history that plays as a comedy. It's a dark comedy, however, because its lessons are not easily transferable to our broader, ongoing ecological catastrophe. /T_he bald eagle is not only a symbol of American might. It is a symbol of American exceptionalism. /D.sc/a.sc/v.sc/i.sc/s.sc /b.sc/e.sc/l.sc/i.sc/e.sc/v.sc/e.sc/s.sc the bald eagle was selected as a national symbol for \"all American\" reasons, but his own evidence suggests that the Founding Fathers cribbed from the Greeks and Romans, as they did their architecture, oratory, and government. /T_hough the bald eagle is endemic to North America, an eagle was Zeus's companion, a messenger of Jupiter, and served as the standard of the Roman legion. Across cultures and millennia, dating back to Mesopota-mia, the eagle has been a dominant heraldic /f_igure; Charlemagne had one, as did Napoleon, and Sala-din's eagle survives in the coats of arms of much of the Arab world. Eagles can be found on the national /f_lags of Mexico, Egypt, and Zambia, among others, a tendency unimpeded by the bird's most prominent symbolic performance, as the swastika-bestriding emissary of the /T_hird Reich. In the earliest years of the American republic, the most signi/f_icant objection to using the bird as a national symbol came from Benjamin Franklin (in private correspondence, he argued that the turkey was \"much more respectable\"), though Davis can-not be sure whether he was kidding. Davis can say with certainty that the idea to use a bald eagle for the great seal came from Charles /T_homson, the secretary of the Continental Congress, though the source of his inspiration, Davis writes, \"is anybody's guess.\" /T_he Bald Eagle is a shaggy dog. It proceeds by the principles of accretion, with no eagle fact, or eagle-adjacent fact, left behind. We learn that Alexis de Tocqueville and other European explorers \"passed by\" places with Eagle in Rock,\" \"Eagle Mountain\"); that Zebulon Pike met Native Americans named Big Eagle, Black Eagle, and War Eagle; that Hudson River painters tended not to depict the bird (\"unclear\" why). Abraham Lin-coln's early supporters called him \"young eagle,\" and BOOKS Loving the Bald Eagle to Death Americans have had a strange way of showing their admiration for this regal creature. By Nathaniel Rich Jack E./uni00A0Davis wants it very clearly understood that a bald eagle cannot, in fact, pluck an infant girl from her carriage, carry her clenched between its talons to its nest, and feed her to its eaglets. Okay? If Davis's plea seems especially plaintive, that's because it contradicts centuries of personal testimony and expert accounts. Alexander Wilson, in his foun-dational American Ornithology (1808-14), described a bald eagle dragging a baby along the ground and /f_lying o with a fragment of her frock. accounts of balds abducting infants, and the 1844 edition of McGuey's Reader, a primer in most American grade schools, told the story of an eagle that deposited a girl in its aerie on top of a rock ledge, amid the blood-spattered bones of previous victims. As recently as 1930, an ornithologist with the Geo-logical Survey refused to rule out baby snatchings in congressional testimony. Davis's defense rests on the /f_inding that a bald eagle's maximum cargo capacity is /f_ive pounds. Although he acknowledges that eagles do /f_ly o with chickens, the /f_ive-pound limit puts most newborns out of range. Still, in fairness to Wil-son, Nuttall, and McGuey, it should be noted that the average female birth weight in the 19th century was barely over six pounds. Why did Americans nearly drive America's bird to extinction? In /T_he Bald Eagle , Davis, who won a Pulit- zer Prize for /T_he Gulf, a clever history of \"America's Sea,\" has written a double biography: a history of the species and a history of the symbol. Until recently, the two birds have been complete strangers to each other. MARCH 2022LIVERIGHTTHE BALD EAGLE: THE IMPROBABLE JOURNEY OF AMERICA'S BIRD & Critics vigor, energy, and longevity. Eagles were \"not in their ways inferior, only so in the human mind.\" It took bravery to write this, in his time. Conventional wisdom followed the judgments of Audubon\u2014\"the premier avian slaughterer of his time,\" as the writer Joy Williams has described him\u2014 who comes across as a bloodthirsty monster, even by the standards of his age. Audubon wrote loathingly of eagles and did not miss an opportunity to murder them. Davis relates Audubon's satisfaction at shoot-ing a female while she sat warming her eggs, and the agonized shrieks of a female buzzing overhead while Audubon and his men tortured her spouse. \"No animal in American history,\" Davis writes, \"has to the same extreme been the simultaneous object of reverence and recrimination.\" And no indi-vidual bird embodied both extremes better than Old Abe, who was born in Wisconsin at the outbreak of the Civil War. Before he was old enough to /f_ledge, an Ojibwa chief chopped down his roosting tree, killing his lone sibling, and fought o his parents. /T_he chief traded Abe to a tavern owner for a bushel of corn. A company of Union soldiers adopted Abe as a mascot and inducted him into service, draping his neck in ribbons of red, white, and blue. Old Abe posed for photographs, signed auto- graphs, and was brought into battle. He learned how to dance to a /f_iddle, shake hands with a talon, and kill chickens on command. His symbolic power crossed enemy lines: Confederate soldiers vowed \"to take that Eagle dead or alive.\" In a bid for poetic justice, he tried to escape after his tether was severed by a Mini\u00e9 ball; he /f_lew 50 feet before his handler, racing through gun/f_ire, recaptured him. He was shot twice, but the bullets \"did little more than rue his feathers.\" (Davis has a prodigious weakness for clich\u00e9s, particu-larly birdy ones.) Generals Grant and Sherman raised their hats when Old Abe passed, and P ./uni00A0T./uni00A0Barnum oered $20,000 to adopt him. After the war, Old Abe was incarcerated in the basement of Wisconsin's capitol, where his wings were routinely clipped. Neglected by his caretak-ers, he almost starved to death, before dying from smoke inhalation in a /f_ire. His corpse was mounted, displayed in a glass box, and incinerated in another fire. Davis makes the subtle but persuasive point that the ubiquity of eagles in American culture\u2014on newspaper mastheads, condensed-milk cans, and athletic uniforms\u2014made individual animals seem expendable. With so many cartoon eagles around, who needed the real cackling thing? By the begin-ning of the 20th century, balds had gone missing in so much of the country that Americans believed the species was native to the Rocky Mountains\u2014perhaps one of the higher peaks, up in the clouds.Bill Clinton's Secret Service code name was \"Eagle.\" An etymological debate about whether bald refers to the whiteness of the eagle's head, its piebald coloring, or the word's secondary de/f_inition as \"brazen\" also ends without verdict. From the trivia, however, emerges a moving portrait of a species victimized for its own evolu-tionary successes. /T_he bald is intelligent enough to pursue a life of crime, supplementing its hunting by mugging ospreys as they /f_ly /f_ish back to their nest. Other birds engage in kleptoparasitism, but the violent glory of the bald's midair robberies earned it a reputation for laziness and immorality. Its mania-cal cackle (an \"awful scream,\" John James Audubon described it) did not help. When eagles were /f_irst featured in sound motion pictures, editors dubbed in the call of a red-tailed hawk to avoid unsettling viewers, something like an avian Singin ' in the Rain. Bald eagles are unusually devoted spouses and par- ents. /T_hey mate for life and tend not to move homes unless forced to, which makes them easy marks for hunters. /T_heir tendency to hatch only two eaglets per clutch made them especially vulnerable to egg snatch-ings (for centuries a popular pastime in both Europe and North America) and, after World War/uni00A0II, to DDT pollution, which degraded their eggshells. Until the middle of the 20th century, the bald eagle received no federal protective designation. The idea would have seemed absurd: /T_he species oered humanity no appreciable bene/f_its. Eagles competed with hunt-ers for small game and tormented livestock. /T_hey were treated, therefore, like rats, wolves, or any other nui-sance animals. Americans killed them indiscriminately. /D.sc/a.sc/v.sc/i.sc/s.sc /i.sc/s.sc able to locate, prior to the 20th century, approximately four American citizens who pub-licly expressed compassion for the bald eagle. Walt Whitman wrote an ode to the bird's acrobatic mid-air courtship ritual in Leaves of Grass, the naturalist John Burroughs praised its \"dignity,\" and an anony-mous author in 1831 published an article called \"/T_he Eagle\" that ran in a number of local newspapers. /T_he correspondent describes watching a bald eagle dive from a tree to attack a wild turkey. /T_he author, /f_ight-ing his own instinct to kill the eagle, stops himself at the last second: \"Admiration and awe prevented me. I felt he was the emblem and inspiration of my coun-try.\" Faced with the majesty of the bird, he writes, \"I shrunk into my own insigni/f_icance, and have ever since been sensible of my own inferiority.\" This rare expression of human humility was echoed by Wilson, who was the nation's pre eminent ornithologist before being eclipsed by Audubon. Despite his suspicions about the bald's taste for infant blood, Wilson wrote approvingly of the bird's They were treated like rats, wolves, or any other nuisance animals. Americans killed them indiscrimi- nately. 96BOOKS To the sadism of white America, Davis contrasts the Native reverence for living creatures. Many North American tribes ascribed spiritual qualities to eagles, considering them avatars of strength and wisdom. For the Te'po'ta'ahl of California's central coast, the bald eagle is the Creator himself. After constructing the world, Bald Eagle molds a man from clay, turns one of his feathers into a woman, and brings the man to life with a flap of his wings (in a plot twist, Bald Eagle next orders a coyote to inseminate Eve). Eagle feathers were used in religious ceremonies, dances, powwows, medicine rites, piercings, doll dresses\u2014but of course all those feathers had to be plucked out of real birds, and preferably live ones. Native peoples, who also told stories about balds abducting infants, silently endured their own \"bird of paradox\" ironies. Though Davis writes that they \"spoke to animals as if speaking to an elder: with respect,\" and that \"many people today think of Indians as the original environmentalists,\" he also must acknowledge that they killed loads of eagles. He describes parkas sewed out of the downy skin of eaglets, a dance troupe dressed in the feathers of 300 birds, and a ritual in which eaglets were sprinkled with cornmeal and squeezed to death. Some of the customs persist: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Eagle Repository, the legally designated morgue for every dead eagle in the nation, distrib- utes feathers, heads, and entire corpses to various tribes for use in ceremonies. The agency also recently authorized the Hopi to seize 40 eaglets a year from their nests, douse them in cornmeal, and strangle them. Such horrors don't begin to reach the scale or malice of the carnage wrought by white people, but I suspect eagles don't share Davis's reverence for Native customs. The modern age began in 1900, with the pas- sage of federal legislation to ban the illegal trade of wild animals. Broader legislation followed, urged on by a growing movement of conservation groups. The most powerful of these was the National Association of Audubon Societies, though Davis points out that its leadership, dominated by \"sportsmen,\" shared its namesake's callousness toward the bald eagle. The group opposed protections for years\u2014refusing even to condemn Alaska's bounty on the species\u2014until it caved to patriotic appeals in 1930. The symbol- ism that had threatened to doom the bird saved it in the end. Activists learned that Americans who cared little for nonhuman life could be convinced that the in discriminate slaughter of the national symbol was as distasteful as burning the flag. After the passage of the Endangered Species Act and\u2014not coincidentally\u2014the bicentennial, the eagle was classified as endangered in most of the Lower 48 states, and threatened in the rest. A species once abun- dant in every part of the country had largely retreated to Alaska. Conservation graduated to propagation. Misdirected pangs of patriotism helped inspire extraor- dinary feats of intervention. To reintroduce the bald to southern climates, researchers drove a motor home straight from Florida to Oklahoma with incubators balanced on their laps, turning the eggs every three hours. Davis writes of Alaskan eaglets shipped to New York State, Floridian eggs placed beneath un witting Oklahoman hens, and a pair of Michigan eaglets debarking at Logan International Airport to establish Massachusetts's first nesting eagle population in nearly a century. Caretakers watched two eaglets full-time, separated from nests by one-way glass; hand-fed eaglets hundreds of pounds of quail; relocated an alligator from a nearby pond; rescued a fallen fledgling; and wore an oversize mesh \"ghillie\" suit to avoid creating any positive associations with humanity. There's no avoiding us, however. In the end, balds and human beings face the same challenge: how to live together in peace. Eagles have been more adapt- able than many other species, and we have made a far greater effort to save them than we have, say, the Florida scrub jay or the marbled murrelet. In recent years, balds have made thriving habitats at a former biological-weapons facility, a hydroelectric station\u2014a reliable source of dead fish\u2014and the Alaskan port of Dutch Harbor (home to Deadliest Catch), where eagles clean fishing nets, buzz dogs, and steal groceries from a supermarket parking lot. Reintroduction has been so successful that the federal government has begun to consider a new chapter in our stewardship of the spe - cies: population control . The lesson Davis draws from the bald eagle's suc- cess story is \"that our nature is predisposed to virtue.\" The weight of the historical record would seem to suggest a predisposition to recklessness, cruelty, and violence, but the larger point is clear: More species had better become patriotic symbols soon. I'd like to propose for consideration the eastern black rail, a mysterious mouse-size bird found in southwestern Louisiana. It is distinguished by its red eyes and big feet. It disdains flying, and sneaks through coastal marshes under the cover of night. It has a delicate bone structure, is gravely threatened by the fossil-fuel industry, and is close to extinction. Who better to speak for the republic than the eastern black rail? Nathaniel Rich is the author, most recently, of Second Nature: Scenes From a World Remade .98 ILLUSTRATION BY LINDA MERADCulture & Critics 0322_CC_Shulevitz_Heti novels, How Should a Person Be? (2012) and Motherhood (2018), I kept thinking that I was the only one who noticed how religious they are\u2014Jewish, mostly, which is how she was raised, but Christian too, with some non-Western source material thrown in. Once I'd Googled the reviews, I realized I was right and wrong. With a few exceptions, she has not been pigeonholed as a Jewish writer or, worse, the author of works on spiri-tuality. Instead, she's seen by mainstream critics as a feminist, which she is; as avant-garde, which I suppose she is (although I never quite know what that means); and as a writer of auto/f_iction, which she isn't. I don't deny that some of her work has auto- biographical content. How Should a Person Be? hews closely to Heti's coming-of-age as a writer in a small circle of young artists in Toronto, and the narrator of Motherhood is a successful writer and childless divor-c\u00e9e approaching 40, as Heti was when she wrote the book. Her new novel, Pure Colour, has one important element drawn from life, the death of her father. Heti plunders her experiences and emotions and sexuality for material, but what novelist doesn't, to a greater or lesser extent? In Heti's hands, her story is a means to an end that most so-called auto/f_iction writers\u2014indeed, most writers of anything perceived as meta/f_ictional\u2014 would shy away from. She is doing more than blurring the boundary between the real and the made-up. Heti uses the details of her life to do theology. Her novels have the digressive quality of essays, and they take on such topics as what God wants of her\u2014that is, if there's a God to do the wanting. In Pure Colour, she follows her fascination with the sacred into domains so surreal that we have to abandon any notion that she's merely some sort of postmodern diarist. We have to pay Heti the courtesy of taking her question lit-erally. She really wants to know: How should a person be? In /T_he New Yorker, James Wood called this \"a religiously important question\" that Heti answers so /f_lippantly that she must be aiming at \"a calculated desacralization.\" I think he is reading her exactly backwards. Heti is calculatedly resacralizing a dis-enchanted world. Her novels are quests for the holy inside the profane. How Should a Person Be? confuses critics because people on spiritual journeys aren't supposed to say \"fuck\" so much, or /f_ind ecstasy while gagging on the penis of an imperious new sex part-ner. \"I don't see why you walk down the street so eas-ily, not noticing that you are living half a life,\" thinks Sheila, the narrator of that novel, addressing all the unlucky women of the world who don't know that the only thing worth doing is \"getting your brains fucked out of your skull\" by her lover. Heti distracts from her seriousness of purpose with vaudevillian quick-changes in tone. She's droll! She's empyrean to the smutty. \"One good thing about being a woman is that we haven't too many examples yet of what a genius looks like,\" Sheila re/f_lects. \"It could be me.\" Her male writer friends know what they're supposed to do, and it irks her: talk themselves up and be super oblique so \"the academics will study them forever.\" Her female genius may well consist of \"giving blow jobs in heaven.\" Why not? Both How Should a Person Be? and Motherhood are full of biblical allusions, including Jacob wrestling with the angel, a match that ends with the patriarch being renamed Israel. So it can be no coincidence that in How Should a Person Be? Sheila's ever more sadistic paramour is named Israel and she sings those hosannas to the \"magni/f_icent cock of Israel.\" Take that as a joke if you will, but later, in a chapter called \"Destiny Is the Smashing of the Idols,\" Sheila will free herself from Israel's thrall by insisting on putting her lips to his penis against his wishes\u2014a deliberate act of humiliation meant to assert her independence, not to please him. /T_his insubordination leads to \"real happiness,\" she says, \"like I was /f_loating upward to the heavens.\" Even when Sheila prays, she's sacrilegious: \"May the Lord have mercy on me for I am a fucking idiot.\" I can't tell you how happy that made me. I go to synagogue fairly often, and there isn't a single line in the siddur that sounds to me as much like the way I talk to God. Motherhood is only somewhat less likely to non- plus the reader than How Should a Person Be? On one level, it's a feminist disputation over art versus maternity\u2014 whether a female writer must be a mother or whether she can get away with being just (just!) a BOOKS /T_he Smutty Mystic What everyone gets wrong about Sheila of content is unchildish, often seedy: \"On her /f_loor lived a lonely man,\" Heti writes of her protagonist, Mira, and \"in their bathroom was a dirty tub, so she never took a bath, and she rarely show-ered.\" But really, how do you categorize a novel in which the Lord makes a sudden appearance in order to split into \"three art critics in the sky\" who take the form of a bird, a /f_ish, and a bear? Perhaps this is Heti's Torah\u2014that is, in the literal sense of the word, her teaching, not to be confused with the Torah, the Five Books of Moses. A reader of the Gospels might spot the in/f_luence of parable, the kind that Jesus used to overturn the order of things. Heti begins at the beginning, or almost the begin-ning, on the seventh day of Creation. Well, actually, she's describing what Creation would have looked like if God were an artist well-enough versed in Kab-balah to obey the principle of tzimtzum, according to which God must withdraw to allow the universe to come to fruition: After God created the heavens and the earth, he stood back to contemplate creation, like a painter standing back from the canvas. /T_his is the moment we are living in\u2014the moment of God standing back. God's handiwork has disappointed him, however, and so \"the moment we are living in\" appears to be an escalation of what happened the /f_irst time God was dissatis/f_ied, when he wiped out nearly all people and animals in the Flood. /T_his time the imminent catastro-phe is global warming, which Heti posits as threaten-ing not just animal life but all of Creation, including the planet: \"Now the earth is heating up in advance of its destruction by God, who has decided that the /f_irst draft of existence contained too many /f_laws.\" /A.sc/s.sc /i.sc/n.sc the Book of Genesis, we move fairly quickly from the history of the world to the story of one person, the young woman named Mira. Mira attends an inter-national branch of the prestigious American Academy of American Critics, apparently just before the advent of the internet. (\"Can we say that friendships were dif-ferent then?\" she asks. \"Everyone had their own little life, which touched the lives of other people only at par-ties.\") At this vaguely Gallic institution, students drink tisanes and eat croissants and smoke pot and stand on desks to issue pronunciamentos, because they, the elect, are there \"to develop a style of writing and thinking that could survive down through the ages, and at the same time penetrate their own generation so incisively.\" /T_he narrator notes drily that these young intellectuals don't know that one day everyone will carry phones writer. But this is also a book about life with a capi-tal/uni00A0L: what having the God-given power to create it or to decline to create it means. What cosmic obligations do a woman's reproductive capacities impose on her? What does she owe to \"the life that wants to be lived through\" her? Is art sucient compensation for the \"beautiful and incredibly rare gift\" of life, \"whose debt I will forever be in\"? You might call Motherhood Talmudic, if the rabbis had been 30-something female novelists nervously eye-ing their biological clocks. /T_he 30-something female novelist in Motherhood turns for guidance to nothing less than the universe, as channeled by an I/uni00A0Ching-like oracle invoked by the toss of three coins. /T_he oracle, by far the funniest character in the novel, responds with yes or no answers that simultaneously de/f_late the nar-rator's philosophizing and give sound advice on how to be more chill about her career and relation ships. Once again, Heti exploits incongruity for laughs. Ovulation produces \"days of sparkling joy,\" while the days lead-ing up to the narrator's period are a monthly blight. Why would God subject a woman to this hormonal roller coaster? Or, as Heti poses the question, \"what to make of God's two faces, the all-accepting and loving New Testament Ovulating God, and the vindictive and rageful Old Testament PMS God?\" Given the pro-creative power of the Lord, endowing her with female reproductive organs and corresponding mental states seems perfectly reasonable. Moreover, maybe the men-strual cycle exists to make manifest \"how a human is part of time, or is bound to time, or is time.\" But you have to admit that Heti's version of imitatio Dei has high-quality shock value. PURE COLOUR is Heti's coming-out novel. It /f_launts its biblicality. Like the Bible itself, it's a mashup of fairy tale and myth, with a Broadway musical tossed in for good measure. Pure Colour is unabashedly meta- physical and completely outlandish. At the same time, this is a book of mourning, speci/f_ically for a father. Heti's tone is more somber and searching than it has ever been, as she turns over and over fundamental questions of life and death, creation and extinction, with her trademark penchant for paradox. Yet neither grief nor theology can suppress Heti's oddball wit and aection for wildly inappropriate sexual metaphors, for which a reader should be grateful. If a critic is supposed to pinpoint a genre, I'll have to take a pass. Pure Colour is not fantasy, nor is it science fiction, although, in the style of Margaret Atwood and Kazuo Ishiguro, Heti defamiliarizes our present way of life by creating an alternative one with intermittent and disturbing similarities to the one we think we know. /T_he language is childlike, with the BOOKS 0322_CC_Shulevitz_Heti [Print]_15894169.indd 100 1/14/2022 9:58:44 AM100AN INSTANT BOOKSHOP .ORG BESTSELLER COME ALONG AND RIDE THIS TRAIN \"ED DAVIS has done for American railroads what KEROUAC did for American highways and STEINBECK did for American nomads.\" \u2014JERRY CIMINO, The Beat Museum \"Wow, what an Pulitzer Prize Winner \"Blending key ingredients [of] Gothic fiction (think a Flannery O'Connor) , a dystopian thriller (like The Road or The Chrysalids ), a crime drama (Reservoir Dogs ), and a sort of gritty...literature piece like The Devil All the Time , The Last Professional is unsettlingly unpredictable.\" \u2014MEDIUM.COM GET ON BOARD!

Mira kisses Annie, though they never speak of it. /T_hen Mira's father dies. Orphanhood turns out to be less enviable than it looked. /T_he next thing you know, Mira's spirit has entered a leaf. To be fair, Heti has prepared us for this eventu-ality by describing the transmigration of Mira's father's soul into her body. /T_he moment he died, his spirit entered hers, and she felt peace and joy. And \"if the spirit of a father can move into a daughter, this must be happening all over the world, spirits entering other bodies, when a person dies.\" Unfortunately, there's not a lot to do once you've relocated to a leaf. Mira's thoughts begin to move at the unhurried pace of nature itself. She discovers that she shares the leaf with her father's spirit, which ini-tially doesn't want to talk. When she succeeds in draw-ing him out, they endlessly debate weighty matters. Mira takes comfort from nestling close to him, but their cohabitation is claustrophobia-inducing, to the reader as well as to her. Annie happens by and Mira tries to attract her attention and get herself rescued. Leaves can't scream, however, and Annie doesn't hear. But at last she notices Mira. /T_he leaf breaks open in a burst of golden light and Mira falls out. Being a leaf has changed Mira, instilling in her an awareness of the vast span of time as well as an aver-sion to busyness, the human need always to /f_ix things: \"Plants have learned, over millions of years, how to be the audience of creation.\" She tries to impart her plant wisdom to Annie, but Annie is having none of it. And from that point on, Mira faces a life of pro-found isolation. Color is a thing you have to see to know what it's like, and so is Pure Colour . To describe the plot is to run the danger of making it sound random, which it is and isn't. /T_here is a logic here, though it's very strange. Yes, Pure Colour is mystical. Tonally, Heti sounds a lot like the great Christian philosopher- mystic (and convert from Judaism) Simone Weil, who has a similar love of paradox and whom Heti has said she looks up to. But Heti is the rare mystic with a sense of humor. She can play the clown and talk God talk at the same time. /T_his is a gloriously implausible book. Maybe Pure Colour is best labeled a cosmological farce; if so, that's a discom/f_iting genre. /T_he God of this novel is every-where and in everything, but he is less concerned with human happiness than one might have hoped. Judith Shulevitz is the author of /T_he Sabbath World: Glimpses of a Dierent Order of Time.from which \"people who had far more charisma than they did would let /f_low an endless stream of images and words. /T_hey just had no idea that the world would become so big, or the competition so sti.\" Mira is an always interesting but haunting charac- ter; even in a group, she seems cut o and alone, and she tends to lose herself in private obsessions. Before she went to school, she worked at a lamp store, an old-fashioned place that eschewed modern lighting for Tiany lamps and any others made of colored glass. Mira was entranced by one lamp in particular: \"It had green blobs and red blobs; little polished stones of coloured glass that were held together by a network of iron. It was the most wonderful thing Mira had ever seen.\" One day she stole it, not for cash but for the pure joy of watching its colors play on her white walls, which made her love \"her meagre little existence,\" because it was \"entirely her own.\" Later, when she got a job selling rings at a jewelry store, she sat and gazed at them all day, bewitched by pink amethysts, dierent shades of gold, \"icy platinums which held within them a deep and private blueness.\" If Motherhood was a rumination on God's act of Creation and the human mirroring of his generative power through art and babies, Pure Colour is a medita- tion on the beauty of Creation. \"God is most proud of creation as an aesthetic thing,\" Heti writes. But what does that mean, \"an aesthetic thing\"? In Pure Colour, it means color. Color expresses the character of experi-ence, and our experience of color is irreducibly subjec-tive. To put it another way, color is what life feels like. \"Colour is not just a representation of the world, but of the feelings in a room, and the meaningful ness of a room in time,\" Mira says. She describes her relation-ship with her father, who raised her by himself, as \"gold and green,\" by which she means that her father \"was always pointing out the beauty of the world to her, its greatness and its mystery, and his attention had made her feel cherished and loved.\" By contrast, the room in which she watched him die had a \"sort of maroon-ish light.\" It was a color Mira had never seen before, she says, because \"it was the colour of a father dying.\" Part of Heti's charm is her knack for coming from as far out of left /f_ield as possible, and here she has amped up her unpredictability. Readers may recognize a character named Annie as Orphan Annie, the plucky heroine of the musical. Heti's Annie did once sing and dance with her friends at an orphanage, but now she is all grown up and disdainful and lives in an apartment that smells like rat shit. Mira and the other students don't care about that; they envy her poise and the fact that she comes from a place that is \"so marvellously bleak.\" Heti, as usual, casually drops in jarring meta-phors. Mira and Annie develop an unspoken bond, and whenever Mira sees her, she feels a widening in her Part of Heti's charm is her knack for coming from as far out of left field as possible.BOOKS 0322_CC_Shulevitz_Heti [Print]_15894169.indd 102 1/14/2022 9:58:44 AM102Hi, I'm Steve Frank I suered from sleep apnea for years.

Instead I'm checking the time every 42 seconds and cursing the laws of physics. Am I that pathetic, though? Yes. But here's the thing about punctuality: It doesn't really exist. Perfect punctuality is a pinhead, a notional point on the con- tinuum, kind of a Zeno's paradox. To be punctual, you have to be early\u2014 because if you're not early, you're late. And what does being early mean? It means padding your schedule with loose minutes, margins for error, insulating layers of dead time. It means waiting rooms. It means the tickle of the abyss. Alice's Adventures in Wonder land gives us two opposing principles, cosmic rhythm and counter-rhythm: the girl in her summery tor- por, the palpitating rabbit. I choose lateness.
