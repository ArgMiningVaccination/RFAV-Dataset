Summer Drag? 3 THE LOREM IPSUMS SUMMER 2012 Supplement Basics New baby? Save money and be healthier by m aking homemade baby food! Did you know you can make your own baby food which is more affordable and better for y our baby? I t's true. Many of the baby foods on the market are full of fillers, artificial flavors, sugars and fake sugars. Studies show that a child's taste buds are fully developed by age 3. That means it is absolutely vital to start their diet correctly AND keep it clean and natural! Stop the \"picky eater\" mentality now and help your kid love food as a fuel source and not an emotional connection. Email Dr. Kleene if you need help giving a great baby gift of helping a loved one make their new baby healthy and nutritious first foods. drcj@mybackinline.com At Back in Line we feel most of us need a basic foundational support to help achieve a healthy active lifestyle. A t the very minimum, we feel strongly a bout a few basic daily supplements Those CORE 4 are: Multivitamin (the basics of vitamins and minerals) Probiotic Omega 3 Fatty Acids (DHA:EPA of 3:2) Vitamin D. Since Dr. CJ began her Fellowship through the Amer ican Academy of Anti -Aging and Regner ative Medicine her guidelines for prevention have become stricter and the call for supplementation has grown stronger. The reality is simply our food sources are ju st not as great as they were 10 0 years ago or even 20 years ago, not to mention the processing of many foods has denatured many health benefits natural non -processed foods do. Many people still want more scientific evidence and proof of such deficencies for each individual. Thanfully, micronutrient testing exists today. A micronutrient test is a blood panel that tests for our B vitamins as well as vitamins D, K, and antioxidants such as glutathione, our carbohydrate metabolism , glucose interaction , a variety of amino acids and more. The test is $350 and ha s a 2 week turn -around. For examples, please visit our websie to view Dr. CJ's own personal results. We also feel Vitamin D blood testing along with many other basic labs are key to prevention of disease and discomfort. Please consoul with your primary c are or schedule a functional medicine heal th evaluation with Dr. CJ today to be on the forefront of scientific, data driven prevention. *Please be advised, scheduling for FM exams have a wait list until the end of August. We apologize for any inconvienec e. 4 THE LOREM IPSUMS SUMMER 2012 \\Things to do this summer! Farmers Markets The 1st and 3rd Saturday of every month!

What does it mean to be FMS Certified? Along with being the top Sports Chiropractor in the area, Dr. Weber has a specific set of criteria aimed at helping find specific weak areas in each individual that can potentially manifest into a more serious game -changing injury. Our student athletes and today's marathoner and triathlete cannot afford an injury or set -back during the heart of the season. Read more below to find out specifical ly what the FMS protocol is and why you and the athletes in your family need to be screened. \"The Fundamental Movement Screen captures fundamental movements, motor control within movement patterns, and competence of basic movements uncomplicated by sp ecific skills. It will determine the greatest areas of movement deficiency, demonstrate limitations or asymmetries, and eventually correlate these with an outcome. Once you find the greatest asymmetry or deficiency, you can use measurements that are more precise if needed. The original idea of the screen was to portray movement -pattern quality with a simple grading system of movement appraisal; it's not intended to diagnose or measure isolated joint movement. Attempting to measure in isolation does a disservice to the pattern - the body is too complex to take isolated movements seriously in the initial stages of screening. This system was developed to rate and rank movement patterns in high school athletes, but through a two -year refining process, we discovered uses beyond its original intended purpose. While we have not changed the screen since its official introduction in 1998, the information gathered from its use has broadened our scope of corrective exercise, training & rehabilitation. The scree n has taught us how to use it, and helped us gain timely and valuable feedback from our attempts at movement correction. Our collective experience has come from working against the screen's standard, not from modifying the screen every time things got confusing or inconvenient. We have changed the way we look at the screen data many times, but we have not changed the way we collect the information. In a way, this work represents our evolution, not that of the screen. The screen patiently waited for us t o see and understand all it was providing in return for about 10 minutes worth of time. The FMS is comprised of seven movement tests that require a balance of mobility and stability. The patterns used provide observable performance of basic, manipulative and stabilizing movements by placing clients in positions where weaknesses, imbalances, asymmetries and limitations become noticeable by a trained health and fitness professional. When a screen's movements mimic athletic moves, it is merely coincidence . The screen is not a training tool, nor is it a competition tool. It's purely an instrument for rating and ranking movements. The screen's usefulness is its simplicity, practicality, and ability to fill a void in the toolbox we use to judge performance and durability. It is not intended to determine why a dysfunctional movement pattern exists. Instead, it's a discovery of which patterns are problematic. The FMS exposes dysfunction or pain - or both - within basic movement Dr. Nate Weber, DC, MS 6 THE LOREM IPSUMS SUMMER 2012 Many people are able to perform a wide range of activities, yet are unable to efficiently execute the movements in the screen. Those who score p oorly on the screens are using compensatory movement patterns during regular activities. If these compensations continue, sub -optimal movement patterns are reinforced, leading to poor biomechanics and possibly contributing to a future injury.\" -Gray Cook MSPT, OCS, CSCS - FMS Manual - Introduction Take home points - for those of you who \"just want the facts\": The screen evaluates movements and identifies asymmetries, dysfunctional patterns, and identifies the most likely sources of potential injury risk . The FMS is predictive - we cannot say anything will prevent an injury from occurring - take Kevin Ware - Duke v. Louisville in this year's NCAA men's basketball tournament - this guy has access to some elite level trainers and clinicians - he landed fun ny & snapped his leg in two - LIFE HAPPENS and you cannot prevent injuries from occurring - but if you can identify the most likely sources of compensation/dysfunction and improve those patterns you can reduce your risk of an injury/compensation occurring. Dr. Weber will be including the FMS screen as a part of our r egular school/sports physicals. Please contact Julie or Caitlin at 892.3363 if you would like to have yourself or your child screened and help with establishing a specific strengthening progr am developed for you or them. You may also contact Dr. Weber directly if you would like to schedule a screen for a running club, performance therapy group, and more.
