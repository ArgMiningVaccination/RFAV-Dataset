However, early viral clearance by IFN-I could limit antigen availability, which could in turn impinge upon the priming of the adaptive immune system. In this study, we hypothesized that transient IFN-I blockade could increase antigen presentation after acute viral infection. To test this hypothesis, we infected mice with viruses coadministered with a single dose of IFN-I receptor -blocking antibody to induce a short-term blockade of the IFN-I pathway. This resulted in a transient \"spike \"in antigen levels, followed by rapid antigen clearance. Interestingly, short-term IFN-I blockade after coronavirus, flavivirus, rhabdovirus, or arenavirus infection induced a long-lasting enhancement of immunological memory that conferred improved protection upon subsequent reinfections. Short-term IFN-I blockade also improved the efficacy of viral vaccines. These findingsdemonstrate a novel mechanism by which IFN-I regulate immunological memory and provide insights for rational vaccine design. Introduction Type I interferons (IFN-I) are a first line of defense during viral infection. Absence of IFN-I results in disseminated viral in- fections and impaired priming of adaptive immune responses (Burns et al., 2016 ;Ciancanelli et al., 2015 ;Duncan et al., 2015 ; Dupuis et al., 2003 ;Erickson and Pfeiffer, 2013 ;Hambleton et al., 2013 ;Hernandez et al., 2019 ;Hernandez et al., 2018 ;Hoyos- Bachiloglu et al., 2017 ;Kolumam et al., 2005 ;Kreins et al., 2015 ;Le Bon et al., 2003 ;Minegishi et al., 2006 ;Moens et al., 2017;Sandler et al., 2014 ;Shahni et al., 2015 ;Stark et al., 1998 ; Teijaro et al., 2013 ;Wilson et al., 2013 ). Robust IFN-I responses are also a hallmark of effective vaccines ( Gaucher et al., 2008 ;Li et al., 2017 ;Pulendran and Ahmed, 2011 ;Pulendran et al., 2010 ; Querec et al., 2009 ). However, there is an overlooked paradox between IFN-I and the elicitation of long-lived antiviral immu-nity: IFN-I can restrict initial viral replication, which in turncould limit antigen availability at a critical time when theadaptive immune system is getting primed. This conundrummotivated us to analyze the effects of transiently blocking IFN-I early after viral infection, with the goal of augmenting hyper- acute antigen levels and subsequent antigen priming. Here, we show that short-term IFN-I blockade during an initial viral infection results in a profound improvement ofimmunological memory, rendering the host better protectedagainst subsequent reinfections with similar or more virulentpathogens. These findings are important for two reasons. First, they highlight an interesting mechanism by which innate im- munity regulates long-lived immunological memory. Second, they may have important implications for rational vaccinedesign. Results Short-term IFN-I blockade during acute viral infectionimproves immunological memory Discovered more than six decades ago, IFN-I have been shown to play an indispensable role in antiviral immunity. Long-termdefects in the IFN-I pathway result in impairment of immuneresponses following acute viral infections or vaccinations.However, it is currently unclear whether a short-term blockadeof IFN-I would have a similar effect. To transiently block theIFN-I pathway, we used an IFN-I receptor -blocking antibody (IFNAR1, clone MAR1-5A3) that has been used in prior studies (Bhattacharyya et al., 2017 ;Teijaro et al., 2013 ;Wang et al., 2019 ; Wilson et al., 2013 ). We first corroborated that this antibody blocks IFN-I signaling in vitro ( Fig. S1 A ). We then immunized mice with different viruses, which were coadministered withcontrol IgG or IFNAR1 to induce a short-term blockade of the IFN-I pathway ( Fig. 1 A ). This single dose of IFNAR1 resulted in ............................................................................................................................... ..............................................

In these experiments, we coadministered the IFNAR1 antibody locally (intramuscularly) together with the virus. As shown in Fig. 1 B ,afraction of the antibody goes systemic, since there is blockade of IFNAR1 in the blood. Interestingly, short-term IFN-I blockade after a Zika virus infection resulted in a 36-fold improvement in CD8 T cell Figure 1.

Journal of Experimental Medicine 2o f1 4 IFN-I modulation improves viral immunity https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20191220responses and an 82-fold improvement in antibody responses (Fig. 1, C -E). Short-term IFN-I blockade also resulted in a sub- cytokine coexpressing T cells ( Fig. 1, F -H). Short-term IFN-I blockade also improved adaptive immune responses following an acute c o r o n a v i r u si n f e c t i o nw i t hm o u s eh e p a t i t i sv i r u s( M H V ; Fig. 1, I and J ), which is in the same genera as SARS-CoV ( Betacoronavir- idae). These data showed or hyperacute blockade of IFN-I improves the immunogenicity of acute viral infections. We then evaluated whether these same effects could apply to viral vaccines. Interestingly, IFN-I blockade improved the im-munogenicity of the clinically approved yellow fever virus vaccine (YFV-17D; Fig. 2, A -C). Rhabdovirus- and arenavirus- based vaccines were also significantly improved after short-term IFN-I blockade ( Fig. 2, D -L;a n d Fig. S1, C and D ). SIV measured in vitro neutralization assays ( Fig. S1 E ). In the context of LCMV-HIV vaccination, short-term IFN-I blockade facilitated germinal center B cell responses ( Fig. S1 F ), which suggested that antibody diversification was improved. Amain challenge for developing vaccines against highly evolving viruses, such as HIV, is that vaccines based on a specific viralstrain may not confer substantial cross-reactive humoral im-munity against heterologous viral strains. However, IFN-I blockade resulted in a 17-fold improvement in cross-reactive humoral immunity a fter S1 G ). Overall, our short-term IFN-I blockade regimen seemed well tolerated, andmice did not exhibit overt weight loss after infection ( Fig. S1 H ). In addition, IFN-I blockade improv ed cytokine coexpression by HIV- specific T cells compared with control vaccination ( Fig. S1, I -M). Altogether, these data with diffe rent viral vaccines suggest that short-term IFN-I blockade paradoxically acts as a potent adjuvant. The data above involved intramuscular infection/vaccina- tion, so we investigated whether these effects were dependenton the route. We observed a similar increase in immune re-sponses when mice were injected via the subcutaneous or in-tranasal routes ( Fig. S2 ), suggesting that our observations were not dependent on the route of infection. Transcriptional and virological analyses We analyzed gene expression on virus-specific CD8 T cells at the peak of the response, 7 d after acute infection with LCMV ( Fig. 3, Figure 2.

Short-term IFN-I blockade induced increased CD44 expression at the gene level ( Fig. 3, C and D ) and at the protein level ( Fig. 3 E ) relative to control. IFN-I blockade also induced enriched expression of TCR signaling genes by Ingenuity Pathway Analyses (IPA; Fig. 3 F ) and costimulation genes by IPA and gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA; Fig. 3, F and G ).Paradoxically, IFN-I -driven genes and IFN-I levels were increased in mice that received IFN-I blockade earlier dur-ing infection ( Fig. 3, H -J), suggesting a \"compensatory \"IFN- I response. There was also enrichment in IFN , IL-12, and IL-15 signaling genes in mice that received IFN-I blockade ( Fig. 3, K-M), and these mice also exhibited increased activation and Figure 3. Transcriptional analyses of virus-specific CD8 T cells.

Journal of Experimental Medicine 4o f1 4 IFN-I modulation improves viral immunity https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20191220effector signatures ( Fig. 3, N and O ). These data suggest that IFN-I blockade during the priming phase improved TCR andcostimulation signaling later during the effector phase. TCRtriggering and costimulation are two main signals required foractivation of the adaptive immune system. Furthermore, ourdata showing increases in IFN-I, IFN , IL-12, and IL-15 signatures increase in the so-called \"third signal \"needed for the activation of T cell responses. We hypothesized that our short-term IFN-I blockade regimen could give a transient advantage to the virus, increasing antigenavailability. To evaluate this, muscles were harvested at day 7after intramuscular infection, and viral loads were quantified byplaque assays. Complete viral clearance was observed at day 7 inall mice, demonstrating that short-term IFN-I blockade does notprevent the resolution of acute viral infection, which normally occurs within a week ( Fig. S3, A -C). Since IFN-I plays an early antiviral effect shortly after viral encounter, we hypothesizedthat IFN-I blockade could increase viral burden at very earlytime points following infection. To test this, we performedplaque assays at earlier time points 72 h after infection. Con-sistent with our hypothesis, IFN-I blockade resulted in a sharpincrease in viral titers ( Fig. S3, D -F). These data demonstrate that short-term IFN-I blockade induces a transient hyperacute burst in viral antigen, which is then rapidly cleared from the body. A prior study in individuals receiving the YFV-17D vaccine showed a positive correlation between vaccine replication andTc e l lr e s p o n s e s( Akondy et al., 2015 ). Namely, individuals with the highest level of vaccine replication showed the most potentT cell response following vaccination. A logical prediction fromthat study is that increasing the dose of the vaccine would in- crease antigen levels and subsequent immunogenicity. How- ever, we show that increasing vaccine dose in control mice(from 10 2to 104PFU, blue bars) does not significantly augment early viral loads 72 h after LCMV infection ( Fig. S3 D ). Similar virologic effects were observed after vesicular stomatitis virus(VSV) vaccination and YFV-17D vaccination ( Fig. S3, E and F ). These results show that there is a strict limit on how muchantigen can be expressed at the site of infection. These data also highlight that antigen levels depend mostly on the exponential replication of the virus, which critically depends on the trans-lational machinery of infected cells. Since protein synthesis isinhibited by IFN-stimulated genes ( Schoggins, 2019 ), this can help explain why injecting more virus did not substantially in-crease acute antigen loads. It is important to highlight that, following intramuscular infection, most of the virus replicates in situ, and very low levels of virus were detected in circulation. Systemic viral load was also resolved by day 7 in all mice ( Fig. S3 G ). This demonstrates that short-term IFN-I blockade does not abro- gate the ultimate clearance of the viral infection within aweek. We also show that increasing viral dose does not sig-nificantly increase immunogenicity ( Fig. S3, H and I ). In summary, our findings demonst rate that short-term IFN-I blockade increases early antigen availability and immunoge- nicity in a way that cannot be recapitulated simply by in- creasing viral dose.Mechanism: Effects of IFN-I blockade on antigen presentation and costimulationOur plaque assay data shown above demonstrate that short-termIFN-I blockade induces a transient increase in viral antigen 72 hafter infection. Those experiments, however, did not specificallymeasure antigen loads in antigen-presenting cells, which arecritical for the induction of adaptive immunity. We thus ex- amined the effects of IFN-I blockade on dendritic cells (DCs) using an in vitro infection system. We DCs with re-combinant LCMV or MHV coronavirus -expressing GFP, and then we evaluated GFP expressionon DCs. Our results show that IFN-I blockade resulted in morecopious infection foci relative to control ( Fig. 4, A and B ). We also interrogated whether DCs from mice that received short-term IFN-I blockade were more effective at presenting cognate antigen and expressing costimulatory molecules ( Fig. 4 C). DCs from mice that received IFN-I blockade during primary viral infection showed higher levels of MHC-I molecules pre-senting cognate antigen ( Fig. 4, D and E ) and expressed higher levels of costimulatory molecules ( Fig. 4, F and G )r e l a t i v et o control. At first glance, these data seemed counterintuitive,given that IFN-I signaling is a positive regulator of antigenpresentation and costimulation. However, as shown earlier, blockade of the IFN-I pathway lasted only 96 h, and this was followed by a compensatory IFN-I response ( Fig. 3, H -J), which could have explained the increase in antigen presentation andcostimulation by DCs after day 5. The IFN-I receptor is widely expressed on many cells, in- cluding DCs, which are also major producers of IFN-I ( Reizis et al., 2011 ). This motivated us to study the DC-intrinsic effects of IFN-I signaling. We evaluated whether the absence of IFN-I signaling specifically on DCs would phenocopy the effect of short-term IFN-I blockade. We performed DC vaccinations usingIfnar1 /DCs infected 24 h earlier with LCMV Armstrong (Fig. 4 H ). Strikingly, transfer of Ifnar1/DCs resulted in greater CD8 T cell responses relative to wild-type DCs ( Fig. 4 I ), suggesting that IFN-I blockade modulated DC function. We alsoperformed adoptive transfers of LCMV-specific T cells lackingIFNAR1 ( Ifnar1 /) followed by acute LCMV infection, and, consistent with prior reports ( Kolumam et al., 2005 ;Havenar- Daughton et al., 2006 ), the permanent absence of IFN-I sig- naling on T cells resulted in long-term impairment of theseresponses (data not shown). According to prior studies, thiscould be explained by NK (Natural killer) cell -mediated killing of activated Ifnar1 /T cells ( Crouse et al., 2014 ;Xu et al., 2014 ). These earlier studies indicate that IFN-I signaling is intrinsi-cally required for T cell immunity. Furthermore, we evaluated whether the adjuvant effect of IFN-I blockade was time de- pendent. We show that IFN-I blockade at day 5 after infectionhas no effect ( Fig. S4, A -D), likely because IFN-I production normally subsides within 2 -3 d of acute viral infection ( Fig. 3 J ; Norris et al., 2013 ;Zuniga et al., 2008 ). IFN-I exert antiviral effects by regulating various biological processes; for example, by inhibiting protein translation in in-fected cells or by limiting a second round of infection in adjacent cells ( Bailey et al., 2014 ;Farrell et al., 1978 ;McMichael et al., 2018 ). To determine if the adjuvant effect of short-term IFN-I Palacio et al. Journal of Experimental Medicine 5o f1 4 IFN-I modulation improves viral immunity https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20191220blockade was dependent on the latter process, we immunized mice with single-round (nonreplicating) viruses. We first used aVSV vector that can enter cells and translate viral proteins but cannot induce a second round of infection due to genetic absence of the VSV G protein. Interestingly, short-term IFN-I blockadedid not improve the immunogenicity of this virus ( Fig. S4, E and F). Similar effects were reported with nonreplicating LCMV and Ad5 viruses ( Fig. S4, G and H ). Therefore, the adjuvant effect of IFN-I blockade is mechanistically dependent on whether the virus can cause secondary foci of infection. Until now, our Figure 4.

Journal of Experimental Medicine 6o f1 4 IFN-I modulation improves viral immunity https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20191220experiments have involved IFN-I blockade, and we next inter- rogated whether IFN-I supplementation would have an oppositeeffect ( Fig. S4 I ). Systemic administration of IFN-I throughout the first 48 h of infection impaired primary immune responses(Fig. S4, J and K ), consistent with a prior study that evaluated the effect of IFN-I supplementation ( Honke et al., 2012 ). Collectively, these data suggest that the potent adjuvant effect of short-termIFN-I blockade is dependent on the timing and the ability of thevirus to undergo additional rounds of infection. As shown earlier, short-term IFN-I blockade increases the total number of memory CD8 T cells, and the next question wasif this is caused by preferential expansion of specific memorysubsets. To answer this question, we immunized mice with VSV with or without IFN-I blockade , and then we immunophenotyped virus-specific CD8 T cells after 60 d. Consistent with our priorresults, short-term IFN-I blockade increased the numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells in tissues ( Fig. 5, A and B ). Interestingly, most of the increase in the IFN-I blockade group was due to an increasein effector memory CD8 T cells ( Fig. 5, C -G). A salient feature of effector memory CD8 T cells is th eir response-ready state ( Wherry et al., 2003 ), which can provide rapid sterilizing protection fol- lowing subsequent reinfections, especially in the context of highly replicating pathogens. This motivat ed us to perform challenge studies. IFN-I blockade during viral prime improves host protection following future reinfectionsDoes IFN-I blockade during an initial viral prime improve hostprotection after subsequent reinfections? To answer thissimple question, we immunized mice with or without IFN-I blockade, and after several weeks we challenged mice with the same virus or a related pathogen to measure anamnesticimmune protection. We used different challenge models to evaluate generalizability and to assess the contribution ofdifferent arms of the adaptive immune response in anamnesticimmune protection. In our first challenge model, mice were immunized with Zika (Puerto Rico virus [PRV] strain) with or without IFN-I blockade. After 30 d, mice were challenged intracranially with differentZika (MR766 strain) to measure cross-protection. As mice showed only partial protection afterheterologous Zika rechallenge when compared with unimmu-nized mice ( Fig. 6 A ). But mice that received an initial Zika in- fection with IFN-I blockade exhibited sterilizing immunity aftersubsequent heterologous Zika challenge ( Fig. 6 A ). These mice also exhibited improved antibody neutralization capacity by plaque reduction neutralization titer assays, with significantneutralization of heterologous Zika seradilution ( Fig. 6 B ). In our second challenge model, we interrogated whether a primary coronavirus infection with short-term IFN-I blockadewould improve protection to coronavirus reinfection. In controlimmune mice, prior exposure to coronavirus conferred partial protection upon coronavirus rechallenge, but only 20% of mice exhibited sterilizing immunity ( Fig. 6 C ). However, 100% of the mice that received IFN-I blockade during the primary corona-virus infection exhibited sterilizing immunity following subse-quent coronavirus reinfections ( Fig. 6 C ). In our third challenge model, we used the clinically approved YFV-17D vaccine with or without IFN-I blockade. Since immu-nized wild-type mice are highly resistant to YFV-17D infection, we used a passive immunization model using Ifnar1 /recipient mice, which are highly susceptible to YFV-17D ( Erickson and Figure 5.

After 2 wk, we transferred immune sera from these mice into naive Ifnar1/ recipient mice, followed by systemic challenge with YFV-17D. Strikingly, the sera of mice that received IFN-I blockade duringprior vaccination conferred sterilizing immunity in most re-cipient mice ( Fig. 6 D ). In our fourth challenge model, mice were immunized with a VSV-OVA vaccine and then challenged 30 d later with a supra-lethal dose of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) -expressing OVA (LM- OVA). Control immune mice succumbed to this bacterial chal- lenge, whereas mice that had previously received IFN-I blockadeduring the initial VSV-OVA prime survived the subsequent LM-OVA challenge ( Fig. 6 E ). Enhancement of immune protection was also observed after a viral challenge with vaccinia virus(VV) -expressing OVA ( Fig. 6 F ).

As expected, all naive and control immune micesuccumbed rapidly to this supra-lethal bacterial challenge.However, all of the mice that received IFN-I blockade during theinitial LCMV prime 30 d earlier survived the subsequentLM-GP33 challenge ( Fig. 6 G ), with 58% of animals exhibiting sterilizing immunity ( Fig. 6 H ). Finally, we used a model for coronavirus vaccination in which mice are first vaccinated with an LCMV vector, and after several weeks, they were challengedintranasally with coronavirus expressing a CD8 T cell epitopefrom LCMV (MHV-GP33). Interestingly, IFN-I blockade duringan initial vaccination conferred a fivefold improvement in im-mune protection against coronavirus ( Fig. 6 I ). Collectively, these data show that short-term IFN-I blockade during an initialviral infection or viral vaccination renders the host better pro- tected against subsequent infections with similar or related pathogens. Note that most challenge models used in Fig. 6 evaluated overall protection conferred by both cellular and humoral re-sponses. However, the experiments in Fig. 6 D specifically evaluated protection by humoral responses, whereas the ex-periments in Fig. 6, G -I, specifically evaluated protection by CD8 T cell responses (since only a CD8 epitope was matched between the primary and secondary infection). These results were all using C57BL/6 mice, but similarly, BALB/c mice also showedimproved anamnestic protection when short-term IFN-I block-ade was administered during the initial viral prime ( Fig. S5 ). Altogether, our studies using different viruses, routes, chal-lenges, and host genetic backgrounds show that a transientblockade of IFN-I signaling during an initial virus encounter canimprove immunological memory and protection against future reinfections. Such results demonstrate a novel finding: short- term IFN-I blockade during an initial viral prime induces along-term improvement in immunological memory. This posi-tive effect was reproduced among different acute viral infectionsas well as vaccinations. Discussion It is widely accepted that IFN-I play a critical role in the gen-eration of immunological memory following acute infection orvaccination. However, most studies on IFN-I have focused on the\"all-or-none \"effects of IFN-I, for example, in the context of IF- NAR1 genetic mutations that permanently impair IFN-I sensingor in the setting of long-term IFN-I blockade ( Hernandez et al., 2019 ;Kolumam et al., 2005 ;Le Bon et al., 2003 ;M\u00fcller et al., 1994;Sandler et al., 2014 ;Teijaro et al., 2013 ;Wilson et al., 2013 ). Therefore, the effects of blocking IFN-I short term, specifically at the time of viral prime, are not well studied. Here, wedemonstrate an unexpected favorable effect of blocking IFN-Ishort term. Prior studies have also evaluated the effects of IFN-I blockade in the context of immune exhaustion caused by chronic in-fections. Elegant papers by Brooks, Oldstone, and others haveshown that IFN-I blockade can ameliorate immune exhaustion during chronic LCMV infection, suggesting that IFN-I play a negative role during chronic LCMV infection. This effect is notobserved in other chronic viral infections (HIV, SIV, and Hep- atitis C virus) in which IFN-I are thought to play a positive role,suggesting virus-dependent effects ( Torriani et al., 2004 ;Azzoni et al., 2013 ;Teijaro et al., 2013 ;Wilson et al., 2013 ;Sandler et al., 2014 ;Bhattacharyya et al., 2017 ;Cheng et al., 2017 ). Our study is conceptually different than prior studies because we elucidatethe effects of IFN-I blockade in the context of immunological memory, focusing on how short-term modulation of this path- way, specifically at the time of prime, affects susceptibility tofuture reinfections. We demonstrate across multiple viral sys-tems that short-term blockade of IFN-I improves immunologicalmemory and anamnestic immune protection. Notably, thispositive effect was also extended to clinically approved vac-cines, including YFV-17D, as well as experimental HIV-1 vac-cines. In this setting, we show that short-term IFN-I blockade improved the immune coverage afforded by HIV vaccines, rendering antibody responses better able to recognize variantenvelopes from different HIV clades. Although IFN-I -modulated vaccines seemed safe in mice, future studies are needed to evaluate safety in primates. IFN-Iblockers have already been used in humans to ameliorate in-flammatory diseases and have shown acceptable safety profiles(Casey et al., 2018 ;Felten et al., 2019 ;Tanaka et al., 2020 ). A reasonable counterargument against IFN-I -modulated vaccines, however, is that increasing vaccine replication creates a safetyconcern. Nevertheless, all acute viruses and vaccines werecompletely cleared within a week of injection. Moreover, short-term IFN-I blockade was followed by a compensatory IFN-I re-sponse, likely caused by a feedback mechanism and the transientoverload in antigen. Therefore, a single dose of IFNAR1 ad- ministered during the viral prime did not really \"block \"IFN-I responses per se; it just delayed the IFN-I response and actually reinforced it later throughout the effector phase of the immuneresponse. Interestingly, a prior study showed that \"pre-emptive IFN-I stimulation \"before T cell priming, known as out-of- sequence signal, impairs T cell activation ( Welsh et al., 2012 ). This suggests an additional mechanism by which delaying IFN-Isignaling may improve immune responses. Furthermore, wereason that the late IFN-I response likely contributes to the improved memory response because if the IFN-I pathway is absent long term, adaptive immune responses are severely im-paired and the host is unable to clear the acute viral infection(Teijaro et al., 2013 ;Wilson et al., 2013 ). Antigen is necessary for the elicitation of adaptive immunity. However, high antigen loads for a prolonged time induces in-hibitory mechanisms and is thus a main reason for immuneexhaustion during chronic infection ( Gallimore et al., 1998 ; Mueller and Ahmed, 2009 ;Penaloza-MacMaster et al., 2014 ; Penaloza-MacMaster, 2017 ). It is important to highlight that short-term IFN-I blockade instituted a different immune sce-nario: a drastic increase in antigen followed by rapid antigencontrol. These data suggest that a transient overload in antigenlevels \"raises the alarm \"on the immune system, improving antigen presentation and costimulation at a critical time whenthe adaptive immune system is getting primed. In particular, a transient increase in antigen levels during the first 72 h of a viral infection can induce a long-term potentiation of immunological Palacio et al. Journal of Experimental Medicine 9o f1 4 IFN-I modulation improves viral immunity https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20191220memory. These findings have not yet been validated in hu- mans, but previous clinical studies demonstrate a positive cor-relation between vaccine replication and vaccine immunogenicity(Akondy et al., 2015 ;Lin et al., 2020 ). Therefore, a logical as- sumption is that increasing vaccine dose would proportionallyincrease immunogenicity, but th is is not the case. We show that increasing vaccine dose above a certain level does not signifi- cantly augment immunogenicity because there is a natural limit on how much antigen can be expressed by infected cells, which iscritically influenced by IFN-I and not so much by the initial virusinoculum. Enhancing adaptive immunity by blocking an innate immune pathway seemingly violates the classical paradigm that a po-tent innate response gives rise to a potent adaptive response(Braciale and Hahn, 2013 ;Kadowaki et al., 2000 ;Medzhitov and Janeway, 1998 ;Pulendran et al., 2013 ). However, these two arms of the immune system do not always work in coop-eration. The innate protection conferred by IFN-I has beenhoned over millions of years to control the initial disseminationof viruses, conferring an immediate survival benefit to the host.Nevertheless, acute IFN-I responses can extinguish viral anti-gen prematurely, curtailing the elicitation of immunologicalmemory and thus limiting the future protection of the host. In conclusion, we show that coadministration of viral vaccines together with an IFN-I blocker results in profound improvement ofimmunological memory. Although the safety of IFN-I -modulated vaccines would need careful validation in primates, these findingsp r o v i d ei n s i g h t sf o rr a t i o n a lv a c c i n ed e s i g n ,a sw e l la saf r a m e w o r kto understand the tug of war bet ween innate immunity and im- munological memory. Materials and methods Mice, treatments, infection, and challengesFor Zika infection experiments, we used 4-wk-old mice (C57BL/6) since this facilitated intracranial challenges. In all other ex-periments, 6 -8-wk-old C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice were used. Mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (approximatelyhalf males and half females). Mice were immunized intramus- cularly (50 \u00b5l per quadriceps), subcutaneously right flank), or intranasally \u00b5l per nostril) with chased from BioXCell or Leinco and diluted in sterile PBS. 100 \u00b5gof antibody was administered, admixed together with each viralvector vaccine (as a single bolus). Zika challenges were performed intracranially with 10 4PFU. Supra-lethal bacterial challenges were performed with either LM-GP33 or LM-OVA at 107CFU intravenously via lateral tail vein injection using a mouse restrainer. Other viral challengesconsisted of 2 \u00d7 10 6PFU of VV-OVA through the intranasal route, 106PFU the route, or of MHV coronavirus through the intranasal route. Mice werehoused at the Northwestern University Center for ComparativeMedicine located in downtown Chicago. All mouse experiments were performed with approval of the Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Adoptive cell transfers and DC analyses For in vivo DC transfers, we generated bone marrow -derived DCs using a protocol similar to prior publications ( Penaloza- MacMaster et al., 2015 ;Wang et al., 2019 ). In brief, bone mar- row cells from wild-type or Ifnar1 /mice were cultured for 5 d in GM-CSF (Sigma) at 20 ng/ml to generate DCs. On day 5, themedia were aspirated and DCs were infected with LCMV Arm- strong at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05 in 1% FBS RPMI, gently rocking every 10 min. After 1 h, media were replaced with10% FBS DMEM. After 1 d of in vitro infection, DCs were washedfive times and injected intravenously into naive mice (2.5 \u00d7 10 5 DCs/mouse). CD8 T cell responses were evaluated after specificDC transfer. In Fig. 4, A and B , we used a DC cell line (DC 2.4) for imaging. Reagents, flow cytometry, and equipment Single-cell suspensions were obtained from peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tissues as previously described(Masopust et al., 2001 ). Dead cells were gated out using LIVE/ DEAD fixable dead cell stain (Invitrogen). The cytokine staining were obtained fromthe AIDS and all other peptides were fromAnaSpec or GenScript. MHC class I tetramers were obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tetramer facility at Emory University. Cells were stained with anti-CD8 (53-6.7 on PerCP-Cy5.5), purchased BD PharMingen, except for CD44 (which was from Bio-legend). Flow cytometry samples were acquired with a BectonDickinson Canto II or an LSRII and analyzed using FlowJo(Treestar). Virus-specific ELISA Virus-specific ELISA was done as described in prior publications (Dangi et al., 2020 ;Wang et al., 2019 ). In brief, 96-well flat- bottom plates (MaxiSorp; Thermo Scientific) were coated with100 \u00b5l/well of the respective viral lysate (e.g., Zika, YFV-17D,VSV, and MHV) diluted 1:10 in PBS for 48 h at room tempera-ture. Plates were washed with PBS + 0.5% Tween 20. Blockingwas performed for 2 h at room temperature with 200 \u00b5l of PBS +0.2% Tween 20 + 10% FCS. 5 \u00b5l of sera were added to 145 \u00b5l ofblocking solution in the first column of the plate, 1:3 serial di- lutions were performed until row 12 for each sample, and plates were incubated for 90 min at room temperature. Plates werewashed three times followed by addition of goat anti-mouse IgGconjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotech) at 100 \u00b5l/well and incubated for90 min at room temperature. Plates were washed three times,and 100 \u00b5l/well of Sure Blue substrate (SeraCare) was added for8 min. Reaction was stopped using 100 \u00b5l/well of KPL TMB Stop Solution (SeraCare). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Spectramax Plus 384 (Molecular Devices). Palacio et al.

Plates were washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20. Blockingwas performed for 4 h at room temperature with 200 \u00b5l of PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 + bovine serum albumin. 6 \u00b5l of sera were added to 144 \u00b5l of blocking solution in the first column of theplate, 1:3 serial dilutions were performed until row 12 for eachsample, and plates were incubated for 60 min at room temper-ature. Plates were washed three times followed by addition ofgoat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to (1:5,000) at100 \u00b5l/well and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Plates were washed three times, and 100 \u00b5l/well of Sure Blue substrate (SeraCare) was added for 8 min. Reaction was stoppedusing 100 \u00b5l/well of KPL TMB Stop Solution (SeraCare). Ab-sorbance measured a 384(Molecular Devices). TZM-bl assays TZM-bl cells (a HeLa cell line engineered to express human receptors and coreceptors for HIV, in addition to a Tat-inducible luciferase gene) were used to measure vaccine-induced antibodyneutralization of SIV. TZM-bl cells were cultured in T75 flasks(Thermo Scientific) at 10 4cell/ml density for 3 d in 10% FBS complete DMEM (GIBCO). On the day of the 1:20 serialfold dilutions of mouse sera were performed. Sera SIVmac251.TCLA pseudovirus for 30 min in low-evaporation 96-well clear plates (Corning). TZM-bl cells were detached from flasks using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO) and seeded at a density of 0.5 \u00d7 10 6/ml per well. On the following day, 10% FBS complete DMEM (GIBCO) was added to eachwell. At day 3, media were aspirated, and cells were lysedusing luciferase cell culture lysis buffer (Promega). Lucifer-ase reaction was performed using 30 \u00b5l of cell lysis (Prom-ega). The reaction was added to 96-well black optiplates (PerkinElmer). Luminescence was measured using a Perkin Elmer Victor 3luminometer. Bacterial quantification To quantify LM in liver, brain heart infusion agar containing50 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin was prepared and of agar/well). LM-GP33 and LM-OVA possess a strepto-mycin resistance gene. Liver was harvested and collected in14-ml round-bottom tubes (Falcon) with 5 ml of 1% FBS DMEM (without antibiotics). Tissue was passed through a 100-\u00b5m strainer (Scientific Inc.) using 1% Triton X-100 solution. 50 \u00b5lof serial dilutions were added on each brain heart infusion agarwell. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. CFU were countedthe next day. Viral quantification Quantification of LCMV on Vero E6 cell monolayers was done as described in prior publications ( Dangi et al., 2020 ;Wang et al., 2019 ). In brief, Vero E6 cells were grown on 10 5cells/ml. After cells reached 90% confluency, media were removed and 200 \u00b5l of 10-fold viral dilutions in 1% DMEM(GIBCO) were pipetted on top of the cell monolayers. Plates wererocked every 10 min in a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2incubator. After 60 min, media were aspirated, and the monolayers were overlaid with a1:1 solution of 2 \u00d7 199 media and 1% agarose. After 4 d of culturein a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2incubator, a second overlay was added con- sisting of a 1:1 solution of 2 \u00d7 199 media and 1% agarose with neutral red. The agar overlay was removed on day 5, and plaqueswere counted using a transilluminator (Gradco). Quantificationof titers exceptthat the agar overlay was removed after 1 d and 1% crystal violetwas added on top of the monolayers, incubated for 1 h at roomtemperature, and then washed with H 2O. MHV viral quantifi- cation was similar to VSV, but overlay was removed 2 d after infection. Quantification of YFV-17D titers was similar to quantification of LCMV titers except that the agar overlay wasremoved after 5 d and 1% crystal violet was added on top of themonolayers, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and thenwashed with H 2O. For quantification of vaccinia, we followed the protocol by Dr. Bernard Moss ( Cotter et al., 2017 ). For viral load quantification in muscle, both quadriceps were harvestedand collected in round-bottom tubes (Falcon) containing 3 ml of 1% FBS DMEM (GIBCO). Muscle tissue was processed using a Tissue Ruptor homogenizer (Qiagen). Lungs and brains wereharvested and collected in (Falcon) con-taining clari-fied using a 100-\u00b5m strainer (Scientific Inc.) to remove debris. Viruses LCMV-expressing SIVmac239 antigens (Gag and Env), GFP, or OVA were from Hookipa Biotech and were produced as de-scribed previously ( Kallert et al., 2017 ). were Hookipa Biotech. nonreplicatingLCMV vectors contained the LCMV glycoprotein gene in trans,which resulted in a single round of infection ( Penaloza MacMaster et al., 2017 ). Replicating LCMV-HIV vectors were constructed with help from the De La Torre (Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA) and Waggoner (University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH) laboratories.The nonreplicating Ad5 vector is E1/E3 deleted and expressesHIV-1 gp140 domains from HIV-1 Bal, and was obtainedfrom the Mascola laboratory (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The VSV-OVA used in this study was obtained from Dr. Vaiva Vezys(University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN)and was derived from a stock from Dr. Leo Lefrancois 'labora- tory (University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT). The nonreplicating VSV vector (VSV- G) that contains the G protein in trans was a gift from Dr. Connie Cepko (HarvardMedical School, Boston, MA). The acute LCMV Armstrongstrain was propagated from a stock from Dr. Rafi Ahmed 'sl a b o - ratory (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). Dr. Bernard Moss and Dr.Patricia Earl (NIH) provided the poxviruses. The following re-agents were obtained through t he NIH Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository, NIAID, and NIH (BEI Resources): YFV-17D, NR-115; Zika virus, PRVABC59 (Puerto Rico Palacio et al.

Mouse betacoronaviruses (MHV-A59 strain) were a gift from Dr.Susan Weiss (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Murine IFN 2 293F mammalian cells were transfected with mIFN 2 expression vector (Addgene ID 135098). IFN 2 purification was performed by cation exchange chromatography using a HiTrap SP column (General Electric). Purified recombinant mIFN 2w a s quantified by an IFN mouse used. Cells were plated in clear flat-bottom 96-wellplates at a density of 10 cells were treated with 20 \u00b5g of IgG control or IFNAR1 an- tibodies for 30 min. Media were removed from each well using amultichannel pipette, and cells were infected with LCMV-GFP orMHV-GFP in 50 \u00b5l of 1% FBS DMEM (GIBCO) for 1 h,gently rocking every 10 min. Media were removed and 5% CO 2for 72 h. C e l l sw e r ew a s h e do n c ea n df i x e dw i t h4 %p a r a f o r m a l d e h y d e (Thermo Scientific). A Vectashield mounting medium containingDAPI (Vector Labs) was added to the wells, and images were ac-quired using an EVOS FL digital inverted microscope (ThermoScientific). RNA-Seq data acquisition and analysis Gene expression profiling was performed as shown previously (Barnitz et al., 2013 ;Penaloza-MacMaster et al., 2015 ;Quigley et al., 2010 ;Wang et al., 2019 ). In brief, C57BL/6 mice were in- tramuscularly immunized with 10 4PFU of LCMV, and at day 7, splenic CD8 T cells were MACS (magnetic activated cell sorting)sorted with a MACS negative selection kit (STEMCELL). PurifiedCD8 T cells were stained with D bGP33 tetramer, live dead stain, and flow cytometry antibodies for CD8 and CD44 to gate onactivated CD8 cells. +,C 4 4+,a n dDbGP33+cells were purity on FACS Aria cytometer (BD Biosciences) and stored at -80\u00b0C in 1 ml of TRIzol (Life Sciences).RNA extraction was performed with the RNAdvance TissueIsolation kit (Agencourt). RNA quality and RNA-Seq down-stream analyses were performed at the NUSeq core at North-western University. For analysis, adapters were trimmed fromreads using cutadapt version 1.13 and aligned to 10 mm usingSTAR version 020201. For gene counting, htseq-count version 0.6.1p1 was used, and differential expression analysis was con- ducted using DESeq2 version 1.14.1. RNA-Seq data were up-loaded into the GEO database (accession no. GSE129827) in arecord titled \"Gene expression comparison of splenic virus- specific CD8 T cells after infection with LCMV vector andtreatment with IgG or aIFNAR1. \" Statistical analysis Most statistical analyses used the Mann-Whitney test, unless specified otherwise in the figure legend. Survival plot analyseswere performed using the Mantel-Cox test. Dashed lines in plaque assay and ELISA plots represent the limit of detection.Data were analyzed using Prism (Graphpad).
