Even if you're not rarin' to have sex while your symptoms are still wreaking havoc down below, it's reasonable to wonder about the various ways a UTI might screw with your [sex](https://www.self.com/sex-love/sex) life from now until recovery. For example, can you have sex on antibiotics? Are you good to go once your symptoms are gone? Is it possible to catch a second UTI while still recovering from your first one? The list goes on. If you're curious about all of the above and you're making decisions about your sex life while dealing with a UTI, here's a crash course in everything you need to know. First, we need to knock out a few UTI FAQs. Understanding some UTI basics is key to making informed decisions about UTI sex, so it's all relevant, I promise. Plus, UTIs are pretty common, so it's good to have information about them in your (mental) back pocket anyway. The [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-infection-uti-in-adults/definition-facts#:~:text=is%20called%20pyelonephritis.-,How%20common%20are%20bladder%20infections%3F,to%20have%20a%20repeat%20infection) (NIDDK) suggests that 40 to 60 percent of people with vaginas will get a UTI at some point. A UTI is an infection in any part of your urinary tract. Your urinary tract includes your kidneys, ureters (tubes that connect your kidneys to your bladder), bladder, and urethra (the tube through which you pee), according to the [NIDDK](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/urinary-tract-how-it-works). A UTI can crop up in any of these places, though they typically happen when bacteria from your gastrointestinal tract migrates from your anus to your bladder (this is known as cystitis) or urethra (urethritis), according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447). UTIs are what's known as \"ascending infections,\" according to the [Merck Manual](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/genitourinary-disorders/urinary-tract-infections-utis/bacterial-urinary-tract-infections), meaning the bacteria maintains an upward trajectory for as long as it can until antibiotics stamp out the infection. Left untreated, bacteria can travel from your lower urinary tract to your kidneys, where it can cause permanent damage or sepsis, a potentially life-threatening infection. Speaking of, there are also two important categories of UTIs to know about: uncomplicated or complicated. Having an uncomplicated UTI basically means it's a straightforward infection that hasn't compromised your kidneys, isn't [recurrent](https://www.self.com/story/8-things-you-should-know-if-you-get-recurrent-utis) (which means you don't get two or more in a six-month period or four or more within a year), and doesn't present any other complex factors that can make it harder to treat, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447). UTIs don't always come with symptoms, but more often than not they do. Here are some of the most common symptoms, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447): - A need to [pee frequently](https://www.self.com/story/peeing-all-the-time-causes) [Burning pee](https://www.self.com/story/why-it-burns-when-you-pee) - Peeing often but only in small amounts - Pee that has a [cloudy appearance](https://www.self.com/story/cloudy-pee-causes) - Pee that looks red, bright pink, or brown - Pee that has a strong odor - Pain in your pelvic region, especially toward the middle Symptoms can vary depending on the area infected; an infection in your urethra/ureters can cause burning with urination accompanied by abnormal discharge and cloudy pee, the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447) says. One in your bladder can cause pelvic pressure; pain in your lower abdomen; frequent, painful urination; and blood in your pee. And if the infection spreads to your kidneys, you can experience upper back and side pain, a high fever, shaking and chills, nausea, and vomiting. (If you're experiencing these symptoms, get thee to a doctor ASAP, please.) One word for you: Bacteria. UTIs happen when bacteria travel to some part of your urinary tract via your urethra, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447). (As we mentioned, this most commonly happens when bacteria from your GI tract makes its way to your bladder.) Unfortunately, having a [vagina](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/vaginal-health) makes you more likely to get a UTI. This is because of two purely anatomical reasons: The urethra and anus are close together, and the urethral opening is shorter in vaginas than it is in penises. When you have sex or make the dreadful (yet easy) mistake of [wiping back to front](https://www.self.com/story/wipe-front-to-back), bacteria don't have far to go in order to cause trouble in your urinary system. Getting a sexually transmitted infection such as herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, or mycoplasma can also allow bacteria to get into your urethra and cause urethritis, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447). But other risk factors, like [menopause](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/menopause), also boost the prevalence of UTIs in people with vaginas. Menopause-related declines in estrogen can promote these infections, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447). Having poorly controlled [diabetes](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/type-2-diabetes) or other diseases that weaken your immune system can also increase your risk of getting UTIs. Alright, now here's everything you need to know about sex and UTIs. The answer to the question \"Can I have sex with a UTI?\" depends on a few factors, so you'll have to forgive me for being long-winded here. To start, I can tell you that yes, under certain circumstances, it's safe to have sex with a UTI. But before you run off, we have to dive into the nitty-gritty. Sex or not, you should be doing this anyway. Like we said earlier, UTIs don't just go away on their own and treatment is your first priority to prevent dangerous complications. Once you've visited your [gynecologist](https://www.self.com/story/first-gyno-exam-tips) and they've confirmed via testing that you have a UTI, much of their treatment plan will depend on the type of bacteria causing the infection and whether your infection is uncomplicated or complicated. If your UTI is uncomplicated, your doctor will prescribe an oral antibiotic, per the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353453). Just a few days of antibiotic treatment should clear symptoms from this kind of infection, Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., clinical professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the Yale University School of Medicine, tells SELF. If you get recurrent or otherwise complicated UTIs, your ob-gyn might recommend a different course of care depending on your specific situation. This might include low-dose antibiotics for six months or more or a single-dose antibiotic you can take after you have sex, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353453). And whether or not you get UTIs a lot, if your infection seems to have spread to your kidneys, you may need to see a specialist or go to the hospital, where they can administer strong enough antibiotics to beat the illness, according to the [NIDDK](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/kidney-infection-pyelonephritis/treatment). \"If you have an infection and it's being treated, you don't need to abstain [from intercourse] unless you want to,\" [Lauren Streicher](https://www.drstreicher.com/about/), M.D., an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, tells SELF. The bacteria have already gotten where they shouldn't, the infection has already started, and you're already on antibiotics to get that shit cleared up, so generally, you're good to go. That said, your symptoms actually need to be gone in order to make this a good idea, otherwise sexual activity could just make the area more [irritated](https://www.self.com/story/sensitive-vagina-facts). \"If you have UTI symptoms, you're probably not going to even want to have sex,\" board-certified ob-gyn Jacques Moritz, M.D., tells SELF. Feeling like you need to sprint to the nearest toilet every other second isn't exactly turn-on material. (Neither is pelvic pain. Same goes for an on-fire urinary tract. You get the idea.) Even if your symptoms are gone, the [infection](https://www.self.com/topic/infections) might not be. It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment your UTI clears up, Dr. Minkin says. This is why it's always essential to finish the entire course of prescribed medication. It will help make sure you actually kick the infection (not just the symptoms), and if you're deciding to go ahead with sex, it also makes it less likely that you'll get another UTI. Yup, you read that right: Getting a second UTI while still recovering from the first UTI is technically possible, but Dr. Minkin says being on medication for your current UTI lowers the odds drastically. \"If you've got an antibiotic around, it's probably going to take care of any potential organisms that might be thinking of invading,\" Dr. Minkin says. One last thing: You probably don't need to worry about your UTI [antibiotics interfering with your birth control](https://www.self.com/story/can-antibiotics-make-your-birth-control-fail). While it's true that some antibiotics like rifampin (for treating tuberculosis) and griseofulvin (for treating fungal infections) have been shown to decrease the efficacy of hormonal [contraception](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/contraception), there's no solid scientific evidence that common UTI drugs will do the same. That said, it's not a bad idea to ask your doctor or pharmacist about the specific antibiotic you're prescribed to see if it has any contraindications with your chosen birth control method. And, if you're really concerned, you can either use a backup method of birth control or postpone sex altogether. So, yeah, you can go ahead and have sex with a UTI while on antibiotics if you're following your prescribed UTI treatment course and symptoms have hightailed it out of your body. But if you're still unsure, you can always check in with your doctor for peace of mind. And don't forget: There are things you can do to prevent getting a UTI in the future. Once you've gotten your first UTI, you'll probably want to avoid them like the plague in the future. Here are some steps you can take to reduce your risk of UTIs, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447): - Stay hydrated: Drinking lots of liquids\u2014especially water\u2014can help stave off UTIs. The reason: You'll have to pee more often, which better ensures bacteria will be flushed from your urinary tract. - Wipe carefully: Make sure you're wiping from front to back. Doing so will help keep bacteria from your anal region from entering your vagina and urethra. - Pee after sex: This will help flush out any bacteria that may have set up shop around your urethra. - Don't use anything scented down there: Products that have a fragrance\u2014including tampons and douches, the latter of which you don't need, BTW\u2014can irritate your genitals and urethra. - Maybe switch up your birth control method: Certain [birth control](https://www.self.com/story/stop-period-birth-control)methods may make you more likely to get a UTI because of how they affect your vaginal flora, like diaphragms "}
