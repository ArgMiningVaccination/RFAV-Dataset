Revolutionise your energy with our 14 Day Guided Cleanse, including yoga, community support and full cleanse manual.", "sitename": null, "date": "2018-01-26", "cleaned_text": "The last 2 years have challenged us in many ways, and the impact of this is largely unseen in our bodies. The consequences of reduced physical activity and comfort eating are obvious, but emotional and mental strain creates toxic chemistry and structures within the body which are unseen. The 14 Day Cleanse will help you reboot your system - helping you free yourself from any bad lockdown habits, clearing out toxicity from the year, and setting you up for a better 2022 - in body and mind! If you crave that light, clean feeling that comes with having a body that's nourished and toxin free, and want the kind of energy that allows you to get the most out of life (whatever it throws at you), then it's time to cleanse. This 14 Day Guided Program will clean your body and reboot your whole system: stabilising your blood sugar levels, unleashing your energy, strengthening your immune and digestive systems, losing toxic weight, and improving your mental and emotional state. \"Doing the cleanse for me brought about changes which I wasn't expecting such as being more mindful, deep sleep, better mental clarity and inner calm. I thought I was just changing what I ate but it had a huge impact on my emotional wellbeing....it's one thing to know in theory what is healthy to eat (and actually I realise I didn't even know that!), but it's another thing to embody the process of nurturing yourself and then seeing the benefits.\" - SS Your body will give you clear messages when it's functioning below optimum and needs to cleanse: Bloating after eating Easy weight gain, especially around your belly Excess weight that won't shift with diet or exercise Regular headaches Tiredness and lethargy throughout the day and / or restlessness at night Sugar, caffeine or starchy food cravings Digestive issues including gas, diarrhea, constipation or intestinal pain Problems sleeping Mood swings, anxiety or depression and lack of motivation Difficulty focusing or brain fog Allergies of hayfever Muscle aches, and pain or stiffness in your joints Regular or frequent infections, throat or sinus problems Excessive sweat, skin eruptions, rashes or hair loss If you're thinking these are all normal symptoms that you and everyone experience everyday, think again! These are signs that your body is operating at well below its potential good health. It really doesn't have to be that way! This gentle cleanse is based on a hypoallergenic elimination diet that nourishes your body with as much delicious, fresh and satisfying food as you want. It's not about starving or depriving it. You'll focus on nutrients, not count calories! It's also a great opportunity to get curious about your body, and discover the impact of food and your thoughts on your whole being. The Cleanse will help you to... Feel cleaner, lighter and more positive Sleep better and wake feeling refreshed Identify food intolerances and sensitivities that are causing bloating or IBS Get clear glowing skin Lose 'toxic' weight Break addictions like sugar, caffeine and processed foods Discover emotional eating habits Reboot your immune system and balance hormones Kick your metabolism in to gear Increase sex drive Feel more balanced and positive emotionally You'll complete the cleanse feeling more empowered in your food choices, with healthier eating habits, higher energy levels, and more positive, balanced emotions. The Cleanse is structured to integrate in to your life, and set you up for success. Phase 1: 2-Day Pre-Cleanse Prep We'll kick off in earnest with a 2.5hr Online Cleanse Workshop - Saturday 15th January 1.30 - 4.00pm. (There'll be a replay if you can't make it). You'll get information about how to Cleanse, which foods are included (and which aren't), and you'll set clear intentions and connect to your motivation. You'll be set up for success and learn how to avoid common cleansing mistakes. If you order your shopping online, don't worry. You'll get a guide on what kind of foods to buy before the workshop. Phase 2: The 7-Day Cleanse You have the weekend to shop before the Cleanse starts on the Monday. In this phase you'll follow the Cleanse diet plan, recipes and body cleanse practices. You'll get daily guidance and support on changes you may experience in your body and how to handle any cravings that show up. There'll also be daily content on how to support your body whilst it cleanses. Phase 3: 7 Day Re-Introduction Coming out of the Cleanse is one of the most important phases. You'll identify any food sensitivities and intolerances, and create an ongoing diet that best serves the unique needs of your body. Your learnings will be cemented in a closing workshop on Sunday 30th January 1.30 - 3.30pm. (Again a replay will be available). Yoga supports the detoxification and healing process, and is the ideal cleanse-support activity. We recommend attending 3 yoga classes a week, ideally more. You can add a 14 day unlimited yoga pass for our livestreamed and studio yoga classes as part of the Cleanse Package. Stress creates toxic chemistry within your body. Whilst cleansing, the aim is to minimize toxins introduced to the body from any source - including your own thoughts and situation. Our intention is to get you out of a stress response (\"fight or flight\"), and calm your nervous system so your body can give energy to cleansing and repairing. Breathing and meditation are the most effective ways to do this, and you'll be shown how to achieve this throughout your day... Within minutes. Any program is more effective when there's the accountability and support of a group. You'll go through the Cleanse as a group and be part of a private Facebook community where you'll be given daily guidance and support, get your questions answered and be coached on any issues that come up. It's given me a solid foundation to approach bigger lifestyle changes \"I have a better understanding of the correlation between body and mind, and diet and mood. Also, a more positive association with the concept of detox - it's a treat rather than a challenge. It's given me a solid foundation on which to approach bigger lifestyle changes, such as career.\" Claire M The Cleanse is just the beginning \"The Cleanse has made a positive impact on my mental outlook. It's helped me better deal with my daily stress, and understand how this impacts my body and behaviour. The Cleanse is just the beginning, as everything I've observed and learned, I will take forward with me to improve my quality of life.\" Ana Eliasen I have learned so much about how my body affects my mind \"The Cleanse has really helped me to address issues in my life in a different, more positive way. I have learned so much about how my body affects my mind and the importance of self care. Focusing on nourishing my body properly has given me tons more energy.\" Laura Cochrane The Cleanse is for you if you want to see rapid results and also long term benefits, not only in terms of supporting your overall wellbeing, but also in strengthening your immune system.

Jill opened her mind to more natural and 'alternative' healing methods over 25 years ago, when she discovered she had Candidiasis - which conventional doctors sought to treat with toxic drugs that were damaging to her liver. She embarked on a voyage of self-healing using nutrition and complementary medicines. Following burn-out in her late 30's, she became even more passionate about diet, lifestyle and the pursuit of good health. Her passion became how to achieve this within the demands of the modern world and a busy lifestyle. Now almost 50, as a Health Coach, Life Coach and Emotional Healer, she combines her extensive knowledge around diet, nutrition, yoga and wellbeing practices, with a genuine understanding of the pressures and stresses of modern corporate life. Q. Does the cleanse involve any fasting? No. The cleanse is designed to nourish you and satisfy hunger cravings in a healthy way, so there are none of the feelings or hunger associated with a fast. This cleanse will help you figure out a diet that is optimal for your body's unique needs, and which will become part of a healthier lifestyle. Q. Will I be given recipes for what to eat during the cleanse? Yes, you'll be given recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as ideas for snacks and treats. All these recipes are designed to be tasty, satisfying and nourishing. Q. Will I need to cut out caffeine and sugar? Yep - processed sugar is at the root of many 21st Century physical and mental illnesses, so you'll cut it out. As you nourish your body and balance your blood sugar you'll find your cravings disappear. Caffeine causes a lot of stress in your body and stops you being able to connect to your real energy levels, so you'll also cut caffeine out during your cleanse. Q. Will I lose weight during the cleanse? Most people lose 'toxic' weight and water retention associated with food intolerances and hormone imbalances. This Cleanse isn't concerned with counting calories, starving or depriving you, but rather minimising your toxic input, nourishing you and giving your body support to clean and heal. The amount of weight you lose will be unique to you, and will be sustainable as you uncover conscious eating habits. Q. Will I be hungry on the cleanse? I hope not! You'll be given recipes for cleansing and healthy meals and snacks. We're aiming not only to cleanse your body but also create sustainable healthy eating habits. Hunger and deprivation increase the likelihood of you reaching for sugar, carbs and toxic treats, so nothing is gained from you being hungry, and our aim is for you to feel nourished and satisfied during the cleanse. Q. Can I eat meat on the cleanse? We recommend that the cleanse is vegan, however, it's possible for you to eat small amounts of fish or chicken without having a negative effect on the cleanse. Q. I think I have some food sensitivities, will I discover what these are? Yes, phase 3 of the cleanse includes a reintroduction plan, which is designed to test how your body responds to certain foods. Q. Can the cleanse be done during pregnancy or nursing? As I don't know how clean your diet currently is, or the toxic load you're carrying, I don't recommend you do this cleanse if you're pregnant or nursing. Any toxins released will find their way through the placenta or in to your milk, so it is best to wait until later. Q. I already have a membership for yoga classes. What will happen to this whilst I'm on the cleanse? You may want to use your existing pass / membership or put yours on hold, depending on how many classes it allows you to take. The results have far exceeded my expectations \"Do it! The results for me have far exceeded my expectations. I am lighter, happier, glowing and with more energy. Jill is pragmatic and well informed. She doesn't make you feel like you have to be perfect and understands you are on your own journey. She is a role model for how to live a healthy but realistic life prioritising your health!\" RLT I feel cleaner and have more energy \"I've gone from 7 cups of coffee a day to just 3 per week. I feel cleaner and have more energy, and discovered some unexpected food sensitivities. The cleanse made such a difference to me that it inspired my wife to join me in eating in a healthier way. We're now both integrating the principles in to our lifestyle.\" Paul Chadder I loved the feeling of really taking care of myself \"I discovered things about my body and mind that I wasn't aware of, which is crazy!! How can I live in my body and treat it as a stranger?! I loved the feeling of really taking care of myself. I feel inspired to carry on the good habits and share them.\" Elisa Laffi I can't believe the changes I've experienced \"This is a truly transformational programme! I can't believe the changes I have experienced in just two weeks - no bloating, tummy ache, better skin, mood, overall wellbeing (in particular feeling so much more confident and happy in my body). Jill is an amazing coach and guided us through every stage with expertise and compassion. She gave us tons of input and answered all our questions, and also helped bond us as a group - and the group support was fantastic. Thank you Jill!\" EB I feel amazing for having done it! \"The Cleanse is such a brilliant investment in time and money.
