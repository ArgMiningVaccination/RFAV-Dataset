Dr Peter Crook from the Environment Agency provided overall project management on behalf of the sponsor s. A consortium led by the University of Liverpool's School of Biological Sciences was commissioned to undertake the work. The primary aim of the project was to establish a baseline for pollutant levels in soil and herbage in the UK. The three-year project has led to wealth of data and the results are presented in a series of 11 reports. This report, No. 6 in the UKSHS report series, discusses the spatial variability of soil contaminant data and was conducted to justify the UKSHS soil sampling methodology (see UKSHS ReportNo. 2). An evaluation is also made of the spatia l variance of soil contaminant data compared with the 'uncertainty of measurement' of soil cont aminants in laboratory analyses (see UKSHS Report No. 3 which describes the analytical methodologies used in the UKSHS). The results generated by this intensive sampling study indicate that field sampling uncertainties lie well within the ranges of uncertainties found in other studies. The semivariograms produced in this study for soil properties, inorganic contaminants and organic contaminants were found to be unstable. This was thought to be due to the small sample size and because the areas betweenlags of 150-300 m on the sampling grid were under-sampled. Despite this, the form of thevariograms confirms that the chosen scale of sub-sampling (three sub-samples collected within20 m of each other) at each rural and urban location in the main UKSHS Project (see UKSHS Report No. 2) would have captured the greater part of any spatial dependence in soil contaminants for a wide range of inorganic determinands. Large variations in the example UKSHS organic c ontaminants, illustrated by the semivariograms, indicate that a much larger dataset, collected over a more intensive and more closely spacedsampling grid, would be required to detect spatial patterns in organic contaminants.Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey ivContents Executive Summary iii Contents iv Glossary of terms v List of abbreviations and acronyms vi 1 Introduction 1 2 Purpose and methodology for assessing spatial variability of soil contaminants 2 2.1 Purpose of the intensive sampling survey 2 2.2 Methodology of the intensive sampling survey 3 2.3 Field sampling and laboratory analyses for the intensive sampling survey 3 2.4 Methodology for data analyses for the intensive sampling survey 43 Spatial variability of selected soil properties and contaminants 9 3.1 Preliminary comments on spatial variability 103.2 Spatial variability of three soil properties 10 3.3 Spatial variability of selected inorganic soil contaminants 12 3.4 Spatial variability of selected organic soil contaminants 12 4 Comparison of 'uncertainties' associated with field sampling and laboratory analyses 15 4.1 Introduction 154.2 Uncertainty of field sampling and laboratory measurement 15 4.2.1 Uncertainty of measurement (UoM) 15 4.2.2 Relative standard deviations (%RSDs) 16 4.3 Uncertainty associated with inorganic determinands 17 4.4 Uncertainty associated with organic determinands 17 4.5 Conclusions 175 Comparing the assessment of spatial variability for the UKSHS with that of previous studies 25 5.1 Spatial variability of inorganic soil contaminants. 255.2 Spatial variability of organic soil contaminants. 25 6 Conclusions 26 References 27 Appendix 1Semivariograms for inorganic determinands 28 Appendix 2Full soil for intensive sampling project 29 Appendix 3Full inorganics dataset for intensive soil sampling project 31 Appendix 4Full organics dataset for intensive soil sampling project 33Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey vGlossary of terms Base position South west corner of a northerly orientated 20 m x 20 m sampling area from which GPS readings and triangulation bearings were taken.

Dr Peter Crook from the Environment Agency provided overall project management on behalf of the sponsors. A consortium led by the University of Liverpool's School of Biological Sciences was commissioned to undertake the work. The consortium consisted of the Environment Agency'sNational Laboratory Service (NLS), Nottingham Trent University, the University of Stirling and the University of Liverpool (UoL), with additi onal assistance being provided by Parkman Ltd. The project's primary objective was to establish a baseline for pollutant levels in soil and herbage in the UK. The UKSHS has involved the collection of soil and herbage samples for chemical andradiometric analysis from industrial, rural and urban sites throughout the UK. Full details of the number of samples/sites visited and sampling techniques used are given in UKSHS Report No. 1. The scale of the UKSHS has resulted in a wealth of methodological information and analytical data. This made the presentation of the whole study in one report unwieldy and a series of 12stand-alone reports has therefore been prepared, which users can read individually or as a complete set. This report discusses the spatial variability of soil contaminant data and is Report No. 6 in the series. Full details of the other reports in the series can be found on the CD-ROMincluded with UKSHS Report No. 1 or from the Environment Agency website ( www.environment- agency.gov.uk ). The objectives of this report are to: indicate the purpose of, and outline the approach for, carrying out an assessment of spatial variability of soil contaminants both inorganic and organic (Section 2); indicate and assess the spatial variability of selected soil properties and soil contaminants (Section 3); assess the appropriateness of the UKSHS soil sampling scheme in relation to prevailing spatial variability of soil properties and soil contaminants (Section 4); compare levels of contaminant spatial variability in the UKSHS with 'uncertainty of measurement' estimates evaluated for the UKSHS' laboratory analyses (Section 4). compare levels of contaminant spatial variability in the UKSHS with the results of previous studies (where available) in order to evaluate UKSHS conditions against those obtainedelsewhere (Section 5).Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 22 Purpose and methodology for assessing spatial variability ofsoil contaminants This section describes: the purpose of the UKSHS intensive sampling study; the methodology used to assess in situ spatial variability of soil properties and soil contaminants. The methodology section describes the location of the study, the field sampling procedures adopted and the statistical analyses used. 2.1 Purpose of the in tensive sampling survey The distribution of various contaminants in soils is likely to depend on a range of different factors including: local rock type; proximity of urban centres, industrial developments and/or roads; previous additives to the soil; previous uses of land on or adjacent to the site. In addition to these factors, other influences such as air pollution have affected the quality of surface soils over hundreds of years. Soil proper ties themselves determine the aeration, moisture status and ion retention ability of different soils. The interaction of all of these influencescontributes to both the spatial and temporal variability of soil contaminants. There are many reasons why knowledge of the spatial variability of soil properties and soil contaminants is important. For the UKSHS, the pr ime purpose in assessing the spatial variability of a few basic soil properties and organic and inorganic soil contaminants was to make aninformed decision about the most appropriate spatial scale for soil sampling at sites across theUK. When estimating spatial variability in soil properties, it is often possible to detect a directional bias in different properties as a result, for example, of the predominant direction of wind (blowing aplume of air pollution) or the direction of a geological outcrop. It may even be possible tointerpolate values of soil properties at locations on a map that were not sampled. The reliability ofsuch assessments depends on the degree of variability found in a large number of samples(usually taken from >100 points) sampled over a grid of locations whose nearest neighbour distances range from several metres to several hundreds of metres. Ideally, spatial variability assessments should be carried out in each location where further field sampling is anticipated. Since it is impossible to predict whether the spatial variance of soilproperties and soil contaminants will be similar, spatial variability assessments should also be made for each determinand at each different location. For the UKSHS this would, of course, not be possible since it would mean the sampling and analysis of an impossibly large number ofsamples.Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 3For this reason, the UKSHS intensive sampling study examined the spatial variability of three soil properties, plus all the soil chemical determinands included within the main UKSHS study (13metals/metalloids, 26 polychlorinated biphenyls, 22 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 17dioxins) at one location only. 2.2 Methodology of the intensive sampling survey There are three components to the methodology: field soil sampling laboratory analyses data analysis and interpretation. These three stages are described in Sections 2.3 and 2.4. 2.3 Field sampling and laboratory analyses for the intensive sampling survey A location, 1000 m x 700 m, at Tatton Park, Cheshire, was chosen for carrying out the intensive sampling study. Tatton Park is part of a National Trust estate and was selected because the soil at this site was relatively undisturbed and not subject to any obvious direct source of pollution (e.g. there is no heavy industrial activity on the land bordering the site). Thus any contaminationat the site is likely to be due to aerial deposition from ambient air contamination. Spatial variability should therefore be a reflection of the natural variability in the soil rather than due to contaminantplume grounding. The soil in this location is described by the So il Survey of England and Wales (SSEW) as Wick 1 Association (Jarvis 1984). Wick 1 Association is a deep, well-drained coarse loamy and sandysoil generally over glacio-fluvial or river terrace drift. Soil samples were collected from the field site according to the methods outlined in UKSHS Report No. 2. These samples were then prepared in the laboratory prior to analysis according to the methodologies outlined in UKSHS Report Nos. 3 and 4. The samples were analysed for: soil properties (soil bulk density, soil organic matter, soil organic carbon and pH); metals analytical results are provided in Appendices 2, 3 and 4. Seventy soil samples were collected on a grid as laid out in Figure 2.1. A theodolite and ranging pole were used, in conjunction with tape measures, to ensure that the distances betweensamples were measured accurately. This grid was designed to capture all variation found at bothshort spatial scales (<10 m) and larger spatial scales (hundreds of metres). There was no information available on the likely soil spatial vari ability at the survey site prior to this project.Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 42.4 Methodology for data analyses for the intensive sampling survey Variation in soil properties over short and long distances has been recognised by soil scientists for many years. Matheron (1971) first brought t ogether a number of statistical approaches into a coherent method for analysing the spatial variability of properties in geology and earth scienceswhen he introduced his theory of regionalised variables. Techniques for the analysis of spatialvariability of soil properties have been refined over the past 2-3 decades and have been amplydescribed, discussed and illustrated for UK soils by authors such as Burgess and Webster (1980), Webster (1985), Oliver (1987), and Oliver and Webster (1991). Use of these techniques for choosing and optimising soil sampling schemes was discussed and defined by McBratney et al. (1981), and has subsequently become an important preliminary stage in most large-scale soil sampling projects. Our basic premise on the variability of a soil pr operty is that we would expect data from points close to each other to exhibit strong similarity , then progressively less similarity as distances increase. This is a pattern of high autocorrelation of data at points close together withautocorrelation decreasing as distance increases.Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 51234 5 6 7 891011 12 13 14 15161718 19 20 21 22232425 26 27 28 29303132 33 34 35 36373839 40 41 4243444546 47 48 4950515253 54 55 565757.1585960 61 62 6364656667 68 69 70 0 200 400 600 X direction (metres )02004006008001000Y direction (m) Figure 2.1 - Sampling grid for the intensive survey at Tatton Hall, Cheshire: 70 sample locations taken over a 1000 m x 700 m gridEnvironment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 6The semivariogram is the statistical technique used in the analysis of soil data in this intensive sampling project. The calculation and production of a semivariogram for a soil property involved anumber of steps: 1. Calculation of nearest neighbour distances (called lags - see below) for every point on the selected field sampling grid 2. Calculation of the spatial autocorrelation (Geary Index) for each determinand at each lag3. Plotting the semivariogram for each determinand, based on lags between points (x-axis) and the semivariance (y-axis) 4. Applying a model to the semivariogram data. Each of these steps is described below. The nearest neighbours between each point on the field sampling grid were determined in both orthogonal and diagonal directions (see Figure 2.2). The next step was to calculate 1, 2 and 3lags for each point on the grid (see Figure 2.3). The Geary Index of autocorrelation was then used to test whether the observed value of a variable at one location was independent of values of that variable at neighbouring locations. Figure 2.2 - Identification of orthogonal and diagonal nearest neighbours Figure 2.3 - Examples of 1, 2 and 3 lags on linear transectsA similarity measure (e.g. Geary Index) is computed for orthogonal and everydiagonal away from each point.Orthogonal direction Diagonal directionNearest neighbour distances Identifying lags Lag 1 Lag 2Lag 3Examples of lags of 1, 2 and 3 onlinear transectsEnvironment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 7The semivariogram expresses mathematically the way in which the variance of a soil property changes as the distance and direction separating any two points varies. Thus, the semivariogramcompares the overall variation in the whole dataset to the joint variation (covariance) for each setof distances (lags) computed in the nearest neighbour analysis. In simple terms, it plots thedissimilarity among values as a function of distance. This technique is described below. The semivariance is calculated as: Thus, the semivariogram is defined as half the expected value (or mean) of the squared difference between pairs of points Y (x) and Y (x+h), separated by distance (lag) h. The most widely used semivariogram model is t he spherical model used below (Figure 2.4) to illustrate the description of the semivariogram. Figure 2.4 - The semivariogram (spherical model) The smallest distance (one orthogonal step) between points in the dataset is termed the minimum range of the variogram. If most of the shaded area lies below this distance, there is insufficient spatial dependency in the dataset to warrant interpolation of data for points whichwere not measured (i.e. an isopleth map of the data cannot be drawn). The maximum range of the variogram is the distance between sampling points beyond which the data values areconsidered to be independent of one another. In Figure 2.4, Ko represents the overall variation of the whole dataset, while Kh represents the joint variation, i.e. the variation-reflected pairs of points at various distances. The nugget variance is the point at which the variogram intersects the y-axis. This represents the 'white noise' pr esent due to error resulting from measurement errors, random errors or spatial variability occurring over shorter distances than the shortest laginterval. The sill of the variogram is the plateau of the plot. Observations over this value arespatially independent. The semivariogram represents the pattern of spatial variation in a soil property and the average rate of change of that property with distance. The steepness of the initial slope of the1 2 (h) = E[{Y( x+h) -Y(x)}2] where: Y (x) = value of the variable, Y, at distance (lag) h Y(x+h) = value of the variable, Y, at distance (lag) x+h E[..] = the expected valueEnvironment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 8semivariogram indicates the intensity of change and the rate of decrease in spatial dependence of that soil property with distance. Semivariogram analysis for the UKSHS intensive sampling study was carried out using Golden Software's Surface Mapping System - Surfer for Windows Version 7.05. Semivariances for selected determinands were plotted as scatter diagrams and visually inspected to locate sills.Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 93 Spatial variability of selected soil properties and contaminants As a precursor to assessing the spatial variabilit y of soil properties, a preliminary inspection was made of the correlation plots between four soil properties and 12 heavy metals, and among these12 heavy metals. The overall matrix of plots is provided in Figure 3.1. It can be seen from this matrix that there are key positive relationships among the determinands, e.g. Ni/Cr, Pb/Cd, V/Cr and Zn/Cd. Figure 3.1 -Overall matrix of plotsKey: Heavy metals indicated by symbols (e.g. As = arsenic) OC = organic carbon OM = organic matter BD = bulk density (no data in this plot) Sn = tin (no data in this plot) The matrix represents the plot of every property and heavy metal against every other property and heavy metal. Each 'square' in thefigure indicates an individual co rrelation plot, based on all data generated in the intensive sampling study. For example, all graphs in the first column from the left represent the correlation of eachelement with pH; graphs in the sixth column from the left, together with the fifth row from the top, represent correlations of properties and elements with Cd.

Because this is a relatively small dataset to use for semivariogram analysis, the results are considered to be exploratory and should beinterpreted with caution. Over the entire sampling grid, the average nearest neighbour distancewas 29.15 m. The minimum nearest neighbour distance was 10 cm and the maximum nearest neighbour distance was 420 m. Omnidirectional semivariograms (using both orthogonal and diagonal lags) were plotted for four soil properties, 12 metals and one example each of a PAH, a PCB and a dioxin. A series ofstandard variograms were produced at lag intervals of 5 m, 10 m, 25 m and 50 m, representing 82, 41, 16 and 8 lags respectively. These are illustrated as four differently coloured plots for each determinand in Figures 3.2-3.4. Many of the points on all semivariograms are based on a very small number of pairs. The small sample numbers combined with the uneven spread of sampling points in the grid means that littleconfidence should be placed on lag distances >200 m. In all variograms, small changes in lag distance produce differently shaped plots. The four different plots for each determinand are thus designed to provide a first impression of theinstability of the data. The scatter of points in all variograms shows a 'dip' in the region of lags150-300 m (see Figures 3.2-3.4). This indicates an under-sampling in this part of the grid. 3.2 Spatial variability of three soil properties The semivariograms for soil pH, soil organic matter and bulk density are shown in Figure 3.2.The semivariograms for organic matter and bulk density show a characteristic 'dip' at lags of150-250 m. This can be seen most clearly in the plot for lags of 50 m. Neither of thesemivariograms for these two soil properties shows the classic form illustrated in Figure 2.4. No attempt has been made to fit models. For bulk density, there is a gradual rising limb in the semivariogram from a 'nugget' variance (background variation or 'white noise') of approximately 0.01 to a high at approximately 0.08. Ifthe 'dip' associated with under-sampling in the grid had not occurred, this level could havemarked the sill position. However, it would be unsafe to make this interpretation on the basis of the present data. For soil organic matter, there is no obvious trend because the 'nugget' variance is high. The same is true for soil pH. For both organic matter and pH, the 'nugget' variance can be seen inplots of all four lags, indicating no spatial dependence in these properties over the scales sampled. Overall, the semivariograms for soil properties show that the chosen UKSHS sampling scheme (see UKSHS Report No. 2) in which three sub-samples were taken within 20 m of each otherwould capture the greater part of any spatial dependence in the data.Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 110 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Lag Distance (m)010002000300040005000600070008000900010000Sem i v ar i an c eOrganic Matter (%) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Lag Distance (m)00.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.08S emivariance Bulk Density (g/cm\u00b3) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Lag Distance (m)050000000000100000000000150000000000200000000000250000000000300000000000S emivariance H ion concentration 82 lags, width = 5 metres 41 lags, width = 10 metres 16 lags, width = 25 metres 8 lags, width = 50 metres Figure 3.2 - Omnidirectional semivariograms for soil organic matter, bulk density and pH (transformed as pH = -log [H+])Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 123.3 Spatial variability of selected inorganic soil contaminants Although 12 semivariograms were plotted, only six are discussed here. The semivariograms for cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) areshown in Figure 3.3. They all show the same overall pattern of a 'dip' at lags of 150-300 m and a general overall instability. Again, no models were applied. Instead, the semivariograms were inspected visually to locate sills. All six elements show a steeply rising limb in the first 10-20 m ofthe variogram. This becomes gentler from 20-50 m, al though there are no clear sills in any of the plots. Similar unstable plots were obtained for the five elements whose semivariograms areshown in Appendix 1. Overall, the semivariograms for inorganic determinands given in both Figure 3.3 and Appendix 1 show that the chosen UKSHS sampling scheme (see UKSHS Report No. 2), in which three sub-samples were taken within 20 m of each other, would capture the greater part of any spatialdependence in the data. 3.4 Spatial variability of sele cted organic soil contaminants Only three semivariograms were plotted for ex amples (benzo(a)pyrene, dioxin WHO-TEQ upper limit and PCB 101) from the organic contaminants dataset. These are shown in Figure 3.4 andare even less stable than those for inorganic determinands. The plots for benzo(a)pyrene and PCB 101 again show the same overall pattern of a 'dip' at lags of 150-300 m. No models were applied. Instead, the semivariograms were inspected visually to locate sills. None of the three plots show the clear pattern expected for a semivariogram. Theseresults indicate that a much larger dataset would be required to detect any spatial trends fororganic determinands. Overall, the semivariograms for organic determinands shown in Figure 3.4 indicate high background (white noise) variability for these determinands, which may not be spatiallydependent. The spatial analysis and semivariograms do not identify whether the UKSHSsampling scheme (see UKSHS Report No. 2), in which three sub-samples were taken within 20m of each other, would capture the greater part of any spatial variability in the organicdeterminand data. A further, more detailed, spatial sampling campaign based on a few organic determinands would be required to determine whether or not there is any clear spatial trend and, if so, what the scale of that pattern is.Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 130 50 1 00 150 200 2 50 300 3 50 400 Lag D istance (m)00. 010. 020. 030. 040. 050. 060. 07Sem i var i ance Cadmium Dry Wt (mg/kg) 0 5 0 10 0 15 0 200 25 0 30 0 35 0 40 0 Lag D istance (m)051015202530354045S emivariance Chromium Dry Wt (mg/kg) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Lag Dista nce (m)0500010 00015 00020 00025 000Se m i i an c e Manganese Dry Wt (mg/kg) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Lag D istance (m)050100150200250300350400450S emivarianceLead Dry Wt (mg/kg) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Lag Dista nce (m)02004006008001 0001 2001 400Sem i v ar i an ce Zi nc Dry Wt (mg /kg ) 82 lags, width = 5 metres 41 lags, width = 10 metres 16 lags, width = 25 metres 8 lags, width = 50 metres0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Lag D istance (m)00 .00050.0010 .00150.0020 .00250.0030 .0035Semivariance Mercury Dry Wt (mg/kg) 0 50 1 00 150 200 2 50 300 3 50 400 Lag D istance (m)00. 010. 020. 030. 040. 050. 060. 07Sem i var i ance Cadmium Dry Wt (mg/kg) 0 5 0 10 0 15 0 200 25 0 30 0 35 0 40 0 Lag D istance (m)051015202530354045S emivariance Chromium Dry Wt (mg/kg) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Lag Dista nce (m)0500010 00015 00020 00025 000Se m i i an c e Manganese Dry Wt (mg/kg) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Lag D istance (m)050100150200250300350400450S emivarianceLead Dry Wt (mg/kg) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Lag Dista nce (m)02004006008001 0001 2001 400Sem i v ar i an ce Zi nc Dry Wt (mg /kg ) 82 lags, width = 5 metres 41 lags, width = 10 metres 16 lags, width = 25 metres 8 lags, width = 50 metres0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Lag D istance (m)00 .00050.0010 .00150.0020 for six selected inorganic determinands.

The method of calculating these statistics isdescribed in UKSHS Report No. 3. To compare the relative 'uncertainties' of contaminant results derived from laboratory analyses and field sampling procedures, the relative standard deviation and the uncertainty were calculated for each determinand in the intensive sampling study. This was carried out for datapoints lying within 20 m of each other, the maximum distance between samples collected from asingle site as part of the main UKSHS sampling programme. In the sampling grid at Tatton Hall,this involved calculating the %RSDs for the 12 points lying within the 10 m x 20 m portion of the grid. Tables 4.5 and 4.6 give the field sampling %RSDs for inorganic and organic determinands respectively. 4.2 Uncertainty of field sampling and laboratory measurement This section assesses and compares the degree of uncertainty attached to: the UKSHS field sampling strategy; the laboratory analysis and measurement of metal and organic determinands. Statistical data for field sampling and laboratory determination of all 13 metals and metalloids are compared, but consideration of the organic determinands (dioxins, PCBs and PAHs) is restrictedto the totals data. 4.2.1 Uncertainty of measurement (UoM) UKSHS Report No. 3 describes the uncertainty of measurement (UoM) calculation used for all metal and organic laboratory determinations carried out in the UKSHS. The UoM is the intervalon the measurement scale within which the true value lies with a specified probability when allrelevant sources of error have been taken into account. For the purposes of this assessment, the UoM for laboratory determinations is given as 2 x RSD as described in UKSHS Report No. 3. A similar calculation was applied to field sampled data in the intensive sampling study using only those data that lay within the first 20 m of the sampling grid; this represents the approximate areawithin which replicate soil samples were taken at each UKSHS site (see UKSHS Report No. 2). The section compares UoM values obtained from soil sampling during the intensive sampling project and those obtained from analysing Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) in thelaboratory.Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 164.2.2 Relative standard deviations (%RSDs) As well as comparing the UoM, the proportion of uncertainty due to (a) laboratory and (b) field data was estimated as described below. The total variance (S TOT2) of the data is related to the field sample variance (S F2) (i.e. the sampling variability) and the laboratory associated variance (S AN2) as follows: STOT2 = S F2 + S AN2 (S = standard deviation) and so S F2 = S TOT2 - S AN2 With unlimited resources, the best approach to take would be to determine the laboratory precision (S AN) at a particular concentration by analysis of replicates of each sample collected. However, this was not possible within the financial constraints of the UKSHS and, as is shownlater, it was reasonable to assume that S AN did not show significant variation for samples with similar concentrations. Therefore, field uncertainty can be calculated as follows: i. Calculate the value of S AN expected at the mean concentration for the samples using the laboratory %RSD for the same determinand. ii. Estimate the value of S F from S TOT and the calculated S AN using the equation above. iii. Calculate the %RSD from S F and the mean value. The data for benzo(a)pyrene1 are used to illustrate this approach: 1) S AN = (150.12 x 13.53)/100 = 20.3 2) So, S F2 = (104.86)2 - (20.3)2 = 10583 3) Therefore, S F = 102.87 and %RSD = (102.87/150.12) x 100 = 68.5 This result (the proportion of the 'total uncertainty' due to field sampling) of 68.5 per cent indicates that virtually all of the uncertainty in the result is associated with the soil heterogeneity; it compares well with the value of 69.9 per cent (the uncertainty calculated using 2 x RSD) from Table 4.6. Note that the estimated S F includes the variability for: the determinand across the sampling region; the sampling, sub-sampling, drying and other sample preparation processes. Finally it is necessary to address the issue of the change in precision with concentration. The assumption is made that, for benzo(a)pyrene, the precision at the field mean concentration (150.12 mg/kg) is twice as bad as at the laboratory mean concentration (351.76 mg/kg) - a very pessimistic assumption. When 27.0 is substituted for 13.5 in the calculation above, the RSDdrops to 64.4 per cent, which is not a big difference from 68.5 per cent. Thus the assumption isfair unless the field and laboratory concentrations are very different. 1 Field mean concentration from Table 4.6 and laboratory %RSD from Table 4.4Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 174.3 Uncertainty associated with inorganic determinands The uncertainty data for field sampling and laboratory analysis of inorganic CRMs are given in Tables 4.1 and 4.5. A direct comparison of field and laboratory UoM and %RSD data is presented in Tables 4.7 and 4.8 respectively. There is little difference in the directly calculated field uncertainty and the estimated proportion of total uncertainty for all metals. The results therefore indicate that the vast majority of theuncertainty is due to relatively small-scale field heterogeneity. 4.4 Uncertainty associated with organic determinands The uncertainty data for field sampling and laboratory analysis of the three types of organicCRMs are given in Tables 4.9-4.11. Since there is little difference in the directly calculated field uncertainty and the estimated proportion of total uncertainty for all metals, the above results indicate that the vast majority of the uncertainty is due to relatively small-scale field heterogeneity. 4.5 Conclusions The study of the spatial variability of determinands (including soil properties, inorganic and organic determinands) measured in the UKSHS has s hown that the soils in this intensive study are spatially variable even at a relatively small scale. For both metals and organics, an estimate of the proportion of total uncertainty due to field spatial variability has indicated that the vast majority of the uncertainty is due to relatively small-scalefield heterogeneity. A study entitled 'Comparative Evaluation of European Methods on Sampling and Sample Preparation of Soils' (CEEM Soil) carried out for the European Commission (Wagner et al. 2000) included 15 institutions from 13 European countries. Participants used their own standardmethods of soil sampling on a single (common) test site of 0.61 ha, which consisted of fourdifferent soil mapping units and three different types of land use. The study concluded that there was insufficient comparability of results. This is illustrated by the fact that the participants came to different conclusions for up to 61% of the 18 soil quality criteriainvestigated. It was concluded that, in general, sampling and sample preparation errors were ofabout the same order of magnitude as the errors in chemical analysis. These conclusions are consistent with findings of this current study. Wagner et al. (2000) emphasised the need to establish quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) measures forsampling, just as there are for analysis. They pointed out that there was no agreement amongthe participants on: how many samples need to be taken; whether single or composite samples should be taken; how many samples there should be in a composite (different methods involved <20).Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 18Table 4.1 - Precision/bias/uncertainty data for laboratory determination of metal CRMs Metal CRM Ref (mg/kg) SD (mg/kg) %RSD %Bias Uncertainty (%) As [6.12] 0.54 9 18 As + 5 spike 0.93 8.5 (-8.7) 17 Cd 14.0 0.37 2.65 -4.8 5.3 Cr 134.8 6.99 5.2 -1.5 10.4 Cu 46.9 1.4 3.0 -15.0 6.0 Hg 0.24 0.0225 9.4 7.7 18.8 3.16 3.35 Pb 51.3 2.66 5.2 -2.5 10.4 [225] 21.65 9.5 19 V [46.3] 1.56 3.35 6.7 V + 10 spike 1.46 2.6 (-9.3) 5.2 Zn 270 7.8 2.9 -14.0 5.8 [ ] Estimate of reference co ncentration (i.e. no certified reference value available) ( ) Bias estimated from spike recovery rather than certified reference value UoM calculation used includes no bias component (i.e. % UoM = 2 x RSD).

Those that exist document heavy metal fallout (e.g. lead or cadmium from stacksor smelting). No similar comprehensive st udies on organic contaminants have been found. 5.1 Spatial variability of inorganic soil contaminants. Raw data from a number of other studies have been used to calculate the 'uncertainty' from intensive sampling campaigns, which can be compared with those encountered in the UKSHS intensive sampling project (Table 5.1). Table 5.1 - Calculation of field sampling 'uncertainties' for other soil sampling studies, using the technique outlined in Section 4 Study No. of samplesStatistic Cd Cu 124.45 - Mean 0.34 - - - - %RSD 17.65 - - - -Wu et al.

All uncertainties are significantly higher than in the UKSHS, with uncertainties in the Swiss study around 2.5 times higher for Pb and Cd. The uncertainties calculated for Cd in the USA (Wu et al. 2002) and Mn/Pb in France (Arrouays et al. 1996) are approximately the same as, or a little higher, than those obtained in the UKSHS. The field sampling uncertainties generated in the UKSHS are thus within the ranges of uncertainties generated elsewhere. 5.2 Spatial variability of organic soil contaminants. Spatial variability of organic contaminants within soils cannot currently be compared with other datasets due to a lack of comparable intensive surveys.Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 266 Conclusions Geostatistical methods to analyse and study the spatial variability of soil properties are widely used in soil classification and mapping and, increasingly, in soil fertility studies. However, thereare relatively few studies of soil inorganic contaminants and none have been found that focus onthe organic contaminants (dioxins, PAHs and PCBs) studied in the UKSHS Project. Geostatistical methods, particularly analysis of the semivariance of soil properties on intensively sampled grids, are now an important first step in determining appropriate soil sampling scales forlarge-scale soil sampling projects. This intensive soil sampling study was introduced into theUKSHS Project to assess appropriate scales for soil sampling at each of the rural and urban sitesin the main study. Overall, the results presented in this report indicate that there was an under-sampling of certain regions in the sampling grid used for the intensive sampling study, particularly between lags 150-300 m. The resulting semivariograms showed 'dips' in these lag regions of the plots. A largerdataset, collected over a more evenly and intensively sampled grid, might generate more stablesemivariograms than those presented in this report. However, the results confirm that the chosen scale of sub-sampling (three sub-samples collected within 20 m of each other) at each point in the main UKSHS Project (see UKSHS Report No. 2)would have captured the greater part of any spatial dependence in soil contaminants for a widerange of inorganic determinands. The apparently large variations in the example UK SHS organic contaminants (as illustrated in the semivariograms presented in Section 3.4) indicate that a much bigger dataset, collected over amore intensive and more closely spaced sampling grid, would be required to detect spatialpatterns in organic contaminants. Statistical analysis of field sampling uncertainties in the UKSHS Project indicates that they lie well within the uncertainties found in similar studies elsewhere. Estimates of the proportion of total uncertainty due to field spatial variability have shown that there is little difference in the directly calculated field uncertainty and the estimated proportion of total uncertainty for all metal and organic determinations. These results indicate that the vast majority of the uncertainty is due to relatively small-scale field heterogeneity.Environment Agency UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant Survey 27References Arrouays D, Mench M, Amans V and Gomez A, 1996 Short-range variability of Pb fallout in a contaminated soil .
