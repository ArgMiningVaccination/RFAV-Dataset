AllopathicMedicineisbasedonthepropagatedfearof death from infectious diseases and a complete lack of nutrition education.History of Allopathic Medicine The term allopathic medicine was coined in the 1800's to differentiate 2 types of medicine. Homeopathy was on one side and was based on the theory that \"like cures like.\" The thought is that very small doses of a substance that cause the symptoms of a diseasecould be used to alleviate that disease. In contrast, allopathic medicine was defined as the practice of using opposites; using treatments that have the opposite effects of the symptoms of a condition. Quinineis a medication used to treat malaria. This includes the treatment of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum. Quinine was first isolated in 1820 from the bark of acinchonatree.Bark extracts have been used to treat malaria since at least 1632. In the 19th century, compounds such as quinine, strychnine, morphine, and ephedrine were isolated and studied. Later (mostly in the twentieth century) many of the compounds were synthesized and some became available.List of Drugs from PlantAlkaloids A number of alkaloids from reduces the secretions of certain organs in the body, such as the stomach and intestines Atropine isamedicationusedtotreatcertaintypesof nerveagentand Belladonna has been used since the times of the Greeks. It was also used in the Middle Ages in Europe to enhance the appearance of women by dilating pupils. Today, these alkaloids are used as antidotes for poisoning, to treat cardiac problems, in antidiarrhoea preparations, and to dilate pupils during eye examinations.Atropa belladonna Solanaceae Rauvolfia Alkaloids A number of plants of this group were used medicinally in India several centuries BC. Rauvolfia serpentina (Apocynaceae)- contains alkaloids that are potent hypotensive agents. One of the main alkaloids, reserpine , is used to treat hypertension and certain types of mental illness. Relatively large doses are used to treat schizophrenic patients.Rauvolfia serpentina (Apocynaceae) Dried roots Catharanthus alkaloids Two complex are used to treat leukemia. Vinblastine andvincristine are antineoplastic, kill various types of cancerous Sadabahar Opium poppy, opium poppy, Papaver somniferum (Papaveraceae), have long been used to alleviate pain. Opium is isolated by lightly slashing the immature fruit capsules. The latex oozes out and hardens after a day or so. Morphine is one of the principal alkaloids of opium. These alkaloids are very addictive, but are potent pain killers (analgesics). Codeine , another morphine alkaloid, is a potent antitussive agent, that is, it inhibits coughing.Poppy flower and capsule Coca and cocaine Coca leaves ( Erythroxylum coca , Erythroxylaceae) have long been used as a stimulant. The Indians chewed the leaves mixed with lime to free the alkaloids. The alkaloids reduced feelings of hunger and pain. Later when the alkaloids were isolated, it was discovered that they had local anesthetic properties. Cocaine has been used for surgery (especially dental surgery).Coca Erythroxylum (Liliaceae), is used to treat gout. The compound is fairly specific for the disease, but is highly toxic and its use must be carefully monitored.Colchicum autumnale (Liliaceae) Quinine is obtained from dried barks and root of Cinchona spp. It is antimalarial, effective against chloroquine resistant mosquito strains . Although there have been extensive searches for new plant-derived antimalarials, few have surfaced. One, artemisinin from Artemisia annua , has proved effective and in southeastAsia.Quinine, Cinchona officinalis , gymnosperm) have been used for thousands of years in China. There it is often called \"ma huang\". Ephedrine and a series of related compounds are used today as decongestants and to treat low blood pressure.Ephedrasp., Ephedraceae Willows and aspirin Extracts of willow bark ( Salixspp., Salicaceae) and leaves alleviated pain. The compound that is responsible is called \"salicin\". This compound, acetylsalicylic acid, could be taken orally and was an effective analgesic, anti-inflamatory, and antipyretic drug and is probably the most widely used drug in the world today.Willow, Salix nigra , Salicaceae Steroids from plants Many types of animal hormones are steroids. Although the steroids from plants are similar, most do not have pronounced hormonal activity in animals and ordinarily must be chemically modified before use. The commonly used plant for steroids is Dioscorea spp. (Dioscoreaceae). The plants have large tuberous roots.These steroids occur as complex glycosides (that is, they have sugars attached) that give them soap-like properties and are sometimes called saponins. These compounds are relatively common in plants. Starting material for cortisones, sex hormone; used in anti inflammatory and anti fertility medicines.Male and female Dioscorea plants Cardiac glycosides The use of plants to treat heart disease goes back thousands of years and is found in several cultures. One of the plants found in the folk medicine of Europe is Digitalis purpurea (Scrophulariaceae). Digitalis is widely used in treatment of dropsy, a condition associated with congestive heart failure. The active principle is glycoside Digoxin.Digitalis, Digitalis purpurea from several Taxusspecies, was first discovered in the 1960's, but the alkaloid didn't become widely used until the mid 1980's. Taxol is useful for treating several types of tumors, but was originally developed for ovarian tumors. The alkaloid occurs in highest concentration in , a gymnospermous tree from China, improve capillary blood flow and improve memory and some aspects of function.Ginkgo, Ginkgo biloba , Ginkgoaceae Ginseng, Panaxginseng , Araliaceae Ginseng has long been used as a way of maintaining health and for treating and curing many types of human ailments. The active compounds are hyoscyamine Used as sedative, antispasmodic, to relieve pain and Glycyrrhiza laxative, expectorant in bronchitis, asthma, hoarseness of Sarpgandha Rauvolfiaserpentina Family Apocynaceae About 30 alkaloids reported, reserpine roots also have oleoresin , sterol, unsaturated alcohol.
