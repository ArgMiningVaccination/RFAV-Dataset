6FOREWO RD The LA County Rabies Control & Animal Disease Reporting Manual is a resource guide for veterinarians and clinic staff to help prevent and control rabies and other animal diseases in Los Angeles County (LA County). It conta ins essential information such as LA County-s pecific r ules and regulations on animal bite and disease reporting, local data, state resources, and forms and instructions for reporting and animal testing. LA County is home to more than 25% of California's population. Our c ounty has more than 500 veterinary p ractices all in an area covering over 4000 square miles. There are 34 animal control agencies and 20 animal shelters. It is the only jurisdiction in the state that requires report ing of many diseases in companion and wild animals. This places our animal healt h community on the cutting edge in detecting disease trends, geographic illne ss clusters, outbreaks, and emerging diseases. If your practice is within LA County , this manu al is an important resource for your team to use in fulfilling bite and disease reporting responsibilities. Pleas e review the contents of the manual during a staff meeting and share a link to the manu al with your staff: L ong Beach, Pasadena and Vernon exceptions: Thes e three cities have their own health departments; therefore they do NOT fall within the jurisdiction of our department. If your practice is in one of t hese three cit ies, you must report animal bites to the Pasadena Humane Society (626 -792-7151), Long Beach Animal Care Services (562 -570-7387) , or (in Vernon) the Southeast Area Animal Control Authority (562 -803-3301). Veterinary practices are legally requi red to report animal diseases to the public health jurisdiction where the animal resides, in the case of these three cities, to their respective animal control agencies listed above. You play a vital role in helping to protect the public's health every day, whether you are diagnosing and treat ing disease in animals, educating the public, or promoting pet wellness. This manual will tell you what you need to know about services the Veter inary Public Health Program of LA County offer s, important local public health issues, and what is legally reportable locally. Thank you for your continued partnership. 7Rabies Control and Bite Reporting Procedures BACKGROUND: All mammals are susceptible to rabies, but only a limited number of species act as reservoir hosts. In the United States the major terrestrial reservoirs are raccoons, skunks , and foxes . Insectivorous bats also serve as reservoirs for the disease. Each rabies variant is maintained in a particular host, and usually dies out during serial passage to species in which it is not adapted. However, any variant can cause rabies in other species. Occasionally, a virus adapted to one species becomes established in another. The United States is considered canine rabies free, and wildlife is the most important potential source of rabies for both humans and domestic animals. In Southern California, bats are the main source of rabies. Skunk variants of rabies are currently found in Santa Barbara County and Northern California. Bats, skunks, foxes, raccoons, coyotes, and even opossums are all considered potential sources of rabies, based on California and national rabies data. In addition, each year many dogs are imported into the US from countries where the canine variant of rabies still exists. Reducing the risk of rabies in domestic animals and preventing contact with wildlife reservoirs is key to the prevention of human rabies. California law requires that all owned dogs be vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian using approved vaccines (CA Health & Safety Code \u00a7 121690 , California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Sections 2606.4 and 2606.6). RABIES VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS FOR DOMESTIC ANIMALS The State of California mandates rabies vaccination for dogs, but not for cats. However, some localities require rabies vaccination and/or licensing of cats. A listing of local requirements for licensing and/or rabies vaccination of cats is included in this manual. In California, the mi nimum age dogs may receive their first rabies vaccination is three months of age. Initial licensing of dogs in California remains at four months of age. In cases where rabies vaccination may endanger a dog's life, a licensed veterinarian can submit a rabie s vaccination exemption request using the approved forms to the local health officer. REPO RTING BITES AND RABIES SUSPECT ANIMALS In California, anyone with knowledge of an animal bite to a person must report the incident to the local health department, including veterinarians and their staff. The following must be r eport ed to VPH immediately: 1.Mammals, domestic or wild, that bite a human Bites from rabbits, squirrels, rats, mice, gophers, and other rodents are NOT reportable. 2.Domestic mammals (pets or livestock) that have an encounter with wildlife 83.Neurologic animals (wild or domestic) suspected of being rabid B ite reporting forms are found on the VPH website and are i ncluded in this manual. Email c ompleted forms to vet@ph.lacounty.gov . QUARANTINE OF BITING ANIMALS (GENERAL) Once the bite report is received and process ed by VPH, the animal is placed under quarantine. For owned animals, q uarantines are usually overseen by VPH at the animal's home . Quarantines may be completed at shelters or veterinary clinics (cost s may be incurred at owner's expense). Please note that location transfers of quarantined animals (i.e. moving between two separate homes) are not allowed except in rare circumstances and with prior approval from VPH. It is always allowable to move a quarantined animal from a home to a shelter or to a veterinary clinic as needed for care and services. 1.QU ARANTINE - MAMMALS BITING PEOPLE Any DOMESTIC animal that bit a person must be quarantined and observed for clinical signs of rabies by VP H staff. This is true regardless of the rabies vaccination status of the biting animal. The animal is under quarantine until VPH staff issues a Quarant ine Release Notice. Domestic animals that are not subject to a rabies quarantine include: rabbits, rodents, birds and reptiles. Q uar antine Length - For specific quarantine periods, please see the summary flowchar t in this manual. Captive exotic mammals that have bitten a human are quarantined at their facility for at least 30 days . Rabies Vaccination & Booster - For animal bit es to human s, DO NOT vaccinate the animal for rabies during the quarantine period. Euthanasia During Quarantine - Domestic biting animals are not to be euthanized until after the quarantine period without prior permission from VPH staff . EXCEPTION - I f the domestic animal is gravely ill or injured, it may be euthanized during the quarantine period for humane reasons without prior permission. oIn such cases, the head of the animal must be su bmitted appropriately for rabies testing. 2.QU ARAN TINE - DOMESTIC MAMMALS BIT TEN BY WILDLIFE Whenever possible, the wild animal should be humanely euthanized, prepared and submitted to VPH for rabies testing . If the wild mammal tests negative for rabies, no quarantine of the domestic animal is required. If the wild mammal is not tested or tests positive for rabies, the domestic animal must be quarantined. 9Quarantine Length - Dependent on the domestic animal's rabies vaccin ation status at the time of the bite. For specific quarantine periods, please see summary flowchart . Rabies Vaccination & Booster - Rabies vaccination and booster recommendations are dependent upon current vaccination status. If a domestic mammal is bit by wildlife and is current on rabies vaccination at the time of the bite, VPH recommends a booster immediately, even if the rabies vaccine is not due. If a domestic mammal is bit by wildlife and is NOT current on rabies vaccination at the time of the bite, VPH recommends vaccinating immediately post -bite (or when medically stable) . If a domestic mammal is bit by wildlife and has NEVER had a rabies vaccination, VPH recommends the Texas protocol : 1.vaccinate immediately after bite 2.again at week 3 , and 3.again at week 8 post- bite Euthanasia During Quarantine - Domestic animals that are under quarantine due to wildlife exposure should not be euthanized until after the quarantine period without prior permission from VPH staff. EXCEPTION - If the domestic animal is gravely ill or injured, it may be euthanized during the quarantine period for humane reasons without prior permission. oIn such cases, the head of the animal must be su bmitted appropriately for rabies testing if euthanized more than 2 weeks after the attack . 3.N EURO LOGIC ANIMAL SUSPECTED OF BEING RABID For any animal sus pected of being rabid (wild or domestic) , isolate the animal and contact VPH immediately at 213 -288-7060. Complete and submit a bite report using a Bite Report Form, even if no bite occurred. Write 'None' in the Person Bitten Field. Neurologic animals suspected of being rabid are placed under strict isolation by VPH. If the a nimal die s or is euthanized, the animal must be prepared, submitted to VPH , and tested for rabies. If requesting rabies testing, complete the appropriate sections of the Bite Report Form, even if no one was bitten. RA BIES TESTING IN ANIMALS In LA County , rabies testing is conducted by the Public Health Laboratory at the LA County Department of Public Health. Please complete the appropriate rabies submission form and call VPH to arrange a specimen pickup for rabies testing. Specimen preparation, including decapitation, must be performed by the facility submitting the sample. Only rabies -vaccinated staff should perform decapitations. See rabies specimen preparation instructions in this manua l for more information. 10Exception: Bats are NOT to be decapitated. Whenever possible, any WILD mammal that has bitten a human shall be humanely euthanized, prepared , and submitted for rabies testing. RA BIES TESTING IN BATS Any bat that may have potentially expos ed humans or animals must be reported and tested (e.g. found on a sidewalk, in a public area, outside /inside of a home or business) . If a bat is found inside the home, and possibly exposed a child or sleeping person it must be reported and tested for rabies, even if a bite is not visualized. Bites from bats can be very small, painless , and go unnoticed. If clients call to report a bat or bring in a bat to your clinic - please collect their name and contact information because VPH will need to speak with them. Then provide them with the following information: oIf you see a dead, sick , or injured bat , OR there is a bat that may have bitten a person or animal, do not touch it or release it. Call your local animal control agency for assistance . oVPH has developed a flyer on bat encounters that you can post or provide to clients - it is included in this manual and is available on our website. RA BIES AND ANIMAL IMPORTATION Dogs and other animals are imported into LA County through the international pet trade and rescue groups daily. The risk of importing rabies and foreign animal diseases to LA County is real and has occurred. Dogs imported from a country where rabies is present must be vaccinated against rabies at least 30 days before entering the USA. Dogs should be vaccinated as early as 3 months of age and wait 1 additional month in the country of origin prior to entry into the USA. Obtain importation and travel information in pet's history. Pets imported into the US, should undergo a veterinary exam and a 30 -day observation period to monitor their health for disease. Please visit the CDC website for a list of high -risk countries for canine rabies: https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing -an-animal- into-the-united -states/high -risk.html At time of publication of this manual CDC has issued a temporary suspension for dogs enteringthe United States from high- risk countries for dog rabies : https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing -an-animal- i nto-the-united -states/high -risk-dog- ban-frn.html oCDC has the authority to issue a CDC Dog Import Permit for US citizens and lawful residents relocating from high -risk cou ntries to bring their dogs into the United States 11Booster the rabies vaccine with a US Licensed Rabies Vaccine approved for use in California. Even if an imported dog has proof of a rabies vaccine, the rabies vaccine must be licensed foruse in the United States and approved for use in California. For a list of approved rabies vaccines, please see the California Department of Public Health's Rabies Compendium : https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/PartIIITableCA CompendiumofRabiesControl.pdf. If any imported dog or other animal is sick, consider foreign animal diseases, including rabies. If you suspect rabies or any other infectious disease, report to VPH immediately.

A County of Los Angeles ordinance exists requiring rabies vaccination and licensing of cats. Certain cities uphold this ordinance, requiring cats to be vac cinated for rabies and /or licensed (based on owner address, not address of the veterinary clinic). Information regarding licensing in certain cities can be obtained by calling local shelters or animal control services divisions. A summary of requirements for licensing and rabies vaccination by city is listed below. Information is based on review of city municipal codes in 2018. City laws are subject to change. Cat owners are encouraged to contact their city for the latest regulations.

Exemptions are only valid for one year. Applications will be automatically denied if missing any of the following: the local and state forms and relevant medical records (5 page maximum). In LA County (except in Pasadena, Long Beach and Vernon) , the authority to grant r abies vaccination exemptions for dogs is delegated to VPH. California law states that a rabies vaccination exemption may be granted if \"a rabies vaccination would endanger the dog's life.\" It also requires that the condition warranting the exemption be documented. This state law applies for dogs only. Local jurisdictions may enact similar requirements for licensing of cats. Contact your local animal control for cat -related rabies vaccine or licensing concerns. The entire law is available at: https://leginfo .legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes.xhtml ( Health and Safety Code 121690 ) . Canine rabies vaccination exemption requests must be submitted to VPH by the veterinarian, not the dog owner. A complete exemption request includes BOTH forms, dog owner's signature, veterinarian's signature AND up to 5 pages of medical records documenting the dog's medical condition related to the request. Incomplete exemption requests will be denied. Only health conditions that fit the evidence -based criteria for exemption may be approved . Dogs approved for a rabies vaccine exemption are considered unvaccinated and must abide by rabies laws for unvaccinated pets . Exemptions are only valid for 1 -year a nd an application must be submitted each year for renewal. Permanent exemptions do not exist. California does not accept positive rabies titers in lieu of a rabies vaccine. STEPS TO SUBMIT A CAN INE RABIES VACCINATION EXEMPTION REQUEST 1. For dogs living in LA County (except Pasadena, Long Beach, or Vernon), canine rabies vaccination exemption requests are submitted by a veterinarian (not the dog owner) to VPH. a.

WHAT TO DO AFTER AN EXEMPTION REQUEST IS APPROVED OR DENIED It is the applying veterinarian's responsibility to relay the approved or denied notice to the pet owner once the notice is received. 1. Provide copies of the final document (Approved or Denied) to your client. 2. Inform your clients that, if their exemption request is approved, their dog: a. Will be considered at higher risk for contracting rabies and will be considered legally unvaccinated. This means the animal will be subject to a California state -mandated 180 - day quarantine if exposed to a wild animal. b. Must be confined at home, or on a 6 -foot-long leash controlled by an adult. c. Cannot live or have contact with other animals not vaccinated for rabies. Only one dog in a household can have a rabies vaccination exemption. 3. The exemption is valid for one year only, after which the dog must either be vaccinated for rabies, or another f ull request must be submitted and approved. 4.

RABIES, LOS ANGELES COUNTY KEY MESSAGES Keep all pets, including indoor cats, up to date with their rabies vaccination Bats are the number one source of rabies in Southern California Do NOT touch any bat with bare hands - call your local animal control agency immediately to report a bat and have it collected for rabies testing BACKGROUND Rabies in bats is prevalent throughout the United States. In recent years, many other wildlife species in California have tested positive for rabies and are considered potential sources of the virus. In 2014, a skunk tested positive for rabies in the city of Long Beach - the skunk was found to have been infected with a Mexican free -tailed bat variant of rabies. All bats reported to and collected by VPH are submitted for rabies testing. We are most concerned about bats acting abnormally (e.g. out during the daytime, weak, found unmoving on the ground or clinging to walls, unable to fly, etc.) ,bats found near people or pets , and bats found inside of homes or businesses . LOCAL DATA The number of rabid bats detected is increasing (Figure 1). Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, an average of 9 -10 bats tested positive for rabies per year in LA County. Since 2010, that number has risen to 34 per year. The year 2021 was a record year for rabid bats in LA County : there were 68 laboratory confir med rabid bats in LA County and 323 bats tested in LA County by the Public Health Laboratory (21% positive). The cause of the increase is unknown. One hypothesis is that climate change and more extreme weather patterns are causing bats to move closer to areas irrigated by people to find insects to eat. RABID BATS BY YEAR, LA COUNTY, 1961 - 2021 Figure 1: Laboratory confirmed rabid bats in LA County from 1961 - 2021 29 Rabid bats can be found in densely populated areas. Most rabid bats are found in suburban areas, and occasionally in highly urban areas (Figure 2). In 20 21, more than a third of the 68 rabid bats found in LA County were found in the city of Santa Clarita. It is unknown if there is a higher incidence of rabid bats in this area, or if the residents are more likely to report bats for rabies testing. REPORTED CASES OF BAT RABIES BY LOCATION FOUND, LA COUNTY , 2021 Figure 2:Map of location bat was found for reported cases of bat rabies in LA County during 2021. Map zoomed to show the Santa Clarita area where most rabid bats were found. Most rabid bats are found at private homes, and some are found indoors. In 20 21, 82% of rabid bats were found at private homes, usually in the yard or side of the house. Even pets that do not go outside can be exposed to rabies. Three rabid bats were found on sidewalks, four inside homes and three inside businesses. Imported pets can bring rabies into LA County. In 2004, a rabid dog was imported through LAX from Thailand, and in 1987 a rabid cat was brought here from Mexico. Hundreds of dogs are imported into our county every year, with many being from countries where the canine rabies variant is still found . If a bat is found near children, pets, or sleeping people, an unrecognized bite may have occurred because bats have tiny teeth, and the bat should be tested for rabies . Any time a bat is found indoors, 30and it is unknown how long it was indoors, it should be tested for rabies if any sleeping or otherwise vulnerable people are in the building. RECOMMENDATIONS Vaccinate pets, including indoor cats. Indoor cats can easily be attracted to a bat in a home and be exposed to rabies . Every year, at least one confirmed rabid bat is found inside a home in LA County. Educate your clients. If they find a bat in their home, they should NOT touch it with bare hands or release it . They should cover it with a bucket or box if possible and call animal control to collect it for rabies testing. If a bat is found in a room where someone was sleeping or near a pet, there is no way to know if that person or pet was bitten. oTo read more about what to do if a bat is found in the home, visit: publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/batinhouse.htm oFor a printable flyer (available in English and Spanish) on what to do if you find a bat, visit: E nglish: http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/images/RabiesOutreach/WhatToDo IfYouFindABatColorPrint.pdf Spanish: http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/images/RabiesOutreach/WhatToD oIfYouFindABatColorPrintSpanish.pdf Make sure to ask your clients if their pet was recently imported. While rabies is not likely to be found in local dogs, the risk of rabies may be higher in imported dogs. Be suspicious of rabies if you are seeing a sick dog coming from other countries, especially from places where caninerabies is common. oFor an updated list of rabies risk worldwide, please visit the CDC website listing importcountries additional information on Rabies in LA County, please visit : http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/rabies.htm 31ANIMAL DISEASE REPORTING AND SURVEILLANCE, LOS ANGELES COUNTY LA County is unique in that many diseases in companion animals and wildlife are legally reportable locally to VPH . These local reporting ordinances stem from the 1920s after a devastating Foot -And- Mouth Disease outbreak. According to the Code of Ordinances (Title 10, Division 2, Section 10.64.020), any infectious disease in animals must be reported to the local health department. For more information on the LA County Ordinances related to infectious disease reporting in animals, visit m unicode.com/library . Click on the state of California, then LA County, then click on Title 10. Search for 10.56.010, 10.64.010, 10.64.020, 10.64.030, 10.72.010, 10.72.020, 10.72.030, and REPORTING Disease reports are received by VPH in one of two ways: 1) direct reporting forms from veterinary clinics and 2) veterinary diagnostic laboratories report to VPH on select animal diseases. For the cases which are reported from the diagnostic laboratories , VPH will follow -up with the respective clinic if a reporting form has not already been completed. A reportable animal disease list is updated and published biennially by VPH Animal disease reporting forms are located on our website and inc luded in the reporting manual. Always inc lude any relevant medical records and copies of laboratory results/diagnostics. Completed disease reporting forms can be submitted by email vet@ph.lacounty.gov , fax (213) 481- 2375 or by phone (213) 288- 7060 - ask to speak to our Veterinarian -On-Call, Monday through Friday, 8am- 5pm. EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ANIMAL DISEASE REPORTING Veterinary staff are crucial partners in the effort to track the epidemiology of local diseases. Reporting by veterinary practices and shelters has helped document patterns and changes associated with familiar diseases, such as the increase in rabies in bats and the bi -modal seasonality of parvovirus in dogs. Reporting by veterinarians has also uncovered new and potentially emerging diseases and imported diseases, such as canine influenza H3N2 in dogs imported from China in 2021, leptospirosis outbreak in d ogs in 2021 and distemper outbreak in wildlife in 2021. By monitoring and investigating animal disease in the county, VPH work s together with local veterinarians and other agencies to address these challenges and to protect the community. The future will bring additional infectious disease challenges. Antimicrobial resistance confronts clinicians in the exam room and will likely be the focus of increasing amounts of legislation affecting animal care. Pesticide resistance complicates efforts to control disease vectors such as fleas. New, 32invasive Aedes mosquitoes in LA County are drought- resistant and capable of spreading heartworm and other diseases . CASE DEFINITIONS To categorize cases of disease consistently our program has developed case definitions. A case definition is a set of criteria used to evaluate reported cases of a disease and determine how they should be counted. A case definition categorizes cases as \"confirmed\", \"probable\" or \"suspected\". Laboratory test verification is required for a case to be considered confirmed. VPH is currently the only public health program in the United States consistently tracking numerous infectious diseases in companion animals. Case definitions are available on VPH's website, at: http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/surveillance.htm STATE REPORTABLE DISEASES When VPH receives a disease report for a disease that is also reportable to the State of California, VPH will then report that and forward the form to California Department of Public Health (CDPH) or the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Ther e are six diseases in animals that are reportable to CDPH : anthrax, plague, tularemia, viral hemorrhagic fevers (e.g. Ebola virus), and Brucella spec ies (excluding Brucella canis ), and rabies. Many diseases of livestock are re portable to CDFA . ANIMAL DISEASE INVESTIGATIONS In cases of a cluster/outbreak (3 or more animals) or when a significant emerging pathogen is suspected necropsies and diagnostic tests may be available at no cost through VPH. Specimens are tested at the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory (CAHFS) in San Bernardino. Courier transportation is provided through VPH. Please reach out to the Veterinarian -on-Call at 213 -288-7060 (Monday through Friday, excluding holidays , 8am - 5pm) or email vet@ph.lacounty.gov to consult on the case. Specific dates, locations, and symptoms of each animal in the outbreak must be provided and an appropriate reporting form must be completed. Carcasses must be fresh and refrigerated, not frozen. 33 ANIMAL HEALTH BRANCH L IST OF REPORTABLE CONDITIONS FOR ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS * *Pursuant to Section 9101 of the California Food and Agricultural Code, Title 3 California Code of Regulations \u00a7 797 and Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations Section 161.4(f) 1 Diseases in blue, seen in any species , are also reportable to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) F or additiona l information, contact CDFA ( email: evet@cdfa.ca.gov or visit our website at www.cdfa.ca.gov/ah) or USDA at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health EMERGENCY CONDITIONS Report within 24 Hours of Discovery REGULATORY CONDITIONS Report within Two Days of Discovery MONITORED CONDITIONS Report within 30 Days of Discovery MULTIPLE SPECIES General, non-specific conditions: Unexplained high mortality or diseased animals; livestock exposed to toxic substances.

The risk of importing foreign animal diseases to LA County is real and has occurred. Per LA County, Code of Ordinances (Title 10, Division 2, Section 10.56.10), no sick or injured animal can be imported into LA County . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulate animal importation. Although regulations prohibit the importation of underage and sick dogs, these issues continue to occur. Some dogs imported into LA County are sick and/or come with fraudulent paperwork. Puppy importers often advertise their dogs as being domestically bred. Be sure to inquire about the origin of any new puppy. Dogs imported from a country where rabies is present should be healthy, vaccinated against rabies as early as 3 months of age, and wait one additional month after rabies vaccination priorto arrival into the USA. For more information on importing please visit:https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing -an-animal- into-the-united -states/dogs.html Per the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Welfa re Act (\u00a72148, Importation of live dogs), dogs imported into the USA for retail, research, or veterinarytreatment purposes must be at least 6 months of age, in good health and be up to date on theirvaccines. If an imported dog is intended for resale, an importer must receive an import permit from the USDA prior to shipment. For more information: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet- travel/bring -pet-into-the-unite d-states Per California Department of Public Health (CDPH), dogs and cats entering California must meetthe following criteria oCalifornia Entrance Requirements for Dogs: \"A ll domestic dogs must be healthy. Dogs over four (4) months of age must have a certi ficate of current rabies vaccination. A Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI), also known as a health certificate, is not required for privately owned dogs being brought into the State of California. Persons bringing dogs into California with intent to sell or transfer ownership must have a healthcertificate completed by a licensed veterinarian within the 10 days prior to the date of importation. The person seeking to bring a dog into the state must send a copy of the health certificate to the county health department in the county in which the dog is to be sold or in the county of residence of the person who is receiving the dog. All personstransporting dogs via commercial air should call the airline for any additionalrequirements they might have.\" oCalifornia Entrance Requirements for Cats: \"All domestic cats must be healthy. Neither a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI), also known as a health certificate, nor a rabies 50 vaccination is required to import a cat into California; however, if traveling into California via airplane, please call the airline as they may have additional requirements.\" For more information, visit CDPH website: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/PetDogandCatImportationandExp ortation.aspx Southern California has several active international dog res cue groups that import dogs internationally through LAX. Dogs that are rescued tend to be stray or street dogs, which have an increased likelihood of exposure to infectious diseases. Imported cases of rabies, canine influenza H3N2, leishmaniasis, heartworm, distemper, and parvovirus have been documented. If you work with a rescue organization, strongly encourage veterinary exams and a 30 -day observation period for each animal. If any imported animal is sick, consider foreign animal diseases, including rabie s, and report to VPH immediately at 213- 288-7060. RECOMMENDATIONS Reinforce proper hygiene habits and biosecurity to owners (e.g., wash hands after handling the dog, wear gloves to pick up and clean pet waste, and do not bring the dog around other animal s until the dog is confirmed to be healthy and fully vaccinated). Pets imported into the US, should undergo a veterinary exam and a 30 -day observation period to monitor their health for disease. For a list of high -risk countries for canine rabies, please v isit the CDC website: https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing -an-animal- into-the-united -states/high -risk.html Consider boostering vaccines. For a rabies vaccine to be considered valid in LA County, a US licensed rabies vaccine for use in California must be used. A list of approved vaccines is provided in the California Rabies Compendium . PET EXPORTATION Interstate Pet Travel Accredited and licensed California veterinarians must complete the United States Interstate and International Certificate of Health Examination for Small Animals (APHIS Form 7001 - aphis.usda.gov/library/forms/pdf/APHIS7001.pdf ) prior to the interstate exportation of dogs and cats. Please check with each state regarding specific exportation requirements. For a list of re quirements for each state, please see the APHIS website at: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet- travel/interstate -pet-travel 51 International Pet Exportation If you are helping an owner export a pet to another country, their paperwork may need to be signed off by the local USDA office at: 222 Kansas St, El Segundo, CA 90245. Phone - 310-725-1970. Services at the USDA office are by appointment only.

From July 2021 -January 2022, L A County saw its largest outbreak of CIV, with over 1300 cases reported throughout the county. Most were associated with congregate settings includingboarding facilities, dog daycares, and shelters. VPH recommends vaccinating dogs in LA COUNTY with the bivalent CIV vaccine and recommending annual boosters. Dogs should be fully vaccinated before entering congregate facilities . BACKGROUND Canine influenza is cause d by the canine influenza virus (CIV). This virus is highly contagious and easily spreads from dog to dog in many differen t settings. There are two know n strains of CIV in the US: H3N2 and H3N8. A bivalent vaccine is available that protects against both strains. Transmission can occu r from direct contact of nasal secretions (coughing, barking, sneezing) or indirect contact through shared toys, water bowls, bedding, or cont aminate d clothing. Infect ed dogs can release or she d the virus two days prior to becoming sympt omatic and are contagious to other dogs for up to 28 days after becoming ill. Confirmed CIV cases should be isolated for 28 days from the first day of illness. Dogs exposed to confirme d or suspect cases should be quarantined for 14 days to monitor for signs of illness. Dogs of any age c an be infecte d althoug h puppies and unvaccinate d dogs have the greatest risk. To date, there is no evidence that humans can become infecte d with CIV. Los Angeles County is a high- risk area for canine influenza virus (CIV), due to the large canine population and significant introduction of dogs from other states and countries wher e the virus may be circulating. Boa rding facilities, dog daycare establishments, and shelters represent the great est risk for exposure and contribute to rapid spread of the disease. There have been sporadic reports of CIV H3N8 and H3N2 in LA County since 2005, including disease clusters related to imported anima ls entering congregate facilities, and some single cases. LOCAL DATA CIV OUTBREA K 2021 - irmed, probable, cases of CIV H3N 2 reported to VPH (Figure s 1, 2). This is the largest outbreak of CIV H3N2 reported in LA County. Sadly, 2.0% (21/1, 058) cases resulted in deaths at the time of reporting. In dogs that were reported with a known exposure, 84.6% (973/1150) reported attending boarding facilities, dog daycare settings, or exposure at a shelter. 53CIV sprea d rapidly throughout LA County, affecting at least 68 canine congregate facilities and two shelters. All known affected facilities were contacted by VPH and provided recommendations to preven t further spread of CIV. 15.4% (177/1150) of cases with know n exposure did not visit a congregate facility but were exposed during walks in their local neighborhood, dog parks, groomers, and veterinary clinics. CIV vaccination status was largely unknown for this population. Vaccination status was known for 28.6% (384/1344) of cases. Where vaccination status was known, 21.4% (82/384) of dogs were fully or partially vaccinated against CIV prior to disease onset (45.1% (37/82) fully vaccinated and 52.4% (43/82) partially vaccinated). Cases where the dog was vaccinated may have been more likely to report vaccination, so this could reflect a bias that is not indicative of actual vaccination levels, which are likely lower.

Although Coccidioides immitis does not spread directly between people or between animals, animals with Valley fever may act as sentinels for human disease in areas of LA County where the fungus is present in the environment. BACKGROUND Valley fever is the common name for the disease coccidioidomycosis, which is caused by fungi (Coccidioides immit is and C. posadasii ) that are endemic in the southwestern United States, but that have also been found in south- central Washington. It is endemic in parts of Mexico, as well as Central and South America. While C. immitis is the species found in Northern California, Southern California is an area of overlap for both species . The fungi live in soil and dust and their spores can spread through the air when contaminated ground is disturbed by the weather, animals, natural disasters, or through human activity, such as farming, construction, and outdoor recreational activities. People and animals are at risk of developing Valley fever when these spores are inhaled. As a result, exposure is environmental in nature and, with extrem ely rare exceptions, the disease does not spread between animals and/or people. Many people and animals that are exposed to Coccidioides do not develop Valley fever. Clinical signs of Valley fever are similar in humans and animals and include fever, fatigu e, cough, and skin lesions. Dogs are the animal most commonly diagnosed with Valley fever and typically have cough, weight loss, inappetence and lethargy. Coccidioid es can disseminate to nearly any organ or tissue, caus ing subcutaneous masses or ulcerations, cardiovascular and ocular disease. Dogs may also have neurologic manifestations such as seizures. In dogs, Coccidioides typically disseminates to the bones resulting in ataxia or paresis, joint effusion, as well as osteomyelitis that can appear similar to cancer. In cats, inappetence and weight loss may be seen, and the most common site of dissemination are cutaneous lesions. Due to specific behaviors, like living outdoors or digging, some pets are at an increased risk of being exposed to Valley fever as compared to people. As a result, pets who develop Valley fever can serve as sentinels for human disease in areas of LA County where Coccidioides is found. 56LOCAL DATA In LA County , cases of Valley fever in animals are reportable to VPH by local veterinarians. Starting in 2014, VPH receives electronic laboratory reports (ELR) from veterinary diagnostic laboratories for every positive antibody test result for Valley fever. This has significantly increased the number of reports, as well as the completeness of the data received. Each reported case of coccidioidomycosis in animals is investigated by a VPH veterinarian to obtain a full case report. Healthy dogs that were simply being tes ted for the disease were not counted as cases. Diagnosis was accomplished by detection of antibodies against the disease (serology) and/or biopsy of lesions or affected tissues, plus recognition of specific clinical signs. Location of probable exposure was assessed by obtaining a travel history. Exposure location was recorded as LA County, southern California other than LA County (Imperial, Kern, Orange, Riverside, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo and Ventura Counties) or outside of southern California. Whenever possible, travel destinations for those cases outside of LA County were recorded. In addition, each report was categorized as confirmed, probable or suspected based on the case definition for Valley fever in animals in LA County. The data collected do not include reports from veterinary practices in the cities of Long Beach or Pasadena ( they have their own public health departments) and animals living in these cities are also generally excluded. Additionally, due to the nature of Valley fever, case follow -up reports are provided to VPH as additional diagnostics are performed. Cases are counted as a new case only once at the time of diagnosis, but VPH continue s to track these cases and update diagnostics and treatment on historical laboratory confirmed cases. COCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS CASES REPORTED IN LA COUNTY, 2012 -2021 Fig ure 1. Confirmed, probable, and suspect coccidioidomycosis cases reported in LA County during 2012 -2021. 57 In the decade between 2012 and 2021, there were 183 cases of Valley fever reported in animals in LA County (Figure 1) , with 180 in dogs and 3 in cats. The median number of cases was 16 per year. Based on the case definition for Valley fever, 66% of cases were classified as confirmed cases, 25% were probable cases and 14% were suspected cases. In 2020, there was a drop in commercial diagnostic laboratory reporting on positive cases during the pandemic. In addition, the pandemic may have had an impact on veterinary visits and testing being performed. From 2017 -2021 there were 114 Valley fever cases reported, 112 in dogs and 2 in cats. Risk factor information was known for 80 of these cases. Among these 80 cases, digging was the most commonly reported risk factor with 20 /80 (25.0%) of animals reported to frequently dig holes. Living mostly outdoors 6/80 (7.5%), living within a site of earth excavation 6/80 (7.5 %), living near a dirt road 5/80 (6.3%), and recently being in a dust storm 4/80 (5.0%) were less commonly reported. Clinical signs information was available for 107 of the 115 cases. Among the 105 cases in dogs with known clinical signs, cough and fever were the most commonly reported symptoms with 5 2/107 (49.5%) dogs reporting fever, and 53 /107 (50.5%) cough. Lameness 42/107 (40.0%) and pneumonia 41/107 (39.0%) were also commonly seen, followed by weight loss 30/107 (28.6%) and enlarged lymph nodes 25/107 (23.8%). Bone and eye lesions were less commonly reported, with 16/107 (15.2%) reported bone lesions and 9 /107 (8.6%) reported eye lesions. Clinical signs information was available for both cat cases, and both cats 2/2 (100%) were reported to have weight loss and no other symptoms. DOMESTIC A NIMAL COCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS CASES IN LA COUNTY, 2012 -2021 Figure 2: Map of coccidioidomycosis cases in domestic animals in Los Angeles County (n=183). 58 Geographic pattern In LA County, Valley fever is known to be endemic in the Antelope Valley and western San Fernando Valley. Most of the locally acquired animal cases were reported from the San Fernando Valley, however, other areas of the county also have a low number of cas es reported. Confirmed cases were concentrated throughout the western and central parts of LA County (Figure 2) . RECOMMENDATIONS Animals with Valley fever may act as sentinels for risk of exposure for the humans that live in the same area. Monitoring disease in animals may help identify cases in humans. Based on these findings specific for LA County, VPH provides the following recommendations to veterinarians: Veterinarians should rule out Valley fever in local pets with respiratory disease, lung lesions seen on radi ographs, and proliferative bone diseases, especially in animals coming from endemic areas. If you suspect Valley fever in your patient, be sure to obtain a thorough travel history to help assess the local burden of the disease. Client Education: Educate pet owners to limit their pets' outdoor activities during dust storms and when there are nearby excavations. When possible, dust control, such as by wetting down work areas with water, should be performed during projects that involve excavation; this will reduce the likelihood of inhaling fungal spores. Pet owners should discourage their pets from digging in soil.

The most recent outbreak was during 2020 -2021. Sporadic cases of distemper are also reported in dogs, often in dogs that are imported or have an unknown history. Distemper is a vaccine preventable disease and dogs should receive the initial puppy vaccination series as well as boosters. BACKGROUND Distemper is caused by canine distemper virus, a paramyxovirus. It is a highly contagious disease that affects dogs as well as many species of wildlife, including raccoons, foxes, skunk, and coyotes. Transmission occurs through aerosolized droplet secretions and infection can result in fever, gastrointestinal, and respiratory symptoms before progressing to pneumonia and/or neurologic signs. The virus is inactivated by most disinfectants. In LA County, VPH typically sees distemper reported in two groups of animals. First are dogs that are imported or have an unknown origin and/or are not fully vaccinated. These dogs may come from rescues or are purchased online or from an unknown source and are frequently noted to come from Mexico. The second group of affected animals is local wildlife. VPH sees outbreaks of distemper in local wildlife every few years, most recently during 2020 -2021. While fortunately we do not typically see confirmed cases of spread from wildlife to pets, these outbreaks are a good reminder of the importance of vaccination in our pets to prevent spread. Historically, VPH has seen sporadic increases in distemper in raccoons and other wildlife (Figure 1). From August 2014 through April 2015, 129 confirmed or suspect cases were documented across the southern part of Los Angeles County. In early 2017, a clust er of cases was noted in the east San Gabriel Valley and then from August 2017 through August 2018, 396 confirmed or suspect cases of distemper in raccoons were reported throughout LA County, with many cases in the South Bay area as well as the San Fernando and Santa Clarita Valleys (Figure 2). Numbers of cases reported in these outbreaks have typically peaked in the winter months 60 DISTEMPER CASES REPO RTED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, 2014- 2021 Figure 1 . Confirmed, suspect, and probable distemper cases reported in LA County during 2014 -2021. Wildlife includes raccoons, foxes, coyotes, skunks, and opossums with the majority being raccoons. . RACCOON DISTEMPER CASES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, 2017 -2018 Figure 2. Confirmed and suspect distemper cases in raccoons reported in LA County during 2017 -2018. 61 LOCAL DATA 2020- 2021 DISTEMPER OUTBREAK In late 2020, VPH received notifications from local animal control agencies that they were seeing an increased amount of wildlife with signs of distemper. Based on this VPH took several steps. We looked back earlier in the year and confirmed that there was an increase in reporting. Based on this finding, several carcasses from di fferent parts of LA C ounty were sent to CAHFS for necropsy to confirm distemper. All confirmed positive for distemper. Any wildlife with neurologic signs that were not sent for a full necropsy were submitted for rabies testing at the PHL, as the neurologic sympt oms of distemper are indistinguishable from the neurologic symptoms of rabies. All of these were negative for rabies. Then, VPH communicated with animal control agencies throughout LA C ounty regarding the outbreak, explaining which animals should be submitted for testing and which should be reported but not submitted. Finally, VPH sent several notifications regarding the outbreak to LA C ounty veterinarians via the Animal Health Alert Network , encouraging vac cination of dogs due to the risk of exposure from wildlife. From April 2020 through December 2021, VPH received reports of 319 raccoons, 3 coyotes, 17 foxes, 6 skunks, and 1 opossum with clinical signs consistent with distemper. Of these, there were 239 raccoons, 3 coyotes, 17 foxes, 5 skunks, and 1 opossum reported to have possible neurologic signs. 12 raccoons and 3 foxes were necropsied or tested and confirmed to have distemper (Figure 3). WILDLIFE DISTEMPER CASES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, 2020 -2021 Figure 3. Confirmed and suspect distemper cases in wildlife reported in LA County during 2020 -2021. 62 The initial cases were noted in the foothills of the east San Gabriel Valley, but eventually spread west along the San Gabriel Valley foothills into the San Fernando Valley and northwest into the Santa Clarita area. Clusters of cases were also reported in the Long Beach area and scattered cases were noted throughout the South Bay (Figure 4). The outbreak was considered to have slowed in December 2021 based on suspect wildlife cases being reported at a much lower rate. However, we are again seeing an uptick in cases after the first few months of 2022 including two confirm ed cases in raccoons, so the risk continues to be present. REPORTED CASES OF DISTEMPER IN WILDLIFE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, APRIL 2020 - DECEMBER 2021 Figure 4. Map of distemper cases in wildlife in Los Angeles County (n=336). 63 RECOMMENDATIONS Vaccinate dogs and puppies for distemper. Puppies should receive a series of 3 or more distemper vaccines between the ages of 2 and 4 months. The vaccine should be boostered a year later, then every three years for life. Keep puppies at home and away from unfamiliar dogs until they have completed the vaccination series. Use caution when socializing dogs or in areas where dogs congregate such dog parks, doggy day care and boarding facilities. Keep dogs away from wildlife. Educate owners to keep pet food and water indoors, away from wildlife so as not to attract wildlife which may spread distemper to dogs. Report confirmed or suspect cases to VPH.

Educate clients on measures to prevent flea -bo rne typhus including: 1) promoting effective flea control in pets and 2) reduce attractants to wildlife around their homes (trim vegetation, close up crawl spaces, do not leave food outside) Animal health care workers/shelter staff are more at risk for this disease -use personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, gowns) and insect repellent to protect staff at work. BACKGROUND Flea- borne typhus is a bacterial disease transmitted through flea bites from animals to people. It is also known as murine typhus or endemic typhus. Flea -borne typhus is endemic in Southern California, Southern Texas, and Hawaii. Many people are unfamiliar with this disease because it is not found in most areas of the United States . It is caused by the bacteria Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia felis. Animals are carriers of the infected fleas but are not symptomatic for this disease. Flea-borne typhus is spread through feces from an infected flea entering the body. Fleas defec ate while biting. People may become infected when they scratch a flea bite and drag flea feces across the bite wound, or when flea feces get into their eyes, nose, or mouth. An urban cycle of flea- borne typhus, involving rats and rat fleas, is present in downtown Los Angeles. Elsewhere in LA County the disease is transmitted within the suburban cycle , involving cats, opossums, other domestic and wild animals, and the cat flea. There is evidence that fleas can pass the bacteria to their offspring, making them not only a vector, but also a reservoir for typhus. Animals do not get sick from flea- borne typhus. Animals infected with the bacteria do not show clinical signs, nor do they spread the disease directly to people. However, flea -infested animals spread typhus in the community by increasing flea populations and transporting infected fleas to new areas. Clinical signs in humans can sometimes be severe. Most people who become ill develop fever, headache, chills, muscle pain, and sometimes a rash on the chest/back/legs. However, the disease can also spread to major organs or cause meningitis. Most reported c ases were severe, with about 80% being hospitalized. In 2018, there were clusters of flea- borne typhus in people in Downtown Los Angeles and in the Willowbrook area. In response to the outbreak in Skid Row, Veterinary Public Health partnered with Downtown Dog Rescue, Inner City Law Center and the City of Los Angeles Animal Services to provide free flea preventive products and pet- related services through a Pet Resource Center. In an effort to control and prevent future flea -borne typhus outbreaks, these monthly events aimed to assist residents experiencing homelessness and people in housing transition in both the Skid Row community and adjacent areas in the City of Los Angeles. 65 Animal health workers and shelter staff face a higher risk of exposure to fle a-borne typhus. Due to their close contact with flea -infested animals, veterinary staff, wildlife rehabilitators, and animal control workers are more likely to be exposed. LOCAL DATA The risk of human flea -borne typhus is increasing (Figure 1) . The number of cases in LA County has notably increased since 2010. In 2021, there were 137 human cases of human flea -borne typhus reported, the highest number case count ever documented in LA County . Cases occurred year -round and throughout the county, peaking in the summer and fall months. In 2021, LA County identified 3 localized outbreaks: 1) Monrovia (City & unincorporated), 2) Willowbrook (unincorporated community), and 3) Westlake (LA City neighborhood). The current 5 -year average is 81.6 cases per year, an increase from last year (74 cases per year). FLEA-BORNE TYPHUS, HUMAN CASES BY YEAR, LA COU NTY, 2000 - 2 021 Figure 1: Human cases of flea-borne typhus in LA County (excluding Lon g Beach and Pasadena) each year from 20 00 - 2021. For the 5 -year data, most cases were hospitalized, with an average hospital stay duration of 5 days. All reported cases were symptomatic. The most common symptoms reported were fever, headache, muscle pain, nausea/vomiting, chills. The most common exposures reported were dog and cats, followed by rodents and opossums. Approximately 1 in 4 cases (5 -year) and 1 in 5 cases (2020) reported an insect bite in the 10 days prior to symptom illness; not necessarily a flea bite . RECOMMENDATIONS Promote year -round flea control in pets. Proper flea control requires more than just using chemical flea control products. Flea eggs should be frequently removed from the home by 66 vacuuming and laundering pet bedding. Attracting feral and wild animals in the yard should be minimized by trimming vegetation, sealing crawl spaces, keeping trash sealed, picking up fallen fruit from trees and keeping pet food indoors. Protect your staff from fleas and flea feces. Make sure all staff use gloves or personal protective equipment when dealing with patients with flea infestations, and practice good hand washing habits. Consider wearing EPA -approved insect repellent while at work or in high -risk situations. Machine wash and dry all of your clothing in a hot cycle when you return home to ensure there are no eggs on them. Never relocate flea -infested wild or feral animals. Moving fleas spreads this disease. Talk with your health care provider if you notice symptoms in yourself and be sure to discuss your exposure to fleas on animals.

While the majority of cases are infected when the pet is outside of Southern California, 19.5% of ca ses are infected locally. In 2014, heartworm became reportable in LA County by animal diagnostic laboratories, leading to a dramatic increase in the amount of available data that year. Cases are categorized as \"confirmed\", \"probable\", or \"suspected\" by fol lowing for heartworm disease, available at: publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/surveillance.htm. In the past few years, three new invasive mosquito species be came established in certain areas of LA County: the Asian tiger mosquito ( Aedes Fever mosquito Australian backyard notoscriptus ). All three are drought -resistant, may bite in daytime, and are capable vectors for multiple diseases. The first two mosquitoes are potential vectors for Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses in humans, and heartworm in animals. The third species is an ideal vector for heartworm. More than ever, veterinarians need to i nclude mosquito control as a core part of their heartworm prevention information for pet owners. LOCAL DATA Heartworm is transmitted locally. Between 2012 and 2021, a total of 604 cases were reported in 580 dogs and 24 cats. 19.5% of these cases had not traveled outside of Southern California, and therefore had been infected locally (Figure 1, Figure 2) . 68 HEARTWORM CASES REPORTED IN LA COUNTY, 2012 -2021 BY LOCATION WHERE INFECTION ACQUIRED Figure 1. Heartworm cases reported in LA County, 2012 -2021, by where infection acquired (n=604). HEARTWORM CASES IN LA COUNTY , 2012- 2021 BY LOCATION WHERE INFECTION ACQUIRED Figure 2. Map of heartworm cases in LA County from 2012 -2021 showing where infection was acquired where home address was known (n=566) . Case Categories So Cal -acquired - Pet did not travel outside of Southern California Imported into So Cal - Pet traveled outside of Southern California and likely contracted the infection outside of area Unknown - Not enough history available about pet Mosquitoes breed in standing water. Hundreds of mosquitos can breed in a bottlecap full of water. Teach your clients to locate and empty any standing water on their property 1- 2 times weekly. 69 Most cases are asymptomatic. Of the cases where clinical signs were reported, 79.9% of cases had no clinical signs at the time of diagnosis. Multiple species of local mosquitoes can transmit heartworm. Since 2011, the arrival of three new species of invasive mosquitoes may have increased the risk of local transmission further. Untreated animals are reservoirs. Coyotes and completely untreated dogs can maintain heartworm in the local mosquito population. Pets in LA County should be tested annually for heartworm to identify potential reservoirs . RECOMMENDATIONS Teach pet owners to fight against mosquito breeding in stagnant water. o Tell clients to remove standing water around their property 1 -2 times weekly. Even a bottle cap full of water can breed mosquitoes. o Large bodies of stagnant water, such as neglected swimming pools, should be reported to the local vector control agency . o Mosquitos can transmit various diseases to both humans and pets, more than just heartworm. Use heartworm preventatives all yea r long. Most of these medications have the added benefit of preventing zoonotic intestinal parasites. Test for heartworm. Include heartworm testing as part of a pet's yearly physical checkup and for newly adopted or rescued dogs. Slow kill treatment is not recommended. The American Heartworm Society (AHS) does not recommend the slow kill method of treatment for heartworm. This method can take up to a year and usually much longer to achieve results, allowing more time for irreversible damage to the dog' s pulmonary system and vasculature. Slow kill is less effective in eliminating adult worms, the timing of worm death is unpredictable, and it requires strict compliance and exercise restriction for the entire duration of treatment, all of which may lead to increased risk of pulmonary thromboembolism. Consider heartworm disease before transporting or relocating a dog . Whether it is domestic or international relocation, knowing a dog's heartworm status and the appropriate monitoring and treatment recommenda tions are key to ensuring that they are not serving as reservoirs for disease in their new community and to ensure proper monitoring and treatment.

For more information: publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/heartworm.htm 70 LEPTOSPIROSIS, LOS ANGELES COUNTY KEY MESSAGES Leptospirosis is present and likely underdiagnosed in LA County. Although historically most leptospirosis cases in pet dogs have likely been due to wildlife exposure, a large outbreak in 2021 was linked to exposure to dogs, especially in congregate setting s like boarding facilities/dog daycares. Leptospirosis is a vaccine preventable disease. VPH recommends the 4 -way vaccine to protect against four common serovars, particularly if the dog boards or goes to dog daycare . BACKGROUND Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution caused by Leptospira species of spirochete bacteria. Leptospirosis has been reported in many mammalian species including humans, dogs, rats, mice, raccoons, skunks, opossums, horses, cows, and pigs. There are hundreds of serovars that are adapted to different animal reservoir hosts and immunity is serogroup specific (serogroups are groups of related serovars). 1 Leptospirosis is most commonly spread by exposure to the urine of infected animals. This may occur through direct contact (such as at a congregate facility), or when water or soil are contaminated. Wildlife may contaminate water bowls, fountains, or ponds while exploring backyards. Humans and animals can contract leptospirosis when there is contact throu gh the eyes, nose, mouth, or broken skin with water contaminated by the urine of an infected animal. 1 Leptospirosis is also an occupational hazar d for people with professions in the outdoors or with animals, a risk for people who participate in camping and water sports, and a risk in natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes. LOCAL DATA Leptospirosis can cause variable symptoms in dogs including fever, lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, and uveitis. Severe cases may develop renal or hepatic failure, or pulmonary hemorrhage. In LA County in 2014, leptospirosis became reportable by animal diagnostic laboratories, leading to increased reporting. However, it is believed to be underdiagnosed. A total of 62 cases of leptospirosis in dogs were reported from 2014 to 2020 (Figure 1, 2).2 Cases were reported from throughout LA County and most of these cases involved dogs that were apparently infected in their 1 Sykes, J.

Leptospirosis cases reported in dogs in LA County during 2014 -2020. REPORTED CASES OF LEPTOSPIROSIS IN DOGS IN L A COUNTY, 2014- 2020 Figure 2. Map of leptospirosis cases in dogs in Los Angeles County (n=59). 2021 Outbreak - In July 2021, VPH w as notified by a local veterinarian about several leptospirosis cases in dogs potentially associated with attendance at a boarding/daycare facility (Facility A). VPH followed 72up with the owner of Facilit y A who was aware of the illnesses and was working on a response to include sanitation, notifying clients, and requiring leptospirosis vaccination. In early August, VPH received simil ar reports from other local veterinarians regarding a second boarding/daycare facility (Facility B). This owner was also aware of ongoing illnesses and was working on a response. VPH visited both facilities to advise regarding sanitation, zoonotic potential, and othe r recommendations. VPH also sent several notifications regarding the outbreak to LA County veterinarians via the Anima l Health Alert Network . The outbreak was considere d to have ended in January 2022 base d on cases being reported at a much lower rate. Based on laboratory and epidemiologic al evidence, the Leptospira serov ar Canico la was the likely cause of this outbreak. There were 199 reported cases reported by LA County veterinarians. This includes four cases from out of county, two which were exposed in LA County. 8.0% (14/174) of cases resulte d in death at the time of report ing. Of the cases with data available, 55.8% (92/165) of dogs were hospitalized, and 65.8% (102/155) of dogs had exposures at dog dayca re or boarding facilities. The epidemic curve for this outbreak with information about daycare/boarding status is below (Figure 3). Most affected dogs either live in or had exposures on the west side of LA County or the San Fernando Valley (Figure 4). There were two large clusters of cases (over 35 dogs each) at two separate daycare/boarding facilities. Additionally, 48.1% (51/106) of cases reported going to dog parks. Owners also reported hiking, going to beaches, and walks around the neighborhood as potential routes of exposure, although there were a few dogs with no known exposure outside of their home or yard.

This map includes cases that reside in Pasadena and Long Beach. In recent years, there have been leptospirosis outbreaks among dogs in both Maricopa County, AZ , and San Diego County, CA.3,4 Both areas typically have a low prevalence of leptospirosis, similar to LA County . Although there was no definitive link to either of these regions, seeing several recent outbreaks of leptospirosis in the Southwest in areas where the disease has not previ ously been seen frequently support recommending leptospirosis vaccination for dogs, and particularly recommending that congregate facilities require leptospirosis vaccination. This outbreak also raised awareness of the disease and may increase suspicion of leptospirosis and thus reporting in the future. 3 Iverson SA, Levy C, Yaglom HD, et al.

Only 4.8% (8/166) of dogs in the 2021 outbreak were reported to be vaccinated. Educate clients on how to avoid attracting wildlife into yards. Clients should keep food and water bowls inside the home and routinely clean them with hot water and soap in case they have been contaminated by wildlife. Educate clients and veterinary staff about the zoonotic potential of leptospiros is and the recommended ways to reduce exposure. Report leptospirosis cases to VPH: http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/docs/Forms/LeptospirosisReportForm.pdf 75 SARS- COV -2 INFECTION IN PETS, LOS ANGELES COUNTY KEY MESSAGES SARS- CoV-2 is an evolving disease. This information was current at the time of printing. There is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading SARS -CoV-2 to humans. Cats and dogs are the primary domestic animals affected and serologic surveys have found up to 40% of pets exposed to people with COVID- 19 have antibodies. Consider that anima ls presenting with respiratory signs may have been exposed to a person with COVID- 19. BACKGROUND SARS- CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID- 19 in humans, resulting in the pandemic that is ongoing at the time of printing. It is an enveloped, positive sense , single stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae . SARS- CoV-2 is thought to have originated from an animal host, but research into the specific origin of SARS- CoV-2 is ongoing. Animals do not appear to play a significant role in the spread of SARS -CoV-2 to people and when infected, typically have mild symptoms. Clinical signs may include fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, nasal/ocular discharge, vomiting, and diarrhea. New evidence shows that many animals exposed to people with COVID- 19 will become infected and test positive for SARS- CoV-2 antibodies, even if they are asymptomatic5,6. Pet owners can spread the virus to animals, especially given the typical close contact between a pet and their owner. Domestic small animal species confirmed to be naturally infected with SARS- CoV-2 include cats, dogs, ferrets, and hamsters. Active surveillance is ongoing in many parts of the U.S. and in some studies up to 40.0% of dogs and cats in COVID- 19 p ositive households have been infected with SARS- CoV-2 7. As of April 8, 2022, USDA/APHIS had identified 362 confirmed cases in dogs and cats in the United States tested by National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL). However, the USDA only confirms the first dog and cat case for each state. After that although the animal may have tested positive by another government, university or commercial lab, these cases are only considered presumptively positive and are not reported nationally. As such, this count is not representative and is lower than the total number of positive pets detected throughout the country. 5 Fritz, M., Rosolen, B., Krafft, E., Becquart, P., Elguero, E., Vratskikh, O., ... & Leroy, E.

Each came from a household where a person tested positive for COVID- 19. The clinical signs of the pets ranged from asymptomatic to upper respiratory signs . Coughing was a symptom reported in each of the symptomatic cases. Treatment varied from observation to hospitalization for less than a week. One of these four (25.0%) pets died, but this animal had a significant comorbidity.

Animals have tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID -19), both in the U.S. and other countries, mostly after close contact with people with COVID -19. Most pets have no symptoms or very mild respiratory symptoms and recover without treatment. At this time, the risk of animals spreading COVID- 19 to people is considered to be low. 2.I have a pet. What should I do? Although the risk of COVID- 19 infection in pets is low, there are other diseases that can cause illness in animals and spread from animals to people. Because of this, maintaining good hygiene around animals is always a good idea. Include pets in your family's preparedness planning. 3.I am sick with COVID -19 and I have pets or other animals. What should I do? You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID -19, just like you would around other people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a facemask or face covering. Also, please notify your public health point of contact that you have animals in your home. 4.Can I walk my dog if I am under quarantine or isolation? No. If you were placed under a 10 -day quarantine after possible exposure or you are feeling sick and are under isolation for possible or confirmed COVID - 19, you cannot leave your home during that period. Have a family member take your dog for walks during that time. Alternately, ask or hire someone else to walk your dog. When the person arrives to take your dog for a walk, both of you should be wearing face coverings and strive to stay 6 feet or more apart. Wash your hands both before and after the process of transferring the dog between people. Consider having the dog walker use their own leash. 5.How can I safely take my pet to the veterinarian? It is up to each individual veterinary practice to decide on the ir procedures related to masks and allowing clients to come back into the hospital. Typically, the clinic will requir e all customers to wear masks, require proof of immunization , or post signs and rely on an honor system. People who are not fully vaccinate d for COVID -19 should continue to wear masks when visiting veterinary hospitals. Call your veterinarian in advance and work with them Key Messages: At this time, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Howe ver, pets can spread other diseases to people, so wash your hands after handling pets and animals. Pro per veterinary care will always help to keep both pets and people healthy and safe.

If you are sick and your pet needs to see a veterinarian, try to arrange for someone else to take your pet in and alert the facility before your pet arrives so they can prepare. There are simple steps you can take to protect the health of your pet and family: Get vaccinated against COVID -19. o Visit the COVID -19 Vaccine - LA County Department of Public Health Website to learn more and myturn.c a.gov to schedule an appointment. Establish a relationship with a veterinarian for your pet. Keep your pet's vaccinations current and use flea and tick control. Wash your hands after handling your pet, their bedding, toys, and food/water bowls. If you are sick, keep your distance from other people and pets and wash your hands frequently. If your pet is sick, contact a veterinarian. Keep your pet away from other animals until t hey are better. Wash your hands each time after caring for them. 83Due\u00f1os de Mascotas - Preguntas Frecuentes Enfermedad por Coronavirus (COVID Los Angeles County Department of Public Health http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/ 6/22/21 Pet Owners FAQ 1.\u00bfPueden las riesgo de que los animales a a las mascotas la planificaci\u00f3n de preparaci\u00f3n de familia. 3.Estoy facial o una cubierta facial.

With this threat, it's more important than ever for you to keep strict biosecurity measures at your poultry operations and watch your birds closely for any s igns of the disease. We need you to quickly report problems in your flocks and work with us to respond. Your help will be vital in protecting the U.S. poultry industry from this deadly disease. The faster we can respond and depopulate sick birds, the fas ter we can stop the virus from spreading. Be on the lookout for HPAI. Here's what to watch for, where to report, and what to expect from State and Federal responders if you have a suspected case in your birds. Know the Warning Signs Sudden increase in bird deaths without any clinical signs Lack of energy and appetite Decrease in egg production Soft- or thin -shelled or misshapen eggs Swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles, and hocks Purple discoloration of the wattles, comb, and legs Gasping for air (difficulty breathing) Coughing, sneezing, and/or nasal discharge (runny nose) Stumbling or falling down Diarrhea Report It! If your birds are sick or dying, report it right away. This is one of the most important things you can do to keep HPAI fr om spreading. Call: Your flock or local veterinarian, The State v eterinarian, The State animal health/poultry diagnostic laboratory, or USDA toll -free at 1-866-536-7593 .HPAI in Poultry: What To Expect If You Suspect USDA file photo Complete paralysis USDA file photo Swelling of the tissue around the eyes and neck HPAI is a deadly disease for poultry. It can infect all types of chi ckens and turkeys, plus many other kinds of birds. HPAI can strike suddenly and spread fast. It is devastating for poultry industries. APPENDIX E 86 ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICE What To Expect Next After you report, a Federal or State animal health official will contact you to learn more about your flock and operation. If we suspect HPAI in your flock, response personnel will come to your operation quickly and work with you on the steps below. Sample Collection A Federal or State animal health official will take samples from live birds, dead birds, and/or your barn for testing. The samples then go to the closest diagnostic laboratory, and you can expect initial results within 24 hours. U ntil the results come back, we consider your operation a suspect HPAI case. This means we work with you to put measures in place that guard against any further disease spread. Quarantine The State will quarantine your facility. Only authorized workers are allowed in and out of your property, and the movement of poultry, poultry products, and equipment is also restricted. This is to help make sure the virus, if present, does not keep spreading. Inventory USDA will start working with you to inventory your p oultry. If the laboratory confirms HPAI, this information helps us appraise your flock and provide the value of your depopulated birds . In order to receive indemnity , the owner or grower must certify that a biosecurity plan was in place prior to an HPAI detection. In 2016, APHIS issued an interim rule that allows for split payments between owners and contract growers. We will also offer a standard amount to cover cost s for virus elimination activities at your operation (cleanup work). If Your Flock Tests Positive for HPAI If the test results are positive, a State or Federal veterinary medical officer (VMO) will notify you immediately. We will then assign a case manage r who will be onsite to guide you through the next phase of the response and answer any questions you may have. Your case manager will work closely with you as we prepare to depopulate your flock and find out, as best we can, how HPAI may have entered your facility and if it has spread to any neighboring farms. Our goal is to depopulate your flock within 24 hours of first detecting HPAI. This 24 -hour window is critical. By acting quickly, we can keep the virus from building up in the environment and sprea ding further. We have several depopulation methods we can use to meet the 24 -hour goal and will work with you to figure out the best option.

The recommendations contained herein are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to reflect the current status of rabies and rabies prevention activities in California. Updates are based on current rabies research and scientific literature, rabies prevention guidelines published by the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 1, 2 and by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians3, California state statute and regulations, and established rabies control practices and procedures. Recommendations by state and federal experts and existing standards of practice outlined in this document are intended to provide guidance to individuals and agencies involved with rabies prevention and control in California. Except for statutes and regulations specifically cited, the information provided in this document are recommendations provided for informational purposes only and are not intended to be regulatory in effect. California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part I, Page 2 A. Principles of rabies control 1. Human rabies prevention Human rabies can be prevented by a) eliminating exposure to rabies virus, b) providingappropriate rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis, and c) prompt local treatment of bitewounds combined with appropriate rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. Human rabiespre- and post-exposure prophylaxis are addressed in Part II of the Compendium. 2. Domestic animal rabies control The California Health and Safety Code (HSC) \u00a7121690 mandates that the governingbody of each city, city and county, or county maintain or provide a rabies control sheltersystem and a rabies control program. The primary components of a rabies control program for companion animals are: immunization and licensing; stray animal control;reporting, investigation, and isolation of animals involved in bite incidents; and publiceducation. 3. Wild animal rabies control Rabies virus is maintained in populations of wild animals and occasionally spills overinto domestic animals and humans. In California, skunks and bats comprise over 90percent of animal rabies cases reported each year. Prevention and control of rabies inbats and terrestrial mammals pose considerable challenges. It is generally not possibleor desirable to control rabies by reducing the size of wild carnivore or bat populations.Selective population reduction may be attempted in terrestrial rabies outbreaks oflimited geographic scope, but these efforts can be labor and resource intensive andprovide effective control only until immigratio n or reintroduction of the incriminated species. Immunization of wildlife by widespread distribution of vaccine-impregnated oralbaits has shown variable success toward arresting the propagation of rabies inraccoons and coyotes in other states. The effectiveness of oral rabies vaccinationprograms has not been demonstrated for skunks and such programs would be infeasible for bats. Principles of rabies prevention should focus on excluding wild animals from areas of human and domestic animal habitation and activity, an d avoida nce of contact with pos sibly rabid wild animals. Pub lic education on the risks of rabies transmission from wild animals is pa ramount to effective disease preventi on.Part I. Animal Rabies Control 89California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part I, Page 3 B. R abies control methods for do mestic and confined animals 1. Animal bite reporting (Title 17, Ca lifornia Code of Regulations [CCR], \u00a72606) The local health officer or designee shall be immediately notified of any person or animal bitten by or potentially exposed to a rabid or suspected rabid animal. In addition,the local health officer or designee shall be notified when any person is bitten by amammal. Potential human rabies exposures are then evaluated and rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) recommendations made. 2. Isolation of biting animals (17 CCR \u00a72606) a) General considerations Dogs, cats, and ferrets that bite a human or another dog, cat, or ferret are subject to isolation and observation, or euthanasia and testing. If the bite is judged by the local health officer to be unusual or to represent an increased risk for rabies (e.g., unprovoked attacks, bites to the face, or considerable deep ti ssue damage), the animal should be euthanized and tested immediately. The National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians recommends that if an animal under isolation develops clinical signs suggestive of rabies, the animal should be humanely euthanized and the head submitted for rabies testing through the local public health laboratory 3. Any unclaimed or stray animal that bites a human may be euthanized and the head promptly submitted to the local public health laboratory for rabies testing. Protocols for submitting samples for rabies testing are available from the local public health laboratory. Rabies or other immunizations should not be administered to a dog, cat, or ferret during isolation because adverse reactions may be misinterpreted as clinical signs of rabies. 3 b) Dogs and cats (17 CCR \u00a7 2606(b)(2)) Domestic dogs and cats that bite or otherwise expose humans must be isolated in strict confinement and in compliance with the local health officer's isolation order. The biting dog or cat must be either a) observed daily for signs of rabies for ten (10) days following the exposure date, regardless of the animal's vaccination status, or b) euthanized immediately and tested for rabies in a public health laboratory. If an isolated dog or cat is healthy at the end of the ten-day period, there is no risk of a rabies exposure from the original bite wound. c) FerretsIt is illegal in California to possess a ferret as a pet (California Fish and Game Code [FGC] \u00a72118). Nevertheless, bites from these animals occur. If a ferret bites a human in California, it should be isolated in strict confinement and in compliance with the local health officer's isolation order. The biting ferret should be either a) observed daily for signs of rabies for ten (10) days following the exposure date, regardless of the animal's vaccination status, or b) euthanized immediately and tested for rabies in a public health laboratory. Biting ferrets should be confiscated by California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part I, Page 4 the anim al control agency and isolations conducted under the direction of the local health officer in an animal control shelter or veterinary hospital. If an isolated ferret is healthy at the end of the ten-day period, there is no risk of a rabies exposure from the original bite wound. Because pet ferrets are illegal in California, any ferret isolated for a human bite should be reported to the California Department of Fish and Game for disposition following the isolation. d) Other domestic a nd nondomestic species The incubation period, clinical presentation, and pre-clinical period of rabies virus shedding are well described only for dogs, cats, and ferrets. The period in which other domestic, nondomestic, and wild animals shed rabies virus prior to showing clinical signs of rabies is generally not known. Biting wild, nondomestic, or domestic animals other than dogs, cats, and ferrets should not be isolated for observation but should be euthanized and tested for rabies immediately. While isolation of biting animals other than dogs, cats, and ferrets is not recommended for the reasons given above, local health officers have the prerogative to forego euthanasia and testing in rare special circumstances. If the biting animal has a comprehensive and reliable history that precludes opportunity for exposure to rabies virus, and the risk of rabies in the biting animal is judged by the health officer to be acceptably low, the health officer may institute a prolonged (30-day) isolation of the biting animal. Under the care of a physician, the bite victim could be started immediately on rabies PEP. This special allowance can be considered due to the low risk for exposure, the reliable efficacy of rabies PEP, and the low incidence of serious adverse reactions with that treatment. 3. Isolation of animals exposed to rabies (17 CCR \u00a72606) Any animal bitten by, scratched by, or having direct contact with a wild mammal(especially bats and skunks) that is not available for rabies testing should be regarde d as having been exposed to rabies. a) Dogs, cats, and ferrets Dogs, cats, and ferrets that are currently vaccinated should be revaccinated immediately and placed in strict isolation for 30 days. While isolation provisions are at the discretion of the local health officer, \"strict isolation\" must preclude contact between the isolated animal and other animals and the public. Any other dogs, cats, or ferrets for which contact with the bitten animal cannot be absolutely prevented during the isolation period should be held to the same restrictions for the entire isolation period. Ferrets must be confiscated by the animal control agency and isolation conducted under the direction of the health officer in an animal control shelter or veterinary hospital. Because ferrets are illegal to possess as pets in California, any ferret must be reported to the California Department of Fish and Game for disposition following the isolation. Unvaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets exposed to a rabid or suspect rabid animal should be euthanized immediately .3 An 90California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part I, Page 5 alternative to euthanasia is immediate vaccination of the animal and placement in strict isolation for six months (180 days). Euthanasia is strongly recommended for unvaccinated juvenile animals due to their hi gher susceptibility to rabies infection. Protocols for the post-exposure vaccination of previously unvaccinated animals have not been validated, and there is evidence that the use of vaccine alone in a post-exposure setting may not prevent the disease. b) Livestock All livestock species\u2014horses, cattle, sheep, goats, llamas/alpacas, swine--are susceptible to rabies infection. Cattle and horses are the livestock species most frequently diagnosed with rabies. Unvaccinated livestock bitten or exposed to a rabid or suspect rabid animal should be euthanized. 3 If the animal is slaughtered within seven days after being exposed, the tissues may be consumed without risk of infection, provided liberal portions of the exposed area are discarded. However, the slaughtered animal cannot be sold commercially as a source of food; federal (United States Department of Agriculture [USDA]) meat inspectors are required to reject for slaughter any animal known to have been exposed to rabies within the past eight months. 3 Neither tissue nor milk from a rabid animal should be used for human or animal consumption.3 However, because heat inactivates rabies virus, persons who inadvertently drink pasteurized milk or eat fully cooked meat from an animal subsequently identified as rabid are not considered to have been exposed to rabies. An alternative to euthanizing exposed livestock is to vaccinate the animal immediately with an approved vaccine and to place it in strict isolation for six months during which time the animal may not be transported, sold, or slaughtered unless approved by the local health officer and the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Livestock that are currently vaccinated should receive a rabies booster immediately and be placed in strict isolation for 30 days. 3 In general, an isolation order for the entire herd is not indicated unless the animals have been held in close confinement that would allow for multiple animals exposed to the same rabies source (e.g., a wild animal). It is unusual to have more than one rabid animal in a herd. In such cases, it is more likely that multiple animals were exposed by a single rabid wild animal or dog than that rabies virus was transmitted from herbivore to herbivore. Animals in a herd where a rabies death has occurred should be examined immediately for evidence of bite exposures. c) Wild, nondomestic, and other mammals Wild, nondomestic, and other mammals bitten by or exposed to a rabid or suspect rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. 3 4. Animal rabies vaccination a) Rabies vaccine administration (HSC \u00a7121690, \u00a7121700) California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part I, Page 6 Animal rabies vaccines are restricted for sale to licensed veterinarians, biological supply companies, and government agencies that conduct rabies control programs. All animal rabies vaccines are restricted to use by, or under the supervision of, a California-licensed veterinarian. The level of supervision shall be consistent with Title 16, CCR, \u00a72034-2036.5 of the California Veterinary Medicine Practice Act. The veterinarian whose signature is on the rabies certificate retains legal responsibility that the person administering the vaccine is appropriately trained in vaccine storage, handling, administration, and management of adverse events. 3 Rabies vaccines should be administered in accordance with the specifications of the vaccine product label or package insert. Rabies vaccine should be administered in a new, sterile needle and syringe. The re-use of cleaned and sterilized needles and syringes is strongly discouraged. Single use of the needle and syringe is consistent with vaccine manufacturers' recommendations. b) Accidental human exposure to rabies vaccine Accidental human inoculation may occur during administration of an animal rabies vaccine. Such exposure to inactivated rabi es vaccine does not constitute a risk for rabies infection. c) Contraindications and adverse events There are no absolute contraindications to administration of rabies vaccine to appropriate species. Veterinarians should, if possible, postpone vaccinating animals that are ill or immunocompromised to ensure a robust immune response. There is no epidemiologic association between a particular licensed vaccine product and adverse events, including vaccine failure. Adverse reactions to vaccination should be reported to the USDA, Center for Veterinary Biologics ( USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Adverse Event Reporting , Tel: 800-752-6255, e-mail: CVB@usda.gov). Beginning in the 1990s, an association between the administration of certain vaccines, including rabies, and the development of cancer (sarcoma) in some cats was identified. However, this risk appears to be extremely low (1-2 cases per 10,000 vaccinated cats). The public health implicatio ns of rabies in domestic cats outweigh the low risk of a sarcoma developing at a vaccination site. To facilitate management of vaccine-associated sarcomas, to avoid in jection of multiple vaccines at a single site (a putative risk factor for sarcoma formation), and to aid in documenting vaccine placement, the American Association of Feline Practitioners recommends that rabies vaccine be administered subcutaneously on the right hind limb distal to the stifle joint. d) Canine rabies vaccination (HSC \u00a7121690; 17 CCR \u00a72606.4, \u00a72606.6) The owner of every dog over the age of four months must ensure that the dog is vaccinated for rabies by a licensed veterinarian and secure a license for the pet as provided by local city or county ordinance. A current rabies vaccination certificate 91California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part I, Page 7 must accompany dogs over four months of age entering the state. Dogs less than four months of age must be confined at home or kept under close leash supervision by the owner when off property. Twenty-eight days after primary vaccination peak rabies antibody level is reached and a dog is considered currently vaccinated for one year. 3 Regardless of the age of the dog at primary vaccination, a booster vaccination should be given one year later. All vaccines approved for use in dogs in California follow a three-year booster schedule thereafter. There are no laboratory or epidemiologic data to support the annual or biennial administration of three-year vaccines following the initial immunization series. Because a rapid anamnestic response is expected, a dog is considered currently vaccinated immediately after receiving a booster vaccination. An animal that is overdue for a rabies booster should be vaccinated as soon as possible and the three-year booster schedule re-established. 3 Only canine rabies vaccines licensed by USDA and approved by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) can be used in the California Rabies Control Program (17 CCR \u00a72651). The rabies vaccines currently approved for use in California are listed in Part III of the Compendium. e) Feline rabies vaccination Vaccination of domestic cats for rabies is not mandated by California statute. However, because cats are the domestic species that is most frequently reported as rabid in the United States, feline rabies vaccination is required by some local ordinances and is strongly recommended for all cats. A USDA-licensed feline rabies vaccine should be administered according to the vaccine label instructions (see Part III of the Compendium). Cats are considered currently vaccinated from 28 days to one year following primary vaccination, and 1, 3, or 4 years following booster vaccinations, depending on the vaccine used. 3 f) Ferret rabies vaccination It is illegal in California to possess a ferret as a pet (FGC \u00a72118). Nevertheless, owners of illegally kept ferrets may occasionally seek veterinary care (California Business and Professional Code \u00a74826.2). As a public health measure, veterinarians should vaccinate ferrets against rabies using a USDA-licensed rabies vaccine administered according to vaccine label instructions (see Part III of the Compendium). Ferrets are considered currently vaccinated from 28 days to one year following primary vaccination, and for one year following each booster. 3 g) Livestock rabies vaccination Routine vaccination of all livestock against rabies is economically impractical. However, vaccination of horses and livestock with a USDA licensed vaccine (see California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part I, Page 8 Part III of the Compendium) should be considered in areas where wildlife rabies is highly endemic, for valuable individual animals, for horses kept in boarding stables or racetracks or traveling in ter-state, and for animals having frequent contact with humans (e.g., petting zoos). 3 h) Wildlife and non-domesti c rabies vaccination No rabies vaccines are licensed for use in animal species other than dogs, cats, cattle, horses, sheep, and ferrets in the U.S. The effectiveness of rabies vaccination in other species is unknown. Because of their susceptibility to rabies, wild carnivores and bats should not be kept as pets. 3 Bats and certain species of carnivores may not enter California without an importation permit from CDPH (17 CCR \u00a730070-86) and are subject to a 90-day rabies quarantine upon importation into California. Carnivores and bats must be housed in a manner that precludes direct contact with the public. 3 Due to the special rabies risk, the trapping, transport, sale, and exchange of skunks in California is prohibited (17 CCR \u00a7 2606.8). Zoos and research institutions may establish vaccination programs intended to protect valuable animals, but these programs do not substitute for appropriate preventive measures to protect humans. The effectiveness of rabies vaccination in the progeny of domestic dogs or cats bred to wild animals (e.g., wolf-dog hybrids, civet-cat hybrids) is unknown. Complete rabies vaccine challenge and viral shedding studies have not been conducted for these animals. There is no definitive evidence that the vaccine is protective in these animals. Vaccination may afford some rabies protection to the animal; however, there are no rabies vaccines currently licensed for use in wild animals or in wild-domestic animal hybrids. Vaccination of these animals is considered an extra-label use of a biologic. State law does not prohibit the use of rabies vaccines in domestic-wild animal hybrids. However, it is illegal to license domestic-wild canine hybrids as \"dogs\" under the California Rabies Control Program because they are considered wild animals (14 CCR \u00a7671(c)(2)(K)). A rabies vaccine certificate issued for a vaccinated hybrid must identify the animal as a \"domestic-wild animal hybrid.\" Local jurisdictions may institute domestic dog-wolf hybrid permitting programs and issue such permits in order to identify these animals in the community (HSC \u00a7121695). Canine or feline hybrids previously vaccinated are nonetheless considered \"unvaccinated\" for purposes of isolation/observation in the event of a bite incident or contact with a rabid or suspect rabid animal. All hybrids are considered \"wild animals\" under these circumstances and managed according to sections 2(d) and 3(c) in this Compendium. 3 i) Canine licensing and vaccination procedure (17 CCR \u00a72606.4) The vaccination of all dogs four months of age or older is required for licensure. Completion of the licensing procedure consists of issuing a license tag or vaccination tag bearing the license data only after presentation of a current valid 92California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part I, Page 9 official rabies vacci nation certificate. Official rabies vaccination certificates must contain the following information: a) name, address, and telephone number of the dog's owner; b) description of the dog, including breed, color, age, and sex; c) date of immunization; d) type of rabies vaccine administered; e) name of the manufacturer, product, and lot number of the rabies vaccine used. Each certificate must bear the signature of the veterinarian administering the vaccination or a signature authorized by him or her. The certificate must be stamped, printed, or typed with the vaccinating veterinarian's name, address, and telephone number. j) Rabies immunization exemptions (HSC \u00a7121690) A veterinarian may request from the local health officer an exemption from rabies vaccination for a dog for which the veterinarian determines that vaccination would endanger the dog's life because of disease or other considerations. If approved by the local health officer, the exempted dog may be issued a license but is considered unvaccinated and confined to the premises of the owner. Licensure of an exempted dog may not extend beyond one year; at or before the end of the one-year license period, the dog must be vaccinated for rabies or a request for vaccination exemption must be resubmitted to and reapproved by the local health officer. k) Rabies serologic testing Serologic evidence of rabies neutralizing antibodies in an animal is not a substitute for current rabies vaccination in managing rabies exposures or determining the need for booster vaccinations. 3 Serum antibody titer is a measure of the animal's response to vaccine or infection and not a reliable indicator of protection. Elevated serologic titers do not necessarily indicate protection from rabies, nor do low or undetectable serologic titers reflect absence of protection. An ability to measure and interpret all the immunologic factors that interact to protect against rabies is not well developed. 5. \"Actual cost\" rabies vaccination clinics (HSC 121690) Each city, city and county, or county shall provide or arrange for canine rabies vaccination clinics in the community. No char ge in excess of the actual cost may be made for vaccination administration. The CDPH establishes the actual cost that vaccination clinics may charge. Fees in excess of the CDPH-established actual cost require cost documentation and prior approval by CDPH. Procedures and forms to request approval are available by request from the CDPH Veterinary Public Health Section . California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part II, Page 1 A. Rabies postexposure prevention Prevention of rabies following a possible exposure to rabies virus consists of two fundamental components: immediate cleaning and medical attention of the site of virus deposition, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)--administration of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine. Persons who have transdermal or mucous membrane contact with saliva or nervous tissue from a confirmed rabid animal, whether by bite or other means, should begin rabies PEP immediately. Persons exposed to a suspected rabid animal should begin PEP if rabies testing of the animal is not immediately available. To appropriately manage potential human exposure to rabies, the risk of infection must be accurately assessed. It is important to remember that rabies PEP is a medical urgency, not a medical emergency. With the exception of direct inoculation of rabies virus into the central nervous system (e.g., severe bite to the head that penetrates the neurocranium), there is time for information to be assemb led and the risk to be rationally assessed. Nevertheless, decisions regarding PEP should not be delayed. Extensive field experience from many parts of the world indicates that prompt wound treatment, passive immunization, and vaccination are consistently effective in preventing development of clinical rabies when administered appropriately. However, rabies has developed in humans when recommended preventive protocols were not performed completely or correctly. Rabies PEP can be effective when initiated any time prior to onset of clinical disease. There have been many instances in which rabies PEP was not initiated until months after exposure due to delays in recognition of the exposure. Although onset of clinical rabies typically occurs between 60 and 90 days following exposure, incubation periods of one year or more have been reported. PEP should not be denied solely because a prolonged period of time has elapsed since the exposure event. 1. Rabies exposure Rabies exposure is defined as transdermal or mucous membrane contact with saliva\u2014 or, rarely, nervous tissue--from a rabid animal. A break in the cutaneous barrier that permits virus access to subdermal tissue ma y be created concomitant with (e.g., classic animal bite) or prior to (e.g., open wounds, abrasions, or scratches) deposition of saliva or contact with nervous tissue. Contact with other tissues (e.g. skin, hair, blood), secretions (e.g., skunk spray), or excretions (e.g., urine, feces) of a rabid animal does not constitute an exposure. Rabies virus is inactivated by exposure to ultraviolet radiation and by desiccation, though the exact time required to inactivate the virus varies according to environmental conditions. Dried saliva or neurologic tissue is Part II. Human Rabies Prevention 93California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part II, Page 2 generally considered noninfectious. Scenarios for secondary exposure or \"contact- transfer\" of rabies virus (e.g., dog bites a skunk and then licks a human) are hypothetical and very unlikely to transmit rabies. 2. Assessment of rabies exposure Anti-rabies biologics are generally safe and in ready supply. Nevertheless, PEP should be allocated judiciously and reserved for individuals for whom exposure to rabies virus is likely. Decisions on PEP are ultimately made by the exposed individual and his/her healthcare provider, following a thorough assessment of the exposure incident and consultation with public health officials. No single set of criteria can determine the appropriateness of PEP for all situations. PEP decisions should be based on as much information about the exposure incident as can be assembled in a timely fashion. Factors that should be considered in PEP decisions include: species of biting animal, the physical and mental health of the biting animal, whether the bite was provoked, the severity of the bite, whether immediate wound care was implemented, the availability of the biting animal for isolation/observation or euthanasia/testing, and the bite victim's personal anxiety about rabies. Concerns about the bite victim's pre-existing medical conditions or ability to pay should never preclude initiati on of PEP for an exposure incident in which PEP would be otherwise indicated (See Sections D and E). Bats represent an important reservoir for rabies that deserves special consideration. Epidemiologic data suggest that transmission of rabies virus from bats can occur from very minor or even unrecognized bites. The limited injury inflicted by a bat bite (in contrast to wounds caused by carnivores) and equivocal recall of recognized exposure can hinder a health-care provider's ability to assess the ri sk of rabies resulting from an encounter with a bat. Between 2000 and 2009, 18 human cases of rabies were identified in the U.S. with natural exposure to a bat variant virus. For only seven of these case-patients was a definite bat bite known; eight case-patients had known bat contact but no apparent bite, and for three case-patients no known contact with a bat was identified during the case investigation. In all instances in which a human is possibly exposed to a bat, the bat in question should be safely collected, if possible, and tested for rabies. Rabies PEP is recommended for all persons who experience a bite, scratch, or mucous membrane contact with a bat, unless the bat is available for testing and is negative for evidence of rabies. Rabies PEP may be appropriate even when a bite, scratch, or mucous membrane contact is not apparent if there is reasonable probability that such exposure might have occurred. Rabies PEP should be considered when direct contact between a bat and a human has occurred, unless the exposed person can be certain a bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposure did not occur. In instances in which an apparently healthy bat is found indoors and there is no history of bat-human contact, the likely effectiveness of rabies PEP must be balanced against the low risk that such exposures appear to California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part II, Page 3 present. In this setting, rabies PEP can be considered for persons who were in the same room as the bat and are uncertain whether a bite or direct contact occurred (e.g., a sleeping person awakens to find a bat in the room or an adult witnesses a bat in the room with a previously unattended child, mentally disabled person, or intoxicated person) and rabies cannot be ruled out by testing the bat. Rabies PEP would not be warranted for other household members. 3. Local treatment of wounds Immediate and thorough washing of any bite or scratch wound with soap and water is an indispensable measure in preventing rabies. Animal experiments have shown that simple local wound cleaning and irrigation can markedly reduce the likelihood of rabies. Victims of animal bites should consult with their healthcare provider; medical or surgical attention, a tetanus toxoid booster, and antibiotic prophylaxis may be indicated independent of the assessed risk of rabies transmission. 4. Passive immunization Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG) is administered only once, at the beginning of rabies PEP, to previously unvaccinated persons to provide immediate antibodies until the patient responds to rabies vaccination by actively producing antibodies. If HRIG is not given with the first dose of vaccine, it can be given up to Day 7 of the vaccine series. After Day 7, HRIG should be avoided due to possible interference with the developing vaccine immune response. HRIG is administered at a dose of 20 IU/kg body weight for all age groups. No more than the recommended dose of HRIG should be used due its potential to partially suppress active immunization. As much as possible of the calculated dose of HRIG should be infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissue and/or muscle around the wound site(s). Any remaining amount of HRIG should be administered intramuscularly at an anatomic site distant from vaccine administration. HRIG should never be administered in the same syringe or at the same anatomical site as vaccine and should never be administered in the gluteal area unless that is the site of exposure. In the absence of a bite or other known site of virus introduction, the full dose of HRIG should be administered at a si te distant from vaccine administration (e.g., contralateral deltoid). Regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of PEP, both HRIG and vaccine should be administered for both bite and nonbite exposures in persons not previously rabies immunized. 5. Active immunization Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV) or Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCEC) is administered in conjunction with HRIG at the beginning of postexposure treatment. A regimen of four 1-ml doses of HDCV or PCEC is given intramuscularly. The first dose should be given as soon as possible following an exposure (Day 0), with subsequent doses given on Days 3, 7, and 14. Vaccine should always be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid (lateral aspect of the upper arm). For pediatric patients, vaccine may be administered intramuscularly in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. 94California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part II, Page 4 Rabies vaccine should never be administered in the gluteal region, as this may result in lower, possibly inadequate neutralizing antibody levels. Rabies PEP should always include both vaccine and HRIG except in persons who have previously received complete immunization regimens (pre- or postexposure prophylaxis) with a cell culture vaccine, or persons previously vaccinated with another type of vaccine who have documentation of adequate rabies virus neutralization antibody titers. These persons should immediately receive two 1-ml booster doses of HDCV or PCEC vaccine administered intramuscularly on Days 0 and 3. Because antibody response has been universally satisfactory in persons receiving the currently recommended rabies PEP schedule, routine post-treatment serologic testing is not recommended. Verification of adequate neutralizing antibody levels by serologic testing may be indicated in unusual circumstances, such as when the patient is known to be immunosuppressed. Immunosuppressive agents should not be administered during rabies PEP unless they are essential for the treatment of other conditions. B. Pre-exposure prophylaxis Persons at frequent risk of exposure to rabies virus should consider pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreEP). Occupations considered to be in the \"frequent risk\" category include veterinarians, animal handlers, animal control officers, laboratory workers potentially exposed to rabies virus, and others who have frequent contact with mammals likely to have rabies. PreEP might be considered for other persons who are likely to have contact with potentially rabid animals, such as wild mammal rehabilitators and persons traveling to foreign countries where canine rabies is endemic. 1. Primary or pre-exposure vaccination Three 1.0 ml injections of HDCV or PCEC are administered intramuscularly in the deltoid (lateral aspect of the upper arm) on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28. Multiple studies have documented development of rabies antibodies that meet or exceed recommended neutralizing titers (>0.5 IU/ml) in all persons vaccinated according to this regimen. Persons who are immunosuppressed due to medication or illness should postpone PreEP if possible. Immunosuppressed persons who are at risk of rabies exposure can be vaccinated and should have their antibody titers measured following completion of the regimen. 2. Booster vaccination Routine rabies booster vaccination is not indicated for any pre-immunized group. The need for booster vaccination should be individually assessed based on current rabies antibody levels and the person's risk of exposure to rabies virus. Persons classified as having \"frequent risk\" (see B above) should have a serum sample tested for rabies neutralizing antibody every two years--or every six months for persons working with rabies virus in a laboratory setting--following PreEP. If the titer is less than complete neutralization at 1:5 by the Rapid Fluorescent Focus Inhibition Test (RFFIT), the person should receive a single booster dose of rabies vaccine. California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part II, Page 5 Several laboratories offer RFFIT testing at a cost of approximately $35-$45 per sample. Instructions for submission of samples and pricing are available by calling the numbers below. (RFFIT testing may also be available through other laboratories.)

Rabies immunizing products av ailable in the United States 1. Human rabies vaccine stimulates an active immune response including production of neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies develop in approximately 7-10 days and usually persist for at least 2 years. The two vaccines currently available in the U.S. are considered equally efficacious and safe when used as indicated. The 1.0 ml dose of either HDCV or PCEC can be used for PEP or PreEP. a) Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV) - Intramuscular \u0093 Rabies) HDCV is prepared from the Pitman-Moore rabies virus strain grown in MRC-5 human diploid cell culture. The vaccine is concentrated by ultrafiltration and inactivated with beta-propiolactone. A single dose vial containing lyophilized vaccine is reconstituted with diluent to a volume of 1.0 ml just before administration. Imovax \u0093 Rabies is manufactured and distributed by (phone 800-VAC-CINE [800-822-2463], Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Imovax\u00ae product page). b) Purified Chick Embryo Cell Culture (PCEC) - (RabAvert\u00ae) 95California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part II, Page 6 PCEC is prepared by growing the Flury LEP fixed-virus strain in primary culture of chicken embryonic fibroblasts. The virus is inactivated with beta-propiolactone, and further processed with zonal centrifugation in a sucrose density-gradient to separate the final product from media and cell culture antigens. The vaccine is then lyophilized after addition of a stabilizer solution. RabAvert \u0093 is manufactured and distributed by Bavarian Nordic (1-844-4BAVARIAN [1-844-422-8274], medical- information_US@bavarian-nordic.com). 2. Rabies Immune Globulin - Human is an antirabies gamma globulin concentrated by cold ethanol fractionation from plasma of hyperimmunized human donors. HRIG provides immediate passive immunity that endures for only a limited time (half-life of approximately 21 days). HRIG is available from and KEDRAB are supplied in 2 ml and 10 ml vials of 150 IU/mL for pediatric and adult use, respectively. HyperRAB\u00ae is a more potent product of the previously licensed HyperRABTM S/D and is supplied in 1, 3, and 5 ml vials of 300 IU/ml. All HRIG preparations are considered equally efficacious and safe when used as indicated. D. Adverse reactions to rabies immunizing products 1. Vaccine Local reactions such as pain, erythema, and swelling or itching at the injection site were reported in approximat ely 30-75 percent of patients receiving HDCV or PCEC. Mild systemic reactions such as headache, mala ise, dizziness, muscle aches, nausea, and abdominal pain have been reported in 5-50 percent of recipients. Anaphylactic, encephalitic, or neuroparalytic events have been rarely reported. 2. HRIG Local pain and tenderness at the injection site commonly occur following receipt of HRIG. A majority of recipients also experi ence mild systemic symptoms such as low- grade fever and headache. No serious adverse events such as hypersensitivity or immune complex disease have been associated with HRIG. HRIG products undergo multiple viral clearance procedures during preparation. There is no evidence that hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, or other bloodborne pathogens have ever been transmitted by commercially available HRIG in the U.S. 3. Management of adverse reactions Once initiated, rabies PEP should not be interrupted or discontinued because of local or mild systemic adverse reactions to rabies vaccine. Usually such reactions can be California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part II, Page 7 successfully managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agents (e.g., ibuprofen or acetaminophen). For more severe reactions, consideration should be given to switching to another product. When a person with a history of hypersensitivity must be given rabies vaccines, pre-medication with antihistamines may be considered; epinephrine should be readily available to counteract anaphylactic reactions, and the person should be carefully observed immediately after administration. Systemic anaphylactic or neuroparalytic reactions occurring during the administration of rabies vaccines, though rare, pose a serious dilemma for the attending physician. A patient's risk of developing rabies must be carefully considered before deciding to discontinue vaccination. The use of corticosteroids in the treatment of life-threatening neuroparalytic reactions carries the risk of inhibiting the development of active immunity to rabies. It is especially important in these cases that the patient's serum be tested for rabies antibodies following vaccination. All serious systemic, neuroparalytic, or anaphylactic reactions to a rabies vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) via a 24-hour toll-free telephone number: (800) 822-7967. 4. Precautions and contraindications a) Immunosuppression Persons with compromised immune function\u2014whether by pre-existing medical condition (e.g., neoplasia) or exogenous immunosuppressives (e.g., corticosteroids)\u2014may fail to develop complete and protective immunity after vaccination. Patients who are immunosuppressed should postpone PreEP if possible and consider avoiding activities for which rabies PreEP is indicated. Immunosuppressed persons for whom PreEP is critical should have their antibody titers checked following completion of the vaccine series. Failure to seroconvert after the third dose should be managed in consultation with appropriate public health officials. Immunosuppressive agents should not be administered during rabies PEP unless essential for the treatment of other conditions. b) Pregnancy Because of the potential consequences of inadequate treatment of a rabies exposure, pregnancy is not considered a contraindication to rabies PEP. No increased incidence of abortion, premature births, or fetal abnormalities has been associated with rabies vaccination. If the risk of exposure to rabies is substantial, PreEP might also be indicated during pregnancy. Rabies vaccine given to a nursing mother does not affect the safety of breastfeeding for either mother or infant, and breastfeeding is not a contraindication to administration of rabies vaccine. c) Antimalarials Concurrent use of antimalarial drugs may interfere with the immune response to rabies vaccination. In one study of persons undergoing PreEP with an intradermal 96California Compendium of Rabies Control and Prevention, 2012, Part II, Page 8 rabies vaccine, individuals who were concurrently taking chloroquine had a lower geometric mean titer of anti-rabies antibodies at all test points compared to persons who were not taking antimalarials. 4 Nevertheless, all study subjects had serum antibody titers that exceeded the threshold that is considered adequate for protection (complete neutralization at 1:5 on RFFIT). Data are not available as to whether this same immunosuppressive effect occurs with other antimalarial drugs or with rabies PreEP using an intramuscular vaccine. d) Allergies Persons who have a history of serious hypersensitivity to rabies vaccine should be revaccinated with caution. 5. Cost Coverage for rabies immunization, for both PreEP and PEP, varies among health insurance plans. Options are available to persons in need of PEP who are uninsured or otherwise cannot afford treatment. x Rabies vaccine (CPT Codes 90675/90676, and 90460/90461 or 90471/90472) and 90375/90376 and 96372) are covered for Medi-Cal eligible persons. Eligibility may need to be determin ed by emergency certification request at the county welfare office. x For individuals who are ineligible for Medi-Cal, have annual income at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and reside in participating counties, the cost of rabies PEP may be covered through the California County Medical Services Program. x Both rabies vaccine manufacturers have patient assistant programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients. To be eligible, patients must be indigent, uninsured, ineligible for Medicare or Medical, have household income below federal poverty level, and the attending physician must waive all fees associated with treatment. Eligibility requirements differ between companies and they should be contacted directly to discuss whether a patient is eligible for their program. Sanofi Pasteur's Indigent Patient Program (providing Imogam \u00ae Rabies-HT and Imovax\u00ae Rabies) is administered through the National Organization for Rare Disorders.
