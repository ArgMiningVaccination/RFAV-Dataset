Martin Rick J. Rasby Dennis R. Brink Ron U. Lindquist Duane H. Keisler Steve D. Kachman Mark Dragastin1 Summary A two-year study was conducted with crossbred beef cows to determine wheth - er supplementation with fat from whole corn germ either pre- or postpartum influenced ovarian activity before the breeding season, pregnancy rates, calv - ing interval, calf performance, or serum leptin concentration. Supplements were fed for approximately 45 days before or 45 days after calving. Cows supple - mented prepartum with fat from whole corn germ had shorter calving intervals. Ovarian activity before the breeding season, pregnancy rate, calf growth, and serum leptin were not different between groups. Introduction Profitability in the cow/calf sec - tor of the beef industry is driven by reproductio n . A cow must become pregnant within approximately 80 days of calving to maintain a 365-day calving interval. Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose tissue that is closely related to body condition. Cows with greater body condition have higher blood leptin concentra - tions. Leptin influences gonadotropin secretion, - ence secretion and postpartum reproduction. Supplemental feedstuffs are a necessit y in most beef cow opera - tions. When supplementing energy to beef cows, it is important to consider the possibility of negative associa - tive effects on forage digestibility. Supplemental fat or starch may inhibit fiber digestibility if fed at high levels. However, previous research indicates there is potential for moderate levels of supplemental fat to elicit a favorable reproductive response compared to control supplements equal in energy. The objectives of this study were to determine if supplementing cows with fat from whole corn germ for 45 days before or after calving affected cows exhibiting ovarian activity before the breeding season, pregnancy rate, calving interval, calf performance, or blood leptin concentrations. Procedure Composite MARC II (1/4 each Hereford, Angus, Simmental, and Gelbvieh) beef cows and cows sired by Hereford x Angus bulls and MARC II dams were used in a two-year exper - iment at the University of Nebraska- Lincol n Dalbey-Halleck experiment station. In each year cows (n=172 yr 1; n=170 yr 2) were assigned randomly to one of three treatments: control (CON; n=118) supplemented before and after calving with dry rolled corn, whole corn germ pre-calving (PRE; n=115), or whole corn germ post-calving (POST; n=109). - ments were nearly equal in CP and TDN but divergent in lipid content (Table 1); and consisted of 4 lb DM dry rolled corn or 2.5 lb DM whole corn germ supplement daily. Whole corn germ is a by-product of the wet- milling industry that contains the corn oil. Whole corn germ is approxi - mately 12.5% CP, 140% TDN, and 45% fat. Supplements were group-fed daily with at least three linear feet of bunk space per cow. Cows were fed a mixture of approximatel y one-third alfal fa hay and two-thirds bromegrass hay (as-fed basis) and were allowed ad libitum intake, such that minimal hay remaine d prior to the subsequent daily feeding. Supplementation periods aver - aged approximately 45 days, and began January 29, 2002, in year 1 and Januar y 20, 2003, in year 2. Corn germ was fed to PRE cows for 42 days from January 29 to March 11, 2002, and for 52 days from January 20 to March 12, 2003. During the period when PRE cows were supplemented with whole corn germ, CON and POST cows were managed as a single group and supplemented dry rolled corn. Whole corn germ was fed to POST cows for 42 days from March 12 to April 23, 2002 and for 50 days from March 12 to April 30, 2003. Average calving date in year 1 was March 12 + 1.4 days and in year 2 was March 20 + 1.5 d. During the period when POST cows were supplemented with whole corn germ, CON and PRE cows were fed the control supplement as a single group. From the end of the post- calvin g supplementation period to the beginning of the subsequent pre- calvin g supplementation period, cows and calves were managed together. Body weight and condition score change were used as predic - tors of nutritiona l status. Cows were weighed in January at the initiation of supplementation, in April after the supplementation period, immediately prior to the breeding season, and at Page 4 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

Weaning dates were Sep - tember 24, 2002, and October 7, 2003. Body condition scores were assigned independently by two technicians on each of these dates and between supplementation periods. Calf birth weights and weaning weights were recor d ed. Weaning weight was adjust - ed to 205 days of age. No adjustment was made for age of dam because cow ages were equally distributed across treatments. Cows were exposed to fer - tile bulls for 62 days beginning May 23rd each year. Pregnancy was diag - nosed via rectal palpation. Calving interval was calculated as the number of days between consecutive calving dates. Blood samples were taken during the treatment periods to determine leptin concentrations. Samples were cooled immediately and serum was harvested and frozen at -20\u00b0C until further analysis. Two additional blood samples were collected 10 days apart immediately prior to the breeding season to determine ovarian activ - ity. Cows with serum progesterone concentrations greater than 1 ng/mL in either sample had initiated estrous cycles. Leptin concentrations were assayed using a double-antibody radio - immunoassay validated for use in bovine serum. Results Treatment did not influence BCS nor weight at any sampling time, nor was there an effect of treatment by age interaction on BCS or weight (Table 2). Calf growth and cow reproduc - tive data are shown in Table 3. Birth weight, actual weaning weight, and weaning weight adjusted for calf age were similar among treatments. There was no difference among treatments for proportion of cows exhibiting ovarian activity prior to the breeding season or for pregnancy rate. There was a tendency ( P = 0.07) for a treat - ment effect on calving interval. PRE cows had shorter calving intervals than POST or CON cows (CON = 373 + 5.9 d, POST = 371 + 6.2 d, PRE = 362 + 5.9 d). Circulating leptin concentration was not influenced by supplement at any time during the study and aver - aged 2.15 + 0.75 ng/mL for CON, 1.88 + 0.76 ng/mL for POST, and 1.91 + 0.75 ng/mL for PRE groups. In summary, supplementing cows with whole corn germ for 45 days prior to calving reduced calving interval. Cow weight and BCS, calf growth, proportion of cows exhibiting ovarian activity prior to the start of the breeding season, and pregnancy rate were not affected. Furthermore, supplementing cows with fat did not influence leptin concentrations. 1 Jeremy Martin, graduate student; Rick Rasb y , professor, Animal Science, Lincoln; Denni s Brink, professor, Animal Science, Lincol n ; Ron Lindquist, Archer Daniels Midlan d , Columbus, Neb.; Duane Keisler, professor, Ani - mal Science, University of Va.\u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

Aaron Stalker Kelly W. Creighton Jacki A. Musgrave Don C. Adams T erry J. Klopfenstein1 Summary A two year experiment evalu - ated the influence of supplementation pre-breedin g on second - calf pregnancy rates in June - calving heifers. For 60 days before start of the breeding season, heifers were assigned to one of two treat - ments: supplementation of dried distill - ers grains (1.5 lb/day) to meet energy and metabolizable protein requirements or unsupplemented control. Supple - mentation improved body condition score during the supplementation period and resulted in increased body condi - tion score at weaning. In year 1, feeding supplement to the dam did not change calf weight gain but feeding supplement increased calf weight in year 2. Preg - nancy rates were 90% and not changed by supplementation. Introduction In the Nebraska Sandhills, calv - ing in June matches the cow =s nu- trient requirements with grazed forage nutrien t supply and reduces the need for feeding of harvested forage. Reducing the amount of harvested forage fed improves net returns compared to the traditional March - calvin g system. Reproductive performance of matur e June - calving cows is com - parable to March - calving cows but rebreeding rate of June - calving, two- year-old cows with their second calf is low ( 2000 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 13-16). Poor reproduction of young cows would negatively impact eco - nomic efficiency in the June - calving system. Nutrient status of lactating, first- calf heifers during the post -partum period has dramatic impacts on subsequent reproduction. Nutrient content of upland native range in the Nebraska Sandhills declines rapidly in late summer and early fall. Objectives of this research were to determine if supplementation to meet energy and protein requirements would improve second - calf conception rates in lac - tating, first - calf heifers when calving occur s in June. Procedure This study was conducted at the Gudmundsen Sandhills Laboratory, near Whitman, Neb., over two years. In each year, 2-year-old, primiparous, June - calving heifers (n= 41, year 1; n = 40, year 2; average calving date June 1, year 1; May 28, year 2) were stratified by calving date and assigned randomly to one of two prebreeding treatments: supplementation to meet net energy and metabolizable protein requirements or non - supplemented control. Loose dried distillers grains was used as the supplement to which an ionophore (equivalent of 150 mg/day rumensin) was added. Cows grazed upland range during the treat - ment (July 15 to August 30), breed - ing (September 1 to October 15) and post- breeding to weaning (October 16 to November) periods. In year 1 diet samples were col - lected using esophageally fistulated cows before initiation of the trial and results were used to balance diets of cows in the supplement treatment accordin g to NRC (1996) require - ments (Tables 1 and 2). At the beginning and end of the treatment period, cows and calves were weighed and body condition score of cows was determined. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, cows in the supplement treatment were group fed the daily equivalent of 1.5 lb/cow. On September 1 of each year, treatment groups were combined for the breeding season and 1.5 lb/ day supplement was fed to all cows through the end of breeding (October 15). Weaning occurred the first week of November and heifer pregnancy status was determined by rectal palpa - tion in January. Significant year by treatment inter action occurred for calf growth, therefore calf weight data are pre - sented by year. Results Heifer body weights were similar between treatments upon initiation (Continued on next page)Page 6 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved.and termination of the treatment perio d (Table 3). Body weights were similar at weaning even though heifer s in both treatments lost body weight from the end of the supple - mentation period to weaning. Heifer body condition score did not differ between treatments upon initiation of the treatment period. Heifers receiving supplement gained condition while heifers not receiv - ing supplement lost body condition during the supplementation period. Heifers in both treatments lost body condition during lactation and overall body condition score loss was not dif - ferent between treatments. In year 1, calf weight was not dif - ferent between treatments at any point during the experiment (Table 4). However, in year 2, calves nursing dams fed supplement were heavier at the end of the supplementation period and tended to be heavier at wean - ing. This discrepancy in calf growth between years may result from differ - ences in forage quality dynamics. Dried distillers grains are high in undegraded intake protein. Past research has shown an increase in milk production in cows fed protein supplements containing undegraded intake protein. The increase in milk production in response to undegraded intake protein supplementation is variable and appears to interact with nutrient plane (i.e. forage quality). It is possible that forage quality differ -T able 3.

Adams T erry J. Klopfenstein Rick N. Funston1 Summary Crossbred, spring calving cows were used in a three-year experiment to evaluate the influence of supplemen - tal protein prepartum and grazing sub-irrigate d meadow postpartum on pregnancy rates and calf feedlot performance. Feeding supplement prepartum improved body condition score pre - calvin g and pre - breeding and increased the percentage of live calves at weaning but did not affect pregnancy rate or steer calf feedlot performance. Grazing sub - irrigated meadow did not change pregnancy rates or feedlot per - formance. Introduction Beef production systems are com - prised of a series of segments with potential for complex interactions. Management changes in one segment may influence the entire system. Body condition score is a good measure of energy reserves and BCS at calving is among the most important factors affecting pregnancy rate. How - ever, postpartum nutrition also may influence reproduction. Increased nutritional plane both pre - and post - partum has been shown to increase growth rate of calves in many but not all cases. Whether this increased growth rate persists beyond weaning is not known. Objectives of this study were to determine the effects of pre - and postpartum nutrition and their inter - action within an applied production setting on productivity of the entire system, especially cow reproductive performance and calf growth perfor - mance through the feedlot.Procedure In year 1, 136 pregnant, MARC II (four - breed composite:1/4 Angus, 1/4 Gelbvieh, 1/4 Hereford, 1/4 Sim - mental), spring calving cows age 3 to 5 years were stratified by age and weaning weight of previous calf then assigned randomly to 1) supplement or no supplement prepartum and 2) sub- irrigated meadow or hay postpar - tum. In year 2 cows were switched to the opposite treatment and switched back to their original treatment in year 3. Cows remained in the experi - ment unless removed because of injur y , reproductive failure, or if calv - ing did not occur by April 20 (Table 1). In year 2 and 3 only 113 cows were used because of reduced forage avail - ability caused by drought. On December 1, cows were divided into eight pastures of similar size and grazed native upland range at the University of Nebraska, Gudmundsen Sandhills Laboratory, near Whitman, Neb. Either 0 or 1 lb daily of supple - ment was provided to cows on a pas - ture basis, three times per week, from December 1 to February 28. On a DM basis, supplement ingredients were: 50.0% sunflower meal, 47.9% cot and 73.3% TDN. Cows were managed in a com - mon group during the calving season (March 1 to April 30) and fed grass hay in a dry lot. Amount of hay fed was adjusted daily in an effort to sat - isfy appetite but minimize waste and averaged 30.9 lb/cow daily (DM basis). Hay quality was determined by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy at a commercial laboratory (Table 2). Averag e calving date was March 27. During the period between calving and start of breeding (May 1 to May 31), half the cows were fed grass hay and half grazed sub - irrigated meadow. At the beginning of breeding season (June 1) treatment groups were com - bined and cows grazed upland range as a single group for the remainder of the production cycle. The breeding season lasted 60 days with a 1:20 bull: cow ratio. Diet quality (Table 2) was estimated from masticate samples obtained from esophageally fistulated cows. Weight and body condition score (BCS) of all cows were recorded at beginning (December 1) and end (February 28) of the prepartum supplementation period, at beginning (May 1) and end (May 30) of the post - partum meadow grazing period, and at weaning (first week of October). Cows were examined for pregnancy via rectal palpation by a veterinarian in October. Calves were weighed within 24 to 48 hours of birth and at weaning. Between 24 and 48 hours of birth, a blood sample was collected from (Continued on next page)T able 1. Causes for cows being removed from study.

After the 7 - day adaptation period, steers were weighed on two consecutive days and implanted with Synovex S and dewormed with Cydectin on the second day. Steers were reimplanted with Revelar S about 100 days prior to slaughter. The starting diet contained 35% alfalfa and steers were adapted over 14 days to a finishing diet that contained 48% dry rolled corn, 40% wet corn gluten feed, 7% alfalfa and 5% supplement (DM basis) by replac - ing alfalfa with corn. Steers were fed in 8 pens corresponding to the pre - partum pasture of their dam until it was visually estimated the average 12th rib back fat of all steers was 0.5 in. Hot carcass weight was obtained at harvest. Dressing percentage was calculated using the unshrunk weight obtained at the feedlot prior to ship - ment to the abattoir. Following a 24-hour chill, marbling score, fat thickness at the 12th rib, percentage of KPH, longissimus muscle area, yield grade and quality grade were determined. Results Cows fed protein supplement prepartu m had greater BCS at the end of the supplementation period (P < 0.001), at start of postpartum treatment period ( P < 0.001) and at start of the breeding season ( P = 0.01) than cows not fed supplement (Table 3). Feeding supplemental protein did not result in increased pregnancy rates ( P = 0.46). Similarly, cows that grazed sub - irrigated meadow had greater BCS ( P < 0.001) at start of breeding but pregnancy rates were not affected ( P = 0.88). It is likely that pregnancy rates were similar because nonsupplemented and hay fed cows were in acceptable body condition at calving and at start of breeding. Research has shown a BCS of 5 at calving is the critical level affecting subsequent reproduction and cows in all treatments were near a BCS of 5 at calving. Cows fed supplement calved three days later ( P = 0.01) than cows not fed supplement but birth weight was similar ( P = 0.29). Weaning weight and ADG from birth to weaning were greater for calves born to cows fed supplement. Several studies report increase d weaning weight of calves born to cows fed supplement prepar - tum. The percentage of live calves at weaning was greater ( P = 0.03) for cows fed supplement prepartum but was not different ( P = 0.56) between cows that grazed meadow or were fed hay (Table 3). Since only pregnant cows were included in the study each year, differences in percentage of live calves at weaning cannot be attributed to failure to conceive. Potentially, failure of passive transfer of immunity could explain differences in weaning rate and weaning weight. In year 2 and 3, IgG titers of calves between 24 and 48 hours after birth were similar (P = 0.98; Table 4). These results agree with the finding that BCS at calving, ranging from 4 to 7, does not influ - ence IgG titers of calves. Steers born to cows fed supplement prepartum that grazed subirrigated meadow were heavier ( P < 0.05) upon entry into the feedlot than steers born to cows in the other treatment combi - nations (Table 5).

Likewise, feedlot ADG (P = 0.45), DMI ( P = 0.71), feed ef - ficiency ( P = 0.71) and carcass weight (P = 0.67) were similar for steers born to cows that grazed meadow and cows fed hay. Carcass characteristics were not influenced by either prepartum or postpartum treatment. Implications Results of this study indicate feed - ing supplement to spring calving cows grazing dormant forage may have benefits beyond impacting reproduc - tion. Feeding supplement to spring calving cows did not improve preg - nancy rates but increased percentage of live calves at weaning. These data demonstrate that changes in manage - ment have ramifications beyond the segment in which they occur and may influence the entire production system. In this study, prepartum nutrition had a greater affect on sub - sequent productivity than did post - partum nutrition. 1Aaron Stalker, graduate student; Don Ad - ams, professor, Animal Science;Rick Funston, associate professor, Animal Science, West Central Research and Extension Center, North Platte; T erry Klopfenstein, professor, Animal Science, Lincoln.T able 4.

The effects of dam nutrition dur - ing late gestation and early life on futur e performance of their heifer calves are not well characterized. Therefore, the objectives of the cur - rent study were to determine if supplemental protein during late ges - tation or postpartum plane of nutri - tion of cows influences future growth or reproductive performance of their heifer calves. Procedure A 3-year study was conducted with heifers produced at Gudmunsen Sandhills Laboratory (GSL), Whit - man, Neb. The heifers were born to cows used in a 2x2 factorial treatment design to determine effects of late gestation and postpartum nutrition on reproductive performance and calf growth ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Report , pp 7-9). During the last trimester of gestation (December 1 through February 28) cows received either the equivalent of 1 lb/head/day of a 42% CP supplement fed three times per week or no protein supplement. The cows were managed as a single group during the calving season, March 1 to April 30. From May 1 until May 31, half the cows were fed cool-seaso n grass hay while the other half grazed sub-irrigated meadow. On June 1, cows were again combined and were managed in a common group throughout the breeding season and remainder of the production cycle. During year 1 and year 3, heifers were managed as a single group from June 1 until the end of data collec - tion. Data available from year 1 is limited to birth and weaning records. In year 2, additional reproduction and calving data was collected. The proportion of heifers cycling before the beginning of the breeding season in year 2 was determined by proges - terone concentration in two blood samples collected 10 days apart. Pro - gesterone concentration greater than 1 ng/mL in either sample was inter - preted to indica t e ovarian luteal activ - ity. Heifers from year 2 were expose d to bulls for breeding, and first service pregnancy rate was determine using transrectal ultrasonography approxi - mately 30 days after the end of the breeding season. Heifers born in year 3 remained at GSL for 109 days after weaning and were then transported to the North Dakota State University Animal Nutritio n and Physiology Center, Fargo, ND. After an adaptation and training period, heifers from year 3 were individually fed for 84 days usin g Calan gates. Heifers were housed in a climate-controlled facility with the light cycle being 14 hours light, 10 hours dark. All heifers were allowed ad libitum consumption of hay (7.5% CP, 71% NDF, 52 % ADF) fed in the and supplemented daily with 2 lb of 16% CP pellets in the after - noon. Orts were collected twice week - ly and analyzed for DM to determine DMI. Two-day consecutive weights were taken at the beginning and end of the feeding period, with interim weights recorded every 14 d. Follow - ing completion of the individual feed - ing period on May 17, 2005, heifers were transported to the West Central Research and Extension Center, North Platte, Neb. and pre-breeding weights were recorded. Performance data were analyzed as a 2x2 factorial using PROC MIXED of SAS. Reproductive and calving difficulty data were analyzed usin g Chi-square procedures in PROC GENMOD of SAS.

Adams Rick N. Funston1 Summary A 3-year experiment evaluated the effects of maternal nutrition on growth and reproductive performance of heifer calves. Supplementing cows with protein during late gestation resulted in heifers that were heavier at weaning and breed - ing, had higher pregnancy rates, and calved earlier. Allowing cows to graze meadows after calving improved calf weaning weight but not heifer reproduc - tive performance. Heifers from cows that were fed hay after calving had reduced DMI and improved residual feed intake if their dams were supplemented with protein during gestation, but ADG and G:F were not affected by dam supple - mentation or spring feeding strategies. Introduction The nutritional requirements of spring-calving beef cows grazing dor - mant Sandhills range during late ges - tation exceed the nutritional value of the forage. In order to maintain cow body condition, protein supplements are often fed during the last trimester of gestation. These supplements are expensive and do not improve sub - sequent reproductive performance (2005 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 7-9). However, the additional cost of pro - tein supplementation is recovered in improved calf performance at weaning and feedlot endpoints ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 7-9). Addi - tionally, nutrient requirements of the cow are highest during early lactation, which coincides with the beginning of the breeding season.

Pen was included in the random state - ment for heifers in the individual feeding trial. For year 3, residual feed intake (RFI) was calculated by regressing DMI on mid-test weight and ADG using PROC REG of SAS. The slope coefficients (bm and bg, respectively) from these analyses were then used to predict DMI using the following equation: Predicted DMI = Averag e DMI of the group + bm(mid-test weight) + bg(ADG). Residual feed intake was calculated as the differ - ence between observed and predicted DMI; therefore, lower values indicate increased efficiency. Results Birth and weaning data are sum - marized in Table 1. Dam nutrition did not affect ( P > 0.10) heifer birth date or birth weight. Supplementing cows with protein during late gesta - tion tended ( P = 0.14) to increase subsequent heifer weaning weight, and increased ( P = 0.02) adjusted 205 day weight. Cows that grazed sub-irrigate d meadows during the spring produced heifer calves with increased actual ( P = 0.09) and adjuste d (P = 0.07) weaning weight compared to heifers from cows fed hay. Pre-breedin g weight was greater (P = 0.04) for heifers from protein- supplemented dams than heifers from unsupplemented dams, but spring treatmen t did not affect ( P > 0.10) heifer pre - breeding weight. Overall ADG betwee n weaning and the first breeding season was not affected by dam treatment ( P > 0.10; data not shown). There was no effect ( P > 0.10) of dam nutrition on the proportion of heifers from year 2 exhibiting ovarian luteal activity prior to the breeding season (Table 2). Furthermore, there was no difference ( P > 0.10) for preg - nancy rates or calving data betwee n heifers whose dams grazed sub- irrigate d meadows and heifers whose T able 1.

However, first service pregnancy rate was 88% for heifers from protein- supplemented dams and 45% for heifers born to unsupplemented cows (P = 0.003). Overall pregnancy rate was 94% versus 73% ( P = 0.06) for heifers from or unsupplemented dams, respectively. Heifers born to cows supplemented with protein during late gestation calved earlier ( P = 0.07; Table 2) and had a greater proportion of unas - sisted births (69% vs 38%; P = 0.08) than heifers whose dams were not supplemented with protein during late gestation. However, no differences ( P = 0.61) in birth weight were detected. Weight and BCS prior to the second breeding season were not affected by maternal nutrition ( P > 0.10; data not shown). Data from the individual feeding trial (yr 3) are presented as simple effect s (Table 3). Heifers from pro - tein-supplemented cows were heavier (P = 0.08) at the end of the 84-day trial but had similar initial weights (P > 0.10), and similar BCS at both time points ( P > 0.10) compared to heifers from cows that were not supplemented during gestation. Dam nutrition after calving did not affect weight nor BCS ( P > 0.10). Neither ADG nor the ratio of gain to feed was affected ( P > 0.10) by maternal nutri - tion.Dry matter intake and RFI were affecte d (P = 0.09, P = 0.07, respec - tively) by the interaction of maternal nutrition during late gestation and after the calving season. Heifers born to protein supplemented dams had greater DMI ( P = 0.09) if their dams were fed hay in the spring, but not if their dams grazed meadows after calving ( P > 0.10). Similarly, heifers from protein supplemented dams had higher RFI ( P = 0.07) if their dams were fed hay in the spring, but not if their dams grazed meadows during the postpartum period ( P > 0.10) . Higher RFI values indicate that heifer s from protein supplemented cows fed hay were less feed efficient than heifer s from unsupplemented cows fed hay after calving. In this data set, it appear s that selecting for feed efficienc y based on RFI would result in reduced DMI, but not improved ADG. In fact, the heifers with more favorable RFI also had numerically lower ADG, but the differences were not statistically significant. Gain to feed ratio was not affected by treat - ment. Conclusion Supplementing cows with protein during late gestation not only affects the nutritional plane of the cow, but has lasting effects on their heifer calf weight and reproductive performance. Heifers from protein-supplemented cows were heavier at weaning and maintained this advantage through the beginning of the breeding season, but postweaning rate of gain was similar. These same heifers tended to have higher pregnancy rates, calved earlier, and had a higher proportion of unassisted births. Cows grazing sub- irrigate d meadows also weaned heavi - er calves but this weight advantage was not maintained, and reproductive performance of the heifers was not improved. In young cattle, RFI is a measure of feed efficiency correlated to reduced mature cow feed intake but not mature cow size (Arthur et al, 2004 J. Anim. Sci. Suppl. 1:449). Heifers from cows receiving protein supplement during gestation that were fed hay after calving had more favor - able RFI and reduced DMI, although G:F was not influenced by maternal nutrition. 1Jeremy Martin, graduate student; Kim Vonnahme, assistant professor, Animal Science, North Dakota State University, Fargo, N.D.; Greg Lardy, professor, Animal Science, North Dakota State University, Fargo, N.D.; Don Adams, pro - fessor, Animal Science, West Central Research and Extension Center, North Platte; Rick Fun - ston, assistant professor, Animal Science, West Central Research and Extension Center, North Platte.\u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved. 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 13 (Continued on next page)A System for Wintering Beef Heifers Using Dried Distillers Grains We hypothesized dried distillers grains (DDG) would be an acceptable supplement in an extended grazing heifer wintering system. The nutri - ent profile of DDG makes it attractive in forage based production settings. Dried distillers grains is an excellent source of total digestible nutrients, containing digestible fiber and rela - tively high levels of fat. Dried distillers grains is also high in crude protein (approximately 32%), the major - ity of which (65%) is undegraded in the rumen. Additionally, DDG is a good source of phosphorus (0.6%), a nutrien t commonly deficient in forage based diets. The objective of this experiment was to reduce costs in an extended grazing heifer wintering system us - ing a DDG based supplement without decreasing heifer reproductive or calf growth performance compared to a conventional system. Procedure Spring - calving, crossbred heifers (n = 657, yr 1; n = 696, yr 2) were used in a two - year experiment at a co m mer - cial ranch (Rex Ranch, Abbott Unit) near Ashby, Neb. In August of each year (Aug. 21 yr 1; Aug. 26 yr 2) preg - nant heifers were assigned randomly to control or treatment systems. The standard system used by the ranch for wintering pregnant heifers served as control and included access to native upland range, dry corn gluten based supplement (Table 1), and meadow hay. Hay feeding in the CON system began in December and amount fed increased as gestation advanced such that hay completely replaced range as calving approached. The treatment system included access to native range and a DDG based supplement with no hay fed. In the TRT system heifers had ad libitum access to native upland range for the entire treatment period.Systems were designed to sup - ply similar amounts of energy and meet degraded intake protein and metabolizable protein requirements. Data collected from previous research (2004 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 7 - 9) served as a guide for predicting for - age intake. Predicted forage intake, changes in forage quality and historic hay feeding records were used as input s into the NRC (1996) model to create a supplement feeding schedule. Supplement feeding schedules (Table 2) were designed to begin in October of each year but actual starting dates were at the discretion of the ranch manager and depended on weather and forage availability. Supplement feeding was terminated at onset of calving. Average calving date was March 22. Upon termination of treat - ments, heifers were managed in a common group during calving and the subsequent summer grazing sea - son. Heifer weight and body condition score (scale 1= emaciated, 9 = obese), evaluated independently by two tech - nicians, were recorded upon initia - tion of the experiment (August 21 year 1; August 26 year 2), termination of treatments (February 26, year 1; March 1, year 2), and the subsequent fall (October 14, year 1). Calves born to heifers following application of treatments were weighed at birth and L. Aaron Stalker Don C. Adams T erry J. Klopfenstein1 Summary A two - year experiment compared two systems for wintering pregnant heifer s . The standard system used by the ranch served as the control (CON) and the treatment system (TRT) included a dried distillers grains based supple - ment. Heifers in the TRT system were heavier and had greater body condition score at end of supplementation. Calv - ing difficulty, percentage of live calves weaned and subsequent pregnancy rate were similar between systems. Calves born to heifers in the TRT system were heavier at birth and weaning. The TRT system cost $10.47/heifer less than the CON system and resulted in equivalent or improved heifer and calf growth per - formance. Introduction Purchased and harvested feeds represent a major component of the annual operating costs in cow - calf operations. Mechanically harvesting and feeding of forage is expensive and significant improvements in economic efficiency may be gained by extend - ing the grazing season ( 2001 Nebraska Beef Report , pp.10 - 12). However, effectiv e supplementation programs are require d if optimal animal perfor - mance is to be achieved in extended grazing production systems. Previous research has demon - strat ed the value of meeting animal nutr i ent requirements in extended grazing heifer wintering systems (2004 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 7 - 9). This study showed feeding a dry corn gluten feed based supplement in an extended grazing system reduced win - ter costs by $6.91 compared to a con - ventional wintering system dependent upon hay feeding.T able 1.

To evalu - ate carry over effects of treatments on subsequent pregnancy rate, heifers were examined for pregnancy by rec - tal palpation in the fall (October 14, year 1). The second year of this study is still in progress; therefore, weaning weight of calves and fall weight and BCS of heifers from year 2 are not included. Diet quality was estimated at the beginning, middle and end of the treatment period in both systems (Table 3) from masticate samples obtaine d from esophageally fistulated cows external to the experiment. Costs associated with both sys - tems in year 2 were compared using partial budget analysis. Costs from year 2 were used because management in year 1 did not closely match the prescribed feeding schedule. Actual amount of hay and supplement fed was used in the budget. Amount of grazed forage consumed was calcu - lated from intake predictions. Hay was valued using a 10-year average price (Crop and Livestock Prices for Nebraska Producers, 2005) and winter range valued at half the current aver - age rate for a summer AUM, accord - ing to published data (Nebraska Farm Real Estate Market Developments, 2003 - 2004), while actual purchase price of supplements was used in the budget. Labor costs associated with feeding were obtained from historic ranch records. Results Body weight ( P < 0.001) and BCS (P < 0.001) were greater at the end of the supplementation period for heifers in the TRT system (Table 4). This was because ADG ( P < 0.001) was greater and less BCS ( P = 0.03) was lost for heifers in the TRT system. Systems were designed to result in similar performance. Heifers in the TRT sys - tem performed similarly to designed objectives. Observed differences be - tween systems may be a result of devi - ations by the ranch manager from the prescribed feeding schedule for CON heifers and because forage and hay quality were different than predicted T able 2.

Analysis of costs associated with wintering heifers in both systems indicate d costs were reduced by $10.47/heifer in the TRT system (Table 5). Hay and labor associated with feeding hay comprised nearly 41% of costs in the CON system. Grazed forage was the major cost in the TRT system. Labor costs account for approximately half the difference in costs between the two systems. On cow/calf operations were labor could be devoted to other enterprises the TRT system may be more attractive compared to operations were labor is not limiting. Conclusion These results indicate extended grazing systems for wintering preg - nant heifers can result in reduced costs without sacrificing heifer and calf performance. Opportunity exists to incorporate by-products from corn milling into forage based production systems as a method of reducing costs. 1Aaron Stalker, graduate student; Don Adam s , professor, Animal Science, West Central Research and Extension Center, North Platte; T erry Klopfenstein, professor, Animal Science, Lincoln.Table 5.

During the interval between end of supplementation and pregnancy determination, heifers in the CON system gained more weight ( P < 0.001) than heifers in the TRT system. However, weight gain from initia - tion of treatments to the following Octobe r was greater ( P = 0.003) for TRT Calving date ( P = 0.68) was not affecte d by system.

Actual weight ( P = 0.07) and ADG (P = 0.06) of calves tended to be greater and weaning weight adjusted to 205 d of age was greater ( P = 0.03) for calves born to heifers in the TRT system. Several studies have shown an increase in weaning weight of calves born to cows in better nutrient status during gestation ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 7 - 9). These results sug - gest the increased weight may persist beyon d weaning.

In contrast, if MGA caused decrease d testis weight or scrotal cir - cumference then this may decrease testosterone production which would be beneficial to producers that cas - trate bulls later in age. Testosterone has positive effects on increased lean muscle growth. However, testosterone also induces aggressive male behav - ior, and causes off flavor in carcasses (especially in intact males). Therefore, a reduction in testosterone produc - tion may provide the benefits of lean muscle growth while reducing the unfavorable effects associated with behavior and meat flavor. Procedure Experiment 1 Prepubertal Bull calves were given a supple - ment of 56% soybean hulls, 40 % fine ground corn at 6 lbs/hd/day either containing MGA (1 mg/hd/day, n=12) or without MGA (n=11) while on a roughage diet from 5.5 to 8.5 months. The roughage diet included pasture, containing smooth brome grasses, during the summer months and alfalf a hay fed ad libitum during the winter months. Blood samples, scro - tal circumference and body weight were collected at 7.5, 8.75, 9.5, and 11 months. In addition, two bulls were castrated at each collection time to determine individual testis weight and combined testis weight. Blood samples were evaluated for LH and testosterone concentrations (Figure 1). Data were analyzed using SAS with repeated measures and weaning weight as a covariate. Experiment 2 Peri-pubertal Bull calves were given a supple - ment of 56% soybean hulls, 40 % fine ground corn at 6 lbs/hd/day either containing MGA (1 mg/hd/day, n=12) or without MGA (n=10) while on a roughage diet from 6.5 to 9.5 mo. The roughage diet included pasture, containing smooth brome grasses, during the summer months and al - falfa hay fed ad libitum during the winter months. Blood samples, scrotal circumference and body weight were collected at 9.5, 10.5, 11.5, and 12.5 months. In addition, at least two bulls were castrated at each collection time to determine individual testis weight and combined testis weight.

McFee Rebecca C. Bott Joseph S. Schulz T. Clopton Jeffrey W. Bergman Karl V . Moline Kathryn J. Hanford Andrea S. Cupp1 Summary Melengestrol acetate (MGA), which is commonly used in the beef industry to manipulate ovarian activity of females, was fed to bulls at two times during development, prepubertal (5.5 to 7.5 months) and peri-pubertal (6.5 to 9.5 months), to determine effects on testes size, scrotal circumference, body weight, and/or hormone production. We can conclude that feeding bulls MGA during the prepubertal and peri-pubertal time can alter body weight and testosterone production. Introduction Previous studies feeding bulls 0.5 to 2.0 mg/hd/day MGA at 317 days of age for 99 days resulted in no effects on LH or testosterone concentrations or male sexual behavior. However, no experiments have determined the effects of feeding MGA prior to 9 months on testis function in bulls. In the current study MGA was fed at two critical times during development; 1) prepubertal (5.5 to 7.5 months) and; 2) peri-pubertal (6.5 to 9.5 months), to determine the effects on testes size and hormone concentration in bulls. If MGA caused an increase in either testes weight or scrotal cir - cumference this should result in an increase in sperm production. Bulls with increased sperm production would be beneficial to those in the cattle industry raising seedstock or purebred bulls for natural mating 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Figure 1.Prepubertal Serial Castrations/Collections MGAAge (month) 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Figure 2.Peri-pubertal Serial Castrations/Collections Age (month) MGA\u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved. 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 17 Results Experiment 1 Prepubertal MGA treated bulls were lighter than control bulls ( P < 0.05) at col - lection 3 (9.5 mo; Table 1). There was also a tendency ( P = 0.1) at collection 3 for testosterone concentration to be lower in the MGA treated than control group (9.5 months; Table 1). Testis weight, combined testes weight, and scrotal circumference were not different between the treatment and control groups. Histological sections from bulls at each castration collec - tion are being evaluated to determine the effects of MGA prior to puberty on testis composition. Experiment 2 Peri-pubertal Control bulls were heavier ( P < 0.05) than MGA treated bulls at col - lection 3 (11.5 mo; Table 2). Testis weight, combined testis weight, and scrotal circumference were not sta - tistically different between the two groups (Table 2). Further analysis of histology from testes from both experiments will determine if MGA treatments affected populations of cells within the testis or sperm matu - ration. From these experiments, we can conclude that feeding MGA during the pre- and peri-pubertal period can alter testosterone production and body weight. Thus, feeding MGA during different stages of bull devel - opment may be good method to alter testis function.

Bott Karl V . Moline Jeff W. Bergman Andrea S. Cupp1 Summary Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is produced by cells surround - ing the egg in the follicle prior to ovula - tion. If VEGF is inhibited, ovulation does not occur. The VEGF gene can be spliced to produce different protein iso - forms which have specific functions. Our objective was to determine if VEGF 120 and 164 mRNA isoforms are differen - tially regulated in licle. From our studies, VEGF isoforms are differentially regulated during both CL regression and after a simulated LH surge. Differences observed in VEGF iso - form regulation may allow for manipu - lation of ovulation in the beef cow. Introduction Follicular development within the bovine ovary is a dynamic process. It begins prior to birth and continues throughout the cow =s reproductive lifespan. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is crucial in the ovulatory follicle. The blood vessels supply the follicle with necessary nu - trients for development and growth prior to ovulation. VEGF is expressed by granulosa cells (cells surrounding the egg) prior to ovulation in the bo - vine follicle and is an important factor in the regulation of normal angiogen - esis in the developing follicle and cor - pus luteum. Several VEGF isoforms exist, the most common isoforms are VEGF 164 and VEGF 120. In other tis - sues such as the heart and lung VEGF isoforms have specific functions in vascular development. VEGF 120 is highly diffusible and recruits endo -thelial cells (precursor to blood vessel cells) in the establishment of blood vessels. VEGF 164 recruits endothelial cells that form the large blood ves - sels. However, it is not known how these isoforms function in the ovarian preovulatory follicle nor how inhibi - tion of VEGF might alter ovulation. The objective of the current study is to determine if the two major VEGF mRNA isoforms, 120 and 164, are differentially regulated prior to ovu - lation in the granulosa cells of the dominant follicle. Procedure Trial 1 Two injections of PGF2a (5mg/cow) were administered 14 days apart. PGF2a induces regression of the cor - pus luteum initiating the LH surge and ovulation. A vaginal probe with needle attachment was used to collect follicular fluid and granulosa cells from the dominant follicle. Follicular aspirates were collected at 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 54, 60, 66, and 72 hours (n=average of 8) after the second injectio n of PGF2a. Messenger RNA was extracted from granulosa cells and samples were reversed transcribed to cDNA. Progesterone and estrogen concentrations were measured in fol - licular fluid. A ratio greater than 1 of estrogen to progesterone indicated that the follicle was still dominant. The mRNA expression of VEGF iso - forms 120 and 164 were determined using real-time quantitative poly - merase chain reaction (PCR) at each follicular aspirate time point. Data were analyzed using an ANOVA with SAS. Comparisons of means were analyzed using a Tukey-Kramer test. In 12 animals, blood samples were collected after the second injection of PGF2a at two-hour intervals from 0 to 72 hours to determine when the LH surge occurred. The LH surge was detected in six of the 12 cows and occurre d between 54 and 72 hours. Due to this variation, a second trial was conducted to obtain follicle aspi - rates after a simulated surge of LH by injecting GnRH (0.1mg/cow). Trial 2 Two injections of PGF2a (5mg/cow) were administered 14 days apart with an injection of GnRH (0.1mg/cow) administered 48 hours after the sec - ond injection of PGF2a. Follicular aspirates were collected via vaginal probe with needle attachment at 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after GnRH (n=average of 3). Messenger RNA was extracted as described previously and expression of VEGF mRNA isoforms 120 and 164 were analyzed using quantitative real time PCR. Data were analyzed using an ANOVA with SAS. Comparisons of means were tested us - ing a Tukey-Kramer test. VEGF Isoforms/GapDH2 1.5 1 0.5 12 18 24 30 36 48 54 60 66 72 Hours after PGVEGF 120 VEGF 164 b,c aa,bb b,c ab,c Figure 1.

In the 12 cows bled to determine timing of the LH surge, 50% of the cows had an LH surge between 54 and 72 hours (Figure 2). In the other half of the cows, the LH surge did not oc - cur within the 72-hour time period and presumably had occurred after 72 hours (Figure 3). Due to this variation in occurrence of the LH surge, data collected after the 54-hour time point was deemed not representative of all cows in the study. Luteinizing hor - mone has been shown to affect VEGF mRNA expression, therefore cows that had LH surges would have differ - ent VEGF mRNA expression profiles when compared to cows that did not have an LH surge at the 54 to 72 hour period. Thus a second trial was con - ducted to more accurately synchronize the LH surge by an injection with GnRH to determine how the LH surge would affect VEGF mRNA isoforms. In trial 2, an increase in VEGF 120 mRNA expression ( P < 0.05) was detected at 3 hours post GnRH (Fig - ure 4). VEGF 120 is responsible for recruiting endothelial cells to develop initial blood vessels. The increase in VEGF 120 mRNA at 3 hours may represent recruitment of endothelial cells to develop blood vessels in the developing corpus luteum. There was no difference in VEGF 164 at any of the collections after GnRH. Thus, it appears that VEGF 164 and 120 iso - forms maybe independently regulated at corpus luteum regression (trial #1) and after the LH surge (trial #2). De - termining the role of VEGF isoforms during the preovulatory period may allow for better 1) synchronization of ovulation for timed-AI; and 2) corpus luteum formation which may reduce embryonic mortality in beef cattle. 1Robin A.

Syn - thetic progestins, such as MGA, also have been used to induce cyclic activ - ity in heifers and mature cows and to synchronize estrous cycles. Therefore, the objectives of this experiment were to determine if bull exposure and a 7-day MGA feeding period would in - crease conception rates, compared to cows administered MGA without bull exposure. Procedure The objectives of the followin g experiments were to determine the effects of bull exposure and/or 7- day MGA treatment on the follow - ing variables 1) percentage cycling at the beginnin g of the trial (first blood sample taken approximately 60 days before breeding); 2) percentage cyclin g at the time of synchroniza - tion; 3) calving to initiation of cyclic activity; 4) percentage conceived to TAI; and 5) final pregnancy rate. In a 2002 trial, cows were exposed (n= 88) or not exposed (n= 97) to surgically sterilized bulls (epididyec - tomized) at least 30 days prior to breeding at a bull to cow ratio of 1:20 (Figure 1). Blood samples were taken at four different time points before the synchronization protocol was initiated. Progesterone assays were analyzed and a female was considered cycling if serum progesterone concen - tration was at least 1 ng/ml or greater at blood collection. The females were given a PGF2a injection (5 mg/cow) before starting on a 7-day treatment of MGA (.5 mg/kg/day). After the MGA feeding period, the cows were again injected with prostaglandin (5 mg/cow). The females were artificially inseminated 70 hours after the second prostaglandin injection (Figure 1). Fertile bulls were placed with cows two weeks after TAI. In a second trial, which was con - ducted over two years (2003-2004), a similar procedure was followed. Cows were allotted to bull exposed (n= 170) or non-bull exposed (n=176) groups and bled at regular intervals to deter - mine cyclicity. Cows in the bull expo - sure group were exposed to sterile bull (epididyectomized but has libido) for at least 30 days prior to breeding at a bull to cow ratio of 1:20 (Figure 2). In this trial, cows were given an injec - tion of GnRH (0.1 mg) before a 7-day MGA treatment. On the last day of MGA treatment, the cows were given an injection of PGF2a and artificially inseminated 55 to 60 hours after the PGF2a injection (Figure 2). Fertile bulls were placed with cows two weeks after TAI. All data were analyzed us - ing SAS. Effects of treatment were de - termined with a one-way ANOVA and treatment means were analyzed using a Dunnett =s test. Percentage of cows Michelle M. Baltes Rebecca C. Bott Ryann M. McFee Joseph S. Schulz Candice F oombs Jeff W. Bergman Karl V . Moline Andrea S. Cupp1 Summary The purpose of the current experi - ments was to determine if cows exposed to sterile bulls (epididyectomized) in combination with a 7-day MGA treat - ment would have an advantage in conception rates to cows not exposed to bulls. Bull exposure increase d percentage of cows cycling prior to synchronization and reduced the time from calving to initiation of cyclin g . Overall there was not an increas e in conception rates to timed TAI or in total pregnancy rates in bull exposed MGA treated cows when compared to cows not exposed to bulls. Introduction Shortening the postpartum inter - val for beef cows has been a difficult task for cattle producers. Although the scientific explanation is not clear, researchers have demonstrated bull exposure may reduce the postpartum anestrous interval. Cows that have been exposed to bulls early in the Figure 1.

Results Trial 1 In the first trial there were more mature cows and second-calf cows cyclin g after bull exposure (Table 1; P < 0.05) compared to cows not expose d to bulls. However, there were greater numbers of second-calf cows cycling before initiation of the experiment in the bull exposed group compared to the non-exposed group. Calving to initiation of cyclic activity was reduced in the second-calf cows exposed to bulls (71 days) compared to the non-bull exposed group (85 days; Table 1; P < 0.05). There were no effects of treatment on percentage conceived to TAI or final pregnancy rates. Trial 2 In 2003, 36.8% of second-calf cows exposed to bulls were cycling after bull exposure compared to the non- bull exposed (5.6%; Table 2; P < 0.05). The second-calf cows exposed to bulls had reduced calving to initiation of cyclic activity (92 days) compared to the non-bull exposed (112 days; Table 2; P < 0.05). The mature cows exposed to bulls had a significant increase in the percentage of females that con - ceived to TAI (46.0 %) compared to the non-bull exposed females (26.4%; Table 2; P < 0.05) but this was not repeated as significant in the second year.

The second-calf cows exposed to bulls had a reduced calving to initiation of cyclic activity (68 days) compared to the non-bull exposed (85 days; Table 3; P < 0.05). The second-calf cows exposed to bulls also had a higher rate of pregnancy (95.0%) compared to the control (76.2%). Mature cows expose d to bulls had a reduced calving to initi - ation of cycling (52 days) compared to non-bull exposed (61 days). Interest - ingly, the bull exposed mature cows had a lower final pregnancy rate com - pared to the non-bull exposed mature cows (Table 3; P < 0.05). In conclusion, bull exposure in combination with a 7-day MGA feed - ing period does not consistently en - hance conception rates to TAI or total pregnancy rates compared to cows treated for 7 days with MGA. The year to year differences may be due to body condition scores of cows in the herd prior to breeding. However, it does appear that the comb i nation of a 7-day MGA administration with a GnRH injection on day 1 and PGF2a on day 7 and TAI at 55 to 60 hours is a viable synchronizatio n protocol to obtai n 40-50% conception rates to TAI in cows of all ages. 1Michelle M.

Procedure In the first experiment, meadow and range samples from a previous study ( 2002 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 7-9) were further analyzed to de - termine the UIP content, UIPDIG, and total tract indigestible dietary protein (TTIDP). In the previous study, forage samples were collected from two subirrigated meadow sites and two upland native range sites at the Gudmunsen Sandhills Labora - tory near Whitman, Neb. Subirrigated meadow samples consisted of warm and cool-season grasses and upland native range samples consisted of warm season grasses. Collections were made using esophageally-fistulated cows in May, June, July, August, and September of 2000. Forage samples were freeze-dried and later analyzed for IVDMD. The IVDMD was used to estimate the rate of passage (kp) us - ing the following equation: kp = 0.07 * IVDMD (%) - 0.20. The kp was then used to determine the mean retention time (MRT = 1/kp) and a 10-hour passage lag was added to the MRT to yield the total mean retention time (TMRT). In the present experiment, two ruminally and duodenally cannu - lated steers were used to incubate 5 x 10 cm dacron bags with 50 m pore size. Bags contained 1.25 g of forage ground through a 2 mm screen. A mixed ration of 70% smooth brome - grass hay and 30% concentrate was fed twice daily for a total intake of 1.8% BW. Four bags per steer were ruminally incubated for 75% of the TMRT determined using the IVDMD. The 75% TMRT incubation time points of the meadow and range samples are shown in Table 1. After ruminal incubation, all bags were frozen. Two bags per sample were later thawed and prepared for duodenal insertion. Bags were first pre-incu - bated in a pepsin and HCl solution at 37C for 3 hours to simulate abomasal digestion. Bags were inserted into the duodenum 2 hours post-feeding at a rate of 1 bag every 0.1 hour for a total of 12 to 13 bags/steer/day. Bags were recovered in the feces beginning 12 hours after insertion and frozen until all bags had been collected. After all bags had been intestinally incubated, the ruminally incubated bags and in - testinally incubated bags were thawed and washed in a washing machine for 0.25 hours. This was done using five rinse cycles consisting of a 1 minute agitation and a 2-minute spin per cycle. Bags were subsequently bulk refluxed in neutral detergent solution to remove microbial contamination of the residue. Residues were then ana - lyzed for NDIN using a combustion method. In the second experiment, feed ingredients and forage diet samples from four previous growing tri - als were analyzed for UIP, TTIDP, and UIPDIG. Three of these previ - ous trials were grazing studies from 2002, 2003, and 2004 where animals rotationally grazed smooth brome - grass pastures. In each of these three studies, two ruminally cannulated heifers per pasture were used to col - lect forage diet samples of the grazed forage throughout the grazing season, but collection strategies differed each year. In 2002, all pastures in the rota - tion were sampled at two time points and samples were composited by time. In 2003, diet samples were collected at three times during the trial from the pasture where cattle were grazing at that time. In 2004, cattle grazed each pasture for one day. Two pastures were sampled at the start of each rota - tion, one was a pasture the cattle had grazed the previous day and the other was the pasture they would graze that Josh R. Benton Jim C.

Adams1 Summary Digestibility of undegradable intake protein of subirrigated meadows, upland native range, smooth bromegrass, and other feedstuffs used in several growing trials was measured using the mobile nylon bag technique. In general, as the grazing season progressed, undegrad - able intake protein (UIP) digestibility of grazed forages decreased. Also, UIP digestibility was highly variable among feedstuffs. Compared to the constant 80% digestibility of UIP used by the 1996 Beef NRC, grazed and harvested forages tend to have much lower UIP di - gestibility values while the supplemental protein sources evaluated tend to have higher UIP digestibility values. Introduction The amount of protein available for absorption in the small intestine of cattle depends on the amount of microbial protein and ruminally un - degradable intake protein (UIP) flow - ing to the small intestine as well as the digestibility of these protein sources in the small intestine. Current protein evaluation systems acknowledge that intestinal digestibility of proteins may differ between feedstuffs, but the NRC (1996) model for beef cattle still uses a constant, true digestibility of 80% for UIP, due to a lack of available data on UIP digestibility (UIPDIG). Research conducted at the University of Nebraska ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Re - port, pp. 25-27) showed UIP content and UIPDIG of forages is low which suggests the values used by the NRC (1996) model for the UIP content and UIPDIG of feedstuffs may be overes - timated. The objectives of our study were: 1) to determine effects of season (Continued on next page)Page 24 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

The other non - grazed feed ingredients analyzed in Experiment 2 were: the commercially available methionine source Smart - amine M J (MET), corn cobs (COB), bloodmeal (BM), corn gluten meal (CGM), SoyPass J (SP), feathermeal (FM), two sources of dry distillers grains (DDGA and DDGB), sorghum silage (SS) and corn bran ruminally incubated for 21 or 30 hours (BRAN21 or BRAN 30). The grazed forage samples and SS were freeze-dried and then all samples were ground through a 2 mm screen for the in situ incuba - tions or a 1 mm screen for lab analy - sis. In vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD) was determined on the forage samples (COB, SS and grazed forage samples) and used to estimate TMRT as described in Experiment 1. Two ruminally and duodenally cannulated steers were used to in - cubate 5 x 10 cm dacron bags with 50 m pore size containing 1.25 g of sample. Steers were fed smooth bromegrass hay twice daily at ad libitum intake. Four bags per steer of each sample were ruminally incu - bated during one of two incubation periods. The forage samples (COB, SS and grazed forage diet samples) were ruminally incubated for 75% of their TMRT. All other feed ingredients were ruminally incubated for 16 hours except for the BRAN21 and BRAN30. T able 1.

The UIP, TTIDP, and UIPDIG was analyzed with animal as a random effect. For Experiment 2, data were analyzed with the MIXED procedures of SAS. For grazed forage diet samples, the animal used to collect the diet sample was the experimental unit and repeat - ed measures were used when samples were collected more than three times. For nongrazed samples, the animal in which the bags were inserted was the experimental unit. Means were sepa - rated using the pdiff option in SAS and contrasts were developed to make more precise comparisons for DDGA versus DDGB and BRAN21 versus BRAN30.

For range, the CP and IVDM D values decreased ( P < 0.05) 22.7 and 22.4%, respectively, from May to September. Meadow had higher ( P < 0.01) CP values compared to range from May to August and meadow also had a higher ( P < 0.01) IVDMD value in June compared to range. Undegradable intake protein (% DM) of meadow was similar (P > 0.07) from May to August, and UIP was also similar ( P > 0.12) in July, August, and September. From June to September, UIP decreased 32.9% for meadow. For range, UIP was similar ( P > 0.05) in May, June, and July and from July to September, UIP increased 64.6%. For meadow, TTIDP was similar ( P > 0.10) from May to September. For range, TTIDP was similar ( P > 0.38) from May to July and then there was an 81.5% increas e from July to September.

Harvested forages (SS and COBS) and corn bran had UIPDIG values that fit within the range of the grazed forage samples tested in this data set; UIP content and digestibility were low. These data suggest there is large variation in UIPDIG among feed - stuffs. Compared to the constant 80% UIP digestibility currently used by the 1996 Beef NRC, forages tend to have lower UIPDIG values and several protein sources tend to have higher UIPDIG values. The protein charac - teristics tended to act similar across the grazed forages tested. With the exception of smooth bromegrass col - lected in 2002, both UIP and TTIDP content increased and UIPDIG de - creased as grazing season progressed and forage quality declined. The UIP - DIG is highly variable across grazed forages and is likely related to forage quality and CP content. The UIPDIG ranged from 58.1% of UIP for smooth bromegrass that was 69.5% IVDMD and 25.3% CP in May of 2003 to 6.5% for mature subirrigated meadow in September of 2000 that was 50.4% IVDMD and 8.5% CP. All UIPDIG measured in grazed forages were much lower than the 80% currently used by the 1996 Beef NRC model. Our data suggest for - ages supply little MP in the form of UIP because of low UIP and UIPDIG values and MP supply may be over - estimated using current prediction models. Using a simple model to esti - mate total MP supply with the optio n to change UIP digestibility from 80%, we calculated the total MP for two forage samples from this study. In our model, microbial efficiency was reduced with lower forage quality. For smooth bromegrass that had 58.1% UIP digestibility, total MP supply was reduced 6.4% by using 58.1% in - stead of 80% UIP digestibility in the model. For subirrigated meadow that had 6.5% UIP digestibility, total MP supply was reduced 33.8% by using 6.5% instead of 80% UIP digestibility. From the modeling, it appears that us - ing a constant 80% UIP digestibility is more of a problem for lower quality forages where the true UIP digest - ibility may be much lower. While 80% may be an appropriate value on aver - age, more specific data for different feedstuffs is needed if accurate me - tabolizable protein (MP) balances are to be determined for different classes of cattle. 1Joshua R.

However, DDG also contains 8 to 12% fat (DM) and 40 to 45% fiber (DM). The relative contributions of these nutrients to the performance of cattle grazing forages remains undoc - umented and are important because DDG nutrient compositions will change as the milling industry con - tinues to alter the manner in which it processes corn. The purpose of the present study was to determine the relative contributions of UIP and fat to the performance of growing cattle grazing high quality forage. Procedure One hundred twenty crossbred heifers (811 lb, SD=86) were used to determine the relative contribu - tions of UIP and fat measured as ether extract (EE) in DDG to animal performance. Heifers were blocked by previous gain and randomly re - ceived one of ten treatments in a 3 x 3 + 1 factorial arrangement with three supplements, three levels, and a control. Heifers rotationally grazed six smooth bromegrass pastures (IVDMD=65.7%, CP=20.8% DM, UIP=2.17% DM) which were nine acres each. Supplements were pro - vided individually using a Calan gate system and refusals for each animal were collected weekly. Heifers were limit fed for 5 days at the beginning and end of the trial and weights were measured for three consecutive days to minimize variation in gut fill. Supplements are shown in Table 1 and included DDG (15.8% UIP, 9.67% EE), corn gluten meal (CGM; 31.6% UIP, 0.83% EE) to provide UIP, or corn oil (OIL; 0.74% UIP, 19.3% EE) to provide fat. Corn gluten meal and corn oil were selected as sources of UIP and fat, respectively, because like DDG, they are derived from corn and therefore their amino acid and fatty acid profiles, respectively, should be similar to DDG. Levels of daily DDG supplementation were 1.65, 3.30, and 4.95 lb DM per head while CGM and OIL were supplemented daily with 0.83, 1.65, and 2.48 lb DM per head. While heifers supplemented with CGM and OIL were offered half the DM compared to heifers supple - mented with DDG, their respective concentrations of UIP and fat were doubled such that the levels of these Jim C. MacDonald Galen E. Erickson T erry J. Klopfenstein1 Summary Growing heifers grazing smooth bromegrass pastures were supplemented daily with dry distillers grains, corn bran + corn oil, or corn bran + corn gluten meal to determine the relative contributions of fat and undegradable intake protein in dried distillers grains to animal performance. For cattle sup - plemented from 0 to 0.75% body weight with dried distillers grains, ADG was improved by 0.14 lb for every 0.10% BW increase in dried distillers grains supple - mentation. Cattle supplemented with corn bran + corn gluten meal gained 38% as much as cattle supplemented with dry distillers grains while cattle supplemented with corn bran + corn oil showed no improvement in ADG over cattle supplemented with a corn bran control supplement. Neither fat nor un - degradable intake protein account for all the observed improvement in ADG from supplementing dry distillers grains. Introduction Dried distillers grains (DDG) have been shown to increase ADG in ani - mals consuming both low and high quality forages ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp. 18-20) yet the rea - son for increased gain is unproven. It has long been recognized that cattle consuming actively growing forages will respond to undegradable in - take protein (UIP) supplementation because the protein in the forage is highly degraded in the rumen caus - ing a metabolizable protein (MP) deficiency ( 1990 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp. 65-67).

For CGM and OIL, corn bran was used as a carrier and molasses was included to bind the supplement and improve palatability. Salt was included in all supplements at levels that provided 25 g per head per day. Forage intake for cattle consuming DDG was predicted from animal per - formance using TDN values for DDG and forage samples. Forage TDN was estimated from IVDMD values that were adjusted to In vivo digestibility values. This was accomplished by including five hay samples which had known In vivo digestibility values as standards in the In vitro run. The In vitro values were regressed on the known In vivo values for the five stan - dards and the resulting equation was used to adjust the forage samples of interest. The TDN for DDG was set at 108% based on its comparison to corn fed in forage diets ( 2003 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp. 8-10). Animal performance was used to predict TDN intake using the following equa and BW are expressed in pounds. This product was adjusted using the following equation that more accur - ately reflects forage intake in the current situation based on a study where cattle consuming forage diets were supplemented DDG and forage intake was directly measured ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp. 18- 20): adjusted TDN intake = (predicted TDN intake - 2.07) / 0.94. The TDN from DDG intake was subtracted from TDN required to meet animal performance and the remaining TDN requirement was divided by TDN of the forage to yield forage intake. Statistical analysis was conducted using the mixed procedures of SAS with block considered to be a random effect. Many heifers consumed less supplement than was offered such that it was not logical to analyze the data based on treatment allotments. Therefore, actual average daily UIP Figure 1.

When expressed as DM intake as %BW (data not shown), the DDG slope was 1.42 ( 0.39) and was significantly different from 0 (P<0.01). This equates to an 0.14 lb increase in ADG for every 0.10 %BW \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved. 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 29 increase in DDG supplementation within the range of DDG supplement - ed in this study. Cattle in this study consumed DDG from 0 to 0.75% BW. Using these data, a 700 lb steer consuming 3.5 lb DDG (0.50% BW) would be expected to gain 0.70 lb/day more than the same animal not con - suming DDG. This response matches closely with a previous gain response with high quality forages observed at the University of Nebraska ( 2005 Ne - braska Beef Cattle Report, pp. 18-20), which measured a 0.13 lb increase in ADG for every 0.10 %BW increase in DDG supplementation. Performance tended to be improve d (P=0.14) from CGM supplementation, while the slope for OIL was not different from 0 (P=0.26). The response from DDG tended to be greater than the re - sponse from both CGM (P=0.10) and OIL (P=0.09). The slope for CGM was 38.5% the slope for DDG which may represent the proportion of the (P<0.07), but no significant decrease in forage intake (P=0.27) due to DDG supplementation. We have previously reported that one pound of DDG replaces from 1.72 ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp. 25-27) to 0.53 (2005 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp. 18-20) pounds of forage in graz - ing cattle. The replacement rate for the current study was 0.38 lb forage replace d per lb DDG supplemented, but this small change was not signifi - cantly different from 0 when account - ing for the variation in this study. Forage replacement may be inversely related to ADG because cattle in the current study showed the greatest gain response with no significant change in forage intake, while cattle in the afore mentioned study with the largest reduction in forage intake showed the smallest improvement in ADG. This issue needs to be developed further in the future because forage replacement is an important factor in determining the value of DDG in grazing situa - tions. Dry distillers grains significantly increase ADG in cattle grazing high quality forages. The response to CGM and lack of response to OIL in this data set suggests a portion of the increased ADG is due to meeting a MP deficiency. An associative effect of providing a combination of protein and energy from UIP and fat may be responsible for the additional gain observed from DDG supplementation. Other nutrients such as phosphorus may also play a role, but cannot be separated from these data. 1Jim C. MacDonald, graduate student; Gale n Erickson, assistant professor, Animal Scienc e , Lincoln; T erry J. Klopfenstein, professor, Animal Science, Lincoln.respons e of DDG that is due to meet - ing a MP deficienc y . The fact that the response of CGM is linear rather than quadratic may indicate cattle used excess protein for energy. The lack of response from adding energy from OIL supplementation is not surpris - ing considering MP is first limiting in these cattle and ruminal microbes yield essentially no microbial crude protein from fat. Therefore, supply - ing additional energy without protein should not be expected to improve gain. However, the added response of DDG over CGM and OIL suggests that adding energy and protein in combination may allow for additional gain. Other nutrients provided in DDG, such as phosphorus may also contribute to the additional gain, but we are unable to separate their relative contributions with these data.

The objectives of this trial were to predict forage intake, determine rate of replacement of forage, and deter - mine effects on animal performance by increasing supplemental DDGS, as well as evaluate economics of supple - menting DDGS. Procedure Grazing Fifty-six yearling steers (686 54 lb) were stratified by weight and randomly assigned to one of five treat - ments in a completely randomized design. Treatments were supplement - ing varying levels of DDGS to steers continuously grazing native summer Sandhill range. Trial duration was 88 days, divided into three periods. Weights were obtained at the begin - ning and end of the trial. Levels of DDGS were on a percent BW basis. To determine DDGS levels the high - est level was set at 7.5 lbs (DM), with the intention steers would consume 7.5 lbs (DM) during days 31-60. The four remaining lower levels were deter mined as a percent, 0, 25, 50, and 75%, of the highest level. Treat - ment levels were 0, 0.26, 0.51, 0.77 and 1.03 %BW. Weights were projected at the beginning of each period, and DDGS offered adjusted to account for weight gain. Steers continuously grazed except during supplementation six days/week. Steers were gathered in the morning (six days/week) and individually supplemented, in feed - ing crates, their respective amount of DDGS. Distillers grains offered and any refusals were weighed out daily to determine DDGS intake. Feedlot and Carcass All steers were placed into a feedlot at West Central Research and Exten - sion Center at North Platte, where they were fed for 113 days. Steers were placed into two pens per treatment, for a step up period of 21 days and a period of 37 days on finisher to esti - mate individual intakes. All animals were combined into one pen for the remaining 55 days. Three animals were removed from the feedlot study due to death or sickness. The animals were slaughtered and carcass data were collected. Prediction of Individual Intakes Three esophageally fistulated cows were used to collect monthly diet samples to determine TDN of the pasture. To predict forage intake, total TDN intake was calculated using an equation developed by Winchester, based on ADG and BW, TDN = 0.0553 BW2/3(1 + 0.805GAIN) . The predicted total TDN intake was adjusted using a regression equation obtained from a previous growing trial ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Report , pp 18-20) where TDN intake, BW, and ADG were known. This regression equation was acquired by predicting total TDN intake using Winchester =s equation and regressing it against known total TDN intake; without nonsupplemented cattle. The resulting equation is as follows, where adjusted TDN intake = (known TDN intake - 2.069 ) \u00f7 (R2 intake estab - lishes the total TDN consumed by the animal. Total DDGS TDN intake was subtracted from the adjusted total TDN intake. The remaining TDN value was divided by the known diet TDN (57.22% TDN), resulting in for - age DMI. Economical Analysis Two economical analyses were conducted. The first analysis, esti - mated the added value of supplement - ing DDGS to animals on pasture, accounting for value in both added gain and reduced forage intake. The additional gain was valued by deter - mining the income from selling the Sarah E. Morris Jim C. MacDonald Don C. Adams T erry J. Klopfenstein Rex L. Davis Jim R. T eichert1 Summary Yearling steers continuously grazed summer native Sandhill range, with supplementation of varying levels of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS): 0.26, 0.51, 0.77, and 1.03% BW. Forage intakes were predicted us - ing an equation based on TDN. Forage intakes linearly decreased as level of DDGS increased. Average daily gain linearly increased as level of DDGS increased. Steers were finished and slaughtered. No significant differences were found in feedlot performance or carcass data. Economical analyses were conducted and suggest supplementing DDGS is profitable. Increased gain from supplementing yearling steers DDGS while grazing summer range did not affect feedlot performance and can be economical. Introduction Increased production of ethanol in Nebraska is increasing the availability of distillers by-products for produc - ers. Distillers grains plus solubles (DGS), is an excellent supplement for cattle in grazing situations, due to its high energy , protein, and phosphorus levels. In grazing situations or for producers not in close proximity to an ethanol plant, dried DGS (DDGS) are easier to transport, store, and handle than the wet product. The cost of grazing forages is increasing, while the cost of DDGS is decreasing. This in - creased cost of grazing may encourage producers to look for a substitution or supplemental source for their for - ages, in which DDGS may be a good \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

Handling costs for all ingredients were accounted for in the analysis. Yardage was set at $0.30/day, and in - terest at 9%. Break even prices were calculated on $/cwt basis. Statistical Analysis All data were analyzed using the mixed procedure in SAS. Results Summer and Feedlot Performance Summer ADG linearly increased (P < 0.01) as level of DDGS increased (Figure 1). Controls gained 1.71 lb per day with the rate of increased gain at 0.07 lb per lb of DDGS. Predicted for - age DMI decreased linearly ( P < 0.01) as level of DDGS increased (Figure 2). Forage intake for control steers was 18.09 lb per day, with the rate of decline in forage intake at 1.66 lb per pound of DDGS. These results suggest that supplementing DDGS replaces forage while increasing animal perfor - mance. Feedlot ADG, DMI, and F:G (Table 1) were not significantly dif - ferent. In addition, no significant differences were found in any carcass data collected. These results suggest addition a l gain attained from DDGS supplementation during the summer does not affect cattle performance in the feedlot or carcass traits. Economical Analyses Supplementing DDGS to cattle in grazing situations appears to be profitable through increased selling weight and decreased forage costs. Table 2 shows the value of supple - menting all levels of DDGS. Total DDGS value averaged over all levels of supplementation was $163.51. The systems approach of evaluating the economics of supplementing DDGS during the summer versus through the feedlot (Table 3) suggests that if Figure 1.

The forage replaced by DDGS was valued at the 2004 grazing price (animal unit month) in Nebraska. The second analysis evaluated the profitability of selling the animals after the summer grazing period ver - sus the feedlot period. The purchase price was based off of the five-year average for feeder calf prices at 700 lb during April ($98.44/cwt). Price of DDGS was based on $110/ton (as-is) with labor and delivery costs ac - counted for.

In contrast if the cattle were retained through the feedlot, breakeven costs would decrease, with lowest breakeven at the third level (0.51%BW) of supplementation at $78.62/cwt. These results suggest supplementing DDGS is profitable for either selling cattle off grass or retain - ing ownership through the feedlot. In conclusion, DDGS appear to be a viable supplement to cattle in graz - ing situations with increased animal performance and decreased forage intake, with no adverse effects in feedlot performance or carcass traits. Economical analysis evaluating added value of DDGS, suggest supplement - ing DDGS is economical in grazing situations. Evaluation of economics from a systems standpoint, suggest supplementation of DDGS is econom - ically advantageous during both the grazing and feedlot periods. 1Sarah Morris and Jim MacDonald, graduate students; T erry Klopfenstein, professor, Animal Science, Lincoln; and Don Adams, pro - fessor; Rex Davis, beef unit, Jim T eichert, beef unit, Animal Science, West Central Research and Extension Center, North Platte.T able 2.

All rights reserved. 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 33 Influence of Dried Distillers Grains Supplementation Frequency on Forage Digestibility and Growth Performance L. Aaron Stalker Don C. Adams T erry J. Klopfenstein1 Summary Two experiments evaluated the influence of dried distillers grains supplementation frequency on forage digestibilit y and growth of yearling steers. In Exp. 1, treatments were dried distillers grains fed at 16.7% of the diet either daily, every other day or every third day. Diet DM, OM and NDF digestibility decreased linearly as dried distillers grains supplementation occurre d less frequently. In Exp. 2, 48 crossbred steers were used in a two-year study to compare corn/soybean meal with dried distillers grains as winter supplements. Steers performed similarly when supplements were fed 6 days/week but performance was decreased when dried distillers grains was fed 3 days/ week. Better animal performance may result from more frequent supplementa - tion of dried distillers grains. Introduction In many forage - based production systems, supplemental protein is pro - vided during periods of limited forage quality and/or quantity to increase animal weight gain and improve for - age intake and digestibility. Supple - mental feeds comprise a significant portion of variable costs of beef pro - duction and providing protein supple - ments less frequently may reduce costs without negatively impacting performance. In situations where forage energy content does not support desired productivity, energy supplementation may be necessary. Energy supplements containing nonstructural carbohy - drates, such as cereal grains, often depress forage intake and digestibil - ity. However, balancing the diet for degrade d intake protein requirements may alleviate this problem. Dried distillers grains (DDG) is an excellent source of energy that does not contain nonstructural carbohydrates. Addi - tionally, the high undegraded intake protein and phosphorus content make DDG an ideal supplement for growing cattle consuming forage based diets. Objectives of these experiments were to determine the influence of DDG supplementation frequency on intake, digestibility and growth per - formance of beef cattle consuming forage based diets. Procedure Experiment 1: Digestion Trial Eight crossbred steers (818 66 lb) were assigned randomly to treatment in a replicated 3 X 3 Latin square desig n with three periods. Treatments were DDG fed either daily, every other day or every third day. Dried distillers grains comprised 16.7% of the diet dry matter for all treatments. Steers were housed in individual pens (6 x 3 m) in a semi - enclosed barn with unrestricte d access to fresh water. Periods lasted 21 days and total tract diet digestion was assessed from day 16 to 21 of each period. On day 1 through 9 of each period, cool season grass hay, chopped to a 15 - cm particle size, was provided ad libitum, with orts from the previous day deter - mined before feeding. Beginning on day 10 of each period, amount of hay fed was reduced to 90% of the average hay intake on day 1 through 9. Limit - ing amount of hay offered resulted in elimination of orts during the fecal collection period. Before hay feeding, DDG was pro - vided to those steers receiving DDG every day at 16.7% of the previous day=s DMI. For steers assigned to every other day and every third day treatments, DDG was fed at 33.3% of the average DMI for the previous two day and 50.0% of the average DMI for the previous three days, respectively, on the appropriate supplementation day. Nutrient content of hay and DDG is listed in Table 1. Steers were fitted with fecal bags on day 16, with bags changed once every 12 hours, for a total fecal collection period of 6 days. Digestibility of DDG NDF was assumed to be 80%. Experiment 2: Steer Performance Trial Each year for two years, 48 cross - bred steers (470 49 lb) were strati - fied by weight and assigned randomly to replicated supplementation groups, with 6 steers per group. Steers in the same supplementation group were identified by a colored ear tag. Two supplementation groups (ear tag colors) were assigned randomly to treatments. Treatments were designed to result in similar ADG using 1996 NRC software. The control (CON) treatment consisted of ad libitum acces s to grass hay in a drylot and the daily equivalent of 4.4 lb/steer (DM) corn - soybean based supplement (Table 2) fed 6 days/week. Steers in all other treatments grazed upland winter range in a common pasture and were sorted into one of 6 pens 6 days/week according to ear tag color and fed the daily equivalent of either 6.0 lb/steer (DM) corn - soybean based supplement 6 days/week (SBM), 4.2 lb/steer (DM) DDG based supplement 6 d/week 4.2 lb/steer (DM) DDG based supplement 3 days/week (DDG3).

Treatments were designed to supply similar amounts of energy and meet metabolizable protein and degraded intake protein requirements accord - ing to NRC (1996). Previous research has shown dried distillers grains has about 125% the energy of corn. Therefore, calves were supplemented with 70% as much dry matter to pro - vide equivalent energy intake. Steers were weighed on two con - secutive days upon initiation and ter - mination of the 62-day trial without limiting intake prior to weighing. Hay used in the trial was subsampled and analyzed for DM, CP and IVDMD, while supplements fed were analyzed for CP. A partial budget was used to com - pare costs and calculate cost of gain associated with each treatment. Hay, corn and soybean meal were valued using a 10 year average price ( Crop and Livestock Prices for Nebraska Pro - ducers, 2005 ; $60.87/ton, $2.22/bu, and $9.68/cwt respectively) while a price of $75/ton was used for dried distillers grains. Costs included $11.79/ton for labor and equipment associated with feeding hay and $35/ ton for delivery of corn, soybean meal and distillers grains. Winter range valued at half the current average rate for a summer AUM, according to pub - lished data ( Nebraska Farm Real Estate Market Developments, 2003 - 2004 ). It was assumed cattle were checked daily, therefore costs associated with delivering supplement were the same for all treatments. Results Experiment 1: Digestion Trial Hay ( P = 0.06) and total ( P = 0.08) DMI decreased linearly as supplemen - tation frequency decreased (Table 3). Similarly, as DDG supplementation frequency decreased so did hay (P = 0.07) and total ( P = 0.08) organic matter intake. Daily NDF intake decrease d linearly ( P = 0.07) as sup - plementation frequency decreased.

Cost of gain was greatest for CON treated steers pri - marily because of costs associated with feeding hay (Table 5). Total costs were least but gain was also least for DDG3 steers making cost of gain greatest among steers grazing range. Feeding dried distillers grains six days per week resulted in the lowest cost of gain. Conclusion Forage digestibility and animal performance were reduced and cost of gain increased when DDG were fed less frequently. These results may be related to the fat content of DDG. Previous research has shown DDG has about 125% the energy of corn. Therefore, calves were supplemented with 70% as much DM to provide equivalent energy intake. This con - cept is validated by the equal gains of calves fed CSM and DDG6 primarily because of lower amount fed. 1Aaron Stalker, graduate student; Don Adam s , professor, Animal Science, West Central Research and Extension Center, North Platte; T erry Klopfenstein, professor, Animal Science, Lincoln.T able 4.

Other research has demonstrated reduced gain in animals fed DDG less frequently ( 2003 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 8 - 10). Incomplete consumption of supplement may also have contrib - uted to reduced performance. Steers in the DDG3 treatment consumed the equivalent of 0.3 lb per day less supplement than DDG6 steers.

Steers were limit fed a 47.5% alfalfa, 47.5% WCGF 5% supplement diet for five days at the beginning and end of the trial and weighed for three consecu - tive days to minimize variation due to gut fill. Treatments included 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 lb DDGS/ head daily adjusted to a percentage of body weight (.29, .49, .69, .88, 1.08, and 1.27 % respectively.) The DDGS contained 12.4% fat and 30.1% CP. Calves were weighed on consecutive days biweekly to adjust the amount of DDGS offere d . Minerals and vitamins were added to the DDGS supplements to meet NRC requirements. All steers were individually fed supplement using Calan electronic gates. Thirty calves were selected as a control group and fed a diet of 70.9% brome hay, and 29.1% sor - ghum silag e with DDGS treatments assigned randomly within the group. Diet intake was directly measured for individual steers in the control group. Ninety calves grazed 90 acres of corn residue for 95 days. Grazing calves were gathered every morning at 6:30 and allowed three hours to consume supplement, then returned to the field for grazing. Corn residue samples were collec - ted biweekly using two ruminally canulated heifers and IVDMD was determined. Results Average daily gain increased (P < .001) with increasing levels of DDGS, with grazing calves ranging from .9 to 1.8 lbs/day (Figure 1). Some calves fed the two highest levels of DDGS (5.5 and 6.5 lb/day ) did not consume all of the DDGS offered. Actual DDGS intakes are used in Figur e 1 to determine ADG response to level of DDGS. The quadratic effec t of DDGS levels on ADG suggests that gains didn't increase much above 1.1% of body weight of DDGS (Figure 2). Because there were some refusals of DDGS at the highest level of feeding (6.5 lb/day), we suggest a practical limit of 1.1% BW of DDGS supple - mentation (5.5 lb/day). Obviously, the amount (lb/day ) would be greater for larger calves.Kristin H. Gustad T erry J. Klopfenstein Galen E. Erickson Kyle J. V ander Pol Jim C. MacDonald Matt A. Greenquist1 Summary Dried distillers grains (DDGS) were fed to weanling steer calves grazing nonirrigated corn residue to determine daily gain response and residue intake response to increasing levels of DDGS (from 1.5 to 6.5 lb/day in 1 lb incre - ments). The DDGS was fed individually using Calan electronic gates. Daily gain increased from 0.9 (1.5 lb DDGS) to 1.8 (6.5 lb DDGS) lb/day . Forage intake decreased from to 8.3 (6.5 lb DDGS) lb/day . - vide information for selecting a DDGS supplementation level to achieve a tar - get gain. Introduction Due to their high energy (108% TDN) and high protein content (30.1%) dried distillers grains (DDGS) fit well as a protein and (or) energy supplement in many grazing situa - tions. Corn residues are a relatively inexpensive feed resource, but are low in protein and energy, especially for growing calves, backgrounded for entry into the feedlot or for summer pasture, or for replacement heifers. Beef producers often target a specific ADG so it is important to know the amount of DDGS to supplement to calves grazing corn residues in order to achieve a desired level of daily gain. The objectives of our experiment were to determine the effects on ADG of incremental DDGS supplementation to calves grazing corn residue, and predict the effect of supplementation on forage intake.

Animal selectivity is the logi - cal explanation to an overall decrease in quality with time. The low point fell at 44.0% during a period of snow cover. Intake of the control, hay-fed calves decreased by about 27% as DDGS level increased from 1.5 to 6.5 lb/day. We therefore assume a similar decrease in intake of the corn residue. This could provide a feasible option to extend the stocking rates of corn stalks, while still improving ADG. Theoretically, one could increase stocking rate by 27%. Figure 1 provides information necessary for a producer to determine the DDGS supplementation level necessary to achieve a targeted gain. For example, if 1.5 ADG is desired, then 4 lb of DDGS would be fed. The calves would consume 73% as much residue. We estimate cornstalk graz - ing cost at $.12 per calf daily. With reduced consumption of corn residue (73%) the cost would be $.09 per day. We estimat e delivered price of DDGS to be about $110 per ton. the 4 lb of DDGS (4.3 lb air dry) would cost $.24 per day for a total feed cost of $.33 per day or $.213 per lb gain at assistan t professor; Kyle J.

Klopfenstein W ayne A. Fithian1 Summary The influence of corn hybrid and processing method onsite and extent of DM, starch, and protein digestibility was determined using the mobile bag technique. Samples consisted of three hybrid s with known digestibility and feeding value processed as either dry- rolled corn (DRC) or high-moisture corn (HMC). Ruminal and total tract nutrient digestibilities were greater for HMC compared to DRC. Differences among hybrids existed for all variables measured except ruminal starch digest - ibility and degradable intake protein. Undegradable intake protein (UIP) digestibility was greater for HMC compared to DRC (77.8 and 73.7%, respectively). However, UIP was lower for HMC than DRC. Differences among processing methods and hybrids exist for site and extent of nutrient digestibility. Introduction The site of digestion (i.e., rumen or intestinal) is critical to understand - ing the impact on performance. More intense corn processing methods or selection of hybrids with desirable kernel traits has been shown to im - prove the extent of starch digestion by increasing the amount digested in the rumen. Previous research also shows that degradable intake protein (DIP) for high moisture corn increases as moisture and length of ensiling increases. However, the effects of high-moisture ensiling on undegrad - able intake protein (UIP) digestibility are unknown. The current NRC Beef Cattle Nutrient Requirement model assumes UIP digestibility is 80% for all feedstuffs. Because UIP from corn provides a large amount of metaboliz - able protein (MP) to finishing cattle, small changes in UIP digestibility can have a large impact on MP. The objec - tives of this research were to deter - mine site and extent of DM and starch digestibility, and to determine unde - gradable intake protein digestibility of three hybrids processed as either dry- rolled corn (DRC) or high-moisture corn (HMC). Procedure Two ruminally and duodenally cannulated steers were used to incu - bate 5 x 10 cm dacron bags with a 50 um pore size. Bags were filled with 1.75 g of DM sample ground through a 0.25 in screen to simulate masticated corn. Dry rolled corn samples were ground as-is and HMC samples were ground frozen. The samples consisted of three hybrids: H - 8562 (1), 33P67 (2), and H - 9230 Bt (3), processed eithe r as DRC or reconstituted HMC. Dry corn was coarsely rolled, recon - stituted to 28% moisture and ensiled to mimic early harvested HMC. These hybrids were also fed in previ - ous feedlot and metabolism studies (2004 Nebraska Beef Reports, pp. 54; 2006 Nebraska Beef Reports , pp. 40). A concentrate diet consisting of 68.5% DRC, 20% wet corn gluten feed, 7.5% alfalfa, and 4% supplement was fed at 1.8% BW. Particle size analysis was performed using a wet sieving method to determine the geometric mean diameter and geometric standard deviation. An incubation time of 22 hours was used representing 75% of the mean retention time calculated from the inverse of a passage rate at 3.44%/hour. Fifty-eight bags/sample were ruminally incubated in each animal and frozen. Eight bags/sample were used to measure ruminal digest - ibility, the remaining 50 bags/sample were thawed and prepared for duode - nal insertion. To simulate abomasal digestion, bags were incubated in a pepsin and HCl solution (1 g pepsin/L of 0.01 N HCl) at 37oC for 3 hours. Fourteen bags were inserted daily into the duodenum and subsequently frozen after being recovered in the feces. After intestinal incubation, the ruminally incubated bags and intes - tinally incubated bags were thawed and machine rinsed along with four bags/sample that were not incubated. The nonincubated bags were used to determine the percentage residue that was washed out without incuba - tion. Residue from twenty bags was composited within animal for the intestinal samples to determine de - gradable intake protein, undegradable intake protein digestibility, and starch digestibility. Results Particle size analysis indicated there were differences among hybrid s and processing methods for geome - tric mean diameter (GMD), and geometric standard deviation (GSD). The GMD was greater ( P < 0.01) for DRC compared to HMC (2193 m and 1184 m, respectively). The differences among processing methods for GMD are comparable to true masticated samples with HMC having a smaller GMD than DRC. Hybrid 2 had the largest GMD, followed by hybrids 1 and 3. There was no attempt to change the particle size among hybri d s by altering the knives on the mill. The percent washout for the 0 h samples were 2.4 times greater ( P < 0.01) for HMC compared to DRC (data not shown). The percent washout for hy - brids 1 and 3 were approximately 50% greater ( P = 0.01) than hybrid 2. There was an inverse relationship (r = -0.94) between GMD and % washout. As the GMD increased, the percent of sample washed out of the bag decreased due to less surface area of the endosperm exposed.\u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

Digestible UI P among hybrids was greatest for hybrid 1, intermediate for hybrid 3, and low - est for hybrid 2. A hybrid by process - ing method interaction also existed for total-tract C P digestibility. Total- tract C P digestibility was greater for hybrids 1 and 3 processed as HMC compared to hybrid 2. Crude protein digestibility for hybrid 2 processed as HMC was similar to hybrid 1 pro - cessed as DRC. When processed as DRC, total-tract C P digestibility was lowest for hybrid 2, intermediate for hybrid 3, and greatest for hybrid 1. The values presented are not abso - lute values but do show relative differ - ences for nutrient digestibility among hybrids and processing methods. The lower UIP digestibility for DRC may have an impact on metabolizable protein due to a greater proportion of UIP for DRC compared to HMC. Dif - ferences among processing methods and hybrids exist for site and extent of nutrient digestibility. 1 Matt Luebbe, research technician; Galen Erickson, assistant T erry Klopfen Animal Science, Lincoln; Wayne Fithia n , agronomy systems manager, Neb.Dry-matter digestibility Ruminal dry-matter digestibility (RDMD) was influenced by both and processing method. The RDMD for HMC was 33% greater compared to DRC. Ruminal DMD for hybrids 1 and 3 were greater com - pared to hybrid 2. A significant hybrid by processing method interaction ex - isted for postruminal DMD expressed as a percent entering the duodenum. Postruminal DMD for hybrids 1 and 3 processed as DRC were greater com - pared to hybrid 2. When processed as HMC, postruminal digestibility was greater for hybrid 2 compared to hy - brids 1 and 3. A greater postruminal DMD for hybrids 1 and 3 processed as DRC might be due to simply less residue entering the duodenum be - cause of a greater ruminal DMD for these hybrids. However, this does not account for the differences among hybrids when processed as HMC. One explanation might be that after a greater extent of RDMD for HMC, the residue inserted into the duodenum is less digestible. A hybrid by process - ing method interaction also existed for total-tract DMD. When processed as DRC, DMD for hybrid 1 was 1% greater ( P < 0.01) than hybrid 3, and 5% greater than hybrid 2. However, when processed as HMC there were no differences among hybrids. Rumi - nal DMD trends were similar to total tract DMD, but not statistically differ - ent due to the smaller number of bags used for ruminal DMD (n = 8) com - pared to total-tract DMD (n = 50). Starch digestibility There were no differences among hybrids for ruminal starch digestibility (SD). Ruminal SD was 37% greater for HMC compared to DRC (70.1, and 51.1%, respectively). Postruminal SD was greater for hybrids 1 and 3 compared to hybrid 2. Total-tract SD was also greater for hybrids 1 and 3 compared to hybrid 2. Postruminal and total-tract SD were also greater (P < 0.01) for HMC compared toDRC. Because starch is more digestible than the total residue entering the duode- num for postruminal DMD, postrumi- nal SD (expressed as a percentage enter - ing duodenum) is greater for samples that are digested more in the rumen. Protein digestibility Degradable intake protein (DIP) was greater for HMC samples com - pared to DRC similar to results found in a previous study ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Report, pp.31 ).

Altering kernel traits of hybrids us - ing more intense processing meth - ods such as high-moisture ensiling, fine grinding, or steam-flaking may take away the advantage of selecting hybrids with more desirable kernel traits ( 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 32-34). However, a more intense pro - cessing method may also increase the incidence of acidosis and reduce feed efficiency if starch fermentation is too rapid. Therefore, the objectives of our research were to 1) determine total- tract nutrient digestibility, 2) monitor intake patterns and ruminal pH, and 3) determine ruminal volatile fatty- acid concentrations of steers fed three hybrids with varying kernel traits and feeding value processed as either dry- rolled or high-moisture corn. Procedure Six ruminally cannulated steers (BW= 960 lb) were used in a 6x6 Latin square to determine digestibility of hybrids fed as dry - rolled (DRC) or high - moisture corn (HMC) . Treat - ments consisted of three hybrids: H-8562 (1), 33P67 (2), and H - 9230Bt (3); processed either as DRC or HMC in a 3x2 factorial arrangement. Dry- rolled corn was coarsely rolled and reconstituted to 28% moisture to mimic early harvested HMC. Diets consisted of 68.5% corn, 20% wet corn gluten feed, 7.5% alfalfa, and 4% supplement. In a previous study (2004 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 54-57) , F:G was 5.45 for hybrid 1, 5.62 for hybrid 2, and 5.95 for hybrid 3. Laboratory analyses indicate hybrid 1 has the largest/softest kernels, hybrid 3 the hardest/smallest kernels, and hybrid 2 was intermediate for both kernel hardness and size. Steers were fed for ad libitum intake once daily at 0730. Periods were 14 days in length with a 9-day adaptation to the diet, and a 5-day collection period to measure di -Matt K. Luebbe Galen E. Erickson T erry J. Klopfenstein W ayne A. Fithian1 Summary Three hybrids with different kernel traits and feeding value were selected from a previous study to determine effects of corn hybrid and processing method (high-moisture corn (HMC), or dry-rolled corn ruminal fermenta - tion. DMI, intake rate, and total time spent eating were greater for HMC than DRC. Changes in ruminal pH and pH variance were also greater for HMC compared to DRC. Total-tract nutrient digestibility was influenced by processing method and hybrid. Nutrient digestibilities were greatest for hybrid 1, and greater for HMC compared to DRC. There was a hybrid by processing method interaction for molar propor - tions of propionate and the acetate: pro - pionate (A:P) ratio. The magnitude of change for propionate molar proportions and the A:P ratio were different among hybrids when fed as HMC compared to DRC. Selection of hybrids with softer kernel traits and use of HMC will result in greater digestibility and favorable ruminal fermentation end products such as propionate. Introduction A greater extent of starch diges - tion is ideal for feedlot producers to maximize efficiency if acidosis can be controlled. The primary way to increase the extent of starch digestion for high-moisture and dry-rolled corn is to increase the rate of degradation in the rumen. Another way producers can maximize efficiency is by select - ing hybrids with kernel traits that are associated with improved digestibility when fed as dry-rolled corn ( 2004 gestibility, ruminal fermentation, pH, and intake. Steers were individually fed in pens during the adaptation on days 1-8 and moved into stantions for the collection period on day 9. Feed intake patterns and ruminal pH mea - surements were collected (days 10 to 14) as described in the 1998 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 71-75 . Feed intake measurements included DMI, intake rate, number of meals per day, and total time spent eating. The ruminal pH parameters measured were aver - age pH, pH change, pH variance, and maximum and minimum pH. Chromic oxide was used as an in - digestible marker for estimating fecal output. Boluses were administered via rumen cannula twice daily at 0700 and 1900 with each dose containing 7.5 grams chromic oxide. Fecal grab samples were collected three times daily on days 10 through 14 at 0, 6, and 12 hours post - feeding. Feed ingre - dients, feed refusals, and fecal samples were freeze-dried and analyzed to calculate nutrient digestibility. Ru - minal fluid samples were collected on day 14 of each period prior to feeding, and every two hours post-feeding for a 12-hour period to determine volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations. Results Dry matter, organic matter, and starch intake were similar among hybrids. Interestingly, nutrient intake was greater ( P < 0.02) for animals consuming HMC compared to DRC (Table 1). Total time spent eating and intake rate were also greater ( P < 0.05) for animals consuming HMC compared to DRC. Average meal size and number of meals/day were not different ( P > 0.05) among processing methods or hybrids and averaged 3.9 lb/meal and 7.2 meals/day, respec - tively. Total tract nutrient digestibilities were influenced by both hybrid and \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

DM and OM digestibility for hybrid 1 were greater ( P < 0.04) than for hybrid 2, and tended ( P = 0.07) to be greater than hybrid 3. Starch digestibility was also greater (P = 0.02) for hybrid 1 compared to hybrids 2 and 3. DM digestibility tended ( P = 0.10) to be greater for HMC than DRC. OM and starch digestibility were greater ( P = 0.05 and P = 0.02, respectively) for HMC than DRC. There was a tendency ( P = 0.10) for a hybrid by processing method interaction for average pH (Table 2). Animals consuming hybrids 1 and 2 as HMC had a higher average pH than for those fed the same hybrid as DRC. Conversely, average pH for animals consuming hybrid 3 had a lower pH when fed as HMC. Overall, the aver - age pH for HMC and DRC was 5.61, and 5.65, respectively. The change in pH (maximum to minimum) and pH variance were greater ( P < 0.05) for HMC than DRC, indicating that a more intense processing method has a more rapid fermentation rate than DRC. There was also a tendency ( P = 0.08) for minimum pH to be lower for HMC than DRC. One explana - tion for ruminal pH to be similar for animals consuming HMC and DRC could be due to more total time spent eating, and a tendency ( P = 0.12) for animals consuming HMC to eat more meals/day. The intake behavior could be due to the animal regulating its intake so they do not experience acidosis. Consuming a smaller quan - tity of feed more often and allowing T able 1.

Even though the addition of WCGF to these diets mediated the pH, there is enough fermentable starch in the DRC diets for animals to experience acido - sis. These animals also regulate intake similar to those consuming HMC di - ets but do not experience the changes in ruminal pH as rapidly (variance) or to the same extent (pH change). Ruminal fluid analyses indicate differences existed among hybrids and processing methods for VFA concen - trations (Table 2). There was a hybrid by processing method interaction for molar proportions (%) of propio - nate, and the acetate: propionate (A: P) ratio. The increase in molar% of propionate for HMC compared to DRC for hybrid 3 was greater than the increase for hybrids 1 and 2. The larger increase in the molar % of propionate suggests the harder kernel traits for hybrid 3 could have limited rumen degradation when fed as DRC. These data are similar to the VFA measurements taken in a previous study ( 2005 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 34-36) where propionate concentra - tions were the lowest for hybrid 3 (H- 9230Bt) when fed as DRC. Through high - moisture ensiling, these kernel traits were altered allowing for a greater increase in propionate con - centrations. The decrease in the A:P ratio from DRC to HMC for hybrids 1 and 3 were greater than the decrease for hybrid 2. The smaller decrease in the A:P ratio for hybrid 2 is due to the smaller change found for the con - centration of propionate when fed as HMC compared to DRC. A processing method by time inter - action ( P < 0.01) existed for molar % of propionate and the A:P ratio. Molar % of propionate for animals consum - ing DRC averaged 32.8% and did not change throughout the sampling day (data not shown). The molar % of propionate for animals consuming HMC were 34.6% prior to feeding and increased throughout the sampling day to 46.3% 12 hours after feeding. Nutrient digestibility data show hy - brid 1 maintained an advantage over hybrids 2 and 3 even though a more intense processing method was used. The differences found for total-tract nutrient digestibility and VFA con - centrations for hybrids fed as either DRC or HMC may have efficiency implications for hybrid selection and processing method. Producers feeding corn as DRC may want to consider selecting hybrids with larger, softer kernels. If a more intense processing method is used such as high-moisture ensiling, hybrid selection may not be as important. 1Matt technician; Galen Lincoln; Wayne Fithi - an, agronomy systems manager, Golden Harvest Seed Co., Waterloo, Neb.\u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

Jackson1 Summary Sixty commercially available corn hybrids were used to identify kernel traits that may be used as an indicator of feeding value to cattle. Three separate tests were conducted and 12 traits were evaluated for each hybrid. Most produc - tion traits were negatively correlated or not correlated to physical traits making them less indicative of cattle perfor - mance compared to some lab techniques. Based on the dry matter disappearance in the rumen, a harder kernel will be more efficiently digested. An approxi - mately 10% change in dry matter disap - pearance is shown between the most and least digestible hybrid. Physical kernel traits can be helpful in determining corn hybrids used for feeding cattle. Introduction A large amount of research has been devoted to corn processing and the feeding value of corn for feedlot cattle. Considerably less research has been conducted to see the effect of the corn hybrid type on feeding value. Chemical and physical traits of the corn kernel are similar within a hy - brid even across years, but can vary greatly among hybrids. Using seven commercially available corn hybrids, a feedlot trial showed differences are present and can influence cattle per - formance ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp.54 - 57). In that study many differ - ent factors were used to distinguish differences between these hybrids, using chemical and physical charac - teristics. In the following experiment many of these same tests, on 60 com - mercially available hybrids which had been entered in hybrid performance tests by the Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, were investigated. The objective of our experiment was to identify factors that would give an indication of feeding performance, al - low us to evaluate differences in feed - ing value present among corn hybrids, and determine if common grain mar - keting tests could distinguish those differences. Procedure Corn Production Sixty hybrids were grown in four field replicates and used to determine hybrid differences. At harvest, ap - proximately 2 lb of grain was collect - ed, placed in nylon bags, and stored dry. After approximately two months of storage, each sample was cleaned, by sieving, to obtain a sample of whole kernels for analysis. 1,000 Kernel Weight Following cleaning, 1,000 kernels were separated using an automated seed counter. Kernels were then weighed and a 1,000 kernel weight was recorded for each sample on an air-dry basis. A DM analysis was per - formed on each sample and the kernel weights were adjusted to a DM basis and represented the dry kernel weight. Stenvert Hardness Test Twenty grams of each whole corn sample were ground through a micro hammer mill. The softer particles grind first and fall to the bottom of the collection tube, while the harder particles grind slower and remained on top. The mill was attached to a tachometer which measured the revolutions per minute (rpm) of the machine. The machine started at 3600 RPM and the lowest RPM reached during grinding was recorded. A test tube placed at the bottom of the ma - chine collected the ground sample and was also used to determine the grinding time. The grinding time was the time from placing the whole sample into the machine until 17 mL, represented by a line on the tube, of ground sample was obtained. The total height of sample in the tube and height of the soft material were measured, after the entire sample was ground. The soft height was measured by identifying the change in color between the soft powder and the harder pericarp near the top of the tube. After these measures were taken, the ground sample was placed in a 425 mm sieve which was placed on a Strand shaker for three minutes. The hard pericarp remained on top of the screen and was weighed to determine the kernel =s hard percentage. In Situ Based on 1,000 kernel weight and Stenvert grinding, 20 hybrids were selected for an in situ trial to measure the dry matter disappearance (DMD) as an indication of feeding value. The 20 hybrids represented a range in ker - nel weights, as well as hard percentage and grinding time. The four replicates from each hybrid were ground using a Wiley Mill to simulate a masticate grind. After being ground, 5 g of each sample was weighed and placed in an in situ bag to be incubated. The sam - ples were replicated twice per animal per day, for a total of eight replications of each of the four field replications per hybrid. The procedure was con - ducted during a five day period using two ruminally cannulated steers, an incubation period of 24 hours, and one day between the two incubation periods. Upon removal of the bags from the steers, they were washed and placed in a 60o C oven for 48 hours to dry. After drying, each sample bag was weighed back to determine amount of residue left. The residue which remained was divided by the original sample, corrected for DM, to determine the DMD of each hybrid.

With a few exceptions, the production traits of yield and test weight had no correlation or were negatively corre - lated ( P < 0.05) to the Stenvert and in situ traits. Yield was correlated to the soft height and soft height percentage, (P = 0.04 and P < 0.01 respectively), but negatively correlated to dry kernel weight ( P = 0.02). Test weight (volume weight usually in lb/bu) was corre - lated to RPM ( P < 0.01), but was nega - tively correlated to total height, hard percentage, and 24 hour DMD ( P < 0.01, P < 0.01, and P = 0.02 respective - ly). These observations would seem to suggest that our most common market time quality measurement, test weight, is not related to laboratory tests which correlate with the feeding value of the corn. An important ob - servation is an insignificant negative correlation ( P = 0.22) was observed between test weight and kernel weight. Previous studies ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp.54-57), have shown a posi - tive correlation between kernel weight and feeding performance. This sug - gests that higher weight kernels result in better performance. However since test weight is based on density more than solid weight, these two measures do not result in similar relationships to feeding performance. Revolutions per minute was the only Stenvert observation that had a correlation with the in situ procedure. RPM was negatively correlated to the DMD ( P < 0.01), which indicates a hybrid with a harder kernel has a higher DMD. These data are contrary to previ - ous data. Previous studies indicated softer kernels have a higher DMD compared to harder kernels ( 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp.32-34; and 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 54-57). Another current study ( 2006 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 45-47) also indicates that a softer kernel is more digestible though the relationship between the two was rather weak (r = 0.27). The overall change in DMD between the highest and lowest percentage was 9.33 %, which indicates that although the hybrids were chosen using some extremes from the Stenvert and 1,000 kernel weight data, overall differences in feeding value were less than 10%.

Harrelson Galen E. Erickson T erry J. Klopfenstein W ayne A Fithian Patrick M. Clark David S. Jackson1 Summary Seventy-two commercially available corn hybrids were used to quantify the existing range in kernel characteris - tics shown to correlate with improved feeding value to cattle. Twelve hybrids were steam flaked at two different bulk densities. Hybrids were tested for kernel size, hardness, in situ digestibility, and starch use. For dry rolled corn, a 27% difference in dry matter disappearance was found across hybrids. For flaking, a 6% to 29% improvement over dry rolled corn was observed. An 8% to 36% advantag e for flaking in starch digest - ibility was also found. The results of this trial suggest there can be an interaction between hybrid value and whether fed as dry-rolled or steam-flaked corn. Introduction Recent research has begun to explore corn hybrid testing as an importan t way to improve cattle performance in the feedlot. Previ - ous hybrid testing data showed how corn hybrid interacts with processing methods. A previous study comparing dry rolled corn with high moisture corn ( 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 32-34) illustrated that a harder (flinty) endosperm had improved performance when processed as high moisture corn compared with dry rolled corn. Another study using HMC ( 2006 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 40-42) indicates that processing corn hybrids can increase the feed - ing performance of harder kernels. Evaluating hybrids when processed differently is critical because some poorer performing hybrids fed as dry rolled corn, may be greatly improved when fed as steam flaked corn. Our objective for the first trial was to iden - tify kernel traits that indicate feeding value and how these traits are influ - enced by hybrid as dry rolled corn. Our objective for the second trial was to identify how hybrid kernel charac - teristics affect the flaking process and feeding value of the resulting flakes. Procedure Dry Corn Trial Whole grain samples of 72 com - mercially available corn hybrids were used for Stenvert Hardness tests and in situ analysis. A duplicate analysis was run for the Stenvert Hardness test (procedure detailed in 2006 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 43-44) since only one sample of each hybrid was present. After the Stenvert analysis, 24 hybrids were selected for in situ analysis to include a wide range of kernel char - acteristics. A sample of each hybrid was ground through the Wiley Mill to simulate a masticate grind for the in situ analysis. This grind produces a particle size equivalent to a masti - cated, rolled corn. A 10 g sample of ground corn was weighed and placed in an in situ bag for incubation. Each hybrid was replicated six times in two ruminally cannulated steers using an incubation period of 24 hours. After the incubation period each sample was removed, machine washed using five three minute cycles, and placed in a 60oC oven to dry for 48 hours after which it was weighed and dry matter disappearance (DMD) was calculated. Feed value was measured for each hybrid using an in situ pro- cedure; disappearance was correlated with measured kernel traits. Correla - tion results were compared to previ - ous investigations comparing kernel characteristics with feed efficiency us - ing in situ disappearance and a feedlot pen study.Steam Flaked Corn Trial Twelve hybrids, which were used in the dry corn in situ trial, were sent to the Department of Grain Science and Industry =s Feed Processing Center at Kansas State University (KSU), Man - hattan, Kan., to determine the hybrid effect on flaking characteristics. Characteristics measured included: bulk density at two levels (light and heavy, 27 lb/bu and 32 lb/bu, respec - tively); electrical consumption of the steam flaking motor to determine kilowatt hours/ton (kWh/ton); and production rates. Corn hybrids were steam flaked on a Roskamp flaker equipped with a 25 HP motor and 16@x 12@(diameter x width) rolls at 16 grooves/in. A 12 @x15@x72@ stain - less steel steam chamber was used to steam condition all corn before entering the flaking rolls. The feeder was set at a constant rate to allow for any electrical differences to be mea - sured. For the drive motor, voltage and amperag e across each electrical phase was measured using a record - ing volt-amp meter (Model DM-II Pro, Amprobe, Miami, FL). Electrical consumption was determined by rela - tive (gross) and specific (net) energy. Gross energy was defined as the total amount of energy required while the machine was used under a load. Net energy was defined as the energy require d to operate the machine un - der a load, minu s the energy required to operate the machine empty. Reten - tion time of the corn in the steam chest before flaking was eight minutes with a steam conditioning tempera - ture of 98.8 \u00b0C (210 \u00b0F) for all corn hybrids. After the flaking was conducted at KSU, approximately 30 lb of each hybrid and flake density (n=24) were returned for in situ analysis. The sample s were placed in feed bags to cool and dry to prevent spoilage before being shipped. A sub sample Page 46 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved.of the 24 samples was ground in the Wiley Mill without a screen. For the in situ procedure each hybrid was tested as ground dry corn, whole flaked corn, and ground flaked corn. Each flake density for each hybrid was analyzed to compare the densities; as well as flaking versus dry corn. A 5 g sample was placed in an in situ bag for incubation. Each sample was replicat - ed in each of two animals per day over two days (eight total bags), with an incubation period of 24 hours. Starch analysis was conducted on the origi - nal unincubated samples, and the in situ residue samples which were com - posited across animals within days. Results Dry Corn Trial A wide range was observed within each kernel trait across hybrid (Table 1). Production related traits of 1,000 kernel weight and test weight were correlated (P < 0.05) to each other and to a few of the Stenvert observations. Kernel weight was negatively correlat - ed (P < 0.01) to test weight, ind i cating that a higher volume weight does not necessarily indicate heavier kernels. Test weight was positively correlated to the Stenvert grind time (P < 0.01), which indicates that a higher volume weight causes the sample to grind slower. Dry matter digestibility is believed to be the best measure of value to the hybrid for finishing cattle. Therefore, kernel traits that relate to DMD are of primary interest. Test weight was the only kernel trait cor - related to DMD (P = 0.07) and the relationship was not strong (r = 0.4). Previous research showed that softer kernels were more digestible based on Stenvert soft height percentage. The relationship (r = 0.27) between DMD and the percentage soft particles in the kernel was weak and not signifi - cant (P = 0.27). We can contrast some findings from this study with the feedlot trial from 2004. In that trial the relationship (r = 0.85) between gain:feed and soft height percentage was strong and would directly relate to feedlot performance. We did not use these hybrids in a feedlot trial, but did use DMD as an equivalent mea - sure for this analysis. It is also impor - tant to note that our in situ process is designed to mimic what would occur in a feedlot; however, we are only test - ing a small amount of feed, and for a short period, so though helpful, it cannot be evaluated on the same scale as a feedlot trial. Steam Flaking Characteristics Flaked corn production rates fluctuated by corn hybrid (Table 2). Although there were differences in the production rates, an adjustment was made when calculating kWh/ton to accurately assess the effect of hybrid on kWh/ton. As expected, there was a difference in kWh/ton between light and heavy flakes. The steam flaker consumed more electricity as flaking became more rigorous in creating a lighter flake. There also appeared to be differences among hybrids within each bulk density treatment. For exampl e , hybrid 8700 had an electri - cal consumption of 2.243 kWh/ton and hybrid 9164 had an electrical consumption of 3.258 kWh/ton. This is a difference of 1.1 kWh/ton. A feedlot with 4 flakers operating at 50 ton/hour each, operating 16 hours/day and six days a week, at a $0.07/kW charge has a potential savings of $1,478.40 per week in electrical costs. Replications were not conducted, so statistical differences could not be calculated. Dry Matter Disappearance A comparison of the mean dry matter disappearances between dry rolled corn and steam-flaked corn is shown in Table 3. Since no effect of grinding on the flakes was present, data are pooled and reported on the basis of bulk density and compared to the dry rolled corn samples for each hybrid. There was a hybrid* process - ing interaction (P < 0.01) for DMD. The bulk densities of flakes (P < 0.01) T able 1. Kernel characteristics of 72 single replicate Golden Harvest hybrids.

This observation suggests that harder kernels perform better when processed as steam flaked corn than when fed as dry-rolled corn. Clearly, hybrids responded differently to flak - ing. The range in DMD values for DRC is 10.9 percentage units. The range in DMD for light flakes was 11.8 percentage units. This information could be very useful in identifying hybrid s for feeders with steam flakers. Starch Digestibility Hybrid starch digestibility for DRC, light flakes, and heavy flakes is represented in Table 4, with the means being 52.6%, 66.5%, and 63.8% respectivel y . A lighter flake resulted in a significantly higher (P < 0.01) digestibility. There was a significant hybrid*process interaction (P < 0.01) as was also seen with DMD. The ranking of hybrid efficiency changed somewhat, however a strong relation - ship (r = 0.79) between DMD and starch digestibility still exists. Hybri d 8562, which in previous studies had been a good performing hybrid, showed some interesting properties in the flaking trial. It was the only hybrid in which the starch digestibility of the DRC, light, and heavy flakes were not significantly different. 1 Flint W. Harrelson, graduate student; Galen E.

The lighter flakes were also more digestible than the dry rolled corn (P < 0.01), which sup - ports performance data on comparing flaked corn with DRC.

Erickson Matt A. Greenquist T erry J. Klopfenstein Thomas Robb 1 Summary An experiment evaluated the effect s of six corn processing methods in feedlot diets containing 30% (DM basis) wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS). Treatments consisted of whole corn, dry - rolled corn, a dry - rolled/ high- moistur e corn mix, high - moisture corn, steam flaked corn, and fine ground corn. The ADG was highest for steers receiving dry - rolled corn, high - moisture corn, or a 50:50 blend of dry - rolled and high - moisture corn. Feed con - version was best for steers receiving high- moisture corn. Interestingly, cattle fed finely ground corn or steam - flaked corn did not gain or convert as well as expected. Results indicate that there is a performance advantage obtained by processing corn as either dry - rolled or high - moistur e when included with WDGS in finishing diets. Introduction Recently, the increased availability of wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) has led to a greater number of feedlot producers and nutritionists incorporating this feed into finish - ing diets. According to past research, incorporatin g WDGS into feedlot diets results in better performance, with optimum feed conversion observe d when included between 30% and 40% of the diet (DM basis); (Vander Pol et al., 2006 Nebraska Beef Report ). Steam - flaked corn is 12% and high - moisture corn is 2% higher in energy than dry - rolled corn (Cooper et al., 2001 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 54-57). However, in diets containing wet corn gluten feed, high - moisture corn is 8% higher in energy and steam - flaked corn is 14% higher in energy than dry - rolled corn based on feed conversion (Macken et al., 2003 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 25 - 27). The objective of this trial was to determine effects of six different corn processing methods as the primary concentrate in diets containing 30% WDGS (DM basis) on feedlot perfor - mance and carcass characteristics of finishing calf - fed steers. Procedure Three - hundred sixty large - framed, crossbred (British x Continental) steer calves (BW = 701 34 lb) were used in a completely randomized design. Upon arrival to the feedlot, steers were identified, vaccinated, and weaned on smooth bromegrass pas - tures for approximately three weeks. Five days before the initiation of this trial, steers were limit fed a diet con - sisting of 50% wet corn gluten feed and 50% alfalfa hay (DM basis) at 2% of BW. Steers were weighed individu - ally on day 0 and day 1 to obtain an accurate initial BW, and all steers were implanted with Synovex - C (Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA ). Utilizing BW obtained on day 0, steers were stratified by weight and assigned randomly to pen (10 steers/pen). Pen was assigned randomly to dietary treatment and served as the experi - mental unit. The overall experimental design used six dietary treatments which were replicated six times, for a total of 36 feedlot pens. The six dietary treatments (Table 1) consisted of six different corn processing methods or combinations fed at 62% of diet DM, which were: whole corn (WC), dry - rolled corn (DRC), dry - rolled/high - moisture corn fed at a 1:1 ratio DM basis (DRC:HMC), high - moisture corn (HMC), steam - flaked corn (SFC), and fine - ground (FGC). Basal dietary ingredients consisted of 30% WDGS, 5% alfalfa hay fed, and 3% dry meal supplement (DM basis). Dry mat - ter determinations were conducted weekly on all ingredients by drying samples in a 60o C forced air oven for 48-hr. Diets were formulated to meet or exceed the NRC (1996) require - ments for metabolizable protein, Ca, and K. Step - up procedure consisted of a 21-day period and four steps fed for 3, 4, 7, and 7 days, respectively, where corn replaced alfalfa hay starting at T able 1.

After 107 days on the finishing diet, alfalfa hay was increased to 7.5% of diet DM and corn reduced to 59.5% of diet DM. Steers were fed once daily at 0830 by means of a single axle truck equipped with a Roto - Mix7 model 420 ( Roto - Mix7, Dodge City, Kan. ) mixer/delivery box. Steers were re - implanted on day 66 with Revalor - S7 (Intervet, Mills - boro, Del. ) and fed for a total of 168 days. Befor e shipping, all pens were weighed separately on a pen scale to determine final live weight and dressing pe r centage. All final live weight values were shrunk 4%. Steers were slaughtered on day 169 at a commercial packing plant ( Greater Omaha Pack, Omaha, Neb. ) where hot carcass weights and liver scores were recorde d . Following a 48 - hour chill, fat thickness/preliminary yield grades, ribeye areas, kidney pelvic heart fat percentages, and USDA called marbling scores were recorded. Yield grade was calculated using the equation (YG=2.50 + (2.5*FT, in.) - (0.32*REA, in2) + (0.2*KPH, %) + (0.0038*HCW, lb.)) published in the Meat Industry Handbook. Carcass adjusted final body weight, ADG and feed:gain were calculated using hot carcass weight divided by an aver - age dressing percentage of 63, which was done to minimize error associ - ated with gastrointestinal fill, and to provide an accurate estimate of indi - vidual final body weight. With the exception of the SFC, all corn used was produced from the same seed - corn hybrid (Pioneer 33B51, Pioneer Hybrid International, Johnston, IA ) and grown in simi - lar fields under irrigation to reduce the effect of corn hybrid on feed - ing performance. Dry-rolled corn was processed through a single-roll roller mill. Fine-ground corn was processed through a hammermill to pass through a 0.95-cm screen. High- moisture corn was harvested in one day at approximately 32% moisture and ensiled in a plastic silo bag for a minimum of 55-days before air expo - sure. Steam - flaked corn was produced at a commercial feedlot ( Mead Cattle Company, Mead, Neb. ), targeted a flake density of 26 lb/bushel, and delivere d bi-weekly. Wet distillers grains plus solubles were procured from a commercial ethanol plant (Abengoa Bioenergy, York, Neb. ), and delivered on an as needed basis to the research facility (approximately 1X/ week). Based on information obtained from the ethanol plant, the ratio of distillers grains to distillers solubles was 65:35 (DM basis) and contained on average; 32.6% DM, 30.6% CP, and 12.0% crude fat. Data were analyzed using the mixed procedures of SAS ( Version 9.1, SAS Inc., Cary, N.C. ) as a completely randomized design, with pen serving as the experimental unit. Results Cattle receiving the DRC or WC treatments had significantly higher DMI than cattle receiving the FGC, SFC, HMC, and DRC:HMC treat - ments (Table 2, P < 0.05). The ADG was highest ( P < 0.05) for cattle fed DRC, HMC, and 50:50 DRC:HMC treatments. Feed:gain, was lowest for cattle receiving the HMC treatment and highest for cattle re - ceiving the FGC treatment ( P < 0.05). Cattle receiving the HMC treatment (Continued on next page)Page 50 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved.had better ( P < 0.05) feed:gain ratio than cattle fed FGC, SFC, and WC treatments, with a trend ( P = 0.09) for the HMC treatment to be better than the DRC treatment (5.46 vs 5.68). The HMC treatment was lower in feed conversion because of lower DMI and similar ADG relative to the DRC treatment. Liver abscess score (Table 3) was not different among treatments ( P = 0.47) which can potentially indicate cattle did not experience a higher incidence of acidosis due to differ - ent corn processing methods, or that Tylan7 inclusion controlled abscesses. Cattle with the least amount of 12th rib fat were on the FGC treatment, which measured 0.45 in, which indi - cates that regardless of dietary treat - ment, cattle achieved a minimum fat thickness indicative of adequate finish. Fat thickness was greatest for cattle receiving the DRC treatment (0.62 in), which was greater ( P < 0.05) than cattle on the FGC, SFC, WC, and DRC:HMC treatments.Ribeye area was not different among treatments ( P = 0.16), how - ever, marbling score was significantly different ( P < 0.01). Cattle receiving the HMC treatment had the highest marbling score (544) while cattle on the FGC and SFC treatments had the lowest ( P < 0.05). There were no significant differ - ences ( P = 0.07) among treatments for percentage of cattle grading USDA Choice or better. However, only 6.7% of cattle on the SFC treatment graded upper 2/3 Choice or better, which was lower than every other treatment except the FGC treatment. Cattle receiving the DRC treatment had a significantly higher ( P < 0.05) calcu - lated yield grade than cattle receiving the FGC, SFC, HMC, and DRC:HMC treatments. The carcass characteris - tics support the performance data, with cattle fed FGC and SFC being less finished and lower in fat than the other treatments. In summary, high concentrate finishing diets containing 30% (DM basis) WDGS are influenced by corn processing method. More specifically, cattle fed 30% WDGS and DRC yield - ed higher final body weights, ADG, fat thickness, KPH, and calculated yield grade than cattle fed 30% WDGS and either FGC, fed 30% WDGS and HMC as the concentrate source yielded better feed conversion, and higher marbling scores than cattle fed the same amount of WDGS and either FGC, SFC, DRC:HMC, DRC, or WC. Overall, WDGS is an excellent feed ingredient for finishing diets. It appears that steam - flaking and fine grinding or not processing corn at all (whole corn) are not as favorable as dry- rolling and high - moisture corn processing methods in diets contain - ing 30% WDGS. 1Kyle J.

V ander Pol Galen E. Erickson T erry J. Klopfenstein Matt A. Greenquist Thomas Robb 1 Summary An experiment evaluated the effects of six dietary inclusions of wet distillers grain plus solubles (WDGS) on feedlot performance and carcass characteristics of yearling steers, and also evaluated the energy value of WDGS relative to corn. Treatments consisted of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% (DM basis) dietary inclusion of WDGS. Final BW, DMI, and ADG increased quadratically, while feed: gain decreased quadratically as WDGS inclusion increased from 0 to 50% of DM. No differences in carcass character - istics were observed among treatments. Energ y value of WDGS relative to corn was above 100% for all inclusion levels and decrease d (178 to 121%) as dietary WDGS inclusion increased, (10 to 50% of DM). Results indicate that WDGS can be used effectively in finishing di - ets, with optimum performance being observe d at 30 to 40% dietary inclusion. Introduction As the U.S. ethanol industry con - tinues to expand, the availability of by-products generated from milling processes will increase. It is estimated that in 2005, U.S. production of fuel grade ethanol may reach 4 billion gallons and will continue to grow. Therefore, it appears that there is a tremendous opportunity for cattle feeders to take advantage of and use these by-products in their current operations. Along with the positive avail - ability of distillers by-products, past research has indicated a higher energy value of feeding distillers by-products compared to dry-rolled corn when fed to cattle. However, the higher energy value appears to be inclusion level dependen t and the response is variable. Therefore, knowing that the potentia l exists to use more wet distillers by-products in feedlot diets than what is currently being used opens up an avenue that many nutri - tionists, and ethanol companies are interested in. The objective of this trial was to determine the effects of increasing dieta r y inclusion of wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) on feed - lot performance and carcass charac - teristics of finishing yearling steers, and to determine the energy value of WDGS relative to a high-moisture/ dry-rolled corn combination as level of WDGS increases from 0 to 50% (DM basis) in 10% increments. Procedure A 126-day finishing trial used 288 crossbred yearling steers (BW = 773 24 lb) with predominately British breed influences in a completely ran - domized design. Five days before the initiation of the trial, steers were limit fed a high fiber ration consisting of a 1:1 ratio (DM basis) of alfalfa hay and wet corn gluten feed at 2.0% of BW. Steers were weighed individually on day 0 and day 1, to obtain an accurate initial weight, and poured with Elec - tor (Elanco Animal Health, Green - field, IN) on d 1. Steers were stratified by weight, and assigned randomly to pen (eight steers/pen). Pen was assigne d randomly a dietary treat - ment and served as the experimental unit. In total there were six treatments and six replications/treatment, result - ing in 36 pens. The six dietary treatments (Table 1) consisted of a control (CON) with all included in the ration as a percentage of DM. Alfalfa hay was in - cluded in all diets at 5.0% of DM, and high-moisture corn (HMC) and dry- rolled corn (DRC) were fed at a 1:1 ratio (DM basis). WDGS replaced this blend of HMC:DRC so all diets had a constant ratio of HMC to DRC. Dry matter determinations were conduct - ed weekly on all ingredients by drying samples in a 60o C forced air oven for 48 hours. Diets were formulate d to meet or exceed the NRC (1996) requirement s for metabolizable pro - tein, Ca, and K. Dietary adaptation consisted of a step-up procedure where alfalfa hay replaced corn start - ing at 45% of DM, and was reduced by 10%, with the step durations being 3, 4, 7, and 7 days, for steps 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Steers were fed once daily at 0800 by means of a single axle truck equipped with a Roto-Mix7 model 420 ( Roto-Mix7, Dodge City, Kan. ) mixer/delivery box. Steers were implanted on day 28 with Revalor-S7 (Intervet, Millsboro, DE). Dietary ingredients were sam - pled once weekly, analyzed for DM (AOAC,1965), frozen, composited by month, and analyzed for N and ash (AOAC, 1965). Steers were slaughtered on day 127 at a commercial abattoir ( Tyson Fresh Meats, West Point, NE ). Hot carcass weight and liver scores were recorded on day of slaughter. Ribeye area and fat thickness were measured after a 24-hour chill. Further, marbling score and yield grade were called by a trained USDA grader. Final BW, ADG, and feed efficiency were calculated based on hot carcass weights adjusted to a common dressing percentage of 63. This was done to minimize error associated with gut fill, and to provide an accurate estimate of final weight. The energy value of each level (Continued on next page)Page 52 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved.of WDGS (Table 2) was calculated usin g feed efficiency. The difference between each WDGS treatment and the CON was calculated, divided by the feed efficiency value of the CON treatment, as well as the percentage of WDGS in the corresponding diet to give an energy value of WDGS relative to the CON treatment (see Table 2). Wet distillers grains plus solubles were produced at a commercial etha - nol plant ( Abengoa Bioenergy, York, NE), and delivered once weekly to the research facility. Based on informa - tion obtained from the ethanol plant, the ratio of distillers grains to distill - ers solubles was 65:35 (DM basis), and contained on average; 32.6% DM, 30.6% CP, and 12.0% crude fat. Data were analyzed using the mixed procedures of SAS ( Version 9.1, SAS Inc., Cary, NC ) as a completely randomized design, with pen as the experimental unit. Orthogonal con - trasts were used to test significance for the highest order polynomial. Results Performance and carcass vari - ables are presented in Table 2. Carcass adjusted final body weight followed a significant ( P < 0.01) qua - dratic increas e as WDGS inclusion increase d . Similarly, DMI increased quadratically ( P < 0.01) as WDGS inclusion increased, with cattle on the 30DG treatment achieving the highest intake. Additionally, ADG increased quadratically (Figure 1) as WDGS inclusion increased from 0 to 50% of DM, with cattle fed the 30DG having the highest ADG. Feed conversion followed a significant ( P < 0.01) qua - dratic decrease (Figure 1) as WDGS inclusion increased from 0 to 50% of the diet. However, optimum feed conversion was achieved when WDGS was incorporated into the diet at 40% of DM. Calculated energy value of WDGS relative to HMC/DRC, resulted in energ y values greater than 100% regardless of WDGS inclusion. The 10DG treatment yielded the highest energy value relative to corn, and the overall response was a significant T able 1.

Because of the DMI response and maximum DMI observed at 30% WDGS, ADG increased as WDGS increased to 30%. However, ADG was similar for cattle fed either 30 or 40% WDGS. Therefore, for optimum (lowest) feed conversion, 40% WDGS should be used. Further, regardless of dietary inclusion, cattle fed WDGS achieved similar carcass characteris - tics as cattle not fed WDGS. 1 Kyle J. Vander Pol, research technician; Galen E.

Mark 1 Summary An economic analysis was conducted using feedlot performance, current feed ingredient prices, trucking, and cost of feeding inputs to determine economics of feeding wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) at five dietary inclusions. The analysis also incorporated positive corn basis into the model. Cattle returns are greatest when incorporated WDGS is fed at 30 to 40% of DM at feedlots located between 0 and 60 miles from the plant. As distance of the feedlot increases from 60 to 100 miles from the plant, opti - mum inclusion is between 20 and 30% of dietar y DM. Either a 5 or 10 cent positive corn basis decreases net returns on cattle by approximately $2 for each $0.05 increase in corn bushel price, but optimum inclusion amounts do not change based on distance from the plant. Results indicate more than just the cost of the product influence the economics of feeding WDGS. Introduction It is well documented that incor - porating wet distillers grains plus soluble s (WDGS) into feedlot diets yields energy values greater than corn (Ham et al., 1994 Nebraska Beef Repor t, pp. 38 - 40; Vander Pol et al., 2006 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 51-53). As a resul t , WDGS popularity has increase d especially in close proxim - ity to ethanol plants. Anothe r contrib - uting factor leading to increased use is the rapid expansion of the ethanol industr y , resulting in a relatively stable price. The energy value of WDGS relative to corn is 120 to 180% depending on inclusion amount of 10 to 50% of diet DM (Vander Pol et al., 2006 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 51-53). However, WDGS is typically priced at 90 to 95% the price of corn at the ethanol plant. Therefore, the relatively high value compared to price has encour - aged WDGS use by feedlots. However, WDGS is a relatively wet product, with average DM between 30 and 35%. WDGS typically replaces corn in feedlot diets. Due to the higher mois - ture content, the price is presumably greater to deliver WDGS to the bunk compared to corn. Therefore, in order for WDGS feeding to be profitable, the higher energy value associated with WDGS has to be able to make up for the increase in deliver y cost at the bunk associated with feeding WDGS relative to corn. Therefore, the objectives of this researc h were to determine the eco - nomic benefit of feeding WDGS relative to feeding a typical high con - centrate corn based finishing diet. Energy value, inclusion rate, distance from the plant, increased feeding cost and corn price sensitivity impact on the economics were also evaluated. Procedure Performance Inputs Twenty - one treatment means from 11 published research trials conducted in Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska that involved feeding WDGS across a range of inclusions from 10 to 50% of DM were compared to develop an equation to predict the energy response (energy relative to corn) of feeding WDGS compared to corn. Because the energy value changes with inclusion amount, an equation was developed and was a linear rela - tionship of y = - 0.84x + 164.2 (R2 = 0.28), where x equals percentage di - etary inclusion of WDGS and y is the energy value relative to corn. For the economic modeling, inclusions of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% (DM basis) were evaluated. The energy value of WDGS rela - tive to corn for all 21 treatment means used was calculated utilizing feed efficienc y values from each treat - ment comparison. The equation was based on comparing the WDGS treatment to that experiment's con - trol performance. Therefore, WDGS energy valu e relative to corn was cal - culated as: ((WDGS feed efficiency - control feed efficiency)/control feed efficiency)/WDGS inclusion (DM basis). Therefore, using a published control value (Vander Pol et al., 2006 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 51-53) and calculated energy values for each inclusio n level, allowed calculation of an adjusted feed efficiency value for each of the five WDGS inclusions. For ADG, one data set was used that evaluated all the theoretical inclusion s of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% (Vander Pol et al., 2006 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 51-53). The observed quadratic ADG equation as WDGS increase d was used to develop an ADG prediction equation across WDGS inclusion levels. The equation was y = - 0.0007x2 + 0.04x + 3.66 (R2 = 0.91), where x equals dietary inclusion of WDGS and y equals pre - dicted ADG at that inclusion. Usin g this equation and the five WDGS inclusion s to be evaluated (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% of DM) allowed calculation of an adjusted ADG for each inclusion. The estimate for DMI was calculated using adjusted ADG divide d by adjusted feed efficiency. After adjusted ADG values were determined for each inclusion, these values were used to determine the number of days on feed a typical feedlot animal would need to be fed to achieve the same final body weight as a feedlot animal fed 0% WDGS for 153 days. For example, the control cattle gained 3.66 lb/d for 153 days (560 lb). Because cattle fed WDGS have greater ADG, less days are require d to gain 560 lb. Therefore, days on feed were necessary for yard - age calculations, and for appropriate DMI at each inclusion amount. Feed Ingredient Prices and Return WDGS are typically priced betwee n 90 and 95% the price of corn at the plant, therefore, we assumed WDGS was priced at 95% of the corn \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved. 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 55 Trucking costs at the time of analy - sis were assumed to be $2.50/loaded mile based on a 25 ton (as is) load. Since all feedlots are not immediately adjacent to the ethanol plant, we evaluated the economics for a feedlot 0, 30, 60, and 100 miles from the etha - nol plant. The cost of feeding WDGS in feed - lots is greater than corn since WDGS has a much higher moisture content relative to corn, and there is a cost as - sociated with hauling wet feed (more total weight) to a given feedlot pen. Therefore, we assumed the cost of feeding 0% WDGS was approximately 1/4 of yardage ($0.32/steer/d) giving a cost of feeding of $13.00 for a control (corn only) steer for 153 days. The increased feeding cost would account for equipment, labor, fuel, etc. To calculate the increase in feeding cost for diets utilizing WDGS we multi - plied the percentage increase in as - fed amount of feed hauled to a pen by the $13.00 cost of feeding 0% WDGS for each WDGS inclusion we evaluated. Results The increased costs of feeding WDGS at five inclusions, adjusted days on feed, and corresponding yard - age adjustments are presented Table 1. Days on feed, which are derived using the ADG values calculated for the five different dietary inclusions follows a quadratic pattern as dietary inclusion increases. Days on feed is lowest for cattle fed 30% WDGS (130 days), and highest for cattle fed 10% WDGS (139 days) assuming control cattle are fed 153 days. The reduced days on feed equates to a savings of $7.25 for an animal fed 30% WDGS. As mentioned previously, the cost of feeding a diet containing 0% WDGS for 153 days (153 days = industry aver - age) is estimated to be $13.00 per ani - mal. Because WDGS is a relatively wet product, the cost of feeding increases from $13.86/hd at a 10% inclusion, to $19.06/hd at a 50% dietary inclusion.

Prices for corn and alfalfa hay were 10-year averages, equating to $2.30/bushel and $54.54/ton, respectively ( www. feuzmarketanalysis.com ). Current prices at the time of analysis were utilized for other basal ingredients, which were primarily micro ingredi - ents totaling 5% of DM, or typical of a dry supplement. Returns ($/hd) for feeding a steer 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50% WDGS relative to a steer fed 0% WDGS (i.e., 80% corn alone) for 153 days were calcu - lated by determining the break even price of WDGS, or the price you could pay for WDGS when profits were equivalent to the control cattle. This was the cost of the control diet minus the cost of the basal ingredients in the five different WDGS diets divided by the amount (ton equivalent) of WDGS used in that diet. The differ - ence between the break even cost and actual cost of WDGS for the amount of WDGS fed determined the $/head return for WDGS at each of the five dietary inclusions. Corn Basis, Trucking Cost, Distance from the Plant, and Feeding Costs It has been postulated that the presence of an ethanol plant will increas e the demand for corn within close proximity of the plant, thus increasin g the basis (cash price minus futures price) of corn in the immedi - ate area. To account for this potential increase in corn price, price was in - creased either 0, 5, or 10 cents/bushel at the plant. Given these scenarios, and WDGS priced at 95% that of corn, a positive corn basis at the plant would result in a higher price paid for WDGS and corn remaining in the diet. In addition, a sensitivity component was included in the model to deter m ine at what price feeding WDGS is more or less profitable. Input s for this component were $1.80, $2.30, and $2.80/bushel corn at the plant.(Continued on next page)Page 56 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved.100 miles from the plant are presented in Table 2. These results suggest that feedlots at or near the plant have the greatest economic advantage to use a 40% WDGS dietary inclusion. However, as distance from the plant increases to 30 miles, the return is highest for WDGS inclusions between 30 and 40%. The economic optimum inclusion is decreased as the distance from the plant reaches 100 miles. Between 60 and 100 miles from the ethanol plant it is most economically favorable to utilize between a 20 and 30% dietary inclusion of WDGS. Data evaluating a 5 cent/bushel positive corn basis at the ethanol plant are presented in Table 3. As with the ten-year average corn price, a 5 cent/bushel increase in corn price favors a 40% WDGS inclusion at or near the plant. At a distance up to 30 miles away the economic advantage of feeding WDGS is highest between a 30 and 40% inclusion. As distance from the plant and subsequent truck - ing cost increase up to 100 miles away from the plant, the economic advan - tage to feeding WDGS is highest be - tween 20 and 30% dietary inclusion. If corn basis at the ethanol plant is increased to 10 cent/bushel, the trends for the economic optimum inclusions do not change (Table 4). However, the overall return above cattle fed a conventional corn diet is decreased compared to a $0.05 basis or 0 basis. Therefore, as corn basis increases with ethanol plant construction, there is a lower return than if the plant had no impact on corn price. However, even if corn price increases, the feedlot has larger net returns with WDGS than without the by-product feed. The only scenario that is negative return was feeding 50% WDGS at a feedlot 100 miles from the ethanol plant. Further, the sensitivity analysis using either $1.80, $2.30, or $2.80/bushel corn generated similar trends as the corn basis data. A key to these results is the conventional corn comparison is cheaper because this assumes the ethanol plant was not built. Therefore, both the corn and the WDGS (priced relative to corn) are higher priced. A primary driver for the use of WDGS in finishing diets has been the improved feed efficiency associ - ated with the product. From an eco - nomic standpoint, it appears that the improved feed efficiency drives the economic advantage when using the product at specific levels. However, certain scenarios such as increased trucking and feeding costs can signifi - cantly reduce the economic benefit associated with the use of WDGS. It is important also to note that feed - ing a product high in moisture and phosphorus can impact the costs associate d with shrink and manure handling which were not evaluated in this model. Other research (Kissinger et al., 2006 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 94-97) evaluating the cost of man - aging feedlot manure phosphorus suggest that the cost of handling the additional manur e phosphorus gener - ated by feeding by-products such as WDGS is roughly $0.75 to $1.00/hd going from 0 to 30 or 40% DM inclu - sion. In conclusion feedlot managers and nutritionists should evaluate more than just the price of WDGS when determining an optimum di - etary inclusion level. Based on these results, it appears that returns have been good for feedlots in close prox - imity to ethanol plants using wet by-products. The performance data, along with these economic data, suggest that up to 40% WDGS (DM basis) can be fed, which is probably more than is commonly used today. 1Kyle J.

Klopfenstein Matthew L. Gibson Kyle J. V ander Pol Matthew A. Greenquist1 Summary An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of level of a low pro - tein distillers by-product, Dakota Bran Cake (DBRAN), on feedlot performance and carcass characteristics of yearling steers. Diets contained 0, 15, 30, 45% DBRAN, or 30% dried distillers grains plus solubles (DDGS), replacing corn (DM basis). Final BW, ADG, and F:G improved linearly and daily DMI had a quadratic positive response as level of DBRAN in the diet increased. With the exception of HCW, there were no significant differences for carcass char - acteristics. The DBRAN had feeding performance similar to DDGS at the same inclusion level. Feeding DBRAN in this trial, up to 45% of the diet, resulted in improved performance compared to feeding high-moisture/dry-rolled corn, suggesting DBRAN has 100 - 108% of the energy value of corn. Introduction The growing ethanol industry is continually developing innovative ways to increase ethanol production and, in turn, market by-products derive d from the milling process. Feeding some by-products as a signifi - cant portion of dietary intake presents challenges with managing various nutrient concentrations in the feed. Dakota Bran Cake (DBRAN) contains less highly fermentable starch than corn and lower levels of protein than other by-product feeds. Although DBRAN shows potential for wide - spread feedlot use based on composi - tion analysis, animal performance of the product has not been evaluated.The objectives of this research trial were to determine the effect of level of DBRAN on feedlot performance and carcass characteristics and to calculate the energy value of DBRAN relative to corn in feedlot cattle. Procedure Three hundred crossbred long yearling steers (BW = 837 + 44 lb) were used in a randomized complete block design experiment. Dietar y treatments (Table 1) consisted of 0, 15, 30, and 45 % DBRAN and 30% dried distillers grains plus solubles (DDGS), replacing corn (DM basis ) . Basal ingredients consisted of high- moisture corn and dry-rolled corn, fed at a constant 1:1 ratio (DM basis ) , plus ground alfalfa hay and dry supplement each fed at 5% of diet (DM basis). Rumensin\u00ae, thiamine, and Tylan\u00ae were fed at a rate of 320, 140, and 90 mg/head/day, respectivel y . Steers were weighed for two consecu - tive days (day 0 and day 1) to deter - mine initial weight following a 5-day limit feeding period. The weights from day 0 were used to assign the cattle. Steers were blocked by weight into three blocks, stratified by weight within block, and assigned randomly to pen. Pens were assigned randomly to treatment within block with five pens per treatment and 12 steers per pen. The steers were implanted with Revalor-S\u00ae at the end of the step-up phase on day 21. In addition, one steer was removed from trial due to poor health unrelated to the study. Steers were fed for 116 days and slaughtered on day 117 at a commercial abattoir (Greater Omaha Pack, Omaha, Neb.) where livers were scored and hot car - cass weights recorded.

These results indicate the low protein distillers by-product has feed - ing performance similar to DDGS at the same inclusion level across all variables measured. Feeding DBRAN in this trial, up to 45% of the diet, resulted in improved performance compared to feeding high-moisture/dry-rolled corn, suggesting it has 100-108 % the energy value of corn depending on its inclusion level in the diet. The energy value of DDGS in this trial was 103 % the energy value of corn at 30 % dietary DM inclu - sion. This number concurs with past researc h (2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 45-48) showing similar perfor - mance of DDGS to a high-moisture corn/wet corn gluten feed control ratio n at 20 and 40 % DM inclu - sions of DDGS. In this study, WDGS was not fed. No comparison can be made between Dakota Bran Cake and WDGS. 1Virgil R. Bremer, graduate student; Gale n E. Erickson, assistant professor; T erry J.

Crawford, Matt K. Luebbe, T erry J. Klopfenstein, Galen E. Erickson, Clinton R. Krehbiel Greg A. Nunnery1 Summary Six ruminally and duodenally can - nulated steers were used in a metabo - lism experiment to determine effects of addin g a ruminal buffer to diets containing increasing levels of roughage. Steers were fed high-concentrate diets containing 4.5, 9.0, or 13.5% alfalfa hay with or without 1.0% MIN-AD ruminal buffer. There were no differ - ences observ e d in feed intake, ruminal metabolism, or total tract digestibility due to MIN-AD inclusion in the diet. Averag e pH increased and time below pH 5.6 and pH 5.3 decreased with increasing alfalfa level. Total tract digestibilit y decrease d with increasing alfalfa level. Addition of MIN-AD to high-concentrat e diets did not produce a response similar to increasing the rough - age level in the diet. Introduction Modern beef cattle finishing diets routinely contain in excess of 85% concentrate. Feeding high levels of concentrate which contains rapidly fermentable starch increases ener - getic efficiency of a feedlot ration, but also predisposes cattle to metabolic disorders such as ruminal acidosis. Decreased DMI and ADG may result from mild acidosis, while more severe acidosis may cause prolonged reduc - tions in DMI and ADG and possibly even death. Roughages are included in high- grain finishing diets to reduce diges tive and metabolic disorders. However, on an energy basis, rough - ages are one of the most expensive ingredients in the ration, and are therefore included in finishing diets at low levels. Ruminal buffers are added to beef feedlot diets in an attempt to prevent ruminal pH depression and fluctuation and ultimately acidosis. By providing for a more constant rumi - nal pH, buffers decrease fluctuations in DMI, and also allow for replace - ment of a portion of the dietary forage with a higher-energy feedstuff. The avoidance of intake-depressing diges - tive disorders should ultimately result in fewer days on feed. The objective of this experiment was to determine effects of MIN-AD ruminal buffer and forage level on feed intake, ruminal metabolism, and extent of digestion in steers fed a high-concentrate diet. Procedure Six ruminally and duodenally can - nulated Holstein steer calves (initial BW = 500 lb) were assigned randomly to one of six treatments in a 3 x 2 factorial, arranged in a 6 x 6 Latin square. Following a 21-day adaptation to a high-concentrate diet, steers were assigned to a treatment and received a different treatment in each period and received every treatment once over the course of the experiment for a total of six replications per treatment. Steers received either 4.5, 9.0, or 13.5% roughage with or without MIN-AD ruminal buffer (calcium magnesium carbonate; MIN-AD, Inc., Amarillo, Tex.) which was provided at 1.0% of the diet DM (Table 1). The concen - trate portion of each treatment con - tained an 80:20 ratio of high-moisture corn and dry-rolled corn, and the roughage was provided as alfalfa hay. MIN-AD was provided as part of a dry supplement. All diets contained 0.25% Mg, 30.8 mg/kg Rumensin, and 11 mg/kg Tylosin. Steers did not receiv e an implant in this experiment. Periods were 21 days in length (12- day diet adaptation and 9-day data collection) and all animals were fed for ad-libitum intake. Bunks were read once daily throughout each perio d at 0730 and feed offerings were adjusted accordingly for feed - ing at 0800. All feed refusals were removed, quantified, and sampled. Steers were individually fed in free stalls from days 1-12 and days 18-21 of each perio d . In the afternoon of day 12, steers were moved and tethered to individual metabolism stalls and were allowed to acclimate to these stalls overnight. Beginning on day 13, steers were fed in individual feed bunks suspended from load cells con - nected to a computer equipped with software allowing for continuous data acquisition. Feed weight in each bunk was recorded once every minute and continuously stored for each steer throughout the day. Feed intake mea - surements (days 13-18 of each perio d ) T able 1.

Also on day 13 of each period, sub - mersible pH electrodes were placed into the rumen of each steer through the ruminal cannula and remained in place through the morning of day 18. Each pH electrode was encased in a weighted, four-wire metal shroud to keep the electrode in a stationary sus - pended position approximately 4 to 6 inches above the ventral floor of the rumen. Electrodes were linked direct - ly to a computer equipped with data acquisition software to record rumi - nal pH every six seconds and average ruminal pH every minute throughout the pH data collection phase. On day 18 of each period the ruminal pH electrodes were removed and steers were returned to their respective free stalls. Ruminal pH measurements included average, maximum, and minimum pH, time spent below pH 5.3 and 5.6, area of pH below 5.3 and 5.6 (time below x magnitude below), pH variance, and magnitude of pH change. Ruminal samples were col - lected from each steer immediately before feeding on day 21, and 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 hours after feeding for VFA analyses.Chromic oxide was used as an indigestible marker for estimating fecal output. Boluses containing 7.5 g chromic oxide were inserted through the ruminal cannula twice daily (0700 and 1900 h) from days 8-16. Fecal grab samples were collected 0, 6, and 12 hours post-feeding on days 14-17. Data were analyzed as a 3 x 2 facto - rial treatment arrangement and Latin square experimental design using the Mixed procedure of SAS. Model effects were period, forage level, MIN- AD level, forage x MIN-AD interac - tion, and steer. Steer was considered a random effect. Least squares means were separated using the PDIFF state - ment in SAS when protected by a sig - nificant ( P < 0.10) F-test. Forage level was analyzed for linear and quadratic response s . Results Intake Behavior Intake data presenting the simple effects of MIN-AD inclusion, alfalf a level, and their interaction are pre - sented in Table 2. An interaction between alfalfa level and MIN-AD inclusion was observed for DMI/meal as steers consuming the 13.5% alfalf a , 1.0% MIN-AD treatment had greater (P < 0.05) DMI/meal than those con - suming either the 4.5% alfalfa, no MIN-AD treatment or the 9.0% alfal - fa, 1.0% MIN-AD treatment. A simi - lar interaction ( P < 0.05) was observed with time spent eating per meal, as the steers consuming the 13.5% alfalf a , 1.0% MIN-AD treatmen t and the 9.0% alfalfa, no MIN-A D treat - ment spent more time eating per meal than steers consuming the 4.5% alfalfa, no MIN-AD treatment. This suggests the 4.5% alfalfa, no MIN-AD treatment produced some digestive disturbances that altered the normal intake behavio r of these steers. There were no alfalfa level x MIN-AD inclu - sion responses ( P > 0.10) for any other intak e variable. Neither the main effect of alfalfa level nor the main effect of MIN-AD inclusion were significant ( P > 0.10) for any of the measured intake variables. Dry matter intake ranged from 14.0 to 15.4 lb/ day. Intake s were numerically higher with 1.0% MIN-AD and 4.5% alfalfa compared with no MIN-AD and 4.5% alfalfa; however, the opposite response was observed at the 9.0% alfalfa level with a 1.4 lb numerical decrease in intake when 1.0% MIN-AD was include d in the diet.T able 2.

All rights reserved. 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 61 Ruminal pH and VFA Production There were no effects on ruminal pH due to either MIN-AD inclusion or MIN-AD x alfalfa level interaction; therefore all ruminal pH data are presented showing the main effects of alfalfa level and MIN-AD inclusion (Table 3). Ruminal pH averaged 5.53 and 5.48 with 0 and 1.0% MIN-AD, respectively, and ranged from 4.97 to 6.36 for the no MIN-AD treatments and from 4.96 to 6.33 for the 1.0% MIN-AD treatments. Average rumi - nal pH responded linearly ( P < 0.05) to increasing alfalfa level, with the lowest ruminal pH observed at the 4.5% alfalf a level and the highest at the 13.5% alfalfa level. Maximum and minimum ruminal pH exhibited a response similar to that observed with average pH. The difference betwee n the maximum and minimum pH (pH change) was fairly constant across alfalf a level, as was pH variance. A lin - ear response ( P < 0.05) due to alfalf a level was observed for time below pH 5.6 and time below pH 5.3. For both variables, the impact was great - est when steers consumed the 4.5% alfalfa treatments. Subacute acidosis is generally defined as a rumina l pH below 5.6. In this study, when steers consumed the 4.5% alfalf a treat - ments, they had a ruminal pH below 5.6 for 1,015 minutes per day, and ruminal pH below 5.3 for 614 min - utes per day. This represents nearly 17 hours of the day that these steers experie n ced subacute acidosis, and over 10 hours per day were spent at a pH of less than 5.3. Time spent below pH 5.6 was reduced 16 and 23% when steers consumed diets co n taining 9.0 or 13.5% alfalfa, respectively. Area below pH 5.6 responded ( P = 0.05) similarly to time below pH 5.6, while area below pH 5.3 exhibited a similar decline with increasing alfalfa level; however, the response was not signifi - cant ( P > 0.10). The area measure - ments represent the magnitude of pH depression multiplied by the time spent below the selected pH level. There was little impact on VFA production due to alfalfa level, MIN- AD inclusion, or their interaction (Tabl e 4). Total VFA measured 101.5 mM when averaged across all treat - ments. MIN-AD inclusion did not impact ( P > 0.10) any measured VFA variable. Acetate production averaged 49.0 and 50.5 mM for the 0 and 1.0% MIN-AD treatments, respectively, while propionate production averaged 33.3 mM with no MIN-AD inclusion and 36.7 mM with 1.0% MIN-AD inclusio n . A quadratic response (P < 0.05) due to alfalfa level was observed for propionate production, with the highest propionate levels observed when steers consumed the 9.0% alfalfa treatments. This quadrat - ic response ( P < 0.05) was also present with the acetate:propionate ratio, with the lowest ratio observed with the 9.0% alfalfa level. Total Tract Digestibility Total tract digestibility of DM and OM was calculated from estimated fecal output as measured by dosing of chromic oxide. There were no differ - ences ( P > 0.10) observed for either DM or OM total tract digestibility due to MIN-AD inclusion or MIN-AD in - clusion x alfalfa level interaction (Ta -ble 4), with DM digestibility averagin g 82.7 and 83.4% and OM digestibi l ity averaging 84.8 and 85.4% for the 0 and 1.0% MIN-AD treatments, re - spectively. Total tract DM digestibility decrease d linearly ( P < 0.05) from 84.6 to 80.6% with increasing alfalfa level. Organic matter digestibility exhibite d the same response (P < 0.05), with total tract digestibil - ities of 86.5, 85.8, and 83.0% when alfalfa was included in the diet at 4.5, 9.0, and 13.5%, respectively. The increase in alfalfa level in this expe r iment was in place of corn, which would explain the digestibility respons e . In summary, ruminal metabolism and eating behavior were not impact - ed by the addition of MIN-AD rumi - nal buffer to steer diets. An increase in alfalfa level increased ruminal pH and decreased time spent at subacute pH levels, but also decreased OM di - gestibility. Additional analyses are yet to be completed to further evaluate the impact of MIN-AD in this study. Rumina l buffers are occasionally added to feedlot rations to mediate digestive disturbances without having to add roughage to the diet. In this study, however, the addition of MIN- AD to high concentrate diets did not produce responses similar to those produced by increasing the roughage level in the diet. 1Grant Crawford, graduate Animal Science, Lincoln; Clint Krehbiel, associat e professor, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater; and Greg Nunnery, MIN-AD Inc., Amarillo, T ex.T able 4.

Mader1 Summary Two trials were conducted to evaluate feeding sodium chloride salt (NaCl) and soybeans to feedlot cattle in summer and winter seasons. The treatments were 1) control; 2) 1% added salt; 3) 5% added whole soybeans; and 4) the combination of 1% added salt and 5% added whole soybeans. Added salt had a tendency to decrease dry matter intake and increase water intake. Additional salt and soy - beans elevated tympanic temperatures. Treatment did not have an effect on performance, carcass quality grade, or dressing percentage. Introduction In recent years, the low price that producers received for soybeans allowe d soybeans to become a com - petitively priced source of fat in cattle rations. Supplemental fat may have beneficial effects under both hot and cold environmental conditions. Fat is an energy dense energy source, which could enhance available digestible energy and feed efficiency of cattle ex - posed to cold stress. However, fat has a lower heat increment than proteins and carbohydrates, which could be beneficial during hot weather, and a disadvantage in cold weather. During hot weather, increased dietary mineral concentration due to declining feed intake and the poten - tial depletion of key cations from heat stress may be required. Potassium and sodium (Na) are the primary cations involved in the maintenance of acid-base chemistry. Salt (NaCl) is a common feed ingredient, which can be used to regulate feed intake, particularly at levels of 5% or more of the total diet dry matter. However, at levels less than 1% of the diet dry matter, cattle do have an appetite for salt, which tends to stimulate intake. Levels of salt that stimulate or restrict feed intake may vary depending on feeding conditions and type of envi - ronmental stress to which cattle are exposed. Effects of switching from low-salt, low-fat diets to diets contain - ing elevated levels of salt and/or fat is unknown. The objectives of this study were to assess effects of switch - ing cattle from a normal feedlot diet to higher salt and/or added fat from soybeans diets during summer and winter feeding periods. Procedure Summer Trial Ninety-six crossbred heifers and forty-eight crossbred steers were used for this trial. Prior to trial initia - tion, cattle were vacc i nated (Bar-Vac 7/Somnus and Express 4; Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica Inc., St. Joseph, Mo.) and weighed. Weight and sex were used to allot animals to 18 pens. At trial initiation, heifers and steers were implanted with Revalor-H or Revalo r -S (Intervet Inc., Millsboro, Del.), respectively, weighed (mean BW = 878 lb) and sorted into allotte d pens. A 3 x 3 Latin square design was utilized in which diet treatments were compared during three nine- day treatment periods. Between each treatment period, the control diet was fed to all cattle during a five-day adjustment period. Diet treatments (Table 1) were: 1) control; 2) 1% add - ed sodium chloride (salt); and 3) 1% added sodiu m chloride (salt) and 5% added whole soybeans. All cattle were on control diet prior to trial initiation and started on treatment diet on day 1. Following completion of the third period, cattle remained on the last pe - riod treatment diet for 39 days, until slaughter. Dry matter (DMI) and water (DWI) intakes were recorded daily. Body weights were obtained following completion of the latin square (day 43) and the day before slaughter (day 92). Hot carcass weight, yield grade, and marbling score were obtained at slaughte r . Tympanic temperatures (TT) were recorded using Stowaway XTI7 data loggers and thermistor s (Onse t Corporation, Pocasset, Mass.). The thermistor was inserted ap - proximately four to five inches into the ear canal until the tip was near the tympanic membrane. The loggers recorded temperatures at 1-hour in - tervals in 20 animals from eight pens (five animal s tota l /treatment) during the last 6 days of the second period. Treatments for the second period were imposed in late July. T able 1. Composition of diets fed in summer trial (DM basis).

Tympanic temperatures were analyzed usin g a repeated measures model that includ - ed diet treatment, time of day, day, and the interaction of diet treatment by time of day. The specified term for the repeated statement was animal. Winter Trial One-hundred sixty-eight crossbred steers were used for this trial. Prior to trial initiation, cattle were vaccinated (Vision 7/Somnus and Titanium 5 PHM Bac 1; Intervet dewormed (Safe-Guard; Inter Inc., Millsboro, Del.), treated for external parasites (Saber; Scher - ing Plough Animal Health, Union, N.J.), and weighed. This weight was used to allot animals to 24 pens. At trial initiation, cattle were implanted (Revalor-S; Intervet Inc., Millsboro, Del.), weighed (mean BW = 895 lb), and sorted to their allotted pens. A 3 x 4 incomplete latin square design was utilized with 10-day treatment periods in which diet treatments were compared. Between each treatment period, an 11-day adjustment period was used in which the control diet was fed to all cattle. Diet treatments (Table 2) were: 1) control diet; 2) 1% added sodium chloride (salt); 3) 5% added soybean diet; and 4) 1% added sodium chloride (salt) and 5% added soybeans. The control diet was fed to all cattle nine d prior to imposing the first treatment period. Follow - ing completion of the third period of the latin square, cattle remained on respective diets for an additional 38 days, and were then slaughtered. When including the 10 days from the final period of the latin square, the cattle were on the final diet for 48 days. Dry matter intake and DWI were recorded daily. Body weights were obtaine d the day before slaughter. Animals were observed at 0800 dur - ing the last four days of each period and the number of animals in each pen showing signs of shivering was recorded. Tympanic temperatures were recorded at 1-hour intervals in three animals from each of two pens (six animals total/treatment) of each treatment for the last eight days of the Periods 1 and 2. Treatment periods were imposed in early January, late January, and mid-February. The TT data were obtained from the same animals in each period. All data were analyzed using the Proc Mixed procedures of SAS. Dry matter and water intakes were ana - lyzed using repeated measures for an incomplete 3 x 4 Latin square design. The model included the effects of soybeans, salt, period day, period, and all possible interactions. The specified term for the repeated statement was pen within period. Tympanic temper - atures were analyzed using a repeated measures model that included soy - beans, salt, and time of day with all possible interactions. The specified term for the repeated statement was animal within period. Results Mean ambient temperatures (Table 3), during the period TT were ob - tained were above 10-year normal in both the summer (78.9 vs 72.1oF) and winter (26.8 vs 23.2oF). Based on THI values (mean = 74.4 summer and 31.3 winter), conditions were sufficient to produce moderate stress in both sea - sons. Generally, a THI outside of the range of 35-74 is considered sufficient to elicit stress responses in beef cattle.

Even though dietary treatment effects were not observed in intakes during the summer, the addition of salt pro - duced similar trends in DMI, DWI, and DMI per DWI ratio in both sea - sons. The lack of significance in the summer trial may be partially due to differences in DMI between the two trials. Winter DMI was 3.5 lb greater than summer intakes. This difference would indicate that the winter cattle consumed nearly 0.6 oz more salt per day than the summer cattle.T able 4.

On day 1 of the period, DWI was greater for all cattle fed salt and soybean diets when compared to cattle fed the con - trol diet. However, DWI declined for salt-fed cattle on days 2 and 3, but sta - bilized and became similar to control cattle by day 5 and remained similar for the duration of the period. No significant differences were found for any treatment in perfor - mance data for the summer trial (Table 6). However, in the winter, the addition of salt tended to lower (P < 0.10) USDA yield grade (Table 7). These data suggest that switching to diets containing the combination of added salt and soybeans may ele - vate body temperature in the summer and winter seasons, even though dry matter intake is depressed. However, added salt, by itself, tends to lower DMI and body temperature, while increasing DWI. Added soybeans by itself did not have an effect on DMI, DWI, or body temperature. Added salt or soybeans had no effect on carcass quality grade or dressing percentage. 1Sheryl Colgan, research technologist; T erry Mader, professor, Animal Science, Northeast Researc h and Extension Center, Concord.The winter trial showed a diet treatment by period day interaction (P < 0.10) for DMI (Figure 1).

Baltensperger1 Summary Cattle were fed coarse rolled or whole field peas in a finishing diet to determine impact on finishing performance. The peas were included in the diet DM at 0%, 15%, and 30%. There were no signif- cant differences in ADG, F:G, or carcass characteristics among processing methods or field pea level. DMI was significantly different due to level and not processing of peas. The DMI increased as the field peas inclusion increased to 30% the diet DM Field peas can be fed whole and replace corn in the diet up to 30%. Introduction Field pea production has increased in the United States as well as west - ern Nebraska. The majority of the field peas are grown under contract for human consumption. Field peas must meet a strict quality guidelines to enter the human market. The peas that are not eligible for human con - sumption are then available for live - stock feed. Field peas can be used as a protein source since they contain 20- 28% CP. However, large quantities are available and producers prefer to feed large quantities or higher inclusion rates to utilize the peas as an energ y source as well as protein. Ofte n , field peas are grown by producers that own some livestock, but do not have grain processing equipment and the question arises as to the benefits of processing the peas before feeding. The objectives of this trial were to compare coarse rolled to whole peas in a finishing diet; and inclusion of 15% or 30% in dry-rolled corn finish - ing diets. Procedure Two hundred and five crossbred yearlings steers (average weight = 1068 lb) were randomly assigned to 20 pens and then pens were assigned random - ly to five treatments. Initially cattle were weighed and implanted with Synovex Plus. Cattle were in pens with 10-11 head per pen, and four pens per treatment. Cattle were fed whole or coarse-rolled peas at 15 and 30% of the diet DM or a dry rolled corn diet (Table 1). The peas were rolled through a roller mill with the objec - tive of breaking the seed coat of the peas and breaking into two or more pieces. Combinations of two supple - ments were fed due to the protein content of the peas. Each supplement contained equal amounts of vitamins, trace minerals, and monensin, but the CP was 10% and 58%. Therefore, peas replaced corn and protein. The cattle were transitioned between the growing ration and a finishing ration in 21 days; using three steps with 10% concentrate replacing forage in each step to the final diet (fed for 7 days each). The cattle were fed an inclu - sion of field peas at 0%, 15%, and 30%; the peas were either fed whole or course rolled. It was assumed the corn silage was 45% grain and 55% roughage giving 10% roughage DM in the final finishing diets. Cattle were fed a total 75 days to harvest and car - cass data collected 18 hr after harvest. The data were analyzed in SAS using Proc Mixed with means separated with contrast statements testing level, processing and their interaction. Treatment means with < 0.05 were considered significant. Results Cattle performance data are shown in Table 2. There were significant dif - ferences in DMI due to level, but not processing. The processing did not show an effect on intake, but as the field pea inclusion increased to 30% the DMI increased. However, there were no significant differences for ADG, or F:G between coarse rolled and whole peas or between levels. No significant differences in carcass data were detected. Numerically there ap - pears to be several benefits in process - ing when 30% peas were fed; however, in this trial the differences were not great enough to be statistically differ - ent.

Erickson1 Summary A clinical trial was conducted dur - ing the summer of 2004 to evaluate the effects of vaccinating cattle against Escherichia coli on the probability of detecting E. coli O157:H7 in feces and colonization at the terminal rectum. The probability for vaccinated or nonvac - cinated cattle to shed E. coli O157:H7 in feces was not significantly different. However, the probability for steers to be colonized by E. coli O157:H7 in the terminal rectum was greatly reduced for vaccinated (0.3%) compared with non - vaccinated (20.0%) steers. We concluded that the vaccine was effective at reducing colonization of E. coli O157:H7 at the terminal rectum of cattle. Introduction Beef cattle represent an important reservoir for E. coli O157:H7 and, in cattle, the mucosal cells 3-5 cm proxi - mal to the terminal rectum are an important site of colonization. Previ - ous research at Nebraska found that vaccinating feedlot cattle against Type III secretory proteins of Escherichia coli reduced the probability that cattle shed E. coli O157:H7 in the their feces (2005 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 61-63); however, no research docu - menting the effects of the vaccine on colonization of E. coli O157:H7 in the terminal rectum has been reported. Intervention strategies aimed at re - ducing colonization in the terminal rectum could aid beef industry efforts to reduce E. coli O157:H7 contamina - tion of beef products. Therefore, a clinical trial was conducted to evalu - ate the effects of vaccination on the probability that cattle shed E. coli O157:H7 in the feces, and that of ani -mals colonized by this organism in the terminal rectum when the treatment is applied at the pen level. Procedure The clinical trial was conducted during the summer months (May - September) of 2004 at the University of Nebraska Beef Research Feedlot at Ithaca, Neb. Two hundred eighty eight medium - weight steers were stratified by weight and assigned randomly to 36 pens (eight head/pen) and pens were assigned randomly to vaccination treatment. Cattle were stratified by weight so the heaviest 36 cattle could be systematically assigned to 1 of 36 pens using a random number genera - tor. This process was repeated seven more times so that each pen would have a total of eight animals per pen. Treatments included vaccinated and nonvaccinated pens of steers. Steers in vaccinated pens received three doses of the vaccine at 21-day intervals. Steers in nonvaccinated pens received 3 doses of the adjuvant (placebo) at the same 21-day intervals. Researchers and feedlot personnel were blinded to the actual vaccination treatments. Each steer was sampled by rectal fecal grab on day 0 and every 14 days of the feeding period following admin - istration of the treatment, resulting in 1 pre-treatment period (day 0), and 4 test-period samplings (14, 28, 42, and 56 days post treatment). Feces from all steers were collected for culture on the same day within the same test period. All fecal samples were taken immedi - ately to the UNL E. coli lab and ana - lyzed for presence of E. coli O157:H7 using procedures previously described (2004 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 67-68) with modifications. A terminal rectum mucosal (TRM) sample was collected from each steer by scraping mucosal cells 3-5 cm prox - imal to the rectoanal juncture at har - vest. The TRM samples were cultured using standard methods invol v ing se - lective enrichment, immun o magnetic separation, agar plating, biochemical and immunological testing, and PCR confirmation as previously described (2004 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 67-68) with modifications. The effect of vaccine treatment on the probability to detect E. coli O157: H7 from feces was tested by model - ing the probability of detecting E. coli O157:H7 from feces using the logit link function in a multivariable gener - alized estimation equation (GEE) model (Proc GENMOD, SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). Least squared means of the parameter estimates from the mul - tivariable logistic models were used to estimate adjusted probabilities for class variables (vaccine treatment). Relative risk (RR) values for levels of vaccine treatment were calculated from the adjusted probabilities and vaccine efficacy was calculated as (1-RR). Results E. coli In total, E. coli O157:H7 was recov - ered from 86 of 1,419 culture observa - tions (6.1%) from feces collected from steers in vaccinated and nonvacci - nated pens. During the pre-treatment sampling period, the average propor - tion of steers shedding E. coli O157: H7 within the treated pens was 6.3% and was 1.4% in nonvaccinated pens (P = 0.07). In this study an association betwee n test period and the prob a- bility for cattle to shed E. coli O157:H7 approached statistical significance (P = 0.07; Figure 1). Other studies suggest test period was significantly associated with fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 (Potter et al., Vaccine 2004; 2005 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 61-63, Khaitsa et al, 2003), The odds of detecting E. coli O157:H7 in the feces increased as the time between the last vaccination and sampling occurre d .

The probability to detect E. coli O157:H7 in feces during the sum - mers of 2002 and 2003 was 0.15 and 0.20, respectively ( 2004 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 67-68; 2005 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 61-63). The probability to detect E. coli O157:H7 in feces over the course of this study was 0.06. After adjusting for sample and dietary treat - ment, the odds for vaccinated cattle to test positive for E. coli O157:H7 in the feces were 0.83 times the odds for nonvaccinated cattle to test positive for E. coli O157:H7 in the feces. Terminal Rectum Mucosa The factors explaining the prob - ability for steers to test positive for E. coli O157:H7 in TRM samples in the multivariable logistic regression model were diet and vaccination treatment. Dietary treatment did not interact with vaccination. Vaccination was significantly ( P < 0.001) associ - ated with the probability for cattle to be colonized by E. coli O157:H7 1-2 inches proximal to the rectoanal juncture (Figure 3). After adjusting for dietary treatment, the odds of vac - cinated steers to be colonized by E. coli O157:H7 1-2 inches proximal to the rectoanal juncture was 0.01 times the odds of nonvaccinated steers to be colonized by E. coli O157:H7 at the same location, a vaccine efficacy of 98.5%. Although we were unable to detect a significant difference in the proba - bility to detect E. coli O157:H7 in feces due to vaccination treatment, results from this study suggest vaccination effectively reduced the probability for cattle to become colonized by E. coli O157:H7 3-5 cm proximal to the recto - anal juncture. 1Robert Peterson, research technician; Dave Smith, Rod Moxley, professors, Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences; T erry Klopfenstein, Galen Erickson, professors, Animal Science; Susan Hinkley, assistant professor, Veterinary and Bio - medical Sciences.

Erickson 1 Summary A clinical trial was conducted within 1 9 Nebraska feedlots to evaluate effects of an E. coli vaccine on the probability to detect E. coli O157:H7 on ROPES or for cattle to be colonized by E. coli O157:H7 at the terminal rectum. Vaccinated pens of cattle were less likely to test ROPE-positive than nonvaccinated pens of cattle and a lower probability for E. coli O157:H7 coloniz- ation among vaccinated cattle compared with nonvaccinated cattle was observed. The vaccine was effective at reducing E. coli O157:H7 in the feedlot pen environment and colonization at the terminal rectum of cattle. Introduction Research reported in the previous article of this report indicates several benefits of vaccination for E. coli O157: H7 in market ready beef cattle ( 2006 Nebraska Beef Report ). However, vac - cination has not been evaluated in a large-scale study that accounted for multiple factors known to influence the probability to detect E. coli O157:H7 in the feedlot environment. For example, time of year, pen condition, and feedlot have all been identified as factors that explain the variability in the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 ass o ciated with feed - lot cattle. Therefore, there was a need to evaluate vaccination as a pre-harvest intervention strategy in a large-scale commercial feedlot study. Procedure The study was a large-scale clini - cal trial designed to test the effect of a two-dose vaccination regimen on the probability to detect E. coli O157:H7 on pen-test devices (ROPES) and from mucosal cells of the rectoanal junction of cattle at harvest. Commercial feed -lots were classified as either feeding or not feeding a direct-fed microbial (DFM) product. Pens of vaccinated and nonvaccinated cattle within feed - lots were matched by time of sampling, reprocessing schedule, and estimated days to finish weight. Vaccine was given to all cattle within treated pens at initial processing and again at reimplan t . Pair-matched nonvaccinat - ed pens of cattle were sampled on the same days. Research personnel respon - sible for vaccinating cattle and collect - ing samples and other data from the cattle were blinded to microbiological results. Research personnel working in the microbiological laboratory were blinded to treatment assignments. Each pen of cattle enrolled in the study was sampled for E. coli O157: H7 starting at least one week after the second dose of vaccine was given (untreate d pens of cattle were sampled on the same day as the pair-matched vaccinated pen) and continued ever y three weeks for four test period sam - plings. Pens were tested for E. coli O157:H7 by hanging seven ropes from the neckrail of the feedbunks where cattle could easily lick, chew, or rub on them. Pens were classified ROPES- positive if E. coli O157:H7 was recov - ered from at least one rope-device. E. coli O157 was isolated and identified by standard methods involving selec - tive enrichment, immunomagnetic separation, agar plating, biochemical and immunological testing and PCR confirmation. The outcome variable (Yes/No) defined if pens tested ROPES-positiv e for E. coli O157:H7. The binomial probability of detecting E. coli O157: H7 from at least one ROPES within a pen was modeled with a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model using the GENMOD procedure of SAS accounting for a correlated data structure with repeated measure of pens (test periods), and clustering of matched pairs of pens within feedlot. The variable of interest was vac - cination (Yes/No). Additional specific contrasts were vaccination versus not vaccinated and short revaccina - tion period (13-45 days) versus long revaccination period (45-100 days). Potential confounders tested in the GEE model were feeding a DFM, regio n of the state (defined as East or West of a North/South line extending through Grand Island, Neb.), month of sampling, the condition of the pen floor (dry and dusty, wet and muddy, ideal condition), number of cattle in the pen (145 cattle or less, greater than 145), cleanliness of the cattle, and test period. An interaction between vac - cination and test period was tested. Additionally, the variable represent - ing direct-fed microbial feeding was forced in the model as a fixed effect because of its importance as a poten - tial confounder. Other variables remained in the model if they contrib - uted to the model fit and significantly explained the probability for ROPES- positive pens ( a 0.05). Twenty one pens of cattle on the study (11 vaccinated, 10 not vacci - nated) were followed to the packing plant so samples could be collected to test effect of the vaccine on probabil - ity for colonization of mucosal cells of the terminal rectum. Cattle were sys - tematically selected for sampling from within each pen. The sample size for each pen was calculated so that we would be 95% confident to estimate EC prevalence at 50% with a 15% pre - cision. Terminal rectum mucosal cells (TRM) were collected by scraping the mucosa of the terminal rectum 1-2 inches proximal to the rectoanal junc - ture. The TRM were cultured using standard methods involving selective enrichment, immunomagnetic sepa - ration, agar plating, biochemical and immunological testing, and PCR con - firmation as previously described. The outcome of interest was the probability of detecting E. coli O157:H7 from TRM, analyzed using a general - ized linear mixed model. Differences in the mean days from reprocessing to slaughter for vaccinated and not vacci - nated pens was tested by the Student =s t test assuming equal variances. \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

There was no significant interaction between vaccination treat - ment and test period ( P = 0.94), demon - strating efficacy of the vaccine did not change over time after revaccination. The variables representing month of the year, region of the state, and the number of cattle within the pen remained in the model because they significantly explained the probabil - ity for pens of cattle to test ROPES- positiv e . Condition of the pen floor was retained in the model because the variable approached significance and has previously been demonstrated to explain the probability for pens of cattle to test ROPES-positive. Terminal Rectum Mucosa Terminal rectum mucosal (TRM) samples were collected from 720 cat - tle; 382 vaccinated cattle from within 11 pens and 338 nonvaccinated cattle from 10 pens. Four-hundred forty-one cattle were from within 13 pens fed DFM and 279 cattle were from within 8 pens of cattle not fed DFM. Probability for E. coli O157:H7 col - onization of the mucosal cells of the terminal rectum at slaughter among vaccinated cattle was lower (4.7%) compared with nonvaccinated cattle (19.5%). Vaccination reduced the probability for cattle within a feedlot to be colonized with E. coli O157:H7 at slaughter (OR=0.20; P = 0.03). Vac - cine efficacy was 76% (Figure 2). Vaccination of cattle within commer - cial feedlots was effective for reducing the probability of detecting E. coli O157:H7 from ROPES and the vaccine reduced, at slaughter, E. coli O157:H7 colonization of the terminal rectum mucosal cells of cattle fed in a commercial system.

However, two matched pairs of cattle pens were not reprocessed until October and November leaving no usable observa - tions during the study period ending October 31 and cattle from two pairs of pens were not revaccinated; there - fore, the data analyzed were from 140 pens of cattle within 19 feedlots repre - senting 20,566 cattle. Data were not collected from all four periods for all pens of cattle ei - ther because some pens of cattle were marketed before all four test periods were completed, or because some test periods fell outside of the study period (after October 31). In total, 86 pair- matched pens of cattle were in feedlots feeding a direct-fed microbial (DFM) and 54 pair- matched pens of cattle were in feedlots not feeding a DFM.

Steers were started on Optaflexx treatment at one-week intervals and marketed as a single group. Feeding Optaflex x to feedlot steers increased ADG, improved F:G, and increased car - cass weight. Feeding 200 mg/head/day of Optaflexx improved feed conversion by 8.1% without impacting carcass characteristics. Feeding Optaflexx at 200 mg/head/d for 28 to 42 days appears beneficial when compared with feeding diets without Optaflexx. Introduction Optaflexx is a feed additive approve d for use in feedlot cattle during the final 28 to 42 days of the feeding period. Optaflexx can be fed at a rate of 70 to 430 mg/head/day and 9.1 to 27.3 g/ton (100% DM basis) in the final mixed diet to improve rate of weight gain and feed efficiency. While some information is avail - able on effects of Optaflexx dosage and feeding duration from research prior to F.D.A. approval of Optaflexx, post-approval data are limited. Becaus e of the wide range of approved inclusion rates, research to predict respons e at various doses and dura - tions is warranted. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate F: G and carcass characteristics when steers were fed 0, 100, or 200 mg/ head/day of Optaflexx for the final 28, 35, or 42 days prior to slaughter.Procedure Crossbred (English x Continen - tal) steer calves were received at the Agricultural Research and Develop - ment Center near Mead, Neb. in the fall of 2003. Calves were received on a common program and adapted to grain over a 21-day period by replac - ing alfalfa with high-moisture corn. Prior to initiation of Optaflexx treat - ment all cattle were fed 58.5% high- moistur e corn, 30% wet corn gluten feed (SweetBran, Cargill, Blair, Neb.), 7.5% alfalfa hay, and 4% dry supple - ment (DM basis). In late January, steers were re- implante d and weighed individu - ally on two consecutive days. At this time, steers were assigned to one of nine treatments, arranged as a 3 x 3 factorial with factors including Optaflex x feeding duration (final 28, 35, or 42 day of the finishing period) and Optaflexx dosage (0, 100, or 200 mg/head/day). Steers were separated into two blocks based on two-day re-implant weights. The heavy block consisted of 360 steers assigned ran - domly to 36 pens (10 steers/pen), while the light block consisted of 495 steers assigned randomly to 45 pens (11 steers/pen). Pens within a block were assigned randomly to one of nine treatments in the 3 x 3 factorial. An additional 69 steers were assigned randomly into six pens creating three baseline marketing groups. The baseline marketing cattle were fed the same diet as the heavy and the light block, and two pens (23 head) were slaughtered at initiation of each Optaflexx duration treatment (light block, 28, 35, 42 days) to determine carcass characteristics for later esti - mation of carcass changes during the Optaflexx feeding period. Carcass ADG and efficiency of weight transfer were calculated by regressing dress - ing percentage on days after initial weight using the baseline marketing cattle (day 0, 7, and 14; n=69) and all control cattle in the light block (day 42; n=164). This allowed for observa - tions of dressing percentage at 0, 7, 14, and 42 days after initial weights were measured. From this regres - sion, a theoretica l dressing percentage was determined by multiplying the duration of feeding after initiation of treatment with the slope generated from the regression and then sub - tracting this value from final dressing percentage. The slope represents gain in dressing percentage for each day after initiation of treatment. An ini - tial carcass weight was then calculated by multiplying the theoretical initial dressing percentage with live weight at the time of treatment initiation. Steers were implanted with Synovex-S initially and re-implanted with Revalor-S 100 and 104 days prior to marketing for the heavy and light block, respectively. The baseline marketing cattle received the same implan t treatments, and therefore were implanted 62, 69, and 76 days prior to slaughter for the 42, 35, and 28 day treatments, respectively. During the Optaflexx feeding perio d , a new Optaflexx dry supple - ment consisting of fine-ground corn was added to all diets to provide 0, 100, or 200 mg/head/day of Optaflexx. These diets included 55.4% high- moisture corn, 30.0% wet corn gluten feed, 7.5% alfalfa hay, 4% supplement, and 3.1% of the Optaflexx supplement (DM basis). Cattle were fed twice daily throughout the entire experi - ment at approximately 0800 and 1300 hours. Steers received 60% of their daily DM during the A.M. feeding and 40% during the P.M. feeding. To determine actual Optaflexx concen - tration in the delivered feed, samples were collected daily at the beginning, middle and end of each A.M. load and assayed. Feed assays showed Optaflexx was provided at target levels through - out the Optaflexx feeding period.\u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

Results Final live weight and carcass char - acteristics of the baseline marketing groups are presented in Table 1. In orde r to determine carcass weight gain and changes in carcass character - istics over the duration of Optaflexx feeding, it is assumed that the baseline marketing steers accurately represent the remaining steers in the experi - ment. Steer performance data are for the last 28, 35, or 42 days of the finishing period. All performance data pre - sented are based on live weight (4% shrink). Live weight at the initiation of Optaflexx treatment averaged 1,164 lb. Based on DMI, average Optaflexx intakes were 109 mg/day and 215 mg/day for the 100 and 200 mg treat - ments, respectively. Simple effects outlining feedlot per - formance for the Optaflexx feeding period are presented in Table 2. There were no dose x duration inte r actions (P > 0.58) for feedlot perfo r mance, and there were only two carcass char - acteristics (LM area and calculated (Continued on next page)T able 1.

In addition, one animal died from interstitial atypical pneumonia diagnose d during necropsy. All causes of removal from experiment appear unrelate d to Optaflexx treatments. Individual steer weights were taken on day 1 of Optaflexx treatment. Therefore, steers assigned to 42 days Optaflexx treatment were weighed 42 days prior to marketing, with the 35 days treatment steers weighed one week later, etc. Steers assigned to the heavy block were marketed one week prior to steers on the light block with cattle being fed for an average of 178 days. At the end of the experiment, all cattle within block were weighed live for determination of live performance during the Optaflexx feeding phase. All cattle were marketed at a com - mercial abattoir (Tyson Foods, Inc., Dakota City, Neb.) where carcass data were collected. Hot carcass weights and liver abscess scores were col - lected on the day of slaughter, while fat depth, kidney, pelvic, and heart fat (KPH), longissimus muscle area (LM area), marbling score, and overall maturity (lean and skeletal maturity) measurements were collected after a 36-hour chill. Yield grades were based on measured carcass characteristics. All data were analyzed as a ran - domized complete block design with block (i.e. two weight blocks) as a ran - dom effect. Treatments were analyzed as a 3 x 3 factorial design where the interaction between dose of Optaflexx and duration of feeding was tested initially.

Carcass ADG, estimated using the baseline market - ing groups as a reference, increased linearly ( P < 0.01) with Optaflexx dosage. In summary, feeding Optaflexx up to 200 mg/head/day for the last 28 to 42 days prior to marketing increases live weight gain, carcass weight, and improves feed conversion in feedlot steers. Larger longissimus area with - out an impact on fat depth suggests most, and possibly all, of the weight gain associated with Optaflexx feed - ing is due to lean carcass gain. 1Grant Crawford, graduate student; Galen Erickson, assistant professor; Kyle research Folmer, research techni - cian, Lincoln; and Mike Van Koevering, Elanco Animal Health, Omaha.USDA yield grade) exhi b iting a dose x duration interaction ( P < 0.01). Initial BW was similar across dosages and within feeding durations, however, cattle that bega n Optaflexx treatment 42 d prior to marketing were lighter and initial weights increased linearly as the shorter duration treatments were initiated. Beyond initial BW, duration of Optaflexx feeding had no effect ( P > 0.65) on feedlot per - formance, and little effec t on carcass characteristics ( P > 0.08). Therefore, the focus will be on the main effects of Optaflex x dosage (Table 3). Over - all, cattle gained more than 4.0 lb/day over the Optaflexx feeding period regardless of Optaflexx dosage. Feed - ing Optaflexx increased ADG linearly (P < 0.01) and decreased DMI linearly (P < 0.01). The actual decrease in DMI was slight (0.5 lb). The slight decrease in DMI and increase in ADG com - bined for a marked improvemen t in F: G (P < 0.01) due to feeding Optaflexx. Feed conversions were improved 2.9 and 8.1% when Optaflexx was fed at 100 and 200 mg/day, respectively. Carcass weight increased linearly (P < 0.01) with Optaflexx dosage. Marbling scores tended ( P = 0.10) to be reduced linearly with Opta - flexx feeding, and it appear s that the declin e occurred primarily at the 200 mg/head/day level (Table 3). Longissimu s area increased linearly (P < 0.01) from 13.2 to 13.7 square inches with Optaflexx dosage. An increase in muscling is a common observation with Optaflexx. Fat depth at the 12th rib averaged 0.55 inches, and was not impacted ( P > 0.30) by dosage. The increase in longissimus area without an increase in 12th rib fat suggests that the weight gain observed when feeding Optaflexx is primarily in muscle tissue. In this study, carcass weight increase d 6 and 8 lb for steers fed 100 and 200 mg of Optaflexx/head/day, respectively, compared with steers fed no Optaflexx. When comparing the final live weights of the treat - ment groups, the difference is 3 and 8 lb for the 100 and 200 mg/head/day treatments, respectively, compared with the steers fed no Optaflexx. This suggests the increase in ADG due to Optaflexx feeding was carcass gain, which is further supported by a slight numerical increase in dressing percentage and an increase in longis - simus area with increasing Optaflexx dosage. By using the baseline market - ing groups to estimate carcass gain during the Optaflexx feeding period, efficiency of weight transfer (carcass weight gain/live weight gain) was calculated at 74.6% across all treat - ments.

Erickson Bill D. Dicke T erry J. Klopfenstein Robert J. Cooper D.J. Jordon Jim S. Drouillard William M. Moseley Gary E. Sides1 Summary A commercial feedlot experiment was conducted using 1,807 heifers to evaluate the effects of Optaflexx fed in combination with MGA on finishing heifer performance. In heifers recieving MGA throughout the entire 126-143 day feeding period, feeding Optaflexx for the last 31-38 days increased ADG and hot carcass weight compared to heifers fed MGA but not Optaflexx. Heifers fed MGA and Optaflexx had increased DMI, improved feed efficiency and increase d final live weight. Carcass qual - ity measurements were not influenced by treatment. Introduction Optaflexx, the trade name for rac - topamine hydrochloride, is a beta-1 adrenergic agonist that increases weight gain the last 28 to 42 days of the finishing period. Melengestrol acetate (MGA) is an orally active progestogen that inhibits estrus and ovulation and is a product commonly fed to finishing heifers. MGA has also been shown to increase weight gain and improve feed efficiency in heifer s . Data on the response to feeding Optaflex x to finishing heif - ers are limite d . Previous heifer trials that were conducted did not include heifer s fed MGA in combination with Optaflexx; therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of feeding Optaflexx in combination with MGA on finishing heifer perfor - mance.Procedure The experiment was conducted between August 2004 and March 2005 using 1,807 heifers (714 lb 45.5) in a randomized block design. Follow - ing arrival, heifers were individually weighed, processed, and blocked by date received and site of procurement. During initial processing, heifer s were vaccinated for viral diseases (BoviShield Gold7 4, Pfizer, Animal Health, New York City, N.Y.), treated for internal and external parasites (Dectomax Injectable7, Pfizer, New York City, N.Y.), and implanted with Ralgro7 (Shering-Plough Animal Health, Union, N,J,). Heifers were determined to be bred, open, or freemartins by rectal palpation. Free - martins and heifers over 100 days pregnant were removed from the trial. Heifers less than 100 days pregnant were given Lutalyse7 (Pfizer, New York City, NY). Open heifers were not given Lutalyse, therefore, some nondiagnosed early pregnancies at initial processing may have allowed some pregnant heifers to complete the trial. Heifers from the separate loca - tions were assigned randomly to one of two treatments, and then assigned to one of 20 home pens (10 replica - tions/treatment). Treatments were: 1) heifers fed MGA (Pfizer Animal Health, New York City, N.Y.) for the entire finishing period, and 2) heif - ers fed MGA for the entire finishing perio d and Optaflexx7 (Elanco Ani - mal Health, Greenfield, Ind.) the last 31 to 38 days. MGA was not included in step up diets. The finishing diet was formulated to provide 0.4 mg of MGA/head, 330 mg of Rumensin 7 (Elanco)/head, and 90 mg of Tylan 7 (Elanco)/head/daily. During the last 31 to 38 days of finishing, Optaflexx was included in the diet to target 200 mg/hd/daily for cattle receiving Optaflex x treatment.Heifers were reimplanted with Synovex Plus 7 (Fort Dodge Animal Health) an average of 80 day pre- slaughter (range 73 to 87 days), with animals implanted on the same day within arrival block. The final diet contained 38% dry-rolled corn, 29.5% steam-flaked corn, 18% distillers grains, hay, 2% sorghum hay, 1.5% fat, and 5% supplement in the control diet (DM basis). The Optaflexx supplement was delivered in a pellet form, fed at 4% of the diet DM and replaced dry-rolled corn. Optaflexx supplement consisted of fine ground corn and wheat midds. The diet was formulated to contain 14.9% CP, 0.72% Ca, 0.37% P, and 6.9% fat (DM basis). Heifers were fed an average of 133 days (range 126 to 143 days). Pen weights were taken for each pen at initial processing, reimplant, start of Optaflexx feeding, and prior to shipment on the day of slaughter. Pen weights, excluding initial weight, were shrunk 4%. Initial weights were not shrunk because animals were processed immediately upon arrival or following an overnight receiving period. Pen weights were used for per - formance calculations on a live-basis. Additionally carcass weights were used and adjusted to a common dress - ing percentage of 63.5% to calculate a carcass adjusted live weight. Carcass adjusted live weight was used to deter - mine daily gain and feed conversion on a carcass adjusted basis. Both pens within a block (replica - tion) were harvested under similar conditions on the same day, at the same plant. Hot carcass weights and liver abscesses were recorded on the day of harvest. Carcass fat thickness, marbling score, kidney, pelvic and heart fat (KPH), longissimus muscle area and USDA yield grade were recorde d following a 24- to 36-hour chill.

Finishing diet cost of $120.16/ton was calculated using 10-year aver - age prices for ingredients ( agecon. unl.edu/mark/agprices/index.htm ). Intake and days on feed along with diet cost were used to determine total feed costs. In diets containing Opta - flexx, a cost of $0.26/day was added to ration cost to account for the cost of Optaflexx delivered in the bunk. Other costs included $0.35/head/day yardage, $30.00 processing, health, shipping, etc., and 7% interest on animal and feed. Initial animal cost was determined using a 10-year aver - age feeder heifer price /cwt ( ). Live sale price was calculated using a 10-year average fed heifer price of $ 70.24 /cwt. two-year average of $ 84.65 /cwt ( www.feuzmarketanalysis. com). Along with selling cattle on a live basis, a marketing grid profit - ability analysis was performed. Based on three different carcass grid-pricin g scenarios, profit or loss for each treat - ment on each grid was calculated. The analysis used three different grids consisting of a quality-rewarding grid, yield-rewarding grid, and a commod - ity grid, as proposed by Feuz (2002 Nebraska Beef Report, pp.39-41). The dressed price used for the 10-year average was and $134.03/ cwt ( www.feuzmarketanalysis.com ) for the two-year average. Premiums and discounts for each grid used are from Feuz (2002 Nebraska Beef Report, pp.39-41). Profitability was calculated from a 10-year and a two-year aver - age dress base price with individual grid premiums and discounts applied. Grid profit or loss was calculated from a carcass breakeven calculated as with live break-even, with hot carcass weight instead of final BW as a multi - plier. Animal performance, carcass data and economics were analyzed using the Mixed procedure of SAS, with treatment as a fixed effect, and block as a random effect. Data are presented with deads and railers removed from the analysis. Fifteen animals (eight Optaflexx and MGA and seven MGA alone) were removed from the study at the feedlot. Four and three heifers were removed from the Optaflexx and MGA and MGA alone treatment, respectively, after inclusion of Opta - flexx. Data were not collected from 72 rail-outs in the plant, 46 MGA only and 26 Optaflexx and MGA treated- heifers. Of the 1,720 heifers harvested, 852 were on the MGA alone and 868 were on the Optaflexx and MGA treatment, respectively. At slaughter, fetuses were observed in 82 heifers, 39 in the MGA alone group and 43 in the Optaflexx and MGA group. The preg - nant heifers are included in the analy - sis. Feed intake was figured according to feedyard close-out information on each individual pen of cattle. Results Performance Heifer live and carcass adjusted performance results are presented in Table 1. Final BW ( P = 0.53) was not different, but final BW was increased by 15.5 lb or 1.2% in Optaflexx fed heifers. However, at 1153 lb). Given this 5-lb advantage in initial weight, the gain increase was reduced to 11 lb (0.8%) for heifers fed Optaflexx and MGA compared MGA alone. DMI was increased by 0.38 lb/d (P < 0.01) for heifers fed Optaflexx and MGA compared to heifers fed MGA alone over the entire feeding period. Feed conversion was improved by 1.8% ( P = 0.03) for heifers fed MGA and Optaflexx compared with MGA alone, even though ADG was not impacted ( P = 0.41) when com - paring treatments over the entire 133 day finishing period. The diet containing Optaflexx was formulated to provide 200 mg/head/ day. However, based on DMI (range 22.3 to 25.9 lb) changes across block, actual intake averaged 205.0 mg/head/day (range 185.1 to 222.4 mg/hd/d). Animals consumed an average of .169 mg/lb Optaflexx (range .157 to .174 mg/lb) when calcu - lated on a per BW basis. When comparing treatments durin g the last 35 days (time heifers T able 1 .

Feeding Optaflexx in combination with increased ADG by 0.30 lb/day ( P = 0.09) which led to a slight improvement ( P = 0.07) in feed conversion of 6.7% for heifers fed Optaflexx and MGA compared to heifers receiving MGA alone when evaluating live performance. When using carcass adjusted performance (HCW/.635), final live weight was increased ( P = 0.01) 17.4 lb, or 1.4% for heifers receiving Opta - flexx compared to heifers fed MGA alone. When ADG was calculated from carcass weight, heifer ADG was increased ( P < 0.01) 0.14 lb/ head/day with a significant improve - ment in feed conversion of 1.6% for heifers over the entire feeding period. Despite the relatively small improve - ment when expressed over the entire feeding period, ADG and F/G of heif - ers fed Optaflexx and MGA compared to heifers fed MGA alone on a carcass- adjusted basis were significantly dif - ferent. When looking at only the last 35-day performance, heifers gained 0.32 lb/day more ( P = 0.01) than the heifers fed MGA only, and feed con - version was improved 7.9% ( P < 0.01) for heifers fed Optaflexx and MGA. Carcass Characteristics Carcasses of heifers in the Opta - flexx and no Optaflexx treatments (Table 2) did not differ in USDA yield grade, marbling score, percentage of USDA choice and select based on Chi- Square analysis, 12th rib fat thickness, ribeye area, KPH, empty body fat, cutability, and dressing percentage. However Optaflexx-fed heifers had 11 lb heavier (1.4%) hot carcass weight (P = 0.01). Optaflexx Economics Total cost using a 10-year aver - age (Table 3) was increased $10.44 for heifers fed Optaflexx and MGA (P = 0.01) due to cost of Optaflexx and increased DMI for heifers fed Optaflexx, although cost of gain was not different ( P = 0.19). Only live and commodity grid pricing are shown in Table 3 due to similar price outputs between grids. Live pricing ( P = 0.02) commodity ( P =0.04), yield reward - ing ( P =0.05), and quality rewarding (P =0.03) marketing grids showed an increase in total dollar value per ani - mal based on the increased gain in the heifers fed Optaflexx in combination with MGA. There was no difference in profit, although when using a 10-year average price for live heifers, heifers receiving Optaflexx and MGA were numerically $0.28 ( P = 0.93) more profitable when compared to heifers receiving MGA alone. Total cost ( P = 0.04) using a two- year average price (Table 3) was $9.92 higher for heifers fed Optaflexx and MGA, when compared to heifers fed MGA alone. Live pricing ( P = 0.02) commodity ( P =0.02), yield reward - ing ( P =0.03), and quality rewarding (P =0.02) marketing grids showed an increas e in total dollar value per animal based on the increase gain response in the heifers fed Optaflexx. However due to the incurred cost from feeding Optaflexx heifers market - ed on a live basis ( P = 0.49) were not different, but profit was numerically increased by $3.00/head.

Kreikemeier1 Summary To assess growth promoting agents efficacy among seasons, triiodothyro - nine, thyroxine, blood metabolites, and tympanic temperature were measured in summer and winter studies. Within each season, pens of heifers were assigned to one of six growth promotant treatments. Season by growth promotant treatment interactions (P < 0.05) indicated that the combination of estrogen and trenbo - lone acetate increased triiodothyronine in the winter, whereas trenbolone ace - tate alone decreased both triiodothy - ronine and thyroxine in the winter. Maximum tympanic temperature was greater (P < 0.01) in the summer than in the winter, while minimum tympani c temperature was lowered (P < 0.01) in the summer. Changes in blood metab - olite levels resulting from the use of growth promotants do not appear to substantially influence seasonal changes in body temperature. Introduction Within a season, changes in tem - perature, wind speed, precipitation, and/or radiation can significantly influence physiological and metabolic processes. Physiological character - istics, particularly when cattle are under environmental stress, could be further influenced by anabolic agents. The objective of this experiment was to assess feedlot heifer responses to cold and heat exposure when admin - istered growth promoting agents as determined by blood endocrine levels, plasma urea nitrogen (PUN), and tympanic temperature. Procedure During a summer and winter sea - son, crossbred Angus, nonpregnant, yearling heifers (108/season; mean initial BW = 842 lb) were used for obtainin g blood samples and tym - panic temperatures ( TT). Within a season, heifers had been stepped up to a 65.0 NEg (mcal/cwt; DM basis) high-energy finishing diet by the start of each study. Heifers were fed Rumensin and Tylan (Elanco Animal Health, Indianapolis, Ind.) through - out the experimental feeding period. Details of the vaccination, parasite control, and diet regimens used for the experiments have been reported previously (2003 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 42-45). In early December (winter season), and early June (summer sea - son), heifers were assigned randomly to 12 pens (nine heifers/pen) based on stratification of individual weights. Six growth promotant treatments (two pens of heifers/treatment/season) were imposed as follows: 1) control, 2) Compudose [24 mg Estradiol-17 mg of trenbolone acetate]; Intervet, Inc., Millsboro, Del.), 4) E + TBA (ET), 5) no implant and fed MGA (MGA; Pharmacia and Upjohn, Kalamazoo, Mich.), and 6) ET implant and fed MGA (ETM). Heifers were bled via jugular puncture and weighed on days 0, 28, 56, and 84. Cattle were fed 104 and 105 days for the winter and sum - mer feeding periods, respectively. Blood Collection and Assays In both seasons, heifers (four/pen) were bled via jugular puncture and weights were taken on days 0, 28, 56, and 84, beginning at 0800 and prior to being fed. Ten milliliters of blood for plasma were collected into tubes containing sodium heparin. Five milli - liters of blood also were collected for serum. After blood collection, tubes were centrifuged (3,400 rpm) for 10 minutes. Plasma and serum frac - tions were isolated and frozen until analyze d . Serum samples were ana - lyzed for insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) concentration using RIA nine ( T3) were quantified with solid phase RIA kits. Samples for T3 and T4 analysis were processed as separate assays. Temperature measures Individual heifers (two heifers/pen; four heifers/treatment/season) were used for obtaining TT, as a measure of body temperature, when ambient temperature was predicted to be < 32oF in the winter and > 77oF in the summer. Tympanic temperatures were recorded using data loggers and thermistor cables (Stowaway, XTI7, Onset Computer Corporation, Pocassatt, Mass.). Data loggers were secured in an ear of the heifer using self-adhesive bandages (Vet-Wrap7, 3M Corporation, St. Paul, Minn.) and 2.25 cm athletic tape (Andover Coded Products Inc, Salisbury, Mass.). Tym - panic temperature was read every two minutes, with the average recorded every 15 minutes over a seven and five-day period for winter and sum - mer, respectively. On day 28 of each study period, at the time of weighing, ear surface temperature was measured on four heifers from each pen using a Raynger 3i infrared gun (Raytek Cor - poration, Santa Cruz, Calif.). Statistical Analysis Blood metabolite concentrations were analyzed using Mixed Models procedures of SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, N.C.) for a split plot in time design. The model included season, growth promotant treatment, and day (used as repeated measures) plus two and three-way interaction. Unstruc - tured covariance analysis was used for T3, T4, and PUN, while auto regressive (Continued on next page)Page 80 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

Tympanic temperature and ear surface temperature data were analyzed using Mixed Models pro - cedures of SAS for a completely ran - domized design. Least squares means were compared using an F-protected LSD ( P < 0.05). Results For the hot and cold periods, dur - ing which TT were obtained, ambi - ent temperature averaged 80.1 and 26.8oF, respectively, and ranged from a daily average of 63.5 to 94.8oF for the hot period, and 2.5 to 51.8 for the cold period. Mean THI [temperature humidity index; THI = temperature B (0.55*(1-rh/100)*(temperature B 58))] was 76.6 for the hot period and 17.4 for the cold period. Based on the livestock safety index, heifers exposed to hot conditions were on the average in the alert (THI > 74) category, but also also exposed to emergency (THI > 83) category conditions, suggesting cattle were under heat stress during most of this period. During the cold TT collection period, THI ranged between 1.6 and 36.8. A THI < 35 has been suggested as being a cold stress threshold; clearly this threshold was reached. In general, IGF-1 increased (P < 0.05 ) from day 0 to day 28 in the winter and in the summer (Table 1). However, IGF-1 levels declined (P < 0.05) after day 28 in the winter but tended to be maintained at day 28 levels throughout the summer. Thy - roid hormone levels (T3 and T4) fol- lowed similar trends among seasons across bleed times. As expected, T3 and T4 levels were numerically elevat - ed in the winter compared with the summer, but were very similar among season on day 84. In general, by day 84, ambient temperatures were declin - ing in the summer, thus stimulating thyroid gland activity, and increasing in the winter which suppresses thy - roid gland activity. On day 56, PUN was elevated in the winter and low - ered in the summer when compared with day 28 ( P < 0.05); thus PUN tended to peak around day 56 in the T able 1.

In these studies, season x growth promotant interactions were not found ( P > 0.05) for ADG, although ADG was greater ( P < 0.01; 3.18 vs 2.80 lb) in the winter than in the summer (2003 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 42-45). In data reported herein, serum IGF-1 concentrations increased (P < 0.05) by ~ 43% from day 0 to 28 in the summer but by only 24% in the winter. Also in the winter, IGF-1 levels declined by ~ 21% from day 28 to 56, thus returning to near levels found on day 0. In the summer, IGF-1 levels only declined by ~ 9% ( P > 0.05) from day 28 to 56 and remained above (P < 0.05) day 0 level through day 84. Since baseline IGF-1 (98.4 vs 59.5 mg/ mL) were greater in the winter, dif - ferences in ADG are not likely due to the rise or change in IGF-1 over time or among seasons, but partially due to the baseline IGF-1 level associated with the cattle at the start of the study. Also, in the winter, during the period when ambient temperatures decline and approach winter lows, feed intake \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

The ET treated heif - ers had increased ( P < 0.05) T3 levels in the winter when compared with control and other implanted heifers. Across season, heifers receiving ET (ET and ETM treatments) had lower PUN levels. A bleed time by growth promotan t treatment interaction was not found for thyroid hormones but was found (P < 0.05) for IGF-1 and PUN (Table 3). In general, when compared with control heifer groups, ET and ETM treated heifers had greater ( P < 0.05) IGF-1 concentrations on day 28, whereas the ETM and TBA treated cattle had greater IGF-1 concentra - tions on day 56; only heifers had greater IGF-1 concentra - tions on day 84. Thus, the ETM treated cattle had consistently greater IGF-1 concentration during the feed - ing period, which is supported by the tendency ( P < 0.10) for those same heifers plus the ET treated group to have lower PUN concentrations (days 28 and 56) than the control heifer group. Ear surface temperatures were 92.3oF and 56.5oF (P < 0.01), respec - tively for summer and winter (Table 4). The ear surface temperatures were recorded in the event growth- promotin g agent by season inter - actions could be attributable to payout of the implant. Average tym - panic temperature was not different (P > 0.05) between seasons. A greater range in TT was found in the sum - mer than in the winter. Maximum TT was greater ( P < 0.01) and minimum TT was lower ( P < 0.01) in the sum - mer than in the winter. Analysis of hourly data (Figure 1) indicate that peak summer TT occurs around 1700 while peaks in winter TT are not as evident. Also, minimum summer TT were found at 0700. Difference in TT betwee n summer and winter were found at 0500, 0600, 0700, 0800, 1600, 1700, and 2100 with the diurnal TT pattern being flatter in the winter than in the summer.

In the summer, ambient temperature would be peaking around day 56, thus suppressing feed intake resulting in blood PUN being lowered. This de - cline in summer PUN levels could be due to the decrease in DMI. There was no ( P > 0.05) growth promoting agent by season interaction for serum IGF-1, T4, or PUN concen - tration (Table 2). Across both seasons, IGF-1 tended to be increased ( P < 0.10) in ET and ETM treated heifers when compared with control heifers.

In the summer, there was no difference between ear surface temperatures across growth promot - ing treatments while in the winter, the MGA treated heifers had ear surface temperatures similar to control but lower ( P < 0.05; 51.1 vs 58.5 1F) than groups receiving implants. These data suggest that, at least in the winter, implantin g can elevate ear surface temperatures as much as 10 1F, how - ever, overall ear surface temperatures in the winter are over 36oF lower than those found in the summer. A growth promoting treatment b y season interaction was evident for average maximum TT ( P < 0.05) and for average minimum TT (P < 0.10), although the interaction was not evident for mean TT (Table 5 and Figure 1). Mean TT were similar among growth promotant treatment among seasons. Numerically, control heifer groups had greater maximum TT, particularly in the winter, with the MGA heifers having the lowest maximum TT in both seasons. The ET treated cattle had greater ( P < 0.05 ) maximum TT in the summer when compared with MGA fed groups (MGA and ETM). However, in the winter, cattle receiving E and/or MGA (E, ET, MGA, and ETM) had lower maximum TT than control cattle. Differences in minimum TT tended to be found only in the summer, with E treated cattle having greater mini - mum TT than TBA and ETM treat - ment groups. The data indicate that when cattle get hot in the summer, they tend to overcompensate at night by ridding the body of heat (resulting in a lower TT) in preparation for subsequent heat episodes. Thus, the range in TT will be greater in the summer than in the winter. The lower night - time TT appears to enable cattle to prepare for the heat of the day, while greater overall TT in the winter buf - fers the animal against cold threats. The greater minimum TT found in the E treatment group in the summer would suggest E implanted cattle may be more susceptible to heat stress. If E increases TT, the mechanism by which MGA tends to lower TT is unclear, since the growth promoting response of both products are medi -T able 5.

Compounds such as A36, A83, C23, and C39 inhibited methane pr o duction from 14 to 20%, which was indicated by a tendency ( P < 0.10) for treated vials to contain less methane than control vials following incubation. Methane production was decrease d by 32 of the 118 compounds tested ( P < 0.05). Inhibition ranged from 13 (A41) to 100% (C34 and C42).

Some of these were effective at concentrations of 1 mM or less (A24, A61, C33, C34, and C42). These observations indicate it is possible to block synthesis of meth - ane by ruminal organisms by using chemicals that inhibit RFAP synthase. The development of this approach into a commercially feasible applica - tion we will require the identification of compounds capable of inhibiting the enzyme at lower dosages. It would not be practical to manufacture an amount of the current inhibitors that would be required to achieve a 1 mM concentration in the rumen. 1Eric Behlke, graduate profes - sor of Chemistry; Jess Miner, associate professor of Animal Science.T able 1.

Miner1 Summary We identified 32 compounds that inhibit 13 to 100% of the methane pro - duced by in vitro cultures of rumen fluid and have the potential to inhibit enteric methanogenesis in ruminant animals. The compounds are analogous to a substrate in the methane biosynthesis pathway, and may inhibit methane production yet not affect other organisms in the rumen. Introduction Ruminal methanogens consume CO2 and H2, thereby depleting sub - strates used by bacteria to make volatile fatty acids. Methanogenesis accounts for a 3 to 12% loss of feed gross energy. Retention of lost feed gross energy would be a direct addi - tion to the amount of energy available for gain, which is typically 30% of the feed gross energy. Methane is also a greenhouse gas and cattle account for approximately 15% of methane emis - sions to the atmosphere. Therefore, a strategy to inhibit ruminal methano - gens could improve feed efficiency by up to a third and also be environmen - tally advantageous. The enzyme 4-( b-D-ribofuranosyl ) aminobenzene-5'-phosphate (RFAP) synthase, is a key methane Blocking this enzyme could inhibit methanogens. Because RFAP synthase is a methanogen specific enzyme, we expect that its inhibition would be selective for methanogens. The objective of this work was to determine if ruminal methane syn- thesis could be inhibited by analogs to a substrate of RFAP synthase. Procedure Analogs of para-amino benzoate were synthesized in the laboratory. Para-amino benzoate is one substrate of the enzyme targeted for inhibition. The analogs are identified by sequen - tial numbers and collectively referred to as candidate inhibitors. The can - didates were evaluated for ability to inhibit ruminal methane synthesis by use of an in vitro culture system. McDougall's buffer (100 mL), distille d H20 (100 mL), cellobiose (0.5 g), trypticase (0.5 g), Resazurin (0.25 mg), a micro mineral solu - tion (25 mL), and ruminal fluid (53 mL) were gassed with CO2 to create oxyge n -free media. Candidates dis - solved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added to individual 9.4 mL glass vials, in quadruplicate. Oxygen-free gas (H2/CO2, 80:20) was projected into the vials as the fermentation medium (4 mL) was added. The vials were pressurized to 100 kPa (1 atmo - sphere), and allowed to incubate in a water bath (37\u00b0C) for 22 hours. Following incubation, pressure in the headspace of the vials was mea - sured. Methane concentration was determined by gas chromatography us - ing a silica packed column and thermal conductivity detector.

Prosch1 Summary This study analyzes the benefit of Livestock Risk Protection (LRP) insur - ance to cattle producers in reducing basis risk. Nebraska producers insur - ing fed cattle with LRP realize a basis risk reduction of one-third to one-half compared to futures or options hedging. Nebraska feeder cattle producers using LRP experience only a slight reduction in basis risk. Reduced basis risk results in smaller errors when forecasting basis levels for future time periods. With more accurate basis forecasts, producers can better estimate net hedged selling prices and, consequently, future cash flows. Introduction Livestock Risk Protection (LRP) is a relatively new insurance program offered by the USDA Risk Manage - ment Agency (RMA) that provides single-peril price risk insurance coverage to livestock producers. The insuranc e coverage provides mini - mum price protection for future live - stock sales while allowing the user to benefit from price increases. For a complete review of how the LRP program works and how to hedge live - stock sales with it, see Extension Cir - cular 05-839 Livestoc k Risk Protection Insurance: A Self-Study Guide available at http://www.lrp.unl.edu . Using LRP insurance to hedge future livestock sales involves basi s risk just as traditional futures hedg - ing does. However, when using LRP, futures basis is not relevant because price protection is not based on fu - tures markets, but instead on cash market prices. Therefore the relevant basis to consider in an LRP hedge is the difference between a local cash price and the cash index on which LRP is based. Price levels are locked in by purchasing LRP. When the cattle are sold at the end of the insurance policy, the producer receives the lo - cal cash market price and an LRP indemnity, if applicable. The varia - tion between the local cash price and the cash index (Actual Ending Value, or AEV) which coverage is based on represents basis risk, in this case LRP basis risk. Forecasting basis for either future s or LRP hedges enables better estima - tion of future selling prices, which are related to future cash flows. By antici - pating future cash flows, producers' budgeting and financial planning can be improved. Consequently, hedg - ing tools with less basis risk have the potential to improve livestock produc - ers' estimation of selling prices and cash flows. Given that LRP basi s is the difference between a local cash price and AEV and the AEV may incorpo - rate the loca l cash selling price to a small or large degree depending upon the geographic location and market volume, there exists the possibility for LRP basis to be smaller and less variable than traditional futures ba - sis. Less variability in basis indicates a possibility for more accurate basis forecasts. The objective of this study is to compare traditional futures basis and LRP basis risk over time. Procedure To compare basis risk over time, traditional futures basis (Cash Price B Futures Price) and LRP basi s (Cash Price B AEV) were calculated using weekly average price s from January 2000 to January 2005 for Nebraska fed steers and heifers and from Janu - ary 2001 to January 2005 for feeder steers and heifers weighing between 600 and 800 lbs. in 100 lb. increments. Summary statistics were calculated to compare futures and LRP basi s risk. The mean LRP and future s basis indicates how Nebrask a cash prices compare to both the futures and aver - age cash markets (AEV) over time. To measure variability of forecasting basis for a specific week of the year, standard deviations were calculated each week of the year across a mul - tiyear period for both fed and feeder cattle. Standard deviations were cal - culated over four years for fed cattle (2001-2004) and three years for feeder cattle (2002-2004) because of data limitations. These standard devia - tions for each week of the year were then averaged across years to compare the mean futures and LRP basis vari - ability. Result Summary statistics for futures basis and LRP basis for fed cattle are presented in Table 1. The mean LRP basis for Nebraska fed steers and heifers indicates that, on average, the Nebraska direct steer and heifer price was $0.07/cwt and $0.16/cwt higher than the AEV, respectively. The mean steer and heifer LRP basis was $0.36/cwt and $0.37/cwt higher than the traditional nearby futures basis. Thus, LRP fed cattle basis was closer to zero, as hypothesized. The range (difference between maximum and minimum) in LRP basis from Janu - ary 2000 to January 2005 was about one-third to one-half of the range in future s basis. The standard deviation for Nebraska steer and heifer LRP basis was about a third of that for future s basis, confirming that LRP basis is less variable than futures basis . Thus, usin g an historical aver - age for fed cattle LRP basis forecasts likely will be more precise than for futures basis. Standard deviation of basis for each week within the year also showed reduced variability for LRP basis relative to futures basis for fed cattle.

Mean Minimum Maximum Standard Deviation ($/cwt) ($/cwt) 600-700 lb. Steer LRP was $0.85/cwt and $0.76/cwt. The corresponding average standard deviations for futures basis were $1.99/cwt and $1.85/cwt. The substantial reduction in weekly basis variation for LRP further suggests that forecasting LRP basis using the historical average is less risky than for futures basis. Summary statistics for futures basis and LRP basis for selected classes of feeder cattle are located in Table 2. Note that LRP basis for 600-700 lb. and 700-800 lb. heifers was substantially higher than futures basis. This is because the LRP pro - gram uses price adjustment factors to scale down heife r prices relative to steers, effectively raising LRP basis relative to futures basis. The range observed in LRP basis was slightly smaller than the range for futures basis for all classes of feeder cattle except 700-800 lb. heifers. However, the reduction was not as great as for fed cattle. Further, the variability as measured by standard deviation did not decline similarly for feeder cattle LRP basis. In most cases, the standard deviation was only slightly smaller for LRP basis. The benefit of the less variable LRP basis as observed for fed cattle did not appear to hold for feeder cattle. Weekly standard deviations for feeder cattle showed a slight reduc - tion in variability of LRP basis relative to futures basis. The average of these weekly standard deviations for 700- 800 lb. steer LRP basis was $1.72/cwt compared to $2.20/cwt for futures basis. Similar reductions of less than 30% in the average weekly standard deviations for LRP basis compared to futures basis were observed for other types and weights of feeder cattle. This is smaller than the 40-50% reduc - tions seen for fed cattle. So, while feeder cattle LRP basis was somewhat less variable than futures basis, the redu c tion in feeder cattle basis risk was not as large for Nebraska LRP user s as for fed cattle.The substantial reduction in basis variability when using LRP for fed cattle producers relative to futures or options is likely because Nebraska prices represent a greater propor - tion of the AEV on which the LRP insurance contract is indemnified for fed cattle when compared to feeder cattle. The fed cattle AEV, or 5-Area steer price, is weighted heavily with Nebraska prices. Therefore, the dif - ference between Nebraska prices and the AEV (LRP basis) is relatively small and less variable. Basis variability did not decrease for Nebraska feeder cattle prices because the LRP AEV for feeder cattle (CME feeder cattle cash index) does not weight Nebraska prices as heavily as does the AEV for fed cattle. Further, the quality premiums and discounts observed geographically in the feeder cattle market increase the range of prices incorporated into the feeder cattle AEV.Implications Livestock Risk Protection (LRP) insurance provides a reduction in basis risk for hedging fed cattle in Nebrask a . Reduced basis variability indicates fed cattle producers would have less difficulty in accurately fore - casting LRP basis levels for future livestock sales. If producers can fore - cast future basis levels with greater accuracy , they can better estimate futur e selling prices and the cash flows that result from those sales which could allow for better financial planning and budgeting. For feeder cattle users, there is little basis risk reduction when using LRP insurance relative to futures hedging. 1Rik R. Smith, extension assistant; Darrell R.

Kissinger Galen E. Erickson T erry J. Klopfenstein1 Summary Data from 18 experiments (244 pen means) over a 10-year period were sum - marized in order to make a long term comparison between seasons dealing with nutrient mass balance studies and characteristics and amount of manure from open feedlot pens. The amount of manure DM increased from 10.6 lb to 20.0 lb/head finished/day from summer (May to September) to winter (Novem - ber to May). Quantities of OM, ash, and N (lb/head finished/day) increased from 2.5 lb OM, 8.1 lb ash, and 0.13 lb N to 4.8 lb OM, 15.2 lb ash, and 0.22 lb N/ head finished/day from summer to win - ter, respectively. Summer pens averaged 2.7% of N excretion in pen runoff N, and 6.2% of OM excretion in pen run - off, while winter pens averaged 1.8% of N excretion in pen runoff N, and 1.9% of OM excretion in pen runoff. Average N volatilization was higher for summer feeding pens (69%) compared to winter (47%). The implications, which can be used in individualized NMPs, are more total manure and manure N must be handled, but less volatilization of N and less N runoff occur in the winter com - pared to the summer feeding period. Introduction It is important that correct nutri - ent mass balances and characteristics of manure from open feedlot pens are known, so producers are able to develop accurate and realistic nutrient management plans in compliance with environmental regulations. While individual experiments have been presented, no long-term compari - sons have been made across season. Most experiments have not presented manure characteristics or amounts, which is vital information today. The objective of this study was to deter - mine manure amounts, characteris - tics, and variation between winter and summer feeding periods. Procedure Data from 18 experiments over a 10-year period dealing with nutrient mass balance studies in open feedlot pens were summarized. These experi - ments have been previously reported (1996 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 74-77; 1999 Nebraska Beef Report, pp.60-63; 2000 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 68-71; 2002 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 54-57; 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 54-58; 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 61-63; 2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp 69-71; 2005 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 54-56; 2005 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 76-77 ). While nutrient balance data have been presented, manure amounts and char - acteristics have not been summarized. These 18 experiments were conducted in a series of open pens with manure and runoff measurement capabilities. Soil was core sampled before each trial to estimate nutrient concentration on the pen surface. The animals were fed in those pens over the summer or winter feeding periods (summer feeding period defined as May to Sep - tember; winter feeding period defined as November to May), after which pens were cleaned. Collected manure was piled on the cement apron and sampled during removal and pen soil samples were again collected to esti - mate mass nutrient balances after the feeding period. The soil cores from before and after each nutrient balance experiment were used to correct for either manure left in the pen or soil removed at cleaning. Wet manure was weighed at time of removal and samples used to account for nutrients removed in the manure. These pens also contain runoff collection basins to determine runoff from pens on dif - ferent treatments. Nutrients in runoff were quantified by sampling each runoff event, during measurement of total volume. In all experiments, cattle were fed in pens with 350 ft2 per steer and pens were sloped approxi - mately 4%. Nitrogen Mass Balance Nitrogen intake was calculated using dietary N concentration from the nutrient profile of each diet fed multiplied by DMI. Feed refusals were quantified, composited, and analyzed to correct N intakes. Cattle nutrient retention was calculated according to the retained energy and protein equations established by the National Research Council for beef cattle. Nutrient excreted was calculated by subtracting nutrient retention from nutrient intake. Mass balance for N was conducted for each pen in the combined studies. Manure N was quantified by multi - plying manure N concentration by amount of manure removed (DM) from the pen surface. Net core N was quantified from soil core samples collected before and after each trial. Runoff N was determined from run - off collection basins. Total N volatil - ized was calculated by subtracting the sum of manure, soil core balance and runoff N from excreted N. Percentage of N volatilized was calculated as N volatilized divided by total N excre - tion. All N values were expressed on a pound per head finished basis. Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were conducted using Mixed procedures of SAS (2004) to test for effect of season with ex - periment in the model. The 244 pens across all diet treatments were tested for differences across season, winter or summer.

Data summarized in Table 1 for summer and winter pens averaged BW = 791 lb and 724 lb, and gained 477 lb and 602 lb over 128 days and 166 days, respectively. The sum - mer trials averaged 24.7 lb DMI, 3.66 6.34 F: G for the winter feeding period. Table 2 is a summary of data of manure solids and related nutrient content for the two seasonal feed - ing periods. The average wet manure amounts increased from summer to winter, from 15.4 lb/head/day up to 32.9 lb/head/day, respectively. Although the average percentage DM decreased from nearly 70% in summer to just over 61% in winter, the DM amount of manure nearly doubled from summer to winter, increasing from 10.6 to 20.0 lb/head/ day, respectively. This compares to the commercial study data that indi - cated an overall average 73% DM , 15.9 lb/head/day average wet manure, and 11.6 lb/head/day DM amount of manur e (2006 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 94-97 ). There was variation in these values indicated by the mini - mum and maximum range in Table 2. This increase in DM amount of manure harvested seasonally from summer to winter in this study is explained partially by the substantial increase in quantity of soil hauled out of the pen in the manure during the winter feeding period, as reflected in the nearly doubling of quantity of ash from an average of 8.1 lb/head/day to 15.2 lb/head/day from summer to winter periods. This was the result of more moisture in the manure during the winter period and the mixing of soil into the manure as a result of hoof action of the cattle on the wet ma - nure. Additionally, average percentage OM and OM amounts increased from 24.1% and 2.5 lb/head/day to 27.5% and 4.8 lb/head/day, respectively, from summer to winter. The amounts of manure N increased from 0.13 lb N/head/day to 0.22 lb N/head/day, respectively, from summer to winter, corresponding to the increased aver - age amount of manure DM produced seasonally. But, as a percentage of manure, the average concentration of N in the manure decreased from 1.42 % N in the summer feeding period to 1.20% N in the winter period, presum - ably due to the increased amounts of soil removed in the manure from the winter feeding period. In comparison, the commercial study indicated ( 2006 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 94-97) lb N/head/day in harvested manure. N mass balance is a critical evaluation in these studies (Table 3).

The runoff N amount of the summer pens was nearly 60% greater than the winter pens, and averaged 1.62 lb runoff N/head finished and 1.04 lb runoff N/head finished, respectively. This was 2.7% of N excretion and 1.5% of N excretion in pen runoff N amounts, respective - ly, for summer and winter pens. The summer pens runoff OM amounts averaged 40.5 lb runoff OM/ head finished, while the winter pens aver - aged 16.2 lb runoff OM/head finished. These amounts were 6.2% and 1.9% of OM excretion for average summer and winter pen runoff OM, respectively. Although the average gallons of runoff from the winter pens were nearly half the summer amount, the N concentration in runoff from the winter pens was nearly 20% higher than the summer pens (193 ppm N and 161 ppm N, respectively). Overall, the pens in the 18 experiments aver - aged 169 ppm N concentration in runoff. But, the OM concentration in runoff decreased from winter to sum - mer (75%). The OM concentration of runoff was 3020 ppm OM and 4042 ppm OM in runoff from winter and summer pens, respectively. The pens in the eighteen experiments averaged 4045 ppm OM concentration in runoff. There are several implications from this study. Nearly twice the manure is produced on a daily basis/head fin - ished in the winter period compared to summer. More total manure must be handled due to more soil (ash) in the manure during the winter period, in addition to a longer average feed - ing period in the winter compared to summer. There is more volatilization of N in the summer period compared to winter, resulting in higher manure N in the winter period. But, there is more than twice the N runoff in the summer period compared to winter due to increased rainfall amounts dur - ing the summer feeding period. These implications can be used in individu - alized NMPs. 1William F. Kissinger, graduate student, Mechanized Systems Management; Galen E. Erickso n , assistant professor, T erry J.

Average manure N amount increased from summer to winter from 0.13 lb N/ head/day to 0.22 lb N/head/day, with a CV of 51%, but average N runoff decreased from summer to winter feeding periods from 0.012 to 0.005 lb N/head/day, respectively, with a CV of 71%. The average amount of N volatilized decrease d from summer to winter (0.32 to 0.20 lb N/head/day). Similarly, the percentage N volatilized decrease d from 69% in the summer to 47% in the winter, presumably due to warmer temperature in the sum - mer. The 69% N volatilized value is nearly identical to the average value of 70% N loss indicated from data from commercial studies summarized from collection periods across seasons (2006 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 94- 97). There was quite a range of values for percent N loss within season, with CV of 21% for summer, and 41% for winter. Amounts and percentages of N and OM in runoff from pens in all eigh - teen experiments are shown in Table 4. In the 244 pens summarized for the 18 experiments, the 2038 steers aver - aged 145 days on feed, excreted 64.1 lb N/head finished, and 734 lb OM/head finished. The average runoff from each pen was 939 gallons/head. The 244 pens averaged 1.3 lb runoff N/ head and 31.7 lb runoff OM/head fin - ished. This was an average of 2.1% of N excretion in pen runoff N and 4.3% of OM excretion in pen runoff OM. In seasonal comparison (Table 4), the steers in summer and winter pens averaged 128 and 166 days on feed, respectively. The summer steers aver - aged nearly 59 lb N excreted/head finished and the winter steers aver - aged 70 lb N excreted/head finished. The winter steers excreted more OM than the summer steers (872 lb OM excreted/head finished and 657 lb OM excreted/head finished, respectively). Although the length of the summer feeding periods were less than the winter periods, runoff from the sum - mer pens was nearly double the amount from the winter pens (1202 gal/head compared to 643 gal/head, respec - tively) reflecting the higher rainfall amount for the summer feeding period. Although the average precipitation per experiment was 10.8 in. occur - ring in 35 rain event days, the summer pens received nearly twice the average rainfall amounts compared to the winter pens (13.8 in. in 37 rain event days compared to 7.7 in. in 33 rain Page 90 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

Klopfenstein1 Summary A winter and a summer nitrogen mass balance experiment were conduct - ed to analyze effects of feeding clinopti - lolite zeolite clay to steers. No differences were found in steer ADG, F/G or carcass characteristics. Nitrogen mass balance and volatilization were not affected by a 1.2% addition of clinoptilolite in feedlot diets. These experiments indicate clino - ptilolite zeolite clay does not have a large enough cation exchang e potential to be effective in reducing N volatilization in open feedlot pens. Introduction Clinoptilolite zeolite clay is a pro - posed new method to reduce N vola - tilization. Zeolite clay is a naturally occurring hydrated aluminosilicate mined from volcanic ash deposits associated with alkaline lakes. The clay has a high cation exchange capa - bility and permeability rate which may make it effective in adsorbing ammonia. The first hypothesis of this research is the addition of zeolite clay to feedlot cattle diets will bind the ammonia; therefore, reducing the amount of N lost. The second hypoth - esis is steer performance will not be negatively impacted by the addition of zeolite clay to the diet. Procedure Two feeding trials (96 steers/trial) were conducted using 96 crossbred steers. Calves (741 26 lb) were fed for 168 days from November to April (Exp 1) and yearlings (842 15 lb) were fed for 120 days from May to September (Exp 2). For each experi - ment, steers were stratified by weight and assigned randomly to 12 pens and one of two treatments (eight head/ pen, six pens/treatment). Treatments were 1) control diet with 0% zeolite clay (CONTROL) or 2) treatment diet with 1.2% zeolite clay (CLAY). Diets were formulated to meet the steers = metabolizable protein requirements according to the 1996 Beef NRC. Steers were fed a three-week four- step-up program to the finishing diet shown in Table 1. The supplement in both diets used a ground corn carrier which was replaced with zeolite clay. Steers were weighed initially on two consecutive days following a five-day limit-feeding period. Calves were again weighed on days 28, 84 and 168 (Exp 1). They were implanted with Synovex-Choice7 (Fort Dodge Animal Health, Overland Park, Kan.) on day 1 and 84. Yearlings (Exp 2) were also weighed on day 25 and 120 and implanted on day 25 with Revela r -S7 (Intervet, Millsboro, Del.). At slaughter, hot carcass weights and liver scores were recorded. Following a 24-hour chill, 12th rib fat thickness, rib-eye area, quality and yield grades were recorded. For data analysis, final weights were calculated as hot carcass weight divided by the common dress - ing percentage of 63. Nitrogen mass balance experi - ments were conducted using 12 open feedlot pens with retention ponds to collect runoff. Total runoff from each pond was quantified using an ISCO 4230 flow meter (Lincoln, Neb.). Samples were collected during drain - ing and analyzed for DM, OM and total N. Prior to the steers entering the pens, November (Exp 1) and May (Exp 2), 16 core samples of the top 6 inches of lot surface material were taken at equally spaced intervals throughout each pen. Following remova l of steers, April (Exp 1) and September (Exp 2), pens were cleaned and 16 core samples were taken at locations similar to the beginning cores. On the same day pen cores were taken, six, 6-inch cores of settled solid s were removed from each reten - tion pond. All cores were analyzed for DM, OM and N. On the day steers were removed from the pens and sent to slaughter, the pens were thoroughly cleaned and total pounds of manure removed were recorded. As manure was loaded for transport to the compost yard, 30 ran - dom samples per pen were collected for analysis of DM and N. For both experiments, N intake was calculated using analyzed dietar y N content of each feedstuff and multi - plied by total DMI. Individual steer N retention was calculated using the NRC (1996) net protein and net energy equations. N excretion was determined by the difference between N intake and N retention. Manure N was calculated using the total weight hauled and its N composition. Exp 1 manure N was corrected for inheren t cleaning differences by adjusting for soil core N before and after the feed - ing period. Total N in Exp 1 lost was calculated by subtracting N levels of the soil corrected manure and runoff from excreted N. All Exp 1 values are reported on a per steer basis for 168 days. Total Exp 2 N lost was cal - culated by subtracting manure N from excreted N. All Exp 2 values T able 1. Composition of finishing diets (% DM basis).

Results For both experiments there were no statistical differences in steer perfor- mance between the control and clay treatments. In Exp 1, CLAY steers had a 3.4% increase in ADG over CONTROL. The CLAY steers also had a 2.9% decrease in F/G (Table 2). Whereas, during Exp 2, CONTROL had a 1.5% increase in ADG over the CLAY steers and were more efficient with a 5.8% decrease in F/G over the CLAY steers (Table 3). However, these changes in performance were not statistically significant and we conclude the addition of 1.2% clinoptilolite ze o lite has no impact on cattle ADG or F/G. Nitrogen mass balance was not affecte d by the addition of zeolite clay for either experiment (Tables 4 and 5). No statistical treatment differences were present for manure N or N lost. The % N lost during Exp 2 was higher than other reported amounts by Erick - son ( 2002 Nebraska Beef Report , pp. 54-57) and Adams ( 2003 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 54-58). However, the N losses observed in this study were similar to observations by Wilson et al. (2004 Nebraska Beef Report, pp. 72- 73). The higher levels of N lost during the summer, compared to previous research, could be due to environ - mental factors such as warm, humid conditions, rainfall, temperature, or diet differences. Research with other species has shown zeolite clay to be effective in adsorbing N, thus having the ability to reduce N volatilization losses. The lack of a response to zeolite in the cur - rent study could be due to variations in clays used and methodology for assessin g N losses. Also, zeolite clay may not have the cation exchange potential needed for the conditions in open pens versus confinement conditions. 1Dawn M. Sherwood, graduate student; Galen E.

Schulte Rick R. Stowell1 Summary Two experiments using wind tunnels were conducted in conjunction with a N mass balance to evaluate the effect of clinoptilolite zeolite clay on ammonia (NH3) losses. Ammonia losses were measured using the wind tunnels during the last six weeks of each feeding period and compared to losses calculated using a N mass balance. Nitrogen loss, pH, surface DM and N contents, and soil and surface temperatures were assessed as possible contributing factors. There were no differences in NH3 volatiliza - tion due to dietary treatments. N loss was influenced by date, % DM, surface N and soil temperature. As measured by the wind tunnels, 26.4 to 29.2% of the total N loss (by mass balance) was lost as volatilized NH3. The wind tunnel is a useful tool for measuring gaseous emis - sions; however, the short measurement period and small area of measurement may reduce the cumulative accuracy compared to mass balance techniques. Introduction Ammonia emissions are an envir - onmental challenge facing livestock producers. There is a potential for feedlots to become regulated in regard s to NH3 emissions and nitro - gen volatilization. One concern is how these emissions are measured and calculated, and whether the results are accurate. Research at Nebraska has been conducted by measuring N loss usin g the mass balance method. This method takes into account the N consumed and excreted by the cattle. The N excrete d is further measured as manure, soil, and runoff N. However, the mass balance method determines volatile N losses indirectly (by differ - ence). N losses from the feedlot pen surface to the atmosphere are thought to be released predominantly as NH3, and the wind tunnel can be used to measure NH3 emissions directly. The first hypothesis of this researc h is the wind tunnel will enable users to measure the N volatilized as NH3, and that measured losses will be simi - lar to N losses calculated using the mass balance technique. The second hypo thesis is factors such as: DM, pH, soil temperature, and surface N, will affec t the level of NH3 volatilized. Procedure Two experiments were conducted on the effects of feeding clinoptilo - lite zeolite clay on N losses. These results are presented separately ( 2006 Nebrask a Beef Report, pp. 90-91). Wind tunnels were used to sample NH3 release d from pens the last six weeks of each feeding period (March 25-April 29 and July 23-August 27). A wind tunnel was temporarily placed on the lot surface within each pen, and air was directed over the feedlot surface at 0.3 m/s for 30 minutes per pen. Collection was from 0900 to 1400 each day with pen order remain - ing constant throughout both experi - ments. A fraction of the airflow was diverted for analysis and NH3 in this air was collected using a 0.2 M sulfu - ric acid trap. The tunnels were placed in similar locations within each pen (13 ft from the division fence and 24 ft from the concrete apron). The location was determined by a small preliminary study by Ryan Duysen in 2003. Pens were divided into six sections according to surface unifor - mity. Emission samples were collected and a weighted average was used to calculate the representative location for measuring NH3. One-inch core samples were taken at four locations around the edge of the wind tunnel during each measurement perio d . The cores were composited and analyzed for pH, DM, and N. Surface and soil temperatures were taken at the start of each 30-minute run. Each vial of sulfuric acid solution was analyzed for NH3 with a Seal AQ2 autoana - lyzer. The NH3 was then converted to g/head for each treatment (Table 1), accounting for the airflow rate of the wind tunnels, the tunnel and pen ar - eas, and the stocking rate. These NH3 levels were then incorporated into the N mass balance as lb/steer over the entire feeding period. Results Feeding clinoptilolite zeolite clay had no effect on cattle performance or N losses as no significant differences between the two treatments were present in either experiment (Table 1). Much more NH3 was released dur - ing the summer experiment due to an increase in soil temperature and N level, which is in agreement with previous research. Using the mass balance technique, 28.7 and 29.5 lb of volatilized NH3 - N per head were lost in the study conducted in the winter for cattle fed a control diet and zeolite treatment, respectively. In compari - son, the NH3-N losses, as measured using the wind tunnels were 7.7 lb and 13.4 lb of N per head. The estimated ammonia N loss using the wind tun - nels was much lower than that calcu - lated indirectly using mass balance measurements, averaging 35.1% of to - tal excreted N compared to 40% based upon mass balance measurements. Using the mass balance technique for summer fed cattle, 53.8 and 53.6 lb per head of NH3-N were lost using the mass balance technique for control and zeolite treatments, respectively. Using the wind tunnels, 14.2 and 15.7 lb of NH3-N were lost. As a percentage \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved. 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 93 The relationships of DM, pH, surfac e N and temperature to NH3 loss, measured by the wind tunnels, were analyzed. In the spring period, N loss averaged 28.6 g/steer daily with pen surface samples averaging 3.85% N, 74.7% DM and 67.1oF. In the sum - mer sampling period, N loss averaged 56.5 g/steer daily with pen surface av - eraging 4.8% N, 78.6% DM and 77oF. There were significant, but relatively weak correlations between N loss and soil temperature r = 0.36, P < 0.02) (Figure 1) and N concentration of the pen surface material r = 0.33, P < 0.01) (Figure 2). No correlation was observe d between N loss and pH. When the data were analyzed using a regression model, there was a signif - icant effect of date on N loss, soil pH, soil N and DM contents, and surface and soil temperatures ( P < 0.01). This is expected as time of year influences the temperature and moisture content of the feedlot surface. With the use of the wind tunnels, researchers can measure NH3 loss directly from open feedlot pens. How - ever, a challenge with the use of the wind tunnel to quantify NH3 losses is length of the measurement period and area measured. For example, during the winter trial in our study the wind tunnel measured 3 hours of emis - sions total per pen. The cattle were occupying the pens for a total of 4,032 hours; therefore, the wind tunnel only measured 0.07% of the time the cattle were in the pens. Additionally, the wind tunnel measures an area of 3.4 ft2 in a pen with an area of 2,550 ft2; therefore, the wind tunnel only measured 0.14% of the pen surface area. The wind tunnel is a useful tool for measuring relative differences between adjacent pens, presumably. More measurement periods may be needed to obtain a complete and ac - curate depiction of the NH3 released from the pen surface over an entire feeding period. 1 Dawn M.

Therefore, either the NH3-N losses are overestimated by the mass balance technique or the wind tunnel does not account well for total losses over 120 or 168 days.T able 1.

Koelsch2 Summary A commercial feedlot study deter - mined manure nutrient flow in six feed - lots using a corn and by-product based diet with an average P content of 0.39% (DM basis), and a range of 0.34 to 0.48%. Mass balances for N and P were conducted on each pen. The average feed nutrient intake was 0.52 lb P/head/day (10.9 + 2.2 lb/animal fed). Based upon averages from the 6,366 head of cattle, 11.5% of the feed nitro - gen and 16.9% of the feed phosphorus were retained by the animal with the remaining nutrients excreted. The har - vested manure averaged 73% dry matter and 28% organic matter. A wide range of observed organic matter levels (9 to 63%), reflected soil being hauled out of pens along with the manure solids. Based upon these data, 31% of the ex - creted nitrogen or (17.2 lb/animal fed) and 90% of the excreted phosphorus (or 8.1 lb/animal fed) were removed in ma - nure at cleaning. Introduction Revised standards for phosphorus (P) excretion by feedlot cattle have re - cently been accepted by ASAE, which are 50% lower than the previous standards. It is important that correct estimates of P removed as manure sol - ids are available for producers to use in developing nutrient management plans that are based on utilization of manure P. If P content is over-pre - dicted, acres required for appropriate distribution will be inflated. If under- predicted, P levels in the soil may be elevated and excess P may leave fields in runoff. Few data exist for manure P har - vested from feedlots. Previous work at the University of Nebraska suggested that less than 100% of P excreted is removed in manure. It is impera - tive to monitor P flow in the feedlot to determine how much is removed in manure in commercial feedlots compared to the amount excreted by cattle. The objectives of this study were to quantify the phosphorus and nitrogen in manure harvested from open lot beef cattle production sys - tems, and to conduct a mass balance for P entering and exiting a feedlot. This information will help determine if nutrient management plans for feedlots can be developed by knowing the amount of P fed. Procedure Feedlot Study Six central and eastern Nebraska feedlots ranging in size from less than 5,000 head to more than 20,000 head capacity were recruited during the fall of 2003 to participate in a study to quantify manure and nutrients harvested from pens during clean - ing. Each of the feedlots was to as - sign three cattle feeding pens for this study, and to share information for approximately one year on the cattle fed in each pen. The completed study represents 15 feeding pens, 40 sepa - rate lots of cattle fed in those pens, and 6,366 head of cattle in those lots. For this study, both steers and heifers were fed. All calculations were made on a per animal basis and results were presented as amount per head. The period of time of data collection from the pens ranged from mid-October 2003 through December 2004. Feed intake and the nutrient profile of each diet fed were furnished by the feedlot staff or consulting nutritionist. Bunk samples of delivered feed were collected for additional documenta - tion of nutrient profiles. Animal performance on each lot of cattle fed in each pen was determined from data supplied by the feedlot staff for cattle weights in and out, number of animals, and days on feed for each lot of cattle. Each pen in the study was initially cleaned prior to entry of cattle. Ma - nure from feedlot pens is typically removed after a pen of cattle is mar - keted and prior to the next group of cattle arriving. In some instances in this study, more than one cycle of cat - tle were fed in a pen between manure harvestings. Subsequently, feedlot personnel scraped and harvested the manure during normal management procedures of the respective feeding operations. Manure was scraped and piled into central piles within each pen. In some instances, scraped ma - nure was used to maintain the integri - ty of mounds within the pens. As the manure was harvested, gross and tare weights of truck loads were recorded and representative manure samples were collected for nutrient analysis at a commercial laboratory. Manure was either hauled directly to fields for land application, or transferred to a stock - pile or compost yard. Nutrient Balance Nutrient intake was calculated us - ing dietary nutrient concentration from the nutrient profile of each diet fed multiplied by DMI. Cattle nutrient retention was calculated according to the retained energy and protein equa - tions established by the National Re - search Council (1996) for beef cattle. Nutrient excretion was calculated by subtracting nutrient retention from nutrient intake. Mass balances for N and P were conducted as a group on those lots of cattle in residence during the period of time between manure harvesting for each pen in the study. Manure nutrients were quantified by multi - plying the nutrient concentration of harvested manure by the amount of manure removed (DM) from the pen. Total nutrient loss was calculated by subtracting the mass of harvested ma - nure nutrient from the amount of ex - creted nutrient. Percent nutrient loss was calculated as nutrient loss divided by total nutrient excretion. All nutri - ent values were expressed on a lb/head \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved. 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 95 T able 1.

Only variables significant at the 0.15 level remained in the models considered in stepwise selection. In the correlation procedure, all variables were entered, resulting in the production of Pearson Correlation Coefficients. Results Data summarized are for cattle fed from October 2003 through De - cember 2004. Cattle involved in this summary were typically yearlings (BW = 778 lb) and on average gained 403 lb over 123 days. The data were partitioned into two feeding periods: winter/spring and summer/fall feed - ing periods, in order to illustrate any differences between the average values for the two feeding periods. Feed input is the critical nutrient input evaluated in this study. The average nutrient intake was 0.52 2.2 lb/animal fed) for the 123-day average feeding period (Table 1). For an industry average 153-day feeding period, this would amount to 79.1 lb N/animal fed and 13.6 lb P/animal fed. All feedlots were using corn and by-product based diets. The P con - tent averaged 0.39% (DM basis), but ranged from 0.34 to 0.48%. Based upon averages (Tables 3 and 4) from the 6,366 head of cattle, 11.6% of the feed N and 16.9% of the feed P was retained by the animal with the remaining nutrients excret - ed. On average, 56.3 lb of N and 9.1 lb of P (DM basis) were excreted per fed beef animal. Based upon collected data, manure solids contents and nutrient contents of harvested manure were gener - ated (Table 2). On average, 1.0 ton of manure (as-is) was removed per fin - ished animal (15.9 lb/head/day). The harvested manure averaged 73% dry matter (71% during the winter and (Continued on next page)Page 96 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved.spring; 77% during the summer and fall) and 28% organic matter (OM). The wide range of observed organic matter levels (9 to 63%) reflected the amount of soil that was being hauled out of pens. Feedlot surface condi - tions during manure harvest and pre-harvest periods substantially impacted the amount of soil that was mixed with the manure. Percent ash (100 - % OM) is a potential marker for amount of soil contamination at the time of cleaning. Typically, without the addition of soils, 10-20% ash con - tent of the manure would be expected. The data from this study provide an indication of nutrients harvested from feedlots and available for land application. After 123 days in the pen on average, 31% of the excreted N or (17.2 lb/fed animal) and 90% of the excreted P (or 8.1 lb/fed animal) were recovered in harvested manure. The N unaccounted for by these measure - ments can likely be explained by N that volatilizes as ammonia and the dissolved or suspended N in feedlot runoff (5% or less of excreted N). The only anticipated P loss would be from P contained in the runoff, which is 5% or less of excreted P. Thus, an estimate of P recovery of slightly less than 100% would be anticipated. These data (Table 4) indicate an average of 9.8% P loss. Although there is variation, one fac - tor that might explain variation in P loss is feedlot conditions prior to and during manure harvesting. Wet feedlot surface conditions, more common during winter and spring, produce more mixing of manure and soil resulting from animal activ - ity. Wet conditions at harvest create challenges for equipment operators to harvest manure only. Higher soil inclusion with the manure solids may cause manure P to exceed excreted P. With the continuous addition of soil to pens in many feedlots to offset the soil loss during manure harvest, it is possible for P in manure to exceed P excretion. P in manure would also be greater than P excretion if some P was removed at cleaning that was remain - ing in the pen from a previous group of cattle. If cleaning differences exist, T able 5.

Another factor that might explain the variability in P loss is that in some instances, scraped manure is used in maintenance of the mounds in the pens. Manure solids are not removed from the pen, resulting in a lower average quantity of harvested manure from the feedlot. Therefore, it may be difficult to always predict P in harvested manure from the amount excreted. However, these data in Table 4 suggest most (90.2%) of the excreted P is hauled away in manure, at least eventually, and may be a good indica - tor of the P needing distribution to crop land in nutrient management plans. But, pen-to-pen variation should be expected with a coefficient of variation as high as 49%. These data suggest a positive cor - relation between P intakes and ma - nure P. With an increase in P intake, manure P increased in these Nebraska feedlots, and was positively correlated (r = 0.56; P < 0.01) to P intake. One additional source of informa - tion that will add to our ability to manage manure nutrients is the data - base of feedlot manure samples. Few summaries of typical feedlot manure characteristics exist especially for cat - tle fed by-products of corn processing. Based upon a database of 53 samples, Table 5 summarizes average values for N, P, total solids and volatile solids for feedlot manure from these Nebraska feedlots. Another source of information is the comparative summary of average quantities of manure solids harvested from the feedlots in the study. Based upon the 40 lots of cattle fed in the six feedlots, Table 6 summarizes average quantitative values for each feedlot for DM, OM, N and P on a per head/ day basis for harvested manure. Also shown are the average characteristics for percent OM, N, and P. On aver - age, manure harvested values from the six feedlots for DM, OM, N, and P are 11.7, 3.2, 0.14, and 0.066 lb/head/ day, respectively. The data in Table 6 further illustrate the variation which exists between individual feedlots and emphasize the need for determining individual values of P harvested from \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

An interesting comparison of quantity of manure nutrients from beef cattle can be made. The aver - age values for harvested manure N and P from the 6,366 cattle fed in six Nebraska feedlots with dirt pens were compared to values calculated from the NRCS reference (USDA, 1992) for beef feedlot manure from an unsur - faced lot, and were well below NRCS projections. These data indicated an average 0.14 lb N/head/day and 0.066 lb P/head/day in 0.137 calculated from the 1992 NRCS reference for the same av - erage weight animal (980 lb) fed over the 123 days.Although the average 0.39% P con - centration (Table 1) of the diets fed in this study was higher than a conven - tional corn-based diet, the quantity of P removed (lb/head/day) in the manure harvested in these feedlots was 50% less than the amount ob - tained from calculation based on the 1992 NRCS reference for comparable weight animals. These data suggest estimates based on the current NRCS reference (USDA, 1992) of P removed in ma - nure are too high, and indicate acres required for distribution of manure P in NMPs should be 50% of the acres predicted by the NRCS reference. The characteristic and quantitative summary values of the feedlot ma - nure harvested from these Nebraska feedlots are a significant improve - ment over existing standard values currently used in nutrient planning processes by producers, regulators, and planners. 1Author wishes to express appreciation to the six cooperating Nebraska beef feedlot oper - ations which graciously agreed to assist with this study.

Erickson1 Summary An economic model was developed to evaluate cost and value of manure distribution. A 2,500 head feedlot was used as a case study to calculate excre - tion amounts from cattle fed diets with a range of phosphorus. Diet P and subse - quent costs of distributing that manure were used to analyze the corresponding costs of manure P distribution, in addi - tion to determining the required acres needed to be in compliance with a nutri - ent management plan (NMP) based on use of manure P by the crops grown. The model illustrated when animals are fed diets of increasing P concentration, total distribution cost increased, ranging from $2.80 - $5.10/head finished/year, but the agronomic and market value of manure produced increased at a rate faster than the rate of increasing costs of distribu - tion for a small feedlot. Introduction Implementation of P management, as required by environmental regula - tion, will continue to present unique challenges to beef feedlots. Recen t work ( 2006 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report , pp 94-97) suggests the amount of P harvested in manure from beef feedlots varies with 1) level of P in the diets 2) individual pen condi - tions prior to and at time of manure harvesting, and 3) requirements for use of manure solids for surface main - tenance prior to harvesting. These data indicated a positive correlation between P intake and P in harvested manure in beef feeding operations. In addition, previous data ( 2005 Nebrask a Beef Cattle Report , pp51-53.) suggested P excretion is positively cor - related to P intake. It is important that correct estimates of P excretion are used by producers if NMPs are based on use of manure P. Costs of manure P transport and distribution are critical informatio n , but information is limited. The saving s from least cost rations based on a corn processing by-product may be offset by the additional cost of hand l ing manure P. An economic model that reflects P excretion from P intake and retention for individual operations can assist in developmen t of NMPs for feedlots. Thus, the impor - tant objective of our project was to develo p an economic analysis for proper distribution of manure P rela - tive to dietary P and agronomic use in various crop rotations. Procedure Software Model Development An economic model was devel - oped to calculate nutrient excretion amounts from cattle fed diets with a variable range of P, and analyze the corresponding costs of manure P dis - tribution. Software development in - corporated appropriate features from existing models, previously develope d by researchers at University of Nebrask a and University of Missouri, for calculation of nutrient excretion amounts and analysis of manure dis - tribution cost, respectively. Equations used in the model were based upon the revised ASAE Stan - dard D384.2, Manure Production and Characteristics. Nutrient intake was calculated using dietary nutrient concentration of each diet fed multi - plied by DMI. Cattle nutrient reten - tion was calculated according to the retained energy and protein equations established by the National Research Council (1996) for beef cattle. Equa - tions used for beef excretion charac - teristics were based upon a calculation of dietary intake minus animal reten - tion, the approach used by the ASAE nutrient excretion standard.Model Data Input Variables The software is designed to have flexibility of application of input vari - ables. Table 1 shows values assumed in the model as constants, which can be changed if desired. The model allow s the user to enter farm specific information such as average starting and finishing weights, average days on feed, feedlot capacity and turns of cat - tle/year; diet nutrient concentration; manure handling equipment values and capacities utilizing truck or trac - tor spreading equipment; fuel prices, fertilizer nutrient market values; load - ing time, travel speed, and spreading calibrations; various crop rotations; and, land available for distribution of manure nutrients, distance from the feeding operation, and crop removal rates of nutrients based upon crop and yield. Case Study Feedlot Scenario A case study was designed to help define the economic issues associated with feeding dietary P, and the costs of distributing manure on a P basis. In our case study, a theoretical 2,500 head one-time capacity feedlot, aver - aging 750 lb in weight and 1250 lb fin - ish weight in 153 days, with two turns of cattle per year, was used to quantify the manure and nutrients harvested from cattle fed various combinations of diet P and CP. Multiple situational scenarios were identified for analysis of the economics of distribution of manure P harvested from cattle fed diets with a range from 0.29-0.49 % P (DM basis), illustrating a range from a corn and forage base diet, to diets with 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% corn replacement with by-product from ethanol production. Analyses were performed increasing the diet % CP and % P concurrently as by-product % increased. In addition, scenarios were developed for 2- and 4-year applicatio n rates for P with vari - ous CP and diet P levels. All of these \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved. 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 99 for manure application. Thus, the average distance to fields is relatively low in the scenarios investigated. In reality, this may not be the case, but the model has the capability to adapt to individual field locations avail - able for manure application for each individua l feedlot. Likely, at most, only half the land would be available. This is easy to adjust in the model by increasing the average distance to fields variable. Doing so will increase the costs of distribution, and the result s will be more conservative. Equipment Ownership and Operating Costs The model tracts the equipment ownership and operating costs (Table 1) relative to value of the tractor(s), or truck chassis(s), and spreader(s), years to replace, salvage value, depreciation, interest, insurance, repair, and costs of fuel and labor. In addition, equip - ment capacities and swath width, road travel time, field travel time, total loaded miles, and total road miles are variables which affect costs of trans - porting and distributing manure. Costs of Distribution: Costs of Transportin g and Spreading Manure When the farm specific amount of manure P has been established for the individual diet P concentration used in an individual beef feedlot, and the equipment ownership and operating costs have been determined, the model is intended to be used by feedlot operators to estimate the cost of distributing the resultant manure P on land. For individual feeding operations, the costs of scraping the pens, storage, and loading the manure remain constant, regardless the P con - centration in the manure. Thus, those costs were not included in this study and this model. As the manure P con - centration varies, the other variables in the model are distance required to transport the manure, and the neces - sary spreading of the manure to be in compliance with a NMP based on use of manure P by the crops grown. In this model, cost of transport plus (Continued on next page)T able 1. Case study comparison model data input assumed values (constants).

Manure Nutrient Concentration Based on the average values from previous studies ( 2006 Nebraska Beef Cattle Report, pp. 94-97 ), the model calculates annual manure production, and after accounting for open lot or feedlot scraped or stockpiled storage losses, manure nutrient concentration is determined. Crop Removal Value of Manure Nutrient s With the total N, P2O5, and K2O lb/ton of manure determined, the manure application rate is calculated based upon the nutrient use of the desired crop in the specified rotatio n . In this study, for total N, the NH4-N to organic N ratio was set at 0.20:0.80, and it was assumed that no NH4-N would be available to the crop. The reasoning was the assumption, in most cases the manure would not be incorporated soon after surface applicatio n and any remaining NH4-N would be lost. Fifty percent of the organic N is credited for crop use for continuous corn and 32% for corn-soybeans. The model has the flexibility to determine manure appl i cation rates, on either P basis or N basis, as a function of nutrient con - centration of the manure and nutrient removal rates (Table 1) for the specific crop yield of the specific crop grown. No nitrogen credit was given when applied to legumes; the only N value was credited for removal by growing corn. Spreadable Acres Needed The spreadable acres needed to use the annual manure produced were calculated from the annual manure produced divided by the average manur e application rate for the rotation crops. This information is needed in a NMP. The model did not incorporate the cost of additional land ownership, or expenses related to control of added land for manure distribution. Average Distance to Fields For simplicity, the assumption in this case study was that all land near - by the feeding operation was available Page 100 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved.cost of spreading, together are defined as cost of distribution. The output is the variation in cost of distribution of manure P as a result of variation in diet P concentration. The value of the manure minus the cost of distribu - tion equals the net manure value, as a function of diet P concentration. In addition, the cost of distribution per animal fed annually is determined. Results In all scenarios in this case study (Tables 2 - 4), as the spreadable P manu r e concentration increased as a result of increased diet P con - centration, the manure application rate decreased and the spreadable acres require d for all crop rotations increase d . Correspondingly, the total application time and average distance to the fields increased as diet P con - centration increased. The downside of these factors was the resultant increase in total cost to distribute the manure. This ranged from a low cost (Table 3) of $14,000 for the four-year continuous corn scenario with 0% by-product to a high cost (Table 2) of T able 2.

A feedlot will need to have acces s to increased land (up to 90%) and additiona l labor (increase by 45 to 65%) to meet the increased requir e ments for manure application to manage the additional P. On the positive side, high P diet increased the fertilizer value of manure faster than it increase d the cost of distribution. In the case study scenarios in this report, the annual net market value of manure (Table 7) increased in all cases as the P concentration of the diet increased. Tables 5 and 6 summarized the comparison of annual total fertilizer value and phosphorus value, respec - tively, by crop and variation in diet CP and P. There is little difference in fer - tilizer values when comparing 2-year to 4-year P application rates. Likewise, the cost comparison between 2-year and 4-year P application rates change a little, but not a lot, with slightly more expense in the 2-year than the 4-year. The surprise is the increase in net manure value as the diet P con - centration increases. An interesting bench mark is the cost per animal finished per year, calculated as total cost of distribu - tion divided by total animals finished per year (Tables 2 - 4). These values ranged from $2.80/head finished/year in Table 3 for continuous corn with 0.29% P and 4-year P rate, to a high value of $5.10/head finished/year in Table 2 for C-SB at 0.49% P and 2- year P basis application rate. Another interesting perspec - tive is to compare these scenarios on the basi s of net value of manure per animal finished per year. If a true fertilizer market value is placed on the manure and the cost of distribution of the manure is evalu - ated, then the net manure value per head can be determine d by the model. For instanc e , from the case study data (Table 2 - 4), this value calculated from a low of $2.60/head (Table 4) to a high of $7.70/head (Table 3) for net manure value per annually finished animal.

On the downside, there was an increase in application time (Tables 2 - 4) and required spreadable acres (Table 8) receiving the increasing P manure concentrations, due to the decreasing rates of manure application. On the upside, the agronomic and market value of manure produced increased at a rate faster than the rate of increas - ing costs of distribution. This has a potential positive implication to the beef cattle industry, with the 2500 capacity feedlot in this study. Further scenarios need to be investigated with different sized feedlots, and available fields for manure distribution at much greater distances from the feedlot. This model has the ability to investi - gate such individual feedlot situations. The observed benefits of feeding higher rates of distiller by-products can be applied only to the following situations until further investigation is completed: 1. Feedlots with 2,500 head capacit y or less 2. Feedlots with access to 100% of the land closest to the anima l housing 3. Feedlots where manure is applie d at a P-based rate only. In this case study, from the per - spective of cost of distribution/head finished/year, lower diet P concentra - tion is better than higher diet P value s . However, due to the fertilizer value, increased diet P results in high - er manure value. This higher manure value offsets the distribution cost by a range of $2.60/head to $7.70/head finished annually in the scenarios studied in this model. As higher diet P concentrations from feeding increasing amounts of by-products from ethanol production result in higher manure P concentrations, it is potentially beneficial to distribute the higher value manure in compliance with the nutrient management plan. 1William F.

Mark1 Summary This study uses a mail survey to determi n e the value Nebraska feedyard operators place on education, experi - ence, and area of expertise in new assistant manager hires. Using conjoint analysis, calculations are made that esti - mate the marginal value of moving from one level of these attributes to another. Results show that operators preferred higher levels of education and experi - ence. However, relevant experience was preferred over formal education. As an area of expertise, animal health was valued highest by operators of feedyards in all size categories for new assistant managers. Personnel management was valued lowest. Results suggest prospec - tive assistant managers can maximize starting salary by gaining moderate levels of education and experience with an expertise in animal health. Introduction An individual feedyard must balance the need to attract quality labor through competitive wages with the need to keep labor costs low and the operation profitable. Averag e salar y and compensation levels across Nebrask a feedyards indicate that labor costs continue to increase substantially (Unive r sity of Nebraska- Lincol n Extension EC04-836, Nebrask a Feedyard Labor Cost Benchmarks and Historical Trends, Smith, R. R., and D. R. Mark). A better understanding of the value placed on employee characteristics such as experience and education levels or an area of expertise will help employers set salary or wage levels appropriate to the skills they seek. Additionally, by understanding the value of skills possessed by potential new employees, employers could bet - ter recognize valuable attributes of job candidates and fit them to available positions in their operation. Further, knowing the value that agricultural employers place on job experience, educational training, and other employe e characteristics can enable potential employees to seek positions for which they are best qualified and allow them to target their training and experience to gain employment in particular position s in agricultural operations. People seeking a position as an assistant manager in a feedyard will have a better understanding of the traits and characteristics operators are looking for in new hires so they can target their training and educa - tion for an assistant manager position. This study estimates the value that cattle feedyard managers place on education, experience, and expertise for new assistant managers. Procedure In March 2004, surveys were mailed to 198 feedyard operators across Nebraska followed by a second mailing two weeks later. Feedyards surveyed ranged in size from less than 1,000 head (one-time capacity) to over 50,000 head and were selected from Nebraska Cattlemen's commercial cattle feeders list. In addition to ques - tions about feedyard demographics and other general questions, respon - dents were presented a hypothetica l situation in which they were asked to consider 16 candidates for an assistan t man a ger position in their feedyards. The hypothetica l question was designe d to determine feedyard oper - ators' preference for assi s tant manager attributes. The hypothetical candi - dates in the experimental question were considered exactly alike except for four areasCEducatio n , Experienc e , Area of Expertise, and the Salary necessary to hire them. There were four possible levels or areas for each attribute, which are listed in Table 1. Because there are 256 possible com - binations of candidates using the four levels of the four attributes, a reduce d - form design was used to select 16 can - didates with unique combinations of the attributes (no candidates had the same combination of any two given levels of attributes). The respondents were asked to rank each candidate from 1 to 7 to represent their likelihood of hirin g each candidate. A response of 1 indicated the respondent was very unlikel y and 7 very likely to hire each candidate. These rankings were then used as a measure of satisfaction that the survey respondent (feedyard operato r ) placed on each hypothetical candidat e . The satisfaction measure for each candidate was then mod - eled as a function of the education, experience, expertise, and salary requiremen t attributes that candidate possesses. Ordinary least squares regression was then used to estimate parameters of the model for each attribute level. Additionally, using conjoint analysis and the parameters from this satisfaction model estimated with ordinary least squares regres - sion, dollar values were calculated for T able 1.

In other words, it is possible to determine how much it is worth as a potential assistant manager to have a four-year college education relative to a two-year college educa - tion. Similarly, feedyard managers can determine how much more they will have to pay a new assistant manager with a four-year degree relative to a two-year degree. This is known as the compensating variation or willingness to pay (WTP) to switch between levels of a particular attribute. Results Fifty-nine usable surveys from the 198 distributed were returned for a response rate of 29.8%. The average feedyard responding had a maximum capacity of 9,473 head with a current on-feed inventory of 7,699 head and an annual inventory turnover of 2.26 times per year. This resulted in ap - proximately 17,400 head marketed per year for the average feedyard (based on on-feed inventory). The average feedyard had a total annual labor ex - pense of $354,822 including salaries, benefits, and bonuses. Based on this total labor expenditure, averag e labor cost per headday produced was about $0.10. Additional results are available in Smith and Mark. The parameters estimated using ordinary least squares regression for the different attribute levels were sta - tistically significant at the 0.10 level or better. These parameters were then used to calculate feedyard managers' WTP for the various attributes, which are listed in Table 2. The results are reported for all feedyards surveyed and are also grouped according to feedyard size. The values represent a salary tradeoff between the job can - didate attributes and salary require - ment (minimum salary necessary to hire that candidate) and can be interpreted in one of two equivalent ways (Smith, R. R. \"An Evaluation of Feedyard Management Training and Experience.\" American Journal of Agricultural Economics 86(Num - ber 5, 2004):1377-1383). First, the values represent how much more a feedyard operator would be willing to pay a candidate with attribute X2 relative to X1 (assuming attribute X2 is more valuable than attribute X1). Alternatively, a manager would only hire a candidate with attribute X1 if the salary was lower than the salary of the candidate with attribute X2 by the value in Table 2. For example, the first row of Table 2 indicates a feedyard operato r would pay an as - sistant manager candidate with some college but no degree $6,383 more than a candidate with a high school diploma, everything else equal. The alternative interpretation is that the feedyard manager would hire the can - didate with the high school education instea d of the candidate with some college but no degree if the salary for the former candidate was $6,383 lower than for the latter. The values are also additive within the same attr i bute cat - egory. For example, managers would be willing to pay a candidate with a two-year degree $22,747 ($6,383 + $16,364) more than a candidate with a high school education. Based on Table 2, feedyard man - agers appeared to place relatively more importance on experience than education in hiring assistant manag - ers. They would pay a candidate with less than two years of experience $32,959 more than a candidate with no experienc e . This implies a strong tendenc y against hiring assistant managers with no experience. As an area of expertise, animal health had the highest value to feedyard manag - ers relative to nutrition, marketing, or human resource management. This supports the idea that assistant man - agers are most involved in produc - tion phases of feedyard management rather than marketing or personnel decisions. The WTP values met expectations and were fairly intuitive. Based on average salaries reported in Smith and Mark, the WTP values may appear somewhat overstated. Essentially, high WTP values can be viewed as penal - ties to candidates not having a certain attribute. In other words, there is a strong disincentive for hiring the candidate without the attribute hav - ing a high WTP. More interesting is the relative magnitudes both within a given attribute and between different attributes or different sizes of feed - yards. For example, the largest WTP for experienc e was from no experi - ence to less than two years. After that, the marginal value decreased for each increase in experience. This pattern held across all sizes of feedyards.T able 2. V aluation of assistant manager candidate attributes by feedyard operators.

Further, individuals interested in a career in feedyard management can use the results to determine how to best posi - tion themselves in order to maximize starting salaries. A good program for doing so may involve a college degree in animal science or animal health with time spent doing internships and working at feedyards to gain valuable experience. Results suggest programs that offer a mix of formal education and relevant experience in animal health may have an advantage in pro - ducing students who are well suited to the needs of Nebraska feedyard operators. 1Rik R. Smith, extension assistant, and Dar - rell R. Mark, assistant professor, Agricultural Economics, Lincoln.The education attribute showed some variation for feedyards of vari - ous sizes. Across all feedyard sizes, operators placed the highest value on a four-year degree. However, opera - tors at feedyards under 4,000 head placed relatively low marginal value on a four-year degree relative to a two-year degre e ($1,690) than did operators at feedyards with capacity of 4,000 to 12,000 and over 12,000 head ($23,442 and $22,500 respectively). Within the expertise category, ani - mal health was valued highest by feed - yard operators in all size categories. While personnel management had the lowest value for operators in all size categories, operators of feedyards over 12,000 head placed relatively more value on personnel management than did operators at smaller size feedyards. This result was somewhat intuitive considering larger feedyards have more employees to manage. One important point to consider in interpreting these size-based results is that in answering the hypothetical question, respondents were not given a job description as to what respon - sibilities the new assistant manager would have. This left the perceived role of an assistant manager up to the interpretation of the individual respondents. Therefore, it is quite likely that a respondent at a feedyard of 50,000 head would have different expectations for an assistant manager than a respondent at a feedyard of less than 4,000 head. The variation observed in WTP calculations for feedyards of different sizes, particu - larly for the expertise variable, can be attributed, at least partially, to the different job expectations respondents would have for an assistant manager at their feedyards. Implications The results of this study are impor - tant in quantifying the value feedyard operators place on education, experi - ence, and expertise in potential assis - tant manager hires. The values can Page 106 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

Calkins1 Summary USDA Select grade semitendinosus (eye of round) muscles from 12 cattle were used for controls (non-enhanced); salt and phosphate enhanced; water enhanced, or enhanced by addition of 10% of a solution containing 1, 3, or 5% sodium citrate to evaluate the effect of citrate on meat tenderness. Shear force and trained taste panel ratings were not different, (P > 0.05) between controls and citrate-treated muscles. Less than half of the enhancement solution was retained by the muscle. Perhaps the high connective tissue content of the semitendinosus or poor retention of the enhancemen t solution contributed to these results, which are in conflict with our previous research using other muscles. Introduction A wholesome, full-flavored, con - sistently tender piece of beef is of the utmos t importance to consumers when a beef purchase is made. Con - sumers are willing to pay a premium for meat that is guaranteed tender. Treatments to improve tenderness of chuck and round muscles would add value to the whole carcass. Previous research in our laboratory indicated beef chucks injected pre - rigor with water were less tender than control samples while those injecte d prerigor with 200 and 400 mM sodiu m citrate, a glycolytic inhibitor , improved tenderness over the con - trols. This earlier research focused on prerigor beef muscles. Thus, the current study was conducted to deter - mine the effect of a postrigor injec - tion of sodium citrate on beef muscle tenderness.Procedure Meat Select-grade semitendinosus mus - cles from 12 cattle were obtaine d and assigned randomly to one of four rep - lications. Muscles in each replication were then split in half and assigned randomly to one of six treatments: 1) untreated, 2) enhanced by addition of 10% of muscle weight with water, 3) enhanced by addition of 10% of mus - cle weight with a solution containing water, 0.3% salt and 0.3% phosphate solution, 4) enhanced by addition of 10% of muscle weight with a solution containing water and 1.0% sodium citrate solution 5) enhanced by addi - tion of 10% of muscle weight with a solution containing water and 3.0% sodium citrate solution, 6) enhanced by addition of 10% of muscle weight with solution containing water and 5.0% sodium citrate solution. Injec - tion of water and solution was done by hand throughout the semitendinosus usin g a single-needle ham injection unit. Once injected, the muscles were vacuum packed and tumbled for 20 minutes. After allowing 24 hours for enhancement equilibration, muscles were removed from their package and weighed to determine the percent - age pick-up of the enhancement. The semitendinosus muscles were cut in half and randomly assigned an aging period of 1 or 7 days. After aging at 38\u00b0F postinjection, three 1-inch thick steaks were removed in succession from each muscle and frozen. The first (counting from the cut surface) was designated for Warner-Bratzler shear force determination and the second and third were delegated for trained panel evaluation of tender - ness, connective tissue, juiciness, and off-flavor intensity.Warner-Bratzler Shear Force A 1-inch thick steak from each muscle was broiled on a tabletop broiler to a final internal temperature of 160\u00b0F. Temperature was monitored at the geometric center of each steak using a thermocouple thermometer. Cooked steaks were chilled 24 hours at 38\u00b0F, and then eight cores (1/2 inch in diameter) were removed parallel to the muscle fiber orientation. Cores were sheared once each on an Instron Universal Testing Machine with a Warner-Bratzler attachment and a 250 mm/min crosshead speed. Objective Color A 1-inch thick steak from each muscle was cut and allowed to oxygenat e (bloom) for 1 hour. Objectiv e color [L* (measure of light - ness), a* (measure of red), and b* (measure of yellow)] was measured with Illuminant D65 using a Hunter Lab Mini Scan XE Plus colorimeter with a 1-inch port. Trained Taste Panel A 1-inch thick steak from each muscle was broiled on a tabletop broiler to a final internal temperature of 160\u00b0F. Temperature was monitored at the geometric center of each steak using a thermocouple thermometer. Steaks were then cut into 0.5 in x 0.5 in portions and placed in a double boiler to maintain temperature. The panel was specifically trained for evaluating tenderness, connective tis - sue, and juiciness. The panel was also asked to note any off-flavors, if pres - ent. The panelists received six ran - domly-assigned samples a day, plus an initial \"warm-up\" sample to begin each panel. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using the GLM procedures of SAS in a 6 x 2 factorial randomized complete block design. \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

One challenge in this study was the inability of the semitendinosus to retain the solu - tions which were added. Less than 42% of the solution was retained for any treatment (Table 2). This could accoun t for the lack of effect. Tradi - tional enhancement solutions contain salt and phosphate. Even this treat - ment in the present study failed to induce any changes in the muscle. In previous research (Perversi et al., 2002 Beef Report, pp. 85-87), prerigor injection of sodium citrate was shown to significantly enhance tenderness in other muscles. Results of the present study suggest the lack of response to sodium citrate may be attributed to the loss of the solution from the muscle, the high connective tissue content of the muscle studied, and/or the addition of sodium citrate postrigor rather than prerigor. It was hypothesized that the sodiu m citrate solutions might impart a salty sensation, but that proved not to be the case (Table 1). Additionally, the addition of citrate did not contrib - ute to specific problematic off-flavors (Table 3). Further, there were no ef - fects of sodium citrate on pH or color measures, when compared to the un - treated control (Table 4). Semitendi - nosus muscles injected with water or a solution containing salt and phos - phate were lighter in color (higher L*) and less red (lower a*). There were no effects on the yellowness scale (b*). Previous speculation was that postrig - or injection with sodium citrate may increase pH and ionic strength of muscles to a level where increased solubilization of myofibrillar proteins occurs, there by enhancing tenderness and the ability of the muscle to retain added water. This hypothesis did not hold true in this study. Implications Sodium citrate was not effective in changing the sensory properties of semitendinosus muscles. The lack (Continued on next page)T able 1.

Calkins1 Summary Flavor relationships among muscles and causes of liver-like off-flavor of six muscles from each of 30 beef carcasses were evaluated by a trained sensory panel. The infraspinatus (flat iron) was lowest in sour, metallic, and oxidized flavors and highest in fatty flavor. The vastus lateralis (knuckle side) had the most intense off-flavor and was among the highest for sour and oxidized. Heme iron concentration and pH were lowly related to off-flavor. Of 18 muscles from three carcasses, 16 were high in liver-like off-flavor. These data suggest liver-like off-flavor is related to something that impacts the entire animal. Introduction New cuts from the beef round and chuck have gained popularity. There have been anecdotal reports of off- flavors, especially a liver-like flavor, in some beef value cuts. The incidence and intensity of liver-like flavor in various muscles is unknown. Flavor is highly correlated with overall-like rat - ings in beef. With the importance of flavor to the consumer, it is likely that they will not try the same cut again if they have a bad flavor experience. The objective of this research was to compare different beef muscles for off-flavors and to determine the rela - tionship of pH and heme-iron content to off-flavor. Procedure Knuckles and shoulder clods were removed from 16 Choice and 14 Select-grade beef carcasses. Hot car - cass weight, fat thickness, marbling, rib-eye area, and percentage kidney, pelvic, and heart (KPH) fat were re -corded and yield grade was calculated. The knuckles and shoulder clods were stored in a 33. 8oF dark cooler until 7 days postmortem. The rectus top blade or iron), teres major (TER; petite tender), and triceps brachii-long head (TRI; clod heart) were fabricated from each carcass. The INF was filleted, and the connective tissue running laterally through the middle of the muscle was remove d . Each half of the INF was then cut into three steaks. The TER and VAM were left as whole muscles due to size. A sample was cut from the end of each muscle, minced, and retained for chemical analysis. The VAL, REC, and TRI were cut into 1- inch steaks, wrapped, and frozen at -3oF. Samples were prepared by cubing, freezing in liquid nitrogen, powdering the frozen sample with a blender, and storing at -112oF. Powdered sample was used to measure moisture content using a LECO Thermogravimetric Analyzer. A pH meter with a spear tip combination electrode was used to determin e the pH of the muscle. Hemoglobin and myoglobin were extracted using acetone and hydro - chloric acid and then quantified using a spectrophotometer. Frozen steaks were tempered for 1 day in a 33oF cooler before cook - ing. The steaks were weighed and trimmed. Each steak was grilled to an internal temperature of 150oF. Thermocouples were inserte d in the approximate center of each steak. A hand-held digital thermometer was also used to confirm the internal temperature. Steaks were first turned after two minutes and then flipped as needed to minimize charring. After reaching the desired interna l temperature, the steak was removed from the grill. The steaks were cut into 1 x 2 x 1 inch steak cubes and placed in double broilers until served (< 15 min). The trained panel - ists receive d between six and eight samples per session. All eight samples were eithe r from the same muscle type or they were in groups of four from two different muscles. On days that samples from two muscles types were served, a five-minute break was given to separate the two muscles. All steaks were from a consistent location on the muscle. Because of the small size of the TER and VAM, they were cooked as whole muscles. The order of the day that each muscle was served was random and steaks for each mus - cle were served in random order. Pan - elists were not aware of which type of steak they were eatin g . Panelists used 8-point hedonic rating scales with 8=extremely juicy, extremely tender, no connec - tive tissue and no off-flavor, and 1=extremely dry, extremely tough, abundant amount of connective tis - sue, and extrem e off-flavo r . They also identified off-flavor notes including charred, liver-like, metallic, musty/ oxidized, acidic, rancid, and sour flavors. Oxidized was describe d as a \"warmed over\" flavor and rancid was the flavor associate d with lipid oxida - tion. Muscle carcass traits and muscle off-flavor traits were analyzed by analysis of variance using the GLM procedure of SAS. Muscle off-flavor notes within flavor group were ana - lyzed by analysis of variance using the MIXED procedure of SAS. The linear and quadratic functions of heme-iron and pH, as well as the interaction, were included in regression equatio n s to obtain the coefficients of determi - nation. Results Only percentage KPH fat and mar - bling differed between Choice and Select cattle, with Choice-grade cattle Page 110 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved.having a greater amount of both. This result is expected because carcasses are sorted into quality grades based primarily on marbling. Off-flavor intensity differed among muscles (Table 1). The INF had the lowest off-flavor intensity (a higher numerical score) and was among the most tender and juicy of the muscles tested. The VAL had the most intense off-flavor rating s (lower numerical scores) and was the least tender, had the most connectiv e tissue, and had the lowes t amount of juiciness (P < 0.05). This could be due to a \"halo effect\" where a sample that has a good flavor is rated more tender or juicy than one with bad flavor. The INF, TER, and VAM had the highest pH values of the muscles tested. There were no differences ( P < 0.05) among muscles for heme-iron concentration. Liver-like, bloody, and rancid flavors were not affected by muscle type (Table 2). The INF, which had the lowest amount of off-flavor, was among the lowest in percentage of T able 1.

The VAL, which had the most intense off-flavor, was among the highest in percentage of panelists detecting sour, charred, and oxidized flavors ( P < 0.05). Most of the other muscles were rated as be - ing intermediate in the percentage of panelists detecting specific off-flavor notes. When the off-flavor intensity scores were assessed, it became obvi - ous that when one muscle of a given carcass was off-flavored, all muscles were off-flavor (Table 3). Sixteen of the 18 muscles from animals six, sev - en, and nine had off-flavor intensit y scores below five. In an attempt to explore the off- flavor intensity ratings among these muscles, the muscles were grouped. All muscles where at least 30% of the panelists recognized the off-flavor as liver-like were classified as \"off-flavor\" while the other muscles were classified as \"normal.\" There were no group by muscle interactions for sour, metallic, fatty, bloody, or oxidized off-flavor notes. The percentage of panelists detectin g liver-like scores was very high which is to be expecte d , as this is how they were grouped (Table 4). Charred flavors were lower for the off-flavor group than for the nor - mal group ( P < 0.05). This could be because the intense liver-like flavor overwhelms the charred flavor. There was also an interaction among rancid samples that was only significant for the VAM, where off-flavo r samples were less rancid than normal samples (P < 0.05). This suggests that liver-like flavor is not associated with other off- flavo r notes. Regression equations containing the linear and quadratic functions of heme-iron concentration, muscle pH, and their interaction were established for the frequency of off-flavor notes within each muscle for each qualit y grade (data not shown). Within Choice, only the VAL and INF showed a relationship between pH, heme, and \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

There were no significant relationships between pH, heme-iron concentration, and metallic flavors or oxidized flavors for either Choice or Select-grade muscles. Muscles from Select-grade carcasses had stronger relationships between off-flavor notes and pH and heme-iron, possibly because the three carcasses with strong, liver-like off-flavor were Select. Heme-iron and pH explained some of the off-flavo r intensity of the TER, VAL, and VAM (P < 0.05). Bloody flavor notes in the TRI showed a relationship ( P = 0.003) for heme-iron concentration and pH. Heme-iron concentration and pH influence d liver flavor ( P = 0.0003) and sour flavor ( P = 0.042) in the REC. Liver-like flavor in the VAM was also infl u enced ( P = 0.042). Heme- iron co n centration and pH influenced charred flavor ( P = 0.032) and ranci d flavor ( P = 0.042) in the TER. Conclusion When one muscle from a carcass contained liver-like off-flavor, the other muscles tested from that same carcass also contained that flavor. This suggests liver-like flavor is relate d to something the entire animal experiences, like genetics, a feed - stuff, or a pharmaceutical product. It is unknown if muscles other than those tested here would also have the off-flavor. Muscles from the chuck and round have different off-flavor amounts as well as different sensory characteristics. There appears to be only a slight relationship between heme-iron concentration, pH and off- flavor. 1Jessica Meisinger, graduate student; Jennie James, graduate student; Chris Calkins, profes - sor, Animal Science, Lincoln.Page 112 \u2014 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.

Calkins1 Summary Seven muscles from 10 beef carcasses were cooked quickly or slowly and held 0 or 1 hour to explore the influence of cooking rate and holding time on beef flavor. Off-flavor intensity was low - est when beef was cooked slowly (on a 300oF grill instead of a 480oF grill) and when it was held for 1 hour prior to sen - sory evaluation. The infraspinatus (flat iron) had the least intense off-flavo r and the vastus intermedius (knuckle bottom) had the most intense off-flavor. Slow cooking or holding for 1 hour prior to consumption reduced the intensity of off-flavor in value cuts. Introduction The food-service industry has begun to use various steaks obtained from the chuck and the round. Manager s in this industry report an increasing number of complaints about off-flavors in some of the value cuts. Some of the typical off-flavors are described as liver-like, fatty, sour, and metallic. Flavor is a combination of aroma and taste. As a result, some of the compounds that are part of the normal beef flavor may be concen - trated or lost due to cooking. In the food-service industry, meat is cooked and then traditionally held for a time before being served. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of cooking rate and holding time on the flavor of steaks obtained from muscles in the chuck and the round. Procedure Seven muscles ( M. infraspinatus -INF, flat iron; M. teres knuckle side; M. and the M. vastus VAI, knuckle bottom) in the clod #114) and knuckle (IMPS #167) from 10 animals (5=Choice and 5=Select) were separated and trimmed of external fat after aging 7 days postharvest. The thick band of connective tissue in the INF was removed. The TRI, REC, and VAL were cut into 1-inch steaks. The top and bottom portions of the INF were cut in half to make 4 steaks. The TER, VAM, and VAI were cut in half. Steaks were wrapped and frozen (3oF) until sensory evaluation was conducted. Four steaks from one USDA Choice and four steaks from one USDA Select muscle type were randomly served during every taste panel session. Serv - ing order of muscles was randomized. Steaks were thawed 24 hours prior to cooking for sensory evaluation. One steak from each muscle was cooked quickly (FAST) with a grill tem - perature of 480o-500oF to an internal temperature of 145oF and brought to 150oF during a 1 hour hold in a com - mercial food-service warming oven (Precision RS-201, Metal Products, Inc, Miami, Fla.) kept at approxi - mately 165oF. A second steak from the muscle was slow cooked (SLOW) with a grill temperature of 300oF to an internal temperature of 145oF and held for 1 hour to a final internal tem - perature of 150oF. The remaining 2 steaks from each muscle were cooked SLOW and FAST, respectively, to an internal temperature of 150oF and served with no holding time (0 hour). Steaks to be served with no holding time were timed to finish cooking near the end of the 1 hour holding period of the other two steaks. Weight losses from cooking and holding were determined. Panelists for this study were selecte d and trained according to the guidelines and procedures out - lined by the American Meat Science Asso ciation. In order to prevent bias, panelists were seated in individual booths equipped with red fluorescent lights and partitioned to reduce pos - sible collaboration between panelists and eliminate visual differences. Each panelist was served distilled water and unsalted, saltine crackers and given three minutes between samples to cleanse their palates. The panel evaluated the 0.5 inch x 0.5 inch x 1 inch pieces of the eight steaks each session for tenderness, connective tissue, juiciness, and off-flavor inten - sity on with 1=extremel y tough, extreme connec - tive tissue, extremely dry, and extreme off-flavor and 8=extremely tender, no conne c tive tissue, extremely juicy, and no off-flavor. Panelists were trained to identify the presence of specific off-flavors (liver-like, metallic, sour, charred, oxidized, rancid, or other) contributing to the off-flavor score for the steak. T able 1.

Animal served as the exper - imental unit and was considered a random effect. The Kenward-Roger option was used to determine denom - inator degrees of freedom. Main effects of muscle, cooking rate, and holding time and their two-way and three-way interactions were included in the model. When significance was indicated by ANOVA, means separations were performed using the LSMEANS and PDIFF function of SAS. Results The TER, VAI, and VAM were too small to obtain four steaks from the muscle so only the fast cooking rate was used for these muscles. Off-flavor intensity scores for the remaining four muscles were different between cooking rate ( P=0.0007), holding time (P=0.0002), the muscle*cooking rate interaction ( P=0.0237), and the three way interaction of muscle*cooking rate*holding time ( P=0.0121). The FAST cook rate and held for 0 h had the poorest scores for off-flavor inten - sity for the TRI and VAL muscles. The INF and the REC were not signifi - cantly different ( P > 0.05) among the treatments (Table 1). When cooking rate was not included in the model and all seven muscles were analyzed, the same trend was observed with both muscle and holding time being significant, but the interaction was not (Table 2). Slow cooking and hold - ing for 1 hour resulted in the least intense off-flavor ratings. Total weight losses during the cooking and holding were always less for the steaks that were fast cooked with a 0 hour hold for all muscles (Table 3). Perhaps the increased weight loss is improving the off-flavor intensity ratings as shown in Table 1. This suggests off-flavor compounds are volatile and likely water-soluble.

Table 4 illustrates that all muscles had the same incidence of liver-like flavors. Panelists found sourness at a higher frequency in the TRI and the VAL. The INF was found to have the highest response of no off-flavors in the samples tested. The INF has been found to have desirable flavor in sev - eral other studies. Neither cooking rate nor hold - ing time affected the percentage of panelists perceiving liver-like, metal - lic, oxidized, and rancid flavors. The percentage of panelists perceiving sourness was significantly different (P=0.0363) for FAST (25.61%) and SLOW (31.35%) cooking rate as well as charred ( P < 0.0001) and fatty (P=0.0003) flavor. The charred flavor was probably affected by the high cooking temperatures (36.90% for FAST versus 8.82% for SLOW) where more external browning would have formed. The fatty flavor was probably perceived more often due to increased cook loss in the SLOW cooked steaks which concentrated the fat flavor components (SLOW 7.05% versus FAST 2.38%).Implications Cooking rate and holding time play a role in the intensity of off-flav o r perceived in muscles from the chuck and round, especially when the steaks are cooked quickly and served imme - diately. The slower cooking or the longer hold time create more total loss in weight and reduce intensity of off- flavor. 1 Jennie M. James, graduate student; Chris R.

Jenschke Jennie M. James Kyle J. V ander Pol Chris R. Calkins T erry J. Klopfenstein1 Summary Crossbred steers fed with varying levels of wet distillers grains to test the incidence of liver-like off-flavors. USDA Choice steaks, when compared to USDA Select, had significantly higher trained sensory muscle fiber tenderness scores, less detectable connective tissue, higher juiciness scores, and more intense off- flavor ratings. USDA Choice steaks had a higher percentage of panelists denote liver-like and metallic off-flavors. Wet distillers grains did not significantly influence off-flavor indicating these by-products can be used to finish cattle without causing detrimental effects on the sensory profile. Introduction Recently, purveyors, retailers, and consumers have reported a liver-like off-flavor in beef cuts. Previous re - search indicates cuts cooked to higher degree of doneness, cuts with higher levels of myoglobin, and cuts with greater degrees of lipid oxidation typi - cally express a liver-like off-flavor. More specifically, recent research has identified thirteen compounds that were higher in samples with liver-like off-flavor when compared to samples without liver-like flavors. Of these by- products, six were aldehydes formed from the oxidation of oleic and lin - oleic acid. Distillers grains supplementation increases unsaturated fat content of the diet which may subsequently escape rumen biohydrogenation and become incorporated into the phos - pholipid fraction of muscle tissue, thus increasing the possibilities of lipid oxidation and subsequent off-flavors. Our objectives were to deter - mine if feeding wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) increases liver- like off-flavors in beef, and to deter - mine the sensory attributes of cattle finished with WDGS. Procedure Two hundred eighty-eight cross - bred yearling steers were randomly assigned to a dietary treatment con - taining 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% (DM basis) WDGS, where WDGS replaced a high-moisture/dry-rolled corn mixture (1:1 DM basis). Steers were implanted on day 28 with Reval - or-S7, fed for 125 days and harvested at a commercial processing facil - ity. At harvest, university personnel randomly selected 15 Choice and 15 Select carcasses from each treatment group (n=180). Carcass data (hot car - cass weight, fat thickness, and ribeye area) were collected by university personnel while USDA marbling score and yield grade were determined by a USDA grader. Following grading, the knuckles (IMPS #167) (n=180) were removed from the carcasses, vacuum- packaged, and shipped to the Loeffel Meat Laboratory at the University of Nebraska. Following a total aging period of 7 days at 34\u00b0F , the M. rectus femo - ris (knuckle centers) were isolated and cut into 1-inch steaks, freezer wrapped, and frozen (3\u00b0F) until sen - sory analysis was conducted. Steaks were allowed to thaw in a cooler at 34\u00b0F for 1 day prior to cooking for sensory evaluation. Sensory Evaluation Steaks were cooked to an interna l temperature of 158\u00b0F on an electric broiler. Internal temperature was monitored with a digital thermometer with a type T thermocouple. When the internal temperature reached 95\u00b0F, the steak was turned once until the final temperature was reached. The steak was cut into 0.5 x 0.5 x 1- inch cubes and served warm to the panel - ists, approximately five minutes post cooking. In order to prevent bias, panel - ists were seated in individual booths equipped with red fluorescent lights and partitioned to reduce collabora - tion between panelists and eliminate visual differences. Each panelist was served distilled water and unsalted, saltine crackers and given three minutes between samples to cleanse their palates. Six samples, identified using three-digit codes, were served on each day. Eight-point descriptive attribute scales (Muscle fiber tender - ness: trained to identify the specific off- flavor s (liver-like, metallic, sour, charred, oxidized, rancid, or other) contributing to the off-flavor score for the steak. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed as a random - ized complete block design by analy - sis of variance (ANOVA) using the MIXED procedure of SAS with a pre - determined significance level of P < 0.05. Carcass served as the experi - mental unit and was considered a ran - dom effect. Main effects of treatment, grade, and their two-way interaction were included in the model. Since the treatment x grade interaction was not significant for any attribute, least square means were not reported. The Kenward-Roger option was used to determine denominator degrees of freedom. When significance was indi - cated by ANOVA, means separations were performed using the LSMEANS and PDIFF function of SAS.

Treatment had an effect on hot carcass weight and USDA yield grade ( P = 0.0001 and 0.036, respectively). Cattle finished on the 0%, 10%, and 50% diets had similar hot carcass weights, which were lighter than those from cattle fed 20%, 30%, and 40% diets (Table 1). Adjusted fat thickness, ribeye area, and USDA marbling score were not (P = 0.37, 0.08, and 0.31, respectively) different in the present study. Distill - ers grains have higher fat content than corn, which may contribute to higher yield grades. Grade effects for hot carcass weight (P = 0.72), adjusted fat thickness (P = 0.24), ribeye area ( P = 0.95) and USDA yield grade ( P = 0.10) were not significant, but USDA marbling score, as expected, was highly significant (P = 0.0001). Treatment had no effect on the sensory attributes muscle fiber tender - ness, connective tissue amount, juici - ness, and off-flavor intensity (Table 1). USDA Choice steaks were more ten - der, had lower amounts of detectable connective tissue, were juicer, and had a greater off-flavor intensity when compared to Select steaks. Treatment did not significantly influence off-flavor intensity (Table 2), although the frequency of liver- like off-flavor notes was approaching significance ( P = 0.07). The liver-like off-flavor occurred most frequently in the 0% and 10% WDGS diets (14.44 and 19.63, respectively) while steaks from animals fed the 30% and 50% WDGS diet had the lowest incidence of liver-like off-flavor (7.41 and 8.52, respectively). Liver-like and metal - lic off-flavors were more frequent in Selec t carcasses ( P = 0.02 and P = 0.0002, respectively).

All rights reserved.Statistics Used in the Nebraska Beef Report and Their Purpose The purpose of beef cattle and beef product research at UNL is to provide reference information that represents the various populations (cows, calves, heifers, feeders, carcasses, retail products, etc.) of beef production. Obviously, the researcher cannot apply treatments to every member of a population; therefore, he/she must sample the population. The use of statistics allows the researcher and readers of the Nebraska Beef Report the opportunity to evaluate separation of random (chance) occurrences and real biological effects of a treatment. Following is a brief description of the major statistics used in the beef report. For a more detailed description of the expectations of authors and parameters used in animal science see Journal of Animal Science Style and Form (beginning pp 339) at: http://jas.fass.org/ misc/ifora.shtml. Mean \u2014 Data for individual experimental units (cows, steers, steaks) exposed to the same treatment are generally averaged and reported in the text, tables and figures. The statistical term representing the average of a group of data points is mean. Variability \u2014 The inconsistency among the individual experimental units used to calculate a mean for the item measured is the variance. For example, if the ADG for all the steers used to calculate the mean for a treatment is 3.5 lb then the variance is zero. But, this situation never happens! However, if ADG for individual steers used to calculate the mean for a treatment range from 1.0 lb to 5.0 lb, then the variance is large. The variance may be reported as standard deviation (square root of the variance) or as standard error of the mean. The standard error is the standard deviation of the mean as if we had done repeated samplings of data to calculate multiple means for a given treatment. In most cases treatment means and their measure of variability will be expressed as follows: 3.5 \u00b1 0.15. This would be a mean of 3.5 followed by the standard error of the mean of 0.15. A helpful step combining both the mean and the variability from an experiment to conclude whether the treatment results in a real biological effect is to calculate a 95% confidence interval. This interval would be twice the standard error added to and subtracted from the mean. In the example above, this interval is 3.2-3.8 lb. If in an experiment, these intervals calculated for treatments of interest overlap, the experiment does not provide satisfactory evidence to conclude that treatments effects are different. P Value \u2014 Probability (P Value) refers to the likelihood the observed differences among treatment means are due to chance. For example, if the author reports P < 0.05 as the significance level for a test of the differences between treatments as they affect ADG, the reader may conclude there is less than a 5% chance the differences observed between the means are a random occurrence and the treatments do not affect ADG. Hence we conclude that, because this probability of chance occurrence is small, there must be difference between the treatments in their effect on ADG. It is generally accepted among researchers when P values are less than or equal to 0.05, observed differences are deemed due to important treatment effects. Authors occasionally conclude that an effect is significant, hence real, if P values are between 0.05 and 0.10. Further, some authors may include a statement indicating there was a \"tendency\" or \"trend\" in the data. Authors often use these statements when P values are between 0.10 and 0.15, because they are not confident the differences among treatment means are real treatment effects. With P values of 0.10 and 0.15 the chance random sampling caused the observed differences is 1 in 10 and 1 in 6.7, respectively.\u00a9 2005, The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. All rights reserved. 2006 Nebraska Beef Report \u2014 Page 119 Linear and Quadratic Contrasts \u2014 Some articles contain linear (L) and quadratic (Q) responses to treatments. These parameters are used when the research involves increasing amounts of a factor as treatments. Examples are increasing amounts of a ration ingredient (corn, by-product, or feed additive) or increasing amounts of a nutrient (protein, calcium, or vitamin E). The L and Q contrasts provide information regarding the shape of the response. Linear indicates a straight line response and quadratic indicates a curved response. P-values for these contrasts have the same interpretation as described above. Correlation (r) \u2014 Correlation indicates amount of linear relationship of two measurements. The correlation coefficient can range from -1 to 1. Values near zero indicate a weak relationship, values near 1 indicate a strong positive relationship, and a value of -1 indicates a strong negative relationship.
