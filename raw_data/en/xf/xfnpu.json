Here is a list of things that you will need your Healthcare Provider to help with during this process. Please feel free to show them this booklet as a resource. Before Surgery: Ask your Healthcare Provider for letter of support (see next page). Show Healthcare Provider list of medications that will need to be adjusted/stopped prior to weight loss surgery (See page 19). Ask about resources to stop smoking, if applicable (See page 18). Once given a surgery date, schedule a follow -up appointment with your Healthcare Provider for 1 to 2 weeks after your surgery. After Surgery: Your Healthcare Provider will need to monitor your health care conditions. You should see many of your medical conditions improve after surgery. At your 1 -2 week follow -up appointment, your Healthcare Provider may need to ad- just your medications. You may need to restart medications that you stopped before surgery or you may need to stop medications that you no longer need. You will also need to have regular blood work drawn after surgery. If you live outside the area and it is difficult for you to continue your long -term follow -up appoint- ments, let us know. We may be able to provide you with a list of labs that your Healthcare Provider will need to monitor. 11 Healthcare Provider Letter of Support Feel free to show this page to your Healthcare Provider to assist them in writing the letter of support. The following types of providers may be asked to provide this letter: General Practitioner/Internist/Primary Care Provider OBGYN Nephrologist, if you are on dialysis Cardiologist In the Letter of Support, please include the following information: Letter must be TYPED on your office letterhead and signed Patients FULL name and date of birth How long they have been in your care Types of weight loss attempts they have tried (i.e. Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, medication, etc.) Any medical conditions that would benefit from weight loss surgery (i.e. diabetes, sleep apnea, HBP , etc.) Most current height and weight AND calculated BMI Whether or not you, as their provider, support this decision for bariatric surgery 12 Psychiatric Provider Letter of Support A guide for your provider If you have an established relationship with a Psychologist or Psychiatrist, please obtain your psychological evaluation from your provider. It must indicate that there are no psychological contraindications for surgery. For patients that do not have an established relationship with a psychiatric provider, you must see a psychologist/ psychiatrist to obtain a formal psychological evaluation and clearance. You are being referred as a part of the preoperative screening and planning process necessary for all patients entering the bariatric surgery program. By way of this evaluation, we are requesting an assessment in a written format to determine your ability to understanding directions and your will- ingness to adhere to long term follow up care. In addition, knowledge of any major axis disorders or bulimia is necessary. To assess these requirements, standardized psychological testing may be needed. To assist the psychiatric provider, the following points should be addressed: Does the patient appear to understand the commitment he/she is making by undergoing weight reduction surgery? Does the patient appear to have any disabilities that would prevent understanding and following directions? Does the patient currently have an addictive disorder such as alcoholism or drug abuse? Does the patient have a major axis disorder? If so, what? Does the patient appear to have the ability to undergo major behavior modification? Does the patient appear willing to forgo foods as a main comfort source? Are mechanisms present to foster development of suitable coping mechanisms? Is the patient suicidal? Does the patient appear to be sincere in his/her ability to take part in a long -term follow up and group support meetings? In your opinion, is the patient willing to comply with long -term lifestyle changes? In your opinion, is there any reason why this patient should not undergo procedure to limit his/her capacity for food and forced food aversion? If you feel the patient is not ready to proceed with surgery, please list your recommendations instructed to the patient and forward to us in writing. We have a comprehensive program including support groups and available dietitians to help patients in meeting their weight loss goals. Please mail or fax your psychological evaluation to Tulane Surgery Clinic HC20, 1415 Tulane Ave, N.O., LA 70112 or secured fax: 504 -988-1936 ATTN: Bariatric Nurse (fax preferred).

The pouch will be about 30 -60 mL, or about 2 -4 tablespoons. The small pouch and small outlet created by the operation help control the feeling of excessive hunger. Changes in your hor- mones after surgery will also decrease hun- ger. Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy During this surgery, about 80% of the stomach is removed to create a small sleeve stomach similar in shape and size to a banana. The new pouch will be between 60-120 mL (1/4 to 1/2 cup). It is larger than the stomach pouch created during the Roux -en-y Gastric Bypass. The small pouch and hormonal changes will help control the feeling of excessive hunger. Health Benefits of Surgery The health benefits of weight loss are many, including improvements in blood sugar, blood pressure, joint problems, breathing problems, mobility, and overall function. The gastric bypass does a slightly better job than the sleeve gastrectomy at resolving medi- cal problems. 15 Weight Loss Expectations with Surgery How much weight will I lose? Gastric bypass : You can expect to lose 60% to 70% of your excess weight. Sleeve gastrectomy: You can expect to lose around 50% to 60% of your excess weight. What is excess body weight? It is the difference between your current weight and your ideal weight for your height. Current Weight: Ideal Weight for Height: Excess Body Weight: Estimated weight loss with Sleeve (50 -60%): Estimated weight loss with Bypass (60 -70%): Goal Weight: BMI 30, or lbs What can I do to be as successful as possible with bariatric surgery? Surgery is a tool for weight loss. This is not an easy fix. Your commitment to healthy eating and exercise is criti- cal for successful long -term weight control. It is possi- ble to regain weight after surgery if you are not careful. Weight loss is the fastest in the first year after surgery. After that, expect weight loss to start to slow down. Attending bariatric support group meetings is also linked to long -term success. We encourage you to start these healthy changes today. Write down one healthy change that you will start to- day: Unrealistic Realistic 16 Preparing for Surgery Congratulations on your decision to change your life and improve your health. We are very excited to be part of this new chapter of your life. 17 Preparing for Surgery Clinic Visits Before Surgery At each visit you attend, we will check your weight, ask about your clearance re- quirements (other provider 's visits, etc.), and you will also see a dietitian. We want to know what struggles you are having, and what is working well! We are here to help you. Primary Care Provider (PCP) Before surgery, make an appointment with your PCP for 1-2 weeks after your surgery to be sure that you have the right medicines and doses of medicines. After surgery, your medical conditions should get much better, your medicine needs will change, and your lab re- sults will need to be monitored closely. Support Groups Before surgery, you must go to at least 2 support group meetings. We encourage you to attend as many support groups as possible before and after surgery. Support groups are a good way to get information about what to expect. You will be able to talk with others who have had bariatric surgery and those who are waiting for surgery. Research has shown that people who attend support group maintain their weight loss better than those who do not. Also, sometimes during this process, you may feel frustrated or like you are having to live differently than your friends and family. Sup- port group can be a great way to remember that you are not alone. Support Person for Hospital You must have someone pick you up from the hospital and, if possible, stay with you at your home for the first few days after surgery. Before surgery, speak with family or trusted friends who can help you at this time. If you cannot have some- one stay with you after surgery, make sure your home is set up with everything you will need. Illness Notify your surgeon of any cold, sore throat, fever, or any other new illness you develop in the week before surgery. It may not be safe for you to proceed with surgery if you are not well. 18 Preparing for Surgery Pregnancy Weight loss surgery can make it easier to become pregnant. It can also make pregnancy much safer, as we see lower rates of gestational diabetes, high blood pressure and other complications after deliv- ery. However, because your body will go through many changes, it is important to wait at least 18 months before attempting to become pregnant. Please be cautious during this time and use a method of birth control to ensure that you do not become pregnant. If you use oral contraceptives (pills) for birth control, talk to your Healthcare Provider about other methods. Before the surgery, you will need to stop all forms of hormonal replacement for 14 days (pills, ring, patch, creams), due to risk of blood clots. After the surgery, birth control pills may not work as well. You may restart hormonal therapy 4 weeks after surgery. We recommend using 2 forms of birth control for the first 18 months after surgery, if you are able to become pregnant. If applicable, a pregnancy test will be conducted prior to your surgery. Smoking Smoking is very dangerous in bariatric surgery patients because it ... 1. Increases risk of ulcers and severe abdominal pain 2. Prevents lungs from working well 3. Increases risk of pneumonia after surgery 4. Prevents your incisions from healing 5. Increases risk of blood clots (DVT) 6. Stimulates production of stomach acid 7. Reduces circulation by constricting your blood vessels You must quit smoking at least 90 days prior to surgery. We will perform a lab to check for nicotine 90 days after your quit day, which must be negative before your surgery is approved. 19 Preparing for Surgery: Medications Changes in Medications: During your final pre -surgery visit, your surgeon will review with you which medica- tions to stop taking before surgery. Most patients should make the following adjust- ments to the medications listed below: Hormone therapy/Hormonal birth control: See page 18. Extended release/long -acting medications (possible labels include XR, ER, CR, SR, XL, XT): After surgery, you will not be able to absorb long -acting medications as effectively as pre -op. Please notify your prescribing provider to change your medi- cine to an immediate release version. If your medications are not made in an im- mediate release form it is ok to continue taking the extended release version. Diabetes medication : Some diabetes medicines may need to be stopped. The nurse or surgeon will let you know about medicine changes. After surgery, your re- quirement for diabetes medication will decrease. Most people will not need to take any diabetic medication after surgery, and if they need to take anything, it will be insulin. It will be very important to check your blood sugar after surgery (if you were checking before) to know when your medication requires further adjust- ments after surgery. Please let your PCP know if you are having blood sugars <100. Diuretics (e.g. Lasix, furosemide, HCTZ, spironolactone): Most patients will not take these medications after surgery. Consider stopping these medications (discuss with your healthcare provider) while on pre -operative liquid diet, especially if any dizziness occurs. Supplements (fish oil, CoQ10, vitamin E): Please stop taking any supplements besides your multivitamin 10 days prior to surgery . Blood thinners (e.g. Aspirin, Coumadin, Pradaxa, Plavix, Eliquis, Xarelto): You will need to stop aspirin and aspirin -containing products 10 days prior to surgery. The other medications will need to be stopped at varying lengths of time prior to sur- gery. Please clarify with your surgeon in advance so you have a plan for these med- ications. Large pills : You do not need to crush medications. You can take pills in pill form if they are smaller than \u00bd inch. You will need to cut a pill in half if it is larger than \u00bd inch. 20 Aspirin (includes -Steroidal Anti -Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Please ask your surgeon about NSAIDs. Stop taking NSAIDs 14 days prior to weight loss surgery. NSAIDs have been linked to causing stomach ulcers after weight loss surgery. Do not EVER take NSAIDs again after gastric bypass surgery , due to the risk of pouch upset (gastritis), sores in your pouch (ulcers), or bleeding from your pouch. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be taken for aches and pains, or speak to your provider about alternative arrange- ments for pain medications. Your pain should decrease after surgery with weight loss. The following are examples of NSAID medications. This is not a comprehensive list; please clarify with your provider if you are taking any NSAIDS. DO NOT USE: Generally considered safe to use: If you have any specific questions about medications, please ask your Healthcare Provider or feel free to call our office for more information. 21 MUST BRING Consider Bringing Bariatric Handbook CPAP or BiPAP machine (with settings) and mask if you have sleep apnea Incentive spirometer Friend or family member Loose, comfortable clothing to wear home Photo ID ALL MEDICATIONS Tank top to wear under abdominal binder Biotene mouth wash for dry mouth Knee -length bathrobe Hand lotion Comb or brush Lip balm Soft Kleenex Toothbrush and toothpaste Deodorant Women: Supplies for your menstrual cycle Contact lens supplies **DO NOT BRING VALUABLES Your Time in the Hospital: Day of Surgery Before you arrive to the hospital: Be sure to shower with an antibacterial soap Remove all nail polish Do not put on lotions, creams, hair products, or makeup Remove all jewelry and body piercings, and leave them at home Wear loose, comfortable clothing and non -slip shoes that are easy to take on and off Pull long hair back in an elastic band (no metal) Take only the medications that have been approved by the surgeon or anesthesiologist with small sips of water After you arrive to the hospital: Check -in: You will check in to the hospital using your photo ID. You must arrive at least 2 hours before your surgery (someone will call you with the exact time of arrival). Outpatient Surgery (OPS): This is where you will be prior to surgery. Someone will start an intra- venous (IV) line in this area and prepare you for surgery. The Operating Room (OR): This is the room where surgery takes place. You will be wheeled in to the OR on a stretcher and will move to the OR table. Everyone in the room will make sure you are comfortable, and the anesthesia provider will give you medications to make you unconscious. After you are safely under anesthesia, we will carefully position you and perform the operation. The Recovery Room: After surgery, you will be moved to the recovery room. You will be in the re- covery room for about 2 hours before being moved to a regular hospital room. You should start walking and using your incentive spirometer as soon as you are awake. Your surgeon will give your support person an update as soon as you are out of surgery. 22 Your Time in the Hospital: After Surgery How will you feel When you wake up, you will feel groggy as the anesthesia wears off. You may also have some pain or feel bloated - this is normal. Walking around will help with the bloating. If your pain is preventing you from walking or taking deep breaths, ask your nurse for more pain medica- tion. Sometimes, people feel dizzy or have blurry vision; please let your nurse know if this happens. You may notice you have to urinate more than usual. It takes about 3 days to get rid of the extra fluid we gave you during surgery. When can you start drinking You can start drinking 1 ounce (one medicine cup) of ice/water every 15 minutes as soon as you are awake enough to drink. You must sip slowly and not drink more than 4 ounces per hour until further instruction. Walking/ Exercise Walking lowers the chance of blood clots and pneumonia. The first time you get out of bed is usually the hardest, so ask someone to help you. You should start walking as soon as you are awake enough in the recovery room . You should continue to walk around the unit every 1 -2 hours while you are awake. You must exercise your feet and legs every hour, even while lying in bed, to lower the risk of blood clots. While in bed, you can exercise by pointing and flexing your feet, as if you are pushing a gas pedal on a car. Getting out of bed and walking is the best way to exercise your legs and circulate blood. 23 Your Time in the Hospital: After Surgery Leg compression devices You must wear compression devices on your legs while you are sleeping or resting in bed. You can take off the compression devices while walking, sitting, or using the bathroom. These help prevent blood clots. Deep Breathing You will need to breathe deeply and cough. Use the incentive spi- rometer every hour when you are awake during your hospital stay. You should take at least 10 slow, deep breaths with the device each hour. Breathing deeply helps your lungs expand, which helps lower your risk of pneumonia. Family/ friends Arrange for a responsible adult (spouse, family member, or close friend) to drive you to the hospital and stay at the hospital until you are out of surgery. Someone must pick you up from the hospi- tal to be discharged - please make a plan. You cannot leave the hospital by yourself. Use incentive spirometer 10 times an hour. A good way to remember is to do several deep breaths at every commercial break as you watch TV! 24 Leaving the Hospital and Going Home Length of Stay Most people will spend 1 -2 nights in the hospital. You will be able to go home when it is clear that you can tolerate at least 4 ounces of fluid every hour, your pain is controlled, and you are not having any problems. Preparing your home Give some thought to your home and grocery needs before surgery: You need to have protein drinks at your home to drink after surgery. It can be helpful to have someone stay with you at your home for the first few days after surgery. Drive home You will need someone to drive you home from the hospital. If you live more than 60 minutes from the hospital, you must get out of the car every 60 minutes and walk around the car 3 or 4 times. You are still at a high risk for blood clots. When you are sitting in the car, you can exercise by pointing and flexing your feet \u2014 pretend you are pushing the car's gas pedal and then lift your toes toward your knees. 25 Leaving the Hospital and Going Home Activity Do not lift anything heavier than 10 pounds until your surgeon says it is okay (usually 4 weeks for gastric bypass and 6 weeks for sleeve). Your incisions need time to heal. Lifting too early can put you at risk for a hernia, which is when an organ or tissue squeezes through a weak spot in the abdominal wall. You may go up and down stairs. You may drive when you have had no pain medicine for 24 hours and are able to move around comfortably in the vehicle. The only exercises that are allowed for the first 2 weeks are walking and riding a stationary bike. You should walk as much as you feel you can, as soon as you go home. Do not stand or sit in the same position for long periods of time. You should use your incentive spirometer until you are back to your normal activity level. Do 10 slow, deep breaths, 4 times a day. Sexual Activity You may have sexual activity when you feel physically able. For people with pregnancy potential, use 2 reliable methods of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. To give your body time to heal, you should not get pregnant for 18 months after surgery. Returning to work Most patients return to work 2 weeks after surgery, but every patient is different. If you need a return - to-work note, please ask us at your first post - operative clinic visit. At that visit, we will have a better idea of how you are doing and when you can return to work. 26 After Surgery Knowing what to expect as you recover can make the process easier and less stress- ful. Below you will see a list of symptoms you may have during recovery, and tips on dealing with them. Pain You may have soreness or pain after surgery. We recommend using your abdominal binder, if it feels comfortable. If it makes your discomfort worse, please feel free to remove it. Also, we will provide you with multiple medications for pain. We will re- view these medications with you individually before you leave the hospital. If you are given a narcotic medication, it will be important to stop this medicine first as you recover, as it can cause severe constipation. Constipation Constipation can be a serious complication of surgery. It can be caused by drinking less fluids, taking pain medicine, and being less active. Once your diet is advanced to softer foods, your bowel movements should become more consistent. You need to make sure you are taking in at least 64 ounces of water every day to stay hydrated and keep from getting constipated. If you do not have a bowel movement for 3 days, contact us. You may take Milk of Magnesia, Dulcolax, Magnesium Citrate, or Smooth Move Tea according to the directions on the bottle to help get your bowels moving again. If you are more than one month post -op, Miralax is a better option. Walking will help the bowels work better. Remember to walk a lot. Diarrhea Diarrhea can have many causes. Please contact us if you have diarrhea. 27 After Surgery Feeling sick to your stomach (nausea) You may have nausea, but it usually goes away soon after surgery. Most of the time nausea is caused by not having enough fluids in your body (dehydration). You need 64 ounces of water every day. Some patients feel nauseated because of sinus drainage and may throw up clear, frothy mucus. Drinking a cup of warm decaf tea first thing in the morning can help clear the drainage from your pouch. If you continue to throw up, call the office. Other causes of nausea include increased sensitivity to odors, eating and drinking too quickly, drinking with meals, and increased acid in the stomach. Sometimes decaf herbal tea with ginger, mint or chamomile can help calm your stomach. Sensitivity to odors will go away with time. Do not drink carbonated beverages and do not sip through a straw! Throwing Up (vomiting) Vomiting is usually caused by eating too quickly, taking large bites of food, not chew- ing food well enough, drinking during meals, and over -eating. You will feel full quickly after surgery. Take your time, take dime - sized bites, and chew your food well. Call the office if you vomit, especially if you have pain with vomiting. Vomiting can lead to dehydration, which can be a serious health problem (see page 42). Caffeine -Free Tea AVOID: 28 Bruising or Swelling Some bruising and swelling is normal after surgery. Contact us if you have a lot of bruising or swelling or if it gets worse. You may feel a small lump in the incision; this is normal. Hair loss Hair loss is common with rapid weight loss. The hair loss is temporary and your hair should grow back. Hair loss usually begins around three months after surgery and lasts until around nine months. Good amounts of protein along with a wide variety of healthy foods will help correct hair loss. You may take an over -the-counter hair growth supplement. If you feel you need this, contact your dietitian. Scars It is normal for your scars to be red or dark pink. Scars are red because blood vessels are still working in the healing process. It takes the scar about a year to completely heal. Numbness Nerves to the skin are sometimes cut with surgery. It is normal to experi- ence numbness at the incision site. Sensation at those areas will return slowly over time. Decreased Energy It is normal to feel tired after surgery. You must keep in mind that you have just undergone major surgery. Drinking lots of water and walking as you are able will help improve your energy. Once you are able to incor- porate protein, this will also help your energy levels. After Surgery 29 After Surgery If you are concerned that your symptoms are not normal or are getting worse, please call the clinic at: (504) 988 -5110. Please remember to call us right away if you have: A temperature of more than 101\u00b0 F (38.3\u00b0 C) Increased redness or swelling at your incision sites Cloudy or bloody drainage from the incision Pain not improved by your pain medicine, or worsening pain Vomiting Diarrhea Shortness of breath Heart racing or palpitations 30 Exercise Exercise will improve weight loss, tone muscles, and reduce loss of muscle mass. A re- cent study showed that exercise is the most important factor in maintaining weight loss. Don't wait until you have hit a plateau to include exercise in your daily routine! Remember that exercise should be approved by your physician. In General: 20-30 min of activity per day Aerobic Activity: 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week OR 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week 1 minute of vigorous activity provides similar health benefits as 2 minutes of moderate activity Strength Training: All major muscle groups at least 2x/week (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, arms) Reduce Sitting Time: Stand every 30 minutes to reduce health risks and improve longevity (sitting is the new smok- ing!) To Start: Figure out what you like and are most likely to do Do you prefer to work out with others? Do you want to exercise before, during or after work? Do you like to dance, swim, lift weights, ride a bike? Figure out what you want to do. Set a specific, reasonable goal (ex. Sign up for a 5K and start walk/jogging at least 2x/week). To Stay Focused and Maintain a Habit: It takes about 30 days to form a habit, so stay consistent for about a month Put your clothes out the night before or change to gym clothes at work Pair exercise with non -food rewards (ex. do you like Netflix? Allow yourself to watch ONLY if you go to the gym) Park further away in the parking lot and walk to your destination March in place during TV commercials Listen to your favorite motivational music as you exercise Take a flight of stairs instead of the elevator Keep a record or journal to hold yourself accountable Ask a friend or family member to participate with you Vary workouts to alleviate boredom Develop specific, realistic, and achievable goals Check out exercise apps on phone 31 32 Patient Portal The Patient portal is not intended for use in emergencies.

To be successful with losing weight and keeping it off, you must change your eating and exercise habits and start practic- ing now. You will need to make these changes and reach your weight loss goal/or not gain any weight over the duration of the program. EATING CHANGES Utilize the Plate Method and begin reducing starch intake : We recommend using The Plate Method as a guide to help with weight loss, to create healthy eating habits, and prepare you for diet after surgery. Use a dinner plate no more than 9 -10 inches in diameter. Make half of your plate non -starchy vegetables, choose 3 ounces of lean protein, and limit starches. Always start by eating PRO- TEIN FIRST, NON -STARCHY VEGETABLES SECOND, and if you still feel hungry, STARCH THIRD (page 40). You will work your way towards STARCH FREE a mini- mum of one month prior to surgery (page 54). EAT 3 meals per day (ma y have additional snacks to meet protein goals): You will not be able to fit your daily protein needs in one meal, it is best to start practicing eating 3 meals a day now. Your body needs protein to heal. You may supplement with snacks to achieve protein goals. Plan your meals and snacks and measure portions: Preparing for your meals will allow you to have quick healthy choices when you are hungry. Understanding food labels (page 43) and measuring portions will help you understand exactly what you are eating. You should use the nutrition facts label to help determine portion size, which will also help prevent under/over -eating. You should avoid eating between planned meals and snacks. Avoid foods that are high in sugar and fat: The foods on the following list should be avoided because they hinder weight loss and can cause dumping syn- drome after surgery (page 44). Breaded and/or fried foods (including fried seafood) High -fat meat (bologna, salami, pepperoni, hot dog, bacon, sau- sage, andouille, boudin, etc.) Added fat used in cooking (butter, oil, grease, lard , pickled meats, etc.) Salad dressings, creamy sauces, and gravies Smoothies and fruit juice Sweets and desserts (cakes, ice cream, frozen yogurt, cookies, candy, etc.) Full-fat condiments (mayonnaise, salad dressings, sauces, gravies, etc.) 36 Eating Changes: Continued Chew your food thoroughly: Eating too quickly and chewing incompletely will cause pain, vomiting, and irritation to your new pouch. You should take small bites and chew each bite 25 -30 times until it has an \"applesauce \" consistency prior to swallowing. Your new stomach will be much smaller than its original size, and food will pass easier if it is chewed very well. Eat slowly: It is best if meals take 30 -40 minutes to eat. Try putting your utensils down after each bite to help slow the process down and prevent overfilling your stomach. This will help reduce complications and the feeling of food being stuck. However, eating should not take longer than 40 minutes; otherwise you are at risk of eating too many calories. Avoid overeating: It is extremely important to stop eating at the first sign of full- ness. Your meal portions may range from 1/4 cup -1/2 cup for the first few months after surgery. Overeating can lead to discomfort, vomiting, and stretching of your stomach. The difference between comfort and discomfort can be one bite. You will have to re -learn the feelings of fullness and hunger with your new pouch after surgery. Start developing your mind -body connection today. If food feels like it is stuck sit up straight, walk to help move it through and try a papaya enzyme to help break it up. Stop when you feel full here Don't wait until you are full here 37 Drinking Changes Drink fluids slowly: After surgery you will not be able to gulp or chug fluid . Gulp- ing more than 1 ounce of liquid may cause pain; this will require you to slowly sip fluids all day. Do not drink your liquids with a straw after your surgery , as air will be swallowed, causing painful gas and irritation to the stomach. Eat without drinking: Starting with the soft food phase of the diet, do not drink 30 minutes before you eat and do not drink until 30 minutes after you finish eating . Drinking prior to your meal will fill your pouch and prevent you from eating enough food. Drinking during or after meals will flush the food too quickly out of your pouch and cause you to become hungry faster and possibly eat too many calories. This is explained very well in this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/ xR0VM3mnsgM Cut down on caffeine and carbonated beverages: Caffeine acts as a diuretic and can irritate the lining of the stomach. You should eliminate caffeine for the first month, after surgery and should limit to 16 ounces (2 cups) per day after that. You will not be able to have carbonation after surgery, carbonated (bubbly) beverages release gas that can cause pain as the pouch expands. Cutting car- bonation from your lifestyle will be a permanent behavior. Choose low -calorie beverages : All beverages except protein drinks should have fewer than 10 calories per serving. Calories from drinks can add up quickly and can cause weight gain. Always read food labels, because even healthy looking drinks may have many calories and a lot of sugar (page 43). Avoid Alcohol After Surgery : It is recommended that you avoid alcohol after surgery because it ... Increases operative risks Is high in calories, dehydrating, and has no nutritional value May reduce maximal weight loss success Is rapidly absorbed after surgery and your sensitivity (tolerance) levels are re- duced Can cause Dumping Syndrome because of high sugar content Avoid alcohol for the first 1 year after surgery. If you choose to drink, do so in moderation (1 drink, 1 -4 times a year). Once again, your tolerance will likely be very low, so be careful trying alcohol again. 38 Other Nutrition Changes Find supplements/protein you like: After surgery you will need to take vita- mins; including a multivitamin, calcium citrate, and possibly other supplements. Start taking your multivitamin now (page 46) to make sure your vitamin levels are normal before surgery. Begin sampling calcium citrate options (page 47) and pro- tein drinks/mixes (page 49) to make sure you know which brands you like before surgery. You will need to take Calcium citrate and a bariatric approved multivita- min for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. Renal Patients: If you are following a Renal diet, continue fol- lowing your specific recommendations with the addition of Plate Method guidelines. If you are being followed by a Dialysis Center or a Renal Provider, please speak with that medical team regard- ing protein goals, fluid needs, and vitamin/mineral recommen- dations after bariatric surgery. Food Journal: It is extremely important to know what you are eating. Many people lose weight just by understanding how many calories are in their food. You should bring your food jour- nal to each appointment to help your surgeon and dietitian un- derstand how to help you improve your weight loss experience. Exercise: Your weight loss will be greater if you can incorporate exercise into your daily routine. You do not want to hurt your- self; therefore it is important to start slowly. The exercise goal for sustained weight loss maintenance is about 150 minutes per week (page 30). Detoxify your kitchen: Clean out your kitchen cabinets. Get rid of foods that might tempt you after surgery. It is important that you include your family (or members of your support system) in this process. Educate them on foods that are part of your bari- atric diet plan and foods that are not. Have a good support system in place: There are many adjust- ments to make after surgery. It is very common for some family and friends to express concerns about surgery. Look for an un- derstanding and supportive friend, family member, co -worker, etc. with whom you can talk. Our support groups are a great place to find support as well. Developing a healthy relationship with food, learning to manage stress, and improving self -esteem may call for the help of a professional counselor. 39 NUTRITION Part 2: Plate Method (Start Now) 40 Protein: Eat 1st Non -Starchy Vegetables: Eat 2nd Starch/ Fruit: Eat 3rd Non -Starchy Veggies Should fill half your plate Artichokes Asparagus Bamboo shoots Bean Sprouts all varieties Radishes Rutabaga Salad Greens Sugar snap peas Swiss chard Tomato Turnips Zucchini Starch/Fruit Limit to 1 serving Fruit , \u00bd cup or 1 small fruit Dried fruit, 2 Tbsp Corn, \u00bd cup Green peas, \u00bd cup Potato, \u00bd cup, or \u00bd me- dium Sweet potato, \u00bd cup \u00be cup Beans, \u00be cup Grits, \u00bd cup Bread, 1 slice or 1 roll Biscuit, 1 small Waffle 1 small - 4\" Tortilla, 1 small - 6\" Pasta, 1/3 cup Rice, 1/3 cup Crackers, 5 Popcorn, 1 cup See page 54 for longer list The Plate Method Protein Choose 3 -4 oz (size of a deck of cards) Lean meat Chicken Turkey Fish Shellfish Eggs Cottage Cheese See page 41 for longer list We recommend using the plate method as a guide to help with weight loss and to cre- ate good eating habits prior to surgery.

Protein is extremely important for healing after surgery, maintaining muscle, preventing hair loss, and preventing hunger between meals. Eat protein FIRST at all meals and snacks. Protein Tips: Look for LEAN options on the label: ground lean, tenderloin, tip, loin, sirloin, round, 97/3. Choose: baked, grilled, seared, smoked, steamed, and pressed. AVOID FRIED! Add meat, poultry, fish, soy/tofu and eggs to veggies, soups, and salads. Use plain Greek yogurt or cottage cheese instead of mayo, sour cream, cream cheese, and heavy cream in tuna salad, egg salad, chicken salad, dips, soups, sauces, and hot cereals. Add non-fat dry milk powder or unflavored protein powder to sauces, soups, sugar -free pud- ding, low -sugar yogurt, and hot cereals. Meeting Protein Needs Meeting Fluid/Hydration Needs Daily Fluid Needs: 64 oz of sugar free/decaffeinated fluids daily This goal may be different for you if you are on a provider -recommended fluid restriction. Maintaining proper hydration is important to prevent dehydration. Dehydration is the loss of body water and is a risk for you, especially during the first few months following surgery and in the warm months. Dehydration Symptoms: Nausea Sluggishness Constipation Lightheadedness Muscle cramps Dark -colored urine Urinating < 4 times/day Small amount of urine Strong feeling of thirst and/or dry mouth (often occurs too late) Tips to maintain proper hydration: Drink fluids all throughout the day Try to get at least \u00bd cup to 1 cup (4 -8 oz) of fluid each hour Always keep fluids with you Always sip slowly and avoid straws Drink more on hot days and when exercising Never leave home without your water bottle! No carbonated beverages No sugar -sweetened beverages Be calorie -conscious Limit caffeinated drinks to 2 cups per day 43 Nutrition Labels Learning how to read a food label is important for lifelong success. ALWAYS read food labels. SERVING SIZES: Are usually less than most people think. Make sure you account for servings per container. CALORIES: There is no precise measurement of calories after surgery, however, it is likely you will end up between 800 - 1200 calories per day. Use the Baritastic App to track your nutrition! FAT: 35 grams per day or less. Fat should be lower than protein per serving. Limit foods that have more fat than protein, such as bologna, salami, boudin, pepperoni, hot dogs, bacon, sausage, pea- nut butter, nuts, seeds, and full -fat dairy CARBOHYDRATES: <50 net per day during starch free and 50 -100 grams per day after 6 months OR remove all starches and automatically be low carb. See page 54. Net Carbs = Total Carbs MINUS Fiber and Sugar Alcohols FIBER: When eating starch, look for foods higher in FIBER , aiming for 25-38 grams daily. SUGAR: Everything should be 5 grams or less of TO- TAL SUGAR (per serving) EXCEPT yogurt or fruit products, these should be less than 10 grams of sug- ar. All drinks should have 1 gram of sugar or less. Don't assume a product does not contain sugar. See Dumping Syndrome on page 44. PROTEIN: 70-100 grams per day , 25-35 grams per meal. Look for products with more grams of PROTEIN than grams of sugar and fat. A GOOD source of protein has at least 8 g of protein per 100 calories. % DAILY VALUE: Based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Do not focus on percentages, focus on grams of nutri- ents. TIP: Most restaurants offer nutrition facts online. Look up some of your favorite food choices and see if there is something lower in calories, fat, and sugar that would be just as satisfying. 44 What is Dumping Syndrome? Dumping syndrome is a group of symp- toms that occur when food or liquid passes too quickly from the stomach into the small intestine. When foods that are high in sugar are eaten, the intestines have to dilute this mixture by drawing in extra fluid, which causes feelings of cramping, bloating, and diarrhea. The loss of fluid from the rest of your body can cause a drop in blood pressure and additional symptoms listed below. The symptoms may occur 15 -60 minutes after eating and can last as long as two hours. Who is at risk for Dumping Syndrome? It occurs more often after Roux -en-y Gas- tric Bypass, but it can also occur after Sleeve Gastrectomy. What causes Dumping Syndrome? Eating foods that have >15 g of sugar per serving will usually cause it. How can I prevent Dumping Syndrome? You want to do everything you can to prevent this syndrome. It is important to read food labels and avoid foods with >15 g of sugar per serving. Additionally, drink your fluids between meals instead of with food. What symptoms can occur with Dumping Syndrome? Dizziness/weakness Rapid heart rate Drop in blood pressure Headache Shaking Sweating Nausea Gas/bloating Diarrhea Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) Hypoglycemia (Low blood sugar) What do I need to know about hypoglycemia? After gastric bypass surgery, you may experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar <70), which can cause similar symptoms to Dumping Syndrome. Drops in blood sugar can be prevented by: 1. EATING 3 meals per day (DO NOT skip meals) 2. Including protein and carbohydrates (low -sugar) at every meal 3. Avoiding sugary beverages and simple sugars (see Foods to Avoid list below) What should I do if I experience hypoglycemia (blood sugar <70)? If you experience hypoglycemia (blood sugar below 70) or have symptoms , then ... 1. Eat glucose tablets to total 15 g 2. Eat 15 g of protein (see protein list) 3. Wait 15 minutes and recheck your sugar 4. If your blood sugar is still below 70 after 15 minutes, start over at step 1 The body will be able to process the protein and help convert it into sugars that your body needs. Glucose tab- lets are better than other forms of sugar because they do not have the additional fat and calories. Glucose tab- lets can be dissolved in an unconscious person 's mouth. If you are on diabetic medication, talk to your healthcare provider about adjusting your dose. Please contact the Tulane clinic if you experience these symptoms. What foods should I avoid to prevent Dumping Syndrome and Hypoglycemia? Foods with >15 g sugar per Syrups/honey Soda/sweet juice/fruit drinks Cereal/crackers/chips Large quantities fruit Chocolate milk/hot chocolate Applesauce with added sugar Yogurts with >15 g sugar Shakes/smoothies with >15 g sugar Most desserts Dumping Syndrome and Hypoglycemia 45 NUTRITION Part 3: Required Supplements 46 Required Vitamin/Mineral Supplements For the first 4 weeks after surgery, supplements need to be chewable, liquid, powder, crushed or crumbled. You will need to take these two every day for the rest of your life. Multivitamin Your multivitamin should have: Complete or approved chewable multivitamin for at least the 1st month post -op, on pg 47. Take 2 servings of multivitamin , 1x/day with a meal. Separate from Calcium Citrate by at least 2 hours. Do not purchase Gummy Vitamins Sample Schedule: Take 500 mg calcium with each meal and 2 servings of multivitamin with a snack - or - Breakfast - take 2 servings multi - Lunch - take 500 mg Calcium - Dinner - take 500 mg Calcium - Before Bed - take 500 mg Calcium TIPS: download Baritastic app for reminders, set 2 hr. alarms on phone, have set of supplements at work and home. Calcium Citrate + Vitamin D Purchase Liquid or Chewable for at least the 1st month post -op, approved list on pg 47. Supplement 1200 -1500mg total daily. Take 2-3 separate times per day, with meals, since body can only absorb 500 -600mg at one time. Separate from multivitamin. Make sure it is Calcium Citrate. 47 Approved Bariatric Vitamins Approved Multivitamins Chewable (for at least 1st mo post -op) Flintstone Chewable Complete Centrum Adults Under 50 Chewable (NOT EA Celebrate Sleeve Optimized Multi ProCare Health Bariatric Chewable Pills (may start one month post -op) Bariatric Advantage Ultra Multi with Iron Centrum Adults Under 50 Tablets (NOT Centrum Silver) Alive!

Separate calcium and multivitamin/iron by at least 2 hours. Avoid Gummy Multivitamins, Men 's Vitamins, Older Adult and \"Silver Vitamins \". Avoid herbs and herbal extracts without talking to your healthcare provider first. Avoid taking vitamins on an empty stomach, and use water to swallow your pills. Choose the fewest number of other ingredients (e.g. sugars, herbs, caffeine, etc.). Check the expiration date and use by this date. Store vitamins in a cool, dry place. Humid places (e.g. fridge or bathroom) and direct sunlight can destroy vitamins. 48 Vitamin B12 Many patients require a Vitamin B12 supplement at some point. We will monitor your labs regularly and will let you know if you need to add this. Vitamin B12 is available in many different forms: Sublingual (under tongue) Tablet Nasal Spray, available by prescription Injections, done by your PCP Iron Risk of iron deficiency is most common in pre -menopausal women. Others can be at risk as well due to poor intake and impaired absorption. Need 36 mg daily from your multivitamin or a separate iron supplement. Menstruating women will need 50 -100 mg total iron per day. You will need iron in the form of \"Ferrous Fumarate \" May need Vitamin C (or ascorbic acid) with iron to help your body absorb iron Vitamin D Vitamin D is a common deficiency after surgery. Make sure you are getting at least 1000 IU of Vitamin D from your calci- um supplement. If not, take an additional Vitamin D supplement. Best absorbed when taken with food. Thiamine (same as Thiamin or vitamin B1) Thiamine is stored in your body and depletes after 2 -3 weeks. Severe deficiency can cause nausea and vomiting. Check your multivitamin to make sure it has thiamine. Hair loss and supplements May occur after surgery and usually improves after a few months. To help reduce hair loss and help with regrowth: Eat enough protein and take your supplements. Add 2 -5 mg of biotin or take a specialty hair supplement like BioSil. Add fish oil supplements. Kidney Patients If you have a renal dietitian, please consult with them for recommenda- tions on vitamins and supplements or provide us with their contact infor- mation Additional Supplements May Be Needed Monitoring for Deficiencies You will have your lab work taken at regular intervals before and after surgery, either at Tulane or with your primary care provider. Your lab results will determine if you need additional supplements. 49 Recommended Protein Supplements Protein supplements are needed during the full liquid diet, before and after surgery. After that, they are only used if you are not reaching protein goals.

Once you tolerate water without issue, you will progress to a sugar -free clear liquid diet and aim to consume at least 64 ounces of sugar free/decaf fluid per day , unless you are on a fluid restriction. Try to drink at least \u00bd cup (4 ounces) of liquids per hour while awake and stop when you sense fullness or pressure. If you are awake, you should be sipping. Be mindful of sipping liquids very slowly and rest between sips per your personal tolerance. A clear liquid is defined as non -dairy fluids that cause a minimal amount of residue in the digestive tract. You are encouraged to: Check your tray to be sure there are no fruit juices, car- bonated drinks, or anything sweetened with sugar. This diet must be followed exactly to ensure proper healing. You may not feel hun- gry, but you need to drink liquids to prevent dehydration and to help stimulate your digestive system. Don't worry about meals, focus on fluids first and then protein intake . You do not have to separate \"meals \" from other fluids during this phase. Once you are comfortable getting your fluids in, you should aim for 70 -100 grams of protein per day.

Protein options include fish, tofu, MorningStar crumbles, yogurt , cottage cheese, and protein pow- ders/drinks Your PLATE: There should be 3 -6 \"eating times \" a day Start with eating 3 times per day. Increase as needed for hunger or to meet protein goals. Eat protein first. Limit all other foods until you are comfortably consuming at least 60g protein per day. Each meal should be no larger than \u00bd cup. Start separating fluid from meals and remember to sip on fluids between meals. Protein shakes will likely still be necessary to help you reach your protein goals. 75% protein 25% Nausea and vomiting Swallowing a chunk of food may cause you to have pain, nausea, or vomiting. If the food stays down, the pain will persist until the chunk is able to pass through the stomach open- ing. Take the following steps to avoid discomfort with eating: Take Tiny Bites: Use baby or toddler -size utensils to help reduce the size of your bites; use the tip of spoon or fork Chew Well: Chew foods to an applesauce consistency before swallowing. Chew each bite 25 -30 TIMES! Eat Slowly : Meals should take you 30 -40 minutes to eat. Try putting your uten- sils down between bites. Make sure to stop when you feel the first hint of fullness. Do not take longer than 40 minutes to eat a meal because you could end up consuming more calories than needed.

You may now begin eating: lean meats, eggs, shellfish, raw vegetables and salads. Follow these guidelines: The operation is not a cure. To be successful, you must change your eating and exercise habits for life! To maximize your weight loss and limit the risk of regaining weight, follow these tips: 1. Eat slowly and chew well CHEW 25 -30 times per bite. Meals should take you 30 -40 minutes to eat. Try putting your uten- sils down between bites. Stop eating before you feel uncomfortably full. 2. Fully separate eating and drinking Stop drinking 30 minutes before a meal and wait to drink until 30 minutes after . Drinking fluids with meals limits the amount of protein you eat during each meal and can make the food come back up or go through the pouch too quickly. Taking a few small sips with meals to avoid choking or after spicy food is allowed. 3. Meals should contain 3 oz. or 15 -30 g of protein You may have to work up to this at first. Begin adding non -starchy vegetables to meals once able to meet protein goal. 4. Eat only 3 -4 meals/snacks per day Always eat protein first . Avoid mindless eating - listen to your body and eat for hunger. Avoid high -calorie foods, drinks, and desserts. Avoid grazing between meals. Do not eat because you are stressed, bored, \"because it 's there, \" etc. 5. Keep portions small Limit meal size to 1/2 cup initially and work up to 3/4 to 1 cup as tolerated. Never exceed more than 1.5 cups of food at once. Use measuring cups/spoons for serving sizes. 6. Limit Starches Eliminating starches will maximize weight loss. Starch foods can also swell in the stomach and can cause you to become full before you are able to meet your protein needs. 63 Cautions: Eating After Surgery To reduce your risk of complications, discomfort, and weight regain, follow these guidelines. Prevent Vomiting Eating too quickly and too much can cause discomfort, vomiting, and your stomach to stretch (which can lead to weight regain). In very rare cases, extreme overeating may cause your pouch to rupture. To prevent overeating, try: Vomiting is most often caused by overeating, eating too quickly, eating inappropriate foods, taking large bites, or not chewing food well. If vomiting occurs, stop eating sol- id food and sip clear liquids until you are able to resume your intake of normal foods. Episodes of occasional vomiting are common initially and usually improve with time. If vomiting continues for more than 24 hours, call your healthcare provider because this may indicate that your stomach outlet is blocked. Also call your provider if you feel you are unable to consume adequate nutrition for a prolonged period of time or if you feel you are becoming malnourished . If food feels like food is stuck: Sit up straight Walk to help it move through Try a papaya enzyme to help break it up Avoid Gum, Carbonation and Straws Limit chewing gum: Chewing gum is not recommended. If you choose to chew gum, it must be sugar -free. Be very careful not to swallow it, as it can block your stomach outlet and require a visit to the ER for removal. Avoid carbonated beverages and straws: Do not drink carbonated (bubbly) beverag- es (even sugar -free) because the gas caused by carbonation can cause you distress and may stretch your stomach pouch permanently. This is the same concept as straws. 64 Possible Food Intolerances After surgery, some foods can be uncomfortable to eat (particularly those that are dry, sticky, gummy, or stringy). Each individual responds differently to particular foods and most people discover which foods are best tolerated by trial and error. Although some intolerances are permanent, most resolve with time. MILK If you become lactose intolerant, try Lactaid milk, Lactose Free op- tions, Dairy Ease, Fairlife, or calcium -fortified soy MEATS Red meat Pork Poultry (if dry) Shellfish Dry or reheated meat Try moist cooking methods such as boiling, pressure cooking, or using a slow cooker/crock pot. VEGETABLES Raw vegetables Cooked vegetables with tough skins Stringy vegetables (celery, asparagus) Gaseous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, etc.) FRUIT Fruit with tough skin Dried fruit Hard fruit Citrus fruit BREAD Dense bread Bagels Pasta Biscuits Rice BEANS/NUTS/SEEDS All nuts and seeds Legumes or beans Chunky nut butters OTHER FOOD Chili or spicy food Fried or high -fat food Sweets or sugary food EGGS Scrambled eggs are often better tolerated than hard boiled. 65 Protein Non -Starchy Vegetables Starch Bariatric Patient Review List at least 3 foods from each category that you enjoy: Where on the plate does fruit belong? What will I have to avoid after surgery? If I have too much sugar after surgery, what can happen? My fluid goal for the day: My protein goal for the day: I should skip meals to lose weight.
