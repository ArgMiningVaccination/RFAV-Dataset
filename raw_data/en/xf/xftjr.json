{"title": "Lent: A Time for Spiritual Detox", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2023-07-29", "cleaned_text": "Spiritual Detox Lent starts 40 days before Easter. It is a time in which Christians are expected to be still and reflective in preparation. It is a time we go deeper in prayer, offer donations to charities, and give up some of the things we enjoy. We observe the period of Lent because Jesus spent 40 days in the desert, without distraction, preparing for his death and resurrection. In today's world, we usually spend most of our time caught up in our hectic urban lives. Some of us spend hours a day looking at a screen, in air-conditioned comfort, sitting in unnatural light, and consuming processed food. When not at work, we are trying to do too many things at the same time. For instance, we can be watching TV, surfing the Internet, snacking on potato chips and having a drink at the same time. We also have our smartphones in hand to order food, answer our WhatsApp messages, or play mobile games. Our lives may be so full, yet we may still feel empty inside. Many of us have to travel for miles to escape the concrete jungle and as such, we find it challenging to connect with ourselves and discern the steps we need for deeper spirituality. Before we know it, we are in dire need of a spiritual detox \u2014 a cleansing, revitalising treatment for the soul. Learning to live a balanced life will allow the heart and spirit to grow. When the spirit is in balance, life begins to have purpose. So, here are three ways in which you can start your spiritual detox. 1. Explore Nature It's no surprise that just being out in nature can purify and boost your spirit. The plants, the trees, the animals are all God's creations. Being closer to nature feels like being closer to God. You don't need to climb a mountain to feel close to God. Go to a community park, take a walk, stop and smell the flowers, listen to the birds chirping, or just gaze out at open water. The advantages of connecting with nature are huge and are always available - free of charge. But they're also easy to disregard. Turn off that TV. Put down your smartphone. Shut down your computer. Get out and be with nature. 2. Meditate Meditation calms the soul. Make time for some solitude in a space where you cannot be disturbed. Focus on your breathing. Observe each breath as you inhale and exhale. Pray. Reach out to the angels and saints and ask for intercession as you journey through your spiritual detox. The [Meditation Group of OLPS](http://www.olps.sg/world-community-christian-meditation-353) meets every Wednesday 8.00 - 9.00 pm at St John & St Luke Room, Level 2. 3. Do Good Deeds \"If faith is like the root, charity is like the sap that nourishes the trunk and rises into the branches, the network of virtues, to produce the delicious fruit of good works\" (Servais Pinckaers, O.P., Morality: The Catholic View, South Bend, St Augustine Press, 2001) Contrary to the world's constant communication of self-focus and self-care, we are told to surrender our own struggles, rest in Christ, and utilise his power to fight for and help others, so that they can have the rest and peace we've been granted. When we remove ourselves of pride and sin, our actions have the possibility to bring substantial hope and healing. As Psalm 82:3 says, \"Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute.\" We are asked to be the natural guardians under God of the feeble, the impoverished, and the underprivileged. Lent is a time to re-focus, shift away from ourselves, and instead start to live for others. Perhaps to start, we simply need to shut off the computers, deactivate Facebook, and go for a walk. Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI once said, \"The world offers you comfort, but you were not made for comfort, you were made for greatness.\" Let Lent be a time to drop the sheets of comfort and re-discover the special purpose of existence \u2014 to serve in the life of God. ========================== Article by Seraphina Chan OLPS Communications Ministry Disclaimer: The views and recommendations expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the priests of the parish or the Catholic Church of Singapore.
