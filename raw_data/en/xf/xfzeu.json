Update: New Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Program Begins November 1, 2023 Update posted August 4, 2023: This program will begin on November 1, 2023. Starting November 1, 2023, we'll be working with ProgenyHealth\u00ae\u00b4, an independent health care company dedicated to maternity and infant health, to provide Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) utilization management and care management services for eligible members. ProgenyHealth will manage the NICU level-of-care review process and provide comprehensive care management services to babies cared for in the NICU or special care nursery, and for the first year of their life. Babies born prior to November 1, 2023, who were cared for in the NICU, may have their care managed by ProgenyHealth, depending on the level of care. We'll manage the transition to this program. Benefits of the program include: - A dedicated team of specialists from ProgenyHealth that works with the baby's care team to improve outcomes and evaluate external issues that may affect the baby's health. - Additional clinical support for the baby's family that supports a safe discharge. - A dedicated care manager who provides support and education. - An on-call staff member who's available 24/7. Additional prior authorizations won't be required as inpatient NICU services already require prior authorizations. Questions?

Update on Coverage Change for Infused, Injectable Medications Under the Medical Benefit, Effective January 1, 2022 We previously notified you that we planned to change the covered sites of service where your infused or injectable medications are administered. We've decided to make Site of Care a voluntary program rather than a requirement.

What This Means for You If you: - Receive one of the medications listed below, we continue to require prior authorization when the medication is covered under your medical benefits. - Would like to have your medication infused or injected at an alternate site, such as through an in-home service, you can work with your doctor to transfer your care to a home infusion therapy provider in our network, if it's clinically appropriate and with an approved authorization.

We previously communicated that we would implement coverage changes for infused or injectable medications under the medical benefit on September 1, 2021.

For more details, please see [fepblue.org](https://www.fepblue.org/). Since March 2020, we voluntarily and temporarily waived member costs for non-COVID telehealth visits to help ensure member access to health care services and to help prevent COVID-19 infection and illness.

Quality Care Cancer Program Launching July 1, 2021 We're launching our new Quality Care Cancer Program on July 1, 2021, to help ensure that our members receive cancer care that is appropriate and safe, based on clinical guidelines. Through the Quality Care Cancer Program, board-certified oncologists and oncology-trained nurses will be available to discuss covered treatment options with our members' doctors. Our Quality Care Cancer Program applies to all commercial and Medicare Advantage plan members seeking outpatient medical oncology treatment (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and supportive medications), or outpatient radiation oncology treatment. Doctors who order these types of treatments for our members will request Prior Authorization through AIM Specialty Health\u00ae\u00b4 (AIM), an independent company that will administer this program. When a member's doctor submits a treatment plan for prior authorization that meets evidence-based clinical criteria for the cancer being treated, they will get real-time approval. If the requested treatment doesn't meet evidence-based criteria, the member's doctor can request a peer-to-peer consultation with an AIM oncologist to discuss the covered, evidence-based treatments that are best for the member. For a member already receiving cancer treatment at the time of the Quality Care Cancer Program's launch, their doctor will need to request a prior authorization for the continuation of coverage. If a member's treatment plan changes, their doctor will then request a new prior authorization for health plan coverage. Because scientific and medical advances are rapidly changing cancer treatment, and there are wide variations in the way doctors treat patients with the same type of cancer, cancer care quality programs like ours are becoming necessary. The Quality Care Cancer Program is designed to help our members receive the most appropriate and effective treatment regimen, so they can have the best possible outcome with the least number of side effects. If you have any questions, please contact member service. Make a Plan to Get Your Flu Shot Flu season can last through the end of May.

Contraceptives mandate in Massachusetts On Monday November 20, 2017, Governor Baker signed into law the Advancing Contraceptive Coverage and Economic Security in our State (ACCESS) bill.

Enhancements to imaging and sleep management programs We're improving how we manage our imaging and sleep services, increasing the quality and efficiency of both services for members and employers. We now require prior authorization for all imaging and sleep services included in our management programs. AIM Specialty Health (AIM) will manage authorizations. AIM has experience managing imaging and sleep services for our HMO members, as well as for most other Blue plans with approximately 42 million lives under management across the country. For our HMO members The imaging management program, which has been in place since 2005, will move to a full Utilization Management (UM) program for procedures that require a pre-service prior authorization. A UM program requires a Medical Necessity determination prior to the coverage of services. We'll continue to exclude certain provider groups in Massachusetts from the management process when those groups meet established criteria. Your sleep management program, which has been in place since 2013, already requires authorization before the service, and so is unchanged. All provider groups in Massachusetts participate in this process. For our PPO members New requirements for pre-service authorization will go into effect for in-state and out-of-state services. As a result of this change, if out-of-state PPO members don't obtain pre-service authorization, they'll be financially responsible for the cost of services. As with our HMO programs, some Massachusetts provider groups may be excluded from the management requirements for imaging, and all provider groups are required to participate in the sleep management program.

Blue Options and Hospital Choice Cost Sharing update on provider tiers As of January 1, 2016, we updated the hospital and primary care provider tiers for our Blue Options and Hospital Choice Cost Sharing (HCCS) plans. Why we updated our tiers In order to maintain the affordability of our tiered network plans, we periodically review and update our tiers based on the most current provider data. This process encourages the hospitals and doctors in our networks to continue to improve their cost and quality performance. We analyze our tiers based on standard performance measurement principles accepted by local and national physician leaders and measurement experts. This is our fifth update to our tiered network plans. How the update affects you The tier update will change the costs for care received from some doctors and hospitals. Your costs may go up or down, depending on whether a tier is changed for any of your doctors or hospitals.

Member costs for care from some doctors and hospitals in New Hampshire have changed, depending on the new tier a doctor or hospital is in. A network primary care provider or network hospital in NH will now be either: - A Tier 1 (Enhanced Benefit Tier) provider - A Tier 2 (Standard Benefits Tier) provider Network doctors and general hospitals in the New England network located outside of Massachusetts or New Hampshire will continue to be in the Enhanced Benefits Tier.
