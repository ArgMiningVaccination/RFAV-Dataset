Root Races in Theosophy and Anthroposophy: Rudolf Steiner's Evolution \"Readers unfamiliar with Rudolf Steiner's work are often faced with unfamiliar terminology. Part of this is due to the unconventional conceptual space he is working in. But there is also a history to many of the terms. As the General Secretary of the German Section of the Theosophical Society, Steiner was working in an intellectual tradition and conceptual framework from which he initially adopted many of these terms of art. In this detailed book Daniel Hindes explores where the Theosophical term \"Root Race\" came from, how it was used by authors before Steiner and in Steiner's day, and how Steiner himself used the term. By paying close attention to the chronology of usage and frequency of the term overall in Steiner's work\u2014as well as comparing Steiner's published usage with his private letters\u2014Hindes shows a clear evolution from uncritical acceptance of the term in 1903 to an explicit and public rejection by 1908. Supplemental material includes extended passages from Steiner, Blavatsky, A.P. Sinnett, and William Scott-Elliot that make for a fascinating demonstration of contrasting styles, and sheds additional light on how these early Theosophical authors presented similar concepts. \" "}
