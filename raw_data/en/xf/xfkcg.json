Our goal is to build lifelong relationships with our patients and their families.](http://www.northstarmedicine.com/site-files/uploads/2021/04/stethascpoe-round-2-2.png) We can serve as your primary care doctor but are also able to function within an integrated framework, complementing the treatments used by other members of your health care team. This results in a patient-centered approach that strives to provide the most appropriate treatment for the individual. We use an integrative approach utilizing evidence-based natural and conventional medicine. We follow a specific therapeutic order using the least invasive therapies first and utilizing more invasive therapies when necessary. With a focus on prevention we hope to prevent you from needing a specialist but if you do, we will refer you to one. If you already have a primary care doctor we can see you for collaborative care with your other providers. [Acute conditions last a short time and/or are sudden or rapid in onset. They are usually accompanied by a distinct set of symptoms that prompt you to seek health care as soon as possible. For a medical emergency, please call 911.](http://www.northstarmedicine.com/site-files/uploads/2021/04/head-pain-icon.png) The naturopathic approach to acute conditions involves applying the least invasive treatment possible. While that may be surgery or pharmaceutical medications in some cases, naturopathic doctors may have additional options available. We offer conventional diagnosis and integrative treatment options for a variety of acute conditions including but not limited to: - Colds - Ear Infections - Gastroenteritis - Headaches - Musculoskeletal Injuries - Pink Eye - Rashes - Sexually Transmitted Infections - Urinary Tract Infections - Upper Respiratory Tract Infections - Vaginitis [Chronic conditions last a long time and may be insidious in onset. They can be distinct or vague in presentation.](http://www.northstarmedicine.com/site-files/uploads/2021/04/bone-icon.png) We offer conventional diagnosis and integrative treatment options for a variety of acute conditions including but not limited to: - Chronic Fatigue - Insomnia - Menopause - PMS - Thyroid Disorders - Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth - Food Intolerances - Irritable Bowel Disease - Celiac Disease - Anxiety - Depression - Arthritis - Eczema - Autoimmune Conditions - Cardiovascular Disease - Hypertension - Multiple Chemical Sensitivity [We treat a wide range of women's health conditions and concerns using a holistic and integrative approach for women of all ages.](http://www.northstarmedicine.com/site-files/uploads/2021/04/face-icon.png) We offer acute care for a new complaint and chronic care for conditions that have been difficult to treat or require long term care. Examples are PMS, menopause, PCOS, infertility, low libido, osteoporosis, urinary tract infections, painful intercourse, vaginal infections, and so forth. We also offer annual women's wellness exams, which are multi-system. The exams include breast, skin, lung, heart, and abdominal exams, urinalysis and PAP tests when needed. Routine lab work and referrals for appropriate screening tests such as colonoscopy or mammography will be addressed at this visit. [Naturopathic doctors use an integrative approach utilizing the least-force interventions first. We approach patients holistically, considering all physical and psychosocial aspects of a condition.](http://www.northstarmedicine.com/site-files/uploads/2021/04/heart-icon-2.png) The following are a few examples of conditions where a naturopathic approach has been successful for us. One reason naturopaths have had such successes is that we are able to spend the time necessary to focus on the individual aspects of enacting long-term change. Another benefit is our use of tools like nutrition, herbal medicine, counseling, etc. Cardiovascular Disease We use an integrative approach to cardiovascular disease management. We have been successful in reducing the modifiable risk factors for heart disease using an integrative approach. Standard of Care screening and management guidelines will be used including but not limited to physical exams, home health care instructions, diet and exercise education, pharmaceutical management, and when appropriate additional nutritional or herbal supplementation. Food Intolerances We can help you with the diagnosis of food allergies & intolerances, and the dietary modifications that such a diagnosis necessitates. Food allergies may include celiac disease, lactose intolerance, fructose intolerance, or others. Through personal experience we understand how challenging changing one's diet can be, but we will support you through this process one step at a time. Weight Management The approach to weight loss is extremely individual. We do not use any fad diets, calorie counting, weight loss supplements, etc. At North Star we work with you to find your weight loss obstacles. Obstacles include poor diet, too little exercise, stress, depression, chronic pain, hypothyroidism, excessive toxic burden, and more. Our goal is to help you achieve a state of health rather than focusing on an ideal size or shape. We will work with you to develop a weight loss strategy that is realistic for you. Detoxification & Environmental Medicine We recognize that environmental toxins play a role in overall health. Which is why we offer a bi-annual group detoxification program called 28 Day Total Health Reset. This program can be started one on one with Dr. Caselli at any time. We test for heavy metals when appropriate and will assist you in their removal using the most up to date protocols. We can also test for genetic varients, such as methylation defects, that may prevent you from detoxifying appropriately. There is a lot of misinformation about detoxification and cleanses that can be harmful to your health. We can help you sort through this information to find the most supportive way to address any recent toxin exposures and get rid of accumulated toxins in your body. [SIBO stands for Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth. SIBO occurs when the small intestine has become chronically infected with an overgrowth of non-pathogenic bacteria. The small intestine does not normally have a lot of bacteria, but with SIBO, bacteria that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract, including the large intestine, abnormally overgrow into the small intestine. Bacterial overgrowth results in interference with normal digestion and the absorption of food and may be associated with damage to the membranes or lining of the small intestine. The bacteria produce gases and other by-products that may lead to many different symptoms, including but not limited to gastrointestinal symptoms. There are also many different associated conditions and risk factors for SIBO.](http://www.northstarmedicine.com/site-files/uploads/2021/04/stomach-icon.png) SIBO Symptoms: The main symptoms of SIBO are the same as those of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). SIBO has been shown to exist in up to [84% of IBS patients](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Normalization%20of%20lactulose%20breath%20testing%20correlates%20with%20symptom%20improvement%20in%20irritable%20bowel%20syndrome) and is therefore [theorized to be the underlying cause](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15316000). SIBO is also very common in people with IBD, like Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease, and may be contributing to IBD flare symptoms. It is associated with many other disorders as well, either as an underlying cause or as an aftereffect of the pre-existing disease. Some symptoms of SIBO (not exhaustive): - Abdominal pain Asthma and/or other respiratory symptoms - Belching - Bloating - Brain symptoms (e.g. Autism) - Constipation and/or Diarrhea - Cramps - Eczema and/or other skin conditions - Fatigue - Fatty stools - Flatulence - Food sensitivities - Gas - Headaches - Heartburn (reflux or GERD) - Iron deficiency anemia - Joint pain - Mood symptoms (e.g. depression) - Nausea - Skin rashes - Vitamin B12 deficiency - Weight Loss Conditions Commonly Associated with SIBO: - IBS - IBD - Celiac Disease - Diabetes - Fibromyalgia - Rosacea - Joint Pain - Obesity SIBO Testing: We use Genova Diagnostics 3-Hour Methane and Hydrogen Gas Breath Test. Breath testing measures the hydrogen & methane gas produced by bacteria in the small intestine that has diffused into the blood, and then expired by the lungs. Hydrogen and methane are two gases produced by bacteria, not by humans. The gas is graphed over 3 hours & compared to baseline. Patients drink a sugar solution of lactulose after a 1-day preparatory diet. The prep diet removes much of the food that would feed the bacteria, allowing for a clear reaction to the lactulose drink. SIBO Treatment: There are 3 phases of SIBO Treatment: Eradication, Gut Healing and Prevention of Relapse - Eradication Phase Options: - Rifaximin, a pharmaceutical antibiotic - Herbal Antimicrobials - Elemental Diet Formula - Gut Healing Phase: - Nutrients and herbs that support and heal the lining of the digestive track, especially the small intestines - Repopulation of the digestive track with beneficial bacteria supporting the individual microbiome - Replenishing digestive enzymes required for proper breakdown of food - Prevention of Relapse Phase: - Low FODMAP diet for 3 months - Gut motility agents that stimulate the Migrating Motor Complex SIBO Resources: [Low-level chronic infections are implicated in many conditions, including Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Autoimmune Conditions, and many others. They also may play a role in over-stimulating the immune system, thereby contributing to autoimmunity.](http://www.northstarmedicine.com/site-files/uploads/2021/04/cell-and-pill-icon.png) We use conventional laboratory testing in combination with symptoms to determine chronic infection potential. Treatments may include herbal antimicrobials and/or pharmaceutical anti-microbials depending on the severity of test results and symptoms. [Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) can be used for both men and women.](http://www.northstarmedicine.com/site-files/uploads/2021/04/sweating-icon.png) BHRT uses hormones that are identical to the body's endogenous hormones to replenish what the body cannot produce. As aging occurs, the endocrine glands, which include the ovaries, uterus, testicles, thyroid, adrenals, and pituitary gland, begin to lose their ability to produce vital hormones. Because the hormones secreted from these glands all maintain countless bodily functions, men and women may notice drastic changes that occur with aging and hormonal decline. Some of these changes may include insomnia, erectile dysfunction, hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, anxiety, depression, fatigue, high blood pressure, wrinkling skin, bone loss, thinning hair, urinary issues, and muscle atrophy. We do not recommend BHRT for everyone but if you are experiencing symptoms caused by imbalanced or low hormone levels it can be an excellent option. We determine the need for BHRT using laboratory testing in combination with symptom tracking. Our bioidentical hormone therapy treatments are designed for maximum safety and results. [Women's Wellness Exams are a multi-system physical exam including a breast exam, skin, lung, heart, and abdominal exam, urinalysis and PAP test. Routine lab work and referrals for appropriate screening tests such as colonoscopy or mammography will be addressed at this visit.](http://www.northstarmedicine.com/site-files/uploads/2021/04/spine-icon.png) Men's Wellness Exams are a multi-system physical exam including heart, lungs, abdomen, neurological, skin, head and neck, reproductive system, urinalysis and prostate. Routine lab work and referrals for appropriate screening tests such as colonoscopy will be addressed at this visit. Well Child Exams are performed for children between the ages of 1 month-18 years. They are a multi-system physical exam including heart, lungs, abdomen, neurological, skin, head and neck, reproductive system, growth charts, and vaccination discussions. School/Sports Physical Exams can be performed and include the physical exams required by the school. [We utilize laboratory tests in diagnosing and monitoring health conditions.](http://www.northstarmedicine.com/site-files/uploads/2021/04/Mircoscope-icon.png) Laboratory testing involves taking a specimen like blood, urine, or saliva, then either testing it at our our in-house facility or sending it to a lab to run specific tests. Examples include liver enzymes, kidney function, cholesterol panel, blood glucose, blood counts, and many more. We do some blood draws in our office but may send you to a lab for this service. The results will be discussed with you at your follow-up appointment. Lab tests will only be ordered when absolutely necessary. We encourage you to check with your insurance provider, prior to your first visit, to see if they will reimburse for laboratory tests ordered by out-of network providers. See our [insurance page](http://www.northstarmedicine.com/insurance) for details. If insurance does not pay for lab work, we have discounted lab price options through various labs and will make sure you pay as little as possible for the test required. "}
