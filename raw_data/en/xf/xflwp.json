Helpful Tips As one of your media uploads, we encourage you to include a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 if you think that will add to an understanding of your training and experiences. Please keep in mind, information you provide in your arts supplement will only be read by the arts faculty evaluating your supplement unless you submit it as additional information along with your application to Princeton. Changes cannot be made to the optional Arts Supplement after submission. If you wish to include an arts letter of recommendation, it must be requested prior to submission and an arts r\u00e9sum\u00e9 must be included as one of the media uploads, if you wish to submit one. We only accept one submission per program. Your completed arts supplement will be reflected on your Princeton Applicant Status Portal within 24 hours. Documents (for example, additional academic information, research papers, etc.) should not be uploaded with your arts supplement. You may upload those materials through the additional information section of the application or on your Princeton Applicant Status Portal. If you have excelled in an area of the arts not covered by our supplement, we are still interested in seeing how your talent and expertise might enhance our community. You may submit additional materials or links to your work through your application or on your Princeton Applicant Status Portal. Although we cannot guarantee that the Admission Office will have time to review your work, we will include it in your file.

Supplement Type, Category and Description of Acceptable Submissions: Arts Programs [ Architecture ](https://soa.princeton.edu/) The School of Architecture, Princeton's center for teaching and research in architectural design, history, and theory, offers an undergraduate major and advanced degrees at both the master's and doctoral levels. [ Creative Writing ](https://arts.princeton.edu/academics/creative-writing/) The Program in Creative Writing offers Princeton undergraduates the opportunity to craft original work under the guidance of some of today's most respected practicing writers including Michael Dickman, Aleksandar Hemon, A.M. Homes, Christina Lazaridi, Yiyun Li, Paul Kirstin Valdez Quade, and Susan Wheeler. [ Dance ](https://arts.princeton.edu/academics/dance/) The Program in Dance welcomes all students to engage and experiment with dance. At the core of the program is the belief that dance fosters an integration of mind and body that allows for a greater connection to ourselves and our communities. The program provides a depth, diversity, and flexibility of offerings that nurture beginners and challenge pre-professionals. While pursuing a liberal arts education, students have the opportunity to undertake demanding courses with professional choreographers, dancers, interdisciplinary artists, and scholars. [ Music ](https://music.princeton.edu/) As a Music Major, you can engage in independent work in musicology or composition while diving into the intersection of making, studying, and writing about music. Whether our concentrators ultimately choose to make music, to research and write about it, or do both, they are encouraged to develop independent work that moves across traditional disciplinary or methodological boundaries. [ Theater/Music Theater ](https://arts.princeton.edu/academics/) The purpose of the Program in Theater is to engage Princeton students of all kinds in the making of theater with significant artists, faculty members and each other, through studio classes, and through our theater season. The Program in Music Theater brings together students, faculty, staff and guest artists in the creation, study, and performance of music theater. [ Visual Arts ](https://arts.princeton.edu/academics/visual-arts/) The Program in Visual Arts introduces students to the studio arts in the context of a liberal arts education. Offering courses in painting, drawing, graphic design, photography/digital photography, film/video, and sculpture, the program provides enrolled students extensive contact with an accomplished faculty as well as access to technical, analog, and digital labs including darkrooms, ceramics facilities, welding and mold-making areas, a letterpress studio, film editing bays, and a renovated theater for 35 mm and 16 mm film projections.
